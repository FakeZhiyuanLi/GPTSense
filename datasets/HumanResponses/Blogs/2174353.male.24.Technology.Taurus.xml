      That's for sure because you have come to this place and you are reading this. Let me introduce myself first:   I am a year 2000 computer science graduate of  urlLink FAST Institute of Computer Science, Karachi.  I was a topper and share a 3.78 GPA with two other batch mates (Hamid Shahid and Imran Saeed). After graduation, I joined  urlLink Cressoft Karachi  (one of the most prestigious software houses of Pakistan). I managed to clear SCJP exam by 91% and was then selected for IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM Commerce Suite training from IBM Karachi. I had to conduct the same training when I joined back the company after 7 days.   Later in Nov 2001, I joined  urlLink Avanza Solutions  where I was hired to write a middleware and transaction processing engine specialized for the banking domain. Upon completion of the project I was given a 50% increment in pay as well as a promotion. I worked for the next one and a half year on various projects and almost always set examples for others to follow.  I now have a three years of work experience and these days I am trying to move abroad for higher education.  What I have written only describes the events; I'll cover the details, motives behind the decisions and the after affects in some later posts. The posts that follow this one are targetted at people like me, i.e., graduates of computer science who want to create some difference by their knowledge and spirit to work. I am outlining a path for others based on my experience.  If you are a believer, you will surely benefit from these readings .   The first series of the posts will be related to my experience of moving abroad...

       urlLink IELTS Academic Module  is a requirement for admission in many of the non-US universities. A person applying for immigration to the UK, Australia or Canada is required to appear in IELTS General Module. The test consists of four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. There are 10 bands from 0 (being lowest) to 9 (being highest). Usually a score of 7 is considered quite satisfactory.  From Sep 2003, the test fee has been fixed at Rs. 7000/-. The scores of the test are valid for 2 years and you must have a gap of 3 months before re-appearing.   Test Sections:   For speaking part, an interview of about 15 minutes is held. For listening part, you usually hear an audio cassette and have to answer the questions on your answer sheet as you go. The reading part has 3 passages (one of them being quite complex) followed by comprehension questions. The writing part has two tasks (an explanation of a graph and a short essay). The duration for listening, reading and writing sections is 1 hour each.  Speaking and Listening are same for both General and Academic Modules. General Module is easier than Academic Module when it comes to reading and writing.   Preparation:   The test is not very hard; however, it's not as simple as TOEFL. The best method is to self study for reading and listening (and writing too, to some extent). You can purchase Cambridge IELTS Preparation books from Urdu bazaar (for a sum of Rs. 180/-). It comes as a set of 3 books with 4 audio cassettes and covers a lot of ground. For speaking, however, you will need to do practice. In my experience, most of the people find difficulty in this area and it's best to get hold of a friend and start practicing with him [You know that already. Don't you? Why don't you start it from today? Believe me, it will give lots of tension at the end].   In case you are not getting enough time to study independently (or you are lazy in these matters like me), it's better to get admission in a training institutes. There are many and you should attend a class before joining the institute. I would recommend  urlLink The Princeton Review  at Clifton (near Abdullah Shah Ghazi). Back in Sep 2003, they were charging Rs. 4000/- for a one month crash course. Each week, there were three classes and there was one day for full-length test. My only issue with them is that they didn't let us practice speaking part much. Their address follows:  The Princeton Review F-37, 26th Street, Block 4 Clifton, Karachi Tel: 5824726-27 Fax: 5824725  [For those, who don't live in Clifton: with Abdullah Shah Ghazi on your right hand, go straight; cross the round about and walk for a minute; you will find the place on your right hand.]  Beware that IELTS tests your ability to understand and communicate in English - a skill that you have acquired throughout your schooling. By practicing for the test, you can only raise your score by a band of 1 or 2 (which isn't insignificant and it's worth practicing as much as you can).   Applying for the Test:   The test is given by both  urlLink British Council  and Australian Education Office. I am not sure if there is any difference between the two (there shouldn't be any; however, there are rumors that AEO is easier while British Council is preferred by universities and immigration authoritites). The test fee is Rs. 7000/- (as on Sep 2003) and you should plan ahead because there is a lot of rush during admission days. The details below apply to British Council:  You can get the application form from Standard & Chartered Bank, Metropole Branch (near Marriott). Pay the fee; you will be given two copies of the payment slip. Take the form with you; fill it in (don't forget to write a valid email address); attach two photographs, a copy of your ID Card and Passport as well as the Examination Services copy of the fee slip and submit the application pack either at Standard & Chartered or send it via courier to British Council [in that latter case, keep the copy of courier slip with you].  The address of British Council follows:  British Council PO Box 10410 Karachi, Pakistan  Tel: +92 (21) 111 424 424 Fax: +92 (21) 111 425 425 info@britishcouncil.org.pk   You will be informed about your test dates via email. That's why don't give an address on which you are getting too much spam. You will also receive a formal letter and instructions for test a week before your test date. I had applied n Aug 2003 and got an email within a week. The test date given to me was 11th Oct. I received a formal letter on 1st Oct, announcing the test dates to be 6th Oct for Speaking part and 11th Oct for the rest of three tests.    Sample Speaking Test:   General Introduction: -> Introduce yourself -> Why are you interested in computer science? -> What do you intend to specialize in?  Trend Questions: -> Do you like shopping? Which type?  -> What are the trends in young adults regarding shopping? -> Do you like photography? Which type?  -> What are the trends in photography in Pakistan?  Time for Short Speech: -> Describe your room (make notes for 30 seconds and then speak for 1.5 minutes)  Follow up Questions: -> What would you like to change in your room? -> What are the houses like in your locality? -> Do young adults live with their parents in your country? (unmarried adults of your age) -> What are the advantages and disadvantages of living with parents? -> What will be construction of houses like in future in Pakistan?

      Putting all the intermediate details aside, let me start with how my university hunt went. The details are most appropriate for computer science students seeking a Masters level course, though others would benefit too:  There is an e-group named  urlLink SaatFASE  for Pakistanis who want to go abroad for higher education esp to EU states where education is considered a basic right and is free even for international students. You will find emails regarding admission processes and deadlines; help in finding an accommodation abroad; etc.     The Options :  I joined SaatFASE and from there came to know about one  urlLink Rauf Agha  of FAST Institute of Computer Science, Islamabad. He went to  urlLink Chalmers, Sweden  for  urlLink Masters in Dependable Computer Systems  in 2002. The course outline for this post-graduate program is excellent. I would say that Helsinki University, Finland (where Linux was born) and Chalmers, Sweden are very good universities (amongst others). And best of all, there is no tuition fee! There are living expenses though. Also, the chances of getting a job are quite scarce and most probably you will have to return to Pakistan after completing your education. You will find details about Sweden on   urlLink Rauf Agha's website . All the courses are in English but you will need to learn their language in order to find an odd job (with people interaction) or to live there after graduation. Approximately, the same applied to all EU states and their universities.  Another university of high standard is  urlLink National University of Singapore . NUS has faculty and student exchange programs with MIT and is perhaps one of the best universities in Asia. NUS'  urlLink Computer Science Graduate Program  is also very good and most importantly the tuition fee is very low (perhaps, the lowest ones in foreign universities I know). However, admission is very very competitive. The quality of education and the tuition fee make me say that NUS must be given a serious thought.   Then, two of my friends (Kamran Sheikh and Usman Iqbal) were selected for the  urlLink University of New South Wales, Australia  in 2003. The UNSW offers a 1 year Masters course ( urlLink MEngSc in Comp Sc ) for people with computer science background and work experience. The UNSW is arguably the best university of Australia. Their program is relatively costly - about Rs. 800,000/- a year for tuition fee and at least Rs. 250,000/- a year for living expenses. You might find odd jobs to cover some of the living expenses but that's it. People do apply for Australian Immigration at the end of their course but the rules are being changed.    How to Make a Choice :  Before applying to any place, weigh your current standing and make a guideline for yourself. There is only one rule: Wherever you go, choose the best university of that place. The living expenses in developed countries are almost the same. The difference lies in their tuition fee. Amongst English speaking countries, Australia is much cheaper than the USA (where the average tuition fee is about Rs. 1,400,000 per year) or the UK. On the other hand, NUS has a very high standard and much lesser tuition fee. In my opinion your first priority should be NUS if you want to save money. [I am not doing any comparisons with Canada, simply because I don't know much about the education there.]  In case, you don't get admission or aren't interested in NUS, you can apply in some EU country or some other English speaking countries. The only disadvantage of EU countries is that you will most probably have to return after graduation, which makes them excellent choice if you are "research-minded" person. In case of Australia, however, people do apply for immigration after completion of their course.  I chose the UNSW simply because: . I wanted to study in an English speaking country . I couldn't afford the USA . An uncle of mine lives in Sydney . Two of my friends were already living in Sydney and taking the same course  In the posts that follow, I will only discuss the UNSW and the related admission procedures.

      ahem...The journey is going to be much longer than I expected. I have recently been informed that Australian High Commission has started rejecting visas for students seeking admission in Master programs with a 3 years Bachelors. Since, my case is similar, upon persuasion of my consultant I have withdrawn my application.  Interestingly, though, this is a recent policy and wasn't applicable a few months back (Hint: Another batchmate, Usman, went with a similar qualification and a 1.5 year worth of lesser work experience). The restriction might be lifted next year. This means that it's a tailor made restriction and I have been saved from going to Australia at the last moment!   Still, human beings like to cling to their ideas/plans, so I have discussed this issue with Dr. Ata-ur-Rehman and he might help. Anyways, these days I am re-planning everything and have been provided useful insight by some friends (special thanks to Hamid, Kasbati, Kazim, Rashid, Usman and Kami). Most probably, I will apply for Chalmers Sweden and LUMS (or perhaps Canada/England too). Back to the starting track! I would be glad if somebody joins me in this effort. I might also attempt at GRE in the first two quarters.  The result of the whole activity has been that I got an 8.5 in IELTS; I have gathered some pretty good information on studying abroad; also became good friends with a few education consultants and some hard-working Pakistanis studying abroad.  Just a regular update from my side...    "I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe. It is that nature that has again brought you to me.

       Design Patterns  is a fancy word in the field of computer science, frequently abused. I take this opportunity to apply the word with reference to Mother Nature. Just as a design pattern serves as a blueprint for solving one particular kind of problems, there are patterns in the nature itself. And just because I have a limited vocabulary, I have used the word Design Pattern. Let me know if you can term the following something else:  . System within Individual: Life and its Definition . Orbital Motion . Ingredients of a Genius . Alignment of Elements: The Power Hence . Attraction Towards the Opposite: The Quest for Completeness . Generalizing Khans, Blacks and Sikhs (without any racial discrimination)     System within Individual: Life and its Definition  Let me start by putting a question:  What are you - an individual or a system?  If you think for some time, you are both. And your answer would /should be: "depends on your level of abstraction."   I would then like to put another question:  "So if you are a system, why do you think you have life?"  And if you are not a thinker this might be a perplexing question.  Let me approach from another direction. If I say that a room in which you are sitting alone is full of life, would you believe me? Think about the micro-organisms and the activities they are doing every moment. If a cell has life then each cell of your body might think that "it has life and it's actually working inside a dumb system with other cells."  Now consider the organization where you work/ study. Isn't each individual person part of a system - whether it's a company or an institute? Does the company have life?  Is your educational institute an 'organism'?   Start examining a bee hive - it's a complete system. See inside the hive, you will find individuals - the bees. Take a bee as an individual and dig deeper, see the digestive, neural, respiratory and other systems. Look further inside, you would see a system of tissues and then cells. Don't stop, explore a cell thinking it's an individual and not a system - you would find another complete system (cell membranes, nucleus, acids, etc.). But does it end here? Isn't an acid a system of atoms of various elements? Is an atom an individual or is it again a system of electrons, protons and neutrons? If you think that an electron is not a system, I sympathize with your knowledge of quantum physics [There are  urlLink Leptons, Baryons, Mesons and the forces ].    urlLink Is an electron matter or energy?   Are  you  matter or energy?   Re-start from the bee hive and this time start moving in upward direction of abstraction. You will move up and up and will never finish. There is a system within every system!  Our concept of life validates only the systems that work as an individual at our level of abstraction!   They say  a little knowledge of science takes you away from religion and a comprehensive knowledge of science brings you back!  Think about it and let me know via your comments!

      Amongst many non-exciting but important things that need to be done in life is "improving your vocabulary." No matter how much you run away from it, you can't deny its importance. Follow some of the software that I have been using:   urlLink SAT GRE Crash Course : A shareware version can be downloaded from  urlLink here . You can run it 30 times before it gets expired. The application organizes Word Lists according to the level of difficulty. After a round of study, you get a chance to test yourself in many ways (fill-in the blanks; multiple-choice questions, etc.). Also, you can maintain a list of "difficult" words for reviewing purpose...a must have, in short.   urlLink WordWeb : This is a general purpose English Dictionary. To get meanings (plus synonyms, antonym, etc.) just select a word on your screen and press the hot-key. The best part is that it has a very small footprint (if we can use the word for such small apps) and it's  urlLink freeware .  The above should be sufficient but in case you are looking for more, get hold of "Vocabulary  Wizard 6.3" by  urlLink Prosigner  (search on  urlLink Download.com  if you can't find the latest version anywhere else). This one is Adware but a very organized way of learning that gives you score to each word that you have studied, depending on how many times you got it wrong (or right).     Keymaker : But like all systems it has a weakness. The system is based on the rules of a building. One system built on another.  Morpheus : Electricity.  Keymaker : If one fails, so must the other.

      This is the first post since I withdrew my visa application. Contrary to what people anticipated, it didn't disturb me much. I am now used to re-planning at an average of once in 15 days. I have started feeling that there is a path for all of us and if we don't follow it willingly, we are dragged towards it [More on this is to come in later posts].  I have now applied to  urlLink Chalmers University of Technology  for  urlLink MSc in Dependable Computer Systems . I shall also be applying to  urlLink MS Computer Science  program offered by  urlLink LUMS . In one way, I am severely handicapped due to a 3 years degree.   Right after the graduation some of the batch mates enrolled into SZABIST for a 1 year MCS just to overcome this handicap and some others continued their studies at FAST (leading to a BS conversion and then to an MS). I couldn't enroll into either. For one, the fee of  urlLink SZABIST  was higher than I could afford at that time [even the three years had been very tough financially]; secondly, the quality of education isn't acceptable at post graduate level in Pakistan; thirdly I was very disquieted because of the administration at FAST [Again, more on this is to come in later posts]; lastly, I didn't want to work half-heartedly [managing job and studies at the same time and not doing either with full devotion]. Still, not everyone feels these points as hindrances in a strict sense but the last point is valid for me even today.   Now when I look back, I feel I might have been better off with a 4th year of education. But decisions in the past are made based on the information available in the past and they shouldn't be re-evaluated based on the information that is available NOW. I am trying to demystify the reasons behind an irksome and dull life - I have found many and read quite a few things in the process; I might become a philosopher one day!    I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?   (Morpheus: What is the Matrix?)

      I wanted to write another pattern but couldn't squeeze out time this weekend. Here is a quick review of  Software Architecture Tour 2004  arranged by Microsoft Pakistan in Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, Karachi. The event was on Saturday (27th Mar). The following speakers were there:  1.  Jawwad Rehman  - MS Country Manager 2.  Vaqar Khamisani (AI wala)  - Developer Evangelist and ISV Manager, Microsoft 3.  Gurkan Salk (from Turkey)  - Developer Evangelist MS MiddleEast/ Africa 4.  Rai Umair (an SZABIST BCS student)  - INETA Pakistan Chairman (self-declared) 5.  Haseeb Abdul Qadir (Pakistani)  - Software Design Engineer, Redmond, MS USA 6.  Khurram Shakir (FASTian 97)  -  Software Architect, Kalsoft  It was well organized; there were more than 100 participants, almost all of them professionals.  The event started with  Jawwad Rehman's  speech who emphasized upon the quality of education at BS level. He also told that they are pushing hard to introduce "Best Practices/ Inhouse Training Practiced at MS" as elective courses at BS level in universities.  The second speaker was  urlLink Gurkan Salk  who talked mostly on  urlLink Service Oriented Architecture  and it's comparison with Object Oriented Architecture. He discussed things only at conceptual level. However, it was one of the two presentations from which I learned something directly.  The third speaker was our very own  Vaqar Khamisani . He joined and left  urlLink Clarusoft  after Neovision and has now joined MS. Though a very knowledgeable person, his presentation was the most boring and off-topic. His topic was "Business Intelligence through Data Mining." Needless is to say that he repeated many basic concepts of AI and didn't talk of anything new.  The third speaker was  urlLink Rai Umair  - a kid who is doing BCS from SZABIST. He believes that he is a representative of International .NET Association Pakistan and tried to motivate people to join him in the NUG. Gave out his phone number :) and talked of many innocent ideas.  Then was  Haseeb Abdul Qadir . He is a grad of University of Toronto and is currently a Software Design Engineer for  urlLink Windows Error Reporting  Module in Windows XP and Longhorn. He was very impressive in terms of communication skills and knowledge of the subject matter - but WER isn't related to us (the ISV's) as MS requires contracts with subscriptions to use it for your applications.  The last was our very own  Khurram Shakir  - the only speaker who spoke in Urdu. His topic was Design Issues with Multi-threaded Applications in .NET. [If you don't know Khurram Shakir, let me tell you he is a great coder though he lacks good communications skills.] He talked of various classes and methods related to multi-threading in .NET. But most of the matter can be easily found in MSDN and there was nothing impressive, except his knowledge that spans from COM (STA and MTA) and Java to .NET.  The event had nothing to do with Software Architecture. And like always, we are far far behind from where we should have been - morally.      Carpe Diem - Seize the Day!

      Much has been said and written about the quest for completeness in human beings and thus the attraction towards the opposite. What we term as attraction is actually "completeness being sought." This completeness can't be attained by merging the opposites but by merging things that complement each other.  Take example of two  opposite  poles of a magnet. What the north pole possesses isn't available to the south pole and what the north pole lacks can only be fulfilled by the south pole. Thus, they get attracted and combine to manifest unity.   Look into another example of two  oppositely  charged particles. Both positive and negative particles actually seek "completeness" which makes them come close to each other and thus unite. Positive and negative charged particles are not opposites [ They don't cancel each other. "Light" and "dark" are real opposites. ] Charged particles complement each other to form unity.  Everything in this universe is in search for its missing parts.   What makes Na (sodium) react with Cl (chlorine)? If you remember lessons from your high school chemistry, sodium has 1 electron in its outermost shell while chlorine has 7. Sodium can "complete" its outermost shell by losing one electron (where completeness is defined as having the last shell 2 or 8 electrons) and chlorine can "complete" its outermost shell by gaining an electron. Thus, its the universal quest for completeness that makes them have an attraction towards each other and hence combine to form sodium cholride (table salt).   And based on my experience I would say that people who are almost alike in personalities can never constitute a good friendship; there is usually a teacher-student relationship in these cases or worse: there is professional jealousy in these cases. So even our friendship is a manifestation of a lost part of our- self . And this brings me to a very perplexing question:  "Where exactly do I end and where exactly do you, my friend, begin?"

      The effect of diversity on the quality of a solution is interesting. But I must say that diversity is itself a manifestation of unity! Otherwise, what good these patterns are! One would be justified in saying that application of these patterns to human beings is really complex. Actually, the complexity arises from only one thing:  choice!  This very word is one of the core issues discussed in the trilogy of Matrix movies.    Agent Smith : Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why, why do you persist?  Neo : Because I choose to.  (Matrix Revolutions)    The issues are getting out of my grasp but still the comments provide an alternative view point of some intelligent people. On with the show:    Stagnation is Death:   Have you ever wondered why 0K (Zero Kelvin) is the lowest possible temperature?  Life is all about being dynamic. Everything in the entire universe is moving - from things smaller than electrons to solar systems and beyond. Matter can't be at rest. If it ceases to move, it ceases to exist!  urlLink An atom must retain at least one quantum of energy and this keeps it from cooling below Absolute Zero.   This means that nothing can ever be at rest.   What we term as death is actually a portal - from this world to the presumably broader one. Another form of death within this world lies in being  stagnant  or in other words, having the state of in-activity - a scholar who no more thinks of new ideas is dead, an IT professional who can't pace with the emerging technologies is obsolete, etc.   Occurrence of events is must for imparting knowledge.  The amount of knowledge gained from the occurrence of an event is directly proportional to its rarity (or inversely proportional to its frequency).  Building on the example of the last pattern, when you are pushing a car even in the wrong direction, at the least, you are doing something. And this  doing something  is very important. In no time, one of the enlightened persons, amongst those who are pushing the car, will realize the wrong way! He would announce it and make sure that people understand the idea. And making mistakes (and learning from them) is as important as doing it right.  But what if there is a stalemate - a situation where everyone is waiting for everyone else to do things for them? Or when everyone is motionless just to avoid some inescapable situation; to avoid a future that exists only in the minds? In the words of Noon Meem Rashid (if I can recall them correctly):   Un-kahi say dartay ho? Jo abhi naheen howa hai, us ghari say dartay ho? Un-kahi to tum bhi ho, un-kahi to hum bhi hain. Khud say tum naheen dartay?   where khud: self, ghari: moment, un-kahi: something that hasn't been said yet.

      Some of you might be right that life exists only when "the part lives and dies/ has identity within" the whole. As one can argue on anything, I might say that  what exactly is within?  And we will never reach anywhere. Instead of putting questions just for the sake of argument, I am trying to demystify things and thus will come back to this question sometime in future (when I have a reasonable answer). But do keep your thoughts pouring in!  Present day science and common sense do not explain everything. Still both are the tools that have enabled mankind to come this far. There is a parallel way of  being powerful :  urlLink the paranormal explanation of things . Having interest in both paranormal experiences and scientific laws as well as their intersection, I am not going to support either. This blog is about life in general and practical social life in particular. So this time I am going to discuss the alignment of elements:   Alignment of Elements: The Power Hence  What is the difference between an iron bar and a magnetic bar? No, I am not interested in being told that one attracts the other and hence has power. What I want to know is the difference in internal structures. You can take a piece of iron bar and magnetize it by rubbing a magnet from end A to end B repeatedly (always in the same direction). This would magnetize the iron and give it power; but what has actually changed?  urlLink It's the orientation of atoms within the iron bar.   Take another example, think of a group of people that are pushing a car where everyone is disoriented and pushing it in a different direction. Where would it take them? Nowhere! What if they are properly aligned and asked to push the car in one specific direction? If all the elements get aligned the power originates from within!   Re-apply this pattern to anything and you would conclude that dis-orientation is powerless and alignment gives you power!  The first example is more enlightening in the sense that it seems a bit esoteric. Taking a step further I would say that merely thinking in the same direction (alignment of thought) is very powerful - perhaps that's  the basis of importance of prayer with jama'at (congregation) .  Do share your thoughts.   "Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it. I thought you'd have figured that out by now."

      The chapter on Patterns has finally been closed.  I'll rethink over all the issues and this might become the foundation of a book on life. The next few blogs will review a couple of books followed by entries on technology/ career in software development.  A few months ago, I partially read  urlLink The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment  by  urlLink Ekhart Tolle . I couldn't finish the book as it is repetitive at many places and I seldom get even an hour of leisure in a day. Still it's a good read if you can spare some time. The crux is that there is a hairline  difference between Life and Life Situation . Our life situation starts from a time in past and ends at somewhere in future - it's a span with starting and ending points - a line.  Life, on the other hand, is  NOW . It's a moment - a point - a reality. Life situation is imaginary because past is no more with us and future is what we never experienced. Most of the problems that we think we are facing are with the life situation; you will hear people complaining: My exams are going on these days and I am under pressure; I am in debt; My parents aren't happy with me these days; I am not progressing in my current job, etc.  Contrarily, mostly there is no problem NOW. What problems are you facing while reading this text? You must thank Almighty for the breath that you take without any difficulty, the eyes that are letting you read this and the mind that is processing the information as you read and enables you to follow the complexity of this text without requiring a re-read.  Amongst other interesting things discussed by the author is the treatment given to  mind . According to him, mind is a tool like other parts of body that is meant to be used; it shouldn't start working on its own and thus create  noise . To be present and alive in Now is what the book tells you to do - stop living in past or future. I leave the rest for you to explore.  Great minds have concluded that  urlLink time is an illusion . Let's take the example of a star that is at a distance of 100-light years from Earth.  When you see such a star in the sky, you are actually seeing the past!  It was there about 100 years ago and may not be there anymore because the light has already taken a hundred years to reach you.  But doing is more important than mere reading. And "to believe" is even more important. Whenever you finish reading a book, don't just continue with another - assimilate what you have learned. As a friend says, "Be the change you want to see in this world."    One half of nothing is still nothing.  (somebody commenting on Eric Lippert's blog)

      What's common in  urlLink Einstein  and  urlLink Edison  apart from the starting letter of their names?  urlLink Einstein was one of the most dull students of his class  until he started studying Mathematics after high school (with support from his  urlLink father  and uncle).  urlLink Edison was considered a symbol of disgrace by his teacher . But his mother withdrew him from school and taught science to him herself! Both the men were genii and their creations have significantly affected our lives.  Nature has rules and they aren't usually violated.  I believe that there are rules that dictate when to give birth to a genius!  At the least, I have found one thing common in every person who is commonly thought of as a genius: One or both of the gifted child's parents belong to the same field in which he later shows expertise. It's the continuous struggle and interest of the parents which gives the child a good start - a start from where his parents left off!  An individual is based on two things: what he inherits from his parent(s) and how the environment affects him. In terms of being eminent, these correspond to hereditary intelligence and hard work. Also, I believe that if you are interested in some field but couldn't prove to be "eminent" in it, try putting your child into it in very early ages. The results would be very promising.  These ideas of mine are based on the biographies of great people that I read during my student years. However, recently, I was surprised to learn that  urlLink Francis Galton  did an extensive research on similar lines and published his work as  urlLink  Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry into Its Laws and Consequences   in 1869. He studied men from various fields of life: men who are born leaders, great warriors, eminent scientists, gifted poets, etc. He, then, checks the family tree of these eminent people to discover parents/ siblings in the same field - in a very thorough manner as compared to what I did.  Quite interestingly, though Darwinish it may sound, Galton states that  particularly in order to be a successful person in science, you need to have an able mother  and I agree. Ofcourse, there is a margin of error in everything and that's where probability kicks in!    Why? Because I believe something you do not? No! I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me, but because of the path that lies behind me!  (Morpheus: The Matrix Reloaded)

      For every activity there is a center, like the vortex of a whirlpool or the yolk of an egg. Usually there is an orbital (or at least a fixed) path associated with the surrounding particles. The center not only provides the centripetal force which is necessary for orbital motion but sometimes has other very important functions to perform. For example,  urlLink here's an article  which states that the nucleus is really the living cell's mothership, a crucial and very active source of information, support and control.  Though not exactly orbital, blood circulates in the body following a fixed path, going through the heart. The heart is the center and the only instance of blood violating it's definite path is when bleeding occurs.   The orbital motion is very prominent in the electrons tied to every atom's nucleus; the moon of every planet; the planets of every sun, etc. Not surprisingly, Muslims revolve around Ka'aba during Haj. This center of all the activity has to be practically demonstrated at least once in a lifetime.   If something breaks its designated path, it goes astray.  The suns and moons are very obedient creations (some people would like to replace the word  obedient  with  dumb ). But man has been given  choice , which unfortunately is a very complex topic. The life of a human being can revolve around many centers. Or in other words, the center keeps shifting. To realize/ recognize our true center is the first and foremost duty.  A long time ago, PTV telecasted a very good drama with the title,  "2 Suraj ka Siyara"  (which translates into  A Planet of Two Suns ).  Are you a planet of more than one sun?     "I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?"  (Merovingian: The Matrix Reloaded)

      So you are a team lead? Are you a  good  team lead? The simplest possible explanation of the use of the term  good  can be " a team lead whose team members want to be like him ."  Certainly if you have spent a few years in this field, you have learned the basics and should be considered as somebody who not only can work independently but can also guide others. What skills would be most important? Being a software team lead is no different than being lead of, say, a football team. Your personal contribution to the work itself, your communication/ co-ordination skills and your confidence matter most.  In our local industry, a developer is promoted to this position as early as 1-3 years of work experience. And almost always, for a given project /set of tools, he knows the most. If he gets stuck up somewhere he has to rely on self-help. Not many places are able to retain people with more than 3 years of experience. So where do you learn from?   You probably don't have any one who can guide you in your company; nor you will find someone who can be a source of inspiration that easily. But have you looked outside your company? Are you part of some group that meets and discusses problems and their remedies over a cup of tea, lunch, etc.?  Be a bit social and you will find many people of your age and experience that can help you tremendously in your grooming, knowledge and outlook towards things - people like you who are trying to make a difference in their respective organizations (companies, communities, etc.). Look, for example, at  urlLink FAST 2000  and the  urlLink Linux Pakistan  team.  Secondly, if you are really interested in software development, have you tried the  urlLink open source  alternative? Open Source software development is a blessing for people in countries like ours. While sitting in the comfort of your home, you can interact and work with the best of the best! There are hundreds of extremely interesting projects going on over the web; such as,  urlLink Tomcat  (Java Web Server),  urlLink Mono  (.NET on Linux),  urlLink Open Office  (Multiplatform MS Office Alternate) and  urlLink Mozilla  (the ultimate web browsing suite), amongst many others. Just to give you an inspirational feeling, read the biography of  urlLink Linus Torvalds here  and the famous quotes of him  urlLink here .  In my opinion, one of the best places to learn software development is the  urlLink Mozilla Project . And the best place to start from is to download and see the quality of these applications. Try  urlLink Win HTTrack  and  urlLink Fire Fox: The Browser, Reloaded  amongst others. Then, based on your interest and programming skills search a project of your liking on  urlLink Source Forge  and be part of the development team.   And the third option to help you in improving your knowledge and skills (and also earn a bit of money) is to make a team and get projects from the web. The topic of free lancing is a bit broad (ranging from how to find a project to details on bidding and what not to do). I'll write more on free lancing sometimes later.  Once you are sure that you have extra knowledge that you can disseminate, give reading assignments and informal presentational work to your team. There are many interesting topics like     urlLink Difference between ADO, DAO, OLEDB, ODBC, MDAC, RDO, etc.    Practical demonstration of a two-phase commit    urlLink Red-black Trees     urlLink Working with Google Web Service    etc.      I am only that part of me whom I have met.

      This post focuses on the most important component of any knowledge based organization - the people; or specifically, the Software Developers in a software house. I won't be talking of Quality Assurance Engineers at the moment.  Somebody said, " The top is always vacant " meaning thereby that you can always work hard and reach the top. Unfortunately, in case of our country (and particularly in software development), the middle part is also scarcely populated. Just to give you an example of the quality practices, here is a slightly modified example of code from PTV Marketing System developed by a local ISO 9001 certified company and the largest software house of its time in 1999-2000:   dim jugar as boolean dim shazia as integer  if (jugar = true) then 	shazia = 1 	msgbox "Khatarnak Shakeel" end if    urlLink Scott Meyers  in his book " urlLink More Effective C++ " gives an example of some weird code and says, " Such developers should be caught and punished till they either mend their ways or cease to exist. "  Needless is to say that the project was never managed properly, the customer was annoyed to the extent that he took it to another vendor and in the end the code had to be re-written by a duo of local Ramboes, Salman Kasbati and Mateen. They properly ended the project and managed to get the last installment of the payment from the client.  According to  urlLink Microsoft Secrets ,  urlLink Bill Gates  holds the view-point (and not many will disagree) that design documents shouldn't be separate from the source code.  urlLink Chris Peters  said, " …a developer's job is to write code that we sell, not to spend time writing high-level design documents ." Bill Gates supported by saying, " One document. One. It's the source code. It's the one place you go. You learn everything there, and you know everything there.  " If you come from the open source background (or even something like XP) you will understand what I am trying to tell. However, if you are like me and come from the top-down approach to software development, it's difficult to digest. Experience will teach you (just be attentive to the lessons of time)!  Most developers write code as if they had been forced to; most probably at gun-point. Some basic things like variable naming, duplication of code, indentation of lines aren't taken care of. You will find developers making large claims that they know .NET or J2EE or Java Security API or System.Data.SqlClient assembly, etc. but if you read their code you will feel if they have vomited. Trust me when I say that it’s not something to be proud of if you can read an article in MSDN or Javadocs and can imitate in your code.   Nothing makes a fellow developer as uneasy as what it takes to understand and debug poor code written by someone else. I wish every software house forced fresh grads read  urlLink Code Complete  (or something to that effect). To improve the standard of code, the practice of  urlLink code review  should be strictly enforced.   Lastly, many times I have seen code like this one (again Visual Basic):   dim rs as adodb.recordset Set rs = new adodb.recordset Set rs = dbConn.execute ("select * from myTable")   Can you see what's wrong? What's line #2, after the declaration of rs and before getting the recordset, doing here?  urlLink Eric Lippert  attributes such code to  urlLink cargo cult programming  where the developer has seen code like this and is invariably following it everywhere, without understanding what each line is doing. Or more importantly, is each line required? Is there a better way to do this?  My earnest advice to fellow developers is:   For God's sake, write code that speaks well of you: You are an engineer; be proud of what you build!   Understand what you are writing: Don't be a cargo cult programmer!   Stop running after buzz words: know the basics first, go on to understanding meanings of the jargons, then learn designing skills and only then move to specialize in one particular set of technologies!   Get code reviewed: Introduce the practice of Code Reviewing in your company!

      Does any one really know  urlLink software engineering  here? I regret to say that in my experience of 3.5 years, I have come across only 4 or 5 good developers - who really know how to develop software. Yes, this field is new and there are  urlLink many orthogonal schools of thought in software process . But let me tell you the simplest possible definition of a good process:  if it sells and gets used, your code is perfect and your development methodology is the best in the world . On a more realistic note, your code and design are perfect if code maintenance is easy.  Software development is complex because nevertheless, it's engineering and secondly, software by definition is flexible (read "soft") as compared to other engineering disciplines. The most difficult part of the development cycle is to have good project managers. You can't put non-technical managers on top of technical people that easily. Nor you can expect good management skills from  coders  who don't learn anything in their life except punching keys.   The development phases of a software project taught in university courses are Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition/ Deployment. I and my friends usually put a "Rambo" phase just before deployment -  when everything is a complete mess and somebody from outside is brought in and asked to re-work on the already lost situation . The Rambo has a reputation of doing incredible things single handedly and more often than once he successfully does what a team of 5 or 10 people couldn't do!   It is an established fact that  urlLink some developers are 10 times more productive than others  . But it's rare to find a significant difference in the wages given to the best developers at a particular level of hierarchy. Additionally, many companies say that they give stock options, employee referral bonus, twice an year technical-financial reviews, etc. but do not hold to their promises. This with other factors effectively results in exporting our best people to developed countries; what's being left behind isn't being properly trained and mentored - resulting in a complete chaos.  Mujtaba Karim, a senior  urlLink FASTian  whom I worked with in  urlLink CresSoft , says that the real-life phases of software development are Project Kickoff, Wild Enthusiasm, Incomplete Requirements Gathering, Disorientation, Complete Chaos, Promotion of Non-performers and Resignation of Key Resources.  Unfortunately, this is not the story of one particular project or company, some players in the global market and almost all of the local software industry are repeatedly making the same mistakes and have adapted a habit of not learning from the mistakes of others.    "We're going to QueryInterface the object for a magical IGeoff interface that will allow us to do wacky, incredible things.  But I don't understand how it works yet because Geoff hasn't told me."

      I came across  urlLink The Alchemist  a few months ago. Somebody gifted the book to my elder brother and I got a chance to skim through it. Once I started reading, I put down the book only after finishing it. And since then I have recommended it to many friends.   The book, written by  urlLink Paulo Coelho  is actually fable of one Santiago - a shepherd  who has a dream as well as the courage to follow it . The story of Santiago has important lessons that might go a long way with your life. It's about taking risks, the net result of every effort, the relationship between occurrence of events and improvement in characters as well as lessons on merging with the flow of nature. Don't underestimate the story by my description, it is very captivating. Everything is metaphorical and there are no direct lessons in philosophy. Though some of you might find some marketing elements of story writing in it, it's still a good read.  If you ask me to recommend a single book written by people from our era, based on my limited knowledge of literature, I would recommend "The Alchemist." You can get  urlLink the book in paperback  from  urlLink Liberty Books  for Rs. 250/-.    "When you want something, all the  universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."  (The Alchemist)

      These days I am in Doha,  urlLink Qatar  for deployment of a check book printing solution. It's an exciting project with a good mix of technologies: an NCR kiosk with touch screen display, a  urlLink Rototype CBD1000  machine that will print checks and bind them together; integration with the backend systems ( urlLink MS SOAP Toolkit  3.0 and Oracle stored procedures) and the best part is that it's bilingual - English and Arabic - what else would one desire?  [As a side note, my company,  urlLink Avanza Solutions , is better than its  urlLink competitor  in many ways; the most important difference is our aggressive nature. They being older in the market are now mostly supporting their products only. We, on the other hand, are open to changes/ enhancements in our products.]  If you ask me what is the most difficult part of software life cycle, I would say, "Going Live!" Somehow, software deployment takes as much time as development. Ideally one would like to have one button to click in order to deploy software! So what exactly are the gray areas that take so much time?  The problem, first of all, lies in the attitude of developers. Only few write code with a user in their minds or more specifically with the notion that it has to go live. Almost every developer that I have seen to-date takes software development as an exciting problem solving activity and never looks into those areas of the problem that seem less exciting (like security, exceptional cases, wrong input, performance issues, testing on a different environment, etc.) Since all such issues must eventually be resolved in order to go live, a lot of activity just before deployment is related to these ignored areas.  Secondly, for every piece of software to run, there are pre-requisites - like a database, service packs, a particular version of web browser, etc. Usually, the responsibility to provide these lies with the customer. However, due to the fragile and intangible nature of software [and the dear customer being naive in general], the customer expects the deployment personnel to set everything up. I am not sure how we can change the client's attitude. But they say that if something is inevitable (your software sure has to go live, right), you are better off by being part of the change rather than resisting it. After all, " Whose project is it anyway? "  On a related note, I have observed a very interesting characteristic amongst human beings -  if you volunteer for something, everyone thinks that it's your responsibility to lead.   So what's the point? The point, " Go out and take over project management " - even if it's not your responsibility. Once you volunteer for the ownership, people will expect you to help them out - even seniors and those who don't come under your supervision will accept you as the boss!  However, there is one particular situation where I'll advise you to roll back instead of taking up the ownership: when the customer is least interested in the solution. This frequently happens when it's a low cost project or when it's merely a presales activity. Be very careful how much time to spend on a pre-sales activity and how much interest the customer has.  Deployment and software support are the most boring part of the life cycle. At the same time, they are what everything else is all about.  While one person might be waiting for hours for an IP to be assigned at the client side, other developers might get assigned to a brand new, exciting project . A software house should help its support engineers by improving their morale and appreciating their patience and diligence - a bonus per deployment shouldn't be surprising - after all the company gets money when the software goes live.  Isn't this gone a bit lengthy? Actually  I have been waiting for more than 2 days for the client to find the keys to the printer that he has managed to loose!  Software deployment  is  boring. Would you bet otherwise?    Limited in his nature, infinite in his desire,  Man is a fallen god who remembers heaven.  (Alphonse De Lamartine)

      I am of the opinion that the local QAEs (Quality Assurance Engineers) are doing a good job as compared to the developers. But they say, " Quality is a process and not a goal ," indicating that there is always room for improvement.  This post identifies two very common issues with Quality Assurance and their causes.  Has your QA team ever reported anything like "this feature is difficult to comprehend for novice users" or "it takes too much time to start the application?" The activity in the arena of  urlLink better software  is mostly related to testing only - the whole emphasis is on finding the sequence of inputs that make the application crash and that's it. We must understand the difference between  mere testing  and  quality assurance  and thus, in a Test Engineer (TE) and a Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE).   The problem partly has its roots in non-availability of vision/ specification documents. How can the QA team report performance issues if there was no such criteria /metric defined at the start of the project? Just how easy was it meant to be? Just how fast it was supposed to be? No document in the software development life cycle is as important as the feature specification document. The QA team needs to emphasize on the availability of this document before the first testing iteration begins.  The second problem lies in the  us versus them  attitude between QAEs and Software Engineers (SEs). Developers, in general, don't like to re-work on something. When they are told of bugs in their software, the majority tries to shun the responsibility. Most of the time the response is, "But it works on my machine." Also, the developer gets annoyed at the very poor description of the problem. A QAE makes the problem worse by creating a mockery out of this thing. The QA people can help in changing the attitudes by being courteous and by providing a correct description of the problem as well as sufficient details for reproducing the bug.  The two problems [testing instead of quality assurance and us-versus-them attitude] have a single, common cause.  There is always a knowledge gap between QAEs and Software Engineers (SEs) . Certainly, a QAE isn't  required to know  how a particular feature is implemented but knowing internals won't hurt either. Most of the places don't require QA people to work extra hours (as compared to developers who invariably do late sittings and work more than 40 hours a week). I would advise the QA personnel to try to build expertise (in their spare time) on at the least one programming language - VB, C# and Java are very good choices. And more importantly, try to learn the inner working of Operating Systems and Application Servers. This way, you can tell what bugs/ issues are with the software you are testing and which problems are due to improper configuration of databases, OS and other third party tools. With every project try out newer ideas such as automated testing, unit testing frameworks, etc.  An organization that practices self-improvement is difficult to beat. QA folks can help by minimizing the knowledge gap that exists between them and the developers.    A fool with a tool is still a fool.  (Grady Booch)

      I have been accepted in  urlLink MSc Dependable Computer Systems  program offered by  urlLink Chalmers University of Technology ,  urlLink Sweden . It's a 1.5 years program and I'll be leaving for  urlLink Goteborg  near 17th of August, Insha Allah. Till then, I am trying to close all open threads and do some preparation for which I have taken a break after almost 4 years of continuous work!    [As a side note, the program consists of courses like Fault Tolerance, Redundancy, Concurrency and Cryptography amongst others. The whole idea is to make computers more dependable. Another very interesting field of study could be  urlLink Ubiquitous Computing , where the idea is to make computers adaptable to human beings rather than requiring human beings to learn using computers - it's somewhat opposite to Virtual Reality.]    Sweden, being a welfare state, offers free education at all levels, even to foreign students. However, the country's economy isn't as strong as that of Germany or France. Adding the fact that the native language is Swedish, one can conclude that after getting the degree, the odds are against getting a job. Moreover, an MS degree doesn't directly contribute to your career growth in Pakistan. In fact, doing an MBA from a local school might pay off more.    In parallel, I had applied for admission to the  urlLink MS program of LUMS . I did get through and had even paid the first semester fee (which I couldn't get refunded because of my extremely busy schedule). The academic as well as administrative difference between LUMS and Chalmers University of Technology is a big one. I started my admission process with LUMS in January this year and it's still not finalized (for example, I have not been told what courses will be offered and what would be my study plan). At every step, from waiting for the result of LGAT to paying the fee, LUMS has made me sweat. Chalmers, on the other hand, has not even asked for a single penny; has responded to my queries on email promptly; has posted the complete course plan on the web-site with credit hours, course outline and recommended reading [however, the process of getting visa was very tiring].     If constrained to Pakistan, LUMS is a very obvious choice - the MBA and BSc programs are producing excellent graduates. While it's the best institute in Pakistan for learning Management and Administration, it's very unfortunate to see the way LUMS handles admissions. And perhaps  urlLink this one is a currently enrolled student complaining about LUMS.     It needs just one person to change everything! Just one person!

      A few weeks back I received a telephone call from a distant relative, asking my opinion about a short computer course that he wanted to do during the vacations after SSC exams. I was a bit tired after a hectic day; anyways, I told him to go for it but he further enquired, "the course can be followed by a 6 years diploma in software development. Should I opt for it?" "What! How many years?" was my response. "Six," came the reply. Then, I had to tell him what possible options were at his disposal; how much he could get out of life if he started working hard at the right age; the subjects he could take at college level; the various other careers he could pursuit; the comparison of good institutes of Karachi with average and poor ones; etc. A simple telephone call turned into a complete career counselling service.  When I was a student,  urlLink Wasif Kazmi  (then in  urlLink Wavetech ) visited FAST and during his talk he asked how many of us would like to start our own software houses. Many hands got raised. His next question was, "Will it be  urlLink proprietary, partnership or public limited ?" And no one in the hall, including me, knew what the difference was. [Amongst the years, I have only come to know that it's all about liability.]  I sympathize with students who don't have access to accurate information. But students are also to be blamed for creating a hype out of everything and not doing good in what's assigned to them -  the studies .  A year down the road,  urlLink Netpace  organized an  urlLink Application Service Provider  (ASP) competition (they were getting very popular back then) amongst students of various institutes. The best students from my batch didn't want to participate. When I tried forming a team, they showed lack of interest and the reason I was told was a clause in the competition rules: "Netpace Inc. will hold all rights to the source code." I was surprised at both the clause and the way students were interpreting it. My only argument in favor of the competition was, "Have you ever written anything that you would like to protect the way you are protecting the code you will write for this competition?" The answer was in negative.  And the topic of students and IT reminds me of another incident. After graduation I joined CresSoft and usually had plenty of time at my disposal. I was once browsing through books at a local book shop when a middle-aged man interrupted and we had the following conversation:  The man:  Could you please suggest me some good book on EJBs?  Me:  I don't code EJBs and know little about them; You better look for a Wrox title...they are invariably good; I hope you know Java and JSPs.  The man:  Yes, I have undertook one course from  urlLink Operation Badar ...I am a doctor by profession. [I was surprised why this man is bent on changing his career in the middle of his life.] I hope there are good jobs in the market once I do EJBs with Java.   And I was afraid of telling him the reality. I still think how many others are doing short courses as if they were short cuts to getting rich.  To my dear young, aspiring friends, I would urge you to concentrate on your studies. Also, each one of you is unique in one way or another; identify that uniqueness; in almost all the cases, it's that unqiueness that will help you most in your career (it can be a pleasant personality; the ability to communicate well; ability to handle pressure; being smart enough to find simple solutions to complex problems; the ability to work continuously without break for many hours and so on). And the most important thing is to work smart and seek perfection in what you have been  assigned to do  (as compared to the usual trend of seeking perfection in only what interests us).    Don't seek guidance from just anyone out there. Find and be friends with someone who has already built up a reputation in your field and then treasure your acquaintance with that person.  There is only one real sin in your career: sitting idle .    Pleased to beat you!  (a Nike store in City Center, Doha)

      The last week was very hectic. I had to visit Islamabad to get visa stamped on my passport. Meanwhile, Salman Kasbati (FASTian 2000 - now in  urlLink Connect2Web ) took leave for the first week of August from his office. This meant that our three years old plan for going on a Pakistan tour might get materialized. With little effort, two more friends Humair Mudassir (FASTian 99 - now in  urlLink DreamzNet ) and Sarfaraz Ahmed (FASTian 2000 - now in  urlLink ITIM ) also got ready.  We bought a map of NWFP and listed down all the constraints. The major ones were being in Islamabad on 2nd of August and in Lahore on a working day. All of us had very important tasks to be done on 9th of August. The plan was made while sitting on a roadside lawn outside a house near National Stadium. We had the map stretched on the footpath with papers and pencils in our hands - busy in calculating expenses. No wonder every passerby gave us weird looks.  We selected Kaghan-Naran valley for our trip while passing by Lahore and staying in Islamabad for a day or two. The rest of the adventure would be interesting only for people who intend to go on a similar trip -  and would like to save costs . I'd write that only if I get time, which I never seem to have enough. Why can't I have more than 24 hours in a day?   The Waiter (in a restaurant in Naran):  Sir, aap ka naam kya hai?  Humair:  Bashir  The Waiter (turning towards Kasbati):  Aur sir, aap ka?  Kasbati:  Bashir  The Waiter (slightly distrubed):  Dono kaa aik hi naam hai?  ShahG:   Yeh dono asal main aik hi admi hain!  Kasbti:  Naheen, mera naam Bashir hai, us ka naam "Bashir underscore A" hai.  The Waiter:  Underscore?  (One of the several weird conversations we had on this trip)
