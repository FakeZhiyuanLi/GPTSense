      Today I just got back from Odessa.  Why, you ask, would anyone ever go there of their own free will?  It's because my friends, who are also luvahs, moved there.  I'm like, "Couldn't you have picked someplace nicer to live?"  Seriously.  The apartment they live in is extremely nice, though, and any place that size with the kind of furnishings that they have would cost a fortune in a city.  Besides, they could never move very far away from west texas because they have a freakin' ton of glass.  And I literally mean ton.  La verdad.  Holy Mother, I'm bored.  There is nothing to do here and I don't have any friends.  I was going to go and visit my friend David, but he said that I couldn't.  He's such an ass.  He's like, "Come see the show I'm in!" and I'm finally like, "Alright."  Then he's like, "Nevermind."  Wow.  I just realized how Valley it is to sit here and narrate a conversation, especially using the word "like" as much as I just did.  I guess that just proves how much of a fag I am.  *sigh*  This is a really boring post.  Not that anyone is reading this ever, because I'm sure that no one is.  Which is fine.  This is more for me than it is for you, anyway!  So there!  I fucking hate you anyway.

      I love alcohol.  But seriously.  It is super tasty and the effects are even better than the taste.  Ah.  The dulling of pain and thinking is fantastic.  Actually, I'm not all that dull after drinking.  I find myself to delve more into myself and pull out deep and fantastic thoughts.  Most people do that when they're high, I think, but not me.  No.  I choose alcohol as my drug of choice.  I hear it's not very good for the liver, though.  I do not have much to report today.  Not that anyone at all is reading this, because I'm sure that no one is.  But for my own benefit, I'll replay the day.  Nothing happened.  The end.  Well, except that I got highlights in my hair.  I thought that the hairdresser would do them all over, but they are mostly in the very front of my head.  It looks OK, though, so no complaints.  I like Ricky, so it's all good.  I was hoping to make myself more attractive, but I don't think that I have accomplished such a feat.  Instead, perhaps I will just draw more attention, and therefore, more aversion to my horrid face.  Horrible!  Horrible!  *aghhk* Horrible!   That last thing was from a movie.  It's one of my favorites.  Superstar.  Yes, yes, I'm sure that most of you can't even begin to watch a movie like that.  It's friends like David Lee Malone, however, that introduce me to movies like this.  Super funny to me.  Yes, my humour actually is very wide in scope.  I can appreciate many kinds of physical, witty, dry, and bitchy humours.  That is what makes me so fantastic.  Not that I'm fantastic to everyone, mind you, but I enjoy being around myself, that's for sure.  Ok, you hate me now.  Have a lovely day.  Sorry this was a drunk blog.  Buhr.

      It's a little late, but I'm bored so I thought that I would post something here.  Why did I just drink a coke?  I knew that I wouldn't feel good after doing it, but I did it anyway.  I'm such a loser.  Like I needed those extra calories.  I mean, really.  Do I WANT to weigh as much as a blue whale by the time I'm 26?  Not really.  However, I seem to have no will power.  I cannot tell myself "no" very often, if at all.  This is one of my huge faults.  I'm not exactly sure how to overcome it.  Perhaps I should just pay someone to make me do things.  Like some guy that is really attractive.  I would totally do whatever he said if he were hot enough.  As long as he had a good attitude.  Rarely do you find someone that is very attractive that also has a good personality.  I'm serious.  Hot people get whatever they want constantly, so they're very bitchy to ugly people like me and they're also very full of themselves.  It's extremely unattractive no matter how hot someone is on the outside.  If they are nice, however, and ignorant of how their hotness affects other people, then they're doubly attractive.  Those are the kinds of people that I just can't be around.  I've really only met two guys like that, though.  And you can really create a crush with people like that in record time.  I mean, I'm surprised if someone attractive just talks to me.  I'm sure that hiring someone really attractive would be very expensive, though.  An ugly person would be less, I'm sure.  But I would be less inclined to listen to them if they told me to get my ass moving.  If only I could find a really hot blind gay guy that didn't mind fatties.  I would listen to him and he would love me because he didn't know what I looked like.  I'd be very productive and probably successful if I had support like that.  But that'd be rather shallow of me to ask for something like that, wouldn't it?  Here I am accusing hot people of being bitchy, but at the same time I'm saying that I'd be more inclined to do something with my life if I had a hot, caring boyfriend.  I don't really need that, of course, but it's fun to think about.  I would actually prefer a really dorky boyfriend who was semi-cute (because I'd most likely think they were the cutest thing in the world) and that actually had feelings for me.  Gay guys are totally not like that, though.  That's why I'll settle for paying someone attractive to make me exercise and practice.  Thing is, I'd have to motivate myself to make the money to pay the person, and that's just not going to happen...

      That's right.  This is my first posting on this website.  I'm bored, I have no life, so I thought, "Hell, why not write about nothing?"  I know that Seinfeld has already done the thing about nothing, but I think that my version will be so completely different, no one will be the wiser.  Espeically not any of the people who are bound to read it.  You've probably already forgotten the last sentence.  If you are fluent in Spanish, like I am, you will notice that the title of my blog is "Yo quiero morir."  For those of you who are not fortunate enough to be as amazingly gifted in Spanish as I, it loosely translates as "I want to die."  Actually... that's the definitive translation.   I really don't want to die.  At least, not for an extended period of time.  And I want my death to be very pleasant.  None of this extreme or lengthy pain.  That's just really not for me.  A quick, painless death.  You know, like a lobster thrown in boiling water.  Mmmm... lobster.  I love lobster.  With butter.  Yes, you were quite right my friend, we must go to Maine.   Because this is my first posting, I will give a slight and very brief background of myself.  I don't think that anyone who doesn't know me will be reading this, but one can never tell.  Be prepared, I say.  That totally reminds me of the Lion King.  Anyway, as I was saying, I'm a 25 year old (soon to be 26 year old) white male.  I'm a fag, I'm a flutist, and I'm fat.  The alliteration really worked.  Too bad I don't know if I spelled that literary tool correctly.  I'm a very boring sort of person, but I can be relatively amusing to be around.  For example, I enjoy alcohol.  Everybody loves a subtle alcoholic.  I was also well trained by my friends to become somewhat of a bitch.  But a good bitch.  I never use my powers for evil.  In fact, when confonted by evil, I rarely choose to confront or engage in battle with it.  It's not that I'm always scared, though that could be the case, but I often find myself grasping for the emotion which would cause me to care.  Emotions in general are difficult for me to produce or sustain for any amount of time.  Except for love of food and alcohol.  My heart was ripped out ages ago by a ravenous, psychotic beaver.  Steer clear of those is my suggestion.  Unless you no longer wish to feel, or be ambitious, or be productive.  If that's the case, I suggest you head to the nearest body of water.  There should be at least one beaver who's ravenous and psychotic enough to tear your heart out.  If not, just tell them how much their dam sucks and then step on their tail.  They hate that.
