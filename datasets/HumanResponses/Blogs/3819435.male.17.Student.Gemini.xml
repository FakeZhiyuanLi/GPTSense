So anyway, tomorrow I take off for Las Vegas! Wa hoo! I'll pick up some cheap and tacky souvenirs  for y'all! I'll be back by Tuesday. See ya then! Lumps of Love!

      Oh wow.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so friggin' tired right now. Let's see, what has happened lately? All the performances went very well. The cast party was very fun. After that, we all went over to Craig's for an after-party.&nbsp;I was upset to see Nikki there but, hey, I couldn't ask her to leave. It is Craig's house, after all. I don't remember all that much about the after-party. I think I was doing figure-eights in and out of reality.&nbsp; I remember waking up next to Relissa with my shirt off. I asked her what happened and she said "Nothing", so I assumed that I hadn't raped her or anything.&nbsp;The next thing that I remember, I was watching Ben and Chase play DDR and Samantha was lying next to me. I zonked out again (I think). The next time I came around, it was about 4:30 and I was lying on the couch alone (for the first time all night).&nbsp;I decided that I should probably drive home because I had to work at 11. I made it home alright, crashed, got up, showered, went to work, played a round of golf at the "Sears Family Picnic", went over to my grandma's house for supper, came home, and crashed yet again.&nbsp;I'm still tired and I slept until about 3:30 today. I'll be home all day tomorrow (Tuesday) so if you're bored, give me a ring @ 339-3110. Nighty night! Lumps of love!

       Hello Everybody!&nbsp; Today was a looooong day. First, we had rehearsal from 1-4:30ish.&nbsp; Practice went along without a hitch.&nbsp; Then, I was trying to drive home so that I could shower and grab some black socks, but my car ran out of gas at the corner of Marion and 26th (right in front of HyVee).&nbsp; Good thing I have AAA, huh?&nbsp; It was then time for the parent production of  Get Smart .&nbsp; That went really well.&nbsp; I got a lot of laughs, which is a good thing.&nbsp; Well, good night.&nbsp; Take care of yourselves and others.&nbsp; Lots of love!

      Howdy do!  Today was quite an interesting day. I had to work from 10-2. After I got off (of work, I mean), I had play practice. We finished at about 6:30. Then Matt and I were going to go to Wild Water West to celebrate Sam's birthday party but we didn't get there until about 7:30 and the waterpark closed at 8. Oh well...sorry Sam, we tried. Instead of going swimming, Matt and I went to his house and played Monopoly. I had fun. I think I'm gonna go to crew call tomorrow if I wake up in time. Talk to ya later!

      **Today, Dugan will be posting in Third Person**  Aaron says, "Welcome back dear friends and hated rivals!" Today, Aaron woke up at about 8-ish, took a 30 minutes shower, then left for Crew Call. When Aaron arrived at the auditorium, he was immediately put to work by Mr. Hanzen. Whistling while he worked, Aaron helped his good friend Matt Fejfar build the trap-door in the stage. After this task was completed, Mr. Hanzen asked Aaron to help him move large wooden constructions into the new addition. Following Crew Call, Aaron and his fellow cast members ran through the entire show twice. Aaron was asked to dye his hair black for his role as Willy Willy Wong. It was then time for everyone to go their seperate ways for the night, so Aaron called his dad and was picked up at about 5:45 PM. Aaron and his father then came home, grilled steaks, and watched South Park. All in all, it was a fairly good day for Aaron. "Good night!", moans Aaron as he finishes updating his Blog.

      Hello,  What do I have to say that's not completely stupid or pointless? I could tell you about my semi-boring day. Yeah...that sounds good to me. 'Kay, here we go: I went to play practice, flirted with some people, got licked by Fejfar, etc. I had something important to say, but I lost it. I'll post again later tonight if I remember what it was. Bye for now.

      Happy Fourth of July everyone! Enjoy your festivities and food. I probably should help Geoff launch his fireworks tonight, but somehow I'm not in the mood for hanging out with friends. Maybe I'll feel more festive later tonight (?). By the way, Craig: I hope you found your keys. My understanding is that you'll all be out at Steph Degelau's old house tonight.  Maybe I'll see you tonight, maybe not. Byes for now!  Dugan

      Welcome Friends,  My name is "Dugan", a.k.a. Aaron Hopkins, and I'm here to save the world from Communist bastards! Here, on this Web-Log, I shall recount the significant events of my day (perhaps in Third Person). Also, in my writing, I will capitalize random words. Do not try to comprehend the reason. There is none to comprehend. I will try my Damndest to update everyday (but s*** happens, ya know?). Okay, once again: Welcome to the Dugan Domain. Farewell!

      My number is 212-6094. This post is to help me with a particular friend of mine who seems to be upset with me at the moment. I won't mention the name, but you know who you are. (If you don't, leave a comment and I shall answer questions.) Anyway, this friend of mine seems to be mad at me for something I did last month (July). This action of mine was not my choice, I was scheduled to work even though I requested it off. Where I work, you don't always get what you want. That's one of the joys of working for a corporate business. So, my friend, don't be mad at me. If you need to blame someone, blame Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., okay? Can't we just be friends again? Please? There, I've apologized and made a full reckoning of my sins, so don't hate me anymore. Nighty night!

       I have a new phone now.  Yay!  It is a camera phone, too, so most likely I will be seeking your picture soon.  Why, you ask?  Well, then I can program it where whenever you call me, your happy picture will pop up and then I will push the ignore button.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.  *chuckle*  Anyhoo, the days to Honor's Choir dwindle down and I get more and more excited.  I can't wait to wear my dress for all to see!  *skips*  Oh, and singing too.  Yeah.  Haha.  I also can't wait to feel the power of singing in an amazing choir.  It has been a while since I have done that.  Today I got a haircut and I have bangs now!  Exciting, eh?  I think so.  They're not creepy uniform bangs though.  I like them and I think you will too.  At least, you will if you ever want me to talk to you again.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.

       So school is coming soon and we have no choice but to go back. Not that we wouldn't want to eventually go back, but that if it could be prolonged, I'm sure we all would gladly push it back. This school year isn't going to be bad or anything. It is just going to be very stressful, but at the same time  so much fun!  Parts of me will miss this past year. Being a junior was the most fun I've had... ever. So then, I guess we can assume that senior year will be all the better. Between Concert Choir, Show Choir, San Francisco, and Drama, not to mention all the numerous random fun activities there will be throughout the year, I don't think I have to worry about not having enough fun with all of you crazy fun people. So until the next post.   {Geoffrey}

       Yes, that is what I shall be. The Keeper of the Keys. *holds them high for everyone to see* INDEED. I decided that I like this blog because it let's me be ponderish, one of my favorite things to be, and then I get to see what people think without clicking on the comments button. Let's toast to that.   This is for my Katie: Will you be my warmie? *cheesy smile*   To everyone: Hey, I dare you to move.  Why is it that we spend so much time in&nbsp;a hurry to grow up but then when we finally get there we wish we could be young again? Is it because we wear diapers when we're small but once again when we're wrinkly? Why is it that I sit here, finally looking at my senior pictures, wondering where my life went? It seems as if these last few years have been on a&nbsp;slight fast forward and now it's only going to get faster. I wanted so badly to grow up, but now I find that I'm just a little bit scared to grow up the rest of the way. I hate to bring this up once again, but I find that it crosses my mind quite a bit lately, and I suppose I can't be the only one. I have officially finished my first senior thing and now I think I'm ready. I'm ready to actually classify myself as a senior. Indeed. Louisa Mae Soli-Holt&nbsp; has proclaimed herself a senior, one year away from starting her first year of college. I think I can handle that. I hope I can anyway. =)  This being the end of this post, good byes are in order. Look for a long survey on my blog...  urlLink www.jiggymae.blogspot.com  ...in the near future. Come to Coldstone on Thursday night and see me all dressed up. Smile a lot because it'll get you through the hard stuff and accentuate the best stuff. Remember that I love you. Because I do. Okay? Okay. =)  **Louisa**

       Wow, Chase, that's a very interesting question. It sounds fairly logical to me but, somehow, it doesn't. I think it mainly depends on the persons' attitude. I dhunno, really. I guess my answer is False. Good question! Bye!

         I think that the statement may be true and false at the same time.&nbsp; I agree for the most part with what Sean said.&nbsp; It's understandable that a person may be quiet around their friends and talkative with their loved one because the reason they are that person's loved one is because they feel they can be the most open and comfortable with them.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; But, as Sean so eloquently stated, it depends on the situation and who is around.&nbsp; Bottom line, sometimes people to crazy things and are entirely unpredictable and not able to be&nbsp;summed up in&nbsp;one sentence.&nbsp; So... Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is my quite possibly indecipherable standpoint.&nbsp;    --Ashley M. Ludewig--

       Well, in response to Katie's question: yes katie, I think it should be by the half&nbsp;year now. Because you have reached the point where a month is such a small percentage of your total relationship time. Plus, I don't like hearing about it  every single month . I am happy for you, but I think it may be a little more special if it is by the half year. Then, I will be able to say, "Wow, it's been a year and a half already? My, how time flies."   Done with that topic. Now to Chase's question: The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover.&nbsp; True or False?  Well, I agree, but then I don't. I believe that they act differently tho their loved one, but not necessarily all the time. Let's say a person is with  only  their loved one. Then, I agree with you. They will act kinder and sweeter and gentler. But, if the person is with their loved one  and  someone else is around too, they will act totally different. I dont' know if it is to impress their friend, but they say things and may even be cruel to their "loved one." Now, for some people it is the same when friend are around, but that is because they are not afraid to let their friends know how they feel or act towards their "loved one." I hope you understood. That is my experience in these things.

       I really think clowns are stupid.&nbsp; To many colors all at once with those damn white faces!&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I really have never thought of them as creepy either... except Bozo the clown... he was kinda creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway...  New topic of discussion... a little deeper... a bit of philosophy.    The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality.&nbsp; If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover. &nbsp;   True or False?

       Well, I would have to say that clowns are&nbsp;funny and scary at the same time. I remember going to the circus and seeing clowns and going to the bathroom and crying the whole time I was at the circus.&nbsp; But, now, they don't bother me. In fact, my church has a group called "The Clowns of St. John." Basically, they go around to the hospitals and visit sick kids. So, in that perspective, clowns are good. But, who knows? Maybe it's just some big cover-up?

       No joking! I am scared to death of clowns. I went to a psychiatrist about it one time and he said that I have Coulrophobia, or the fear of clowns. I don't know why, but they have always frightened me.&nbsp;I think it's because they are constantly happy. No human I know is constantly happy so, therefore, I do not classify clowns as human. That's all I have to say about that. Farewell!

        True, true. Clowns and their habits are creepy, but who says you can't have fun with that? I mean, come on. Nikki Willhoit is creepy, yet we have fun with... I'm done. I personally don't have anything against clowns. Well... mostly. The one in "IT" is still a bit scary, but that's just because I was traumatized. The way I see it is that if it's creepy, poke it. Then, based upon its reaction, do it again, and again, and again. Then it'll just cry a lot. There, now it's not creepy anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; :P  &nbsp;   {Geoffrey}

       It honestly depends on the situation, but seeing as how they are usually played by toothless carnies trying to screw with little kids' minds I say they are creepy.&nbsp; Maybe not to the little kids, but to me they are.&nbsp; Plus there's almost never a girl clown so it's always just a bunch of guys doing stupid and sometimes randy things to one another.&nbsp; ... but that's just me.  --Ashley M.

       So this is a "Life in General" post. That means it is about life in general. This is about us. Our little pod. You know the one I'm talking about. The one that has existed for quite some time... or rather feels as such. Basically everyone on this blog plus a few others is what makes up a group of friends that will surely last for a lifetime. Sure there have been some who've been added more recently than others, and some that have faded away, but for the most part, it has remained steadily intact. In the days, weeks, months, and even years, we'll have to rely on our group of friends. Some of us will get really depressed and as a result the others will have to hold on tight and keep on being friends until the happiness comes back. Then at other times, we'll be in moments of pure happiness and ebullience for joy. I am glad to know that I have you all to support me. I appreciate the friendship and shared joy... and sorrow for that matter. I love our inside jokes and querks.  Katie: I love you all around. You give me happiness that words cannot describe. I couldn't have lived my life without you... at least the way I like it.  Sean: You have a way of making me laugh like no one else. You and I can also talk about the world like no other. This will never end. Craig: I appreciate you like I appreciate a day of perfect weather. You and I can find the beauty in things that could be destructive. Our common interests give us a viewpoint that is unique. Ashley: Our past together, though turbulent, is important. Our common background allows for us to bond in a way that only friends like us can. I'm glad we like eachother now. Aaron: You and I come from the same origins. We used to be strangest, most hyper-active kids around. Well... we still kind of are. This commonality gives us a great friendship... though slightly odd, still great. Jacob: In a way, I envy you. Your new start, and your ability to make new friends seems like an opportunity I used to long for. However, you have taught me to appreciate what I have and to always look at the good in life: a.k.a. Katie. Chase: You, Sean, and I started it off. The group of three crazy guys that became a group of great friends. You will always be one of  the  guys. Kyle: As a new member to the group, you haven't had the opportunity to fully experience what Sean and I like to call "The C-wingers." I can't wait to bring you into the group. You are always welcome. Louisa: You and I have had our disagreements, but after some time, we always go back to the laugh-happy friends we have been. Thanks for hating me then, tolerating me a while ago, and loving me now. You are great! I love you all. You are my family. (Sean's the grandma!) Love, Geoffrey W. Nixon

       Yes, that's right, I'm back. I don't care if you are glad about it or not, I'm back and I'm happy to be back. There's something exhilirating about leaving for a period of time, but there's something even better about coming back.  Honor Choir was super and I wish I could go back. The people you meet there are unlike any others. They are one in a million, I'll tell you what. I just hope we don't lose touch.  Wisconsin with Stephanie D. was awesome. I had the best time. Her mother and she surprised me and took me to a Twins game the first full day I was there. Those of you that know me well, know that I love baseball, so that was quite a treat. So was the bat/water boy...mmm...tasty. =)Yes, well, we did all sorts of fun things to make for an absolutely great time all around.  I did some clothes shopping for school and was quite happy to make my purchases. It's always fun, is it not?  Let's see, I guess we are supposed to discuss things and pose questions of interest on this bloggie-o, so hmm...*ponders* What classes are you all looking foward to as we begin this senior year (well, those of us here that are seniors)? I hope you aren't dreading it, because as soon as this year begins, it'll be over. Perhaps that is worth dreading. It all being over. But no. It'll be great. Just you wait.  **Louisa**

       Just wanted to let you blokes and lassies know that my party on the 28th is set in stone. I think if you all show up any time after 7:30 or 8:00 that will be grand and the females are welcome to stay the night while the males will be asked to leave about 1 most likely.  DIRECTIONS: Make your way to Rice St., whether it is by taking 229 and getting off at the Rice exit, taking 12th St. to Cliff and Cliff to Rice, or 12th to Cleveland and Cleveland to Rice. Take Rice east for a long, long time until you reach the stoplight at the corner of Rice and Sioux in Brandon. Take a right (south) onto Sioux... follow it for a while, 6 or 7 blocks (I can't remember which) past the cemetary you will see a street marked Chapelwood. Take a right (west) onto Chapelwood and go to the end of the first block where you will find, on the left (south) side of the street a blue two-story house on the corner numbered 209. That is my place of residence.  Additionally, feel free to bring any snacks and/or soda you wish. We will have some food here but I have a feeling the rents won't want to fork over a lot of dough for party supplies. Also, if you have movies you'd like to watch bring them, however we don't have a DVD player hooked up in the basement so they have to be VHS.  I look forward to seeing you all soon.  --Ashley M. Ludewig--  P.S. Girls who wish to stay would be well advised to bring some sort of blanket and pillow because we have a few extra but not a TON and if a lot of you want to stay (which would be awesome and you are more than welcome) we will run out of blankets and some of us will freeze and be pillowless.

       I seriously don't know if I am a band-o or not. I hope not. Anyway, Geoffrey, I'd like to go to Lifelight with you and Sean if that's okay. I've never been there before and I think I'd enjoy it. By the way, I am really sunburned and sore. If you didn't know already, I play the tuba in marching band and it is really heavy but i'm getting used to it. Okay. Bye for now.
