      ........but i'm getting ahead of myself,Soon after the twin kittens arived,Specky,as he was now called,went to the docter to become fixed,but Sahara,for some bizarre reason was not,thus in a few months after her first birthday,Sahara became with kittens,over the next couple of years,Shara had given birth or had been grandmother to  20 cats,all abiding to her,her empire of kittens,these are the kittens names,well,the names of the ones that were not given away,Daniel,Shanti-town,Princess,Scruffy-Midnight,Demon,White Diamond,Nubia,Snow shoe,Dunkens,Apollo,Sike,Pumperneilia,Shmoofy,Emperor Penguin,Cleopatra,Bella,Bello and finally Malice.           Now,in a matter of two years,Francheska had her army of cats,She was ready to strike.That night, Tessy lay sleeping in her mat,unaware of the horrors that would come that night......to be continued.......

      ....well,days then months then years passed and francheska's plan grew more evil and more elaborate,but then,something happened right before her plan was to begin,two new cats entered the family,twins,Specularo and Sahara,they were black and white,with smooth,glossy fur,Specularo was the male,he was cuddly,fun loving and most importantly,he loved tessy,they soon became fast freinds.........................  .................................................but Sahara,like francheska,hated tessy,and felt alone and unloved,so,naturally,francheska and Sahara formed an alience,that alience would lead to the battle to end all battles,and an empire would be built throught Sahara and Francheska,but who could guess?............................................................back then.........to be continued.........

      .....There was alot that would never be known and alot that was said but never happened but what was heard through the whispers of the 8 cats was a story,a story stretching back to the time before the blue haired boy's birth,it all started with Francheska,Francheska was just a kitten when she was given to the boy's mother,she had emerald green eyes and golden brown tabby strpes down her back,she was beautiful,and she was the only cat,the baby of the family,when the boy was born he ofcoarse,did not have blue hair,it was brown,like so maney other babies,by all acounts,he was a very very normal,cute baby,all attention went on him,he almost demanded it,as most babies do,and Francheska felt replaced and disliked,when the baby grew to be a boy,he was most certainly not a normal boy,nor did he want to be normal,he drew on the walls and wrote poetry,he hated all sports,Francheska felt sad for the boy,for he had no freinds then,she would cuddle with him,he was her boy now.............well,time passed and the family moved to a new,bigger house where the boy could paint giant pictures on the walls and have his own,huge room,it was then when he started to ask for blue hair,not yet,they said,he was too young,when Francheska came to the new house,there was somone else,a grey tabby ktten,she had bright golden eyes,she was really playful dispite the cast on her leg from an acident her name was tessy,and the boy instantly fell in love with her,the would snuggle together every night,and Francheska was welcome to come as well,but Francheska grew bitter towards the kitten and fromulated a plan to stop that ktten and get her out of HER house............to be continued......

      The blue haired boy was sad to look at the crying cat,she was a sorry looking creature,white and grey lines covered her old,decrepet body,the white in her coat was stained with red dirt and oil paint from the boy's art set,she had peircing yellow-brown eyes,almost as if her once bright golden eyes had been stained with dirt and dulled by salty-acid tears she was handy caped at bieth from a road acident,leaving her with a limp,this alienated her from the other,feirce,jet black cats and the soft,gentle,powder white kittens she took care of while their mothers were off mating and taking cat nip,the grey cat had allways loved the boy,but there was no amount of snuggling could tare the pain from the grey cat's heart...what had happened to her?......to be continued.....
