      After such a long while, finally I am back... Its been a busy week for me... Trying to cope up with the projects and assignments coming along the way... Have lots of work... Finally able to take a break for today, however, starting from tomorrow, another busy day and week ahead... Projects piling up again, and more assignments... Never ending... Who say poly slack, worst than ever...  Reflecting about the whole week, wednesday, went for this thai band concert at the esplanade... The deepest inpression this week... The horn tone, totally blown the whole audience... It was really amazing... Hearing that will feel goosebumps... Can't imagine if Shuqun have such godness playing, WOW... The trombone, was also heart-melting... Being a trombonist, can't imagine how the players can get to run with pedal notes... Double WOW... The tone was also heart-melting... The whole concert was totally enjoyable... Really over-whelming... Hope to work hard and become one of them...  Anyway, that person irritate me again... Find being with him really irritates me... Really want to shoot him at the face... Yet, don't dare to do it... Hai...  Not like me anymore... Don't know how to handle him... Just take him... Will be the best for both of us... Train patients... Ha...ha...  Well, went back shuqun today... Teaching was fun... Well, improvements in the sec 1... Really felt great, especially the Yi Heng, a fast learner, with his hardwork, will become the next Diana... Hope to train him to become better... The Jerryl also not bad, just lazy... Well, work hards guys... The next year SYF will be a great... The achievement feeling will be overwhelming... Strive harder guys..  Well, next week will be another exciting week, next sat again...

      Well, even though not really a loyal Singaporean, well at least wish Singapore a belated national day... We are now 39th years old... There is still a long way to come...  Anyway, went to my aunt's house and have a celebration fest... The usual, mine favourite salad is on the table, can't get enough of it, almost want to ta bao back home... Ha...ha... From my aunt's house can see the fireworks very clearly, and also the national flag flying across... Most important of course is the airplane... Ha...ha... After all, her house near Katong... Ha...ha... Just not at the national stadium... Ha...ha... Lame Lame Lame...  Well, spend the whole day with my family... Not bad a celebration... Even though most of time we are playing mahjong... I don't have the interest liao, so stick to the tv, and the bunch of lousy cousins... Ha...ha...  Erm... Went to the doc this morning, feel that I am not really improving... Instead getting worst... Don't know why... Hai~!!! Leave to fate...

      Hai~!!! How should I say... I have trust that person too much... Really don't want to patch up, yet I did it for that person because I believe him... However, my heart really don't want... Just feel very confused... And feel myself very stupid and naive for trusting others whereas trusting myself who I really feel that it is right...  Should I trust him back again? He has hurt me even more deeply than my ex... Yet, I am not sure... Don't bother anymore... Just know once bitten twice shy... Believe in yourself as you know what you really one... Must remember!!! Important rule...  Anyway, enjoy myself today... Went to arcarde and play till siao... Waste lots of $$$ today... Ha...ha... Well, at least not so sorrowful as yesterday... Look to the brighter side of things... Plus, beings single is great... Been through before lots of times... Ha...ha... Don't worry ok... No More Pestering... As per promise... Ha...ha... Be friends... The best for both of us...

      A newbie here creating my own blog... I find that everyone is doing it... Therefore got influenced, and did it... Ha...ha... Therefore, maybe I can post whatever I want over here...  Well, got a double K.O. The Xuanming Shen Zhang too powerful... Really hit me twice as hard... Should be K.O. to the power of 3... I did my test badly today... Trying to concentrate, yet I could not do it... Find it too tough... Thinking about yesterday... May seem to get over it... Yet the hit was too powerful... Putting up a brave front infront of everyone... Yet, still deeply hurt by yesterday... How should I say... I still miss "him"...  The truth is, experience really cannot count... I have been through lots of time, but this time, really hurt badly... I really want to save it... Yet, it cannot be done... And yet, I don't know why...  Maybe fate has really want us to be this way... It is almost one year... Yet I ultimately spoil it... What a wonderful me... And because of this, I disappointed everyone... Including the ones closest to me...  My bro just feel that I am not myself... Yet he still gave me encouragement to pull through... However, he feel that I did a choice that is hurtful to both side... Hai~!!! A cause of all problem... I HATE MYSELF... And I knew it by heart... Just too hurtful... Hai~!!!!
