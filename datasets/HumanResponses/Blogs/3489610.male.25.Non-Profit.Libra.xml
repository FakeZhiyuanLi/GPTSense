Please answer the questions below as openly as you can.  Feel free to use point form if you so desire, I am not judging anything other than your opinion on the issue of Long Distance Relationships.

General Questions

Are you currently involved in a relationship?
 
No

How long have you been/were you involved in the relationship? 
 
5 years

What are your thoughts on Long Distance Relationships (LDR), whether involved in one or not?
 
LDRs involve a lot of mutual care and attention. For it to work both parties should be prepared to devote their full trust (on each other), time, as well as resources (because both parties will have to find creative (and perhaps expensive) ways to always let each other know how they’re doing and that they’re there for each other. 

The general consensus states LDRs are hard to manage.  What do you feel makes fulfilling LDRs difficult? 
 
In a gay relationship, I think what makes LDRs difficult is the physical part. Sex is of course a component of intimacy but since distance is involved, intimacy—which is a vital ingredient to any relationship, would be lessened.

Does "absence really make the heart grow fonder"? 
 
In some ways yes, but the absence should not be for long. I’d rather think of absence as means to strengthen (the trust in) the relationship but not to kill it. LDRs therefore should be a phase towards a more permanent “non-LDR” type of relationship.

Do you believe that being involved in a same-sex LDRs is more difficult than a heterosexual one? Why or why not. 
 
Yes, as I have mentioned a while ago, I think that physicality (be it sex, intimacy, or plain being physically there for each other) is crucial to a (male) homosexual relationship. I would like to stress this with male homosexual relationships because I believe gay females or lesbians have a better handle at LDRs than gay males. I think that women are (or are “trained” to be) more patient than men are/were.
For those with experience in Long Distance Relationships:


How long did the "distance" last or how long has it been going on?
 
It lasted for 5 years.

Did you discuss an approach to the LDR before the distance started?  
	What does this approach entail?
 
No, not really but it was a bumpy ride so to speak, like an emotional roller coaster ride. Communication was/is crucial but still was/isn’t enough—because there are things that you can communicate with words and there are things that you can only convey with just a touch or a glance.

How do you 'deal' with being in LDR?
 
Like I said, lots of communication—email, phonecalls, snail mail.

How do you feel Jealousy, Insecurity, Trust and Commitment factor into LDRs?
 
Like I said, communication is key, and of course, trust. Both parties should be aware of the temptations and they should both trust themselves and each other that no matter what happens, the other person is or will be there for him/her (otherwise, there’s no point in staying in the relationship. Or unless both parties are open to modifications were the relationship becomes an open relationship—both can play with others (example: for sex if and when it’s “needed” and the other person is absent).  

What are some positive elements that come from LDRs? 
 
If both parties are willing to stay, I think they’ll learn patience, trust, and they will be able to learn more about the other person. Because if they keep the communication going, they will be able to talk a lot and most likely, they will be able to strengthen the relationship in such a way that both are forced to “study” or experiment on ways to keep and stay in the relationship. But like I said, LDRs should be a phase, meaning only for a limited period of time.

What are some negative elements that come from LDRs? 
 
Without complete and honest communication, the distance can bring a lot of negatives into the relationship, such as jealousy, infidelity, etc. 

How often do you communicate with your significant, distant other?  What methods do you use to do so? 
 
I already mentioned them above.

Do you schedule times to see each other, how does this work?
 
There was really no schedule but he was usually the one following my time. But I give him calls, send him cards too.

How has the distance changed your relationship, or has it remained the same?
 
Like I said the distance should not be extended for a (very) long period.

Are fundamental elements of the relationship lost with distance?  Describe these elements please. 
 
I think I’ve already discussed all of them here.

Would you have embarked on the LDR knowing what you did after being in one?
 
I’m not sure. Maybe I would BUT only if it was a step towards a more permanent “non-LDR” kind.

What tips or advice can you offer to manage LDRs? 
 
Be prepared to spend lots of time, effort, and even money. Be patient to communicate effectively and efficiently. Remember that it’s a special relationship BECAUSE of the distance. Both parties must be willing to make it happen and so both should be prepared emotionally and physically.

What has the LDR taught you?
 
Patience (I think), trust, and effective (and efficient) communication. 

Are LDRs destined to fail? YES or NO:  
 
Not so much as destined to fail but perhaps LDRs are meant to endure a certain number of years. It can only go so far. Like I “proposed” it should be a phase or like a waiting period for a more concrete/stable and “normal” relationship.
