      Birds fly in loving pairs, Pups play with loving care, do you see those loving bears? even though i try with loving dare. But i fly a lonesome flight, and i play a lonely score, i dont see no loving bears, cuz i see no love in me, i set them loose n they all ran free, leaving loneliness to me, good old loneliness for me...  this poem reflects how i've been feelin for this few days, i may seem to smile, but the wound is too deep, the feeling is too strong, i decide a poem would be best to explain... its easy to understand really... so plz jus read it for me will ya??

      tommorow is near,  but reality is clear, oneness&nbsp;is many, loneliness is dreary, how parrellel r the lives we lead, it seems we'll nvr meet. how i long for the day, that paths will cross n oaths will cause, cuz&nbsp;how unforgiving it is,  the torment n the grief, that only loneliness brings...  mm... my mind's in a whirl, all sorta stuff r clashing..... guess i gotta eat n sleep, n all shld be fine =)
