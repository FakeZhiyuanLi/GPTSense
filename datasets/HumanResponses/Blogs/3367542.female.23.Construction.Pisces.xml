       I haven't had a chance to write in here for a while. I worked Friday night and called in sick yesterday. I was actually sick, for real. But I managed to drag myself to the Eurocan social club anual camp out. Three words that can describe that camping trip: cold, wet and boring. Wow, aren't I just so positive?!?  Anyhow.. I lost another 5 pounds. So I am 5 pounds lighter than I was when I first moved up North. I feel alot better and my clothes fit better as well. I no longer feel sausagy.    Ok I am not really in the mood for writing, as you can tell. I doubt anyone is reading this anyway. I write in here for my own benefit. Kind of like a journal you know??  At this very moment I am waiting for the shower. I stink like campfire smoke and look like I just jumped out of a Sally-Anne box. I would definately scare people that do not know me very well.  I haven't been feeling that well lately. I am not sure what is going on, could possibly be dehydrated. Note to self: Drink more damn water.  Abby did not come camping with us. I actually missed the little bitch. There was another dog camping that was also a cattle dog and a constant reminder of Abby.  I missed Kendall this weekend like you wouldn't believe. So I had to go out to the campsite to see him.  I have a feeling he will be getting some great news in the near future. Mark my words.       urlLink eskimo.jpg

       My older sister was adopted out when she was born. My parents had met in 1976. At that time my mom was 18 and pregnant. My father took care of my mother and respected her right to choose adoption.  My parents were quite open about it. From what I can recall, they told me when I was around 13. They have been open with the rest of my siblings. The matter sometimes gets brought up, especially during special occasions. My little sister was about 9 when she mentioned, "wow the whole family is here, except for Kimberley," while around the Christmas dinner table. I can't imagine how my mom feels. It must be really hard.  My older sister is something that I think about often. I find myself staring at women that remotely resemble myself, thinking, "wow is that her?"  There was this girl who started upgrading at my highschool in Powell River. She was about 5 years older than myself and everyone told us we looked alike. I brought up the fact that I was looking for my older sister and it just so happened she was adopted as well. But she totally ignored me after the conversation and it really made me wonder.  Apparently I have the option of registering myself at the Ministry of Children and Families. And if Kimberley has registered she has an option of meeting myself. I am a bit scared to do this. Simply because I realize how hurt she must be. If I was adopted out I would be hurt upon finding that my mother had 5 other children, is happily married, etc etc etc.  Kimberley will always have a special place in my heart. I hope she has lived a stable, successful, happy life.

       I have encountered quite an array of compliments in my short little lifetime. Not to sound conceited or anything. But every girl has I am sure.  Most compliments were just plots to get into my pants. And there was a few legitimate ones.  The best compliments I have ever received were from little old ladies. Little old ladies never lie right?? Not usually anyhow.   Many people have considered myself beautiful, but then again we all have different versions of ugly right? So in my eyes the world is beautiful or atleast partially. There is no way a person is completely ugly. There has to be atleast one beautiful quality about them. Well I guess there IS one person who is completely ugly, that would be Satan and would be a whole different story.  Back to the topic of compliments..... The majority of compliments that are directed at myself involve my eyes. I think I was fourteen when a guy said my eyes were so cute and they were like deer eyes. I replied by saying, "since when did deer have cute eyes??" I was very mouthy back then. Still am for that matter.  Up until I gained all the weight, most guys were into my ass. I thought i had big ass for my frame, but apparently some guys dig that.  The ideal compliment I have received was from my friends and family. Everyone says I grown to be a strong person. If I wasn't as strong as I am today, I would be in a whole different situation, a situation that I do not want to even fathom.

       I woke up feeling like a piece of shit. I forced myself into the shower and started my day like any normal person would have.  Desiree and Kayla invited me out for lunch today. I had a very nice lunch with the girls and met Des's mother. Her mother is so kind, beautiful and a lot of fun. Alot like my mother now that I think about it.  Anyhow so we just hung out, went shopping and talked a whole lot (what girls do best.)  I bought some herbal capsules that are supposed to help me lose some more weight. With the amount that they costed, they better help me!! Anyway I gotta go eat dinner. I'll write more later.

       I have been big on self-improvement these days. Although one of the biggest things I need to do is give my mind a rest, I am still going to compile a list of my little hang-ups and weaknesses.  I have never liked doing laundry. Kendall on the other hand doesn't seem to mind it a whole lot. It is apparrent that he likes doing laundry more than myself. But things should be a two way street, therefor I need to start doing laundry.  I also need to cook for often. Everyone that I know enjoys my cooking and I should share the talent a little more often. And since I am living with my parents, I really should give my mother a rest and spend a bit more time in the kitchen.  I really need to drink more water, rather than fruit juice. Thinking about the amount of sugar I ingest on a daily basis makes me cringe. Sugar= liquid carbs= a no no. Not that I am some big anti-carbs Atkins freak or anything, but my teeth and body could use a little less sugar.  And I guess one thing I need to realize is that life will never be perfect and there is no use trying to perfect everything now is there??

       This weekend was hectic, yet relaxing. Does that make any sense?? Not to you, but it sure does to me!  It all started on a beautiful Friday afternoon. Kendall, Desiree and I decided to take a drive into Terrace to do some shopping. Camping was an idea we were contimplating all week. Once we discovered the 7 man tent for $120 at Canadian Tire, we were going camping!  I had to work in the bar from 6pm-10pm. So Kendall and Des set up the camp for us. Bret met up with us after I finished work and we sat around the camp fire all night listening to tunes and bs'ing with refreshments. Speaking of refreshments, I broke down and let some alcohol run through my system that night. Not that I have quit drinking all together, but just not so often anymore.  Saturday morning we all woke up freezing our arses off. Kendall and I jumped into the car to warm up at 9 in the morning. Des and Brett stayed up longer than us and were still sleeping.  I went home at around 1pm to have a shower when I received a phonecall from my boss. As it turns out, I missed the morning shift and was needed to cover from 2pm- 5pm. So that ruined most of my day.  I was tired by that evening and ended up going to sleep early. Woke up much warmer than the previous morning I might add.  Sunday was one of those days I tell ya. I did not intend to upset everyone, but apparently did. It all started by everyone wanting to go on a nature walk. Well first we had to wait for Bret to show up. And Kendall decided to go home and upload the pictures, to make room for new ones. Desiree went home to change. Well my little brother was bugging us like you wouldn't believe to go for a walk. So Bret and I took him on what we intended on being a short walk. Well as it turns out, Victor wanted to swim and had fallen down and hurt his foot, which delayed everything quite a bit.   In the meantime, Kendall was upset that we did not wait for him to go for a walk. And he didn't understand that we planned on coming back to camp right away to pick everyone up and continue on our walk. Well the shit hit the fan and it led into a huge arguement.  With my mental state at this present time, I found it really hard to comprehend what was going on between Kendall and I. I was also saddened that my parents automatically take Kendall's side. Meanwhile I am their daughter for one and they shouldnt even be taking sides.  Needless to say, Bret got scared away from the camp and never came back. Kendall stayed mad at me all night and even up until today. And the end of our camping trip was ruined.  I told Kendall that this kind of little shit was going to have to stop. It seems as though whenever I make new friends, bullshit like this happens. He claims he is jealous of every person that I talk to. I explained to him if that is the case, then we are never going to be completely happy. This trust issue needs to be taken care of. I can not live without friends in my life. I took the ring off my finger and there was talk of him moving back to Prince Rupert. But since then we have had dinner together and been snuggling. So I am not sure what to think at this point. One thing I do know is that I am hurt, embarassed and really sad.

       I have been meeting new people at work like you wouldn't believe. It is a lot of fun and makes the time go alot quicker.  The night before last I met another welder, whom is running his own business on the side. He said he would help me get my hours here and there. But I declinded to take his phone number, due to him being interested in me, not my welding.  Last night I met a former coworker of my Dad's. A great fellow Italian guy named Guido. He was amazed that I started welding and told me his Uncle owns a local welding shop. I let him know that I already applied there and he said that once things pick up he will try his best to get me a job there. If that was to happen, that would definately add the cherry to my sundae, hehe.  I have been so happy lately and am thinking that this is too good to be true. Alot of change has occured in the past few months and I feel so fortunate it has. I have faith and hope that this string of happiness is going to continue.  Speaking of the future, when I went to Pr. Rupert a few weekends ago, the carnival was in town. Instead of wasting my money on games that I would never win at, I wasted my money on a fortune teller. She was pretty good I must say. The first thing she said to me was, "you have been through some really difficult times and things are going to change, the bad stuff is over with." She was totally right. She also mentioned that the man I was with is going to last a life time. She said he is a hard worker and a house is in store for us in the near future. She said I was going to live a long life, have 2 or 3 children and a business is also in store. Bla bla bla... anyhow I've lost my train of thought and am going to call it an entry.

           A recent conversation with a friend of mine has driven me to write about marriage. We were talking about males going gaga over strippers which somehow led to marriage by his statement of, " a male does not have a pussy so he covets it ala the institution of marriage." I had originally asked him why it seems men find the need to look at ladies genitals and be all openly perverted more than women seem to be.  His outlook on marriage kind of caught me off guard and made me think more in depth about the situation.  He shared his knowledge about marriage and explained the ceremony as marriage is the remenats of the church. He also stated he will never "get married" in a Christian sense. He also said that a lord in Europe used to practice a right called premea gentra Which means the lord in the village had the right to sleep with the bride on her wedding night and went on to ask, " now tell me thats not about getting laid." I argued the fact and said, "yeah so, that was then this is now."  To me marriage has a lot more meaning and is something that I value very much. Marriage, in my eyes, is an exchange of vows. Vowing to be with the person for the rest of their lives, vowing that there is mutual love and respect for eachother and always will be. Regardless of the history behind marriage, I want to celebrate such a beautiful tradition with Kendall, the person I am going to be with for the rest of my life.

       Well it is Wednesday morning, I have a bit of time to kill before I go to work, so I thought I would start writing a new entry. I'm not quite sure where this is going to lead to, but oh well.  I am going to be putting in 40+ hours this week, which is great for the pocket and my visa bill. I have been making great tips and meeting new people. And no, not all of them are alcoholics, haha.  This is such a tiny town it is unbelievable. Upon meeting new people, usually the first thing they say to me is, "new to town eh?" Another common question I get is "why Kitimat?"  Well you know what? I love it here and there is everything I need here. I have had my share of city life and larger town life and based on that experience, I would rather be where I am today.  Kendall is turning 30 in a few months and I am sure he is wanting to settle down and purchase a home. The town is so quiet, clean and close knit. I would love nothing more than to be able call Kitimat my home.  I like the fact that Terrace is only about 35 minutes from here. That way I can drive there and shop around and get outta town for a bit, without spending half the day travelling.  The only thing I don't care much about small towns, is the rumours. Before I moved here I vowed to myself that I will not get led into the BS and will keep my nose clean. So far I have lived up to that promise and plan to keep it that way.

       I have been doing quite well with my diet lately. My weight seems to at a plateau and hasnt came down any more in the last week. But so far I have lost 20 pounds.   In the beginning I was slightly cutting down on the food intake and walking a bit more than usual, and ultimately didn't realize that those little things would make such a huge improvement.  I went to Rupert the weekend before last and all my relatives and inlaws commented on how great I looked and asked how I lost the weight. I was astonished to realize that I shed 20 pounds upon stepping on the scale.  I am much more happier now and I think that has a lot to do with it. Most people don't eat when they are depressed, but I am the opposite.  As much as I loved Prince Rupert, it was not healthy for me. The only people that I met were totally into drinking and not the sorts of things I was into. I guess I should have made more of an effort to meet healthier people, but I didn't. Atleast I learned a lesson from that. Like here in Kitimat for example. I have been minding my own business and not getting to involved with people in general. I hope that doesn't sound too anal or snobby of me. But over the years I have learned it is really hard to trust people. I have put so much faith and trust in people and in the long run, been shit on. So now I am very cautious.  I drank a fair amount in the last few years. I was a 'weekend warrior' so to speak. Since January 1st of this year, I think I have only drank 3 times. And never got drunk, just a nice glow. I think that has helped with my weight as well. All those toxins I was filling my body with and also dehydrating myself, eeeww not good.  Now that I am working in a bar, it gives me all the more ambition to stay away from the booze. Man people sure are ugly while under the influence.  Anyhow here is a picture of me last summer, when I packed on the pounds. Man my face is bloated!!

       Why do people find the need to make up stories?? What is the point? This is a question I ask myself time and time again, and never seem to come up with one solid answer.  Some say that liars are just mentally unstable. Some say they live boring lives. Some say they are starving for attention. But why is a liar a liar??  I get really choked when the person takes me for an idiot when they lie to me. The lies are usually so obvious and quite off the wall. When I get lied to, I immediately try think of something creative to say. But usually end up biting my tongue and responding with a simple, "oh ya."  When it all comes down to it, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I don't have a lying problem. Although if my life depended on a lie, man I would be dead. I can't lie for the life of me.

                       Kendall and I got together about two years ago. As soon as I arrived in Northern BC I met him. Since then, nothing has been able to keep us apart.  We both have a lot in common. We are both the eldest of our families. We both learned responsibility at a young age. And we both come from Nisga'a ancestry. ( Well I'm part European as well.)  Normally whenever I meet anyone, I get really shy and uptight. But with Kendall I have always been relaxed around him. Him and I are best of friends and tell eachother everything. We can be honest with one another and not get riduculed because of it. We have our ups and downs, which is only normal. But can not stay mad at eachother for more than 5 minutes.  Only five months into our relationship, Kendall purposed to me. It wasn't a cheezy proposal, but was very intimate and something I will always remember. There was no doubt in my mind that he was the one I wanted to marry.  We since set a date for November 6th of this year. But plans have changed and we have different financial goals to attend to first.   Planning a wedding for the sizes of our families is very complicating and mainly expensive. We are wanting to run away and elope, while various family members oppose to that. But hey, it is our love right?? I'll keep it posted. Who knows, I am so spontanious, we might end up taking off in the summer time and coming home married.

       I am the eldest of five children. I have three brothers ages 9, 13 and 21. And one sister who is 11.  My 21 year old brother and I were very close as children. Once we hit puberty, the hormones hit the fan. Since then all we have done is fight, such terrible arguments that would sometimes get physical. I don't even want to think about them.  He has been living in Vancouver for the past year and a half. During that time I noticed he has grown a lot as a person and really matured.   He made the big decision of moving down there to be with his sweetheart while she went to school to be a optomitrist assistant. He has been working steady ever since he has moved there and seems to be quite happy.  Kendall and I are wanting to take a trip down there in the near future. It would be nice to rekindle my friendship with my brother.    Brothers Nick & Mike

       Well it has been over 2 months since I have been made my parents home, my home. I wasn't really used to it in the beginning, but am now adjusted. Living with my young siblings has just given me more of a reason not to want children anytime in the near future.  I am glad I am at home. I threw a lot away at the young tender age of 17. I moved out of my parents home a week before my 17th birthday. I thought I was all grown up. I was jealous of my baby bros and sis. I had a controlling boyfriend whom I worshiped. I am so lucky that I made it through all the ups and downs, I am now a stonger person.  In the past six years I have temporarally lived with my parents, but not for long. This has been the longest experiment so far and I am enjoying myself. Again it is only temporary.  Originally my boyfriend had thought he would be working in Ft McMurray for a year, but plans changed. He is now back here with us.   Until he gets something steady, like at the mill for example, we will make our home here.

       A few relatives are currently suffering in the hospital. One special person in my life in particular is my maternal Grandmother. She is 81 and a very strong woman. She looks young for her age and still motors around.  I went to visit her on Mother's Day weekend. She was feeling under the weather for a while, so my Mother decided to get her checked out at Emerg. The Doc's realized she was bleeding internally and needed a blood transfusion. Last summer she had a major heart attack that damaged 40% of her heart. So any little thing could cause her to leave us.  As I have been growing as a person, death is really something that has had an impact on me. I have had so many loved ones leave me behind, which has only taught me to live life to it's fullest.

       First the surgeon (if you wanna call him that, I think he is more of an 80 year old butcher than anything ) scares me with the thought of skin cancer and advises that I have my birthmark removed ASAP. That gave me a lot of anxiety and such, which wasn't really something I needed on my already much too heavy plate. One week later he ordered me under the knife and went through with the procedure. After the operation I felt even worse about the whole situation because of the looks of my wrist.  Three weeks have passed and the scarring is setting in. It isn't pretty at all and I am contimplating complaining to my physician with hopes of him referring me to a plastic surgeon.  Last Thursday I was happy to hear that the skin cancer test results were negative. So what a waste of pain, scarring and anxiety. Ah well the scar will give me character I suppose.      Before   After   Current

       Looks as if I will not have a chance to write in this all weekend. Kendall and I plan on leaving for Prince Rupert tomorrow.   I am probably coming back on Friday with my cousin, while Kendall spends the weekend with his relatives.  I got my job back. Man I feel loved. Can you believe that I quit my job on the spot, only to be rehired a few weeks later? What is up with that? I guess I must be a good employee, yeah what can I say?  Heh... I'm kidding, I seriously do not think that highly of myself. My head is not swollen (only my brain is.)  Kendall and I just got back from good old Walmart. He spoiled us again. I bought some new tighty whities. You know what they say about new underwear, right? Well actually that is only for single people, so it doesn't apply to myself. But I am sure Kendall will agree that making a good impression requires the use of new underwear. Skid marks are a turnoff.  I really hope my cousin is able to come for a visit. If he does come, I plan on showing him around and showing him a good time. We might even set the tent up down by the river if the weather cooperates. He loves his fishing, as does Desiree's boyfriend. A couple of beer and a fishing rod will keep 'em outta our hair for a while, heh.  I hope all you Canadians are all geared up to celebrate our Country's big day. Cheers!!

         You and I both know I do not know any jellyfish, but you get my point.   In the past, I have let people walk all over myself. I have let them use me, abuse me and take me for granted.  I am very fortunate that I realized that there is more to life and that there should be equality. I also noticed that only as much negativity can get into my life, as to how much I let in. I am in control of my life. If I choose unhealthy and unethical practices, that is my choice. I discovered that if I had a game plan set in place, it would leave hardly any room for failure or surprises.  I have been blessed with many values and morals that my parents have taught me from a very young age. Although I did not live up to those values at particular times in my rebelious stages, I have learned the hard way.  We have intuitions and feelings for a reason. Never ignore your feelings, always reason with them. Deal with them, do not hold off. I made the mistake of not dealing with issues right away and eventually they caught up with me. I know try to deal with them as soon as possible to avoid the snowball effect.  Not only am I writing this to share with the world out there, I am writing this as a little reminder to myself, whenever times are tough. We all have an abundant amount of inner strength with abilities to put it to use. Value what we have and never think about what we don't have.

       Kendall and I really enjoyed ourselves this weekend. Although I came down with a terrible head cold, I still had a great time.  Kendall spoiled me rotten. He bought me a new pair of Oakleys, they are fabulous! And many other goodies that I won't get into details about and bore you to death.  We really enjoyed the festival. Lots of great music and since then, I have became a fan of Spirit of the West. We managed to sit in the front row and gave our eardrums a thrashing!   We were fortunate to have great weather the whole time. It cooled off Saturday evening, which was perfect.

       Well, I changed my mind once again! I finally got my first tattoo, along side of Kendall last night.  I found the perfect design that totally suits me. And Kendall found a nice arm band design. Our tattoos aren't tacky, nor are they tiny. They are perfect!!

       We are driving back to Kitimat to pick up a few things and picking up Dani on our way through Terrace. We decided to remain in Smithers for the weekend. We are going to catch the MidSummer Festival, it should be a blast. The only band that I recognize is Spirit of the West.  I backed out of getting a tattoo today, thank goodness for that. I realized that a few years down the road, I would be kicking myself in the ass for it. I am very indecesive and change quite a bit. So I thought I better not get one done for another few more years. It will save me some turmoil and the people around me, some headaches.  Kendall is getting a small arm band done today. It is small enough to add on to and alter. And something that can not be screwed up. I vowed I would never get a small town tattoo. I want to go to Sacred Heart in Vancouver.  Anyhow I guess I should go grocery shopping. I promised Kendall I would make some sushi tonight. We switched motel rooms, so we now have a kitchenette, yay!!

       Last night included many funny situations. Kendall and I had a few drinks with his coworkers and attempted to cool off outside.  The motel we are staying at mainly consists of road construction workers and tree planters. The tree planters are hilarious. Always so down to earth and slightly off the wall.  I mingled with a few of the tree planter girls. I guess one felt very comfortable around myself and came over to where we were all sitting and asked to borrow my brush!! It was hilarious!! I did not dare to look at Kendall and his friends when she asked this, I just proceeded to the car and luckily I had a travel brush in there that I gave to her. And yes, I told her I didn't need it back!! We had some pretty good laughs about that.  Kendall took me out to Boston Pizza for dinner last night. It was scrumdiliumptious!! ANyways, I'm out... I'll write more tomorrow.

       Talk about time warp! I am in the middle of Smithers, when a siren sounds. I thought it was some sort of disaster signal or something. So I obviously asked around and to my surprise it sounds at noon, for lunch hour.  The drive here was a tad bit depressing due to the site of some of our beautiful forests smoking away. It is almost eerie looking already. There are very few flames compared to last night and the night before, so hopefully it only smoulders and eventually extinguishes very soon!!   So how is everyone enjoying our extrordinary weather?? I managed to camp near the Kitimat River this weekend and saved some guys life, liturally.   We set up camp on Saturday afternoon and noticed a fella sleeping in his car. I assumed he had a long hot day on the river fishing, and was taking a rest. He never moved all night. In the morning I brought him a muffin, some 7Up and some beef jerky, thinking he needed nourishment with this insane heat. He was very delerious, but I did not want to question him or make him feel uncomfortable, incase he really was alright. SUnday night my buddy gave him a couple of cool wet towels to freshen up with and a litre of water. Yesterday morning I decided that if I didn't call the police to go check up on him, he wouldn't make it. Sure enough he was hospitalized. A bit of a nerve racking situation, and I am glad I got him help before it was too late.

       Saturday night we set up camp down by the river. It was beautiful! We found a gorgeous sand bar to set up the tent. We caught ALOT of sunrays and were extremely hot. I managed to get a bit of a burn, but it's all good.  When we arrived at the campsite, we noticed a man laying down in his car, taking a nap. A few hours later we were worried, because he was still sleeping. So Donny and Victor went over there to see how he was doing. He said he was alright. Yesterday morning he was still in the same position. Being the little mother hen that I am, I decided to buy him a bottle of 7Up, a muffin and some beef jerky. He thanked me so much and seems to be a very odd man. There is really no explanation of why he has been lying there sleeping for over 24 hours. I am beginning to wonder if he is a heroin addict or something. Last night I had a dream that I went to bring him some water and he was dead. It haunts me. I am wondering if there is anyone I could call with my concerns, because this doesn't seem normal. But we did our best and our good deed for the month!  A butterfly followed me around all day yesterday. I am not sure why it liked me so much, but it landed on me several times. We managed to sneak in a photo.  Anyway, I better get ready and go help those guys clean up the camp.

       Well it is everyone's Pops' special day tomorrow. And let's just say I am really unprepared.   Not that my Father expects anything, as he has always told us to save our money and that he doesn't need anything. I hope he realizes how much he deserves recognition and knows that all he does is very much appreciated.  I have always looked up to my Father. He is the strongest man, with the biggest heart. He has taught me values and life skills that I have totally benefited from. He has held our family together through thick and thin. He gives his family his entire life. He has inspired many people throughout his lifetime and doesn't seem to have a bad bone in his body. He is well respected and very easy going. He has been my role model for 23 years now.   My mother and I are going halfers on a 'power painter' or something that makes painting the house, all the more easier. I plan on cooking a special dinner tomorrow night. It is too darn hot out there to be having an early dinner.

       Kendall is working in Smithers this week, so I am going to tag along. I need to get away and rejuvenate myself. I wouldn't mind exploring a new little town and acting like a tourist. Sounds like fun to me.  We might head to Prince George this weekend and spend a bit of time in the casino. Not quite sure yet. I think we should pack the tent and some sleeping bags and camp out somewhere. Who knows what we will end up doing, we are last minute decision makers.  Speaking of decisions, I am one of the most indecisive people you will ever encounter. I suck at decisions, like you wouldn't believe. The problem I encounter upon making decisions, is that I think way too much. I always think, okay if I do this, then this could happen, but if I do that, it probably won't happen. So basically I think too much and often find myself worrying about the future.  Anyway.... I must go on with my day and get organized. Ta ta for now!

       Okay so I lost it at work last night. And this morning started off the wrong way as well.  Our dog hates the neighbour. Plain and simple. She continues to bark at him whenever he is in her presence. It is only natural for a dog to defend his or her own property, right? Well that is what she does and he continues to yell and throw fits at her. I caught him kicking dirt at her this morning. She wasn't even in his yard.   The neighbors had a load of top soil delivered, which they convieniently dumped it into half of our yard. So he had the nerve to stand in our yard, yelling and throwing dirt at our dog. Enough is enough.   I told him that it is a two way street and that his little maingy dog barks all day long when they are not at home. He ignored that and proceeded to tell me to do something with our dog, I said a few more choice words and that was that.   I feel bad for my parents, incase that episode creates more problems for them. But we are people too and we all have rights.  I phoned the SPCA asking for their advice. They told me it was only natural for the dog to protect her property and that dogs can not distinguish between idle threats and actual threats. She said the neighbour is lucky that our dog didn't bite him. She also advised us to keep a close eye on our dog not only for the dog's protection, but for the neighbours. The neighbour obviously isn't in our dog's good books.

       Well that barmaid job was sure short lived. For starters I never did care for working in a bar that was trying to get rid of it's bad reputation. Also the strippers aren't something that I ever pictured myself around. I enjoyed talking to a few of the customers, but many of them I didn't have the time of day for.  It urked me to watch those people get so plastered and make fools of themselves. It also bothered me when I thought about how their sober friends and families are affected by their drinking problem.  My baby is making good money right now, so there is really hardly any need for me to be working at such an establishment. I am sure my honey is happy that he now does not have to worry about me working at the bar at night.  Kendall and my Dad brought me down some different sandals, because the ones I was wearing were hurting my feet. The sandals I changed into were quite comfortable and fine. A few guys decided to stand outside the hotel and drink their beers, which is illegal. I immediately walked over and asked them to come inside and one of them stepped towards myself and knocked a beer over. My boss told me that I walked too slow. So I replied by saying, "well since I am not good enough, then I quit." And I walked off the job. Just like that. I hate being a quitter, but it just wasn't meant to be. I'm hoping I get some welding work in the very near future.

       Well the strippers are in town again. Those pretty girls are helping me make some phat tips to take home. The anual Eurocan shutdown is taking place and there are thirsty construction workers galore in this neck of the woods.   Aw man I love showing off my engagement ring whenever a horny guy starts to hit on me. Most back off and make it easier for me to do my job. I have to be blunt with a few of them, I can't believe they actually think they might have a chance.  I have done even more networking as well. I have met one of the superintendants of Eurocan who knows my father and told him about Kendall. He said he was already aware of Kendall and will see what he can do for us. Remember what I said a few weeks ago? I said that I have a feeling Kendall will be getting some spectacular news in the near future. I am STOKED!! ( But won't get my hopes up, we have alternate plans already thought out.)

       Of course I am thankful for the life I have been granted by the big guy up there.  A few years back I was at a very terrible crossroad that could have led me into a lot of trouble. Luckily I chose the straight and sober path and am now the strong person I am today.  At the age of 13, the past started haunting me and the sexual abuse was being thought about. Being so young and niave, I had thought it was partially my fault. Like any other victim of sexual abuse, I started blaming it on myself.   Luckilly I have very supportive parents that care about me in an enormous way. I fortunately disclosed to them what had happened to me when I was a toddler.  As you are probably aware I am the eldest of five children. I have one sister who is now 11 years old and three brothers, ages 9, 13 and 21. If it wasn't for my little sister disclosing her abuse at the tender age of 2, I don't think I would have dealt with mine, even to this very day.  My sister was just learning how to talk at the time and was a very expressive little girl. I fealt like a piece of shit when she disclosed. I felt that if I had brought up the fact to my parents, she could have been protected. But I can not cry over spilled milk and always blame myself. The past can not be changed, only the future can be well thought out.  So once I hit puberty, the shit kind of hit the fan, so to speak. I was so fucked up from the abuse, my mind was everywhere.  I have to admit that I got into quite a bit of trouble as a teenager. I was an unfortunate follower. I am sure glad that today I am more of a leader and have a mind of my own.  I never did like alcohol, until I turned 19. At that time life was one big party. I must have partied for two years straight. I met the wrong people, got introduced to hard drugs and life was a downward spiral from there.  At 21 I met someone who was going through the same transition I was. We helped eachother stay straight and sober. We maintained fulltime jobs and kept busy. But as lovers, we were not meant to be.  I feel that I successfully combatted the drug addiction and alcohol abuse, but he still had his weak moments. One giant weak moment ruined our entire relationship.  In May of 2002, my Father and I had moved to Northern BC. My mother, former boyfriend and the rest of the family had stayed behind in Powell River to finish the school year and finish up at his job.   Within 24 hours of my departure, he had gotten drunk at a campsite, on a logging road and totaled MY car. After that, I had no respect for him whatsoever. Why should I give him respect when he obviously had none for me? But I was attached and still cared for him in a slight way. I cared about his future. I cared that he had made it far and knew he had potential to make it farther. We were both enrolled in a welding program for September of 2002. Therefor, just because we were breaking up, I didn't feel he should put his plans on hold or scrap them all together. So he still proceeded to move up here and get on track.   In the meantime Kendall and I grew very close. Kendall was now my best friend and no one was going to get in our way. So I enrolled in a welding program at a different campus and moved in with him.  The ex started school as well, but his true colors shined through and he ended up dropping out and eventually moving back down south.  I was actually glad he moved, because like usual, I blamed myself for his unsuccessfulness. I had it in my head that, IF I didn't break up with him, he would be doing better today. But I have learned that I have no control over other people's lives and never to blame myself for others' actions.

       Kendall can not find the ring that his grandfather passed down to him. The ring was last seen in the tent and has not been seen since.  I recall placing it in a laundry bag, that he has since cleaned out. It was one of those moments that I can not distinguish thoughts from reality. I may have intended on moving it to a safe spot, but not actually moved it. Confusing.  I feel bad for him, I know how it feels to lose such a valuable item. It actually isn't the fact that is valuable, it is the fact that it can not be replaced. The ring has been passed down to a few generations.   At this very moment Kendall is scanning the campsite, in the rain to boot. I feel so terrible and helpless.  UPDATE: Kendall found his ring in the car, where I placed it  :)

       Kendall and I have been very busy this week. Kendall managed to swing some late nights camping and still made it to work on time everyday. He slept in once, but still managed to make it on time.  I am not in the mood to work tonight at the bar. I am sick of drunk people. I am tired of faking my smiles and talking to strangers.  Apparently one of the main welding shops here in town just cut a new deal with Alcan. Meaning they will be making money for a good year or so. My fingers are crossed that I get a call from them. I am so wanting to say goodbye to serving people and start fusing some metal!! I miss welding like you wouldn't believe.   I'll write more later when I get a chance. :)

       Although thoughts of raising a family travel through my mind at times, I still don't think it would be a wise idea.  Yes, I am very young and have a lot of time to make up my mind. But I hope I refer to this entry upon making my final decision.  I don't think Kendall will be missing out by not having children either. He has a little brother and dozens of little cousins to fill that void.   We have talked about children and how great it would be to start a family together. Like the perfect story book couple. But obviously now is not the time in our lives to make such a decision. At this point, our careers and future are at a crossroad and who knows what the big guy up there has in store for us.  Like I said before, I am hoping Kendall gets some good stable fulltime work. That way we can finance a home and be on our way to a very happy, stable life. Our ideal settling spot would be in this town of Kitimat. But if Kendall is unsuccessful at finding steady work, the big city is waiting for us. If we were to move to Vancouver I would have no problem finding welding work in a sweatshop. I would then get enough hours in to go back to school and obstain my next welding ticket.   So basically these next few months are vital in our decision making and only time will tell our future.  Back to the tender subject of babies, I really do not think it would be a good idea to ever have children. Yes I would make a great mother and all, but patience is one virtue I am lacking.

       So much for the walk and so much for the tan. We plan on setting up camp tonight. Yay!!!  I don't work until Thursday afternoon, so I thought might as well take advantage of the good weather and time off.   I work every night next week. It is going to be a busy week with the mill shutdown. Tons of thirsty construction workers are going to be in town. I'm not really looking forward to dealing with drunken men, but I will be happy to take tips from them. I feel so evil at times. I still feel out of place for serving some alcoholics. You can see it written all over their face that they have a drinking problem. And the thought of how it affects their family and loved ones haunts me at times too. But hey a job is a job. Plus the extra bit of cash is nice.  Although we have a brand new tent, I am wanting to borrow my Dad's tent trailor he just picked up last week. It isn't brand new, but it is SOO nice. So Daddy if you are reading this: Please let me borrow your trailor. I promise to take care of it and treat it like it is my own. And can we borrow Abby as well?!? Hehe Love ya pops!

He has worked construction with this company for a few years now. Right now they are prepping for the anual mill shutdown. I am hoping they need more welders and give me a chance. My fingers are crossed.  Last night Ken, Donny, Des & I took a ride into Terrace. What a beautiful night it was.   I am planning on going for a long walk today to pick up my car. I would say it must be about 6km from here. Then off to the tanning booth I go!

I made it from a denim skirt and made it look all frayed and shnazzy.  This week I altered two skirts of mine. Originally they were long skirts, now there are knee length. I am not the type to wear mini skirts for various reasons. My mother admitted she was scared that I was going to mess my clothes up, hah.  I have purchased a whole bunch of clothing that I plan on altering. Mainly hot pink and black material. I think I might make some halter tops for work, we'll see what happens.

       Shoes are great. Shoes take you places. Shoes give a person character. Shoes protect. Shoes give height. Shoes make a woman feel good.  I started liking shoes around the same time I hit puberty. I love shopping for shoes. I can not imagine how many hours I have spent shopping for shoes.  My father has been calling me Imelda for years now. I could only wish I could afford 10% of Imelda Marcos' shoe collection. She apparently has over 1500 pairs of shoes. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to visit the shoe museum in Manila, Philippines during my trip there in 1995.   I am not quite sure how many pairs of shoes I have actually owned. At this very moment I own close to 40.   When I first moved to northern BC two years ago, I had to get rid of a few pairs of shoes. And when I moved from Prince Rupert to Kitimat, I gave away a few pair as well.  I have now promised myself that I will never part with my shoes again. I want to be able to wear them years down the road when they come back in style.  Anyhow here is a photo of my current collection:    here are my favorites:

       This is a very touchy subject and I am willing to talk about it, knowing that not many people read this crap.  I have grown up in a society that deemed natives as being "pissy indians." I went to private school until grade seven and happened to be the only other native kid in my class next to the poor fellow who reaked of urine and had an alcoholic mother. Since we had the same sort of racial profile, some kids chose to mistreat myself in all sorts of ways.  Growing up in Powell River was challenging when it came to the subject of race. Being French, Italian, and Native made it difficult at times. I would have a native call me a indian-wannabe one day and the next day a white kid calling me a white wannabe.  Once I hit puberty I often questioned whether or not I was proud of my ethnic roots. I must admit I wished I was completely white. It is rather pathetic to think back upon. I used to use major sunblock to prevent my skin from going any darker. I used to use pale skinned makeup on my face, which in turn made my parents call me Michael at times, haha. Thank goodness I was too scared to bleach my skin. Otherwise I would have looked even more pathetic than I already did.  I was never ever proud of my native heritage until I moved to Northern BC. Most natives that I knew in southern BC weren't anything to be proud of. But upon moving up here I met my mother's relatives who are all very respectable people. Call this racist, but I feel that there is a big difference between natives and indians. Indians are what you see littering Hastings street. Natives are educated, have values and live normal lives.  God I hope I haven't gotten myself into trouble speaking in this manner. But it is something that I had to let out.

       My little cousin will be arriving for a visit this evening. I started talking to him online a few months back and we have really gotten to know one another. I remember him when he was just a little guy and to think he is now a teenager.  He is an only child and I think a visit to the big family up here in Kitimat would be really beneficial for him. Also, he is a city kid, so small town life would be a real eye-opener for him.  I took the evening off to go meet him at the airport. I can't wait to show him a good time with my family and Mother Nature.

       I decorated the bar last night. I made giant palmtrees, put up streamers, scattered seashells around the place and made the bar more tropical. Susan ( my boss ) spoiled me with drinks on the house and I got a bit tipsy with Denise and Kendall. We had a very nice time and I am impressed with the way the bar turned out.  I really hope it is a successful night. We have a limbo contest planned, drinks specials, hula hooping contest, and I will be making up a very tropical cd. I am sure we are going to have lots of fun, but the only problem is that it is scheduled the day before the Nazareth Concert (which I will be attending!) So I am not sure how many people in Kitimat are brave enough to party two nights in a row.   Amber and Jay ( Kendall's cousin and girlfriend from Prince Rupert) convinced us to buy tickets for the Nazareth concert. I didn't really want to go considering that there would be 3000+ people and I am not wanting to avoid drunken old people. Call me anal, but the middle age men are the worst for drinking. I have noticed this in the bar. There is always a few 45+ year old idiots making fools out of themselves. I thought only young women did that, boy I was wrong!

       I haven't been making many appearances online lately. I have been busy enjoying our beeeeaaauuutiful weather.  Kendall bought me a fishing rod and reel the other night. It is a very nice Diawa. I am counting on catching me some fish in the very near future.  We went swimming down at the river a few times in the past week or so. I am so thankful I live in such a beautiful Province. We truly live in a paradise.  Desiree, Gina and I went for a drive to Prince Rupert yesterday. We did a bit of site seeing and shopping of course. And I forgot the camera, once again :(  I hope everyone else is enjoying their summer as much as I am. Have a great one!

       I will be the first to admit that I was a fairly negative person at one point and really did not have much nice to say. But then I realized what an ass I was and started trying to ignore the ignorant and start bringing out the positive in everything.  I am really tired of reading people's negative remarks about other people. Why can they not just focus on themselves? I guess it makes people feel better, especially when they are miserable. But how selfish and narrow minded can one be?  I contribute to a forum, which is based in the same area of this Province. At first I was just a smartass, then I got a bit serious, and now I treat the place as a total joke. The webmaster is such a great guy, but some of the other anal mental midgets really ruin things on there. So I thought I would play their little game and continue to post ridiculous comments, just to irritate them of course. But today I have decided to refrain from posting garbage on there and sit back and watch the circus.  I really like the site, it contains a lot of useful information and I often find myself having a different outlook on things, after reading other people's opinions on various topics. But there is this one know-it-all in particular that just drives me nuts and I wish I could torture his little carcus for a while. I must stop with the negativity. The little dude does have it goin on upstairs, but his character on the site is just an egotistical fat head, that always irritates me.  For every negative comment I make, I am going to try make a positive one. Balancing out situations is much healthier. Especially considering I do not want age into a miserable old hen.

       Ideally Kendall and I wanted him to get a job at the mill, so there would be more stability. But with his carpentry construction work, we do not have to worry about income.   Therefor, we are going to seriously start house hunting. We have one house in mind. It is a smaller home, but very well kept. We are going to phone them for a viewing in the near future.  I'm so excited!! But I am not in the writing mood, so I will catch you later ;)

         I was nervous to actually bid on items I was interested in. I must admit that I can be a pessimist at times and usually think of the worst case scenerio.  As it turns out I have been the winning bidder on a few items on Ebay recently. I am now waiting for them to arrive at my door.  Guess what I purchased?? Come on, if you have read my previous posts you would already know that I absolutely LOVE shoes. And yep, I bid on two pairs, and won them both, wooohooo!! I just hope they are in the same condition as the photo depicts them to be. I'll update this post upon their arrival.

        Kendall and I need our own place again. This is crazy to be living with my parents and their young family. Too chaotic and too many differences.  There was a reason I had moved out at the tender age of 17 and this new experience of living with my parents once again has reminded me of why I moved out early in the first place.  We have an appointment to look at a duplex this evening. I forgot I am scheduled to work at the very same time, so looks like Kendall will go check it out alone. I trust his judgement. He knows what I like and don't like, so he will tell me what's up.  But I am wondering if we could be wasting time and money by moving out. If Kendall were to get hired as a fulltime employee in the near future, which is very likely, we would purchase a home. The market is really low right now and it is the perfect time to mortgage a home.  Once again, time will tell.

       I am only 23 years old and suffer from back problems!! Sad eh? It all started from an injury when I was 14 years old. I had tripped and fallen down a flight of stairs onto a concrete floor. I suffered a fractured tailbone and a major concusion, or however you want to spell it :p  For the past couple of years my lower back has been bothering me even more so than usual. I went to my family doctor on numerous occasions, but I can never book an appointment when my back is actually in a lot of pain. By the time they are able to schedule me in, my back feels okay.   I went to emerg. the other night and they gave me a shot to help with the pain. The doctor there was an asshole though, enough said. I'll get myself all worked up if I think about that inconsiderate asshole again.  So I think I will go take my daily dose of painkillers and rest my back. I need to start walking more, if only this ugly weather will let up. Hello Mr Sunshine!! Where are you?!?!?!?

      &nbsp;Kendall and I went to Terrace last night,&nbsp;&nbsp;not only celebrate his birthday, but to celebrate Sam's 28th! We had tons of fun. I managed to boogie down a few times, with the help of alcohol of course.  &nbsp;I was so happy to visit one of my close friends, Dani. Dani is naturally a wonderful person. She is so generous, caring, and a lot like myself. Her and I share so many likes and dislikes, it is kinda freaky!! Not only is her name Danielle, but she was born Feb 25th (a day before me) she loves leopard print, and everything else I like.  &nbsp;Dani and I met in Ottawa on one of our Student Association trips. We totally clicked right from the beginning.  &nbsp;  Here are some photos of our evening on the town:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danielle &amp; Dani     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendall &amp; Sam     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance Queen

       Wow, Kendall is going to be 30 tomorrow. Did he rob the cradle or what? Heh, I'm kidding.   As it turns out, there is approximately the same age difference between my parents, so it is all good.  Before I met Kendall, I preferred older men. Simply because they know what they want and they know how to get it.   It seemed as though younger guys were often mislead by the media, etc. The younger guys also always seemed to be interested in the anorexic chicks with ugly faces. It didn't matter what their faces were like, skinny was in.  Kendall looks a lot younger than he is. I hope I grow old to be the same way! He has such grace and creates such a positive aura wherever he goes. I am sure he attracts the ladies of all ages. But guess what ?? He is mine!! All mine, forever and ever and ever. Yeah okay, I will quit typing like a psychotic control freak, although I can be that at times! :p  I have the entire weekend off this weekend. It is going to be great! Kendall's buddy wants us to go out on Friday, we will see what happens.  I plan on cooking an amazing meal for Kendall tomorrow. Not quit sure what is going to be on the menu, but it will be scrumptious dillyumptious I tell ya!!  I am heading to Terrace to pick him up a nice silver chain. I already bought him a new hat and a dirty 30s card.   It is hard to tell if he actually cares about turning 30 or not. He says he does because of how young I am. But age is only a number!

          Anna Nicole Smith may come across as a dumb blonde, but she is one amazing lady. Not only is she beautiful, but she had the brains to make herself known and make herself money.  She had a rough start, having to strip down to nothing and all. But she met the right person to keep her on track and make herself known. I firmly believe she did not use the old man for his money. She obviously had a very close friendship and bond that you and I could never be the ones to judge.  Anna has so much charisma and style. I adore her.

       I noticed I haven't written anything of interest lately. I actually haven't had much interest in the internet at all lately for that matter. Call it what you want to call it, but I would definately say that I am lacking my usual pizazz.   I have actually been partying too much. That is the problem. My brain is kind of numb and out of order at this point.  It is not like I have been partying everyday, don't get me wrong. But compared to my usual once in a while routine, I have been partying atleast once a week. Sad, but true. The sad part about it is that I don't have anything to be actually celebrating, but still drink. Go figure.  My excuse is that it is summertime and that it brings out the thirst in people. (Nice one eh?)  What I really mean to say is that there is no excuse for my behaviour. I am 23 years old, party is over.  I was doing so well last winter. Totally staying away from booze altogether. I am not sure what happened. I guess drinking is only a problem, if you make it a problem. I have a great time with Kendall and our friends when we go out. It is not like we are getting into trouble or anything. Maybe I just have it in my head that drinking is wrong.  Actually I know what it is. I have seen alcohol do so much damage to people's families and friends, so it makes me very cautious and gives me a guilty conscience.  I just need to remember one thing, I am in control.

       Why do people try be someone they are not??? Why can't everyone just be themselves? These are questions I ask myself from time to time.  Mainly when I am in Prince Rupert and Terrace, I notice native kids thinking they are black. I mean yes I am sure they can relate to black people when it comes to the racism they sometimes encounter, but why do they walk around with limps and their hat sideways?? Why do they talk like they were raised in the projects?  Back in the late 90s I thought, okay this is just the style of this year, it will soon pass. But alot of young people have carried it on. I must admit that I used to really enjoy hiphop music, but the stuff nowadays all sounds the same and is garbage. Maybe I am getting old or something?  Another thing I must admit to is following fads. I used to watch television and be like, "oh wow she is wearing that, I want to get that." Nowadays I just incorporate the latest fads, with stuff I like. I like to alter clothing as well. Well with the shape of my body, I need to alter clothing. I got the supposive hour-glass shaped figure. My bottom half is much larger than the top half, but I am not complaining. I would rather be this way, than have chicken legs with a big jelly belly.  I was thinking about catching a movie with Kendall tonight, since Prince Rupert has a really decent movie theatre, compared to Kitimat. But it looks as if it is too late for the last show.  Initially our plans were to come here last night, but we were still recovering from out night out in Kitimat. We had a blast with a buddy that we recently met, his name is Brent. Brent  seems to be the type to share a friendship for a lifetime. He is really down to earth, positive and all around good guy. Cheers to Brent!

       Our relationship has been a rollercoaster for this past while. At this present time I am really confused and want nothing more than to be happy.  I really don't know what it is that is getting between us, but it is turning a really good thing into something that is terribly hard on the both of us.  Kendall is such a good man and I seem to be such a little witch lately. The only thing that bothers me about Kendall is his stubborness and old fashioned ways. I don't blame him for that though, I blame the way he was raised.  I am not sure why he is so insecure, but he is. I never knew him as a power tripper, but lately he has been wanting me to be at his side at every moment. I have insomnia lately, therefor I can not fall asleep on any given notice. Kendall always stays awake until I come to bed. I mean come on, I am not a dog, I don't need a master, and definately do not need to be babysat.  If he can not handle the real me, then I don't think things are going to work out. I have finally let the real me outside to the real world and am not about to change myself.  Kendall hasn't spoke to his family for about a month. I think that is something that is really bothering him.  On his 30th birthday he did not even get a phonecall from his Mom. He ended up calling her, only to find her pissed on a Thursday night.  Maybe Kendall needs some time away, to think things out. I think he might end up going back to Rupert once he gets laid off from this construction job.  To sum this entry up, I am confused, lost, angry, upset and very sad. Are we going nowhere, fast????
