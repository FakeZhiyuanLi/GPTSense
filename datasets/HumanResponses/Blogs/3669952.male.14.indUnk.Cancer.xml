      Don't even ask about the title... one of the random things I am gonna use....70 41_1_ 1/\11-10 (41\1 |2341) 71-115 1 541_1_173 '/01_1!!!! Erreh. A little 1337 for ya. I swear I won't do that ever again! (Lie.) But anywayz I like posting here and saying whats on my mind... It is around 10:38 PM in Florida even though it doesn't say so and I am really tired. It isn't cool. But anywayz I am here to talk about the dreams. Have you ever had a really good dream? Then have waken up to find that dream completely un-realistic because that would never happen to you? Yeah. Happens to all of us. No one can escape them.. But sometimes, don't you just WISH those dreams were real? I have. I have my whole life. I would do anything to have my dreams come true... Sometimes. Dreams are one of the more unexplained things in life. There are many rumors about why we dream and I am going to look into them, But unforunetly I have came up-prepared in this Post about dreams. I will make another post after I do some reaserch on this fine subject. Do you ever wonder WHY you dream the things you?.. I will get into that subject too. I belive all dreams have a purpose behind them, Whether they be good OR bad. I don't know why that reason is there, Or why we even need sleep. The body is a thing of mystery that I have yet to solve through all my years being in it. Ahh.... Now to talk about scary dreams. Don't you just hate the ones where a killer is after you or something? I remember when I was younger i used have a dream about the alien from the Alien movies was after me, And almost everytime it got me, But I woke up. Is that I sign of something? We may never know. But my small discussion on dreams is over for now, But may (and will) continue!   ---The Quite Insane: (Wolf That Cried Man)---

      Hey people. I felt like posting again to tell you what is up with my life right now. Well, I got a REALLY awesome girl friend and she is great to me. I love her! Well anywayz I am sitting in my dark house, typing my blog and listening to random rock songs... Great right? I would do something but ya know... There really is nothing to do. I wonder if anyone but my friends I make read this will accually take a look at this scary, but inviting place(XD I LOVE YOU GUYS!). You know President Bush is a complete idiot. I hate him to death. Do you relize that the only reason our troops are in Iraq is because Bush wants their frikken oil and "revenge". I don't belive that our soldiers are over in the damned country because of terrorists. Bush may deny that he is after Iraq's oil... But that is a sack of bull. See I can't vote, but I would vote Kerry. But if it was my choice I wouldn't vote for either and I would let someone other than the two be prez. But that is just me... I know alot of you people out there will disagree with me on this, But this isn't your blog now is it!? =D But, my friend just shined some light onto me. I think Bush should remain prez and finish this stupid war before he gets out of office, because (So she says) Kerry is in the political party that would pull back arms and apologize, then reduce armed forces, Which MAY lead to another 9-11. Anyone wonder why his ears are so big and he can't talk right? I do. (referring to Bush) I think everyone should learn german and talk to him like that and see how he likes it because you have no clue what he is saying..... You know we have the most nukes than any other country on this Earth? I find that strange that we need so much fire power... When are we gonna use them anyway? All they do is sit in a warehouse somewhere... Imagine if a freak accident happened and they went off? How screwed would we be then!? Err sorry about me ranting and raving....  I hope this has shed some light onto you people about what is going on...  ---The Quite Insane: (Wolf That Cried Man)---  ("Kerry is in the political party that would pull back arms and apologize, then reduce armed forces, Which MAY lead to another 9-11."

      This is a place of utter stupidity, and a world where the tales you know and love get mixed up, Along with the world of reality and make believe. You should be scared when you are reading these blogs... You may never know what will happen. First off, I'd like to thank the ones who ARE here. I have no clue why they are.... But whatever. Atleast they took the time to visit this place of insanity. You never know what I might talk about in this blog... People. Places. My weird versions of story tales that you all know... I'd like to start off with the "The Three Little Wolves"   There once were three little wolves who got tired of living with their mom... (See these wolves aren't that little, They are thirty and they haven't moved out yet... What losers...) So they decided to make the cheapest houses possible. One of the wolves walked up to this man who had some straw. So he said "Hey, I will give you all that I have for that straw". The man agreed, but the wolf just ate him. So Mike (The wolf we are talking about) made his straw house. He liked it alot. The next wolf (John), who was a little brighter than Mike, found a man with sticks. He said "Hey, I will give you all I have for those sticks" the man agreed, but like Mike, John ate him. Then John made his stick house. The smartest wolf of all his brothers (Moe) found some bricks. See this kid was brighter then the others, But yet, He was still a complete idiot. So... he just ate the dude and stole the bricks. He built his nice and cozy house. Then the fuzz found out that the wolves had eaten the men, So they sent out their bounty hunter pig, Billy. When he got to the first house, he threw a torch onto it and burnt it down with the wolf inside. Then he approached the stick house and called in air support. They bombed the place to hell.When he reached the brick house, He decided to do it Matrix style. Billy kicked down the door and walked in. "Hello Mr. Anderson... *cough* I mean...Moe" Then Billy jumped into the air and kicked Moe through the wall of his house. It crushed Moe's skull cause he hit head first, but the house went down with the wall and killed Billy. Then a nuke fell onto the land and killed everyone.  Moral? DO NOT WAIT TILL YOU ARE THRITY TO MOVE OUT. It only leads to death. And it makes you seem like a bum.    Hope you liked my first, and not last, Twizted TaleÂ©!  ---The Quite Insane: (Wolf That Cried Man)---

      My title has nothing to do with my post, But I am here to tell you this is where all my serious issues with this planet will go (except for the on A Twizted Tale ((which you should go check out)) because I posted the one about Bush there) I am hard-headed and my ideas will not be swayed, Not even for you dumb people. Just kidding. But feel free to hang about till I post some more or whatever. Maybe you should go read my story in A Twizted Tale (http://wolfthatcriedman.blogspot.com/)to pass the time! =D I love plugging my own work! But anywayz, things in here will mainly be serious (which is really hard for me) And I will talk about major issues in society and what-not. Maybe just a few things that bug me in general. Hope you have a good time looking at everything. Everyone that accually looks at this (If you do I love you!)I wish you a great time in both of my blogs!   ---The Quite Insane: (Wolf That Cried Man)---
