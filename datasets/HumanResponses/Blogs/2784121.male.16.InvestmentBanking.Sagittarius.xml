      Ok, Friday, the last day of the work week, hooray!  Now I get to play saxaphone at the Joy of Music Program tomorrow.  Argh, the pressure, no just kidding, I've got the piece down, it's good to go. Other than that and my new mattress coming tomorrow, I have absolutely nothing good to say... so, I'm going to tell the spider story.  So this happened one night taking a shower, I'm scrubbin' myself, mindin' my own business, having a grande olde tyme.  Then, who should appear?  That's right Mr. Masivspydr, if you don't get the clever last name, may god have mercy on your soul.  Anyway, he was repelling down from the fan above my head, turning it on must have agitated him... of course I didn't see him yet, he was still above me.  I'm still scrubbing, spider's still repelling.  Then... RIGHT ON MY FRICKIN NOSE!!!  Of all the places the damn spider could have chosen to land, it chose to land on my nose.  No warning, it just landed right on my nose.  I swipe at my nose while jumping straight over the edge of the tub on to the cold floor of my bathroom.  The spider flew through the air and hit the floor of the tub, and I stared it down, I stared it down good.  That spider was afraid, fear surged through all of its eight puny limbs... and... DOWN THE DRAIN! I hate spiders.

      Da first thing... So I was like, hmm, maybe I should do the blog thing, but then I was like, but I don't think I'd have anything to post...  Apparently I don't, at least not today. (edit) I finally got the colors set up, except the active link color... really bothering me.  As far as I can tell, all of them are set to shades of gray, but apparently there's one that's not. Oh well... Ah, but there is one thing, a poem from one of the good folks at SCC (SimCity Central):   Here is my poem. It's entitled Spacealienjesusbushiloveyoubutonlywhenyouaren'twearinganyclothing  JESUS, BUSH, JESUS end.   Touching, huh?

      Many of you know that i had some kinda wormy/virusy type thing on my computer that opened a port and let crap loads of adware get onto my comp.  Of course, it was impossible to open "My Computer" or the control panel or anything remotely related to changing system preferences or viewing what's on the hard drive... that's always fun.  It was like that for a couple days, then I was like, LIGHTBULB!  So I went into safe mode and did a system restore, and it's all good now.  Today I pretended I was sick so I could stay home and sleep, I woke up at 6:30, like I usually do, did the sick thing and then went back to bed.  I slept till noon, it was good.  Since I woke up, I've been working on a house in a little progrem called  urlLink SketchUp .  That link will take you to their site, go ahead and check out the gallery.  Anyway, I have the exterior of my house done, here's a pic... or 4 pics in one...

      So, I got my permit today, didn't mow any pedestrians down... which is good.  So... umm... watch out for me on the road, I only got 14 of the 20 questions right, which is bare minimum.  Don't know how I managed to score so low, I think it had to do with the stupid questions with specific numbers.  Remember kids, for the written driver's test, study the things that you would least think to study.  It asks you about insurance premiums and speeding fines, those two I got right, but I don't remember the ones I got wrong.  The ones I got wrong had nothing to do with actually driving, which is why I got them wrong.  Oh, and I'd make an awesome Nascar driver, because I can't do right turns...

      Those of you who have weak stomachs probably don't want to read this, but the only two people that I know read my blog consistently probably should.  It's late night again and I'm in pensive mode, so I've been thinking about my life, particularly suicide, not that I'm suicidal, I'm not... anymore.  I was in 6th grade.  I think I was dealing with a lot that year, I was getting the worst grades I ever had in my life, I dealt with rejection and being an outcast.  Bad grades means the first appearance of C's on my report card, that may not be a big deal now, but then it was for some reason, and it wasn't the biggest reason for my depression.  Rejection came from a crush, who I asked out, no one knows about and no one will, that means it wasn't Amber(who I did ask out in 6th grade and was rejected by).  Being an outcast, this is a good one.  My friends found new friends, we drifted apart.  I didn't make new friends in most of middle school up until late 7th and 8th grade.  That year I had no one, I didn't talk to anyone in class apart from English where I had two friends, even at my lunch table, I didn't have any good laughs.  The people I had been friends with my whole life were the people I sat with at lunch since I knew no one else.  And of course, there was ostracism from all directions, but we won't go into that.  Looking back at it, it was really bad, worse than I have thought up until now.  I don't know how I survived, certainly not an act of god because god had abandoned me early that year.  I know at one point I found the biggest knife in our kitchen and had it stretched out before me, the terrible blade poised to plunge into my chest.  Before I could do anything, I broke down, crying, put the knife away and laid on my bed, just crying.  Even now, every once in a while I get depressed, think about suicide, but these days, every teen does that.  I do think about it, but then I remember my life, and things come back into focus.  I remember I have a better future lined up than a lot of people, and I have people around me who would do anything for me.  Plus, I like to please people, I don't like people to be miserable on my account, and I think about what my friends and family, even my dog would do without me here.  So, everything is good these days.  Man, that felt good.  Oh, and, yes, I was completely serious about all of that.

      I'm slowly starting to realize how much homework I have over this vacation.  I have to read half of a book, which is 83 more pages, write two essays and finish another essay.  This weekend is gunna be a bitch, that's for sure.  Oh, don't forget the 10 sentences in French I have to write about a movie I don't remember that we watched in class, honestly, I completely forgot what happened.  On top of all that, I have crap for time to do it, I'm awake approximately 12 to 14 hours a day now.  I go to bed around 12 - 2 AM, so I can't do homework that late, and on Friday, I'm going to the RMV to get my permit, finally.  Oh, my history teacher is a psycho, the two essays and reading half the book is from her.

      I went to Greendale Mall 3 times yesterday... god what a depressing day.  The first time, me and my dad took my grandma out to eat, then we went to Best Buy/Gamestop and I got 3 games.  We went home, I put Rise of Nations in to install it, and my CD drive decides to hit it with the lens and make horrible buzzing sounds and spit dust out.  Needless to say, we went back to Best Buy and got a new CD drive.  We get home, I install the CD drive, and put Rise of Nations in.  It doesn't work. The damn CD drive wrecked the CD, and I had checked if that had happened two hours before and the CD seemed to work fine.  So, once again, we went to Greendale, to Gamestop and got a new copy.  I was supposed to have 3 new games at home, installed by 3:00.  Four and a half hours, a new CD drive, and three visits to Greendale Mall later, that was finally accomplished.  Rise of Nations is a great game, though. *thumbs up*

         Posting this pretty late, because I just finished getting my computer settings all in order.  Recently "got" a little program call WindowBlinds, which skins windows, so you can make windows look like OSX(mac, but why would you want to?) or whatever.  So I got me a good skin, and a nice cursor to go with it, I also rearranged all the items on my desktop and in my start menu.  That was real fun!  Anyway, other than that today was incredibly boring, I played video games, then I begged to go to Best Buy.  I didn't get to go to Best Buy, so I begged for ice cream... did I get ice cream? No, of course I didn't.  There were to things I wanted today and I didn't get either, but my mom said I can go to Best Buy and get ice cream tomorrow... erm... today, cuz it's actually 1:45 AM, which makes it the tomorrow that my mom was talking about.

      For some reason, I feel like talking about that new movie by Mel Gibson,  The Passion of Christ .  Now, I don't know much about it, but part of me has to think that it is in fact a legitimate, historical movie and not an antisemetic piece of crap that tries to prove that the Jews killed Jesus.  Now, I do know that there were Jews that wanted Jesus killed, a fact, and I also know that it was the Romans who in fact, literally and directly killed him.  Now, this is what I think the deal was:  From what I know, this is how it went.  There were certain messianic Jews(Jews who believed in the messiah) who believed that Jesus was the messiah.  It is stated in my temple's prayer book, "... for the coming of the day when Elijah's spirit will herald our redemption from all sadness and every bondage."  So, the messiah is the second coming of Elijah(don't exactly know who that is).  There were also people who believed in Jesus as the messiah but were not Jewish, and wanted to get in on it.  At the time, you were only Jewish if you were circumcised, and no one wants to get circumcised when they're 20 or 30 or something, that would be incredibly painful.  So, new Jewish sects were formed that allowed people who were not Jewish to participate and become Jewish.  For a time, this was all fine and dandy, but the people who weren't circumcised thought they needed something to symbolize the covenant with god, and thus, baptizing.  Gradually, this group grew into a whole new sect of Judaism, and there was a Baptist church of Judaism.  Eventually, it broke off completely and became a new religion, Christianity.  At first, just a small cult, it grew rapidly and spread like the plague... ahh, twisted humor.  So anyway, this is the part I'm not sure of, but if I had to guess, the traditional Jews objected intensely to these new sects.  They objected so intensely that they wanted Jesus killed.  That's what I think was probably how it went down, but again, the last part is only guesswork.  Well, wasn't that nice and informative? ;)

      I think I thought too hard today, I had a horrible headache by the end of long block.  It persisted all through last period, the bus ride didn't help it, nor did the walk home.  Man I hate headaches, but it's gone now, thank god for Tylenol.  Anyway, as a couple of my readers (not that I have more than a couple) my know, I was working on a building during my long block study yesterday.  I am an aspiring architect, by the way.  So, I finished it at home the same day and didn't have a chance to upload it to my hosting service.  Now it is uploaded, and I have it posted in my " urlLink Show off your architecture " thread on SCC(my new building is at the bottom of page 4).  I encourage you to check it out, and once you've done that, I encourage you to check out the first three pages of said thread. That's it for today!

      So... We're going to hell... definately.  And by we, I mean me, Pete and Adam.  Well, you may argue that everyone is going to hell according to the bible... especially christian bibles! ;)  But, of course, we are going to hell many more times over than the average person.  We like to poke fun at things, but we do just that to things that probably shouldn't be poke'd fun at, however funny the result may be.  Anyway...  I added the commenty thing, tonight rather than last night contrary to what the current comments may lead you to believe, so feel free to comment.

      So, today, already in a bad mood because my stomache was hurting, I was walking home from the bus.  Some dumbass decides to honk at me as I'm walking down the street... Fuckin seniors.  So, I figure one of these days, I'm going to buy me a gun.  If one of these retards decides to honk at me... BLAM!  One tire gone, if they decide to honk again or get out and yell at me, BLAM! One more tire.  IF I HAPPEN TO RUN OUT OF TIRES, you know what gets shot next.  I'll be all, "HONK ALL YOU WANT BEEEYATCH!!"  So, if the next day, they decide to drive up and be like, "Hey punk, you got that gun with you?" And of course, I will innocently reply, "Why! whatever could you mean? I have no gun!" So, they will say, "Good, cuz now I'm gunna kick your ass." And I will say, "Oh, well, you might want to know about the steak knife in my backpack, then whip it out."  That should take care of the problem... hehehe!

      I think I'm extremely tired... I'm not completely sure, but I think I am.  As many of my friends know, on Monday, I went to bed at 11:45 and every day since then it's been 10:30 or 10:45.  Today, for example, we were playing basketball in gym and I couldn't do crap.  I didn't hit a single shot... NOT ONE!  That's not normal.  Another thing, I was walkin down the hall behind this girl, holding my books in front of me, with my hand over them.  She stops, I'm totally spaced out and I walk right into her and my hand hits her ass.  I was like oh... ew ew ew (she wasn't exactly good looking), but apparently she didn't notice.  So... I've been completely out of it all week.  Anyway, we've been doing these music presentations in English all year, I haven't been able to find a song.  That's why I haven't gone yet, but there are only 3 people left to go, and I'm one of them.  I'm scheduled to go in 2 weeks.  So, I figure if I can't find a song, I'll just go with some random one by Greenday about getting high or killing yourself.  I'll be like, "I picked this song because these are the things that I do... or try to do every day! *smiles*."  That should be fun...

      So... My first school night sleep in my new bed was last night.  Unlike Adam... not me, the other one, I got tons of sleep, woohoo!  That bed, mattress rather, is damn fine, the $1300 paid off, I must say.  I've also been having back pains for about 3 weeks now, and after last night, they stopped.  Even though it was insanely expensive and is half as tall as me, I love it. Anyway... Douche bag (John MacLellan) was acting rather more douchey than his usual douchiness, the douche...  Not so much that he was being mean, just a giant douche.  We were playing basketball in gym, and he comes over and says, "Shaquille O'Neal" about 3 times.  He seems to be the one person, other than my dad, who can make my blood pressure rise by opening his mouth.  AWEPIJRFANOEGHAIEHFOP!!!! -> it's hard to express anger on the computer, so I just violently type random letters in caps and put exclamation points after them...

      Ok, kind of a late post, but here it is anyway.  I'm going to start out with the school day.  So, I completely forgot about my history homework last night, and I copied Jamie's during lunch.  We had a quiz on it, on which I got an 88, which was better than Jamie (insert devil smiley here).  Then we did our presentation on the "roaring twenties," my topic... or... my group's topic was art and architecture, and, of course, I did architecture.  Mrs. King said we did well.  Then, on my way to English, some dumb bitch (a teacher) hit me with a TV.  And of course Beamer(worse than douche bag) was walking right behind the TV so he made some stupid comment, probably involving me being Jewish.  At home, I didn't post earlier because I had to do my home work in order to get  urlLink Far Cry .  Now I have it, and it's installing, it's on the third disc... out of 5, that's right 5.  It takes up 4GB on the hard drive... massive, but completely worth it.

      Ok... so uhhh... douche bag(hehehe, again) was making all sorts of comments in gym again, he was saying people's last names in a supportive manner, but of course, OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  And every once in a while when he was getting really "pumped," he would make noises that sounded a little like a monkey.  Oh, yes, from now on, I AM going to point out everything that annoys me about him.  Anyway, has anyone been walking down the glass staircase, then looked out the window at Main St. and the two church steeples and the rolling hills and thought, "That is just beautiful."  Of course, then there's the inevitable thought of why can't I be out there.  So anyway, it looks even more stunning in winter after a snowfall, or in spring when everything is green, or in fall at the peak of the colors.  I think I'm getting a little too um... what's that word... sappy... ummmm corny.... maybe sentimental in my old age; these days I've often found myself looking out the window in the car or a building and thinking wow, isn't nature amazing.

      I don't know if anyone else heard this in gym...  but at one point, our team had the ball down near the goal, and douche bag was like, "Come on guys, the best offense is a good defense!"  And I was like... sssssiiiiiiiiiggggghhhhh... I mean honestly, the least he could do is get the phrase right.  So I figured I'd edit this post and put in some other gym stories.  Like our sub, we think he was a nazi, and I commented that he probably would have looked more convincing with round glasses and a little mustache.  He kep telling us to stand against the wall, or on that line, and I was just waiting for him to add that we should also dig a hole that we will fall into when he shoots us.  Oh, and he said mmmkay... ya know, like Mr. Garrison, South Park...  That was funny.  Also, someone, don't remember who, got the soccer ball stuck on top of the batting cage, so we had to throw shoes at it to get it down.  Someone picks up Murtaza's shoe and throws it, of course, missing by several dozen feet and landing it right between the wall and a speaker about... hmmm, 20 feet up.  Our sub said that he should try using the basketball backboard to climb up and get it, and I'm like, *cough* liabilities....  One other thing, this year has to be the best year I've had in a long long time, possibly since kindergarten.  I've actually caught myself smiling spontaneously with no reason, I'm just smiling, and that's odd.  Is anyone else haveing like... a really good year?  Oh, one more thing, my new avatar (picture that goes with my name) on SCC:

      2 POSTS IN A DAY, IT'S A FIRST!!!! PARTY!!! WOOHOO!!!  Anyway, I was watching the Nickelodeon show, Fairly Odd Parents, if any of you know that show. I actually kinda like it... I know, I'm juvenile.  Anyway, the principal of Timmy's school had been bitten by a bug that made her evil.  She disallowed all the students to go see the president speak(who, oddly, talked like Bush, but was dressed as Washington and later, Lincoln).  She then put them in "preemptive" detention for "bad things she thought they might do."  And I was like, here we go satyr and social commentary in childrens shows!

      There were a couple stories today that I thought had the stuff for my blog.  First is about gym...  We were playin volley ball, and Tim Clark, you know, black crazy hair, glasses, he's a skater.  So, at one point, ball hits him square in the face, he kinda giggles and shakes it off.  Then, another time, the ball hits the wall behing him, bouncing back and hitting the back of his head, he does one of those things where your head goes foreward and one eye is half closed.  He just kinda looks around like, wtf just happen... maaaan.  Then Adam leans over to me, "That kid is so burned out, seriously."  And, of course I found that absolutely hilarious.  The other one is from java, this guy was telling a story about these 3 guys who were, also, completely burned out, high on something, I don't remember what.  But they were driving around, and they saw a garden gnome in someone's yard, so they went over, took it and stuffed it in the car.  Then, they had a conversation with it, and they were all like, "Oh man, this gnome's talking to us!"  They get home, and the gnome tells them to feed it, but they pass out.  Like 3 days later... having the strangest feeling of deja-vous right now.  Anyway, like 3 days later they come to and there's this little girl in their house, an they're like, whoa man, how'd she get in our house.  Dammit, SHE WAS THE FUCKIN GNOME, crap, we gotta call the cops or something.

      You gotta admit, I've got the slickest, funky fresh...est lookin blog out there, like so many people who don't exist, cause mine's the only cool one.  I'm modest, very very modest, and I believe that's one of my best qualities, but it's so hard to choose since I have so many.  Words I find amusing: Pancreas Primp Stagecoach Samuel Tamper... and slightly related-temper Frivilous Grub Coronation Pliable Tinker Walkman Affixed Plebiscite Antidisestablishmentarianism(had to do it, still don't know what it means) Fig Tumble  I don't feel like thinking of anymore, but feel free to tell us all the words that you find amusing.

      Stayin home today, cuz I'm sick.  So if anyone in any of my classes reads this, especially Jamie, give me the homework.  My mom checked my forehead, said I had a pretty high temperature.  Other than that, I got a network adapter for my PS2, now that's hooked up and so is my comp cuz I got this little LAN party router and it came with 4 12ft network cables.  All that for $40, I was like, damn, that's a good deal.  But as of now, I only have 2 games that are online enabled, and one of them no one plays.  So, I'll have to get SOCOM and THPSU and some of those other ones.  You know what I'd really like to see?  The next GTA with online games, there's one big city and up to like 40 people who can play in it, then you can cooperatively take on the cops or fight each other or race er whatever you want.  The new GTA game is confirmed, and its title is GTA: San Andreas, so it's in LA, not Las Vegas.

      For lack of something better to do, I'm going to tell you the sentences that are on my refrigerator(made with those magnetic poetry things).  Oh, and sorry in advance to Adam, as some of your old sentences have been destroyed.  1. Squirm to the rhythm and celebrate champagne. 2. Live on free pie. 3. Kill for delicious coffee cake. 4. Dazzle prisoners you never fish with. 5. Listen, perhaps corduroy lingers in the pool. 6. Delicious dogs have eternity. 7. Picture prisoners eying caramel. 8. Desire growling candy. 9. To be in melting butter. 10. Soon ask if he smiles less every concrete flower he beats. 11. Never blush like belly I poison. 12. Salt kills babies. 13. Drink life as you decay. 14. Out of an angel, peace fools yesterday. 15. Exploring dark velvet grass.  Oh and one thing at the end of the day, Adam, I hit you and said hey, then me and Emily parted with you(not that I was talking to her) and headed downstair.  Mr. J happens to be coming up the stairs, and he smiles and greets Emily, Emily does the same.  And then, I thought to myself, "Why would you say hello to him, how can you still do that with a straight face?"  Anyone who has heard the story about the Cape knows what I'm talkin about.

      Nuther douche bag story! Woohoo!  So this time, we were playing volley ball in gym, and my team hits it over the net.  The ball goes over douche bag's head and he turns around, by this time the ball's really low, and dives for it.  He completely misses the ball, of course.  All I saw was him seeming to float in mid air for about a second, then fall... THUD!  It was so hilarious, but you had to see it to really understand the hilarity.  It was just one of those things, he didn't bounce or skid or anything, he just fell and stayed there, it was like when you lick ice cream in a cone, and it falls out.  The ice cream just falls and hits the ground and sorta stays there, that's what douche bag did.

       Teh story about biology 2day:  Chances are you won't find this nearly as funny as we did when it happened.  Me and Dan (Dan Areolli... Arioli... whatever, everyone know who he is?), we were working together on worksheets in bio today, we're looking at an RNA base sequence and writing down which amino acids each three bases made.  This is essential, we were decoding things that we, ourselves, wrote.  So I look at the paper, then a double take, and I take the paper Dan's writing on, I look at it and I'm like, wtf mate, we switched papers somehow.  This is particularly strange because I don't even remember touching Dan's paper, and now I'm writing on it.  So it turns out, that for like 5 minutes, we were answering questions on each other's papers.  We had a good laugh, in fact, we really didn't stop laughing until the end of the period.  And the fact that one (for some reason i spelt that wan the first time), the fact that one of the amino acids was named asparagine(like asparagus... hehehe) made everything even funnier.

      This one should be short and sweet...  So I was lookin at my toilet while I was takin a piss today.  We recently got some kinda blue disinfectey stuff, so I'm watching the blue water turn green slowly.  And I wonder, "Hmmmm, is that light color or pigment color?"  Then I'm like oh ya, it's blue and yellow combining to make green, of course it's pigment(primary colors being red, yellow and blue).

      So, I pretty much just got back from brushing my teeth several times over.  For those of you who don't know, my pen exploded in my mouth during long block today.  I had just finished my quiz and I was chewin on my pen, and this incredibly foul taste fills my mouth, "Oh crap..." I exclaimed.  The French teacher looks over, and she says, "Oh, Adon (Adam in French), Il y a un explosion dans ta bouche."  Which means, oh, Adam, there's an explosion in your mouth.  Pete was kind enough to point out that that sounds very dirty...  So anyway, she sends me to the bathroom and I do my best to wash it out, to anyone who saw me, they could tell it didn't exactly work.  I come back, and we're playing "Aucun Idée," meaning no idea, someone is picked to say aucun idée when asked a question, and everyone else just answers it, then when the person says aucun idée, everyone changes seats and the person who doesn't have one is next to ask the question.  Of course, as I am just getting back and have started playing, someone says aucun idée and, of course, I'm left without a seat.  I go up to get my question, Madame Sanfacon hands it to me, "Qu'est-ce qu'est délicieux à manger?" is my question.  That means, what is delicious to eat?  And I thought to myself, "You planned that, bitch!"  So I go to some people, they all say cake or chocolate, then I go to Joe, and he says... pens, I stare him down and shake my fist.  That was today's only real highlight.

      DOUCHE BAG STORY TIME! WOOHOO!  So we were in gym class, playin dodgeball.  The rules had changed and there were no people (medics/nurses) to... "bring people back from the dead."  Which actually just involved getting tagged and standing back up.  Anyway, this apparently meant that douche bag had to make a show of trying to avoid the flying green balls.  So, he's about to get a ball thrown at him, so he hits the deck, at this point, Adam... not me... Parison... throws a ball.  Smack, hit douche bag's face dead on, and that made my day.  On my way home, I realized how annoying early spring is.  I was walking home through various levels of thawed, wet ground, and my feet were wet.  I don't like being dirty or wet, it just doesn't suit me, so, obviously, early spring doesn't suit me.  But I guess it could be worse, it could be snowing and 10 below...  Oh yes, and the thing in English.  Mr. Balogh decided to suggest a St. Patrick's day party, my class being overwhelmingly Irish, the one European nationality that I'm not.  He was like, bring in your kilts and shalelieghs (spelling?)... as far as I'm concerned, they can kiss my shaleliegh... dammit Brendan, because of you, I know Irish phrases, of course if Brendan read this, he could correct my spelling.  Stop Adam, you're getting off topic.  I'm English and Scottish, French, German... Holland...ish, Swedish, German, so on and so forth.  NOT IRISH!  Sometimes people, sometimes.

      So... It's like 1 o'clock er somethin... I still consider it Saturday, because days aren't determined by the cycle of the sun and moon, days are what you make them, and don't let the government tell you otherwise.  Since there don't seem to be comments any more, I'm going to use this portion of the post to respond to other blogs.  In re to Adam's Blog: I told you the world was a wonderful place, and that nature is a beautiful thing.  If anyone still doesn't believe me, I took a picture of Yosemite National Park, It'll be later in this post.  And happy birthday Emily!  In re to Mike's Blog: Cool it, that's the way it's always been in high school, but trust me, I know people who say the tables turn and the women are the... cough, sorry for being blunt... horny ones in college.   The second part: I got back from California, and man, the roads are a bitch there.  They've got overpasses flying every which way, and onramps coming into the highway from the left... and they'll do anything for a + shaped intersection.  Then there are the coastal highways, I saw a sign on one of them that said "Curves and Hills next 63 miles."  But the place is beautiful, Cali is just amazing, go there if you have the chance.  What else... I have a sun burn, and watch tan lines.  My uncle's house is probably worth a million dollars, and it's smaller than ours... he's got a senior position in IBM marketing and his wife has a senior position in Oracle, oh, Pete, there are going to be people from both those companies at the tech forum.  My uncle has a Jaguar... and a Mercedes...  Oh and my cousins' house has to be worth a couple million, it's on a hill overlooking San Fransisco, and it's probably twice the size of our house, but Ted (the husband/father in that family) works for NASA.  So here's the part you've all been waiting for... well... maybe just some of you...  the picture of Yosemite!      EDIT:  And of course, now that I post, the comments work again, and I look like a doofus.

      So, I'm in California, sitting in a cushy chair in my uncle's house outside San Fransisco.  We flew in business class (aka first class).  Man is it good, we had a friggin 3 course meal: appetizer was fresh mozzerella and tomatoes with a garnish, there was a salad with an apple vinagrette dressing with a hint of cinnamon, then I had BBQ chicken for my entree.  THAT WAS ON AN AIRPLANE, GOOD FOOD!!!  Anyway, my uncle picked us up in his brand new Mercedes, amazing city, San Fransisco.  We have a Mitsubishi SUV rental, California has some crazy traffic patterns.  What else.... hmm, there was some violently red water... that's about it.  Amazing views in this city, Lombard St. "crookedest street in the world."

      So... gym was cool today, we got our mouthguards (which I actually took the time to boil and mold) and we owned the freshmen at mat ball.  Which reminds me, because we had gym with two freshman classes, we had to deal with like 50 douche bags.  Yes, 50, there were a crap ton of them. WAAAAAY TOO MANY!

      ---for some reason, I couldnt publish on Saturday, so here is Saturday's entry---  I forgot to put my dream in here, which I was going to do until I was invited to a party at my friend Zach's friend Adam's house *reader wipes forehead... that was a hard sentence*.  Anyway, here's another of my seriously fucked up dreams:  Two guys are sitting at a table, a girl is in the other room.  One guy at the table is the girl's father, the other is a "suitor" of some sort.  The girl walks into the room with the table and sits down, they talk.  After a little bit of talking, a hole is cut in the floor below the suitor's chair.  He falls through the floor and hits the floor below, then an invisible man chops his head of with his fingernails (I forgot to include the fingernail thing when originally telling the story).  The girl and her father are upstairs freaking out, and the girl falls through the floor in the same manner.  You see the back of her head and the mirror in front of her reflecting her face and the face of the invisible man.  I suppose mirrors thwart the invisibility thing.  So anyway, the last thing I saw is the invisible man standing behind the girl breathing down her neck, because I woke up right then.  Friday - Saturday On to the party at Adam's house (we'll call him fatty, because that's his nick name).  There was another Adam there, they call hime wind boy, and after telling them my dream, they dubbed me dream boy.  Some of the other people there decided on Adam Poo, in honor of my POOfy hair.  We played some gamecube, PS2, Xbox, 64, and of course some Far Cry.  We watched fight club and terminator, and some various anime, some Space Ghost and Aqua Teens.  We played capture the flag in the dark at about midnight, and in the morning, we went out into the woods with a machette, a maul, a sharpened hook, a baseball bat, a staff and a pick, we hit dead trees and bushes with those.  Today(Saturday): Worked on my SCI with Jamie (we have to teach history for a day).  That was pretty uneventful.  Then I went shopping, I got 7 shirts, 4 pairs of shorts, a bathing suit, and a new wallet, watch and sun glasses. I put on some of the clothes when I got home and my dad was like, "You could be a male model."  I was like... riiiiiiight.  My new watch's face can change from red to black, it's wicked pisser.  Did I just say that?

      So, I had a good study... how was tech for u guys who didn't get out of it like i did?? hehe...  Anyway, in study, the kid sitting across from me definately either had pot or was high, cuz it was wafting.  OH was it wafting, but anyway, he's cool, he was doing some homework about brains and crap.  One thing, for all you straight guys out there who think Asians are wicked hot (you know who you are), Tila Nguyen is where it's at.

      So I saw this thing walkin home today, it was all rainy and crap, right?  So I was walkin, and there was a stream of water running down the side of the road.  Nothing unusual in itself, but there was cardboard in the water, also not too unusual.  I did a double take, and I realized that the cardboard wasn't wet, the water was just flowing right over it, but not getting it wet.  Hmmm... what else, let's see, Far Cry and ska are still the two most awesome things on the face of the earth.  Oh ya, my niece is coming here from michigan tomorrow.  You know, my niece that's 3 months older than me.

The Jewish Bible is Tanakh- Torah  -Genesis  -Exodus  -Leviticus  -Numbers  -Deuteronomy  Nevi'im, or Prophets  -Joshua  -Judges  -1 Samuel  -2 Samuel  -1 Kings  -2 Kings  -Isaiah  -Jeremiah  -Ezekiel  -Hosea  -Joel  -Amos  -Obadiah  -Jonah  -Micah  -Nahum  -Habbakkuk  -Zephaniah  -Haggai  -Zechariah  -Malachi  Kethuvim or Writings  -Psalms  -Proverbs  -Job  -The Song of Songs  -Ruth  -Lamentations  -Ecclesiastes  -Esther  -Daniel  -Ezra  -Nehemiah  -1 Chronicles  -2 Chronicles  BTW, I would totally name my kid Amos.  That's an awesome name.

      CONFIRM'D  Yes that's right I was confirmed tonight... yes, confirmation, Jewish confirmation.  Bar Mitzvah is a right of passage, after it, you can read from the Torah; confirmation is... confirming one's beliefs and such.  Anyway, I was presented with a full Jewish bible as a gift from the temple... which I'm sure Parison will want to borrow.

      Part 2 of my rant:  SOLDIERS ARE PEOPLE.  Don't tell me not to list death stats, you would care how many people died if one of them was you, or a family member, or your friend.  HEY GUYS, ever think about how you would feel if your best friend didn't come to school one day? then maybe the next day, and the day after that?  What if it was because he/she was killed in a war, would you still say, "That war sucked, it wasn't important."  I don't think you would, in fact, if your best friend died in a war, then someone told you that the war was stupid, you would probably beat them to a bloody pulp.  One more thing, you say that WWII did no good, has any war ever done any good?  I think WWII did do some good, but that is outweighed by the bad, because war is never good...  WWII was not started solely because of WWI, WWI gave the means for another world war to start, in that it made conditions harsh for Germany, but would WWII have started if Hitler hadn't taken over?  Would Germany have been like, "hey, lets kill shit!"?  No, if you had studied WWII at all, you would have known that the driving force behind the war was lebensraum for the Aryans, not,   oh we're pouty and angry because of WWI  .

      Ok guys, something seriously pissed me off today, and while I may not have shown it so much at the time, I really was pissed.  I'm at my bus stop, and I ask Mike if he's had a WWII test yet.  Then this whole thing started with all you AP people bein like, "OH WWII WAS CRAP, WE DIDN't STUDY IT."  You say it wasn't important, that WWI was more important, and you studied that more.  WWI caused WWII, and while that is true, it's not the only cause, Hitler wasn't a NAZI because of WWI.  Come back and tell me that WWII wasn't important when you find out about you relative who died in it.  Or maybe an entire side of your family because of the whim of some racist asshole. Come back and tell me that WWII wasn't important when you actually believe it, and not because your teacher told you to.  We can't turn our backs WWII simply because it was started by something else.  Mike, you're Russian, almost 40 million soviets died during WWII, what if your grandparents were among those, you wouldn't be here, would you.  Think about that, it could have happened, easily. Also, you say that VE day (victory in Europe), wasn't a victory, shit guys, honestly, you don't even know when VE day was.  HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS, WHAT IF NO ONE HAD BEATEN THE AXIS, every Jew, Pole Slav, Gypsie, gay, etc, etc, etc would be dead, or enslaved, is that better than what we have now?  COME BACK AND TELL ME THAT WWII WAS'NT IMPORTANT WHEN YOU GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEADS  I'm done.

      Guys, strangest thing JUST happened.  I came home and went into my room, then shook the mouse to take my monitor out of sleep mode.  What do I see, well, Norton AntiVirus doing a scan of my hard drives.  And, I though, no jokes, "Aww, how cute." Needless to say, I'm fully in awe of my own strangeness right now.

Then another $20 in other quarters I've had in my pocket and then throw into a little bottle, and $5 more in dimes.  Pete, ya know that nice 120 GB, 7200 RPM hard drive that I was drooling over... hehe, all mine, and for only 85 bucks.  That leaves $90 of the money I counted up plus the $16 in my wallet!

      So... it's been a while, but you've been commenting, good work.  Douche Bag!  now.... what did he say, oh yes.  When Anton kicked the ball in mat ball in gym today, Douche Bag was all like, "Whoa now, that's a bullet.  BULLET, what a bullet."  And then he was like, "Corpse!"  And I was just like... what the hell is he talkin about.  Then I heard him mumble to himself, "You get it...?"  which I think he meant someone to hear.  And for a second I felt a little bad for him, because no one was paying attention to him, but then I was like.... pfft, he's a douche, what am I thinking?  Oh yes, and Adolf Pele... HEIL PELE!!!  So... I was thinking about how stressed you all get about things.  I think you should all be more like me, I just don't care, but I still do well enough in terms of grades for my liking.  Then everyone else bitches about their 5 tests coming up, and I'm like... CHILL DAMMIT!  It's not worth worrying about, I have 5 tests too, but do I care, NO, and as a result, I'm much happier than half the people I know.  I'm just laid back, I'm tellin you guys, it's the way to be.  IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING SOMETHING, AND THAT THING IS NOT OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE, DON'T DO IT!  IT'S NOT WORTH IT!  That's my advice for today, be like me.

      This is a transcript of a little chat I had with Parison about the blatantly unjust occurence that.... occured while I was playing Morrowind.  For those of you who don't know Morrowind is a deeply immersive RPG (Role playing game), in which you do the whole save the world thing and then you can do whatever the hell you want.  I've been playing for a while, and I have quite a suite of arms and armor, and this little story that I recounted to Parison (which I was too lazy to write up in full short story mode) is about how part of that suite was wrongly taken from me.   ADAMBOMB5060:  I... am pissed  bucky7588:  i...am tired  bucky7588:  why  ADAMBOMB5060:  i was just playing bloodmoon  bucky7588:  hurry cuz im going to bed  ADAMBOMB5060:  which is the morrowind expansion  bucky7588:  mhm  ADAMBOMB5060:  i clubbed a guy with my mace cuz he was in my way  bucky7588:  haha yes  ADAMBOMB5060:  so it was like, "your crime has been reported"  bucky7588:  ...  ADAMBOMB5060:  then a while after, I had completely forgotten about the whole thing, and I went to a fort and talked to some lady  bucky7588:  mhm  ADAMBOMB5060:  she was like, "you're under arrest"  bucky7588:  hahahaha  ADAMBOMB5060:  so it gave me the usual choices  ADAMBOMB5060:  pay gold, go to jail or resist arrest  ADAMBOMB5060:  I payed, of course, it would get me in the least trouble  bucky7588:  mhm  ADAMBOMB5060:  you know what she did?  bucky7588:  killed you?  ADAMBOMB5060:  no  ADAMBOMB5060:  im invincible  bucky7588:  raped ypu  bucky7588:  *you  ADAMBOMB5060:  not that either  ADAMBOMB5060:  she took...  bucky7588:  an anal probe?

      I'm giving in to peer pressure and updating... Those of you who aren't into video games, this probably won't interest you.  THEIF: DEADLY SHADOWS!!!!  Awesome, awesome game, go to Gamespot right now and check out the PC version.  If you like stealth action games... well, don't buy it, because there isn't a large amount of action.  Buy it if you like hiding in a shadowy corner until the right time to come out and stab a guy in the back, or club them and drag them into a shadowy spot so the body is hidden.  One time I clubbed a guy and put his body in a large chest in another room, that was fun.  I've heard of really weird kills, like putting an oil slick at the top of a flight of stairs, then watching the guard slip on it and fall down the stairs.  Then there's always the noisemaker arrow, which you can use to lure guards into traps... Oh, and don't get it if you have a crappy computer, which is everyone who reads this blog.

      My 2 cents at 10:30 -  If you're lost, don't know who you are or where you're going, ask you're friends, they have the answers because chances are, they know you better than you do.

      I thought I'd publicly humiliate Pete by posting the picture I took of him after he collapsed on my floor and didn't stop laughing for 5 minutes.  This was apparently due to the movie popcorn we ate and the miniscule amount of caffeine in his orange soda...

      I think that I now qualify for the nerdiest injusry award.  I cut my finger on my graphics card while pulling the power supply cable out of my hard drive.  It was very painful, remember that!  The danger in screwing with the parts in computers is not screwing something up, or getting electrocuted, it's cutting your finger on a graphics card.  Anyway, I was walkin home, and Pete, you'll appreciate this, there's a lot of construction on my walk home, 4 houses to be exact.  So at one house, there's all these construction dudes building stuff.  As usual, all their shirts were off, nothing unusual about that.  They had a radio, nothing unusual about that either, but the radio was playing something like John Mayer.  Needless to say, it was the most blatantly homosexual scene I have encountered in all my years.

      WOW, the physics in Unreal Tournament 2004 are so awesome.  I was driving around in my little assault buggy, this guy fires a rocket at me. The rocket hits the buggy dead on and stops it dead, but doesn't blow it up.  Instead, my inertia forces me out of the driver's seat, hitting a bar on the way that cuts me clean in half.  The upper half of my body flies up in the air, while the camera follows the other half which is still flying straight forward out of the buggy.

      SkAaAaAa... Listen to it.  A sample of lyrics, although Ska music itself is better than its lyrics...  Catch 22 Wine Stained Lips  You said you'd always be there for me You said you'd always be in my life Now you're chasing dragons instead They told me I was chasin the moon I should have listened up I'm a fool A fool tangled up in your web  All for the taste of some wine stained lips 200 miles just to get my fix This shouldn't be, it shouldn't be You're bringin me down and I need to get some sleep  9 miles to happiness I know because I've been there before 9 miles to happiness I got somethin to live for  Tell me old friend Did you find what you were lookin for? I'd like to tell you that without you I'm so happy I could die  All for the taste of some wine stained lips 200 miles just to get my fix This shouldn't be, it shouldn't be You're bringin me down and I need to get some sleep  9 miles to happiness I know because I've been there before 9 miles to happiness I got somethin to live for  It seems that I can't count All the roads that I've been down And it seems that I can't count All the towns that I've drowned in and burned to the ground  Oh what a find when I found this place So full of style And second hand love so incredibly cheap I stayed for nine months and I stayed for nine weeks  9 miles to happiness I know because I've been there before 9 miles to happiness I got somethin to live for

      You know what strikes me as funny...  I just saw a commercial for those things that have like classic arcade Pac Man or Dig Dug on them and the massive joystick with the big shiny red button.  Number 1, those things are in like 6" x 6" boxes, and they used to be in these massive arcade machines. Second, the originals probably cost the developers a few hundred dollars a piece to make, and now the little things probably cost like $30.  Third, when they first came out, there was no ESRB to rate the games E, T, M or AO, now, the ESRB has to rate these games, who would honestly be like, "Oh, I think Dig Dug is too violent for my children."  None of those games could ever get a rating higher than E, because of their graphics.  Also, you know how ESRB works?  The developer sends in scenes of the most extreme moments in their games, then a panel of parents and teachers and doctors and such rates it based on those.  I can just imagine the "extreme video" they got for pack man, or pong for that matter.

      I'm updating! How cool is that? &nbsp; Anyway, I was on Warcraft 3 online, and I'm playing a game and this guy starts lagging.&nbsp; He says, "damn pop ups", so I say, "it's called adaware."&nbsp; Then some douche&nbsp;decides to try to argue that adaware doesn't stop pop ups, and in good old online PC game style, he says, "adaware deosnt stp popups, fag."&nbsp; (the typos were intentional to&nbsp;strengthen the impact of&nbsp;my point) &nbsp; So, then I say, "Adaware removes adware, which in turn stops pop ups, and if the pop ups came from a website, and not adware, he would have&nbsp;lagged out and left&nbsp;already." &nbsp; And of course, the&nbsp;douche says, "Are you done talking?" &nbsp; So I sat there, put my face in my hands, shook my head and sighed.&nbsp; Fags often know what they're talking about, it seems.

      People, calm down, I know I have an adoring fan base here, but I couldn't update.  I was in Michigan for a week... anyway, as my new title says, I'm back... bitches.  So... in Michigan, I went to this carnival, did some bumper cars, and I saw enough trailer trash to last me a lifetime.  Anyway, there was a 12-year-old-looking girl, and I swear she was pregnant.  Oh yes, and the mystery is solved, I know where all the mullets went.  On a side note, the funnel cakes were good.  I got a shake from MacDonald's, I'm pretty sure they found a way to put grease in it.  Oh, Chicago, I went there too, that was cool.  The highways are always crouded there, they've got like 12 lanes (6 in each direction) and 2 express lanes that change direction depending on traffic flow.  BUT THERE'S STILL TRAFFIC JAMS!  I swear, we left Chicago at 3:00 PM and it was like we were in the height of rush hour, then again, that's what it was like the day before passing by the city, and heading into the city and passing by the day we left.
