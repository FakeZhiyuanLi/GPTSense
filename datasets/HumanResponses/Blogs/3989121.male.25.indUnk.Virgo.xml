						   Well it's not the end of the world at all, and in fact by eating smaller lighter meals my stomach is less bloated. I am happily wearing my favourite jeans as a result without the discomfort I had just a week ago, which is great! But the problem is that I have let myself down on some of my basic intentions - I have had alcohol, and a chocolate milkshake, and I have missed a cycling session. I need to do an hour of exercise today or tomorrow to get Week One back on track - today I am knackered (from working a bar shift last night) and tomorrow is gonna be a busy day... Maybe I should knock the excuses on the head then, actually I think I am talking myself into going for a run. Right! New plan for this afternoon - a healthy snack, because I have had no lunch today, just that evil milkshake, then a nap, tidy the flat and then go for a half hour run. Wooo!  My archives of Mens Health have revealed some pretty useful info so I'll put that into practice as of next week. In fact the last one I bought had a special feature on 6 Packs so I'm going to follow their advice pretty tightly.  At the moment I can only see a limited improvement, and absolutely no signs of any muscles. Still, it's early days, and I hope that by next Wednesday, photo day there will be a detectable difference!

						   I have been promising myself a six pack stomach for about 5 years. This blog is going to be a journal of my latest attempt
