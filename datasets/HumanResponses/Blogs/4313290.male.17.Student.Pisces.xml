      i questioned the entire foundation of some of my freindships. One of my conclusions is that i am more committed to my freinds than they are to me. ok, not including inviting me places, or getting me birthday presents, or hanging out with me, or letting me use your stuff. where is the excitement to see me? where were all ur calls this week? i called you. when i say i cant accompany you on ur trip, do you wish i could come, did you beg me to find a way to come. I beg you to play hockey, to simply stay out another hour longer, do i want you around more than you want me to be around?  so i had another good day at work. i get comments alot, people who notice things about me. things sometimes i know i do, things sometimes i dont know i do. i try to do the right thing all the time, i guess, not because i want people to see me doing it, because i want them to let me do more things, i want them to see i have mastered my responsibilities, so give me more. I have never been more passionate about something than i am for my job. i punched out at 845 tonight, then stayed and watched and helped the nurses in the ER do shit for two hours. I just want to see the stuff, i'm not impressing anyone, i just would rather learn about that stuff, the stuff i think i love, then like go otu and feel uncomfertable with confused friends, non individuals i sometimes think they are.  i migth sound like an asshole. i guess people who expect freindship from migth thik i'm an asshole based on what i'm saying. i just am tired of ten people grouping up, pretending to be friends, i know some people dont like others in our group. there are three people i dont like int he group, i'm honest, and i act upon my beliefs. it sort of puts me out though, if they all want to hang out. two of these people have fucking magical curse spells over two of my good friends, and i guess sometimes theyd rather hang together tahn with me. its fine, i dont complain (too much to people) but is it too much to ask for my best friends to bail out on all their other shit to come help me when i need them. Ur a fool to think i wouldnt drop every damn thing i'm holding to go see a freind in need, i friend who i care about and who cares for me.  so my friends want to hang out with the girls. thats cool, go ahead, i just cant do it anymore because i dont feel attached. i'd rather watch a movie with a new friend or play shooter games with someone i can relate too, or chill in a store with someone i have emotional history with, then hang out in a group of confused, flirty, addicted, like "can't live without friends," people who i dont really have alot in common with it seems. i mean, i went to the warped tour with a friend and he didnt get into the shit with me once, not even like to the band we both fucking love. Do you even love them?  things are becoming clear. theres hope for an individual.

       so i guess i'm really focused on work. when shit seems to be going awry, all i think about is making sure i'll be able to go to work, or at work things will be better. whatever, its a place of retreat, of safety. i developed a new political philosophy. its influences come from the ideas or  Marx ,  Locke , and  Jefferson . Marx was a marxist, he said that all wealth comes from labor, and he's right. maybe dad says though that it takes a creative person, who takes a risk, to start that business, and he's right. but i believe industry emerges as it is demanded, so that initial creative, risk taking, business starter will come inevitably, and huge wealth cannot be made without a huge infrastructure, and that takes labor. then...Locke said that a just government should, and only sould, protect the "life, liberty, and property" of those over which it governs. This is true too, and it should do no more, because when it starts developing socialistic programs, not all benefit equally, and in fact some dont benefit at all, and in super fact, some are hurt by this (the wealthy) because they pay their taxes so that others (sometimes they deserve it, but many dont) can get what they need. anyway, government programs are a different topic, but thats what i extract from the teachings of Locke. then there is jefferson, third president, idealistic scholar. he believed there should be routine revolutions, continuously changing, checking, and improving the system. I think its time that people realize just how dramatically the role of our government has changed, how much closer its come to the soviet union than it originally was intended to be a conglomeration of x number of states, each strongly independent of the rest, yeilding to a federally enforced constitution. anyway so to tie it all up, from Marx you have labor, and i say, let the labor keep all it makes, let people keep all their wealth, and let them manage their own lives, whether they end up dying somehow (irresponsibility). if they manage themselves, those who are responsible will survive, bang, a strong population. From Locke, a government that protects the life, liberty, and property of the governed. let the people form their own protective structure, let them join in a social contract with themselves, to ensure their protection of these things, let them invest in it themselves, and let those who dont want to be apart of it fend for themselves. let these people then manage it, not millionare politicians who become senators and presidents to protect their businesses. And from Jerfferson, the people must work together, care for their nation, care for themselves and their self interest, and each other, the people, the working people, the thinkers, the soldiers,  they all must depend on each other, and they should form their own protective body, which serves only the purposes proposed by Locke, and they should pay their leaders only a little, to ensure that only the most loyal-to-ideas people take office. in history, we've seen socialist revolutions, i cant think of many linertarian revolutions, lets at least try one. girls are kind of annoying, they tell secrets and stuff right as ur watching and then dont talk to you, show some interst if you are interested!!! i watched a movie with winson, requiem for a dream, it was awesome and sad but really good.
