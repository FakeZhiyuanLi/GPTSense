      So like any day, after lunch for a few mins I was /.ing and I came across this link, urlLink Popular Science | Mind Over Machine , it's a ways off before a full-fledged link that'll let you drive by thought...
 
  
 Last few songs I listened to:   Paul Simon- Spirit Voices
 Cat stevens- the Wind
 Oingo Boingo-Dead Man's Party
 Peggy Lee- How long has this been going on
 Cake - Comfort Eagle
 NIN- piggy
 tool-opiate
 Sex Pistols- God Save the Queen
 Tragically Hip- Hockey Song
 Billy Joel- For the longest time
 Simon &amp; Garfunkle-Mrs Robinson
 Sublime(feat Pharcyde)- Summertime
 REM-Drive
 BNL- Brian Wilson (acoustic)
   
Till then my plan is to go with near eye displays or heads up displays on sunglasses,  with an ultraportable computer, ala  urlLink antelope ,  urlLink tiqit ,the elusive vaporware  urlLink OQO , which BTW comes with the newest pre-release version of duke nukem, or now the brand new must have vaporware handtop the  urlLink flipstart .   
Okay now let me say that I realize that this is kind of ridiculous given that a sizable portion of the world has difficulty meeting it's basic needs, but I digress... 
Any of these would be great, yet none of them exist (with the exception of antelope) and when they do they'll be too expensive, so till the're in my range...I have my palm (m500) for notes, contacts, and it syncs with my corporate calendar, I have my phone for calling, email, and text messaging (nokia 3300 mp3s too, but...), my ipod (15g 3rd genmy new favorite toy), my camera for pix (fuji A101), and for work files an external hd (arcdisc 2.0, usb2, 20g)
 I crave convergence, or a scott evest, these days my cargo pants weigh about 5 extra lbs, and my bag is filled with enough dongles to choke a wood chipper.  But is it even a good idea to have all of that in one device(what if I loose it, or what if it crashes).  Is it  just better to have a few specialized devices that do things well. My top three in terms of everyday functionality/desire phone, palm, music player, but I'd love to have a lightweight camera that could store on a large drive, divx video with that'd be great, and I may as well add games, right?

      You'd think as an early adopter I'd have jumped on the blog bandwagon a lot earlier, but for years the blogs I tracked were interesting and topic specific funny, or  noteworthy in some way.  But it's been a long time since blogs were about all of that, so here I am, one of the masses contributing to the slurry of text that is out there.      my playlist today:  
 cure-lovecats
 frank zappa-valley girl
 Cream-crossroads
 Diana Krall- frim fram sauce
 Stereolab- Super Falling Star
 Hoverphonic-Wicky
 Kinks- all day and all of the night
 Kid Loco- going aorund in circles
 Beck - Tropicalia
 Cibo Matto- flowers
 Aerosmith-sweet emotion
 Led Zeppelin - fool in the rain
 Clapton- Layla(original)
 lou reed-walk on the wild side
 Ramones- I wanna be sedated
 Andres Segovia- Chacone
 Lo Fi Allstars-BattleFlag
 Belle and Sebastian- Step in to my office
 Yeah Yeah Yeahs- Bang 
Using: 15 Gig ipod 3rd gen
 
 
So here's the last several songs in my rotation if anyone's reading this and you have recomendations/suggestions please post em.  This is it for my first blog entry, and the others will be much like this, little  or no point, but you might find a new (or old) song worth listening to.

       Spring (Allergy causing Pollen) is in the air 
   
 Classic Rock Playlist   Jimi Hendrix- Fire
 Cream- White Room
 Black Sabbath- Crazy Train
 AC/DC- Back in Black
 Led Zeppelin- Whole Lotta Love
 Ram Jam- Black Betty
 Steppenwolf- Magic Carpet Ride
 Foghat-Radar Love

 Jefferson Airplane- White Rabbit

   
 So  for no particular reason I decided I was in a classic rock kinda mood.  Don't really have much to say in this post.  My life is fairly free of drama and intrigue. So I will leave you with the following inspirational email from my aunt
  
One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The
animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried
to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the
animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up
anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the
donkey. 

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help
him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel
dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what
was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's
amazement he quieted down. 

A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked
down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With
each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was
doing something amazing. He would shake it off and
take a step up. 

As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on
top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a
step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the
donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and
happily trotted off! 

Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of
dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake
it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a
stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells
just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off
and take a step up. 

  after the inspirational crap, we join the farmer and his
donkey a week later.. 

The pissed off donkey came back and bit the shit out of 
the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the
bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in
agony from septic shock. 
 
 MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON: 
When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass,
it always comes back to bite you.

       Rockin out 
   
 Punkish   The Sex Pistols- God Save the Queen
 The Yeah Yeah Yeahs- Bang
 The White Stripes- Fell in Love with a Girl
 The Ramones- Blitzkrieg Bop
 The Strokes- Hard to Explain
 Jet- Are You Gonna Be My Girl
 The Vines- Get Free
 The Clash- London Calling
 Rancid- Time Bomb
 The Offspring- Come out and Play
 The Vandals- Pirate's life
 The Ataris- Your Boyfriend Sucks

   This is a pretty good playlist to rock out to.  It really works for a nice sunny day.  Generally speaking I'm not a huge punk fan, but how can you not love the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the new bands that imitate the classics.  The vandals and ataris songs on the list are just there because they're new aquisitions, I don't think thye'll slip into heavy rotation on my list anytime soon.  If anyone reading this( does anyone read this?) has any punk recommendations based on the stuff up there, email em out to me. hkarmark(at )cal.berkeley.edu (written out to avoid spiders for spammers)

Brilliant flash  urlLink bubblewrap  for relieving stress in your cube, and it requires way less space/flexibility than yoga.  So it has come to the point where nearly all of my links are coming from my aunt.  I no longer have to scour the web for unusual sites or little tools because she aggregates them for me, and unlike fark they are delivered to my mailbox every morning.  So I have decided to find a couple good ones of my own so I feel less like an aggregator and more like a collector.  I'd just like to give a shout-out to an acquaintance from school, Anthony Levandowski, who has entered in the Barstow to Las Vegas robot race with, get this, a  urlLink  robotic motorcycle (scroll down to get to levandowski), trying to solve a problem much tougher than a segway.

So it is a beautifull day out here in Palo Alto, 75 degrees, crystal clear air, gorgeous sun.  The kind of day that makes one want to play hookie and throw around the frisbee, or hit the beach.  Man am I glad my office has a window.  In honor of this first truly gorgeous day this year I've tossed together a little summery playlist to groove to.  There were many more songs I wanted to add, but well, the playlist takes up a lot of real estate.  So here's a flash animation from the past come back to haunt us  urlLink Gonads and Strife  when flash animations were crude, choppy and hilarious.  If you don't already do so regularly, hit up strongbad emails at  urlLink homestar runner  it's worth it to go back a while and get to know the characters but beware, it can eat up lots of time

Last night I was at work well after midnight working on a demo when california dreamin came on my ipod playlist.  Thinking about LA made me feel happy because the weather is wonderful, and the people are better looking.  So I decided to make today my LA day,I decided to dress well, and slap a thin veneer of  charm and courtesy over the knee deep pool of sleep deprivation I am wading through (ya know, kind of like that waiter who doesn't like you, but is trying to decide if you're someone he should waste an 8x10 glossy on, cause you might be important).  I think it's worked pretty well so far, but man I don't know how people keep it up.  O yeah, also there's a big email virus going around (Netsky) actually a worm because it contains it's own smtp, it sends attachments (usually .pif's) often zipped, often claiming you need some password to access the archive.  The from field is spoofed so don't bother contacting the sender.  If you think you have it click one of the following links  urlLink  network associates ,  urlLink  symantec  (my preference);

 My  playlist today was inspired by two things, 1.) I woke up feeling great, and 2.) pop music is intruding on my life, I cannot escape the american idol pop sensation...William Hung.  Yes I am talking about Civ E superstar William "She Bangs" Hung.  A charismatic singer with no professional training and as many have seen in his video excerpts, "no regrets".  Okay so he's terrible, but you've got to give him credit for being super ballsy and for being/playing ignorant  to the fact that the entire nation is mocking him.  This guy is huge, just see how he fares on a google  urlLink  search .  For a while he was the second highest rated story on MSN, hell, people in Idaho know who he is.  William Hung, I salute you.

So I was feeling a real 92-95 kinda vibe today for some reason, so I thought I'd take the ipod off random and put together a little playlist of appropriate songs. These are the last few that came up, If only I had long hair and a flannel, the vibe would be complete.  That and 3.75'll get me some of seattle's best coffee to drown my angst in.

     So , I've been pretty bummed out the past few days (for obvious reasons if you've been talking to me lately), but this morning on the way to work that changed.  I saw an accident that resulted in a bad car fire and two ambulances on the scene.  Based on the configuration of the accident, the flaming car was making the same turn I was about to when it got nailed.  It suddenly occurred to me that regardless of how stressed or bummed I am, at least I'm not on fire in an intersection on the way to work.  My outlook on the day did a complete 180, after all it's sunny and gorgeous outside, and while I have 34 test cases ahead of me at work today, I won't be thinking about them from a burn ward.  It's a shame it took a possible fatality to slap a little perspective into me, but I'll take what I can get.

     Woke up this morning feeling amazing, like I had skill and power somewhere between a ninja and a jedi.  Which is surprising after I spent last night consuming a pasta bowl of obscene proportions that was supposed to last me through the week.   Mom, I love your arrabiata.    Feeling carnivorous I added about a half pound of chopped up greasy pork italian sausage into the bowl. I ate a good 8-10 servings of pasta and a bag of trader joes haricot vert.  After about an hour I experienced a food coma that actually caused me to black out.  I slept like a baby ...a baby that had been hit on the head by a few pounds of spicy pasta.  So I thought I would share some of my ninja feelings with you.  Feeling hungry want food delivered by silent assasins?  urlLink Try ninja-burger  I highly recommend the fries of their glorious ancestors.

The best feeling keyboard I have ever used before ( the apple extended keyboard) has been resurrected using the same mechanical keyswitches as the original.  This keyboard is huge and noisy, but has an excellent feel and keystroke depth.  They only give it a five year warranty, but at home the family has a couple of the adb originals that are well on their way to being adults(18 that is) and still working great.  If you are a mac user I strongly recommend that you get one of these

     For   a number of reasons I woke up in  a dark mood today.  Yesterday I had a discussion with a co worker about morons who take no personal responsibility and sue fast food joints for getting fat.  When did it become okay to blame other people for your own failings or stupidity.  Because of idiots and their slimy lawyers we have warnings about putting ladders on soft ground, warnings about over exertion for starting lawn mowers, and now soon warnings on fries.  "Surgeon General's warning, these fries have been shown to make your ass bigger."   We're quickly running out of selection mechanisms, so I guess it was my sudden desire for a selective wave of idiot seeking death that inspired the playlist.  Of course it's easy for me to say all of this, not having any real problems in my life, but if you couldn't figure out that eating nothing but cheeseburgers was gonna make you fat, not seeing your feet is the least of your problems. But then again we all know what happens if you get rid of all of the telephone sanitizers (the answer is 42).

     So  this post has recently been edited since it first went up, because really, my life's  much better than the old post version would have led one to believe.   While I can't shake that naked eyes lyric, cause there  is  always something there to remind me,  I'm really doing qute well now. I guess my current mindset is best described by Gyppo Lou's historic quote to a cute scientologist in Miyagi's (which will soon be appearing on a t-shirt in my cafe press shop, with 1/2 net (initial)proceeds going to lou for saying it with a straight face).

 Many  may wonder why I have selected this playlist of funk and soul.  There is but one answer, and it came to George Clinton straight out of the pyramids: "Funk is its own reward." Every once in a while I feel that it is important to take a step back from the drudgery of our lives and embrace the funk.  Many of my good friends have also taken this to heart like former disco vigilante Tom Berman a.k.a the impresario of Funk, Ryan Salcedo the Funky Fish(founder of the Earth, Wind, & Fire tribute band "Water"), or Nick Hinkell who eats, sleeps, breathes, and skates the funk every day.  So the next time today someone asks you to acknowledge something respond in your best baritone with an "I dig", or a "Damn straight," unless they be jive'n in which case you can tell 'em what the five fingers said to the face

    This playlist is dedicated to my buddy Brian's first car.  Her name was Veronica she was a silver 1985 Nissan 300ZX t-top.  Brian was the first one of us in highschool with his own car so he drove us around alot.  Without Veronica we would have missed out on many of the antics that made the highschool so much fun. I'm putting this up today because I saw a Z today that looked exactly what veronica must have in her prime. We all miss her, but I bet Tommy misses her the most.  urlLink  Basically what she looked like   In the end she was running on 3 cylinders and had to go, but she was still a sweet car.  In her honor, I may have to get a G35 coupe in silver for my next car.

       The Driving Date, it's you and me and the car makes 3 
   
A lot of people hate driving around in LA with a passion, but when I was sixteen and broke it was all there really was to do (check the blog archives for my ode to Veronica).  LA's got a lot of great things to do and see,  but no cohesive downtown like New York or San Francisco. We have freeways connecting everything, so from one attraction to the other there's a lot of driving to be done.  This fosters a kind of love/hate relationship with the one's car and streets of the city.  I thought I'd look a little bit more on the love side of the scale since I'm trapped up in silicon valley where it's just plain different (I suppose it's like  the  valley with less burger joints, less sushi, less porn, and a lot more tech) The great thing about LA driving is the scenery, it's tough to beat the LA variation from city to beach to oilfields to canyons, while never being more than 10 minutes from an in-n-out or a fatburger. A driving date is something you can really only do with someone who gets it.  But for those who do understand, there just something compelling about cruising around on a sunny day,windows down, roof open and good music blasting.   I've always liked it because it's pretty cheap, and all you need to make it work is a date that's up for it and decent loop.  I personally like the trip from mulholland to malibu canyon, to piuma (the overlook is a good place to stop and picnic), back out to PCH, grab drinks and dinner in santa monica and close off the loop in west LA, but the city's full of good ones.  So for any angelinos reading this, throw your favorite drive loop into the comments

       urlLink manybooks.net - Free eBooks for your PDA   
 Lately  I've taken to downloading ebooks for my palm, and carying my palm with me whenever I know I might be waiting somewhere for a while.  Project Gutenberg is a great way of getting tons of free texts that I should have read by now.  What I really need is a good epaper (for the reduced eyestrain), ebook reader with a digital pen that lets me annotate books and save my annotations in a seperate file that can be loaded over the ebook text.  

If the big publishers came together with a few platform companies and got a general standard ebook format decided on, the rest of the software vendors would follow.  Granted the standard would end up being strongarmed by microsoft and palm most likely, but at least then there'd be one general standard.  It would have to allow for freeform pagination because of different display sizes and preferences, but it would be really easy to have some xml based format, or just require that ebooks follow one specific xml schema and then let vendors parse them however the hell they like.  

I can envision myself in 5 years going to a kiosk at an airport bookstore, slotting an sd card in and picking up the newest clancey type junkfood bestseller.  I'd never carry a paperback again

       The OS, then the browser,then the portal, now what? 
   So Yahoo has now responded to the ludicrous amount of gmail storage by upping their accounts to 100mb.  One has to wonder how long it will be before microsoft will step up to the plate and deliver a better free email service.  The real power with delivery of information is controlling the channel. 10 years ago that meant controlling the desktop, 5 years ago that meant controlling the browser, now it's controlling the content delivery channels to deliver targeted content/ads.  Between MSN, Yahoo, Google, and the dying aol, Google is quickly becoming the 500lb gorilla with the best search engine, the best email, the best news search, the entire usenet archives, a blogging service (this one), and an affiliated social/business networking community ( orkut).  Granted MSN and yahoo have their answers to most of these, but by coming in later as player with a less commercial and stronger technical reputation, I certainly trust google more.  MSN and Yahoo come off as pushing content too much, through google I search what's out there and get a less biased view of things.  My one gripe is that google has decided not to bundle services under one login, but to provide most services as standalones.  It would be nice to have one login/session for orkut, gmail, and blogger, but since I managed to land the same username for all I guess I'm happy

 So  the last week or so has been interesting, I saw a couple old friends and exes I haven't seen in a while.  I went to a kickass "A Perfect Circle" concert.  I attended a birthday party of someone who I had never met before the party.  Kobe hit a clutch 3 tonight so the lake-show could win it in overtime.  Today I found out that I will probably be doing a month or two stint in Melbourne for work, great opportunity, but man 2 months on the other side of the world.  It's a good thing I'm single

       My buddy Ali's family lives in Sydney, so he offered me the guestroom for the weekend and his services as tour guide, how could I refuse.  Friday night we got in from the airport and went directly to an upscale bar filled with well dressed good looking people, think NYC with nicer people.  After a couple hours at the bar we hit drove through the extremely seedy kings cross (crackheads and prostitutes lining the sidewalks) to Harry's Cafe de Wheels for a bite.  Harry's has been around in Sydney for ages, it's a little trailer in a seedy part of town that's open late and serves tasty food to defile the temple of the body.  I had a chicken pie toppped with mashed potatoes and cheese sauce, and what they called a chilli cheese dog.  A harry's chilli cheese dog is bizzare, it's a hot dog with mashed peas (yes, mashed peas), onions,  chili, hot sauce, and this bechamel looking "cheese sauce".  Lemme tell ya, after a bunch of drinks it was delicious.  The next day I took the ferry to Manly, got a great view of the city from the harbor and walked around.  Went to the gym, then went out again.  Sydney has this casino that looks great on the outside, and looks like the stardust on the inside.  Ali's friend was celebrating her 29th, so we celebrated by going to this club in the casino with a bar that overlooked the casino floor.  80's music, and neat 'fiddich's for $6US, suffice to say, a good time was had by all.  The next day was a little more sight seeing and recovery, then back to the office.

       urlLink Metails.com  is what happened when someone sat down and said friendster is great, but how can I use it's model to make lots and lots of money. This idea is great, a user comes on and looks through groups of friends and foafs to find out what's cool, when something catches the user's eye s/he clicks the link and is taken directly to the online retailer that sells it ( mostly to amazon). The site and the person with the link both take a slice off the top and everyone's happy. I don't think I'll join, despite the fact that it's genius. What annoys me the most about this site is that I didn't come up with it. If this thing were to get to friendster size ( and it won't), the people running it could make obscene amounts of money. Something like this could really catch on and be powerful in Japan where there is a huge culture of social status based on having the right stuff. The real questions are how can it be done better, how can they possibly protect themselves from copycats, and how could they collect and sell marekting datato really leverage the network.

      The joys of seeking validation or  humiliation from random people on the internet.  I had a conversation about my looks with a recent acquaintance who shall remain namless, and we disagreed on my position in the absolute  (national, not LA or bay area) 10pt scale.  In order to settle this dispute we agreed to turn to the ultimate scoring medium, hotornot.com, using the only picture I seem to use online (as seen on this page, friendster, and orkut) .  Feel free to click the following  urlLink link ,  but vote honestly,  a wager of drinks rests on the outcome after 200 people have rated me.  Have no worries,  I will neither be crushed nor get a swelled head, afterall, I know what I look like

      The Sofitel Melbourne is a sweet hotel, tonight I got back to my room and found strawberries, chocolate, and a chilled bottle of white wine with a note from the management saying "hope your project goes well."&nbsp;&nbsp; At first I found it cool, and then it sunk in that it had this kind of unintended backhanded feel to it.&nbsp; The note may as well have said "we're giving you a gift cause you're here for so long, but we're rubbing it in that you'll be drinking this by yourself in front of a computer tonight ,if you get to drink it at all, oh and here's two glasses just as a reminder."&nbsp; Good thing I'm bloody bold, and resolute. ( I saved the wine for a less depressing chance to crack it, but I was all over the strawberries like a fat kid on a cupcake)

       urlLink Lions steamroll Pies (July 17, 2004)   Today I went out and saw my first footy game.  It was  cold and raining at the Melbourne Cricket Grounds, and the game started close and low scoring.  The match was almost tied at the half, but starting in the third quarter Brisbane Lions had their way with the Collingwood Magpies.  Aussie rules football is a great brutal sport and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  It's got all the elements that make a sport exciting to watch, fast paced action, high scoring potential, feats of skill and luck, and a healthy dose of violence.  It may be my new favorite spectator sport.

       urlLink Behold, it warms!! 
Other than work and meals not much has happened so far in my melbourne trip, but I will still share some of the day2-day5 highlights.
For breakfast the other day I grabbed an awful vegemite sandwich just to say I've had one.   Melbourne seems to be a great city for food, despite the vegemite.  Night before last I had crocodile with scallions, ginger, and snowpeas at a chinese place, and last night I had a tandoori chicken pizza with a mint raita on top, the food here has treated me well.  To replace the usual greeting of " 'sup?" I've picked up "How you going?" to which I guess the response is "great."  I've also finally made real use of orkut and friendster to find out good places to eat and drink in Melbourne (many thanks to the orkut groups: melbourne foodies and melbourne, and also to the friendster user Miss Kate).  This trip is working out pretty well, now we just have to get the deal :)

       Work and getting around  
    
Today was my second day of work in melbourne. Began the day with a "long black" (kind of a double americano, easy on the water) and a bacon egg and cheese muffin. I'm really begining to dig this city, on the walk from my hotel ( melbourne sofitel) down collins street to work the melbourne feels like a cross between a european city and somewhere in the east coast. The europe part comes in with the walkable clean alleys and random interesting stuff: I walked by a shop where instead of mannequins in the display window they had a group of co-ed models in underwear dancing lip synching to YMCA. Work was a hard productive 11 hour day with a Pho break for lunch, and afterwards we closed the day with a great tapas dinner. I could get used to this lifestyle.

        Where women glow and men plunder 
Finally after much deliberation, the details of my australia trip have been settled. From the 10th to the 28th of July, I will be  in Melbourne programming up a storm, possibly having a vb or two, and augmenting my speach with such gems as mate, and no worries.  If anyone has suggestions of things to do in Melbourne, or any friends in the city please leave a comment.

      Today, thanks to the overwhelming jet lag, I was up in time for the sunrise, but all I caught was marine layer. It's good to be back in socal for a day or two to sleep and enjoy the spectacular weather. I'm gonna milk this day for all that it's worth, I'va already got a lacma trip planned, and maybe I'll even swing by the getty. I've still got a brutal cough from my travels down under, but the heat and a fatburger should cure what ails me.  Oh yeah, and check my  urlLink moblog  for a few random pics from my trip, including the Cafe deWheels chilli dog.

      This trip to australia has definitely had its share of highlights of good days, but 24 days on a work trip can wear.  Melbourne is a great city of little bars and cafes tucked in side streets and alleyways, it's got a very european feel and it's not unusual to see people having a drink at lunchtime.  The reason why  is simple, the weather here blows.  Great city, but the weather is like Seattle.  Sydney  has more of a rushed big city feel and the people aren't as nice, but they are better looking and the weather's significantly better.  Sydney vs. Melbourne  seems to be athe LA vs. SF rivalry, except Melbourne has more of a european feel than SF.  So, day after tomorrow I go back to the states to grab a  little slice of  summer which seems to have mostly passed in my time down under, but it's been a hell of a trip.  It's amazing how much you can learn in the field , "heaps" of hard work but it's been worth it.
