       Last night I went to the ATM, to see if I had enough cash to get to the Zutons show at Iota.       I didn't.    I had...  $8.32   in my account.      Not quite a debt-related story, but were I not so awful with money and were my bills not so high, I would have had more in the bank.      It's all relative.

        My name is  Megan , and  I too am in debt .      I don't have the exact figures, but it pretty much goes a little something like this:       *student loans:    approx.   $8000   (down from about $10000 right after graduation!)    *mastercard:    approx .   $4000    (rapidly approaching the land of maxed out cards)    *l&t, nordstrom:    we'll say...  $3500   (this might be a bit high)    *PLUS     I   owe my mother lots of money. Conservative estimates could place this at about      $5000     That makes my approximate grand debt total...  $20,500.00         That is a big number.

       Perfection = amazing song inspired by an amazing poem...     Observe.       &nbsp;     I wander thro' each charter'd street,       Near where the charter'd Thames does flow       And mark in every face I meet       Marks of weakness, marks of woe.        In every cry of every Man,       In every Infants cry of fear,       In every voice; in every ban,       The mind-forg'd manacles I hear        How the Chimney-sweepers cry       Every blackning Church appalls,       And the hapless Soldiers sigh       Runs in blood down Palace walls        But most thro' midnight streets I hear       How the youthful Harlots curse       Blasts the new born Infants tear       And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse      The poem is  London,  by one of my favorite poets/artists William Blake. Hundred of years later, Richard Ashcroft from The Verve was inspired to write the gorgeous song  History,  which can be found on the album A Northern Soul.      Read Blake. Listen to the Verve. Thank me later.

       It is pouring.     &nbsp;  As much as I really don't like rain itself, I adore the smell of rain. Especially rain in the summer. There is something about the rain coming down in the heated air that produces a wonderful smell.     &nbsp;  I do, however, enjoy thunderstorms. Unless I am totally alone in the middle of the night and a massive storm hits. Then I am not so enthralled. But otherwise, I love the darkening sky, the threatening clouds, and the window-rattling claps of thunder.     &nbsp;  I suppose the amount of storms we get here during the summer are one good point of a swamp-like climate...

        I have Mansun on the brain. I was listening to the album Six a few weeks ago, and now Paul Draper's falsetto-lectable voice is stuck singing to me in my head.        &nbsp;     The only pureness left is preached to me by Mao, being a boy's like sucking a lemon, I could have been somebody special.           &nbsp;    Such a shame they broke up.

      &nbsp;  This is a fragment from the email Jeff sent me late last night.    "I&nbsp;remember your mix tapes you used to make me and that we could just be on the phone and say nothing. You were the only one I didn't mind doing that with."    The thing is, we actually used to sit up til the wee hours of dawn, after having been on the phone all night. The next best thing to actually being physically in each other's presence was being on the phone. And we didn't have to say anything. And it wasn't weird or awkward, or didn't happen because we had run out of things to say. I've never been able to do that with anyone else. And if there has been extended periods of silence, it was pretty much because there was nothing else to say. Odd...perhaps. But to me it speaks volumes about the comfort level we established with each other.     He also once made&nbsp;me a Tape'O'Metal, in exchange for all the Brit-popped tapes I would make for him. I actually listened to it a lot, and still have it, with the rest of the tapes I have held onto.    &nbsp;   This is all getting really weird for me.

      &nbsp;   Music for the Day: 94.7/Franz Ferdinand     It's Friday and for this I am thankful.     I've been here for almost a full half hour before I needed to be. I drove in, and amazingly there wasn't much traffic on 395. I think it took 30 minutes to get from my front door into my parking space. I managed to oversleep, which I shall blame on the weather. It's hard to want to get out of bed when the sky is seven shades of gray and the air is tremendously humid. I wanted to stay in bed and sleep, but alas I couldn't.     Had a message from Jeff awaiting me this morning. All I can say right now is that it made me very happy and very sad at the same time.     I fell asleep reading last night, how sad. I was almost done with my book (under 30 pages to go) and I really wanted to get through it but sleep overcame me and I fell asleep, book in hand.    &nbsp;  I'm getting very excited: I am going to pick up the keys for my new place tomorrow morning. It still doesn't quite feel real that I'm moving, I guess it will when the movers come by!!     Today is: TGIF. Being almost done with my book.     &nbsp;

         fuck.      I keep running into the Cute Office Boy whilst totally unprepared for it. I've seen him three times today already, and never when I am ready to see him. It is getting to be rather farcical.     &nbsp;   I don't know why I even pay attention, because he is probably 17 years old and killing time until he goes off to college (how long ago that was for me).&nbsp;     Though...he really doesn't  look  17. Maybe he's a new hire. That would be much preferred.     I've also realized that I say pretty much the same thing to everyone who calls. I even use the same tone of voice (the dreaded Phone Voice). It's higher and perkier than my normal speaking voice and it annoys even me. Yet I can't seem to stop doing it.

       Just back from lunch. It's actually not such a terribly gross day after all, though perhaps I only think this because I was sitting in the shade. Would have spent the entire hour out there reading, but I had to flee inside due to the irritatingly persistent gaze of not one but two hungry squirrels. They were absolutely adorable, but I was thinking: rabid? I tossed one of them a fry but that obviously wasn't enough to satisfy. So I retreated into our book room for the duration of my lunch.     Cheerful lunch reading: just read the part of my book discussing Sylvia Plath's suicide. I just can't imagine feeling like that was any kind of solution. Then again my husband didn't leave me to&nbsp;be with a married woman, leaving me to raise two small children. Soooo who am I to judge? It's so sad either way. She was another tortured artist...    &nbsp;

       This is the way forwards (and friendship) should be:     &nbsp;   Are you tired of all those sissy "friendship" poems that always sound good, but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that really speaks to true friendship:     &nbsp;   (1) When you are sad - I will help get you drunk and plot revengeagainst the sorry bastard who made you sad.    (2) When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.    (3) When you smile - I will know you finally got laid.    (4) When you are scared - I will rag on you about it every chance I get.    (5) When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about howmuch worse it could be and to quit whining.    (6) When you are confused - I will use small words.    (7) When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are wellagain. I don't want whatever you have!    (8) When you fall - I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.    This is my oath... I pledge it till the end. Why, you may ask? Because you are my friend.    Remember: A good friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body. Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.     &nbsp;   *fwd courtesy of Heather

       How sad this makes me. I am a huge fan of college&nbsp;football, and Eddie Robinson was one of the greatest coaches ever. But he has become yet another person living with Alzheimers.     urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1844075     If I were more awake, I would launch into some tirade about how this country needs to do more research with stem cells blah blah blah...but I don't have it in me right now. I do hope that someday people don't have to worry about this disease...    &nbsp;

        Music for the Day: The Killers - Hot Fuss      &nbsp;    Glad to be here in one piece. Someone who must have been really eager to get behind his desk this morning almost plowed into me as we played stop-and-go on 495. I heard squealing breaks and looked in my rearview and there he was, about an inch from my bumper. I don't get rattled easily behind the wheel, but that got my heart pumping a little faster. Rush-hour here sucks. Too many damn people.        &nbsp;    It is also already nice and muggy outside. But I guess that's what happens when you live in a swamp.        &nbsp;    Nothing of real import to discuss yet, so I'll just sit here blabbering on about how much I heart the Killers album. It is phenomenal. J.P. told me I would like it more&nbsp;than Franz Ferdinand, and at the time&nbsp;I scoffed, but now...I might be inclined to agree.&nbsp;It is just phenomenal. And everyone should go buy it.       Now.         &nbsp;

      &nbsp;    I should be in bed. But here I am, blogging away.        &nbsp;    Tonight was  Black Cat Wednesday . I need to get that copyrighted. Anyway. One of the least eventful BCWs ever. Heather and I sat around for a while on the skanktacular red leather couch and dished on coworkers and men and life in general. Then we left, before midnight, to avoid turning into pumpkins.        &nbsp;    In town I saw two Minis (one  yellow , one  white ). I like to imagine someday owning a Mini. I wish they had been out when I had been shopping around for a car. I'd love to have the color combination I saw at the beach...tan (perhaps tan is the wrong color. But it is late and I am tipsy and can't quite stretch my color knowledge as far as it needs to go) with black racing stripes. It was hot.        &nbsp;    I also made, for quite possibly the first time, the first traffic light upon entering the District of Columbia after coming in via 395 from Virginia. This light has been my nemesis for years, I've always missed it. But tonight, finally, I made it through while the light was still green.        &nbsp;    Here's to little triumphs...

       Burning the candle at both ends: health hazard or fun times?     &nbsp;   Kevin told me today that I was burning the candle at both ends. I guess I am. But I don't want to let go of my occasional bouts of leaving rational thought behind when it comes to going out, because when I do that I begin to feel old. Being able to go out on weeknights and drink a lot and stay out late and then get up and make it to work ontime has been a part of my life ever since I graduated college. It's been a part of my identity: for example people here at work think of me as a "good time gal" which could be used to describe me. I feel that if I give up going out during the week, that I'll have lost part of who I am.     &nbsp;   Neurotic. I know.     &nbsp;

       Music of the day: 94.7 FM (classic rock - the only station that plays music in the morn.)     &nbsp;     My tongue was this color when I crawled out of bed this morning.           &nbsp;   Be wary of delicious yet potent slurpee-esque drinks. Especially when they are full of nothing but blue food coloring and sixteen types of booze. Perhaps not really sixteen, but it feels like sixteen...     &nbsp;   I had much too much of a good time last night. I am glad I decided against going home to go to bed and went to see the Hives. The show was great. Well, apart from one of the opening bands.  Mediocrity, thy name is Sahara Hotnights.  They are the Swedish Donnas. And no, that's not a good thing. Anyway. I love the Hives. Always a Hives bridesmaid (somehow I always managed to miss their D.C. shows), I was finally a bride. They are great and they know they are great and they make the audience feel their greatness. I dug their matching Colonel Sanders ties, too. Nice. They all sport the black ensemble with white blazer and tie thing very well. From my perch upon the balcony, Hannah and I watched as Howlin' Pelle proceeded to prance, pout, schmooze, strut, shimmy, and kick. That boy really is like a Naughties version of Mick Jagger. Thankfully, though, none of the Hives look like Death Warmed Over (a.k.a. Keef Richards).     &nbsp;   I suitably liquored myself up, the more to enjoy the frenetic energy of the show. The 9:30 Club makes this wonderful wonderful drink, simply entitled the Blue Thing (easy to remember; always a good quality of a drink). It is, as mentioned above, a Slurpee-like drink. It is also very much more alcoholic than a Slurpee could ever hope to be. We'll call it the Slurpee's evil twin. And I had three. In under 2 hours. It might not seem like many, but damned if my head doesn't still feel fuzzy. Also, my tongue (and a bit of my lips) turned a nice shade of blue. And still retain a bit of blueness.     &nbsp;   Also last night I spent a good bit of time after the fabulous show having a chin-wag with lovely friend Laura. She and I don't see each other very much (bad thing) but always have a good time when we do see each other (good thing). We discussed our current crushes, and decided to try to formulate strategies to help each other attain our boys. I think that it'll be much easier for me to advise her, given that I think her boy has a crush on her. Mine, however...not so much. But that's another story entirely.     &nbsp;   So I got in bed around 1:30, in a fuzzy haze (thanks to the show and four {I had a cup of Framboise Lambic a.k.a. the Blood of Christ, which the super nice bartender gave me on the house} drinks) and after hitting my arm squarely against a wall. Yeah, I walked into a wall. Yay me. Arm is still smarting.     &nbsp;   Today is: Black Cat Wednesday. Maybe.       &nbsp;      &nbsp;

       Ralph Nader makes me angry. Very, very angry.     &nbsp;   I am all for question the validity of the two-party system, and I agree that it's broken and needs fixing. But surely there are better ways to fix it than to ruin two elections. Yes, two elections. This is exactly what will happen if Nader doesn't take himself out of the race. Dubya will get the boost of having people vote for Nader who otherwise might have voted for Kerry, just as he took votes away from Gore in 2000.     &nbsp;   And let's be real, kids. If Nader hadn't been on the ballot in Florida, there wouldn't have been a recount. His thousands of votes would most likely have gone to Gore, thereby cementing the fact that  Gore really won the election.        &nbsp;   I am amazed at the size of Nader's ego, to think that he will single-handedly be responsible for smashing the system and initiating party reform. Keep on keepin' on, but  DO NOT MAKE ME SUFFER THROUGH FOUR MORE YEARS OF DUBYA.        &nbsp;   No to Nader in 2004.       &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        Really, I will stop soon.        &nbsp;    But I wanted to interject something of literary import into my blog, before it takes the downward spiral into straight up "Dear Diary"-hood.        &nbsp;    I am currently right in the middle of my alphabetical reading journey. Some folks are familiar with this. Last July I decided I would read three books per letter of the alphabet (by author). So I began with three "A" authors, and am not more than halfway through my first "M" title. It's a bio called  Her Husband;  about the totally doomed relationship between Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. It's all rather interesting, and I felt the need to read it since a) I got it as a free galley copy while I was working at Olssons, and free reads are a wonderful thing; and b) because I don't read enough bio/autobios. I'm definitely a fiction kind of gal. It's all rather fascinating, and sad, since I know how the story ends...or at least in that I know the end result of their relationship. Poor slightly mad Sylvia commits suicide.        &nbsp;    In the back of my mind I am trying to rush towards "R," because I have a  William Blake  bio I am dying to read.        &nbsp;    O how I long for the man who will spout Blake poems to me...        &nbsp;      &nbsp;

       I should be scanning.     &nbsp;   But instead, I am blogging.     &nbsp;   Somehow I have become addicted. I think it could be the candy-colored font fun that is making me happy.     &nbsp;   I wish I was in my new apartment.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Moritfying: My lovely boss Carol asked me to stand in our doorway to direct the delivery guy to room 169 to drop off some boxes. Instead of just saying ok, I instead decide to say "Okily Dokily" a la Ned Flanders. Of course, right as I am saying this and walking to the door, I see the superfoxyboy who works upstairs strolling down the hall to the stairwell that is  five feet from me.  And so I duck my head, not ready to see the bemused expression that is doubtlessly on his face.       &nbsp;    We all need embarassing work stories.

       I am  not  a patient person. I really don't care that it's only 8 something in the morning on the left coast. I am super anxious to hear back from Jeff. I want to hear from him not only just because, but also because a slight worry has creeped into the back of my mind:    What if he really doesn't care about resuming communication?    What if he has totally written me out of his life, and doesn't feel the need to resuscitate our friendship.     &nbsp;    Could I be any more overanalytical???

        music for the day: modest mouse - float on (#3 on their new album)      &nbsp;   It is amazing. I walked into the office 15 minutes late and in a very bad mood (being stuck in traffic/having tiffs with one's mother will do that to you) when lo and behold. I opened my Outlook inbox and what was awaiting me, but an email from... Jeff.  I felt like Charlie when he opened his Wonka Bar and found the Golden Ticket. The email was just one line. But he knew exactly who I was. Which means that my sleuthing (look out Nancy Drew) paid off which means that maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to salvage a relationship with Jeff. Which would make me the happiest girl in the world. If I wasn't sharing an office I would be sitting here grinning like an idiot. But I'm smiling on the inside.     &nbsp;    Today is: The Hives

        i am going to be hearing the song of the scanner in my sleep.      &nbsp;   That is, if I am not kept awake by horrible dreams like the one I had last night.     &nbsp;   I was in a huge huge huge old pile of a house. Though I wasn't really me. I was some sort of omniscient being. There were loads of people in this dream, most of whom seemed to be designers on Trading Spaces. Don't ask. The only one I really remember is Laurie, and she was in a long floaty frothy confection of a dress and she was being chased around by one of her dearly departed relations. There were loads of ghosts in this one. I woke up with a start and I remember not wanting to open my eyes for fear of finding someone unexpected in my room. Most of the dream has faded, but it was extremely creepy.     &nbsp;    Nightmares do not a happy camper make.

        music for the day: bauhaus 1979-1983 volume one.&nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Manic Monday. Here I am, once more. Embarking upon what will hopefully prove to be a fruitful blogging journey. Time will tell.     &nbsp;    Self-reflection  has been a solid theme in my life lately. Various things and people have led me to look back into my deep dark past (and not so distant past) and examine the way I used to be. It's disturbing to look at one's personality under a microscope and to note how much of myself seems so foreign and unlikeable to me now.  I do not like the person I once was , and am fighting against the characteristics of this self that still rear their ugly heads from time to time. (Neuroses,  moi ?)     &nbsp;   Lately, I have been made to look at myself through the eyes of others.  Q : Does it really upset people that much that I am enamored of one bar? And that&nbsp;I have a lot of crushes? Is that really a reflection of me as a whole, or is it just bits and pieces?  A:  ??     &nbsp;   Someone, a someone who was once a very dear friend of mine, told me that our interests were going in different directions, and that she seemed to resent always going to one bar with me and discussing boys and trying to meet band members...which, strangely, had never been a problem before. So what does this mean? Is it true? Am I that predictable and one-dimensional? I am sure she would describe me as a stock-character, the typical boy-crazy lush. Yeah, maybe. But I didn't hear other suggestions coming out of anyone else's mouth. But I paused and reflected and pondered. I can't say that I agree with what she said, or the ways in which she expressed her views. I mean, email, come on! Let's sit down woman to woman and tawk. This&nbsp;girl also decided to treat me as a problem that might go away if avoided. Seriously.&nbsp;I feel like she&nbsp;is not in fact the person who was my friend, but that aliens have taken hold of her body. I am willing to admit fault, but only as the situation demands. And who treats people like that? The whole thing left me&nbsp;soul-searchingly confused and hurt and demoralized. For a few hours I questioned my self-worth. But perhaps I am not the one with the&nbsp;issues after all. It shouldn't be hard to accept faults in your friends. It's part of what makes them who they are, right?     &nbsp;   But other, even more recent reflections have occurred. Boy-based reflection. One thing I do admit and hate about myself is my sloth-like approach to friendships. I don't know if it's a mental defect, or just my social-butterfly-esque attitude that makes it hard for me to sustain friendships for long periods of time. It's not that I don't love my friends. I do. But for some reason...I always just let things slide. And it's not that I mean to. I just...do. This applies especially to ex-boyfriends. I almost always tend to let people drift away. And I have always regretted it. So I always try to make amends; to find people and at least say hi before I then become a sloth again and stop writing. Right now I am looking for Jeff. We met in high school, at this summer program at Falls Church High School. We had a writing class together. We bonded, thanks in part to our mutual sarcasm. He with his heavy metal and me with my Britpop was probably an odd pairing, but it worked. We eventually got together, and then in a few weeks it was over. After we lost touch while I was away at school, I think he moved back to California. And I was left without a way to get in touch. And now somehow years have gone by. Then, a few weeks ago, I was going through boxes of old photos, and I found one he had given me. It brought back this rush of feelings and I stood there, reeling, gripping this little photo and wondering what the fuck is wrong with me.  Why did I let him go???      &nbsp;   So I have been searching. And I think I might have found him. So I am crossing my fingers and hoping I have. Because I need to apologize on behalf of the old me and try and make nice with the new me. It's always funny to me when I realize just how much a person has meant to me, at a point where the person is no longer in my life. Jeff meant the world to me, and when we broke things off (his idea) I was crushed and recoiled.&nbsp;But now I want him back in my life. I don't care if he's all the way across the country.     &nbsp;    today is: getting a seat on metro. reaching and going beyond the halfway mark of my book. lunch outside.      &nbsp;

       Music for the Day: 94.7 fm    &nbsp;  Almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and Constitution that is making traffic hell in Virginia. Thankfully I was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto Route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically I am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car.     Yesterday Sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email I wrote to Ivan Meisel on ESPN.com was published online! I had no idea; I thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but I guess someone thought otherwise. Though I can't tell if he's mocking me...take a look and see for yourself.    &nbsp;  urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=1819248    It's towards the middle of the page.     &nbsp;  Also watched the Kerry speech last night. I think it was really well done. I loved that he was&nbsp;showing his nervousness; it just makes him seem less political and more normal person. I thought he made excellent points and definitely should have left the right-wingers quaking in their cowboy boots. The more I see of Kerry, the more I like him. I think he'll make an excellent president. I must remember to try and volunteer for the campaign...I was also moved to tears when Kerry's co-vets were on the stage, introducing Max Cleland who ultimately introduced Kerry. It was so touching, and really puts the character of Kerry in an even more positive light.     &nbsp;   I can't wait for November.

        Things are definitely coming along nicely.    My black mood from yesterday has gone, replaced by a more optimistic frame of mind. Well, aside from being totally and utterly bored .    Apart from that, I've arranged to have my new bed moved to my new place the same day as all my other crap is going over there. Yay. So it'll be one fell swoop as opposed to several lesser swoops. I have made nice with Jackie (I did feel really badly about being sharp with her), so all is seemingly well. Now I just have to finish packing everything, which seems rather daunting even though it shouldn't be.     Funny thing is, 3 days before my move and I am still just la-di-da-ing along like usual. It doesn't feel different. I don't feel like in 3 days I will not be living in my house anymore. It's a bit unsettling, but also more than a bit liberating. Even if I will be eating almost nothing until the next payday (ahhh paycheck to paycheck living)...

       Excerpts from last night's email:     "We should've seen a movie or two back when, though...we'll have to do that sometime in the future."     "Do you remember Lake Accotink? I was thinking about when we hung out there that one time. I had&nbsp;such a great time&nbsp;with you that day. I miss it.&nbsp;"     On the surface, the Lake Accotink quote is pretty standard, if not a bit yawn-worthy. However, the day we hung out there was the climax of our pre-romantic relationship days. We were already well into the spending all night on the phone era, but this glaringly bright hot summer day&nbsp;was the day we crossed the line from just friends into something more. The day we were at the Lake was the day he first kissed me. I think we might have been sitting on a picnic table or something (my memory = Alzheimer-ish). All I can really remember is how amazing that day was for me. I was, in my sweet little teenage way, bursting with joy. I mean, who isn't blissful to know that someone they really care for feels the same way about them? That day held the first of many kisses, and it remains a very special day for me. So now I am going to sit here and ponder this statement. What does it all mean?? When he asks if I remember that day, is he doing it because we had just a generally wonderful time together, or is it something more? I feel almost that I am getting way ahead of myself. But if things keep going the way they are, either he is going to have to come here or I am going to have to go there, but either way we will have to see each other. I think it's fairly unavoidable.

        Music for the Day: Nada Surf - Let Go     How good this album is! I bought it after seeing Nada Surf live last September, a show which opened my eyes to the fact that they are so much more than that one big song they had when I was in high school (you know, "Popular"). They are so wonderful. Made my commute to work that much more enjoyable. Nada Surf on the discman, and Iris Murdoch in hand to satisfy my literary craving. Excellent.    So last night was wonderful. Moms and I had a lovely dinner at Austin Grill. It was busy in there at first, but since we only got there about 7:30 the place thinned out as we were working our way through our quesadillas. I think Moms enjoyed it, which is good. I wanted her to have a great time on her birthday.     Once we got home, we switched on the tv and surfed for a bit, until at 10:30 the future VP of this country began to speak. If John Edwards is not someday President, then I feel Armageddon will have happened. He has "It." He has that  je no se quois ( please excuse my spelling, I've never taken French). He is the perfect politician, Chris and I think he's a bit Kennedy-esque (though doubtless he's more wholesome). John Edwards rocks my world. I can't wait to see Kerry speak tonight.    &nbsp;  Also had an email from Jeff greet me this morning. I'm off to reply, and then I'll post a few things from it.

       Communications with Jeff have stalled. Not sure why. What I am sure of is that I am not enjoying this lack of written correspondence. I know there is a good reason (like perhaps he is not as obsessive about checking email as I am, or doesn't have Outlook which makes it glaringly obvious when you have new mail and when you don't), but it doesn't make me any less melodramaticly wistful about things. Ah well.     &nbsp;  After a chat with lovely Mat I think I am going to head out. Time for Moms' birthday din din.

       I am in some sort of apathy-ridden hell. I cannot come close to explaining it, but the aforementioned apathy is there, as is a clear and present blah mentality. People call with valid (though probably more often than not invalid) questions, and instead of telling them to fuck off it's on our website as I would relish doing, I smile and nod (pointless, since no one can see it) and do what I have to do. But I am feeling wasted. Heather, I believe this is a part of what you are feeling now, as well. I don't know what's wrong with me. This week has become nightmarish, but not in its' outlandish horror. Instead it is a nightmare of mediocrity and things mildly falling apart. I haven't heard back from my movers, other movers can't move my bed when I want it moved, and though I know it's eye-roll inducing, it is enough to frustrate my frazzled nerves. I feel on edge and like I am not entirely here. And I don't quite know what is wrong with me.

        I am worried I am being bratty.      &nbsp;  I am having marginal issues with the bed I bought for my new apartment. The girl I am buying the bed from is understandably busy, she is working two jobs all the while packing her life up in order to move to San Francisco. Great. So I think we have finally pinpointed a time on Friday when I could maybe have the bed picked up and brought to my new place. However...Jackie's old roomie still has stuff there. It seems she (old roommate) is "particular" about people touching her stuff. Granted, she technically has until Sunday to have everything out, but I don't really want to a) have the bed delivered but hanging out against the wall in the living room or something, for myself and moms to move into my room Saturday&nbsp;or Sunday, b) wait until Sunday for the movers to move it, or c) have the bed delivered next week. So I think I might have been a wee bit snippy in my response to my roomie...argh. I am just frustrated and beginning to get tense about the move. And so I am beginning to take this out on others.    &nbsp;    Beware, others. You have been warned. The Wrath of Megan might soon be out in force .

        "We can all fly as high as we aspire. Unless you are a chicken."     I have a magnet that says something like that, and when I am sad or even just bored, I think of that magnet, and it's primitive picture of a chicken with a thought bubble that says "shit," I cannot help but grin.     I am now bored enough to think of the chicken.    Happily, though, the sun has broken through the clouds. Moms yesterday said that she heard somewhere that in the entire month of July, we have yet to have one full strictly sunshiney, blue-skyed day. That totally explains why people seem to be dragging along, we all need the sun to keep us going.

       Am I.     So I was pondering the idea of whether celebrity breakup, like celebrity deaths, come in threes.     &nbsp;  Most recently we have seen the deaths of  Ronald Reagan ,  Ray Charles , and  Marlon Brando .     &nbsp;  The most recent celebrity breakups have been  Paris Hilton and Nick Carter  (o, the shock) and  Kirsten Dunst and Jake Gyllenhaal  (more shocking)...who will be next? And will my theory prove true?

       Ok.     &nbsp;  From Jeff's last email to me, from super early this morning my time/super late last night his time...     "I miss you."     "Also it'd be nice to talk on the phone with you as well."    And, most adorably, he called me  "luv."  I luv being called luv. Heh.     &nbsp;   He misses me . I am not sure what exactly to make of this. Other than, of course, the obviousness of the statement...there is the subtext of what is said. And sometimes I am very very bad at figuring out subtext. In this case it was like, "hi, how was your weekend" followed by the "I miss you." And since I am notorious for overthinking just about everything people say to me, doubtless I will spend most of the day poring over these comments. Until of course I hear from him again, and being to pontificate over the meaning of phrases from the forthcoming email.  Help.

        Music for the Day: The Hives - Tyrannosaurous hives     Oh how I adore the latest Hives record. I bought it last night when I was buying the book for moms and I listened to it this morning in effort to wake me up a little. It did the job...or as much as I can be woken up on this kind of rainy humid gross morning.     Last night, or this morning I'm not sure which, there was a massive thunderstorm. I was too groggy to fully appreciate it, but I was happy to hear the thunder. I almost thought I was dreaming it.     Am currently grinning like a maniacal inmate after Nurse Ratchet has given me some sort of shock treatment. And yes, it has to do with Jeff. But I'll post more later.

Just one of the all-time greatest hair metal songs ever.        &nbsp;   Got Moms' birthday present tonight, too. I hope she likes it; I decided that since we had such a lovely time seeing Hampton Court Palace together when she came to visit me in Edinburgh that I would get her this super nice, autographed book about the Palace. I'm also going to take her to dinner at the Austin Grille, after work. I can be quite a good daughter sometimes.

       At lunch I began reading  The Nice and The Good  by Iris Murdoch. I think I'll find it very enjoyable, based upon the chapters I was able to read over my hour of sanctity. Back to fiction for me, I do like bios/autobios, but I like the escapism that a good piece of fiction can bring.     &nbsp;   I  also like the escapism of sometimes thinking about old boyfriends.     Excerpts from Jeff's last email of last week:     &nbsp;     "Is this weird to say...you had this sedative-like effect on me in VA from hanging out with you.&nbsp;Seriously though, I was driving yesterday to the beach, and it had felt good to just have been talking to you."   &nbsp;   "yeah talking about nothing was fun with you. Perhaps we'd be able to do it again someday soon."   &nbsp;   "I remember sitting next to you in that creative writing class and having fun reading your stories and that was how we met. You made things a lot better there."       &nbsp;   What's a nostalgic romantic girl to do??? (Other than stop pining, of course).

        So I'm reading this thing about Mary Kate Olsen Twin being out of her clinic, and I hit this part about her spokesman, and in true Megan form I wonder about something totally random:   How does one go about becoming a spokesman/woman?!        No, really.     How does someone get into the spokesperson field? And is there stiff competition? And are spokespeople PAs, or their own separate entity? And if one wanted to go about becoming a spokesperson, can you go to school for it??? It just seems like one of those "huh?" jobs, like that might be really cool but you're not quite sure how you got it. I think it would be a totally rad job. All you'd have to do is write statements for your client and then talk to the press and that's that.     Easy peasy.

       By Tom Friend  ESPN The Magazine   When I was growing up in Washington, D.C. during the late '60s-early '70s, my folks would drive us through Baltimore on our way to New York City.    And I'd hold my nose.    I don't know if it was the factories or the smoke stacks or the Chesapeake Bay, but Baltimore literally smelled back then. And, based on what I'm hearing now, it still smells. Any time now, Major League Baseball will announce the fate of the Montreal Expos, and more and more it looks like they'll be coming to my hometown ... unless Baltimore throws a hissy fit.  What a travesty. Their baseball owner, Peter Angelos, thinks the metropolitan area -- separated by a 40-mile stretch of highway -- can't support two teams.    But what he's actually saying is: Baltimore can't support one team .   Trust me, Baltimore is not a great sports town, never has been. And we're supposed to pay for that? D.C.'s been bailing out Baltimore for years, and it's time to stop, time for them to have a go of it on their own. Let us have our team, you can have yours, and we'll see you next June during Interleague.  Let me take you back to 1969. I'm 8 years old, the Orioles are about to play the Twins in the playoffs, and I ask my dad if we can get tickets to Game 1. No prob. He swoops in from his office on K Street, picks up a pair a couple days before the game, and we sit on the third base side. What, it wasn't sold out already? He didn't have to stand in line at Memorial Stadium for 24 hours? Of course not. This is Baltimore.  So, I get greedy and ask if we can get tickets to Game 1 of the World Series against the Mets. No prob. Don Buford leads off with an Oriole home run, Baltimore wins the opener and my dad predicts an Oriole sweep. Somebody sweeps all right (the Mets take the next four), but, I didn't mind, I was just glad to see a World Series game. It was easy. Dad didn't have pay scalper prices.  Let me tell you something, if my Senators had been in the World Series, there wouldn't have been any ducats to be had. We hosted the All-Star game that year, in '69, and my dad couldn't get a sniff of a ticket. Yeah, yeah, everyone says D.C. was a bad baseball town, that we lost two teams. But remember this: we were God awful. Not one year, not five years, but every year. First in war, first peace, last in the American League. And we're talking bad ownership. Clark Griffith had an All-Star in Harmon Killebrew and a young Tony Oliva in waiting, and, what's he do? He bails. By the time the guys are in the World Series, in '65, they're doing it in Minnesota. Bob Short, our next owner, thought Ted Williams would teach everyone how to hit .300, but that was a laugh. We had a fourth-place run in '69 (were still 23 games behind the Orioles), and Frank Howard's home runs were more gargantuan than Mark McGwire's, but that wasn't enough to save the franchise. There was no subway in D.C. yet, and the neighborhood around RFK Stadium had an image problem. So, Short high-tailed it to Texas after the '71 season.  The metropolitan D.C. area hasn't seen major-league baseball since the days of Frank Howard in the '60s and '70s.  Did I root for the Orioles after the Senators left?   Not in a million years .  They used to kick our tails back then. Hated them, wasn't about to adopt them. They had Brooksie and Frank. Boog, Blair and Belanger. Four 20-game winners. They had all this talent, and couldn't get butts in the seats, and it was an absolute waste, a crime. We were dying for a Brooks Robinson. Or a close approximation. Auerilio Rodriguez and Mike Epstein had to do.  And then what happens? We bail Baltimore out. Once the Senators left, people in D.C. eventually started going to see the Orioles.   Shame on those people  . But, trust me, it wasn't the native Washingtonians who were going most of the time, it was the imports. It's a transient city, and all these transplants had no idea about the rivalry between the two cities, no idea that there used to be baseball in D.C., that the Orioles used to stomp all over us. And when Cal Ripken showed up, well, there actually was a reason to go. The Orioles became a regional team, at least perceptually.   But the true D.C. natives knew better, knew we were the superior sports town.    Let's go back in time again, this time to 1977. The Colts are playing the Raiders, the defending champion Raiders, in an attractive playoff game, and Baltimore can't even sell it out in time to lift the TV blackout. We weren't even allowed to watch it in D.C. The Ghost to the Post? One of the greatest overtime games in history? Only saw the highlights, because Baltimore couldn't or wouldn't support its football team.    The Colts were smart; they snuck out of town  . Just like the Bullets fled in '73.  And did we need Baltimore to come on over help us cheer on the Redskins? Hell no. Did we need Baltimore to help us with the Bullets/Wizards? Hell no. (Baltimore didn't want any part of us, anyway. Which was great. Thank you.)  So now here we are in 2004. It's been 30 years since a President threw out a first pitch at RFK, 30 years since we've had a real sniff of baseball & and Peter Angelos is whining, bellyaching. Doesn't he get it?   We'll be in the National League, he'll be in the Am  erican  . When they're home, we'll be on the road. When we're home, they'll be on the road. He'll give people in his own area a chance to drive over and see Bonds, Pujols and Gagne. A chance to see players they've never seen before. There'll be new young fans, more buzz about the game. The rivalry will be intense, the way the   Cubs   and   White Sox   are, the way the   A's   and   Giants   are. It might even convince Angelos to put a decent product on the field.  Listen, did Washington raise a stink when the Browns moved to Baltimore? Did the Redskins threaten to sue Art Modell? No and no.    You got to have your football team; so let us have our baseball team  .  And we'll see you in June.  Tom Friend is a senior writer for ESPN The Magazine.        I couldn't agree more .       The nation's capitol should have a team in the national pastime. And Peter Angelos is an  evil, evil greedy little man  who should be thrown away like yesterday's trash.

        Really, I do. They are creepy and icky and I wish it was Fall already so there wouldn't be as many of them around.      Thank you, Heather, for the Aveeno Anti-Itch stuff. My nickel-sized spider bite and I are forever in your debt.     &nbsp;   Robert's blog entry about high school combined with the descent of hundreds of high school kids upon my office have made me think about high school. I feel like so much has changed since I was in high school, like some sort of line has been crossed. Kids seem to be much less innocent than they were ten years ago when I was a freshman. All the girls seem to want to emulate Britney and her plastic wunderkind and all the boys want to be pimptacular. They all want to grow up too fast. I remember feeling lots of pressures back in the day, but we didn't look like little Britneys. And the biggest thing I let myself worry about was getting into college. Now it's changed. Kids are trying to grow up so fast, and we who are older and possibly wiser look and them and want to scream at them not to rush things. At least, I do anyway. Sometimes I long for the days where everything was simple and all I had to worry about was what to wear to school and whether or not I'd be able to stay awake during first period. But maybe I'm alone in thinking this. I feel like a grandma waxing poetic about "the good old days" when I had to walk 15 miles to school barefoot on ten feet of snow.

        Oh yes. I have it. I am one of those people. The drivers in this area infuriate me. Nothing too spectacularly idiotic this morning, though there were some serious wankers at the gas station, but just on the whole, people in this area amaze me with their stupidity that seems to know no bounds. Argh.     Ranting aside, I am back at work after a very nondescript weekend. Saturday I spent most of the day cleaning and packing, and Sunday I wasn't feeling well so I just took it easy and watched lots of brain cell-killing tv. I was really happy, since  Shark Week  started on the Discovery Channel Sunday night. Yes, I am a nerd, but I do believe I have already made this a known fact. So that I would watch Shark Week shouldn't really come as a surprise. I used to actually love sharks a lot, as opposed to my frightened fascination of them that I have now. I remember reading about a female diver who did lots of dives with sharks earlier in the 20th century (Eugenie Clark maybe?!) and I used to want to be like her. I wanted to don a suit of chain mail and be slid down into the murky depths and just be amongst the sharks. Then, one day maybe fifteen years or so ago...I saw  "Jaws."  And I immediately changed my dream job to something much safer, like archaelogy or something. That movie put the fear of God into me, and to this day I have serious problems with deep water (swimming in it, flying over it, whatever)...but I still am addicted to watching programs about sharks. Go figure.     It's one of those opressively grey overcast days here. The temperature isn't bad, but there is still something that feels rather stifling in the air. Perhaps I only feel that way since it's Monday, and I have so much to do this week.

        Music for the Day: The Cooper Temple Clause - Kick Up The Fire...       Goodness Gracious what a marvelous night!        I think that as I sit here I might still be a wee bit drunk . The lady bartender at Saint Ex was not only generous with her charges but with her alcohol.       I shall begin at the beginning of the evening. Watched BB (yay Scott evicted!!!) and then got myself ready for some fun by putting on a black tee black skirt and my black knee high boots. Met up with Hannah on S Street, and proceeded to Saint Ex. There was a good amount of people downstairs, including a super hott boy whom I have met on several occasions in my Kingpin/Velvet Lounge past. Hannah and I grabbed some drinks and a table and waited for the fun to begin. About half an hour later, the Cooper boys show up, along with Laura and Tom. Melissa Auf Der Maur was with them, too. So I turn into a giddy nervous mess, which sometimes happens to me around boys I like (and boy, do I like those CTC boys; sometimes I wish they weren't in a band so I wouldn't be as nervous around them). So they all take turns spinning, and it's quite the eclectic mix. Kieran spins the most stuff I like, though strangely I am having a really hard time remembering what he played...anyway. JP showed up, and sat with me and Hannah for a while. Then Lisa showed up, too, which was lovely. The peer pressure Hannah and I put on her must have worked. After a few beverages, I finally got the nerve to go speak to Kieran at the bar. He remembered me, and might have even remembered my name (he remembered it started with M, and then I told him, and he said "was I done guessing?" in this very cute cheeky way). So we chatted for a moment, then went back to our respective tables. Later Hannah was talking to Ben, so Laura and I went over, and I chatted to Ben, who was perhaps even more boozed up than I was. He too remembered me, which was nice. And we had a brief conversation about his hair. He told me he cut it himself, and I'm not sure if I believe it or not. Later, Laura introduced me to Jon and Fisher. They're both really nice, but I suddenly got a case of the mutes. Matt from Muse showed up for a while, and Carlos and Sam and Daniel from Interpol stuck around for quite some time. Last call came around, and I chatted with Joel from Kingpin for a while before heading outside. I ran into Laura, Tom, and Kieran; who were waiting for Fisher and Jon and their tour manager to get pizza. We started talking to Ben once Tom went back to fetch him, and when he went to get on their van we all shook his hand and he winked at me. He is quite possibly one of the loveliest men in the world. Said goodbye to Kieran and Jon, and Jon asked if I was set for the show. I thanked him and said yes. I cannot wait to see them tonight.        O happy night.        I also finished my book yesterday after work, so the day was super all around.       Time to get to drinking this nice tall bottle of water.

       All that is separating me from the end of my book is 30 pages. I managed to read quite a bit during lunch, and I am tempted to stay later at work so I can finally get to the end of this supercalifragically wonderful book. I'm fairly miffed at myself for never having read Iris Murdoch before. Once I finish my alphabetical romp I'll have to read more of her books.       Unrelated now. But  fuck me, it's already August . August 5th. How did that happen? And moreover, how have I been here for 5 months already? Time is definitely working against me. Oh well, at least when I turn 26 next year I'll have lower insurance rates...

       So bored that I am even sick of looking at shoes online. It is nice and cool in my office and all I want to do is go down the hall to the ladies lounge and curl up on the sofa and take a nap. I shouldn't be tired, really, despite being out I actually made it home before midnight, and slept about an hour later than I intended so...I should be just peachy. Instead I sit here, staring out the window at the glaringly grey sky and think about...nothing.       I'm going to water Planty. That'll keep me busy for, oh, a minute maybe...

        Music for the Day: Depeche Mode - Violator     I went out and had a rollicking good time with Christina on Black Cat Wednesday. We discussed all manner of things, but it mainly was that we are far too wonderful to be single. Al supplied us with our usual beverages as we pontificated and philosophized. However, this means that I was a wee bit late getting to work this morning. I continue to burn the candle at both ends. And it's only going to get worse: tonight is the Cooper Temple Clause dj set at Saint Ex, followed by the Curiosa festival on Friday (stop me if you think that you've heard this one before).     My roommate is coming back to town Saturday, so somewhere between now and then I have to get the apartment back to a non-covered with boxes state.     Another email from Jeff greeted my bleary eyes this morning. Not quite as sweet as the previous few emails, but really he could just send me something saying "hi" and I'd get all swoony over it.     Ok. Time to go...attempt to look productive. There is less than nothing going on here, so it's pretty hard to look busy when everyone knows we're not.

       Music for the Day: Brian Eno - Here Come the Warm Jets       It is way to early to be as hot as it is outside.      So I had the weirdest thing happen to me last night after work. I was standing on the platform at Foggy Bottom, towards the end (because I am very fond of being in the last car). There was no one else around me. I was just standing there, when all of a sudden I felt the sensation of a hand being on my left hip. And then it was gone.  There was no one else near me . I've never felt anything like that, apart from of course when a person's hand is actually on my hip. It wasn't just one of those metro train-entering-station induced feelings, either. It wasn't a breeze. I have no idea what it was. All I know is that it freaked me out.       I watched all manner of mindless tv last night. Big Brother was on, and evil Jase won himself the Power of Veto (I hate these cheesy things the US version of BB comes up with). If I had to live in a house with Jase and Scott I think I would probably nominate myself for eviction, just to get away from them. Then it was time for Outback Jack/The Amazing Race. I watched most of the Race, but tuned in to the end of Outback Jack to see "Jack" eliminate Maria. I was happy, but was in disbelief that Natalie, the total airhead from Kentucky, has gotten as far as she has. I can't see her last long in the Outback, really. There's nowhere for her to get her manicure...      Today I managed to wake up late. Again. It's rather funny, I live so close now that I just sleep later and later and later...will definitely have to work on this.     Only two days until the Curiosa gig! And only one day from the Cooper Temple Clause dj set. Double the happiness!!     Still no further word from Jeff. This is the longest we've gone without corresponding since I tracked him down. It's been since Friday. Oh well...

And that old lady in the commercial for Capri Sun who takes forever and a day to walk down her front walk?   That's going to be me  . I have such bad ankles from my time as a high school rah rah that going up and down stairs so many times in shoes with not much support has me hobbling around like an old woman after too much time here on my ass in my chair. It is awful and horrible and depressing. And painful. And I only make it worse with my choice of footwear. What's a girl with an addiction to high heels supposed to do?!?!

       Music for the Day: Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Fever to Tell    I am drained. Exhausted. Spent. Who knew moving stuff from just a couple rooms could be such a physically and emotionally draining experience?????    This weekend I must have gone up and down the stairs at my new apartment something like fifty times. Carrying heavy bags and boxes half the time. My feet/ankles may never be the same. Apart from the furniture and about ten boxes of books, moms and I moved all of my stuff. And that's a lot of stuff. I was at home again yesterday, exhausted, yet I still went over to moms and got even more stuff from the house. It hurt when I laid down to go to bed last night, my ankles hurt like mad. But thus is the price of moving, I suppose.    But my apartment is wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. It's almost totally tidy, and then it will be perfect. I love it.

        Music for the Day: Interpol - Turn On The Bright Lights     How much I love that album, almost two years after I bought it. The wait for the new album is driving me crazy...      So here is an example of how life can suck. Last night, I wanted to go see  the Zutons  at Iota, since I am now within walking distance of the club. I go to an ATM to check up on funding, and I have...$8.32 in my account. Not only do tickets cost $12, but you have to be able to withdraw at least $10. So no Zutons for me. Instead I go spend some quality time with Paul and Brendan, and watch them shoot rubber bands at each other while I sit on a stool playing Text Twist. Wicked. I did watch  the Graduate  last night, though, which was super. Yet another movie that draws gasps of disbelief from people when I have to admit to never having seen it. At least missing the Zutons was good for one thing.     Tonight, however, I do believe I am hitting the town.  Two If By Sea  are at the Black Cat tonight, and  Brooke and Mark  are in town from Wilmington. So it could be a late night. Thankfully, as of this morning I should be out of the danger area, and can now have a good time to celebrate my week of hermitage. I love payday...

       Storming again. As much as I like storms, I am not looking forward to navigating the doutblessly flooded streets and sidewalks on my way to and from metro.       I thought I would throw in some Jeff-isms before I head home, to work on getting the cash for the Zutons gig tonight. Since it has been ages since we've seen each other, I sent him a jpeg of me, from Halloween (I was a tarty French Maid)...      "Well you look lovely as a maid. Quite lovely indeed. Still the same Megan. I miss you more now..."    "I guess that's what counts... being thankful for stuff. I'm thankful for what you have given me and especially that you contacted me again."     That last comment stems from a dialogue we had going about crappy parents (I have one crappy one and one awesome one) and such. I miss this boy so much.

         Music for the day: Elastica - BBC Sessions       We had one hell of a storm here late yesterday afternoon. At one point I swear it was right over my office. I haven't seen hail like that in quite some time, and the thunder/lightning were rather impressive. It offered a welcome diversion from the boredom that was the close of business yesterday.       I've begun reading  Boredom . It seems to me that Alberto Moravia must have had issues with his parents, as his protagonist always seems to have a neurotic mother and philandering, missing in action father. Thus far it's enjoyable, but I'm only about 30 pages into it.       Went to moms' for dinner last night. I am very glad to see her when I go over, and very glad at the same time to be in my own space. She is the most wonderful person, and the most important person in my life, yet I am happier in my apartment than at home. This is probably weird   .     Not much else to tell, yet.

       I was just going through some of my old emails from the time I spent in Edinburgh, and it really has struck me just what a glutton for punishment I really am when it comes to love.     I have yet to have a fully-functional, long-term local relationship. I kid you not.      I  nstead, I fall for people like  Gavin . Gavin was a co-worker at one of the offices I did some temp work for when in Edinburgh. I had it bad for him as soon as I saw him and his eyes (big brown puppydog eyes). Basically we began an email/work flirtation, that at least for me quickly morphed into some hardcore feelings. During the end of my second week at work, and my last day seeing him there (he was going to be on vacation for my entire last week), we met outside the office and he kissed me. To this day he is the only person who has rendered me starry-eyed and seeing fireworks during a kiss. We only saw each other a few more times before I left Scotland (he, of course, had a girlfriend whom he wasn't prepared to break things off with for a girl who wasn't around for long), but the boy broke my heart. It was my own fault for falling in love with someone I couldn't have, but it was the most excrutiating pain I've ever felt in relation to love. It took forever to get over him, as well. He used to talk about coming to the States to work for a while, which never happened. We haven't been in contact for ages. Part of me would like to see him, just once more, but I know that's a bad idea. It was just weird reading through our old emails to and fro, it's like reliving the whole thing, to a certain extent.         I want a nice, normal relationship with a nice, normal boy who won't make me fall in love with him only to treat my heart like a pinata.

        Music for the Day: Duran Duran - Rio     You know, if I had never seen the movie  Barbarella , I wouldn't get to feel like a music snob, in knowing where  Duran Duran  got their name.  Matmos  also took their name from that excellently weird film.    Speaking of films. I am on a movie kick. Two nights, two movies. I think I am going to try to see a movie every night this week. Well, except Thursday and Friday. I saw  Dr. Strangelove  last night. Totally loved it. Though I wanted to see what happened in the cave while the Doomsday Machine was going off.  And I wanted to know more about Dr. Stangelove. Like, say, why is he such a nut? And what's with his hand? And why did that one guy order the nukes to be dropped? But yeah. I loved it. Such a good movie. I can't believe I'd never seen it before. And how timely it is, in a way. I liked the president in the movie much more than our real live president...    I saw a guy, had to be mid-40s, on metro this morning who had a comb sticking out of his back pocket. It was a plastic purply-blue comb. I found it strangely amusing.    It's hot this morning. Muggy. I am ready for it to changes seasons. I feel like the longest season in this town is summer, though.     Going to think about what to rent tonight. And to think about Jeff's email from last night. Sigh.

       Ha! Now this is more like it. A ranking that actually fits D.C.     Most people will tell you this city is fairly easy to get around. I disagree. And it seems so do many people.   urlLink  http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/0804/165048.html        We are, it seems, the second hardest city to navigate in the country.    Damn you, Boston.    Always a bridesmaid...

       I just found this top ten list for the best and worst cities for dating across the country. Amazingly, I am still not sure how, D.C. wasn't on the list of worst dating cities. Actually, I am rather mystified by its absence from the list...     Best Cities for Dating:         1. Austin, TX     2. Colorado Springs, CO     3. San Diego, CA     4. Raleigh/Durham, NC     5. Seattle, WA     6. Charleston, SC     7. Norfolk, VA     8. Ann Arbor, MI     9. Springfield, MA     10. Honolulu, HI       Worst Cities for Dating:     1. Kansas City, MO     2. Wichita, KS     3. Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN     4. Detroit, MI     5. Louisville, KY     6. Greensboro/Winston-Salem, NC     7. Atlanta, GA     8. Pittsburgh, PA     9. Houston, TX     10. Charlotte, NC    Not having spent a significant amount of time in any of these locales, I can't really say whether I agree or disagree. But it's interesting. Very very interesting.     D.C. still should have been #1 for Bad Dating Cities...

       Music for the Day: Mix Made by Moi (Killers, Stills, McLusky etc)    Not sure if I can really consider this mid-week or not, but I have a major case of the blahs. I almost wish for the mean reds or the blues or something, because let's face it the blahs are just boring to have.     Last night went to Courthouse and hung out with the boys for a while. I "rented"  Lost in Translation , which I hadn't yet seen (yes, I am a loser). I fell in love with a film. I adored it. I think it has jumped into the realms of my favorite all-time movies. It's such a great commentary on the nature of relationships, and how you can meet someone and become really close in such a short period of time. Beautiful, ephemoral relationships.      Then, after that brilliant film, I fell asleep while watching the finale of For Love or Money. Now I must go and see who Rachel the shudder-inducing girl picked, and whether they played her for money.

       ...so little cashflow.       Here's a sampling of the next few weeks, in terms of shows I'd like to see.       Thursday: The Zutons   Friday: Two If By Sea   Monday: Elefant/Ambulance Ltd.   Wednesday: Gomez   Friday: Alcian Blue   Saturday: Enon    That's all within the next 12 days.   WTF?!   Why, like everything else in life, do all the good shows feel the need to happen at the same effing time?! For those of us who are financially strapped,   this is no good.

       And I would have thought Texas would have held this honor, especially whilst under W.      urlLink http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/0804/164588.html    Who would have thought it, Virginia = Execution Capitol of the U.S.?!

        How good is  Heathers ????!?!?!?!?!?     Definitely one of my all-time super most favorite movies ever. I watched it last night for the first time in a long while, and it was as beautifully venomous as the last time I saw it. I wonder, though, whatever happened to the actresses who played  Heather Chandler  and  Heather MacNamara ?! It seems that only one Heather went on to bigger and...*cough*...better? things. Shannen went from one annoying high school to another.      I am going to have to resurrect the term  "what's your damage?"

       Music for the Day: Placebo - Black Market Music     O what a weekend!! Despite the bad things (temporarily locking myself out of my room; getting my car towed), this weekend was truly a great one. And for one reason:    Curiosa!!     !     Friday was a glorious day; low temperatures (well, low considering it's summer in swampland) and blue sky as far as the eye could see. Hannah and I left about 3:30 to get up to Columbia, Maryland. We got there, went to the 9:32 club to meet some forum people, and got a drink. I had Baileys on the rocks on plastic cups. Awesome. First we sat for a little bit of the  Mogwai  set, and then went over to the second stage to see  The Cooper Temple Clause . Mogwai sounded great, in a deafening kind of way. They supposedly are the loudest band on the planet? Just a rumor I've heard. Anyway, the CTC were on top form, though something was missing. That something was bassist/keyboard whiz  Didz . Though his stand-in Dan Austin was really good, there was just the spark missing that Didz brings to every show. But they were still excellent. It was odd to see them outdoors in the bright sunshine. Poor Ben looked like he was in pain from the night before. I could sympathize. Then we heard a wee bit of  The Rapture  (who sounded fabulous) before going back to the 9:32 area. Then we watched  Interpol , who were far and away the highlight of the night for me. We all decided to sit as close as we could, and Michael (friend from Philly) and I sat on the end of a row, really not horribly far from the stage. And I kid you not, Paul Banks stared at me. More than once. Michael noticed, too. So I did as any awestruck girl with a massive crush would do: I stared back. The new material they played was divine, and the old stuff still sounds just as fresh. They also had some great lighting effects; there was one setting in particular that I loved. A sort of magenta-mixed-with-purple thing, that was truly wondrous. Then we went to the side stage (along with pretty much everyone else who was at the show) to see (or really, hear, since we couldn't see too much)  Muse . They sounded phenomenal. And I am really glad for them that so many people turned out to see them. Finally, it was time for  the Cure . They were beyond perfect. They sounded awesome, and they played for about two hours or so. They even did Friday I'm in Love, which was great to hear. All in all it was one of the best shows I've seen this year.    And now, somehow, it is Monday. And it is beautiful. And I want to be outside...
