						   I for one know what it means to be a liberal. I come from an extremely conservative family. As a matter of fact, pretty much like Sean Hannity and Rush kind of conservative. I came out as a liberal when I was about thirteen, and my grandfather told me he would rather shoot me in the head right then, than see me become a "communist" (and he wasn't kidding). Kind of reminiscent of the McCarthy era, don't you think? I saw us go to war in Viet Nam and trample the constitution. I saw the civil rights of a whole race of people being challenged because that's the way it's always been. I heard conservatives say it was neccesary to kill students at Kent State University who were exercising their constitutional rights. Well when you are faced with that kind of conservatism, you either fall in line or start questioning what is right. I did the latter. I'm a Dem because I believe firmly in the power of the people to govern themselves through the democratic process. I believe in the power of the human spirit, to become better than what we used to be, to grow, to be alive. If the founding fathers wanted the constitution to be a museum piece with no room for improvement, they wouldn't have made a way for us to amend it,... there would only be one party, the conservative Republicans. Things would be the same as they were over two hundred years ago. We'd still be burning witches, stoning homosexuals, and most of the women in this country would be wearing a large "A" emblasoned on their breast in crimson. For me liberalism is a flame... the flame of freedom that burns in the hand of a woman called Liberty. A flame that calls all people equal. She does not stand in the harbour to protect us from the infidel...but to welcome all those who are oppressed. We must ever go forward,...not back.

						   Why am I so hip on slamming Republicans?  Well, the main reason is look what Bush has done to the United States.  He has tossed us into a needless war, alienated our allies (Lets hope we don’t need them any time soon), allows American jobs to go over seas, created the largest budget deficit in a long time (where did the surplus go that President Clinton created) and the list goes on and on.   Now, if anyone can give me a good reason not to slam Republicans I will be more than happy to sit down with you and discuss it.  I will also give you a chance to voice your “fair and balanced opinion”.

						   The other day I was out diligently campaigning for the Kerry-Edwards ticket, like any other good liberal. The local party has a serious shortage of precinct captains, and with my inherent fear of what will happen if GWB has four more years to plunder the countryside, I volunteered and went out and put some blisters on my feet, attempting to spread some of the hope I garnered from the Democratic Convention.  Some of my neighbors were staunch Republicans; just as I had suspected. You can pretty much tell who those people are in my neighborhood by a cursory inspection of their homes. My neighborhood is one of those, in the first throes of historical reconstruction. Those whose homes have already undergone refurbishing are pretty much conservative.  The poor are pretty much firm Democrats, with some exceptions! The exceptions are the Religious Right. This is pretty much a mystery to me. If Jesus had been born thirty-three years ago, I'm certain he'd be branded as an extreme leftist by the conservative pundits today. I'm also just as sure that the televangelists would crucify him (they'd probably nail him tighter to the cross than the Roman soldiers did two-thousand years ago; just to make sure he never rose from the dead). In short the money-changers have returned to the temple.  More to the point however, I walked up to the home of one of one of my neighbors who I knew was a disabled veteran (and not very well off I might add). I was not prepared for the reception I received. As soon as he saw my Kerry shirt, I was bombasted with a long line of expletives, followed by: "Are you for Kerry? I won't vote for Kerry, he ain't no Christian. Bush, now he's a Christian. No I won't be votin' for Kerry. I'll be votin' for Bush, he's a Christian!  I didn't even try to change his mind in the least. I've run up against this mindset before, (in fact I was reminded of how Jesus himself felt when people were so willingly blinded by false belief). They believe what they're told by the likes of Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Robertson, Falwell, and on and on and on.....oh yeah, let's not forget the pastor of the local [insert brand name here] fundamental bible believin' church.  Now before I start getting a bunch of flaming hatemail, let me explain that I have no axe to grind with Christians as such (some of my best friends are Christians...), what I don't get is how someone could call themselves Christian and still back the Bush-Cheney ticket. Neither one seems to me to be very much like Christ at all, yet the very meaning of the word Christian is "little christ".  Seeing as how the bible very explicily states; "by their fruits ye shall know them", I'd like to invite you to compare Bush-Cheney's actions with Jesus' teachings in the following article by Ernest Partridge, entitled:          "What would Jesus Do?"

						   John Kerry tells the Unity conference of minority journalists in response to a question, that if he had been president during the al Qaeda attacks on New York, he would have handled the situation differently.  Here is what he told the unity conference. "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to -- and I would have attended to it."  According to the 9/11 commission report, the President took between 5 and 7 minutes before reacting to the news from White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card that a second hijacked jet had crashed into the world trade center.  Our country is under attack and the president continues to read a children’s book?

						   I don't know about you, but I was more than a little pissed off at the coverage of the Democratic Convention. "MSNBC is a little more liberal than FAUX", I thought, so I watched the coverage of Chris Matthews roll out conservative nay-sayers of every sort to trash every good thing anyone said. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not in love with the Kerry-Edwards ticket. I'll support them of course, but I'm a liberal-liberal, not a conservative-liberal. I have to use terminology like this, because the ultra-conservative pundits working for the Repubs can't see any middle ground anywhere and are busy painting moderate to conservative Dems as some type of "Old Europe" communists. For more info on where all of the 2004 Dem Primary candidates actually stand, check out  urlLink http://www.politicalcompass.org/  . But I digress...while watching all of the circus entertainment after the Al Sharpton speech, my body went numb and started to sweat profusely, I couldn't breathe. At first I thought I was having some sort of massive panic attack. Just then, a powerful force that felt as old as humanity took control of my body. I felt my hand move over to the remote and begin to push buttons all on it's own. Instead of my head spinning around and spitting pea soup, a strange thing happened. My hand switched the channel to CSPAN. I was awash with the enormity of it all as the mysterious force returned control of my body to me, materialized in front of me in the form of Lady Liberty, spoke three simple words, "Think for yourself!", then vanished. Okay, okay. Maybe  some  of that didn't really happen  exactly  that way, but I had to get your attention somehow! The point of all of this is that I really don't like some bobble-headed talking doll telling me how I'm going to react to someone's speech. Some  real , intelligent political commentary might have been nice, but only during the dance party, not during a speech that someone else thinks is not important enough for me to hear. Even though CSPAN is not really independent television I guess it's the closest thing we have for now, and they covered the convention pretty much in it's entirety with no commercial interruptions, and direct from the pundit free zone. If you're as concerned about the state of the media as I am, check out the Washington Monthly article written by Ted Turner at  urlLink http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html (yeah, yeah, I'm not a fan of Ted either, but he does have some substantive things to say). Then run, don't crawl over to Media Matters for America at  urlLink http://mediamatters.org/  and join in the activist network. Together we CAN make a difference!

						   Bush says in his July 31st radio address..."Because of my policy of strengthening the economy while enforcing spending discipline in Washington, we remain on pace to reduce the deficit by half in the next five years," Now the deficit is up 445 billion in 2004 from 374 billion last year.  Bush inheridted a 500 billion budget surplus when he came into office.  GO FIGURE!

						   The week before last, we saw the Department of Homeland Security deciding whether or not to go to Congress to ask for the power to cancel elections if terrorists attack or threaten to, before or during elections. "There, there now G-Dubya. A little worried about the outcome of the elections?" If we'd used the National Guard for it's intended purpose (guarding the nation) instead of spreading them across the global oil fields, we might not need this precaution. But then again, if we use the same tactics to win as we did during the last election, things are going to look mighty fishy... Activists for democracy all over the nation went into action writing their congressmen and women, airing their fears that we'll have an unelected president again... or still... or whatever. The fact remains that Dubya's party is still in power... and that would look fishy too. We  need  an angle. Car bombs on Wall Street? " Never before have we collected this kind of complete intellegence from the terrorists".   ORANGE ALERT! Plastic on your windows!More to come from the Dirctor of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge... HERE COMES THE FEAR!
