      When i started my industrial trainig, i realized that working life is ain't easy. No wonder i always got complained by mom saying that i should enjoy what i am doing now as a student. i think now i got what's the message my mom wanted topass to me... Still left a month and 3 weeks from now. I am really looking forward for my holidays... ^^

      Well, today i am thinking... Am I suit to be involved in  IT  field???  Ok...many of my friends... sure will shot me back that I am already doing my Final year if I am asking this question... So, I've learnt to be wise... instead of them what am I on the right track, I will simply ask them, What they plan to do after graduate... and i will start telling them what I've in mind... For me, I want to do something really unrelated to IT after this. I am totally a slow learner and totally will got brain washed right after each semester's Final exam... I knew that, " somebody " might think that I am totally dummy on anything regarding to IT especially programming line... no offense... I am quite blurred sometimes where i actually need the person to keep on repeating the same question to me... I am really really sorry if i've been trouble u guys out there... :(  Well, today i actually ask this Q (What u plan to do after our graduation)... she told me she wans to do something related to IT course to brush up her programming skills or mayb some lecture stuff...  But for me... no IT anymore...  Mayb I'll plan to take up Accounting...  Then i started to share her my thoughts of being a  fashion design ,  PR ,  journalis t...etc..  But the problem is... i m not good at drawing (maybe even worse), PR?? not good at communication skills (don't know really how to express well). journalist??? not good at writing 'coz my grammar mistakes can actually make u go crazy... I am thinking on taking the Professional Japanese Language and really master at it... after that, mayb I can get a teaching job by then??  Ermm...what about own my own business??? too risky??? actually we are taking the risk on the things we are doing now... I m kinda worried too much... n forgot that we actually can troubleshoot if we made mistakes... But taking the wrong path, can i troubleshoot it???  For a fren out there... thanks for ur companion n ur advice... i will really plan my future by now... as u said i am not  17  anymore... time dont wait for us... i'll feedback u when i really got my mind set... n wat u found in me really flattered me...thanks again &nbsp;*huggies*

      Another month left for training...  Time passes really fast, I still remembering that I am feared of the training session, scared that i can't perform well in it... but now it almost end... What i can say about this training is that... training not that scary anyway... we gain knowledge of life if not knowledge of wisdom.. really great that our University is giving us such a opportunity... Besides learning, we can meet more new people... from there i can observe how's a working adults actually&nbsp;behave and live their lifestyles so differently compare to us...For me, i think&nbsp;I still think that i do behave like a child *shy* ... someone who never grows up... *shy again*&nbsp;   After this... we need to back to campus for our lecture classes again... live our midnites styles, our supper at wee am in da morning???? !!! sounds crazy huh??!! but it's true...  students life is like this...when u are talking about the day, we are talking about the nite.. *winks*...   so which one do u prefer more???  I think i m going to miss my training session but at the same time i m looking forward my convocation day... so, i i'll choose to put&nbsp;on my backpack n let's back to school~~!!...ahhaha.. afterall we get to work anyway after graduation....hahahah

       The poor man is not he who is without a cent,    But who is without a dream   - Henry Kemp -   We, the speacial creatures on this planet...  Why are we so special????  We are special because we are able to think n act rasionally...  We have feeling... sometimes get very emotionally sad, mad or happy...  We able to talk the human language which is unique and understand among ourselves...  We have the 7 wonder things:  &nbsp; To hear    &nbsp;To see    &nbsp;To feel    &nbsp;To LOVE    &nbsp;To sense/smell    &nbsp;To think    &nbsp;To live    In order to live our life to the fullest, we should set our goals or dream...  so that, we will feel that we are worth a life here...  and we will enjoy whatever we are doing with the believe we will achieve our dream one day...  Everyday challenge is our nutrient for our growth.. ^^  For all my friends out there...  believe in whatever you do... give it all your best, and i am sure u will get the returns one day, someday...

            江南  曲： 林俊傑  詞：  李瑞洵      風到這裡就是黏 黏住過客的思念 雨到了這裡纏成線     纏著我們流連人世間 你在身邊就是緣 緣份寫在三生石上面     愛有萬分之一甜 寧願我就葬在這一點     圈圈圓圓圈圈 天天年年天天 的我 深深看你的臉     生氣的溫柔 埋怨的溫柔 的臉 不懂愛恨情愁煎熬的我們     都以為相愛就像風雲的善變 相信愛一天 抵過永遠     在這一剎那凍結了時間 不懂怎麼表現溫柔的我們     還以為殉情只是古老的傳言 離愁能有多痛 痛有多濃     當夢被埋在江南煙雨中 心碎了才懂    Nice songs :X:X

       Weather :  Sunny   Music playing on :  Tai Wei Qu by Momoko TAo   Mood :  Happy but a bit of headache    The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing but sand;    The angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they are gone.   -George Eliot -  What is written above is true. We always make mistakes by not realize how lucky we are... We always miss the chance we have by being so selfish to ourself... We always never realize when people are good to us until they walk out from the door our heart.. no longer turning back to us... By that time, we only started to realize how important the person in our life... but everything is already a past tense... The worse part is; whenever we started to being so dependent on that person.. Heart pain is even painful than heart attacting whenever he/ she no longer stand by our sides...

       Weather :  Hot   Music playing on :  River South by JJ   Lin   Mood :  Pain in my heart again    &nbsp; JJ Lin's second album really got improvement... I am totally being attracted to his new song called  River South.    I played the song over n over n over again...  Although i can't really understand whatit's all about, but i am sure this song most probably written to recall back the previous  LOVE   ...   What do u think of  LOVE ??    LOVE  is blind, therefore when people fall in love; they only can see two people in this world (one is their own self , the other one is their partner.   LOVE  can make us really sacrifies ourself just want to see the our love ones happy.   LOVE  sometimes can make us out of control.   LOVE  is no longer there when we start doing comparison with the others.   LOVE  needs chemistry.   LOVE  can make any women to feel happiness in this world.   LOVE  needs courage.   LOVE  is a very complicated human's psychology   LOVE  needs trust.   LOVE  is just a  LOVE    So what do u think of  Hate ?  To  HATE  a person is alot more difficult than to  LOVE  a person. I would rather to  LOVE  than to  HATE . To  HATE  a person will make ourself unhappy thinking of that's person we  HATE .&nbsp; The feeling of  Hatred  can be control by ourself... We are the captain of the 30,000 soldiers who will listen to our order... keep on telling ourself that we are happy, cheerful; nothing will block our way to become a cheerful person and i believe this way will help our hatred feeling just fade away... try this simple medidation to enhance your beautiful life...   Remember : let our brain/ mind to control our body, not our body to control our mind~   Happy Always!

        Truth is perfect and complete in itself. It is not something newly discovered; It has always existed. Thruth is not far away. It is nearer than near. There's no need to attain it. Since not one of your steps leads away from it.

      Time passes really fast... just a flash of light! 24 hours a day really not enough for us... 8 hours already taken for sleeping, roughly 3 hours for our daily meals (breakfast + lunch + dinner), 2 hours for reading the daily newspaper, 8 hours for working(training), 2 hours for watching television, 1 hours for travelling to our work place. Total: 8+3+2+8+2+1=24 hours.... where got time to rest our mind. Plus, 8 hours sleep realy not enough for me. I need at least 10 hours sleep to really make my mind clear or else i'll be a sleepy head and moody for the whole day. God should give us 30 hours oer day. GREEDY actually is just the human nature.  By the way, i am always plan to have a pet, maybe a hamster or something. *think* Maybe should opt for a dog. At least it wont die so easily...*laugh* Dog is the only animal i  think is loyal in this world... Don't mention their cuteness, they can really make upa very good companion to us...

      Sometimes, i feel myself is totally lost in this challenging world. Everyone seems to have a target in order to move on their life but not to me. Why am i behaving this way?? I don't know... And the worst thing is, i don't even know what am i doing now!!! This is really sulkening.  Targets , goals make people keep on competing to be better human being on this planet. When i ask myself, what's the target in myself.... i am absolutely no idea... people are quite shocked when they heard this because even a small kids know what they need to achieve.   There's thing i found out through my training is i dont suit in this ongoing IT world. I am asking myself , what makes me to take up IT course in the first place back in 3 years ago?? Because of interest?? because of no other choice?? I don't know! What i know is there is no turning point for me. What i can do is just finish up my degree and get the certificate. After that only plan which path i should go.  SUCCESS = HARD WORK + HARD WORK +HARD WORK

      Today, I had the greatest meeting in my life with the rest of my colleagues.  They gave me feedback on my three months performance which they have done the evaluation a week ago. I never know that I am actually that good to them. My supervisor said that, among the trainees they ever had, I am the best. This word “The Best” really boost up my energy to work even better for them. I am touch that they actually appreciated me during these 2 months. There another month to go to completed my training with them. Although just a very short period with them, I can feel that each of the staffs there are really work as teamwork and they keep on giving support to each other unlike mostly of the other big companies where colleagues gossip around behind others back. I really like to work with these people. During these times, I really learnt a lot experienced from them. They make me realized that whatever we do, we need to focus and always being able to adapt environment changes. The most important things are being able to plan well and clear what we are doing. I feel that everyday is a challenge for me. In order to complete my day, I need to beat my opponent to go on survive and of course this way, it will help me to overcome my every day’s fears too. Thank you  guys for such a wonderful time spent with me. ^^

       Weather :  Sunny   Music Playing on :  Mmmbop  by  Hanson   Currently I m reading on this " HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT AND WANT WHAT YOU HAVE " authored by  JOHN GRAY .  I came across to this topic which caught my attention this morning when i was in the cab on the way to work. It said that:   Our soulneeds different kinds of love to grow and express itself fully through the mind, heart and body, just as our body needs water, air, food, vitamins and minerals to stay healty.  There are ten  LOVE NEEDS / LOVE VITAMINS  to achieve personal success/ happiness and we need to open our heart to receive each of these  VITAMINS.    TEN LOVE VITAMINS :    Vitamin G1  :- Love and support from  GOD    Vitamin P1  :- Love and support from our  PARENTS    Vitamin F  :- Love and support from  FAMILY, FRIENDS, and having FUN    Vitamin P2  :- Love and support from  PEERS  and others like us with the similar goals   Vitamin S  :- Love and support from  OURSELVES    VitaminR  :- Love and support from  INTIMATE, RELATIONSHIPS, PARTNERSHIPS, ROMANCE    Vitamin D  :- Loving and supporting someone who is  DEPENDENT  on us.   Vitamin C  Giving back to our  COMMUNITIES    Vitamin W  :- Giving back to the  WORLD    Vitamin G2  :- Serving  GOD       I've learned something new today in my life... Showered a person with LOVE, CARE can brings such a great impact in their life...at least they will not feel alone living in this EARTH... keep on giving others supports.. it may not in $$$ but a word or two sometimes already good enough make the person feel appreciated~~  Thanks pals out here who always lend me their ears to my long long grandma stories and for those who always supported me in whatever i m doing.. and not forgetting mom and sis who r the one always being so patient and always showered me love that i need...luv ya all *muaacckkss*

I dunno what had happened in between, but i definitely can feel that she is really sad about it ... as her sis i cant do anything but to comfort her and encourage her to lift up her life coz life still goes on... This is not the 1st time she did it to my sis... frens should be care for each other, not to hurt among ourselves...i mean, what a fren for??? i really dun wan to interferein their conflict but i simply cant fold my arm n let other to treat my sis that way... i m not over protective her but if i can i will ask her to buzz off of my sis life nad get a life for her ownself... Really cant stand of those people who always think of their own profits n willing to sacrify us/our friendship to win the game...This kind of people will not really have friends or there's meaningless in their life.... believe me, they will not enjoy watever they are having/doing... it simply not enough for them... hope that my sis,May, will get over of this soon and may god bless ya~~ Wish that  frens or colleagues will not live they life this way~~

       Weather :  Starry nite   Music playing on :  7 Miles Fragrant by Jay   Mood:   Happy :D   Today woke up at 11 in da morning... can't really sleep tide this morning after back from seet's party...1st time ever karaok' till morning... it was really fun... and not forgetting the tequila pop that we had at SOul Out..heheh and i got a chance a to peep on a guy who really look exactly like Jay~ Gosh~~ but of course Jay is much better looking than this guy..hehehe.. Hmmmeppff... After 6 days work, it's really enjoyable to chill out with frens..heheh...  Reading back those testimonials from my frens n students in friendster really make me laugh...hhahha... erm... i think i shouldn't have put on my ear-rings on my 2nd n 3rd ear-pierced... this is not good if any students spotted it... hehehe.... actually, i dun feel like i m soft spoken, good or watever they said about me... but one thing for sure is i m a moody person. U can see me really cheerful in a moment and down like hell a min after that... When i moody, i just shut myself up... dun feel like talking to anyone else and this really tensed up frens around me... i am silent n din talk much when meeting up with new friends, so my 1st impression to that person,is really unfriendly, not sporting at all...ehhehe.. but to those who noes me....heheh....i can be really talkative, hyperactive (if too much caffiene), spoilt brat (coz i likes to manja ppl...muahhahah), i m always in the state of blur... hahaha... cant take it lei.... well this is real me...!

       Weather :  Sunny   Music playing on :  *i dunno what is it title, but it's a extremely nice song*  by  PU SHU   Mood :  Sleepy + Worried + Happy    Did you know that when you envy someone, it's because you really like that person?    Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart, are real weaklings and most succeptible?   Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?    Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I       love you,Sorry and help me    The people who say these are those that actually need them or really feel them, and they are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.    Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?     Did you know that those who dress in red are more confident in themselves?    Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy thier beauty?    Did you know that those who dress in black, are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?    Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?    Did you know that those who need more of you are those that did not mention it to you?   Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writting than saying it to someone in the face?   But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?   Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?   Did you know that if y ou ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?    Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.
