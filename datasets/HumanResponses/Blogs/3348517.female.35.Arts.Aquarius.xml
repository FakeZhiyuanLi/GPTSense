       The Impatient Body feels awful still.   The Impatient Body is mad at me for keeping it full of fat. The Impatient Body is not my friend now. It is making me unhappy. It is keeping me away from people. My husband tries everything and I simply do not feel like feeling better. He keeps on telling me what a hard and wonderful job I have done. How changed I am. He even made me wear this pants that fell off totally to make me visualize my loss. Nothing worked. Nothing works. All I can see is myself in that dressing room trying swimming suits. And the way I looked 5 years ago, when I had lost the weight, and before I regain it all back. Plus.  And I am afraid now. I am afraid I will loose it again just to gain it back.  I know I will get better. I just need to get in close contact with all this sadness now. Perhaps this is how I will work things out. Once and for good!

       When you have lost a lot of weight, things happen to your life. First, you begin to like what you see in the mirror in the morning. Second, you become more energetic and your mood and spirits rise. Third, you get compliments and support from friends and family and you feel prettier and you look prettier. Fourth, you get motivated and work harder towards your goal. Fifth, you are Greek, and it's the end of May and you have to start going to the beach because, not only you adore swimming, but most of the people who do not work like crazy as you do, have already started and their tan is showing, so you got to get a tan as well, cos more than anything, a tan suits your eyes and makes you look thinner too! And then...you go swimming suit shopping.  You wear your nice white linen pants, your new red t-shirt with your new red sandals, you admire your clean french pedicure, you take your gorgeous superfit husband, and hit the shops. Spirits are high cos hey! I've lost and am loosing this weight! And I look good today too! And my husband is full of compliments today!And then you enter the shop.  You pick 4 different swimwears and you hit the dressing room. And reality strikes with flabby white cellulite thighs. Reality strikes with huge arms. Reality strikes with loose skin and strech marks.  The blues instantly arrive with their hands full of goodies. So yeah, they say. You have gone from a size 22 to a size 18 bottom. And you have gone from a size 20 to a size 16 top. Yeah...I forgot! In the right skirt you can fit to a 16. And if the top is elastic, you have a couple of sizes 14 in your closet too! Yeah, UK sizes. But your skin is loose, your stretch marks show, cellulite is there, and you still look AWFUL in a bathing suit!  That happened yesterday. The blues are still here today :o(  No matter what, I am still fat. 90.3 kilos is still too much. And if I want to end this, I need to concentrate harder. And right now, I am not feeling strong. I feel tired and gloomy.

       This morning I didn't exercise. I was too tired. I came home from work at 1 a.m. last night. I had a 15 hour working day. So I woke up and made a coffee and sat in the PC to check on emails and blogs. And my all time favourite dg had a new post. Which always brightens up my day. She hit a nail again. And ever since I read through it and through the article she mentioned, I feel kinda angry and upset and concerned.   I read many diet blogs. I surf through numerous diet sites. A year ago I used to feel that for british folks, for australians and especially Americans dieting is such an easy thing. You have cooking spray, you have splenda, low fat chocolate, "Oh I can't believe it's not butter" stuff, you have 99.9% fat free brownie mixes, fat free sour cream, low colesterol stuff, and I could go on for ever.   I felt deprived in my little corner of the earth. I would check the incredibly delicious desert recipes in the weight watchers site and get angry cos I would never be able to make them cos half of the ingredients were not available in Greece. I would have to come up with my own, and be moderate in consuming them cos points were always greater due to the things in them.  During this year, my attitude changed. All it took was a documentary in TV. It was about cattle, chicken and pork farms. It was about genetically (oops I don't know the word! changed? mutant?) vegetables and fruits. It was pure horror. I remember waking up my husband, cos the documentary was at midnight, dragging him from the bedroom to the living room where we have the TV, and making him watch it too. He was complaining for waking him up for about 30 seconds. His complaints were substitued by silence and horror in his eyes. We stayed up an hour longer after the documentary, talking about things we saw, things we heard, etc. And decided to go organic.  But I am still confused about things. I am still trying to figure out why we do this to ourselves. Unless the very small percentage of people who die when they are too old, most of us die from illness. In our bodies. Which we feed crap!  I have a trillion things to say. I am so sensitive about this. In the last couple of years I have seen 3 people curing their cancers with food only. You think I'm a lunatic. Perhaps I am. But these people live a cancer free life now and I have witnessed it.  But I won't go on. I will only say one more thing. Last summer I was following weight watchers. And exercising for at least an hour a day for 5/6 days a week. And eating lot's of "diet" stuff like artificial sweeteners, diet sodas, low fat cheeses etc.   My exercise lately has been moderate. Nothing like the 6 miles in 45 mins in the treadmill, plus a weight session I used to do last year. I am just walking for 40 to 60 minutes a day. Sometimes these 60 minutes are done in 4 sets of 15 mins each, depending on my work load.  When I was 96 kilos last year, I wore a size 20 skirt, and a size 18 top. In 96 kilos early spring 2004, I wore a size 16 top, and a size 18 skirt. Last year my exercise was stronger. This year it isn't. So no, exercise is not the reason my body shrunk. Eating good quality food is the ONLY reason. Cos in my body there are no chems. My system doesn't retain water to cope with the chemicals and antibiotics and poisons in my food. My skin is brighter. My hair shine. And I will keep on getting into my friends' nerves and scream: GO ORGANIC!!!  Oh dear blog! Imagine what a pain in the arse I'll be when I quit smoking this coming September!!!  I won't spell check this one!

       My husband has one great friend left from his highschool years. I have known this guy for 16 years now and like him almost as much as my husband does. The last 5 years they kept their relationship between themselves. They would go to footy together, they would go for beers, they would work out together, etc. The last two years, they decided to involve the wives too. His wife is not my cup of tea, but I'm making the effort to go out with them a few times a month, cos my husband really likes the four of us going in places together.  Last night we were invited for dinner at their house. She called to ask me if I was still "watching my food intake". I told her that she shouldn't get into too much trouble, that I had already prepared food for the next couple of days, and I could bring something for me. "Don't be silly" she said. "A steak and salads are always handy in this household".   We arrived at their place at 9 p.m. At about 10 she started setting up the table. I moved to the kitchen and to help her and told me not to enter, that she'd do everything and I should just get myself comfy. So I did. The three of us sat on the table and waited for the gracious hostess to serve dinner.   First came three different kinds of salads. Green salad swimming in blue cheese dressing. Colourful peppers, cherry toms, avocado and pine nuts swimming in italian dressing. And a greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, capers, feta cheese and oreganon, flooded in olive oil. I exchanged glances with my husband. "It's o.k." I said to myself. "I'll pick some cucumbers and tomatoes, leave them on my plate for a while so the oil runs, and just eat my steak".  Then the main course arrived. A HUGE platter with 4 different kinds of pasta. Penne carbonara, penne al pesto, penne with red wine sauce and garlic, and spaghetti with cream and mushrooms. She presented with a smile and said: "I decided to feed you vegetarian tonight".  "Oh, then the bacon in the carbonara is fake I assume?" came my question. I saw the look of "Please, let her be" in my husband's eyes, and took a deep breath.  But I was so angry. Why on earth did she ever called me to ask me what I was eating?! Why she didn't let me bring my dinner?  I picked some al pesto pasta. It's just basil, garlic, olive oil and pine nuts smashed in a blender then mixed with the pasta. The less dangerous one. But dangerous still.  She was complaining I was not trying the rest to tell her how it tasted. I told her that the moans coming from the men's mouths were a good indicator. She said, "But you are the master cook, your opinion matters". I was ready to throw my iced water with ALL the ice cubes straight to her face. Then something clicked in me.  I took a single piece of penne in my fork. From the red wine sauce bunch. I brought it to my nose. I smelled it thoroughfully. I then said: "The wine is not dry enough. The garlic shouldn't be crushed cos it overcooked in the oil. Excellent choice of red pepper. Gives it this little something" and then smiled and said "Master cooks go by smells".  The guys laughed, she faked a laugh too.   This woman is slightly overweight. Has something like 10 kilos to loose. Every time we meet since I started loosing weight has always something nice to say. But with a smile that never reaches her eyes. And then complains about her not being able to follow a diet for longer than two days. Blah blah blah.  On our way back home, while we we're walking in silence, my husband suddenly burst into a loud laugh. "What's up?" I said. "Brilliant...BRILLIANT!!!" He exclaimed. "What is so brilliant???" I asked puzzled. "Master cooks go by smell!" He said. And then he hugged me and told me that it was so unkind of her to do this. He promised that next time we meet for food with them, it will either be a restaurant of my choice, or our home so I can cook. I tell you. It will be our home. And I'm cooking fish. And leaving all the skin and bones in it!!!!  This morning I am back at 90.3. T'aint a big deal, besides the fact that I didn't enjoy it. But I still can't understand why...

       I do my mind work. I do it once a week with my therapist. And I do it 24/7 a week alone. I do it with my husband. I do it with my friends. I do my mind work in front of the mirror, talking to myself out loud. I do it silently inside my head minutes before I drift to sleep.   I discover my demons and I confront them. And I confront them. And I confront them. With sincerity and devotion. And I confront them more. Deeper. And then, I confront them some more. And then I have a good number of successful days. And I think... aha! I confronted them! Strong and for good! Now I can forget about them!   It is then that happens. I loosen my guard, and the sneaky ones re-appear!   It took me years of yoyo-ing to finally accept the fact. My demons are unforgettable. My demons shall never go away. My demons are part of who I am. Confronting them is endless. I will have to confront them every single day. One way or another. The realisation of it made me feel tired at first. Is this something I will have to live with for the rest of my life? Isn't there a remedy? Something I will do, no matter how hard, and be done with them, for good, for ever and ever?  Then I thought of the latest confrontations. And the sweet feeling of accomplishment. And the bitter feeling of self disappointment. And how both of them make me feel alive and kicking. Each on its own way. Struggling, but with a cause.  Living a life is a full time job. I'm almost glad to announce that confronting my demons is a full - life job! It almost seems that the more things on my plate lately, the more variation I find in them.   I confronted my demon again last night. And the bastardious chocolate went from my hand to the garbage bin. Instead of second thoughts, I had a smile in my face. The scales thins morning said 90.2. Confronting a demon burns calories apparently *wink*

       are all subjects to a good decorator. They all depend on the decorative art.   Think. No matter if you live in a huge mansion on a small flat, no matter if you have a huge garden with all kinds of flowers or just a pot with one plant in your tiny room, you very well know that taking care of how it looks makes all the difference. The colours, the arrangement, the candles, an old wine bottle with a single rose, a painting, a nice throw over a boring sofa, the little ceramic cat you brought from a trip, they all make the difference.   Think. You wake up in a tidy and beautiful home and your spirit rises. You come back to your little room and the sight of your plant highlights your entrance. You buy a pair of extremely cheap but oh so funky candle holders and you go back to your flat all excited to light them up and enjoy your evening.   And think again. Why would decorating ourselves be any different?  Tall, short, skinny, overweight, blonde, brunette, redhead or bold, we, like houses and gardens, need our "decoration". We all know how differently we feel when we take some time and care for our appearance. Our self esteem rises. Our smile shines. Our mood suits our appearance.  Lately, I have the effort to seriously take care of my appearance. I am trying different combinations with my clothes. I used to wear my red shirt with my black and grey pants or skirts. Yesterday I tried it with a brown skirt. Don't roll your eyes and rush to call me colour blind! They were so warm together!   I still wear my hair in a pony tail. But instead of my usual elastic bands, now I am using old, worn - out scarfs that were in a drawer for ages and were never worn till now. The silkish feel of the scarf on my neck gives me a good sensation all day. And the bright colours of the scarfs make my face look brighter. I put on my make up every day. I carry my Mac clear lip-glass with me and re-fresh it on my lips every now and then. I paint my toenails and nails. I wear earings!   What I mean is that I am feeling better when I carry my 90.3 kilos in colour than when I carry them in a dull face with no make up and these little things that make the difference: accessories! Cos then, if I get a compliment about my appearance, I get more focused on improving it.  Yesterday I treated myself to an icecream. Yup, the ones I was talking about the other day. We went to our friends' house, and they asked us to get them icecreams. So we did. On the shop, while I was looking into yogurts, I decided to treat myself to an icecream cone. It has been about 6 weeks since I had something sweet. I decided that deprivation is a sneaky evil that leads to binges. And one icecream a month won't harm me.   I hopped on the scales as soon as I woke up. And yes, it didn't harm me at all. And I felt so good about it, so relieved and content, I walked an extra 15 minutes this morning. And decided on buying an elliptical machine.

       I promise you, it is!   On my way back home from work yesterday, I decided to not take a taxi, but walk for half an hour, and then take the bus. I finished at 10 p.m after a 4 hr meeting about a congress I am organizing for October '04. So walking was necessary for me to vent a little, or else my husband would be on for a very tensed Friday evening!  Now, summer is close and besides all other stuff, summer is icecream! One of the major icecream makers in Greece is one of the Great Sponsors for the Olympics. That means that there are huge icecreams everywhere. You see them on billboards, you see them on buses, you see them on TV, you hear lusty voices describe them in the radio. I had an apple for breakfast, 2 barley crisps with a tomato and some feta cheese and a growling stomach when I was surrounded by all those humungous icecreams. I was thinking I wanted one so badly.   Then my mind went through various dieting methods. I read about the quickness of SBD in so many blogs. Atkins is still resting in a piece of my mind. Weight Watchers are always an option. Fasting worked well for me once. Eating the same thing for 3 days in a raw - three days only protein, three days only carbs, three days only fruits, three days only veggies - had also very fast results. A friend is doing some weird diet a dietician gave her but she can have 3 icecreams a day, well, the 0% sugar 0% fat ones, but still...3!!!! Another friend is eating whatever she wants till 6 p.m. and then only drinks some weird enhanced green tea and she has lost lots of weight. Her lunch is always huge and fattening, fast foods, mexican, pasta, you name it. And she has lost something around 6 kilos in less than a month. I was thinking what would be the best fat burning exercise. Elliptical or treadmill. Early in the morning or whenever. I then saw a billboard with a slimming cream advertisement. I went mentally over all the brands I have heard of and I was wondering, if I was to use one, what should I choose: the anti-cellulite ones, the slimming ones, the firming ones? Then I got upset there aren't any creams that do all 3. Kill cellulite while slimming you by 2,4 cm (it kills me when I see this on TV..2,4 cm in a month!)and resulting in a more firm skin. Oh, and then I remembered the one that is supposed to "erase" strechmarks! Now I had bloody four to decide on!!!!  Half hour of walking and I was more tensed than when I left my meeting!!!  When I was in the bus, there was a young woman sitting in front of me, with a little girl, about 4 years old. They were quite a pair. The little girl was as charming as her mom. And it was in a very funny mood and they were exchanging jokes and I was watching them and they took my mind of my previous thoughts. As the people got off the bus - I get off at the last stop - and the bus got all quiet, I was watching out of the window, the city getting ready for a Friday night out, billboards with ads everywhere, neon lights, and then it stroke me!  Where did the logic went? We are Greeks for crying out loud!!! We were taught our philosophers at school. The ones that said "A healthy mind exists in a healthy body". The ones that said "Moderation is excellence" (and they didn't mean in spirit).   My stress deflated instantly.   I do not need to know any information about new revolutionary diets. I do not need to decide between elliptical and treadmill. Between early morning work outs and late night ones. And -THANK GOD!- I don't need to decide on which cream to massage on my thighs!!!   Actually, I wish I didn't know about any of this!!!!   I will eat right, and move. And keep believing that Ignorance is Bliss!!! And S T R E S S - F R E E !!!!

       It is past midnight in this corner of the world. 12.34 to be exact. And I got back from work half an hour ago. I hate days like this. My first appointment was at 10.30 am. And it went crazy till 7.30 in the evening. And then at 8.30 I had to be to an event by Votre Beaute magazine that gave some rewards to the best cosmetics according to their readers. Fancy evening I must admit. Super models, actors and actresses, the Mayor of Athens herself, tons of celebrities and press. One of my clients is a radio station, and we were the media sponsor of the event, so we had to be there. There was lots of champagne, and wonderful finger food at the reception after the awards. I didn't touch anything. I had two glasses of water. It wasn't hard, I wasn't that hungry. I was kind of upset and restless to get back home. And now I'm finally home, my husband is asleep :o(  I know I know, I should go to bed. And I will...soon. I'm totally knackered, but wanted to smoke a cigarette and relax a little, remove my make up and...post!!! hehehe I am getting a new obsession me thinks!!! As if I didn't have enough already!!!  I have to report eating great, though I've skipped a meal. I had breakfast, a very late lunch at 4 p.m. and I had an apple, strawberries and a little cantaloupe when I got home (actually I am finishing it now). No "official" exercise, but so much walking between appointments, and an hour of window shopping (and some actual one too) with a girlfriend before lunch was enough for such a long and tiring day.  So now...all I need is to feel some warm flesh and cool sheets next to my skin. This woman is going to bed. Good night!!!!

       I woke up this morning at 9am! I had set the alarm clock at 7.30. I don't know what happened! I got panicked the moment I realized the time. My plan was to wake up at 7.30, drink my coffee, go for a walk, get back and shower and get ready for work. Instead, I woke up the time I was supposed to be in the shower!  In a different day, I would skip walking, and go on with my morning routine. In a different day, I would have an honestly good excuse.   But not today! Because as the thought of making my coffee and sip it slowly in front of the PC, while checking mails and surfing a tad crossed my mind, I thought of this blog. And the promise I made to myself to eat right and move as much as I can. So, I put on my running shoes, and went for a brisk walk of 40 minutes.  I went home feeling so alive and content!   So I was late at work. I was at my desk at 11.30. Big deal! First, it's my company! (well...50% of it ;o)Second, I won't be leaving before 8 pm. And last, but not least, with the mood I have had all day due to this 40 mins of walking, I have done more work than I would have done if I was here at 10 and feeling I let myself down for skipping my exercise.  I have to tell you dear blog. On my second day with you, you already fulfill your purpose!!!!  Oh, and eating has been good too :o)  Cheers for now!

       ...eager to go home and play with her new doll, the one she had dreamed of so long and finally acquired! This is exactly how I felt on my way home from work. I understood that when I realized how fast I was walking. And then I realized I was in a hurry to get home, turn on the PC and post!  I am puter illiterate I'm afraid. There are so many things I would love to add here and make it more like myself, but I dunno how.   Then it's the language. I know I speak English well enough, but being a foreigner I'm making mistakes all of the time.  It is also the vague fear of someone of my friends and family will find this blog and then?!?!?!  Additionally, it is the thought of not making it happen now and have my failure here in full quote for the world to see.   And still...I can't wait to get home and "post"!!! I must have been 7 years old when I got my first journal. All pink with dried roses and girlie frilly stuff. I am equally excited!  My eating has been great today. I had an apple for breakfast, and a black iced espresso, I had a 100gr piece of beef fillet with grilled zuchinnis, yellow peppers, and portobello mushrooms, with a little bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I had an apple for my afternoon snack, and dinner is getting ready: I'm making burgers with a big salad. Oh I am so obsessed with burgers lately. I have found a way of making 3 burgers with the mince you'd need for 1! I put zucchinis, onions, peppers, and fresh herbs in the blender, mash them, and make a veggie "mince" which I add to the beef mince. The burgers are so juicy and tasty with all those veggies! Mmmmmm.... And I bought a bunch of strawberries from the organic shop, so there is also dessert tonight!   I walked 3 km. Not much, I know, but work has been insane today.  Overall I am pleased. I feel this blog will keep me motivated. If I can journal my day here, I can review things and see what habits are to be formed and what habits are to be broken.  I will soon take my measurements and post them here. And there is also the new scales.AAARRRRGGGGHHHH! Panic panic!!! I got this new scales that measure fat and muscles and water and stuff. And I still haven't got the batteries in, out of fear they will show me something different than my current scales.  Ah its almost 8.30. My husband should be home in an hour or so. I feel like setting up the table with candles. And opening a bottle of wine for him. Yup, I am pleased today. I better go chill this wine for now...

       Measured in lbs, pounds, kilos, grams, stones, or whatever, how much excess weight weighs is absolutely subjective. My friend needs to loose three kilos and she feels as miserable as I was feeling when I had 61 kilos to loose. She would complain and whine and nag all the time bout the size of her ass...a size 10 mind you. But her anxiety and difficulty in committing to loosing them was the exact same with mine. Honestly.   I have been struggling with weight for many years. Now that I am almost clean of all other issues and weight is just weight to be lost for me I can say with sincerity that I have felt the same disgust with my body when I had just 5 kilos more and the same disgust when I had 61 kilos to loose.   For me, the important thing was first to lift the weight of my shoulders. By doing so I waved goodbye and farewell to 36 kilos of fat.   Tricky thing that was. The taste of accomplishment resembles that of tequila you know. And it is equally intoxicating. It drives you to cloud nine, and makes you feel on top of the world. And then you slip... And then I slipped. Fitting comfortably to a size 18, sometimes a 16, enabled me to go shopping and have a blast, feel beautiful inside my clothes, and good about myself. But it did disoriented me from my initial purpose. To reach a healthy weight range.  I got 25 more kilos to loose.  And I am going to loose them.  By eating right and moving as much as I can.   These last 25 kilos will not be a diet for me. It will be a life-style change. And I will share it with you, if you want :o)

       Lynda left a comment on my blog today. And she gave me the idea of today's post. My good ole story! At the end of her comment she said that I sound such a happy person. Truth is I am. Most of the time. But I have honestly worked very hard for it.   I had a good childhood. I had a good teenagehood. As a child I was skinny, but as a teenager I was not. But I was not really fat, though I had discovered comfort food. However, because I was dancing at the time (I was going to ballet classes since I was 4) I was what someone could call "pleasantly rounded".  I had an accident when I was 18 and I had to stay in bed for months and months. I started gaining weight. To cut the long story short, I have gained and lost the same 30 to 50 kilos 3 times in my life. The last time I was really slim was 1997, the year I got married. I was 67 kgs, and I didn't look skinny, but oh so pleasantly rounded again. I started gaining weight in 2000. Slowly at first. A couple of kilos, then 4, then I started moving a little, and then I met a new girlfriend. She was an homosexual woman. We instantly clicked and became best friends. My husband was working a lot at the time. He would leave home at 6 am and come back at 10 in the evening, eat, and sleep. He was relieved I had found a new girlfriend to keep me entertained. I grew fonder and fonder of her.    Again, to cut the long story short, I fell in love with her. It was so strange to me, because I had never feelings for women. Nor have I ever had again after her. We became a couple. I left home, moved in with her, spend 2 wonderful months together, and then things became ugly. With her, and with my family. Although I had asked for a divorce, my husband asked me to give us another try. So I went back home, with my self esteem down the drain, my heart broken, my guilt built to its highest levels, and tons of disgust for myself.  I returned to the low feelings I had at childhood. Only I never realised them back then. I was the first child in my family. I have had a great childhood from two loving parents that did the best they could. I was the queen of the world till my little bro came. Then I went to school. I was such a great student, that I was once again the queen and I started blooming! In the meantime, I made peace inside me with my brother's existence, and realised that I loved him so much. (My brother is now my best friend and has honoured me with a wonderful niece and a gorgeous nephew :)  Before he went to school all family friends and relatives had been telling him that he better be as good as I was when he starts school. So he suddenly became dyslectic. He was repeating letters or whole syllables when talking. My parents took him to a child therapist and he told them that they should make him feel special by turning all their attention to him. He even called me for a session and told me that my parents love me too much and that aint too nice for my little brother, so although they will go on loving me, they should not show it to me as much, so that my brother will be cured. I was six, and my mom still is afraid to give me his address cos she knows I WILL go bomb his place!!!  Anyway, apparently back then I had formed a belief. When I was wonderful and my parents loved and admired me, when I was doing wonderfully at school and my teachers and all appraised me, I was harming my brother, resulting in making my parents sad. In fewer words. My being wonderful should be camouflaged cos it had a bad effect on people I loved.   So when I returned home to my husband, I felt I was such a bad person, that I went into a depression, that would only go away with food. I would go to work, return, and eat, and eat, and eat. At the end of this circle, I weighted at 130 kilos. I had gain 60 kilos in about a year.   Luckily, in the middle of this period, I begun to see a Somatic Phychotherapist. Every day when I wake up, I remind myself to build this man a statue!  I went deep inside me. After tons of garbage I slowly begun to like what I saw. I came into peace with the forever existing issues between mothers and daughters and fathers and daughters and sisters and brothers. I begun to form a very close relationship with my body. I begun to learn how to stop thinking and begin feeling. My entire world changed. My priorities in life changed. I used to believe that work came first, then me, then the rest. Now, my husband, family, friends and myself come first. Work is just the means to pay the bills and the occasional shopping spree. As a young woman, I had developed a concrete theory about not wanting to have children. Ever. I actually believed that noone should have, till we run out of orphans in this world. See, I had to be nice and think globally so that people wouldn't think I am a selfish bitch who wants to do as she wants when she wants and that's why she didn't want to have kids. Big fat bullshit. I was scared to death. I was feeling incompetent. I was feeling unstable. And I was a selfish bitch!   (I am still spending 50 minutes a week in my therapist's place. I feel I still have a long way to go. I want to be as clean as possible from the past before I become a mother. I suspect that the remaining of the road will be more roses than thorns. We will see...)  Through all this roughness, my wonderful husband stood by my side. I was fat and ugly and he would tell me how sexy my ass was. I would get mad at him and scream and yell and call him a liar. He meant it. I am blessed with a man who loved me equally fat or thin, nice or disgusting. Now I can appreciate it. Before I was not able to really admit anything as deeply nice as this.  Anyway, somewhere in 2001 I saw a dietician. Ever since, I have been loosing weight. I have tried different metthods because I like diversity and get easily bored. From that strict dietician, I moved to WW and in March to a holistic doctor. Currently I am following his basic directions and sort of maintaining, but I am seriously considering WW again, because I need some "fun discipline" and toying with the points was that for me. I have periods of non dieting and regaining some back, I have periods of brilliantly dieting and dropping the kilos like a star, and I have periods of learning to maintain.  I fell in love with my husband all over again - we first got together when I was 20 years old - and we are both working on our marriage every single day. We learned that a marriage is a full time job and needs constant commitment. We learned it the hard way and we appreciate it more cos of that. In September my business partner will give birth to her son and after October 10, when I finish with this big congress I am organising, we will start trying to have our baby.  If someone told me 3 years ago that on June 25 2004 I would feel the way I feel, I would believe the things I believe, and that I would be who I am, I would have laughed at their face. Hard. Unkindly.   I am no more afraid or ashamed to feel proud of myself about my achievements. I am no longer feeling guilty for my doings. I honestly regreted what I had to regret. I sincerely apologised to whom I needed to apologised. I am no longer avoiding compliments. I know I will loose the remaining 20 something kilos. In 6 months or 16. I don't care. I know for sure that I will not gain the 40 I lost through out these 3 years. NEVER AGAIN!  I also know, and I let you know too, so you won't form the wrong impression for me, that I am weak. I have ups and downs. I have wonderful days and mediocre days and bad days too. I have mornings that I wake up and feel refreshed and have a great work out on the treadmill, and a fantastic day at work, and eat brilliantly, and have extrasupergreat sex and feel that on top of the world and know, really know that there is nothing better in life than life itself! And then, I have a long working week with tons of crisis and fights with my business partner, and I want to kill my assistant, and eat poorly, and miss a couple of days on the treadmill and feel bad and disappointed of myself, and my husband comes home late from work and I whine and get grumpy and refuse his hugs because all I want is to be left alone and whine and whine and whine. After all I have had 32 years to built my world, and less than 3 to "renovate", so I still have to get used to the newly formed habits of living. But I know, and you should also know, that I am not giving up on me. Because I have learned, the hard way again, that giving up on me, is giving up on the gift of life. And this is an insult. And of all the things I have done in life, insulting life is something I shall never do again.  P.S. Through the last couple of years or less, I have been reading so many diet blogs. To some of these wonderful women out here, I have sent emails with parts of my "how I became an elephant" story. This is almost the whole thing. Almost. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

       Believe it or not, they were all related!   The Weekend : By definition, it is time to us. It is time to do what we don’t get the chance to do during our working week. Even if it is laundry, it means that though tired at the end, we will be happier because all our clothes will be wearable during the week! This weekend was fun for me. Beautiful places, beautiful weather, beautiful people. Beautiful food too! Grilled goodies, such as fish and meat and veggies and pita breads and seafood. Iced goodies, such as fresh fruit juices, iced teas, iced coffees, ice creams. Which leads us to …   The Red Notebook : It worked partly. Because each time I wanted to have something I should not, I wrote down the reason. Usually it was because I was in a great mood. I was content, I felt beautiful, I felt “normal”. I did not feel the “fat” one. Not because I was not. I was the heaviest of all in the group. But I really felt equal to them. I do not know the reason. So when someone suggested a beer, I would drink a beer if I felt like having one. So conclusion number one says that I tend to overeat when I am either in a very bad or very good mood. In the first instance I have a gap to fill, in the second I loosen up enough to feel “normal” and loose my control. (parenthesis: where we went it was a big beach, and an all day long beach bar where we had breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, coffees, everything, so we went nowhere else besides our room). If it was during between 10 am and sunset, and I caught myself wanting something “naughty” to eat or drink, I would write it down, write why, and then hurry to my beach umbrella (is it correct English? The huge umbrellas you have in the beach so you sort of get protection from too much sun?). I would then apply the solution for my craving:   The suntan lotion : Yes. It is correct English this time. Because each time I felt I was ready to eat or drink “bad” stuff, I returned to the beach and applied suntan lotion. I enjoyed how much better my skin felt. I appreciated how smaller my thighs felt. I laughed because of the smaller quantity of the lotion it requires now to cover my body compared to 40 kilos ago. Then I went in the water. And I cherished the feel of the sea. I felt proud because I could swim faster and longer.  My husband laughed all the time, because in the middle of a conversation while someone was ordering a banana split, I would get up and run to our umbrella, as if I was hit by a bee!  But then the sun set and it was time to get back to our room, and shower and get ready for the evening. We then returned to the beach bar – café – tavern – grill – pastry house, met the beautiful people, sat all together and someone suggested ordering a round of frozen margaritas. It was then the first problems started. Because there was no way I would run in my umbrella and apply sun tan lotion! And because I’m a sucker for margaritas!  Quick thoughts quick thoughts! Red notebook! Alcohol calories! Fun! Feeling content! But oh the weight gain! If we start at 10 p.m. with margaritas, then we will go on with wine, and then food and then desert, and oh my god! What if we move to tequila shots after? What will I do?! I was writing all this in my little red book when the decision came all by itself – or at least it felt this way: Drink, eat, enjoy and then … do a lot of Strenuous Exercise! Which leads us to ….   Sex:  I had such an evening! I felt so good about the decision to go with the beautiful peoples’ flow, that I drunk 4 margaritas, 3 glasses of wine, and 6 tequila shots. We ate grilled fish and shrimps and salads. I shared a frozen tiramisu with another woman. And we danced the night away! And this wonderful day left us all relaxed and happy. And that entire dance left me and my husband in a very sexy mood. Which made us have sex till dawn! I slept for a few hours, then woke up, had a fruit ‘n’ yoghurt smoothie for breakfast, swam a lot, did the run-to-the-umbrella-and-put-on-sun-tan-lotion trick, had a huge salad with a little fish for lunch, and luckily, when the sun set, we left!  On Monday I hopped on the scales and I was 89.9. I gained 100 grms during the weekend. And I promise you. With what I drunk and ate, it should have been more than a whole kilo! But the great weekend, the little red notebook, the sun tan lotion, and the few extra rounds of sex did the job!  I concluded that once in a little while, it is worth going overboard. All it needs is a sort of “crisis management” and the right scheme to go with it. Eat more, move more. Enjoy the occasional splurge but take action towards it not being harmful, to both my weight loss efforts and mainly to my mood. I don’t need guilt. I had tons of it. It didn’t lead me anywhere nice. Plus I feel that when I have a “normal” person’s weekend, it sort of teaches me about maintaining. And for me, someone who has lost and re-gain 30 to 50 kilos 3 times in her life (and I am not counting the lose 5 to 10 regain 5 to 10) learning to maintain is precious.  That was my weekend. I was too busy at work to post before. And I had some time this morning so here I am all wordy, lol! I am still doing my 30 to 40 mins in the treadmill every day. I am thinking of re-joining WW for the summer. I feel I need some more discipline. I will think about it some more. Probably in-between my trips to the umbrella during this weekend. We will visit my parents at their summer house. And go to a wedding on Sunday. I will see you all tomorrow. Cheers for now   P.S. That was a looooooooong post!

       It was very warm last night. I think it was the first really warm and humid night for this summer. You know, one of these nights when you don't want to sleep, you don't want to talk,  you just want to sit in the balcony and breathe, and feel all the sensations summer nights bring: The joy of a sudden cool breeze, the smells of jasmine and basil, the quietness of the city, the clear sky full of stars, the anticipation of the holidays by the sea.  This is exactly what I did last night. I sat by myself in the balcony and breathed. Long deep breaths that relaxed me. Got me all mellow and calm. And then, I thought of something.  In all the weight loss journals and blogs I read, there is always the issue of weekends. In my own long experience of dieting, there is always the issue of weekends.  We all have perfect weeks. That unfortunately last Friday night. Or Saturday night. Or at its best, Sunday morning. We all tend to go overboard at some point during the weekend. Why?  I asked myself this question. I could not reply it immediately. So I asked myself another question.  What has food been for me?  Food has been comfort. Food has been a way of venting. Food has been filling emotional gaps. Food has been entertaining my boredom. Food has been covering my anger. Food has been an outlet. Food has been relaxing. Food has been fun. Food has been involved with most fun things in my life: dinners with friends, celebrations, holidays, vacations.  And weekends are for venting after a hard working week. Weekends fill the gaps caused in my emotional needs by a hectic week, because weekends give me more time with my husband and friends and family. Weekends are comfortable. Weekends are entertaining. Weekends sometimes make me peculiarly angry because they last so little. Weekends are fun because we go out, have friends over for dinner, and enjoy our time.  So weekends tend to be food!!!  Now if only I was able to separate those two! But I am hopeful. Now that I cleared this in my head, now that I found some kind of relation to them, I am hopeful.  So I will challenge myself this weekend. And you will be my witnesses.   My husband and I will go away to a small village by the sea, a couple of hours drive from Athens. This is my challenge:  Take my little red notebook with me, and write down all the times I feel like eating something I should not, and why I want it. See what are the specific situations I feel like going overboard.  You think it will work?

       So I won't have to work anymore! You know on Monday I slept from 6 am to 8 am on my office sofa! I was working from 10.30 in the morning till 6am! I also worked all Saturday and a few hours on Sunday too! And I am not rich either!!!  So if I can't win the Lotto - since I am not playing anyhow - can I get a job somewhere please? A nice 8 hr job with a bit of an overtime - so I keep my workaholic nature satisfied - that will pay me nice and give me normal holidays, leaves, sick days and all?  When I was offered this partnership, 2 years ago, I was thinking that having my own company with a partner would make me the boss. That it would give me freedom to come and go. HA! I was tricked by the bosses I used to have! They were either working for a bigger boss, or they had a loyal employee like me to do all the shit work...lol Now I work more, make less, and sleep in the office sofa!!!  On the weigh loss now, I waved goodbye to my water gain, and I am back to 89.8. I havent eaten brilliantly but not bad either. I missed the treadmill yesterday, but I carried boxes containing 6.000 2nd announcements for my congress. I carried them from the office to the car, from the car to the pavement, and from the pavement to the post office. The entire weight of these boxes (as the man of the post told me after weighin them for me to pay)was 174 kilos. I did 12 rounds to carry all the boxes, and I did 3 trips with them so that counts as a work out, doesn't it? (Please say it does!)  Then I did some retail therapy. I finished from the post office at 8 pm and the shops close at 9, so I spent a good 30 minutes in Marks & Spencer. I bought a cute skirt, a t-shirt and "roll of drums" another bathing suit! 2 piece please! And WHITE!!! Nice high legs bikini! I have a nerve don't I? hehehe I figured that cellulite, flab, strech marks and all need a bit of pampering after how bad I treated them last time. Last time I wear a white bathing suit I must have been 2 years old...lol  My husband liked it a lot and he told me that to celebrate my good mood after buying a bathing suit, he is taking me away for the weekend, so I can work on my tan! Bless him I say!  I want to thank you all for leaving comments on my blog. It makes such a difference. But you have to know one thing. I am puter illiterate. This is why this blog has no pics and fun stuff. I don't know how to add them!!! So unless you leave a url or email, I have no idea how to contact you and thank you personally! Tis all Greek to me ... and so am I!!!  Have a great morning, I am going to shop for fabric to make a dress for my nephew's christening beginning of July. Ah...lol...the occasional merits of being the boss ;o)

       It is horrible you know. Even when it is totally rationalised, even when you know it is not real and it has a very good reason for its appearance, even when you have all the credentials you need for its fast disappearance, even when your mood, your head and your body all scream water retention, a gain is always a gain!  I woke up this morning, and because yesterday I did an extra 20 mins in the evening in the treadmill, and because I ate exceptionally well (for a good dieter) for dinner, I thought I'd might see a few more grams gone. Yeah right missus!  Tough luck! There was a gain of 1.2 kg!!!! Yes I know! Tain't possible!!! One can't gain a kilo and two hundrent grammars in 24 hours when they eat fruits, veggies, and a nice lean grilled fillet, and they walk 7 km in the treadmill. They can't...can they?   Unless ...they have back pains...and the cramps begin...and their period is coming in the next couple of hours!  So I know. It is not a gain. But it is still a gain, if you know what I mean. It is a friggin number that makes me upset to see, even if I know it is not really real!  Bottomline is that in my present hormonal (this is greek for full of hormones..hehehe) state, I can realise that although I do my hard work, I am still subject to ups and downs, just like my body! And I occasionally need a good ole whine!  P.S. Ladies, thank you for taking the time and for having the kindness to support your Greek fellow looser. You are gems!

       I thought about it a lot last night. I dare say I thought about it long and deep. I came to various conclusions. First, dilemmas make us who we are in a way. Because our choices show who we are. From the t-shirt we wear, to the partner we choose to spend our lives with, to the professional path we decide on walking at,to the ripe tomatoes we pick at the farmers' market, to the colour of our hair, it all determines and all is determined by one thing: who we are.  Second, for me, as a woman who works towards loosing weight, dilemmas have a certain taste. "Should I eat this ice-cream or eat some melon instead?" "Should I add some grated Parmesan in my pasta or let the fresh tomato sauce conquer my taste buds?"   You see, I am waiting for my period. I am not PMSing severely this time, but I have  huge  ice cream craves.   Last night, I wanted one so badly. It was funny, because I hadn't realised it till my husband burst into a loud laughter. We were watching a debate in television about the Euro Elections and each and every break had icecream commercials. I was moaning harder and harder the more of them came. So he asked me if I wanted him to go get me some ice cream. My wise man is oh so nice and sweet the few days before my period...lol  I told him I want to think about it for a few minutes. So I got up and went to my study, sat down and thought about it. My dilemma: To have an icecream or to not have an icecream.   The sensational taste of bitter chocolate ice cream attacked my taste buds. God I wanted it so bad. I could imagine its texture, smooth, melting inside my mouth, the coolness of it as it would slip down my throat. And suddenly, I had another taste fantasy!  Salty liquid on my dry mouth. Yes. The taste of my sweat as I'm trying to surpass myself on the treadmill. The taste of sweat on my dry mouth, dry from the extra effort of the last extra 5 minutes on a higher incline.  My dilemma tasted salty yesterday.  Today, I weighed in. I am 89.8 kilos. I lost 1.5 kilo since June 1st.   This morning, while on the treadmill, I had a salty taste in my mouth again. Not the sweaty one just. The happy tear extra salty one.   Cheers for now. I got to go back to working because I will leave early to go to the organic farmers market :o)

       I have been up since 5:45 this morning. For a sleepy head like me this is  weird !I wouldn't worry if it just happened today. But the last few days I woke up too early. I haven't woken up later than 7:30, including the weekend! Well, on Saturday and Sunday I had long naps in the afternoon, but still! My husband says its the morning exercise. It might be. Cos I'm in bed at night around 11 which is also weird for a night owl like me! Ah I don't know...it just feel strange to be 8 o clock now, and me having already watered the plants in both balconies (I have 65 pots!), having spent at least an hr online, having made breakfast for my husband, having prepared my lunch.  And now, as soon as I finish this...guess what! Its  treadmill  time!he he he   Since the day I got it, I have spent a minimum of 45 minutes and a maximum of 65 on it. Yesterday I tried something new too. I took two small weights and held them while I was moving my hands vigorously, as if I was marching in a parade! It gave me the feel of a more total work out, if you understand what I mean.   I don't see any change in my body after 5 days of exercise. I know that it takes about three to four weeks before it starts to show. But I can tell that the difference in my mood is amazing. I buzz with energy all day long, I am in high spirits, and I sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow! My eating is so much better! I have second and third thoughts every time I get a crave for something I shouldn't have. I remember all the puffing and sweating early in the day and I instantly feel that it was not for maintenance purposes, but for loosing, so I conclude I do not actually want the icecream that bad!    I had a great weekend too! Open air cinemas opened finally!!! I just love them in the summer! We saw Troy. It was a huge disappointment! A complete distortion of the original story! My poor husband who adores epic films has not yet get over it...lol.   I think I will get ready for my exercise now. This will be my 6th day in a row. And tomorrow it will be weigh in day :)

       It just stroke me this morning. A moment of enlightenment at 7.30 a.m. And yes...I love my sleep. And since I am working till at least 8 in the evening, I do wake up late according to many people. I don't go to my office earlier than 11 am, unless I have an early morning meeting. It's the industry I'm in that's working odd hours as someone would say.   But I woke up at 6.45 today. I'm going to the hair dresser's at 9.45 to refresh the colour in my hair. And I woke up that early because I wanted to walk my 30 mins in my treadmill. So I got up, put on my trainers, and on I was.  Usually, I would get up, drink my coffee, wake up, then do any kind of exercise. But today I don't have all the time in the world, so I went on without coffee. While I was puffing after 30 mins I decided to go for 5 mins more. And then it stroke me!  Last year, around June, I had discovered the merits of treadmill by going to the gym. Till then, I had numerous arguments with my husband who loves running in the treadmill. I thought the machine was totally stupid, worse than an exercise bicycle. I used to say ...right...if you want to run why not going to a park? He always tried to explain that the steady pace in the treadmill is what makes the difference, but I can be such a pain in the arse and pretend I don't understand sometimes! lol  Anyway, after a few weeks on the treadmill, I was secretly dreaming of having one at home, so I would wake up, get my shoes on, and use it.  Last year around June, I discovered my first weightloss journals. It was the wonderful Jo from N.Z., known as Kiwi Jo, and another incredible woman, Heather. I was so stunned by both of them. Their honesty, their struggles, their successes were there for the world to see, they were there for the world to get motivated! And I secretly dreamed to have a blog too.  Well...guess what!  Today, June 4 2004, I woke up, put on my shoes, walked on my treadmill for 35 minutes, made my coffee, turned on my computer, and sipped it slowly while I was posting on my blog!  Dreams come true. It is only a matter of timing! And really really wanting them!  Have a great day, I am having a long one, last appointment is at 8 pm. But my husband has discovered a new grill place and he is taking me there tonight for dinner at 11 pm. Yes yes I know...way too late...lol  Well...us Greeks eat late ... lunch is around 2 to 3 in the afternoon, and dinner never before 10, especially when its dinner out!

       Since 9.30 this morning I am in an omg!omg!omg! state!  My doorbell rung and I was all excited already because I was waiting my elliptical machine to arrive. And it arrived! And it wasn't an elliptical! It was a  treadmill !!! My husband arranged with his friend to get me a treadmill!!!! I don't even want to estimate the difference in spending! But he reassured me that he will pay it in a year's period, so it isn't too bad!  My husband told me to consider this an early anniversary present (we have our wedding anniversary on June 28).   I am so excited! Not only because of the treadmill. Mainly because of the faith he has on me to purchase me something like that. My husband is a very practical man. He would invest on something that is going to be used long enough to worth its money.   I have to work...but I will be back later.  Oh...and!!!  Exercise for today:  35 mins on MY treadmill Speed 4.5 - 6.2 (kph)- 0 incline 10 mins on MY treadmill Speed 3.6 - 4.5 - 5% incline  Food so far:  breakie: 4 apricots lunch: 2 tomatoes, half a cucumber, half an onion, 4 olives, 60 gr. of feta cheese, spearmint, basil, parsley, 1.5 tbs of olive oil. dinner is planned and it will be: green salad with 1 tbs of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and grilled beef fillet I may have some melon too.

       I am home and will be for a little while before I go to a Press Conference, scheduled at 9.30 p.m. I wasn't going to return home but while I was in the middle of a very demanding document at work, I realized that it is Wednesday, and not Tuesday like I thought! When Monday is a public holiday, I'm always a day back in my mind. Sad I count the week according to working days huh? lol...Anyway...Wednesday means The Organic Farmers Market!!! From 5:30 to 8:30 in the evening now it's summer. Which allows me to shop for fruits and veggies there and not from my usual organic shop.   This makes me happier, for many reasons. First, the variety is a lot bigger. Second, the prices are better. And last but not least, there are the smells!  The smells are I N C R E D I B L E!!! Cantaloupes, apricots, melons, cherries, they all fill the air with long forgotten smells. Tomatoes and peppers make my mouth water. And the herbs! parsley, basil, drill, spearmint, fresh sage, fresh oreganon, and so many others that make me dream of herb pies!!! (O.K. herb salads...not pies...hehehe)  My kitchen smells like a garden. My freeze smells like a garden!   I have eaten very well so far. Had the stuffed zucchini for lunch, a couple of apricots for breakfast, and 4 apricots just now so they sustain me till dinner, which is going to be a late one...I don't expect to be home before midnight. But I have planned it well, so I'll eat as soon as I get home. A big salad with tomatoes, onions, peppers, cucumbers, spearmint, basil, 60 gr of feta cheese, and a bit of olive oil.  Tomorrow I am expecting my elliptical machine!!! It is supposed to arrive around 10.30 in the morning!!! We went with my husband to his friend who is selling poisons to body builders (tis how I call all these protein stuff they scorf down)and has added a line of trainers too recently. He is his old high school friend I told you about the other day. Anyway, he gave me a pretty good deal on an elliptical machine...It's called Hammer I think...though I am not good with brand names.   I can't wait to post my official exercise too!!!   I got to get ready and go now. I am going to meet some people I haven't seen in a couple of years, people from a festival I used to work for. Now one of my clients is giving a concert in their festival, so I'm gonna see them. I'm a bit nervous if they notice the difference in me. Which brings me to the most serious question for today:   Which is the skirt that makes me look thinner than I actually am?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Oh boy...Cheers!

       I really do! Since yesterday something moved back to its original place. And I am not feeling lost or disoriented any more. After posting I left work to go to the dentist. I did my last two fillings and I can now proudly present a clean and healthy mouth!!! (If you knew how scared I am of dentists you would clap your hands for me). Then I walked for about an hour, window shopping all that time. Well, some actual shopping too...I got a red polo shirt. The woman in this shop was horrible. You know the kind. In her middle 50's, dressed like in her early 20's, skinny with lotsa make up, and well defined triceps under her loose aged skin. I asked her if they had the shirt in Large. She said "No but we have it in XL". I said XL is big for me. She said "You're sure?" I said "I'm positive". I asked if there was possibility of calling and asking in their other shop if they had it in L, cos I wanted this particular shirt in red. She said it's left only in XL and M. I said...oh...then perhaps I should try the medium on. She looked at me as if I was from Mars, gave me the M and pointed her finger to the dressing room. I came out wearing the M shirt which fitted perfectly, and is slightly tight in the arms. She apologised. I paid. I was smiling when I got out. Not because I bought the shirt. Because her attitude didn't intimidate me at all!  So I came back home and felt like cooking something new and nice. I had taken minced beef out of the freezer in the morning, thinking of making burgers with grilled zucchinis and peppers for dinner. I came up with a new recipe and it was D E V I N E!!!  K..here it is, so I won't forget it! (Thank you darling blog for being my cook book as well :o)  Take 5 (or how many you want, but I got a man to feed and he is eating A LOT) big zucchinis. Cut them in half. Remove all the white flesh with a spoon and just the outside green part as thin as you can.   Take a non sticking pan. Put the mince till it gets a bit brown. No oil. Take the flesh from the zucchinis, a couple of bell peppers, a couple of onions, and a little garlic. Shred it to thin pieces and add them to the mince. Let it cook till it absorbed all liquids. Then take some tomatoes, put them in the blender, and add the tomato sauce in the pan. Salt, pepper, curry, cumin to your taste.  When the sauce is thick, remove pan from stove. Fill the zucchinis with the mince. Put in your pan some tomato juice and a little water. Still no oil or other fat! Put them in the oven for 30 mins, or till the outside of the zucchinis is tender. Sprinkle half of them with Parmesan cheese so your husband won't feel he is on diet as well. Eat the rest and moan from pleasure. Oh...Don't forget to leave a couple so you can take them to work as lunch!  The entire thing was made out of 400 gr minced beef, 5 big zucchinis, 2 bell peppers, 2 onions, half a garlic, and tomatoes.   And both my husband and I kept two halves each for lunch today.  I just love eating tasty,hearty and lean too!

       I almost forgot!  On Sunday and Monday I did not eat well. I ate some pizza, some icecream and a pitta - gyros too!   This was yesterday and the day before.  This was the past.  Nothing I can do now. Regrets won't benefit anyone.  This morning I went to the scales and I saw I gained one kilo. Bringing me back to 91.3  I tried to remember how happy I was when I saw 91.3 for the first time after years a few weeks back. And keep that feeling.  I managed. And this day has been great ever since. Food-wise, exrcise - wise, mood-wise too! :o)

       Please forgive me.  Forgive me for calling you impatient. Forgive me for hating parts of you. Forgive me for putting the blame on you. Forgive me for putting the blame ever. Forgive me for being ungrateful and judging you from your appearance and that only.  I would never do that to a good friend. I would never do that to any person. I don't know what happened to me that day and did it to you!  Instead of looking at your inner self, instead of appreciating all the things you do for me, I judged you from your appearance. I did to you what I hate others doing to me. Can you please forgive me?  Can you please allow me to thank you?  Each and every part of you?  Thank you skin. Thank you for covering my precious organs. Thank you for protecting them. Thank you for being the reason for all these wonderful sensations I feel when I am being touched. Thank you for the beautiful colour you get when you spend sometime in the sun. Thank you for the flush in my cheeks.   Thank you arms. Thank you for moving. Thank you for enabling me to hug my lover, my family, my friends. Thank you for enabling me to type and work, or else I would be in dept, cook or else I would not be able to express this part of my creativity, let alone feed my husband and myself, bathe or else I would smell, scratch my face, or else I would have to sustain itching, comb my hair or else I'd go like a mad woman, wash my teeth so that they don't rot and fall. I could go on for ever, but I am sure you understand.  Thank you thighs. Thank you for the sensations felt in your inner part. Thank you for carrying my upper body with precision. Thank you for protecting my womanhood. And thank you calves too! For working so perfectly harmoniously with the thighs and the feet and making me walk. Dance. Move. Run. Swim. Lay down. Climbing. Jumping. Making love. Knee to pray.   Thank you belly. Thank you for being elastic and able to expand so you can host my future child till it gets ready to come to this world. Thank you for the warm fuzzy feelings you give me when you are tickled.  And thank you my butt. Without you I wouldn't be able to sit, not to mention other things. I would be doomed to forever standing up.  And thank you kidneys and heart and lungs and liver and blood and veins and hair and nails and bones and ovalries and tubes and arteries and stomach and tenonds and muscles and I wish I knew all the words in english to thank each and every one separately. Thank you stretch marks because you showed me the limits of this huge wonderful organ called skin. And thank you fat, because at the bottomline, you are my fuel and you can be my energy.  Thank you body! Truly, really, deeply, and honestly THANK YOU!!!

       Lately I have been reading about so many diets. South Beach Diet and the non carbs alikes. And have been tempted a lot, because eliminating some foods but eating as much as you want from other is always sort of appealing to me. And the weigh coming in big ammounts, like in Atkins and SBD is always VERY appealing too.  It was then I remembered the Bank Account Concept Dr. M, one of the nutritionists I was seeing in the far away past, had so thoroughly explained to me once.  What is the Bank Account Concept one might ask.  I will try to explain it. (try, because I lack the bank terminology in english I'm afraid). So you all know these bank accounts that are attached to your bills. So your electricity and cell phone and rent and taxes and credit cards are all attached to your account and they get paid by themselves by deducting the correct amount of money. Now think of your account as being really low, with nothing in cos you neglected to put cash in it. And its almost the end of the month and you have bills waiting to be paid for a whole month now. What happens when you put money in your accounts is that the hungryformoney bills will absorb the money instantly and keep them in out of fear of you never giving them enough money again. (for the purposes of this you have to have some imagination, lol)  This is exactly what happens to our bodies as well. We leave them without carbs for a while, and the first bit of carb that goes in is instantly stored cos our bodies fear we will deprive them of carbs again. The tiny drop of olive oil in a body deprived of fats will be instantly stored because bodies needs fat and deprivation causes strain.  I went through this mentally for a long time last night. My husband was having sausages and I was thinking that if I was on Atkins I would be eating sausages dipped in Philly cream and I could feel my mouth water. And I was tempted to try Atkins again. I was thinking about butter and bacon and salomon and all the fatty things you are allowed in Atkins. Then I had this bad taste of ketosis in my mouth. The stiff mouth with the weird taste. I remembered one night years ago when I was trying Atkins that I woke up at 3 am, went straight to the kitchen and had 4 oranges. And I remember myself afterwards dipped fully in guilt cos I ate oranges! It was so insane! Oranges are good for me! Oranges are a gorgeous source of fibres, vitamin C and antioxidants! Butter is full of saturated fat can't possibly be better than orange!!!  Once again I asked myself again last night...oh golden balance, where are thy?  Tonight we will go to my niece's birthday party in my parents summer house. I'm curious what mom will come up with for me! And we are going to leave soon now and go shopping for sun tan lotions and holiday stuff. Exciting!!!!  Have a great weekend all!

       And it is so true. Yesterday I left work and went to a shop to buy my niece's birthday present. I walked to this shop for about 2 km, they told me the thing I wanted was out of&nbsp;stock there, and I should try to their other shop, which was "ten minutes walk" away in the same street. After 75 minutes of walking I decided to use the remaining 34 seconds of battery in my cell and call them and ask them where the hell the shop was. The man who answered the phone was laughing hysterically when I told him that I was told by their saleslady that it is a 10 mins walk. "I apologise ma'am, but she is new. She should have told you it is 10 km away down the same street". I was both laughing and cursing. Laughing cos it was kind of a cute mistake she did and proved a hell of a lot of exercise for me, since I was walking like mad because closing time was approaching, and cursing because I had to be in the dressmaker's to pick up a dress she is making for me. So I was there late, and had to spend&nbsp;30 mins waiting for her to do some changes in the dress because ... roll of drums... it was big!!!! Our last fitting was about 10 - 12 days ago, and the dress was bigger! :)   So I was home really late, around 10.45, totally tired by all this walking, and without Marie Claires and Elles and Vogues because I forgot them all in a plastic bag somewhere...the taxi?...the dressmaker's?...outer space?...I have no recollection at all!   I went to the kitchen and made a huge salad with tomatoes and peppers and cucumbers and onions and olives and feta, got undressed, put on my nightie and went to eat my dinner while watching some telly. I had about 4 pieces of my salad and I didn't want to eat anymore! I cut some watermelon, had again 3 pieces and wasn't hungry anymore! So what happened? I was puzzled. Cos I had a very small lunch too. And must have had 10 black coffees all day round. So either coffees and stress did it to me, or was too tired, or was having a normal person's appetite. We'll see ...   I went to bed a bit later than midnight, and woke up at 9 am with a kiss&nbsp; without having any memory of the alarm. A. was still home (last working day for lucky him) and he said "Wake up honey, its 9 am, you told me you have an appointment at 10!" Apparently, my alarm went on at 730, he woke up, I told him to let me sleep some more and make sure I am up at 830 cos I had an appointment at 10, he was trying to wake me up for 30 mins, and I was not even moving! And I do not remember a single word. I must be more tired than I think I am!   In the back of my mind there&nbsp;are food thoughts. Weird, unknown food thoughts. Thoughts about not having food. And it is strange and weird and unfamiliar. Does it happen to you too? From one period of having icecream and chocolate and pitta gyros constantly in your head to go to periods where food is just necessary fuel? The quantities I am consuming lately are smaller than usual. It makes me nervous cos I think that perhaps - since this is the first period I am alone at work without my partner and have this super extra sized work load - due to stress at work and all the increased quantities in smokes and caffeine I have lost some appetite. But it also makes me nervous cos I am afraid that if I go back to the quantities I used to eat while dieting, I will not be loosing but gaining!   Ah golden balance...who have lost you for me to find you...sigh....

       Yesterday it was not a non-exercise day after all :) After work, my assistant and I went to the post office for yet another massive send of our congress brochures. We finished around 7.30 p.m. and she had the idea of going for safe window shopping. Safe because shops in Greece are closed on Monday and Wednesday afternoons.. So we walked around the shops for a bit less than an hour, and then she had to go, so I decided to walk some more, resulting in 45 minutes brisk walk. I am pleased with myself!  Then I went home, made a deliscious chicken dish for my husband, and my veggies too, when I had a great idea about dinner. So I went to find my old WW points tracker, and saw the points for the amount of yogurt I am usually having, then looked for the equivalent points for feta cheese, and here is the recipe:  Grilled zucchinis, red yellow and green bell peppers, onions and eggplants Very ripe tomatoes Fresh oreganon Olives Feta cheese a little olive oil balsamic vinegar  All these mixed together spell divinity in capital letters! OH! and! Thanks Linda for correcting me! Linda said that my veggies are oven baked and not grilled! Which is more precise indeed!  So we were discussing our days with my husband when I told him that I went window shopping with N. and he asked me if I saw something I liked. See, I don't know if I had say this before, but our initial holiday plans involved a 5 day shopping spree in Amsterdam. We went there in February and the sales and shopping was amazing. So my husband said that as a gift for my progress we would go back in August, where the sales are even better. However, due to the Olympics, plane tickets have gone up crazy. We paid 200 euros each for the tickets and now they cost 598 euros each! So we decided that paying almost 800 more euros to the tickets would steal from our shopping, and that we better go again in February. But he has been really sweet and always asks me to go shopping for new stuff so that I celebrate the loss I have had so far.   So yesterday, that the shopping streets were quiet, I had all the time to really check things out. And I have concluded something that has really stunned me!  I am so very picky!!!!!   I had forgotten that about me. See, shopping with only one basic parameter in mind, and that being finding something that actually and simply fits, had me forget about so many things and especially style!  And now it feels like a whole new experience. Because, first, there are&nbsp; clothes that I never looked at as being unable to fit in. You know, capri pants, tank tops, cute feminine skirts&nbsp;in bright colours that their seam &nbsp;doesn't necessarily touch my toes&nbsp;, high heel sandals, cute gym wear. And dresses! Oh god the dresses! As a morbidly&nbsp;obese woman I never looked at dresses. I would look like a huge sack of potatoes in one! But now, as a semi-obese woman, I have found myself eying those dresses knowing they will fit and most probably look nice too.  A whole new world&nbsp;to explore! Beware Visa!   Today I did only 25 mins in the treadmill. Still got cramps. But had breakfast, and got lunch with me too! And tonight it's boys night out, so I will have my veggies and read a couple of Vogue's and Elle's and Marie Claire's and enjoy feeling totally vein thinking ONLY about clothes and shoes! (shhhhhhhh....and undies as well ;o)

       So my thyroid is fine. And so is my prolactine. But my progesterone levels are at the lowest end of the normal range and this is not too good. My doctor said that progesterone levels change through the cycle, but yet he can't give me an explanation why my cycle has shrunk from 28 days to 23 now. He told me it can be stress, it can be weighloss, it can be me thinking about it all the time. So he suggested that what I can do is a series of ultra sounds during my next cycle to monitor the progress of my eggs. I thought about it and decided that I will do it in September after I am back from holidays. In the meantime, I am seriously thinking about quiting safe sex, though we had decided that we would start trying from October, since I have my big congress beginning of Oct. and have to work like crazy.  First things first though, and having a baby is my priority!  I ate nothing all day yesterday. Not that I intended to. But when I arrived home at 9.30 p.m. and still hadn't heard from my doctor (too many ceasarians and child births the last 24 hrs :) when I tried to eat some grilled chicken I felt I'd throw up. My stomach was so upset from stress I didn't want to disturb it further.  And I didn't have breakfast either this morning, and I am thinking about food now and it still makes me sick. Perhaps I will try something later.  And last night I got my period too, so this morning has been cramps and no treadmill. The cramps are still annoying and today will be the first day with no exercise at all for me :(   I will do my best for more time than usual in the treadmill.  Thank you all for your warm comments, they mean a lot!  This is all for now, I better get back to work cos today I haven't been able to do much at that state of mind!

       I haven't slept well at all. I was stressing out all night about the test results I am taking this evening. It is 1.40 pm now and I want to call and ask in case the results turned in earlier than expected. I have thought of every possible horror story concerning my thyroid and fertility hormones.   I went home after work yesterday, got undressed as soon as I got in, put on my running shoes and got on the treadmill. Yeah, running shoes, and undies. And it was then I realised the exact amount of stress I have been on all day due to the bloody blood tests. Of course I was thinking about it. Of course I was wondering. Of course I thought I was stressing out 1% of what I was actually stressing out. Treadmill eased some of this tension, but not all.   Then we went to our friends' house, since my girlfriend got back from Chicago. She brought me two nice shirts size 12! I thought I'll save them for when I loose more weight. She asked me to try them on, and they both fitted perfectly! US sizes are so much roomier than UK or European sizes in general! I recently bought a shirt from Marks and Spencer and it is a size 16, which is a bit roomy, but 14 would be a bit tight. I wish there was a 15, it would be perfect for me!   I ate well yesterday. I mixed chicken mince with veggie "mince" turned out to yummy burgers. Some could say that I'm such a healthy eater. I say - and I know best - that I still like big portions for my dinner. So I grate lotsa veggies and add them to the meat mince and the quantity doubles. I also came up with a good idea for dessert last night. I had bought a couple of vanilla beans on saturday, and some really smooth tasting organic yogurt. So I took very ripe peaches, put them in the blender, scratched a big quantity of the vanilla bean in it, added the yogurt, blended all together, and put it in the freezer. I had some after we returned from our friends and it was wonderful. I had the remaining for breakfast this morning!   I need to do some grocery shopping soon. I am running out of veggies and that ain't good. Veggies are my saviour during this challenge. I grill tons of them and they are summery and fresh and yummy too!   I just realised that I could go on about tons of things. I could ramble about recipes, clothes, work stuff, the skirts I am making, my 18th birthday party, the day I met my husband, and still, my mind would be set on the blood test results. So I will spare you and go get some work done till the time comes for me to find out...   &nbsp;

       This is my reward for completing my first seven days of my 21 days challenge!   As of this morning I am 89.3 and that means I have lost 1.3 kilos since last Monday. Not bad huh? ;)   I feel good. I feel good because during the weekend I ate a little more than I should, but that was only bigger quantities of the foods I was allowed to eat. I had more grilled chicken, and more grilled fish, and more water melon than I should, but check the list of the things I could have had and didn't:   1. Home made french fries  2. Ice cream  3. Pizza  4. Pitta bread  5. Burgers, sausages, lamp chops, pork chops (all those were sitting right next to my poor chicken breasts in my dad's grill!!!)  6. Beef with mushrooms and caramelised onions in a hot, thick mustard sauce  7. Rice with butter and pine nuts 8. Various sweets, such as creme brulle, panacota, and you don't want to know what else basically cos I don't want to remember them!!!   I must have eaten kilos of grilled zucchinis and peppers and onion and mushrooms to resist those temptation. Along with my yogurt thingy. And lotsa water melon too to resist the sweets. But I did it and I am feeling good and proud of myself.   I walked a little, swam some, but didn't do much exercise. I think all my efforts were to resist the abundance of food in my parents' house. People would be over all day long. Others for breakfast, others for lunch, others for dinner. See my dad stopped working for the summer and has his 5 weeks off, so he was sort of celebrating the start of his summer :)   And I have also to tell you that my mom was a star. And I also have to tell you how she became one..hehehe   See, my mom, like all Greek moms, will make you eat what she&nbsp;has cooked. Cos she puts all her love and affection into cooking just the right thing for you. And she always magically knows what your crave at the time will be. And she always cooks it perfectly.   I had the grilled vegies scheme so I knew she would have made tons from that to please my husband - and she did indeed!- and I was thinking how I was going to resist everything without hurting her feelings.   But when we arrived Saturday afternoon, me on my new jeans and my white tank top, my mom was in the kitchen cooking. So we went inside the house to say hello, and I was calling her "Moooom we're here" when I saw her. She had such a funny face and then she laughed and hugged me and said "Oh you gorgeous carrot look at you in jeans and a tank top again!!!"  (ok...my mom and I call each other veggie names and it is sweet and cute and you are not allowed to laugh at us!!!!)   And for the first time in history, I asked my mom what goodies she was cooking, and she said "none of your concern. I have chicken breasts in the freezer. Go get them, I'll make some for you"!!!!!!!   I laughed so hard and so did she. But she never insisted nor made comments in the table during meals. She never said...oh come on eat this, once won't hurt you, nor she tried to justify my not eating by informing everyone else I am on diet.   It is so great to have my mom as an ally you know. Cos when we were leaving she asked me what are the things I am allowed to eat, and she meant the complete list (herbs too? what kind of herbs huh? oh and olive oil. What is your allowed daily quantity?Are you allowed all kinds of fruit? Milk? Sweeteners? Not even a tsp of honey?). Next Saturday there will be a BIG party in their house for my niece's 4th birthday. My brother and his family moved there for the summer too, and the party will be a big event. And I am sure that my mom won't make me eat stuff next weekend either. And I also know that great cook as she is, she will come up with things for me to eat totally on plan and decadently delicious too!   To end this long post I will have to say that this morning I didn't exercise nor had breakfast cos I had to go and do some blood tests. I have to have my thyroid checked and a couple of fertility hormones too, to see why my cycle has become smaller. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I am hoping all is fine and that my gyno is right and it is just tons of stress and weighloss causing it.   &nbsp;

       Yesterday I was still the good girl that has emerged from somewhere inside me. You know, the eatwellmoveasmuchasyoucanandthensomemore girl. And today I have been mighty good too. Treadmill in the morning - 60 mins, 6.5 km - melon for breakfast, grilled mushrooms and peppers with&nbsp;3 tbsp of cottage (if you want to transform cottage to something more tasty, put it in the blender with your favorite herbs, pepper, a tsp of olive oil, and it becomes a decadent cream) and dinner is planned therefore safe.   But tomorrow I am going to the visit my parents in their summer house for the weekend. And I have to be strong! Cos me mom is such a typical Greek mom who will cook and cook (wonderfully if I may say so myself) and insist and insist that I at least try something.   I was thinking about it and I thought of a scheme hehehe. I am going to call her this evening and out of the blue&nbsp;tell her all about how A (my husband) has lately acquired a passion for grilled veggies. How he loves eating them with yogurt and spices. How happy he is when I make tons of them and have them around so he can munch on them anytime during the day. See me mom is head over heels &nbsp;in love with A. and does everything to please him. I think this way I will have a huge supply of my main food around, and there is always fish in their household, so I will be safe. And so that you won't think bad of me, A does love grilled veggies too!   But what will really be a challenge is the way I feel.   I'm afraid that with all this stress lately at work and other stuff, when I arrive there and see my family in a relaxing atmosphere, and then have my mom try to pamper me with food and stuff, I am afraid I will be tempted-ier than I can sustain.   Truth is that I come every day here and report the previous good day I had. But a greater truth is that every day I think of comfort food constantly. Last night I went home late and then had to get ready to go to that club. And I was eating my food and was thinking about pitta gyros and pasta and icecream with every bite I took of my "healthy" meal.   One can say that I am strong. And driven by my strength I am resisting the temptations and staying faithful to my 21 day challenge.   But I can say something else. (And I know the truth too ;o)   It is not strength that drives me. Not even the burning desire I have so that I will put on my old jeans and a tacked in T-shirt and look great. It is my pertinaciousness that holds me so far. And I don't know if it is good or bad. I'm afraid that pertinaciousness leads to deprivation. (I'm also afraid that pertinaciousness is not spelled correct!) But I will take it for now...Otherwise, I'm afraid I will take up the ice cream offers!

       I had a good day yesterday. A good eating day I mean. Because all the rest of my day was bad.   I was at work till 9 pm. Too many crisis.   I know that holidays are coming. But for some reason August 8 feels like it is years away. And I already am stressing for what it will be expecting me as soon as I return to work on August 30.   This is dangerous you know. If I feel like this now, I am afraid that while on holidays I will have work stuff in the back of my mind.   I feel very tired today. It took all my willpower to get up. I wanted to sleep in so badly. I feel I need a couple of days away from everything. Even away from my friends and family. I dream of two days completely alone, in a beach, reading and swimming and sun bathing. And nothing else.   Tonight I have to go to a club. Everyone from the radio station I'm doing P.R. for arranged a big night out and I am invited. They thought this would be a treat for me, having someone to organise everything and me being the guest for a change. The bad thing is that the club they chose is one my company is doing the P.R. for. And the worst thing is that I don't want to go. I have my last appointment at 8 this evening. They are meeting in midnight there. That means I will get home around 9.30, and will have to cook dinner, and then get dressed and ready to go.   I am not sure I have enough energy to last me till the afternoon.   And I miss my scales too. I miss my daily morning weigh in. But I am resisting.   Treadmill this morning was a drag.   I managed 28 minutes and then almost collapsed in the sofa and felt like crying.   I wonder if it worths working that much. I am not getting richer either. Just crankier and crankier.

       Allo me blog! Feel proud for me because I was so strong last night!   After work I went to see my bestest gf's husband. See, my girlfriend is visiting family in Chicago, and I am sort of looking after her husband. So the deal was I would go by their store near closing time, we would go to their house, where my husband would come after work, I would cook, and we would make all the plans for our 8 days of holidays, so that when Sofia returns depressed (she always returns depressed from Chicago cos she always misses her cousins there) we will have everything ready for her to cheer her up.   Safe it sounded, since I was doing the cooking!   But the men thought otherwise.   They had phoned each other secretly, and had arranged a binge! See, my gf's hubby is really big. Since March I persuaded to see my holistic guru and he is in a very tight program as well. He has lost 30 kilos since then, but still has&nbsp;50 more to loose.&nbsp;Sofia has been watching him closely, but now she is away he decided to have a "day off". And he arranged it with my husband!   So we arrived at their house, and I was getting&nbsp;ready to get in their kitchen, when he told me to relax and have a glass of water and a smoke before cooking. He took my containers (I had cut the veggies I bought during lunch time in the office - tis nice to have a kitchen at work - for the grill,&nbsp;had bought chicken breasts for them, etc) and put them in the fridge.   So we started talking and then the doorbell rung and here comes&nbsp;my husband with his hands full of bags! Let me tell you what he brought:   Chinese fried goodies - philly and shrimp wontons, spring rolls, mince won tons, fried sesame shrimps  Burgers - bacon and egg burger, bacon mushroom melt burger, bbq burger  Potato skins with&nbsp;melted cheddar  3 pitta gyros  A pint of Haagen Dazs Cookies n' Cream  A pint of HD Strawberry Cheesecake  A pint of HD&nbsp;Belgian Chocolate   ALL OF THESE!!!!   And I left him standing with all this in his hands, went to the kitchen, took out their grilling pan, put my veggies on it, grilled them, took my yogurt, added some shredded cucumber and garlic, and returned to them.   I must tell you I was very angry when I entered that kitchen. I was angry with my friend, who is 37 yrs old (I know him since our early teens) and still weighs 155 kilos, probably for the same reasons I am sometimes angry with myself. I was angry with my husband because he eats a mountain of food and stays thin and fit like a supermodel. I was angry because I wanted to eat all these so much. And I was really hungry too, so I was extra cranky!   All the time I was cooking my meal none of them approached the kitchen, and they were mighty quiet too.   So when my food was ready, I took my plate and a fork, and went to the balcony. I peed my pants laughing when I saw them. Each was holding a piece of paper in front of their face with a :o( face on it and SORRY written too.   They were hilarious! Men can be such boys sometimes!   They ate almost everything. I ate my thing being killed by their foods smells all the time. I ate 2 slices of watermelon too. But nothing else. And I rediscovered that water with lotsa icecubes and leaves of spearmint and fresh basil tastes great and makes you feel like having a treat and not just water.   We had an evening full of laughs and teases. They treated me like I was their mean school teacher and I was lecturing them all the time pointing my finger to them. It was an act and we all enjoyed it. Needless to say my anger evaporated.   But we made all the plans for our holidays and we all got excited and we also called Sofia and we all had a blast!   This morning I woke up an hour later than I should have. And because I had stuff to do with banks and other administrative things, I had no time for the treadmill :(   But when I finished my chores I decided to walk to work, so I walked for an hour - about 4 to 5 kms. Athens is gorgeous when it is windy. Warm but not too hot, with clear blue sky. After a few days of strong wind (and its been windy for more than a week!) I get out of the house in the morning and I feel like I have cleaned my sunglasses! Do you know what I mean? Have you ever wore your sunglasses with dust and then cleaned it and realise that everything looks so much cleaner and brighter? This is Athens after windy days...cleaner and brighter!

       I am really very happy! Last March, when I saw this holistic med, my body was in a very bad condition. I was so full of toxins, my liver and&nbsp;kidneys were tired, my skin was dull, you get the picture.  &nbsp;  I went through a very tough detox for almost 3 months. First 3 weeks was a severe toughie. Half a yoghurt and&nbsp;a boiled apple for breakfast,&nbsp;a cup of&nbsp;boiled basmati rice and boiled carrots and broccoli with a little olive oil for lunch and&nbsp;a boiled apple and half a yogurt for dinner. No water 2 hrs before and after meals. No coffee. Horrendous tasting chinese herbs. You get the picture again.  &nbsp;  His approach to weight loss is that in order to loose weight one should first detox their system. Toxins nest in the body fat. They somehow bond fat cells together. When someone is going through fat loss the toxins are released in our body. This is why all "western" diets suggest an increase in our water intake when dieting, so that we flush some of these toxins through out our kidneys.  &nbsp;  So according to him, if I detox my system first, then the fat will loose its "bonds" and come off easier.  &nbsp;  Since March I have lost 13 kilos with his approach. Actually From March to May I have lost 13 kilos. From May to July 19 I have been loosing and gaining the same couple of kilos. So yesterday I went to see him all determined as you might remember to ask him for another detox program.  &nbsp;  So I went to his office, worded my claim, and had him examine me. He is usually very talkative while he examines. But not yesterday. After 20 minutes, he asked: "What did you say you want?" "A new 3 week detox" I said. "Oh...you sure?" he asked... "Yep, give it to me, I don't mind if it is tough like the one in March, I am determined to do it" I said proudly. "Yep, you do sound determined, and this is very good.." he said "...but there is a serious problem with your body now"  &nbsp;  I panicked. What was wrong with me?! He must have seen the panic in my eyes, cos he said in a lighter tone ... "A detox diet requires one basic thing. The existence of toxins in one's body. And your body is mighty clean, besides your lungs, but eating right won't help with this" (I am a smoker to become an ex smoker in September to come hopefully, since we are planning in starting a family, but I'll have my smokes till then!)  &nbsp;  I was stunned! I tell you. I think I was equally happy as if I magically got on the scales and read 69 kg!  &nbsp;  I see him every fortnight. And we have been working a lot together. Acupuncture, herbs, mineral infusions. Our sessions are 60 mins long and they are all an adventure. And the best part is that they all have worked. I feel so much better, more energetic, etc. But to have him say I don't need a detox!!!!  &nbsp;  Anyway...I been bubblier than bubbly!  &nbsp;  So...he told me to put all my determination into loosing, and stop cheating with the excuse of&nbsp;learning to maintain! He can be so blunt at times...and  &nbsp;  What I will eat for these next three weeks:  &nbsp;  Breakfast: 2 pieces of the same fruit, half a yogurt  Lunch: a cup of boiled brown rice, grilled veggies, olive oil  or&nbsp;&nbsp;120 gr lean protein, grilled or boiled veggies, olive oil, apple vinegar  Dinner: when I have rice for lunch dinner will be grilled veggies with baked potato and fruit.&nbsp;When I have protein for lunch dinner will be grilled veggies&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;yogurt or cottage cheese.  &nbsp;  I can have two more pieces of fruit during the day, no other&nbsp;dairy, and I negotiated one coffee too!!! If I'm hungry I can munch on carrots and cucumbers.  &nbsp;  So here...my brand new eating plan.  &nbsp;  It is funny how when I have such a strict routine to follow I get totally dedicated to it. Why can't I be normal???? lol  &nbsp;  This morning I had my husband hide the scales again. I will weigh in next Monday.  &nbsp;  I did 30 minutes on the treadmill...I'm not over the cold that tortured me last weekend (part of the pizzapittagyrosicecream eating was due to me feeling miserable sneezing instead of sunbathing). But I feel determined!  &nbsp;  Here. Fullstop. Too long a post again!

       Here I am, on a Monday morning, all determined. This is what a weekend with bad food&nbsp;will do to you. Pizza (pizza?! I don't even really like pizza!!!), pita gyros, and lotsa ice cream will do this to you! It will make you wake up on Monday, call hubby and ask him where he has hidden the scales, get on, thank god for a 400 gr. gain, and get you all determined for a 21 day challenge. &nbsp; You see, on August 8 we are leaving for holidays. Our trully longed for and very deserved holidays. 22 days in the sun with nothing both of us HAVE to do. 8 days with friends and 14 days just the two of us. Bliss I tell you! &nbsp; So I have decided I need to focus into some serious weigh loss these next three weeks before we leave for holidays. I am going to see my holistic med this evening and ask him for a 3 week detox. He has given me one back in March and I resulted in loosing lotsa kilos in 3 weeks.  &nbsp; I am aiming for 5 kilos&nbsp;&nbsp; this time. I don't think its not feasible. It's less than two kilos a week. Easy peasy (sp?) &nbsp; So this mornign I had 2 peaches for breakfast. And I grilled zucchinis and portobello mushrooms for lunch. And I will have grilled veggies with yogurt for dinner. And after he gives me my diet for the 3 weeks I will post it here and you will have to be bored with daily food and daily&nbsp;gr. lost for the next 21 days. And you can wish me luck, cos usually his detox diets are tougher than tough! &nbsp; I can post my&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;routine for the next 21 days too! &nbsp; I will have to&nbsp;spend at least 40 mins in the treadmill every morning. And do a walk every&nbsp;evening on my way home from work. I will average 10 km a day.  &nbsp; I &nbsp;feel determined. I think I have had enough fun lately with maintaining mainly. Having a good week and then have it ruined. The good thing is that I have maintained. So now I learned how to do this, perhaps it is time for some loosing, don't you think?  &nbsp; Anyone else up for a good 21 days of loosing?

       Today I wear a white tank top. And today it is a normal Wednesday. I mean, I came to the office this morning, had one appointment at noon, have spent my lunch break with my assistant gossiping over girly magazines, then I have my therapy session at 8 pm, and since my husband is not coming home tonight due to a work thing, I will meet my two best male friends and go out for dinner with them.  See? A normal Wednesday as I said. Not a Wednesday I have off work, lingering all day at home, tending to my plants, watching movies, etc.  It is a normal Wednesday and I wear a white tank top! In public! Outside from home!   And guess what!  People were not pointing at me in the street screaming "Oh my god look at her arms!!!"  N., my assistant, said to me: I don't understand why I have never saw you on a tank top before. You look like a teenager on it!  I did not think she is trying to sneak her way into a higher paycheck when she said this.  You think Im crazy for saying all this, don't you? You see, I have never wore a tank top before, but in the safety of my house. Never ever in public. Never ever without a jacket. Never ever without being thin.  See, my arms are a big issue for me. I have always hated them. They are not nice and toned. They have stretch marks. They are big.   But the last days I spend some time with them. I think of them. I talk to them. I spend more time moisturising them. To give you an idea of how far I have gone, I admired their tan this morning. And it was then that I thought of something:  The parts of my body that need the most work, are the parts of my body I used to hate. Arms fall under this category.  But hating them, neglecting them, denying them even will never solve their problem. As a matter of fact I was thinking that the more I deny them the more of a problem they become. So I decided to acknowledge their existence and show them to the world.   So spending my day on a tank top so far has taught me this: I am the worst, more strict judge for myself. Perhaps I should loosen up a little and treat myself like I treat other people.   And oh! Oh please, do not worry. I will not wear a mini skirt next!

       You see, it is that simple. (Actually it will be that simple if "rings" is the right english to use...do you call the small parts a chain consists of rings?!?)  If I wake up in the morning, and do my 40 mins in the treadmill, I am hungry afterwards, so eating breakfast is not something I HAVE to do, but something I enjoy.  If I eat my breakfast, then I get in a oh so healthy mood, therefore I prepare a healthy lunch to take with me to work.  If i eat a healthy lunch at work, I feel great, and I get all creative in my mind, usually coming up with a new combination of healthy ingredients that will find their way to my cooking pot for dinner.  If I eat a good and healthy dinner, I feel content but not full or sick, so our evening is always better.  If I do my 40 mins in the treadmill in the morning, by 11.30 I am ready to go to bed.  If I sleep before midnight, I am all refreshed in the morning, and doing my 40 mins in the treadmill seems like a piece of cake, therefore I do 20 mins more.   If I do 20 mins more of exercise in the morning, I am a lot more hyper during the day, and a lot more focused, since exercising looses my tension and stress from all the crisis I have at work, therefore I have a better working day. Plus I get tired earlier in the evening, and we go to bed at 11, which gives me extra time for cuddles and sleep.  If I have a good working day, I have a far better evening at home because I do not have crisis occupy my mind *wink*  If I have a great mood in the evening, that means I am not bored or stressed therefore my mind doesnt drift away to chocolate icecream.  If I dont think of chocolate icecream I dont eat chocolate icecream.  If I dont eat chocolate icecream, I do not wake up full of guilt in the morning, therefore my 60 mins in the treadmill is something I am so looking forward to.  It's so damn simple. Just keep all the rings together. You can't fail with this trick!  P.S. I have been that good the last 6 days! And I had my husband hide the scales too! I will weigh in on August 6, last working Friday before H O L I D A Y S ! ! !

       ...to all. I am here to report that yesterday and the day before had been two very good days eating wise. Both nights I wanted chocolate icecream (my husband had gotten some for himself) and both nights I ate water melon instead. I had fruits in the blender for breakfast and big fruitsalads for lunch. And for dinner on Wednesday I had a salad with boiled potatoes, beetroots, garlic, parsley, basil, and fresh oreganon. Yesterday dinner consisted of ...oh...I can give ya the recipe cos it was good!  K...boil big chuncks of beef when they are almost done, add zucchinis, and lotsa peppers, red, green, yellow, and onions. Add some tomato juice and let it simmer till the sauce is thick. Very tasty and with no added fat (oil or butter). So this has been my food for the last 2 days.  No treadmill still. My back is bad this time. It usually hurts a little when I get my period, but this time has been really bad.  I managed a walk yesterday for an hour though on my way home from work. It was hot but very windy so I decided to take the metro instead of taxi and walk the remaining distance to our home, about 6 km.  I don't feel great, I don't feel like I am on top of my weight loss all over again, not I feel so super extra motivated again. But I smile to myself every day I wake up for the day before. It is a start I think.  My gyno asked me to run some blood tests to check my thyroid. I had it checked last year and it was ok, but the last few months my cyrcle is getting smaller. I had a 27 - 28 cyrcle and now it is 24 to 25. I am panicking although he tells me not to worry. I am so afraid something will go wrong and I won't be able to have children.  Oh I hate this feeling, sort of out of breath when I think of this...

       It is 11 in the morning and I am still at home, sipping coffee with lotsa icecubes too! I woke up at 10.15. I slept at 11 last night. I had such a great sleep. I am not feeling on top of the world, but I feel human again!  I have spent the last 40 minutes reading journals and blogs. And I have to thank you all ladies (and gent!). Thank you Dietgirl, thank you Kimba, thank you Yvonne, thank you Lynn, thank you Amanda, thank you Denise, thank you Angel, thank you Jo, thank you Metamorpheus, thank you Daze, thank you Lynne, thank you thank you!  Part of me is still in a low state. I had a marathon in therapy last weekend. I have not talked about it yet. And I will not talk about it now either, since I don't have the time. It is either writting about it all, or getting in the treadmill, making lunch, showering and getting to work. I took this morning off and I have to be there at 1 for my first appointment. I prefer to get back to the treadmill.  I will tell you what a marathon is. I take private sessions in therapy. But every three months we do a marathon. This is a group of 10 people and 2 therapists. We meet at 10 am and work till 8 in the evening on Saturday and Sunday. It is very intense work and utterly revealing all the time. We always have a topic. This weekend it was all about The Body. I promise to tell you all about it soon.  Today I feel I need to work towards getting back. And I feel like I can try.   I stayed with my sadness long enough and realised it. It;s tricky you know. When you feel its almost all worked out and resolved, sneaky bastards reappear. The point is though, that the sneaky bastards expect to find a good easy vicitm to work their tricks at. Well guess what! I aint this person anymore!  Cheers for a great day to begin (even at this late hour :)

       I do not feel well. If I am to be precise, I feel confused, angry, tired, and somehow disappointed.   I am using my brain too much again. And my body always looses the battle you know.  I am rationalising too much. I am giving myself too many excuses. I work out and I feel I'm doing the right thing. I eat so so and feel I am doing something. But I weigh 90 kilos and doing something that leads to maintaining is not good anymore.  And I think a lot. I think of WW and I realise that if I go there, it will only be for the weigh in. Cos the leaders here in Athens, at least the ones I have come across, are nothing like the motivational descriptions I have read online. And I can't spare the money for just the weigh in. Which makes me think that I don't just need discipline. I need someone to whom I have to be good. And that makes me angry.  Because being good to myself should be enough you know.  I know I have my period and I know my feelings are intensified cos of this. I also know I had my period early again and this makes me worry about my body. And perhaps this is the reason I am mildly overeacting.   But the bottomline is that I am having no breakfast. I have a healthy lunch. And I  have a not so healthy dinner, or equally bad, too much of a healthy dinner.  Perhaps I need some rest too. Because I have been working way too much again, and sleeping way too little with the footy celebrations and the wedding and christening the last 15 days.   I definitely need to clear my head.

       Have you heard??? Oh you must have!!! The outsiders won the euro cup!!! Oh you cannot imagine the excitement in Athens!!! You cannot imagine the excitement in Greece!!! My office is a couple of kilometers away from the Panathenian Stadium, where in 2 hours the champs will be lifting the cup for us all, and it is packed already!!!!  Right. I probably wrote this about an hour ago...or maybe more! But an evil phone call got me working again.  And now I got to go see the team lift the cup!!!!  I'm so overly excited!!!!

       Do you guys ever read Susan Miller’s site? The www.astrologyzone.com? Well, when I feel like toying with astrology, this is the one and only site I visit. She has proven to be accurate for lill’ aquarius like meself and she always have a very sweet way of writing.  Truth is I have slept 4 hours only last night. Or this morning I should say to be precise. Like hundreds of thousands Greeks last midnight, my husband and I joined the crowd and went downtown to celebrate Greece being in the final of Euro 2004. We were back home at 6 am and I slept till 10 this morning. I woke up super tired and only managed 13 minutes in the treadmill before collapsing.  But like yesterday, I feel a tad bloated. Surely it is one week before my period is due. And perhaps this can be the reason for my moodiness, but it definitely is not the reason for my bloatedeness (does this word exists?). When I was doing this strict thing the holistic med gave to me back in March and April and middle of May, all 3 periods I had during these months did not make me bloated. My body did not retain water during that time. I am convinced that we women retain water during our periods when we eat crap. And by crap I do not mean fattening things only. I also mean bad quality foods, full of chemicals and stuff.  Anyway, I have resulted I am bloated because exercise only is not enough. And because lately I eat bad quality foods. And my body is retaining water to cope with the crap.   So to cheer myself up this morning when I got to work – and give some time to my brain to wake up so I could actually function – I made a coffee and went to check my monthly forecast in Susan’s. She said that this full moon tonight is bad bad bad! So I decided I am bloated because of the Moon! Since it makes us feel worn out and miserable. BUT she also said:  “This month you have an ideal chart for losing weight, for Saturn will give you a craving for routine, as well as a certain level of self-discipline that will help you achieve impressive results. “   Oh how I need some discipline!!! I don’t seem to find it though. I thought that if I worked my arse off for an hour in the treadmill in the morning, I would not want to destroy all this effort by having ice cream in the evening. Truth is that in the beginning it worked exactly like I had imagined. But it evolved to being an excuse for not eating right. The “I’ll work an extra fifteen minute and burn this” scheme doesn’t work anymore. I got on the scales this morning and have gained 500 grms again. Seem to be loosing and gaining the same couple of kilos for the whole of June.  I am thinking of WW. The terror of Ms. Barbara, the weigh in lady could be something that would make me be good. I feel if I manage to be good for a week, then I will be good for a month. And I mean Good GOOD not semigood like I am now.  But then, WW???  Oh I am so bad with decisions! I think now I must return to work. Or else I’ll never leave here!

       Silly I know. But last time Greece played in Euro I posted before watching the game and this is what I am going to do now too!  It will be a short post though because I am so busy at work this week that I barely have time to breath!  I have not eaten very well lately. Monday was our wedding anniversary and we had our two best friends over. I went crazy when I got home and decided to really cook. First, main, salads, deserts! Yeap...plural. I made 3 different kinds of deserts, a genuine Jamie Oliver's chocolate tiramisu, a kinda light thing with jello, fruits and yogurt, and a classic greek choco thingy with biscuits, butter (lotsa butter), eggs, cocoa, cognac, sugar. Veeeeeeeeeery decadent I promise you. Take 400 grms of butter, leave them in room temp, them mix it with 200 grms of cocoa, 3 eggs, sugar, cognac, and break a whole box of petit beurre biscuits in small pieces, put it in the mixture , put the whole thing in alluminum foil, then in the freeze and here! D I S A S T E R !!!! Needless to say noone ate the jello - yogurt thingy! So I ate like a pig on Monday (we ALL ate like pigs!!!) and then Tuesday I had nothing all day but coffees and then for dinner I had a piece of that tiramisu. Yesterday I had a salad for lunch and a sald for dinner but there was too much feta cheese and olive oil involved.   Today has been better so far, but with the footy tonight...  I can't seem to be able to eat breakfast after excersise. I just don't want anything but water!  Perhaps I am not eating well because I am so mad busy with work and the preparations for my nephew's christening this saturday that I have not done any food shopping for me. We just eat what is still in the freeze and I just buy a few fruits and veggies on my way back from work.    At least I work out more and more. I do 35 to 50 mins in the morning and 25 to 35 mins early in the evening. So I have not shown a gain, but this is not good. I have lost so little during June.   I need to concentrate and decide if I go on my own or join WW for a month to boost things up. We will be leaving for our summer holidays in August 6 and will be back on the 29, so if I really make the effort I can loose 4 to 6 kilos by then.  Why I am not determined?  Life is so busy and then so fun and I am falling of the wagon me thinks.  (Can you tell Im typing so super fast before I got to go and still want to post? I'm sure this will be full of typos!!!)  Cheers for now!!! Happy July to all!!! Athens is getting hotter and hotter :)

       It is almost time to go!!!! Stressed as hell since I still haven't bought my holiday books and I have no list for them either!!! So few things and I'm gone!!!  Timezones have got the best of me. I got some of your emails too late for returning them and ask for your addies. BUT I will get the postcards, write them and get your addresses when I'm back and post them. Deal?!  I weighed in this morning and I have lost 600 grams since last Monday. This means I lost 3,4 kilos in my 21 days challenge. I am pleased :o) The challenge now is to keep it off during this 21 days of holidays!!!!  And now I got to go. Take care all, enjoy your time and cheer for Athens 2004 for me please ;o)  *Hugs*

       or else...why does the last day before holidays have to be hell-in-the-office????  I have been here since 8 am and the only reason I came sooooooo early is thinking that I'd be done by noon and then go finish with holidays preps. I still haven't bought my books, haven't packed, haven't had breakfast or lunch, and its friggin 16.40!!!!!  I think I must have had this window open for at least a couple of hours!  So this morning I was thinking that when I will come back from holidays I will have so much catching up to do with your blogs and progress. It got me all excited! I will have something to look forward to.  I will have to go back to work now hoping I will finish before the bookstores close!!!!  The postcard offer still stands. Tomorrow we are leaving in the afternoon, so surely I will have my morning coffee catching up on blogosphere! Email me with your address if you want :o)  Have fun these three weeks to come, enjoy life, yourselves, and the sun!

       Ladies, you are amazing!  Thank you all for your keeping me more thankful today too! Your suggestions were wonderful and ....oops...I got lots to say so I better start now huh? (beware of yet another long post)  So, with your valuable contribution, I have come up with a flexible plan. Also, last night, after Tania's valuable advice, and since I am sort of the all-or-nothing type, we sat down with my husband and we went through all the things we like to have while on holidays, and I have a list of naughty delights, which I am going to eat with a pattern. But better go ahead and list 'em all.  So...    Dinner will be our fancy meal (thank you DG :)  I will have twice spaghetti with lobster (this is typical greek island food, and I am usually having it every other night...lol) so once a week will keep me satisfied I hope  I will have ice cream once a week too, and when I have it, dinner will not contain alcohol  Breakfast will be yogurt with fruits and a tsp of honey...this is what I always have during holidays, and the little bit of honey Im putting is not too much. After all I'm Greek and have been raised to beleive that a tbs of honey a day keeps the doctor away ;o)  For lunch, since we go to the beach around noon and stay till 7-8 in the evening, will be fruits, coffees, water, and raw vegetables like cherry toms, and cucumbers. After all I can't eat much when I'm boiling in the sun ;o)  For every glass of alcohol I am going to do 100 snips in the water. (Now I dunno if snips is the right word. What I mean is when you are in the deep water and your feet have at least a couple of meters distance from the bottom, and you sort of put one foot in front of the other, like walking? Same kind of exercise when you lie down and you lift one foot after the other? Urrrghh this is frustrating!!! I hope you understand!)  On our way back to our cottage A. will leave me 4 km before there and I will walk the remaining distance  Lotsa sex will be involved, I promise you  I also put my jeans in the washer today, in hot water too, so they shrink and I will try them on every 4 days, and see if there is change. I never wear jeans during holidays, I am more on thinner and softer fabrics in the isalnds, so they will maintain their freshly washed snuginess. (I came up with this after Linda's advice :)  And I will not stress too much! Thanks Lee :0)   And I promise...after holidays I will look for a Body Pump class. I have JUST been thoroughly persuaded ;o)  This is all for now. Not too long after all! But I have tons of work to do before I leave and I only have today and tomorrow!!!  Cheers for now, tomorrow will be the last post before holidays!!!! Oh...and!!! I am crazy about sending post cards from the islands. So if you want one, leave me a comment and I'll make sure to get your addy!

       The mornings have become blissful. My husband is not working and we wake up together. After the cuddles, I go to my study, and turn on the puter to start reading on the blogs, while he is making me coffee, which he brings in, leaves it on my desk, and quietly disappears, till I properly wake up and am sociable and fun to talk to. Cos I'm a loner in the mornings, and need my time alone.  So after having my coffee and daily reads today, I turned the puter off, and went to the living room to see him. I thanked him for being so nice and leaving me alone to do my morning routine without complaining for not having breakfast with him, etc. I told him how thankful I am to have someone take care of me the way he does.  He looked at me very seriously. For about a minute he was silent. He then said "I am thankful too you know". I rushed to say something but he stopped me. He said "I am thankful for the way  you  take care of yourself " I was stunned! Because for a second there I had actual images of me, of us, of him. Images of before, and images of now. And I really felt thankful. So I decided to list some things that were and not are anymore. And some things that weren't and now are:   Things that used to be   * I weighed 130 kilos * I woke up in the morning sick from the food I had the last day * I detested what I was seeing in the mirror * I was uncomfortable all the time * I had back pains and swollen foot all the time * I was sarcastic to every person saying anything sweet or nice to me * I was angry from the time I woke up to the time I slept * I was not brushing my teeth at night * I was feeling horrible in the mornings when I was showering and had to actually touch my body * I thought I was going to eat myself to my death some day. For minutes before I drifted to sleep I used to beg God to let me live and not die in my sleep cos of the amounts of food in my stomach. * I always felt that my family and friends loved me cos they had to, since they were family and old friends, and not cos I deserved it, since, after all, I looked and was horrible * I was smoking pot so that I would have an excuse for my late night binges being caused my the munchies and not by my humendous appetite * I was distant to my partner no matter whatever effort he put on approaching me * I was dreading meeting a potential customer because I was certain I wouldn't get the account due to the way I looked * I always thought that no matter how much weight I loose I will always be fat, since loosing 60 kilos needed a good number of years of hard work, and I thought I was not capable of sticking to a diet. * I was discouraged to try since I had gained and lost big amounts of weigh in the past to gain it all back plus more.   Things that actually are now :  * I have worked hard in many different ways since 2001 and have accomplished a loss of 42 kilos * I shower twice a day so that I can put more body lotion on and feel myself * I love going shopping * I take time in getting ready and like spending time in front of the mirror! * My family and friends are no more afraid to talk to me * I wake up in the morning all happy for the new day and all ready for my exercise * Food is a pleasurable fuel and not my death anymore * I feel I can conquer the world some days * I have made 3 new customers in the last month * I actually dream about the future * I brush and floss my teeth before bed * I am having an affair with my husband * I am confident that I will loose the remaining 18 kilos * I am hopeful I will keep it off for good * I feel grumpy if I don't exercise for a couple of days in a row * I am thankful for the gift of life  Now I wrote all this down, I suddenly had a feeling of insecurity. I do not want you to feel that I am smug or egoistical or too fond of myself.  I just want to put this down for my own good. Because putting it down makes me remember and appreciate. Putting it down makes me accountable. Putting it down makes me to never want to go back. Putting it down proves that it is doable. And I want to tell you all, that if I can do it, then anyone can.  I am nervous about leaving for holidays. This is also one reason for putting my list down. Holidays mean no routine. No routine means challenges.  My husband eats a lot and adores a good meal with a good wine. And he is of the lucky kind to eat for four and maintain a six pack. Surely he works out a lot. He is the very energetic type and moves all the time. Last night he asked me hesitantly. "Honey, when we go to the island, will you still eat that little?" I laughed because I knew what he really wanted to ask: "Honey, when we go to the island, will we enjoy a meal a day together or will I go on feeling bad for eating what I eat while you only have salad?"  I know that lately it is a little frustrating for him. Now he isnt working I know he is having fast food lunches, pasta, pizza, etc. all the things that are sort of forbidden in our household. And he is the kind of person who enjoys a good meal with company. He loves commenting on the taste and stuff.  And the truth is I am nervous because I enjoy a good restaurant a lot when I am in holidays. And I am afraid to eat "normal" because I either binge or am dieting. The normal inbetween is still something of an almost unfamiliar territory. Surely, the last couple of months I was loosing and gaining the same couple of kilos and considered myself maintaining, but yet, I was at home, I had the treadmill, and most of all the scales to tell me every day how I was doing.  And surely the scales are hidden and get out once a week now, but they are handy if needed.  How do I do when on holidays? Weighin in some "foreign" scales might show a loss or gain that aint real. How do I control myself without being too picky and without depriving my partner from his beloved dinners in nice restaurants during holidays?  I have to come up with a plan. A flexible one. And I have to stop typing too. Because this post resembles a novel in length again!

       Athens is hot! Athens is extremely hot! And I don't mean hot as in having high temperatures! I mean hot as in having too many Olympic Bodies walking down the streets, shopping, drinking something (high nutritional I assume) in the sunshine.  I have to admit that hosting the Olympics was not my dream. I was not overly excited about it. I assume I belong to this group of people that think more about what will happen next. I worry about the high maintenance costs, the possible rise in unemployment, and the likes. As a greek too, I am not too happy about the way the Olympics have deteriorated the last decades. And by that I mean that it is all about money. Sponsorships, doping, athletes poisoning their bodies with all kinds of substances that make them run faster, and jump higher and fight harder. It is not an ideal as it used to be. It is not noble anymore. It is plain competitive.  I have to admit however that the enthusiasm is contagious! And I feel it in the air. Athens is beautiful. Colourful banners are everywhere. Fuchsia, turquoise, yellow and orange banners with the Athens 2004 sign are hanging from the light pillars in all main streets. Flowers are blooming in pots and parks and street sides. The weather is gorgeous and for the first time in years it is pleasantly (around 30 C) and not boilingly (around 40 C) warm. There is a cool breeze. The brand new tram is cruising the streets. The new train is doing its rounds. More and more people wear t-shirts and caps with the Olympic colours and signs. Tourists are eveywhere. And please oh please don't forget the Olympic Bodies!!! Athletes that smile to you when they realise you been staring. And you smile back and try to restrain winking too!  But then, looking at someone because they are gorgeous, and smiling back and all, could be considered a form of flirting. You know, not flirting with a cause, but just flirting for fun. Actually, to be more precise, feeling confident to look at someone else, feeling confident at smiling back at them, feeling all feminine and that. This is what is happening to me lately. I feel feminine. I take so much time picking my undies, clothes, shoes. My husband told me yesterday that I look so good all the time that he could, if he wanted, think I have a boyfriend! He made me laugh so much when he said that! But the truth is that I have started to love my body and feel good in it. Please, do not make the mistake and think I am looking half as good as I feel. I still have the entire package: flabbiness, cellulite, fat arms, fat thighs. After all, almost 88 kilos in my 1.67 frame is a lot. But I have discovered more things too! Nice collar bones are back in town mates! Round shoulders have come back! When I look down I can now see my panties! My tummy and stomach are flattening! My waist is 91 cm. It used to be 112!  And all this is not a result of just hard work. All this is not a result of just eating right and exercising. It is also a result of beginning to love my body. Touching it. Getting in contact with it. Remember the tank top post? Daze commented I was so funny talking to my fat arms and that. It was funny. But it was fun too. My therapist challenged me to do it. He said that the parts in our bodies that we detest the most, and consequently neglect, and don't touch, and resent them, are the same parts that block the right flow of energy in our bodies. And they tend to remain miserable.  I challenge you all! Feel your worst parts. Talk to them. Caress them. Make friends with them. I promise you. All they need is some sweet talk. I promise you they will react to your paying more attention to them. And their reaction will astonish you!  Now you can all go back to your days thinking I am completely mad. Thinking that loosing weight has loosen some screws in my brain and I am totally insane. Ah come on. You might be right. But you will not find out unless you try.  Come on...talk to your bodies the way you would talk to a beloved friend. As in every course of corrective action, one cannot move forward too much unless one forgives and makes peace. Forgive your thighs for storing the chocolate. Make peace with your bellies for storing the pasta. I am trying to do this. Some times I suceed. Others I struggle. Help me do it by doing it to. And think of me of a greekmadwoman. I prolly am in a way. But I promise you. I see it working on me. It will work on you too!  Cheers from madland for now *wink*

       August is finally here! The long expected holiday month arrived with a nice cool breeze and the anticipation of holidays in its highest ever! I literally cannot wait for this week to pass and Saturday to arrive. And then I will be gone from August 7 to August 29...  BLISS!!!!     August found me 1.5 kilos lighter. Isn't it nice? I now weigh 87.8 which is almost 11kilos less than last August, and this is good!  The weekend was challenging and I escaped again with the same weekend trick. Just eat a little more of the allowed stuff. And way too much water melon!  Saturday, on my niece's birthday party, my mom made me some kind of dessert. It was nice if you like jello - type of thingies. She mixed fruit juices from very ripe fresh peaches with zelatin and mixed all this with yogurt and vanilla essence and had it frozen. Nice, but I am on for more chocolaty than fruity things. But it kept me satisfied while everyone else was eating cake and icecream.  I was tempted more than once yesteday. My mom gave me tons of leftovers for my husband. Meat pie, cheese pie, a gorgeous pie she makes with peices of meat, tomatoes, feta and pees, home made pizza, sausage rolls, you name it, it was in the container!  Yesterday, early afternoon, we were watching a DVD with my husband after the beach, and I told him that I could hear all these things calling my name from the refrigerator. He laughed and said that I have been extremely good for 14 days and that perhaps I could have a little piece of something. So I went to the fridge, opened it, took a piece of meat pie, had a bite, then spit it out and then threw away the remaining piece. What went to my mind at that time was this blog, and the challenge. I felt I would feel so bad reporting that I broke my good program that I actually spitted the piece out! (sorry for being so gross with the description!)  This made me realise something. All my life, in all the several dietings I went through, I had my weekly weigh in somewhere. This was WW, or a nutritionist - dietologist. My holistic med doesnt have a scale. He let's me do the work and weigh in and he never mentions weight since for him other things are way more important. And when I am dieting all by myself, I can cheat a little, or change weigh in days, etc. But ever since I started this blog, I feel accountable to you all and that keeps me in track.  So thank you all for making me feel this way and for being so very helpful to me through this quest.  Also, I figured out a way to reply to comments! I will leave a comment to your comment on my comments...simple huh?  That's all for today. Have a great August!
