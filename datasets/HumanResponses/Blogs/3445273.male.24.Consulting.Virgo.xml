       hey diary ...  today did nothing much in the office .. still waiting for ma visa to go uk .. hmm the news that i heard three weeks ago about me being booked for a job in uk (leeds to be precise) has gone from on cloud nine to shit might not be going ... the september 11 really has gave a lot of effects to ma working life .. been rejected a working visa to new york just because i got a 'bin' in the middle of ma name ... oh yeah and ppl who did chemical engineering considered to be a threat .. all these .. just too much .. i wish that those world trade centers are still standing over there ... well so much for ma hopes .. enough bout that ...  so what else should i do? wanna go for a break like i did in my previous years ... too bad not enough vacation left in my account .. damn ... plus don't think have that much green in ma bank account at the moment .. wondering where has all those per diems from saudi gone too ..   oh yeah from now on will try to talk about ma travelling experiences to you guys .. i just love travelling especially to those beaches ... just admiring the beauty of nature ... wished that there are still mermaids around .. hmm me and ma wish again ..   ok guys need to write another post bout ma experience now .. signing off with bored face today ... adios

       as promised earlier gonna share with you guys ma experiences over there in saudi .. hmm where should i start with .. oh yeah how in the world did i get thrown over there? one single explanation .. work! yeap thats the magic word. was there for 9 whole months working ma ass off due to the obligation given to me to be carried out .. hahaha ... let me just cut it short ok .. the weather is like so hot during summer which is between july till september but starts to get a bit cold towards december - cold meaning the temperature around 24 to 28 degree celcius which is not bad at all compared to during summer where it can go up to 40!!! people are very rude over there. there would not be a single moment on the road where you would not hear a car being honked or doing the honking ... for car lovers saudi should be the place to be as you can see all the latest model driven recklessly by those oil sheikh having tonnes of money to burn ... for the beach and diving lover you would be amazed on how beautiful the red sea can offer you .. the underwater cave is just an extraordinary view that i can't just explain ... food? excellent! if you love meat saudi is the place .. seafood lover stay away from the country ...   in summary its better to remember all those nice memories than you rather than the bad ones which is what i'm doing now... just remember that without those bad memories you will never get the sweet ones ..   again signing off from my dare with a smily and sleepy face!

       here goes nothing .. today i took the first step of 'sharing' what goes around in my life to all who like to share it with me .. feels just like taking the first step when i was a baby .. wonder? maybe .. miracle? i guess so ..  what shall i blog about today? ok .. it is still early in the morning .. afternoon if i might say ... things in the office is quite slow .. nothing much to do .. just got back from the middle east .. saudi to be exact ... will tell you about the saudi experience in the next blog ...   now i'm down with terrible and annoying flu ... running nose oh man .. really really annoying especially when you're suppose to see someone 'important'...   better stop here before ma nose gets jealous with me ... giving all the intentions to this new toy of mine (blogger it is) instead of wiping my nose with some cheap tissues .. hmm signing off with a smile on my first step
