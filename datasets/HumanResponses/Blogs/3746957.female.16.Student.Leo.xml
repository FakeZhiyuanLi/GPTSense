      it is one of those days again that i'll wake up in the morning and feel like i'm all alone  there used to be people here noises,presences but now, its just me and the cold breeze  it is one of those nights again that i'll sit by the window  and stare at the stary sky and keep wondering  is this real? or is this just meant to hurt me?  looking at the stars counting it knowing that its there but i cant feel it is it true then? that you are here?  it is one of those moments again that i have to say good bye but we'll meet again one day  so from now until that day we would still be friends...forever!

      Even kittens have mothers to love to nurture  and to care  Even the moon have the clouds to share their laughter  and their tears with  Even the trees have the flowers to talk with to grow with and to play with...  What about me? what am i?  A 16 year old girl  who lives in a small town with lots of friends and the best grandma but...where's my family...  Education,career and death took them away and left me behind as an useless clay..

      Thou she looks small but she's actually HUGE Thou she seems weak but she's very strong Thou she's my leader but she's a cool gal Thou she scares me at time but i still love her...  Coz she's here when i'm drain Pulls me up when i drop She accepts me for who i am And she still loves me thou i'm a brat...  My laugh is her laugh My smile is her smile My tears are thou its hers And my burdens..she lifts them up  Angela... is my inspiration My love And my care Thanks for being there with me Thru thick and thin And i'm sorry for causing you so much pain Now until forever You'll be my...inspiration
