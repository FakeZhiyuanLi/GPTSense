        Sunday  ...   a day to take    J  a  h   (  my 14 ft boat .. '67   she was born )  out to Hermit Island..la-la..off we go..Hermit Island..what a place...MILLIONS of Hermit Crabs living in so many different   colored   shells..of all shapes and sizes ...itty-bitty  ones in shells so small, you couldn't imagine something living in there..but pick it up..hold it still&nbsp;and the smallest tiny trusting legs come out..eyes so small you can't see...but you can   feel him seeing you....then they big daddy&nbsp;Hermit Crabs as large as grapefruits!   &nbsp;   Im a lucky lady..Waters of all kind surround my life..two very large winding Rivers and the Ocean...one River met the other..then the two decided to head towards the Ocean..so one could stay inland and take care of the animals..and the other run along the Coast..supporting Wildlife that prefered Beach and River front property...but along came humans..slicing and dicing and pulverizing&nbsp;our Planet to meet their needs..so the rivers had to run out into the Oceans..Inlets they call them .. for progress..pfffft..     &nbsp;   The day on Hermit Island was as lovely as always....when the tide is low..as it was..lil sandbars twist through it..letting you wade amoungst blue crabs...an oocasional sting ray swims by and waves at you with his tail...    As you look towards the Indian River, which is the one forced to go out that nasty inlet with the hundreds of stinkies going in and out...you see the Dolphins coming into the River for feeding time...    they come so close you can talk to them......they always have such lovely stories to share...     &nbsp;   At one point the Island was a place for our homeless to live...lot of 'homeless' in my area have boats...old very tired girls..but they float..and at one point used to live on Hermit Island....but the  Lawman  ran them away...they have run them away from every place they try to live....     &nbsp;   Suddenly..The Clouds Came...they do that every day here this time of year....Mother had decided it was time to cleanse...a lil earlier then expected...lucky I was someone that had once lived there had left part of his/her&nbsp; home..half a tent....had to make shelter with it in the Mangrove Roots....using rocks to hold down the 'house part'..the Winds got big...lightening very large...the Crabs joined me....and a few bugs..when She gave a break...run to boat and head for land....     &nbsp;   Today I dont want to talk about....     &nbsp;

       the Sun has graced me again....Her warmth is like my Heaven.     3 years ago..My world changed forever ...  I was sucked into a horrifying system...At the hands of human beings who were to old to drive....Yes to old. One decided he needed to run a 4 way stop sign and run into the front of my car...He going 65 +..Me turning the corner at around 4mph...    2 months later...Rear-ended. Much the same as in the speed ...She was talking on her cell phone...ahh the cell phone...Goes   so   well with driving-like eating and doing paperwork.     &nbsp;   Both of the people were fully insured by one of our nations top insurance companies...State Farm....I, as a single parent of 4..Had substandered insurance...But had worked very, very hard..Overcoming tribulations in my life...That make most flinch...Maybe someday I can tell that story here...    I owned my own business and was three weeks away from becoming totally licensed and had an investor to diversify my business.....Wham...That all over....ahh yes I can hear you...Did you sue??'    but of course...Isn't this what one does when they have their life taken away? ( my injuries are long to list- but I am now disabled) I thought that there was something called Justice( I now know the color of Justice is green , as was I in the ways of the big ugly scam)..Attorneys who actually fought for your rights....So I ended up firing three sets..( all who slapped lovely liens on my cases)...I ended up with nothing...A few thousand dollars..No car..And what was once a very active life..Gone. Prior to..I surfed...rock climbed ..white water rafted....and could do things like sit on&nbsp;the floor and read a book to my children..play football with my sons...all gone.    All while the two people who hit me...both very well off..sip tea on their water front properties.    Never a thought of the family they destroyed.    I had no medical insurance at the time....so I never received proper medical care...after being approved for disablity ( as if i can raise 4 children on 500 bucks a months...) I was given the pleasure of government issued insurance...Medicade....dont get me wrong..a wonderful program for children in our counrty....( what am I saying..health care should be free....but thats another post )...they do next to nothing for adults.    It has taken me&nbsp;a year of hypno therpay just to accept Im hurt and that I must go on....I spent those years curled in a hole in my bed.....not even knowing the day or caring. ( thank Mother Earth I had a loving boyfriend by mine and my childrens side the while time and to this day )    I had developed social anxiety disorder so bad...I couldn't face even my own friends....going outside of the house was like setting into a nightmare....    I am now..celebrating my 19th day out of bed...still dealing with intense pain...even though Im on more opiates then all of the mid eastern world...    I must stop now.....talking about it starts pulling me back...but talking about it ...is what I must do..   .....   what I must do now is go outside and&nbsp;look around at the&nbsp;Skies and the Warmth...  &nbsp;  Peace....

        A very interesting day, indeed. My friend led me here. I think I shall enjoy my time and hopefully...so shall you. I've no clue where I shall begin or what I shall do...never really have...      A storms moving in...I can smell it through the window..and my Sun has gone into the Clouds...a rumble I hear...they come off of the Mighty Ocean every day here..I feel She's trying to rinse away the dirt of the day..      Snorkled today....not far from my home is a beautiful creation of Mother..a local Beach..titled Bathtub Beach..named so because a large Living Coral Reef extends outward from the Beach and paralell to the shore...200 yards or so..creating a nautral tidalpool...the water in the tub is very warm...the children love it..their laughter always brings a smile to my face...gently I stepped over the Reef...low tide She extends some three feet above the water....and down into cold water..waist deep..the change in temprature always feels cleansing....      Mask and snorkel in place I went to my most favorite spot, deep inbetween low lying coral , covered in marine life      ...a thousand silver fish live there..all the size of a babies fists..they don't seem to mind when I come to visit..swim slowly in.and float there...they swim around you as if your a guest...      Must go for now...      Clouds coming  &nbsp;

       Its been far to long since I  came  to my room . I got swallowed by a hole.  Not a pleasent hole . Who looks harder for the  pretty  and good then one such as I who drowned in sadness and pain for so long. Yea, damn right you gotta look  hard . Even peeking through cracks. SHIT AINT EASY!..."  hello how are you have a nice day say hello to the family ." plastic face, rubber red nose. I havent gone to the water....why? dont know...Its the hole. Wish it was at least a quiet hole.  Loud. very.  jumbled words that are mostly sounds. The holes filled with not happy smoke. Stinky smelly. I AM happy. yes , yes.....sometimes. the climb out is hard. The Hole pretends it can suck you back there and your foot slips even though it didn't. Damn holes known me to long.... I found my way out again....it sealed itself up..always does...it has a nasty surpirse attack.
