      A new dawn for Europe a somewhat suitable day for me to start my collection of thoughts. This expansion will hopefully result in more trade so more jobs for everyone, make it easier for me to go and holiday and friendlier relations to make sure anything like WWII does not happen again. This will also help strengthen Europe against the current stupid American Foreign policy. I am sure most Americans are nice, friendly people but their president is an Imbecile. I am still waiting for the “Weapons of Mass Destruction” see  urlLink http://www.coxar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/  or  urlLink  http://www.findthoseweapons.com/  for some humour.  A good example of the EU working well is when I went to Brussels recently. I had to go via Bristol as Glasgow dose not have a direct flight to Brussels Airport Zaventem (The proper one), the one nearest Brussels. I did not have to pick up my bags once, and my bags turned up at a Brussels. Also at Customs, I did not get the third degree. Another observation was that there was cross travel across Europe on the Eurostar was easily available from Brussels Noord (Gare Du Nord) to Paris, Amsterdam and various other places, the EU has helped that happen.  The transportation in Brussels is marvellous compared to Glasgow. They have 3 metro lines, 11 Tram Lines and 45 bus lines along with normal train systems. Glasgow has 1 underground line(metro),no trams and a lot of buses along with normal train systems. Glasgow and Brussels have roughly the same population(1m) and are of a similar size. The best thing about Brussels transportation is the level of integration. You walk off the plane there is then signs immediately to trains, buses and taxis all integrated into the airport. You then get on the train, leather seats in basic class very swish compared to the Pish plastic and fabric you get off Scotrail(Scottish Train Running Company).Then Get, Off at the Gard du Nord, plenty of time to get off. There was then obvious signs about how to get onto the other trains, trams, buses and taxis. Got on tram, took us to Place Rogier. The station was right under our hotel which is something you would never get in Scotland. There was also 5 entrances to this one station which is again something you would never get in Scotland. Across the road was a shopping center and under this was again a metro station, again another good example of integration.  A Little EU thought to end on-“United in Diversity”

      Well, its that time,Eurovision again.Its always a good laugh watching the totally crazy ones. The Boy band and goodlooking clones are boring, it should be about the crazy ones. The Uk's entry "James Fox" deserves nil points, he is in the above category.

      Well the expansion is know upon us, hopefully for the better. Anyway some more appropriate links. A link to the  urlLink map  of the europe with old countries , new memebers and posssible new members. Another link a picture of all the  urlLink flags of the now expaned EU.  Not much fuss here in Scotland about it in terms of events, just a small ceremony in Edinburugh. Quite a lot of news coverage here though.
