      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a program envolved with UoGateway. If you read my last post about UoGateway you would have read about free shards ran by players.Well how they do this is threw RunUo.RunUo allows you to download a shard tool to let you creat your own public shard.Now your probly thinking wow my own shard buts thats got to be hard to do. Well it is sorta tuff to do. First you have to download the beta 36 from there you can figure out how to get shard up and running.But that doesnt make it public. Yes your shard is up and it is running but to make it public you must goto  urlLink http://www.uogateway.com &nbsp;and click where it says add public server. Type in all the info required and there you have it within half an hour you will have your own public shard. Now there are great risks in having your own public shard such as if you have cable you must open up your router and disable your fire wall leaving you open to hackers. If you have Dsl then you do not have a router so alls you must do is take down your Fire Wall. If you have Dial Up then i would suggest not thinking of making your own shard because it would be so laggy would could not move since your shard runs as fast as your connection runs. I would suggest playing UoGateway for a while before thinking about making your own shard.If you are thinking about making your own shard here is the web site you download the beta (the shard) off of.  urlLink www.runuo.com &nbsp;If you do make a shard please let me know and i will be more than happy to come on your shard.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UoGateway is the same as uo only with many differences. In UoGateway you do not pay any money to play. the reason you do not pay is because UoGateway is made up of 100s of player ran shards (free shards) that you do not pay to play. it is a fun way to get use to Ultima Online before you buy the real game. If you are thinking of playing both UoGateway and Ultima Online do not ever use your real Ultima Online password on UoGateway. Because people might then be able to access you Ultima Online account (the one you pay for). If you wish to download UoGateway it is a fast simple download right off there web site. urlLink http://www.uogateway.com

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultima Online is a huge online multi player game. In Ultima Online you may choose from lots of different skills such as Blacksmithing, Tailoring, Magery, Swordsmanship, Archery, and many many more. This game has now been around for seven years and is still very popular. there are many servers such as Legends, Atlantic, and tons more. To play Ultima Online you must pay a mounthly fee. There are many different ways to pay for your UO account. There is Pay Pale, Credit Card, Time Cards, and a couple other ways as well. I have been playing UO for five and a half years now. Yes it has its boring times and good times as do all games. But this is one game you have to try. When you first join you get one mounth free. If you would like to join UO or are thinking about it here is there web site address so you can take a farther look into the many worlds of Ultima Online  urlLink http://www.uo.com
