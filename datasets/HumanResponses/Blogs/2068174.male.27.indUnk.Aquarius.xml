Everything must be handed in... the assignments, presentation and 'ol those stuffs... Well, it' s just a normal life as a student... I'm gonna have a test tomorrow... so really have to concentrate on this.... Yesterday, it was a lovely day... sunny and windy, just feels like back home... today, it's gloomy, raining.... That's Melbourne's wheather... nobody could ever predicts..... Anyway, the wheather doesn't affects me that much, since i'm gonna be stucked in my room, study... and study....   I haven't yet be able to go to Vic Market... to buy souvenirs... still busy, hopefully, by the end of next week... i'll be able to finish all of these study stuffs.... Ramadan is coming... It's the month full of blessings and goodness...   I guess that's all for this week... I don't have any ideas left to talk about... Till next edition....

      It's a Sunday Mornin'  It's a very cold morning.... Sitting in front of my laptop... finishing my VPN proposal, while eating Weet-Bix (everyday menu) for breakfast.... Last Night I went to the Malaysia Hall End-of-Semester Dinner... It's fantastic... with performances from students, and excellent foods (Lontong and Soto). I reached back home almost 12.30 midnight. Luckily there's Hairol (PhD students, Melbourne Uni) who sent me home... I still feels sleepy... I woke up at 5 am...  Yesterday, I went to a world event... yeah... Rugby World Cup 2003. I went to watch the macth between the All Blacks and the Azurri (Italians)... It was an excellent match. First, I was quite impressed with the stadium... Telstra Dome in Melbourne... It's huge and beautiful. I went there alone, since all my housemates are buzy (me as well)... It was a good performance by the All Blacks (viva All blacks!!!) they crushed the Italians with 70 - 7 score. Please wait for the pixs to be uploaded very soon!!   Today, I plan to go to Vic Market (Victoria Market), as to find some souvenirs to bring back home... Malaysia... If, I could manage to finish my VPN proposal....

My project works are getting heavier and quite complicated... anyway.. that's my life.... the way that i have chosen and have to go through..... For me... i wish that my life is always in a god's blessing and i hope that i would be able to share and contribute my knowledge to others.... InsyaAllah.....

        New year with new resolution?? Hopefully.....    It's been quite a while, since I haven't wrote anything....   For the past two months I wasn't around... I went back to Malaysia for Hari Raya... It was wonderful to be @ home again, but I believed that my vacation was too short!! I went back to Malaysia for almost a month, but yet I couldn't meet everybody...  I came back to Melbourne on the 6th of December... I was quite busy back then, since I have to organized myself, as to prepare for the project works.   Despite the busy schedule, I still got time to enjoy myself. I just came back from Tasmanian tour (it seems to be the whole island tour!). I've been there for about 6 days, together with my colleagues from Sydney. It was a wonderful and breathtaking trip... I can say that it is an unforgettable journey, through mountains and beaches.   Well, the weeks ahead are full with tasks that need to be completed.... Hopefully I could manage everything... Till the next log!!!

        Livin' in the best city in the world....      Melbourne has been declared as the best city in the world, alongside vancouver.... by the Economist Intelligent Unit (EIU). This city got almost perfect rating for all criterias, except the weather.... Well, it's true... Melbourne's weather is so unpredictable.... It can be hot and sunny in the morning, and freezing cold in the afternoon.... Anyway, it's good to be here in Melbourne....  For the past few weeks, my life is still covered with project's stuffs that need to be accomplished. Hope that I could put myself together... to accomplish these stuffs ASAP. Still got a month to go, before the real semester starts....  Well, that's all that I've been havin' so far... nothing great change has yet to appear in my life..... I always pray to Allah that my life would always be in prosperity... and always hope to be a better man!......
