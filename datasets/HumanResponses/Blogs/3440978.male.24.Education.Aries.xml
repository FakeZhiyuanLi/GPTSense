      A crazyass dream last night, possibly due to talking about the Last Samurai way too much before it. I shall do my best to replicate it. I apologize for the poor quality of writing (as usual), but I am trying to record most of the facts as quickly as possible before I forget them.  The striking replica of Gene Hackman (similar to his role in "The Quick and the Dead") stood in front of me, menacing, confident, with a gleam of power in his 60-year old eyes. A battered leather jacket did nothing to cover up the scars of someone that had seen death breathing hard into his eyes. A slight limp in his right leg kept no memories of the swamps he had trekked through years ago. He didn't seem to need anyone for anything when he slapped the check and the briefcase in front of me.  Yet I was selected, a Chinese teenager near adulthood, to be his accomplice. The jetplane trip was but a microsecond long in the fragmented dream that was my reality. We were there in no time, a nondescript island filled with Asiatic people who spoke broken English, yet communicated with the expressions on their faces that sounded as clear to me as tongues I hear in my bubble home at Harvard.  But in a dream, I had no attachment to my classes nor my parents, just sent out on this mission into a desert village, where I soon became one of the two holders of power over all others, be they strong men, curious women, or fragile children. The other holder of power was G (which is what I will call him)'s black pistol.  It seems that whatever G was up to was already in progress for a long time. Hauling trucks and a tool shed stood out amongst stone buildings and huts. In the far north, acting as the barrier of this village to the rest of the world to all but the feathered brethern and G's helicopter, stood a tall, menacing mountain with a crack in the middle, barely enough for a party of four to enter through.  (Note: imagine in The Return of the King, the path that Aragorn has to walk through to get to the crypt)  My job there seemed to be a combination of witness, translator, and second-in-command. For whatever reason, G was not able to communicate with them with more than his eyes, grunts, or a pistol. The unknown power that was manifested as a result of my owning of this dream allowed me to speak to them at will, without moving my mouth.  But they weren't yet ready to speak with me.  Every day, a small party of strong, black-haired men would enter the space between the mountains. For some reason, the two Western-tinted men here did not partake in this trip, though I could see through the men's eyes where they were going. There seemed to be a green valley, lush and vibrant with plant life. Admist of the green scenery shimmered the glint of a gold that was purer than the sun that never seemed to go way. Nights seemed to be nonexistent in this village of my dreams.  Every afternoon (if the concept existed), the men would haul back. . . something. Something with that glint that drove G's eyes mad with ecstasy. The substance would then be hoarded in warehouse.  The more happy G got, the more sadness I felt in the men's eyes. They were frequently directed with hatred at G's domineering figure, but then moved sadly to the black pistol-case that hung at his waist.  Days. Weeks. Months?  The sun that flooded the valley seemed to be weaker day by day, as more of the mysterious golden substance was taken. I communicate with the men, but they only answer in sighs. Maybe they didn't want Gene to get the wrong idea.  Gene disapproved of my meeting with the others. But he had no power over what I did secretly. It was my dream, not his. I befriended a hotheaded youth named B. I see in him a reflection of myself, only without a past in academics, a warm home, or food that I have long taken for granted.  Days. Weeks. Months?  The resignation seemed to turn to anger. Winds howled. What seemed to be once day was now only night. For some reason, I yearned to the men, as if I were destined to be one of them. They also approached me more, probably as a result of my contact with B.  On the bleak morning of one of these days, the tension broke.  B, with a strength of mind that could not be contained by his meager, malnutritioned body, stared into G's face when the daily retrieval party was to be formed, cursing at him in a language that G wouldn't understand. But to me, it was the most pure form of hatred I had ever seen in life. I shuddered when hearing his words before even understanding what they meant. But I knew instantly what I had to do.  I eyed the rest of the villagers. In my eyes I said: "Come closer. It is about to be all over."  Men, from age of fifteen to fifty, slowly picked up the branches near them, coming closing, forming a circle that wouldn't break.  For once, G's nonchalant smirk faded. He held a not-so-steady pistol up to the young man, who stared into the blackness that will at any second be his death.  In growls and grunts to each other in foreign languages, the two backed up steadily. B was stopped short by the wall of the warehouse standing behind him. Gene is about to back into a mob that is slowly forming. He senses this, and gave a pleading look to me, who was standing, silent, melancholy.  "Back me up." He throws me a silver pistol, identical in structure to the black. I caught it. A shiver resonates through my wrist, my elbow, and all the way through my heart.  A small step later, his shoulder touched mine. He motioned for the helicopter behind us: "Let's get out of here."  I eyed the twenty-year-old man behind him closest to us. Mentally and verbally I said, "please. In two seconds." Though I had two different targets, and two different meanings.  I jump for the black pistol, the source of fear that has plagued the village for too long. The training as a soldier paid off. All I could grab was empty air as his elbow went swiftly up, out of my reach. I gritted my teeth and looked up at his eyes. I saw death.  Coming back to balance, I shoot my silver pistol at his face. It had no bullets.  I lunge at his stomach. Not having punched with intention to injure in three years. He blocks my punch with his other elbow.  "NOW!" I plea mentally. I dodge his grab with my left shoulder, and jump straight into him, shoulders knocking the left arm that held the pistol up more. I sensed Death touching me.  By now, the man behind me had already run up to the battle in the middle of the ring, and grabbed G from behind.  Cursing, G was held back as the shot went off. I heard a growl of agony, and I yelled, making a simultaneus connection with his jawbone with my left and a grab of black pistol with my right.  Two more bouts, I was five feet from my employer, with the pistol aimed at his forehead.  He smiled and didn't say anything. Somehow I knew that if I killed him now, I would have no way of flying back to the safety of the Square. But another moan sounded behind me, and I turned around and saw B, with a wound in his chest, taking his last breath and plunging to death. I hear a ruffle. Without the visual stimulous, I know it was G's final bid for the gun that sat in my hand.  I cry like I have never cried before, and unload the last bullet the pistol would ever shoot into G's heart.  Days. Weeks. Months?  The burial is complete. The restored sun now shines on B's grave where the warehouse once was. The villagers go back to everyday activities. I am now a part of them. I no longer understand English. My battered t-shirt and jeans is now replaced by a loose-fitting woven cloth that everyone in the village wore.  The oldest of them looks at me. Without moving his lips, I heard "you are ready".  Three villagers, smiling, forms a protective group around me and escort me into the valley.  Now, passing safely through the crack of the mountain, I set my eyes on something more beautiful than I had ever seen, in a dream or in real life. Though when I saw it, I instantly realized it was a dream. I told myself: "I will forget when I wake up."  Then, I did.  The end. Even now, I don't remember exactly what I saw in the valley, though the other events are as clear as day.  Maybe I never will.

      Go to the website listed below to see this Honda commercial being aired in the U.K.....you won't believe it! There are no computer graphics or digital tricks in the film. Everything you see really happened in real time exactly as you see it. The film took 606 takes. On the first 605 takes, something, usually very minor, didn't work. They would then have to set the whole thing up again. The film cost six million dollars and took three months to complete. In addition, it's two minutes long. However, it is fast becoming the most down loaded advertisement in Internet history.   urlLink http://www.daboyz.org/honda/

      Last week I hung out LOL!!1 went swimmin' and cliff jumpin' again. Then ARML! We left Thursday morning and spent a total of four days on the bus. The tournament was at Penn State, and lemme tell you: more than just math happened on this trip. First, I rolled my ankle, making it swell up to five times its normal size (PERHAPS AN EXAGGERATION but it was really swollen). Then, the night before the contest, I played "Killer Frisbee" (as Mrs. P called it). Night time. Five frisbees. Danger.  I caught a frisbee with my nose. It cut me and gave me a nosebleed. T and I couldn't find any ice so we walked to the Pollock Commons and got a soda can to act as ice. I got some interesting looks walking along holding a soda can on my face with one hand and a blood-stricken tissue over my nose with the other. The nosebleed didn't stop for two hours, so at 1:00 AM (I think) we call an ambulance. The EMT comes to help me out, and they finally get it to stop bleeding. What a trip. They wanted to take me to the emergency room but that would have cost 200 bucks NO DICE.
