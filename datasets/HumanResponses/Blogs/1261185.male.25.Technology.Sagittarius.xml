      Money gets me down. if I had it my way I wouldn't have any of the shit. but since I am  living in a fucking society where to be without money is considered to be without life, I am forced to deal with it for the time being.  Nothing in the existence of mankind has caused more deaths and attrocities than the lust for power and the greed for money.  Not much else seems to matter to some people and for them I am sincerely worried.  We live in a materialistic society but the thing that is disturbing and ironic is that if I didn't live in a materialistic society then I would not be able to post this and bitch about it in this manner.  Most societies, as far as I am aware, that are more focused on the self instead of the outer gainings of the world are slightly backward technologicalybecause of their lack of desire to compete in an ever growing technologicaly based capitalist society.  For these countries to emerge to the capitalist world is a very difficult challenge, one that is forced upon them in many cases by outside forces.  I personnally do not think that they should be forced to do so, if civilazations suck as occupied Tibet, Nepal, Sri Lanka, etc. are not allowed to stay as they are and emerge with their own peed into the materialistic world then they maylose those various traits that make their societies so special.  And to change the capitalist countries into the something more inwardlyt motivated would almos certainly destabilize all of the governments of the western nations.  Mot to mention that it is something that won't be allowed to happen by the power-hungry, greedy politicians and businessmen that control these countries.

      OK I watched this earlier and am somewhat confused.  SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!  At the beginning of this bad-ass Japanese flick about a government sanctioned free-for-all killing spree between the members of a single Japanese 9th grade class, they announce the winner as a young, bloody, girl.  And yet at the end they announce the winner as a boy!  Maybe I missed something here butI don't think I did.  If some one would please explain this to me I would appreciate it. Just post a comment, notlike anybody is actually reading this.    On a lighter note my co-worker Dennis and his wife Rhonda gave Courtney and I one of our first baby shower presents.  Thanks to them soo much for all the great stuff.  Peace.

      Well this morning the Hare Krishnas came through town in a horse drawn buggy.  As would be expected in this small town in which I work they no-doubt brought out several by-standers, some rather off-color comments, the cops, and a little twinkling of hope in at least one bystander, me.    The Krishnas stopped at a local Shell gas station to spray down their horses with a water hose and attracted some attention bringing people out of the near-by offices and houses to see the rather unusual yellow carriage drawn by two horses, a rare site outside Pennsylvania I would imagine.  No doubt some of the people in town assumed that they were in fact, "rag-heads", "habibs", or a "militant Islamic group  hell-bent on changing our religious views" (can you believe that shit?).  It turned out to be none of the above, it was the Hare Krishnas.    For some reason whenever people see others who are obviously from a different cultural background, most people get scared and fear the worse, well it happened again here.  The cops showed up and asked them a lot of questions, suspicion eventually turning into curiosity, and then they were off.  Traveling down the highway doing their Padayatra (a sort of pilgrimage to no where to spread the Hare Krishna loving mantra).       The couple in the wagon has logged over 12,000 miles on the roads of the U.S. traveling, I believe to Mexico.  They meant no harm, they meant no dis-respect, and yet people gawked and stared and pointed mouthing slurs both racial and religious as they did nothing more than spray down the steaming legs and back of their horses.  It makes me happy to see that, to see a seemingly far-off culture come into such a sheltered society and open their eyes, not with fear and hatred, but with love and curiosity, and in my case hope.  The hope that more will come through and open these peoples eyes just a little bit further.  Peace

      I am fucking tired today guys!  I spent some extra cash that shouldn't have been spent last night on some new shorts so I am definitely going to be broke for a little while.  We had our weekly meeting this morning and so I had to be here at 7:30 this morning and try like hell to stay the fuck awake long enough to look interested about the same old shit again, retold for the newbies.  Courtney went to the doctor yesterday and she does not have gestation's diabetes, thank goodness!!  That was a huge load off my mind for sure!    So I am leaving for Vegas next Wednesday and I am trying to get my shit in order before I go.  Also we are going to the shitty Texas beach this weekend with Courtney's family and her step-son Stephen.  We should have fun, regardless of the seaweed and possible sludge that will be present.  More later.

      Just another thought....  I am reading alot recently of the Forgotten Realms series of fantasy books currently being published by Wizards of the Coast.  Two books in particular are standing out right now. 1)   Twilight Falling   by Paul S. Kemp and  2)   Spellfire   by the great Ed Greenwood  First Twilight:  This book is good and is addictive, man.  I loved it.  It follows the adventures of one Erevis Cale, a former assassin and a Cleric of Mask to boot, as he tries to avenge the murder and invasion of his former employer's estate (where he was a butler).  This is a very good book and will grab hold of you by the balls and never let you go!  I am waiting to get the second book now and I will let you know more about it then.  As for Spellfire I am still reading it.  Get the NEW REVISED EDITION!  You will thank me guys it fills in holes that were left open from the first printing of this book.  I'll  fill ya'll in more once I am finished!  Peace.

      OK  Some drama here at ProMiles Software Development corp. this afternoon guys!  Two people one old man and one younger, crack-whorish, looking woman got into a heated debate that ended with both parties walking down the road a block and entering the local law offices of H.D. Pate just before the cops showed up.  The woman was histerical and screaming, "Mark, please don't leave me!!  I don't want to go to jail!  I can't BREATHE!  I can't BREATHE!  I can't BREATHE!"  and falls on her butt, gets up and follows after the older gentleman, think of an elderly trucker with crazy eyes, around the corner to the law firm.  It's things like that that makes working here sooo nice!! lol  =)

      Well People, nobody reads this so it won't matter but I am now married!  That's right married!  Courtney and I tied the knot officially on May 28, 2004 at about 11.00 am at the Justice of the Peace in Beaumont.    Afterwards we went up to Toledo Bend Lake and stayed there until Sunday (I was working for double-time on Memorial Day so we couldn't stay longer).  Everyone has asked if it felt any different being married and honestly it doesn't at all.  We ahve been together long enough all ready, I suppose to move past the "I'm living with someone blues" and we have a baby on the way to boot.    On a lighter note I am going to actually start updating this blog more and more often with pics and such of my day to day life, this is much easier than upkeeping my website since I am w/o a pc at the house now.  (My motherboard fried and money is tight, in other words I can't justify a new board for myself with the baby on the way.)  P.S. here's my baby!

      O.K. we have a little kitten in our house now, my stepson named him Spidey (the cat is solid white by the way and pink eyes).  We have all fallen in love with this cat and especially me grown attached to the little 'hellcat'.  But yesterday the landlord came by and told us we could not have the cat, even though he said we could beforehand, and that we would still have to pay the   $400 pet deposit  , of which $175 is non-refundable) even though just a month maybe two ago he said that we could get a cat if we had a letter written by Stephen, my stepson, to him requesting that he could keep a cat.    All conditions were met and still the   WORTHLESS-ASS-FUCKED-STEROID-HOUND-OF-A-SKYCAP-COCK-SUCKER   still won't let us have the fucking cat. So now I have to figure out of I can keep the cat and afford to pay the $400 deposit or maybe get the KITTEN neutered   AND   declawed in order to bring down the price of the deposit.

      So I am going to Las Vegas on Wednesday morning and I am going to be there for about 5 days or so for the Las Vegas Truck Show.  Yeah yeah yeah Vegas is great and all but I have three main things here that are hanging against me on this trip:  1)I am not going with my wife Courtney, who I am going to miss dearly 2)I am not seeing the Cirque du Soleil's O when I am there 3)I am going to Vegas on a business trip that will occupy AT LEAST 9 hours everyday I am there, excluding the 13th, Sunday, when I will be flying home at around 1.pm.  These three factors have already taken away greatly from mypleasurable experiences availiable on the trip.  If only I could have conned the company into paying the $160 ticket for Cirque I would have been happy!  BUT NOOOOOOO!!!!  They don't want Brian to have a good time on the trip to Vegas, they want him to WORK!!  I mean what the FUCK!?!?!  =)  I hopefully will have fun.

      Well I finished reading   Spellfire   by Ed Greenwood and it was a fairly good book.  I must admit that I started reading the book to hear mainly about Shandril Shessair's, main character, infamous ability of slinging spellfire, an extremely rare ability to throw raw magic as flames to harm and heal and also absorbs spell affects thrown at her.  Needless to say even in her vast inexperience she is an extremely dangerous person capable of slaying dragons, men, and mountains alike.    It is a very atypical Forgotten Realms novel since the main character, for more than half of the book, is a snot-nosed weakling incapable of defending herself against the dangers of the wild, much less the Zhents, the Followers of Bane, and the Cult of the Dragon, not to mention any mage of note coming after her in a repetitious folly of certain and the last second save of a Knight of Myth Drannor.  All of that aside it is a very good book capable of holding your attention as each page turns to see how powerful and dangerous this spellfire really is.  Overall a good book.

      Well guys I am back from the trade show in Las Vegas.  I have to say that it was alot of fun but I was ready to be home, I was missing my wife and the humidity.  I came down with some serious sinus issues on Friday morning, I was all clogged up and no humidity was present to get it out.       The two finest hotels/casinos in Vegas are  The Venetian  and the  Paris , they are absolutely beautiful.  The best club would have to have been Coyote Ugly inside the  New York, New York  that place was happening.  My wife will be happy to know that I did not see any bare breasts, no showgirls guys sorry.  All in all I am very glad to be home and 2 to 3 days in Vegas is enough for me, especially without my wifey.  Oh and I got sick there did I mention that?  So yeah I fell like poooo!  Ain't life grand!

      Well the baby shower was on Saturday!  Thanks to everyone who showed up, Fuck everyone who didn't. (just joking people, damn can't take a joke at all!)  The AC at my sis-in-law's house went out on the hottest day of thesummer naturally also the same day of the shower, so everyone was sweating bulets the whole time. All in all though, from what people are telling me at least, the shower was alot of fun and I know I at least had a good time so what the fuck.    And now for today, I wanted to go home on the way here today and I am ready to go home even more here in a few minutes.  This day has dragged so much ass that it damn near feels like wednesday afternoon.  I am going to go home and eat and then sit my ass down on the couch with my woman and watch a fucking movie.  And better yet, the cat is gone so I will probaly be able to sleep the whole night through without Courtney and/or I chasing it off of us in the middle of the night.  So things are getting better the closer five o'clock gets here but not by much.  Thanks again guys for everything that we got at the shower but I hope this is over soon!  I wanna go play some more D&D man!  LOL!  No I can't wait for my baby girl to get here!  My sweet Jillian Nicole Murphy is just around the corner.
