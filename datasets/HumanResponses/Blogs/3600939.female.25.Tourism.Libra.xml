      It's the 26th of June.  Is it so much to ask that it be warm and sunny enough that I'm not nervous about leaving the house without a jacket and an umbrella?

      I give a lot of credit to the people who decide which order to put songs on a cd in. I'm making a disc for a friend, and I'm having a restupidously tough time deciding what order it should all go in. It's an art, really, especially if you're trying for a particular mood or message. And I'm not even. I just want it to sound right.  Also, I'm rather enjoying  urlLink Radio Paradise  lately. You might too, if you're looking for something kind of mellow and pretty to listen to while you clean the house or drink tea or write poems.

      Yes, I realize a month ago I gave up having a personal blog because I don't have anything to say. Whatever.  I realized that even though I didn't have a whole lot to blog about, I missed it when it was gone. (and, J-Rod showed me this pretty pink template, and I just had to have it. Me and my pair of pretty pink blogs,  to match my shoes)  So, last night we threw a party, kind of a staff get together for all the people J works with. Pretty good time, I must say. If you haven't seen our apartment, you need to know that it is the perfect place for a gathering (except, we don't really have a table. I think it'd be better if we did, but whatever).  We could probably get 75 people in here standing up. Not that we're gonna try, but I'm just saying.  I love love love having parties, and last night was a goodly one.  If we had a table, I'd have everyone over for a sophisticated dinner party (don't worry kids, I'd still let you wrestle and dance around) but 'til then it's just gonna be the standing around type.

      Happy July 1st everyone!  Like many of my fellow Canadians, deep down I'm fiercly patriotic. I don't litter. I say 'please', 'thank you', and 'eh' an awful lot . I've eaten moose! I know what a chesterfield is (and I've even spilled poutine on one. Pass the serviettes!). I believe in hockey. I think the Queen is pretty alright. We have the prettier half of Niagara Falls. I've kissed boys from 7 different provinces!  I can hum the 'hinterland who's who' music, the 'hockey night in Canada' theme song, the theme from 'the friendly giant', and several Tragically Hip tunes.  And I get a little weepy when I hear 'O Canada' played. I love it here. It's the kick-assest country on the planet, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.
