      Today I was reading around the 'Net, reading the blogs and such in my on-going agonized effort to make some sense of the world, and ran across this, in a preview of a book called "Understanding the F Word: American Fascism and the Politics of Illusion" by  by David McGowan, which caused me a bit of reflection of course given my stream-of-consciousness musing about American dreaming last time:   ***  "Not long ago, my teenage daughter asked me why it was that so many people she has met in her life suffer from low self-esteem. Why indeed? The answer, it turns out, is quite simple: we are all victims of one of the big lies of American society - the one that says that if we educate ourselves, work hard, and apply our talents, there is absolutely nothing we cannot achieve.  We are taught from birth that anyone in this great country can rise up to the highest strata of society if they so choose, that if we have the drive and ability, nothing can hold us back. George W. Bush articulated this very message from the campaign trail recently when he said: "One of the wonderful things about America is, it doesn't matter who you are or where you're from. If you work hard, dream big, the notion of owning your own business applies to everybody."  Conversely, if we should fail we have no one but ourselves to blame, for we must not be smart enough, talented enough, or educated enough - or we just didn't try hard enough. The brutal reality though is that in the real world, the sons of the rich and powerful will assume their fathers' seats in the boardrooms of America regardless of their qualifications (George, Jr. being a prime example), while the most talented of kids from America's 'inner cities' will live and die without ever seeing the world beyond the confines of their neighborhoods.  That is the reality for the majority of Americans. And yet we are encouraged, in fact required, to set goals for ourselves that are impossible to attain, to buy into the Big Lie. When we inevitably fail to achieve these goals, which the social structure has deliberately put out of our reach, we are required to blame only ourselves. The system has not failed you, you have failed because you are a fucking loser. You're too fucking lazy to succeed. You're too fucking stupid to succeed. So stop looking for scapegoats and accept the fact that you determine your own fate."  ****   I mean, jeez, what a horror to see phrases I used in Bush quotes and to think of myself as a fully indoctrinated American dreamer, but I don't disagree with the notion that America isn't really a democracy so much a soft-gloved fascism run by corporate power. The thing is, even given McGowan's "Big Lie," the alternative, a life of constant losing warfare against The Power with the attendant cynical rage, seems so much worse. Those without the heart for militancy (I mean, who wants to stand around in front of Starbucks all day long) just go apathetic. I mean, I've seen this. So, you know, maybe American dreaming is consensual hallucination, but it does work, I've seen it work, and I think that hope is just more constructive and useful than rage.    Hey, I even got a "poor immigrant" story to seal my right-wing credentials: I once had a Polish girlfriend named Ewa, who came over to the States while I was still in college. She had almost no resources at all. Most of her family was still in Poland, and the mother she had in the States, who had helped her get the green card, went nutty almost the day she arrived and basically abandoned her. Ewa had to come live with her penniless American college-student boyfriend. Ewa didn't have money, or education, or assets of any kind really other than her intelligence. But, you know...she went out and she got a little job, and then saved a little money to afford a few classes at the community college, and when she got her little two-year degree in mathematics, after having ROCKED through to a perfect grade-point average, she got accepted into the computer science program at the University of Washington, which is moderately expensive, but there are financial aid programs to help you quite a bit if you are older than 26. And she worked some more, and did great, and made connections, and had a very well-paying job set up for herself before she graduated (with honors), and now she makes more money than I'll ever see and is probably a lot more successful in her field than I'll ever be.   And yeah, yeah, yeah, "rags-to-riches" stories are so boring, but the point is that they happen, and they happen because people like Ewa believe they can happen. The rags-to-riches "myth" is a big part of the larger American myth, but it's not a bad myth, as myths go. People have always lived their lives instructed by myths (or, if you prefer, lies), like you know, religions and stuff, and I just think that living as though the American myth of possibility were true isn't the least positive faith to have. If some poor kid in some kind of urban nightmare in America at least believes in the possibility of escape, is that a bad thing? Is it better for some intellectual guy like McGowan to say, "Sorry kid; you're fucked for life because the corporations control everything, and the only hope you can possibly have to bring the entire system down, which is never going to happen."  I mean, yes of course we need to struggle against injustice and greed and the horrors spread across the  world by corporate greed and heartlessness, but, for me, this can't happen at the expense of my valued myths. So I can agree that Bush's assertions are full of political bullshit, but lies aren't necessarily untrue if they are understood as myths in the old sense of stories to live by. (Okay...I guess I feel a little better now about my accidental support of President Dimwit.)  I might be going out to Birkenau next week. So there will be some absolute truth for me there to keep me re-thinking all this about myths and dreams and lies and truths...

      I guess if pressed a few years ago about why I wanted to teach in Eastern Europe, I would have mumbled something about wanting to experience more of the world and other cultures, or a similar platitude. I think I remember something about being alienated by America's artifice and obsession with surfaces, wanting to shake off all the plastic and leave the theme-park. (Or maybe I was just pissed off that I couldn't get an American girlfriend--my heart is such a trackless swamp for me.)   But what's interesting, and I'm speaking only for myself here of course, is that by immersing myself in  Polish life I've learned far more about my own identity as an American than I have about Polish/European culture. I can't say anything about American identity in absolute terms, there are many kinds of Americans of course, but I have learned something more about what being American means for me. If you had asked me before I left to talk about my American cultural (I don't want to go so far as to say "national," I'm speaking in cultural terms here, not nationalistic ones) identity, I probably, just out of grad school, would have denied or rejected it, but after being in Poland for awhile, I've come to some appreciation of Americans, and an affection for American culture I never had when I lived in Washington.   (American) ideology is a medium more than an idea: when I was immersed in it, I couldn't really perceive it. We talked constantly about American ideology in college, analyzed it and critiqued it, but without any real perspective; we were just watching TV and then blowing big words out of our butts in efforts to impress each other with our vast perspicacity (that's a joke). We could see little traces of something here and there, but since you can't step outside your own ideological environment all that easily, we were missing the essential, the pervasive. But now having put myself in another ideological medium, this Polish one, it feels like I have achieved some perspective, the shreds of my American background clinging to me stand out in such contrast to my environment here that I can see them.   So how do I feel as an American? What does it mean for me? I think it comes down to the tired old cliche of   the "American Dream," which I could probably have articulated a few years ago, but don't think I ever really understood until I had spent some time in Poland. It has little to do with a house and a car and a lifestyle, but just the basic, fundamental, absolute belief that if you can envision something, and you give it all you got, you can make it happen. Just that, the primacy of the imagination--the "Daydream Nation." It's not "optimism," really, which is more of a facile "things are going to be okay" kind of feeling. It's more of a basic, fundamental assumption that the world is a place of possibility, and possibilities are created rather than found.   For me, and I think for many Americans like me, failure is personal. It's rarely somebody's fault. It's never because you were born into the wrong family or in the wrong place. If you fuck up, it's your fault. You should have tried harder. You should have got up earlier in the morning. (Henry Rollins said something like this once, something like "There are lots of people smarter and more talented than me; I just get up earlier in the morning.") I think this assumption gives lots of Americans their energy and curiosity: if the world is full of possibility...well, hell, there's lots to discover, to enjoy, to explore, to pursue. (A traditional high-school graduation gift in the US is luggage--"there's the world kid; now go out there and do something.") No idea is too crazy for most Americans: You want to build a rocket in your backyard? Hey, good idea. You want to make a career playing computer games? Go for it. Start a religion? Be my guest. For Americans, nothing is ever vivid enough; imagination and ambition are virtually synonymous, and play is profoundly important.    (I think I understand the basic difference between "liberal" Americans and "conservative" Americans now as the difference between those who feel that governments should try to allow maximum potential for everyone to pursue their dreams regardless of how outrageous and bizarre they might seem as long as nobody's getting hurt, and that this should include genuine assistance to failures and fuck-ups because a person's potential doesn't end until death and everyone deserves lots of second chances to find their happiness, and those who feel that competition is sacred and that nothing should interfere with it, preserving social traditions is more important than individual happiness, and that winners should take all--if you lose, hey, "I got mine. Fuck you. It's every crumb for himself.")  The dream is also what fuels our dark side--when such dreams go blind and stupid and heartless (i.e. Bush administration) you get things like runaway greed, and contempt for the poor, and senseless violence, and Iraq. But there is such beauty in it when it works; there is beauty just in the fact that America is one of the most dynamically multicultural societies on the planet and that it works as well as it does--that so many of us hold a multicultural, society as something not just to be tolerated, but celebrated. (Something I really never truly appreciated until I had lived for a time in this 99% white, catholic, Polish monoculture.) There's beauty in the 60's, and surf movies, and John Lee Hooker, and the half-dozen or so amateur space projects in the US right now, and the American community college system (in which the average age of students is about 30--good luck getting into college over 30 in Poland) and in the pure frivolous delight of roller-coasters and comic-book conventions and Spiderman movies.   Poland really helped me to appreciate American goofiness, and just how important it is for me. Most Polish adults almost never play. I don't mean "party," they do plenty of that, but just, you know, fly a kite, throw a frisbee, goof off in a park with giant soap bubbles or model rockets. It happens, but rarely, and other people will tend to stare in suspicion ("Is he drunk?"). Dead seriousness sets in at about nine years of age. They do enjoy themselves I guess, but there is a shroud of reserve over everything, an embarrassment that seems to accompany really delighting in something, because, you know, you don't want to give yourself over to too much enjoyment of the world. That would be undignified...kind of drunken. (I think this is why Poles love pubs so much--for the escape from The Dour.)  I've spent a few years now among the college-age people of Poland, and from my perspective, which I now understand to be an American perspective, the time has been  pretty sad. I'm not saying that my perception of Polish culture is entirely accurate, but that my identity as an American has put a certain angle on my perception, and how I see Polish culture has told me a lot about how I see myself and the culture I've come from. Here, with a few exceptions, there does not seem to be the basic assumption that the world is full of possibility and that dreaming works; the prevalent assumptions here seem to be that the world is full of obstacles and traps and corrupt people who will do what they can to cheat you, that dreams set you up for disappointments, that powers are stacked against you, and to get something you want, you either have to be entitled to it by virtue of birth, craftier than the people trying to cheat you, have really good connections with people who already have cheated their way in, or else really lucky. There's not a lot of common trust. There's a tremendous amount of blaming: it's the government's fault, it's the boss's fault, it's the system's fault, it's the teacher's fault. (Soon, it will be the European Union's fault.) Success is something to be suspicious of, or envied, and successful Poles are usually sure to lord it over those below them to keep them in their place.    My students would always deny that this was pessimism. They would say they were just being realistic, pragmatic. It looked a lot like hopelessness and resignation from where I was standing. "It won't make any difference" is not exactly a rousing call to positive action. Might as well just go to the pub, or church, or maybe church and then the pub, or retreat into some family sanctuary or other where you can feel safe. I rarely saw much value placed on imagination, innovation, or work. I rarely saw much value placed on individual accomplishment. Most of my students didn't seem to think these things would help them; those who got around having to work were more admired than people who actually did the work (and who were made to feel foolish for having tried so hard more often than not). Being caught cheating on tests and assignments was never a source of shame, but getting away with it was a source of pride. My students were constantly trying to "beat" my assignments--find the loopholes, the short-cuts.   (Of course, anytime in history Poles have been faced with some gigantic threat or crisis, they find themselves coming together to do really amazing and dramatic things, like, oh, peacefully defeating the USSR--but, as Poles will be the first to admit, most of the time they have a hard time agreeing on anything.)  It's a bleak ideological environment for an American (which I now understand myself to be owing to the contrast) to find himself in, and I saw the result of it over and over and over in my classes: students who seemed to have lost most of their joy and their curiosity about the world, who were afraid to dream big, or dream at all, frustrated and angry students who felt that it was pointless to really try to honestly do well at anything if better cheaters were going to come along and take it all anyway, and a basic distrust and disdain of people who seemed to be sincerely trying. Students who performed very well honestly were made to feel almost embarrassed by it. Conformity and apathy and disinterest rose like smog from my classrooms, and I had to do a constant little soft-shoe routine to keep my students awake and entertained. Some of my most intelligent students withdrew into a kind of fuck-the-world nihilism. For others everything was a target of sarcasm, or a sardonic joke. Those students who were able to hang on to some curiosity and defiantly assert their intelligence, imagination, and identity in some way seemed to me to have almost superhuman intelligence, confidence, humor, and will. I remain filled with admiration for any Poles I see who seem to be dreaming big, and casting their imaginations out into the world. They are the future of this country, if it has one other than as market for cheap products from the rest of the EU, but so many of them seem to want to just get the hell out.    I don't blame Poles for this: fifty-odd years of Soviet domination, and the centuries of invasions, humiliations, and subjugation before that have obviously taken their toll, but my experience of what my Polish students would call their "realism" did give me a new appreciation of Americans. Whether or not I have an accurate perception of Polish culture is less meaningful to me than the realization that these negatives have allowed me to see my own cultural values and assumptions much more clearly than I would have at home. The contrast has made me more aware of who I am and what I value, not in a lazy, "yeah, like, personal freedom all the way, man" T-shirt kind of way, but in a way that allows me to put myself behind what I believe in a fully conscious and committed way. "Imagination"  was never really an article of faith for me until I had spent some time here.   For all our many faults, Americans have at least discovered the value in dreaming big, and lots of us are trying to make sure that imagination and curiosity and sheer goofy delight in the world remain virtues. My time in Poland has convinced me that this is a good thing--I've seen what the absence of these values results in. For Americans, reality is malleable, something to play with, work on, improve. You don't just bang your head against it. The  idea  behind something like Disneyland or Hollywood, whatever evil corporate interests you want to put behind it, isn't so much an escape from reality as it is a remaking of reality. I think Europeans often think of Americans as "fake" because they don't realize that Americans subconsciously see all reality as virtual reality, something to choose and create. Everything is art: your identity, what you eat, the way you order your coffee. We all live in our imaginations in some way, and our dreams shape our world(s); getting up and going about the day as a creative act. I think Americans decided a long time ago to make this a positive effort of will and spirit. Having lived somewhere where, as my Polish students liked to say, "life is brutal," I finally see the value of American virtuality.   A problem of course, is that American dreams are sometimes more like the delusions of the terminally self-absorbed than visions of hope, nightmares pushed into the world ahead of a gigantic economic/military machine, and this has resulted in grave misjudgment at best and horrific injustices at worst. Some kind of pathological thread runs through everything, and there is obviously the darker side to the spectrum of American experience and endeavor (if I may be allowed a convenient dichotomy), but at least my time in Poland has reminded me that there is a light side too, and real value in the American spirit. My dream of the moment is that Americans will regain our balance and overcome the fears that have driven us into pathological episodes like Iraq, and start having dreams worth sharing again. Americans will always blunder about and do stupid, lethal things for as long as we have the power to do so, but as I prepare to go home after my exile abroad, I look forward to helping America to recover some of the good in us, which is I know is there.   Ah well...some day these ideas may be fully baked. (Or is that "toasted, nicely toasted"?)

      My allergies are no longer under control, so I'm in full-on bubble-boy mode: I've sealed all the windows and retreated to an inner room with my books and computer games. Nature has been trying to kill me since I was born. Any exposure to the sexual organs of plants and their various ejaculates (i.e. flowers and pollen) and my lungs fill with snot and I'm sneezing my face off. Heavy doses of allergy drugs can prevent this, but the side effects for me are extreme fatigue, ennui, and depresssion. Fucking flowers.

      Krakow features a rather...tragic collection of "human statues" this summer. A couple of years ago, there was just the one guy parked in front of the cathedral in his bizarre statue of liberty drag; now you can't walk twenty yards without passing a new "statue." The economic situation for younger people is dire, and I guess it looked like easy money.   But at least the original would, you know, hold a pose and everything. I guess there was some kind of quasi-mime(ish) performance there. A lot of these new statues don't even hold still; they just put on a cheesy costume and sort of stand around behind a change cup. "Shrouded Beggar" is a popular theme, but I did see one guy wearing the "Scream" mask with his tatters. It's kind of depressing--brings out the sardonic cynic in me.   There is this one amazing accordion player (there's a phrase I've never used before) that's been appearing lately. Just a humble-looking guy with a repertoire of easily recognizable classical pieces. He never puts on a show or anything, just sits hunched over this giant black accordion avoiding all eye-contact, but he always draws an amazed crowd. It is something to hear "Toccata and Fugue in d minor" played PERFECTLY on an accordion. And I mean the whole damn thing, all the parts, note-perfect in perfect time, and full of virtuoso energy. He also wows his fans with the "Winter" section of "The Four Seasons." You haven't lived until you've heard Vivaldi on an accordion. I didn't even realize you could squeeze those sounds out of an accordion.  It kind of bums me out in a way...I mean here's this guy demonstrating just amazing art and skill and talent, keeping the good, important parts of us alive through what must have been years and years of diligent practice, and he's got to do it behind a change cup. I wouldn't mind seeing all the middle-managers behind change cups instead. Ah well...I guess it's always been like that. I'm just thankful for people like him, keeping civilization going, because. (He's just the opposite of some of my former students who just wanted a "good job with a good salary." Well, what kind of job? "One that pays well." But what is it that you want to DO? "Make money.")    And of course, I walked past one of his usual spots today. He wasn't there, but there were two new accordion guys, playing easily recognizable classical pieces, and it just sounded like Beethoven having an asthma attack. Poseurs faking it for the tourists. I had to go look for the original statue to cheer myself up.

      I'm coming to the end of my, uh, tumultuous four-year teaching adventure in Poland. Feeling some kind of wrap-up instinct, or at least some vague need to look around a bit, take some notes, and recollect before I head back to Americaland.   It's summer, I'm gratefully unemployed, my allergies are under control, the patches are working, the beer is cheap, and I've heard of a bakery that sells donuts, REAL donuts. Time to go swimming in the dour, sooty maze of beer gardens and crumbling masonry that is Krakow.   I can put the dentistry without anesthesia behind me now. Any country where you can meet brilliant Irish women in a salt mine several hundred feet underground can't be all bad.
