      A few days ago, I picked up  urlLink THIS .  Try it out, it's free...   Now back to the post. Well, all my life I've been playing games like Half-Life FIFA 2004, Unreal, StarCraft and more and I couldn't have cared less for games like that. But once I've started playing, it, I not only found it addictive but downright threatening to my social life. It's beautiful, yet complicated and I've won the World Cup Football [that's Soccer to you Yanks] with England guiding them to a swell victory over Germany. And this game is not all about which player plays, but where thay play and how they; alongwith how you make them play and how you substitute tham. It's a very good game, try it out...

       FRODO HAS FAILED!! THE DARK EMPEROR HAS WON!!   urlLink  CLICKY!!!    This post is not as long as the others, but the point it makes is just as good. We've seen Bushes policies over the last few years and they generally failed. With  urlLink Michael Moore's  Farenhiet 911 hitting theatres all around the world and I can tell you, it will cause a great deal of anti-Bush sentiments. Quentin Tarantino described it as "the best film I've ever seen". So hardly a few people doubt that it will stand up to it's expectations. And with Disney failing to distrubute it in the face of criticism from the White House makes me doubt the Freedom of Speech guarenteed to all US Citizens.  But the basic point this topic makes is  Bush sucks and I'm not supporting him! , just like all the other people around the world...  And in totally unrelated news,  urlLink  Frodo Baggins joins the team from the Matrix!!!

       "We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic  and to secure to all its citizens:  Justice, social, economic and political;  Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship ; Equality of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all. Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation; in our constituent assembly this twenty-sixth of November, 1949, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution."    -The Preamble to the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of India     The Preamble to the Constitution of India clearly and proudly states that India is a Secular nation. And being the world's largest democracy, India guarantees total freedom of religion to all it's citizens. This post is about the misuse of that freedom.   See, I'm a Hindu and I'm proud to be one. I would prefer Hinduism to any other religion. But a group of people have taken this concept to a larger point. Of course, thers's the Muslim League but I don't see them complaining about Hindu's in the last few decades. There's the Akali Dal and they don't complain. The only community that complains is Hindus; and they constantly complain about the Muslims. After the 14th Lok Sabha Elections, Kerala had one Minister on the 83 member parliament, and he is the head of the Indian Union Muslim League*; personally I don't care who the minister is as long as he/she is capable enough, but that's when the Hindu organizations start complaining. The VHP and Shiv Sena launching a protest against it. Well, guys, we never saw the Muslims complain when the BJP [which is a Hindu party] took office and more than 90% of the ministers in their Cabinet were Hindus.  Luckily, I live in Kerala. And Kerala is one of the country's few communist states. This election, Kerala gave 18 of it's total 20 seats to the Left Democratic Front led by the Communist Party of India(Marxist). The rest of the seats went to the Indian National Congress ally IUML and the  Bharatiya Janata Party   ally IFDP. But alas, not a single seat went to the Congress and the latter has never ever won a seat from Kerala. And fortunately, Kerala which is incidently India's most literate state with almost 99% literacy still refuses to bow to the pro-Hindu anti-Secular message spread by it.   But the problem is more rampant in the North-central India area or the Hindi heartland as some people refer to it.  The Vishwa Hindu Parishad 's Praveen Togadia - who is banned from entering almost five states - continues with his message of Anti-secularism spitting out toxic remarks at the Muslim community, at the christian community, at Pakistan and above all at Indo-Pak relations. This guy thinks he can cleanse India of all the  impure  communities and make it a Hindu republic - of the Hindus, by the Hindus and for the Hindus.   The  Shiv Sena   which roughly translates to  Lord Shiva's Army  is an entirely another story, but the content is almost the same. Last year, if I'm correct, they attacked a McDonald's outlet in Mumbai. Why did they do it? well, they  thought  it was Anti-Hindu. They thought. With aboslutely no proof. So if you think someone is bad, you just go ahead and attack them and break a few bones? But of course, they served meat, especially beef, but Hindus aren't the only people in Mumbai.  So, what can the government do about it? No, what can we do about it? Well, the only solution we can think about now is to enforce a secular way of thought in our education systems. Otherwise, just ban the bloody VHP and the SS. Anyway, India isn't perfect.  urlLink This is .  *E. Ahmad, Minister of State for External Affairs.

      Lesson One: Sending Spoofed emails, the legal way.   Note: This is for Win 98/2000/ME users only, XP tutorial will follow later.   Email spoofing is one of the simplest forms of hacking; it can hardly be defined as hacking. It makes use of one of techniques that were meant for legitimate purposes to our advantage. And the best part is that it's completely legal.  Okay, now follow these steps as it is:   Click Start -> Run -> Now type in 'telnet.exe' , without the quotes ofcourse!  A small white window opens up. This is Telnet. Telnet was basically designed by Microsoft (a.k.a The Evil Software Empire) to access your own computer from a remote PC.    Click on Connect in the Menu Bar and now click on Remote System . A small dialog box appears. There are three Boxes here. I will explain each in depth.  1. The First Text box is Titled  Host name: . The Host Name is generally the name of the remote host you are trying to access. The remote host can be a web server in which case, all you have to do is type in the URL of the website such as www.yahoo.com or www.hotmail.com. If you are trying to access a Remote PC, you will have to know the PC's I.P address.  2. The next one is titled  Port: . The definition of port is a little complex, so I'll try to keep it simple. See those little Ports behind your CPU. Yeah, the one where you fix in your mouse, keyboard, USB, Webcam and the other stuff you may have. The Telnet port is similar to these. Just like these tiny holes through which devices can 'access' your computer, there are Virtual ports through which remote PCs can access your own. There's no need to panic since the remote PC must either have permission or the password to access some of these port, especially those that can be used to harm you.  a. The basic port is the Telnet port. You can use this port sometimes to access your own computer from  remote PC, but this port has no part in Email Spoofing.  b. The next type of port is  Port #21 , which is not listed in Telnet. this is the FTP port that can be effectively used to download and upload files in a remote PC/ host. However, most servers require a Password to access through this port. Note: Port #23 can be used when you're accessing remote PCs, but the Target must have enabled File and Folder Sharing in his/her computer.  c. There's also  Port #80 , which is the standard HTML access port through which you can see the Source code of any website, but this can be achieved through Explorer as well, and Port #80 isn't important to us.   d. The one we'll be using is of course,  Port #25   which is the port that enables you to use a remote host's email program. All servers do not have the email program enabled and this is restricted to a very small number when compared to the others. And most of these servers have not enabled relaying. Relaying allows you to send mails to people who have their IDs at different servers. That is, if Hotmail had enabled relaying, you could send a mail to your friend who has an account at Yahoo. Sadly, Hotmail does not allow relaying and you are limited to sending mails only to those people who have an active account at Hotmail.  3. The third one is  Term Type:  which is the type of data you are sending to the Server. The default one is  vt100  and we won't need to change that.  ascii  works as well.  Now that the theory part is over, lets start with the real deal. We'll be spoofing with Hotmail this time. Once you know how to do it, you can spoof with literally any site.  In Telnet,  Connect -> Remote Host   In the  Host Name  field, type in  mx1.hotmail.com . This is the Hotmail mail client that we will use.  In the next box, type in  25 . And select  vt100  or  ascii  in the third one.  Now click  Connect . You will get a message similar to the following:   220 mc9-f25.hotmail.com Microsoft ESMTP MAIL Service, Version: 5.0.2195.6824 ready at  Mon, 24 May 2004 23:52:30 -0700   Now try typing in something and press enter. It will return something like  Unrecognized Command  . Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. The only problem with Telnet is that you can't see what you type in and that there is no Backspace, so you better be careful what you type in. It can be difficult at first, but you quickly get used to it.   NOTE: Never keep the server idle for more than 60 seconds since it Times itself out and automatically disconnects.   Now carefully, type in  Help  and press enter. You will get the following message:   214-This server supports the following commands: 214 HELO EHLO STARTTLS RCPT DATA RSET MAIL QUIT HELP AUTH BDAT VRFY   The first and formost thing you have to do when you log into a server is to introduce yourself. And that is where the  HELO  command comes in.  Type in  HELO [yournamehere] . Example - Helo Murali. The server would respond by saying something like    250 mc9-f29.hotmail.com Hello [202.83.47.991]   This means that the server acknowledges your identity. Now to start the real spoofing.  Type in  mail from: billgates@microsoft.com . The billgates@microsoft.com address I've provided is just an example and you can replace it with absolutely any address such as president@whitehouse.gov or [yournamehere]@cia.gov. The server will display   250 billgates@microsoft.com....Sender OK    Now type in  rcpt to: someone@hotmail.com . This is the name of the recipient and as mentioned earlier, you can only send it to people with their accounts at Hotmail. Try sending it to a friend or maybe yourself. Now, it will diplay   250 maxbarry@hotmail.com   It's now time to put in the data. Type in  Data  and press Enter. The server will acknowledge this and ask you to input in the data.   354 Start mail input; end with [CRLF].[CRLF]   As you cannot see what you're typing in, be careful. Type in   To: Someone's Name  and press enter. If you do not, the mail that the target recieves will contain no address in the "To:" box and it won't look legitimate.  Now type in  Subject: Some Subject  and press enter.  Now you may type in anything you like. After you finish typing in the data, press Enter  twice . And after that put a  fullstop [.]  and press  Enter . This signals to the server that the data input is over. The server acknowledges this again by displaying the following message:   250 [MC9-F4436VSDnxTAxED00042b55@mc9-f4.hotmail.com] Queued mail for delivery   Now you can Disconnect from the Server by typing in  Quit .   There you go, you have successfully spoofed an Email. The same can be done with the yahoo.com server.

       The Hindu  writes:   The Manmohan Singh establishment finds itself saddled with an unusual problem: what to do with the six custom-made BMWs that were bought six months ago by the Vajpayee administration? These are not only bullet-proof but also shock-proof and mine-proof vehicles.   Just in case you are curious. Each car costs more than one crore rupees. But why six? The answer is that India was shining, the foreign exchange reserves were overflowing, and the rulers were in a self-indulgent mood.    As you may know, a newly elected government comprising chefly of the Indian National Congress has taken power in New Delhi.  And this post  strongly   criticizes the BJP Government...  India is a very young nation, only just above fifty years of age, and yet in this short span of fifty years, India has developed beyond comparison. We have stuff that our ancestors couldn't even dream about back them, we have advanced so much, that anyone visiting India after 50 years wouldn't recognize this as India. And we are still advancing.  But even today, more than 20% of India's population, especially in the North Central states are still below the pverty line or/and earn less than $1 [that's almost Rs. 44.8] every day. Now that's really bad, and the politicians of the BJP government knew it. People were suiciding because they couldn't pay off their debts. Lots of people are dying everyday because they are starving. They are also dying because of easily curable diseases and due to the lack of government funding...and yet, the government spend Rs. 6,000,000 on six cars so they can move a mere 500 metres from their residence to their office. That's it -  500 bloody metres , nothing more!! And who the fuck is going to put a mine in the middle of Janpath road anyway??? And all this using the tax paid by the people who are dying everyday, all this using the tax payed by the people who put the government in power, trusting them...No wonder, India opted for a change...

      Well, I recently "discovered"  urlLink  Rum and Monkey   and it looks pretty good. It has a great arsenal of gadgets and tools which they call widgets.    urlLink  The Crappy Little Elf name generator  - Everyone and their dog is an LotR fan nowadays, so these guys came up with an elf name generator. My name is now elfified into  Marehand Faringdon .   urlLink  The Iraqi Leadership Name Generator  - Now, YOU can be notorious (read famous) too. I was Ba'athified into  Muzahim al-Mashhadani  ; then super Ba'athified into  Mustafa al-Tikriti al-Numan ; and later ultra Ba'athified into  Muhammad al-Tikriti al-Mashhadani Hasan ; and finally mega Ba'athified into  Mustafa Abd al-Aziz al-Tikriti al-Mashhadani al-Din Hasan  . Wow, now that's a name....   urlLink  The Goddamn Rock Solid Ghetto Shiznit Name Generator  - Well, my Ghetto name turned out to be  Stim-U-L8 Shizzlemah .   urlLink  The Mormon name Generator  - They're a funny old bunch, those latter day saints. Rather than picking names from their heritage, or the Bible, the Utah Mormons tend to make them up. Sometimes they'll combine the parents' names into one (BenDonna, for example). Other times it's impossible to quite understand what their parents were thinking; names like Zestpool and Zon'tl aren't uncommon. I'm mormonized into  Murlin Kishon .   urlLink  The Insulting Name Generator   - Okay, I was insulted into being  Paraplegickicker Radishballs .  Well, that's it for today fro me...whatever my name is...

           Justice from the Don written by Francis Ford Coppola, novel by Mario Puzo   Bonasera: I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but -- I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken. Her jaw was a'shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life -- beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again. (Bonasera breaks down) Sorry...I -- I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison-- suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "for justice, we must go to Don Corleone." Vito Corleone: We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel, for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you never wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble. Vito Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But uh, now you come to me and you say -- "Don Corleone give me justice." -- But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh...ask me to do murder, for money. Bonasera: I ask you for justice. Vito Corleone: That is not justice; your daughter is still alive. Bonasera: Then they can suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Vito Corleone: (stands, turning his back toward Bonasera) Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had you come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you. Bonasera: Be my friend --(then, after bowing and the Don shrugs)-- Godfather? Vito Corleone: (after Bonasera kisses his hand) Good. Some day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But uh, until that day -- accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.   I know this comes very, very late - The great Marlon Brando, one of the greatest actors of the past half century has died... especially notable for his role in teh Godfather. I dedicate this post to the great man that was Marlon Brando...One fan said: " There are just no actors like him anymore, he is one of the classics. He's like a real man's man, I don't think we'll be able to replace him. "   Truly, one of the greatest, no - THE greatest actor in the last five decades. Adios, Marlon...   urlLink LINK

           How Deep the Rabbit Hole Goes written by Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski   Morpheus: I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice. Tumbling down the rabbit hole? Neo: You could say that. Morpheus: I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo? Neo: No. Morpheus: Why not? Neo: 'Cause I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind -- driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about? Neo: The Matrix? Morpheus: Do you want to know what it is? (Neo nods his head.) Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, or when go to church or when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Neo: What truth? Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. (long pause, sighs) Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. (In his left hand, Morpheus shows a blue pill.) Morpheus: You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. (a red pill is shown in his other hand) You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. (Long pause; Neo begins to reach for the red pill) Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more. (Neo takes the red pill and swallows it with a glass of water)   Well, this is just a "convince the readers that the blog is not dead, yet" post...that's right - It's not dead yet... I was busy, I had my exams, so there's the explanation...  But the real point of this post is to rant about how much the Wachowskys screwed up the Matrix trilogy. Yeah, I know - it's been done a million times, but still, they screwed it up.   Another point to be noted is the sheer genius of the story - no matter how much they screwed it up... the dialogues are pure genius...    And In other news, Matrix 4 : Paybax, has been announced!
