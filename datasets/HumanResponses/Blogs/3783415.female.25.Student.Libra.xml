      My Fellow Classmates- At our meeting on Monday I had asked Matt if I could possibly borrow his formal logic text book.  Since then I have been thinking that perhaps I am not the only one who would like to refresh/relearn/learn the basics of symbolic logic, (most specifically for me Language Q).  I have a few handouts from course work last summer, "Methods of Logic" by Quine and a collection of essays entitled "A Philosophical Companion to First-Order Logic" that I have yet to peruse, but nothing that qualifies as a true text.  Given the nature of formal logic, I feel that briefly going through a text or even comparing notes on internet research would be x-ceedingly beneficial.  Is anyone else interested in meeting as a class to go over logical rules and formats? -Rinn

      Here is the start of what I would like to be an essay focused on Sellars. I thought I would post parts of the essay as I work on it so I can get your responces and help. Since this is only a scrap don't be to surprised if it is rough at points. So without further ado:   Conceptual Holism   The possession of a concept consists in the existence of a node at a particular place in a network of concepts (i.e. a conceptual scheme). A consequence of defining a concept this way is that it commits us to a conceptual holism (in contrast to a conceptual atomism): no person can possess a single concept; concepts only come in sets. Just as a move in chess cannot exist apart from the whole game, there is no concept of red apart from a network of color concepts. Concepts, however, do not consist solely of their relationships in a network. Only the first ingredient is a concept’s unique place in a network. The second and final ingredient is that this particular node in a network belongs to a conceptual network, and a network is only a conceptual network if the network plays a certain role in a person’s form of life. Just as a pawn consists partly in its location in the network “chess”, but also partly in the network chess’ place as a game in our form of life.   To illustrate, imagine a board game where we assign certain English phrases to differently colored pieces: blue for “hello”, red for “good-bye”, etc. Then using the rules of a conversation, e.g. “Game begins with both player putting forth a blue piece,“ we play out a conversation. Perhaps in the game a player can win if they force their opponent into placing the colored piece representing “I’m wrong, your right.” To us this can only partly be a game; knowing what the pieces stood in for we could hardly avoid letting the game also function as a linguistic interaction. But suppose we go on to teach others the game without revealing to them that each colored piece represents an English phrase, or that the rules of the game govern the colored pieces just as the rules of conversation govern the phrases the pieces (covertly) represent. These new players are engaging in the same rules as our language and the blue piece node still holds the same place in the network as “hello,” but playing that piece is no longer saying “hello.” The difference between the original players and the newcomers is in the role that the whole network plays. The statement “hello” only partly consists in its location in the network, the other component is what role the network plays in our form of life and that is what the second group of players is missing which deprives the blue piece of its status as the statement “hello.”  Looking to chess again, we can ask two questions that will have analogous answers for concepts: what makes an action a move in the network chess, and what makes the network that of the game chess? Taking on the former question first: What makes an event a node in a network as opposed to a simple isolated event? For example, a pawn’s location on a chess board can be changed both by making a move in the game of chess or by an accidental bump from a careless passerby. In the first case the response is one that enters a network, is a move in the game chess; in the accident case my response is disconnected from any network.   The difference is that from the in-game move there are further moves now stand in different relations to one another than before the pawn was moved. Certain further moves become “good” moves and will lead to a “win”; certain moves will result in a piece being taken off the board; certain moves will lead me to exclaim “Blast!” while scrunching up my face in anger. In contrast, after bumping the table there are no further changes in the pawn’s location that become “good” moves. Unless, of course, apologizing to the players and putting the piece back where it originally stood is a “good“ move. That, however, puts the pawn’s change in location when the passer-by bumped the table into a different network than the one of chess--the network of manners.    Now we have a move in a network, but what makes my actions a move in chess is only partly the move’s place in the network “chess.” The network must also be a game, and what makes chess a game is the network’s role in our form of life. That there is nothing produced by playing the game, unlike building a house, is part of what makes it a game. Another important part is that in normal cases chess is played for enjoyment, though not in all. If a game was not played for enjoyment in most cases, it would cease to be a game.   Learning Concepts   A concept or a pawn can take on any physical form, and cannot be reduced to any particular physical form. They are roles things can take on, not things. It is how we behave towards the physical cut of wood or the neural pattern that makes it either a pawn or a concept.   There are certain moves from a stimulus to a response that to get from one to the other there must be an inference. When this happens we can say whatever has gone on in the brain during the intervening time between input and output is the physical instantiation of the inference (like a wood piece is the physical instantiation of a pawn). Once said, this statement must immediately be qualified a little since strictly speaking we only mean the stuff happening in the brain that is causally linked to both the input and output.   If a stimulus sets in motion a set of moves from one node to another (perhaps a brain state), and then finally to a response--then it is a conceptual network. Just as the “white bishop” node in chess is both a physical cut of wood and the non-physical “white bishop.” The concept may be shown by science one day to consist of a brain state or perhaps some mental substance or (if we adopt a crude behaviorism) solely a set of behaviors, but this only reduces concepts to their physical form in the way a pawn may be reduced to its physical form. As in chess, concepts need not have the same physical form so long as they function the same in the network and the network as a whole functions the same in the overall form of life.    Simple stimulus-response connections are not concepts, but in acquiring a conceptual scheme a person must first be trained to have certain simple stimulus-response connections. We are, of course, born with a few stimulus-response connections built-in, e.g. crying when hurt, but these must be multiplied if we hope to build a conceptual scheme from them. It is these inborn connections we depend on to train the further stimulus-response connections needed for a conceptual scheme. Since a child has the inborn response to repeat actions that bring about sweet food or an adult’s smile, this can be used to train new stimulus-response connections. (Wittgenstein)  To acquire color concepts a person need respond to different colors with a different response. Let us say that when a child sees red or blue certain neurons in a child’s brain fire. In actual child raising this response does not work because the adult cannot reinforce or show disapproval to this stimulus-response connection. To raise a child the response normally relied upon is verbal utterances, since an adult can hear the child’s utterance and show approval or disapproval depending on if the child has had the right response. Neural activity might be used if we had the proper equipment to know what the child’s neural responses to stimulus were.    Assuming this equipment were available, a child might be shown disapproval for having a certain neural response to blue and shown approval for having a certain neural response to red. Eventually the child will come to have one response only to red items, if not they become classified as mentally retarded; lacking the inborn stimulus-response relations needed for teaching the further stimulus-response connections for a conceptual scheme.  Over time the child might be trained to have different specific neural responses to a set of different colors (e.g. blue, red, and green). This is not yet having the concepts of these colors, but closer to a parrot’s trainability to utter certain words in response to certain stimulus. Concepts arise only when these simple stimulus-response connections become connected to one another into a network. Suppose the child has the neural activity of red when shown a blue tie under intense red lighting, and then we switch to white lighting and the child has the neural activity of blue. If this is the end of the story we are still in the territory of parrots and thermostats, simple stimulus-response connections. If, however, the child is confused because what was once red is now blue, something significant has occurred. In addition to responding to colored objects, the child is confused when objects spontaneously change color. This additional part of the child’s brain that invokes confusion when confronted with spontaneous color changes is one of the needed elements to turn the mere response to a color into a conceptual response. When the response is integrated into a network of elements invoking, e.g., confusion for spontaneous changes, that the child’s responses become more conceptual. Here we might be able to say the child has acquired a set of concepts containing rudimentary versions of colors, objects and causation.   The question might be asked how a neural state can both be a response and a conceptual response; how can a neural state be a concept? A concept is not a physical thing. How can the scientist tell us the concept of redness a pattern of neurons? Surely we would find it much more intuitive if we were told that the concept of red consisted in some mental image of red or some non-physical, platonic “thing” that our mind touches when it contemplates redness. But concepts can be physical in the same way a piece of wood can both be a piece of wood and a pawn depending on its role in a network. A pawn is a certain place in a network of physical things which are at that time taking on the role of the chess network in our form of life.   Still, the cognitive scientist is bound for trouble if they try to identify concepts with neural patterns completely. Part of the problem is that we do not use neural patterns to teach a child concepts, but instead their behavior. A child may sometimes have neural pattern-A when they report “red” and sometimes be in neural state-B, but this is unimportant to if they have the concept of red. In fact, the neural state when the child utters “red” could never repeat itself--always be different. But if the child still responds “red” only to red objects and still can become confused when red objects magically turn blue, then they have the concept of red. Just as having a concept is not a feeling (Wittgenstein), nor is it a neural state.   Think if chess had always been played with a pawn of a certain shaped wood, and now someone  made the claim that a pawn is merely a piece of wood of a certain shape. This is a category mistake, and the same mistake the cognitive scientist makes by identifying a concept with the neural pattern normally (if not always) associated with that concept. Wittgenstein reveals in his Philosophical Investigations that concept possession, language possession, acts of reading, acts of thinking, acts of intending are all further cases where they can only be reduced to neural states in the same sense a pawn can be said to be a piece of shaped wood. Wittgenstein’s main target is those who try to identify these things with a certain feeling, mental image or first-person experience, but his criticism applies equally to the over zealous cognitive scientist. Wittgenstein himself, of course, saw this as well.

      This is a back-and-forth between Mike, Margaret and I that occurred on the Language and Mind web-X forum. I would like to continue the discussion over here and so I'm posting it. As a counterexample to what I am saying in the discussion one might bring into the argument some of what Moore has been claiming about ethics in our text. So without further ado:   Mike -   H.L. Mencken (1880-1956), a literary critic and newspaper writer in America, once said, "Philosophy consists very largely of one philosopher arguing that all other philosophers are jackasses. He usually proves it, and I should add that he also usually proves that he is one himself." I can't help but think of this everytime I wonder what I'm doing when I'm reading what Chuck likes to call, "A bunch of dead white guys." Does anything I'm reading serve a purpose? Oh, but it must. If history is determined by ideas then it is worth my time.   I usually like to balance this quote out with a good one by Stanley Cavell, "I understand it [Philosophy] as a willingness to think not about something other than what ordinary human beings think about, but rather to learn to think undistractedly about things that ordinary human beings cannot help thinking about, or anyway cannot help having occur to them, sometimes in fantasy, sometimes as a flash across a landscape; such things, for example, as whether we can know the world as it is in itself, or whether others really know the nature of one's own experiences, or whether good and bad are relative, or whether we might not now be dreaming that we are awake, or whether modern tyrannies and weapons and spaces and speeds and art are continuous with the past of the human race is not irrelevant to the problems it has brought before itself. Such thoughts are instances of that characteristic human willingness to allow questions for itself which it cannot answer with satisfaction. Cynics about philosophy, and perhaps about humanity, will find questions without answers are empty; dogmatists will claim to have arrived at answers; philosophers after my heart will rather wish to convey the thought that while there may be no satifsying answers to such questions in certain forms, there are, so to speak, directions to answers, ways to think, that are worth the time of your life to discover. (It is a further question for me whether directions of this kind are teachable, in ways suited to what we think of as schools.) [Themes out of school: Effects and causes, Stanley Cavell, University of Chicago Press, 1988. P.9)   Fyfe -    'Isn't Philosophy Great!' or 'The Purpose and Goal of Philosophy'   I am not a cynic about philosophy. Nor do *I think* am I a dogmatist.  I do believe "questions without answers are empty", and that in philosophy you are likely being dogmatic if you "claim to have arrived at answers". But that leaves the possibility that philosophic questions do have answers, just ones not yet obtained. I have always believed "while there may be no satisfying answers to such questions in certain forms, there are, so to speak, directions to answers, ways to think, that are worth the time of your life to discover."   I reject all conclusions, and judge philosophy's progress entirely in the directions to answers it finds and the dogmas of the past it escapes. I dedicate my life to helping philosophy along in this way, fully believing there are answers for a much much later generation of philosophers to strike upon.   This is why I cannot accept ethical nihilism. Because we are too early in philosophy's history to make such a conclusion. Especially when in ethics there are SO MANY unexplored "directions to answers" still left open. When a child realizes the justifications their parents gave to them for ethical rules like "don't lie" are full of holes, they don't immediately turn to an ethical nihilism (or at least that is not the rational move). They begin to think about ethics. (Full stop) Of those kids, the more adventurous ones explore the different theories of ethics available to them in books (sadly, normally in religious books).  In the same way and for the same reason, the state of the child is also the phase all humanity is in. Our generation has rejected the B.S. they have been hand by earlier generations, but it is entirely too soon to conclude ethical nihilism. We, and for many generations after us, must study philosophy and ethics without the expectation of conclusion.   We know how to check, agree upon, prove statements like "Billy is in the chair" but "Billy should be executed" is a queer statement we are only beginning to seriously look for some sort of understanding of.   As far as "living without ethical conclusions", this is quite the problem. However, that is the one I just solved for you. To pursue ethical knowledge is THE ethical thing to do in this situation. A consequentialist ethic with "do the action that contributes the most to the market-place-of-ideas in its pursuit of ethical truth" at the top. You shouldn't steal because you harm the society that must exist to sustain an active market-place-of-ideas. Free speech is societal necessity because the pursuit of any form of knowledge is hindered by limits put on speech--ethical knowledge is no exception. NASA should be given funding because knowledge of the universe, our place in it, etc. seems relevant to our pursuit. So dont complain that you must act today and that this ethics only offers you promissory-notes for ethical guidance, because it absolutely does tell you how to act today. It says, "get a job and contribute to society!" Perhaps not a job on the front lines like in science or philosophy, but one in the support chain like food service or computer science or...    Finally: I agree with Cavell (I think this is his) that questions of philosophy are not questions, they are riddles. The difference is that a riddle is not properly understood until the answer has been given. For example, a King once told a citizen to arrive at his dinner party not dressed but also not naked. When making this command the King did not have in mind any answer to his command, but when the citizen arrived wearing nothing but a fisherman's net, he approved. What the King was really saying (analysis in Ayer's sense of the word) was "Arrive at the party in a way that I will accept as not being dressed but also as not being naked" without himself knowing what he would accept. In the same way "What is it ethical to do?" will, and has, gone through many changes before it will be answered. When I ask that question I don't ask it directly, but as something whose answer will change the sense of the question but I will still accept as an answer. Ethical Nihilism approaches "What is it ethical to do?" head on like a question, but philosophy is a riddle.     Margaret Thomas - Now I know where your faith lies, Fyfe!    Fyfe -   Ethics is the field that tells you what you should do. Since I haven't found any cogent demand from ethics about what I should do, that is what I am studying. One day in my youth I asked "what should I do?" I am still studying philosophy because I never got past that question.   How can you choose be a lawyer or a biologist?!? "Because it interests me." Why does that matter? "Because there is money in it." Why does that matter? I study philosophy because it is the default. Philosophy IS the act of asking "What should I do?" and since I don't think we have an answer to that question, I don't understand how anyone can choose to do anything but philosophy.   I do NOT have faith that there is an answer to the question "what should I do?" I do not have faith that there is an ethics. But it would equally be an act of faith to say there is not an ethics. It is an open question. One that I study because it is rationally the default question. The study of ethics is the rational thing to do when no rational reason can be provided to do anything else, because ethics is the search for a rational reason to do something else.   That is my ethic. With the study of ethics being the highest good. An ethics based on an ignorance of ethics and what I see as the ethics that results from that ignorance.   I don't see faith anywhere in that. Otherwise it wouldn't be my ethic    Margaret Thomas -   Perhaps your faith, Fyfe, lies in the assumption that you should DO ANY THING at all?    Fyfe! -   Ummm... how do I not do anything? I don't see "doing things" as escapable.   Now you could reword your objection by stressing a different word, "Perhaps your faith, Fyfe, lies in the assumption that you SHOULD do anything at all?"   But I am not assuming that I should do anything, that is precisely what I am out to find out.

      So, I'm not exactly sure how the collabrative functions of these things work, but I do believe I have it set up right, so long as everyone accepts the invitations we should be good to go.  How about we (i) each post a message on the main page here, and (ii) try to post a comment to this post, I'll delete them when we all make sure we can do it.  Can post: Matt Rinn Andrew  *i'll edit this as people post **and by 'post a msg on the main page,' I mean, try to make a post similar to this one.  On the frontpage.

      So we have a word, “house”, and we have the things we apply the word “house” to. But what makes an object worth of being called a house? There is no property common to all houses which you can use to say “If x has P, then x is a house.” So what makes a house? And, what tells me when something is a house and when its not?   Consider all the things we might in certain situations point to and say “That’s a house”: (A) A house built in a museum for an exhibit, (B) A family living in a heavily modified abandoned gym, (C) A house built but never lived in…  And the things we don’t call a house: (X) A pile of sticks beavers have assembled to live in, (Y) A family living in an abandoned gym, (Z) A homeless man’s cardboard box…   What could possibly be common to all houses? I think there is a property common to all houses, however only in an extended sense of the word. Here it goes: A house is anything that we will react to by calling it a house. This definition of a house probably depends heavily on the social use of the word “house” more than individual use: One person reacting to a bobcat with “that’s a house” would not make bobcats into houses.  But what if we started using the word “house” to also apply to: (D) chairs. Don’t we want to say there is something natural about the grouping of (A), (B), and (C) under one word and not (A), (B), (C), and (D). That “house” in the first sense labels one abstract thing, and that “house” in the second sense is a conjunction of two abstract things (i.e. houses and chairs).   Following where this feeling leads us, we get dangerously close to an abstract Essentialist Platonism.   So, my able peers, I ask you to ponder what is it that makes (A), (B), and (C) a correct grouping and (A), (B), (C), and (D) an incorrect one. If indeed a house is just whatever we react to by calling a house, than what is wrong with us suddenly reacting to chairs with the word “house” as well?

      Here is a little philosophic argument I’ve had with me since High School:  I contend there exists something external to me. By external I mean things “not dependent for their existence on our minds.” (Soames p. 15) By “me” I mean everything not under the control of my conscious will.   With terms defined this way, all I need to prove an external world is something (anything) not under my conscious will. Since there are many things existing outside of my control; therefore, something, I-know-not-what, exists separate from me.   The most obvious counter argument to this is claiming that the self includes things such as the subconscious, and that things seeming not to be under my control are actually the result of my subconscious and thus actually under my control. Hogwash. I cannot see any promise in the attempt to extend the self beyond the conscious mind. What makes the subconscious special?   Because it is near the parts of our brain that produce our conscious mind? Absurd.    Because it directly inputs into our conscious mind? So do my eyes. So could a computer. Actually I am sure scientists have directly stimulated the conscious mind.   If I hooked up a computer to my conscious mind and feed it images, would the computer be part of “me”? No.   It seems once you extend the self beyond the confines of the conscious mind you are on a slippery-slope to include anything as part of the self. The subconscious is just as an arbitrary thing to make a part of the self as the eye or foot are.   With all this said, it is very philosophically uninteresting. So there is “me” and there is “other” but that is all we can get. When I was a kid I always thought Descartes could know two things with absolute certainty: That he existed, and that something else existed. This, of course, doesn’t get you very far.

      Moore asks us to look at the following list of inconsistent beliefs, and revise the set to be consistent. He is, of course, correct in pointing out that logic only demands that the set be revised and not which particular beliefs be thrown out to do the revision.  (1) All knowledge is thus and so.  (e.g. Nothing counts as knowledge unless you couldn’t be wrong about it in any possible circumstances)  (2) Alleged knowledge of hands, etc., is not thus and so.  (e.g. it would be false if we were brains-in-a-vat and that is a possible circumstance)  (3) I know this is a hand.  So what do you throw out? (1) and (2) together are inconsistent with (3), so one has to go. Moore claims we should throw out the belief we have the least confidence in. Which could hardly be (3). In fact, Moore claims there is no argument we could give that throwing out (3) would be the more sensible move.   How do we feel towards this claim of Moore’s? Has he proven we have two hands? It is certainly appealing… but… something… doesn’t… feel… right….
