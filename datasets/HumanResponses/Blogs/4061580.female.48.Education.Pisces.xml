      Eyes sore from too much Visine and wind from the night window fan.&nbsp; Wishing it was Saturday so I could have the luxury of not working and staying in bed or not. Trying to figure out why children do what they do.&nbsp; Afterall I was one. I was a somewhat on the edge type who tried things early. So now the universal pay back of my own doing the same.&nbsp; hmmm therapy, regulations, bungie cords, locks, military school , Alanon, AAA&nbsp;?&nbsp; Have you seen the movie "Thirteen" or "Virgin Suicides"? Feeling a quandary of guilt and trying to keep myself from letting it merge with my sense of responsibility and reason. The conversation with her early is not communication in any real sense of parenting.  Horoscope tells me to fasten my seat belt.  I have.  &nbsp;

      Ohh I ache today. News from my day care families and neighbors feels bleak. My day care is a micoworld anyway and it feels like there are many crisis arising. Is it universal this darkness?My daughter of 15 came home drunk again at a friends home and we got a call at 12:40 in the am to go pick her up. Another trust issue and sadness between us. All we fear for is her safety and somehow she doesn't see that. She is 15 after all and her reality and reason are very far away from ours. Last week one of my day care moms was driving around lake and a woman walked in front of her and she ran into her killing her. An elderly woman whos husband witnessed it all. An x mayor was he and she a very promenant citizen. I grieve for this woman her life changed forever. Not that I don't have feelings for the family of the dead woman.  I know this woman and what it will do to her life forever. It is sad for all involved. Two women died that day. I got a call on my cell phone yesterday from one of my day care mamas that her husband was in jail for sposal abuse and could her daughter continue to come to my home. Of course. I am a professional and I know how to use the phone to call 911. Such sadness for the children. No wonder her youngest child is aggressively acting out. Another death of the hopeful family. Another call in the evening from another day care mama and her mother in Montana is dying. She would be going soon so could her daughter have more days scheduled. Of course, I have  room because some are on vacations. (thank God) Ironic that I am leaving thursday to go to San Diego to visit my mom and celebrate her 80th birhtday with a family reuinion in Mexico with all the family, friends, cousins and  babies. I feel blessed. Today thsi morning as I was in a store with four of my day care kids getting some copies done for my trip I saw my old neightbor. He looked distraught. He asked the woman behind the counter if he could email something to the newspaper. She told him they were too busy. I saw in feel his face a grayness. He looked shallow and worn out like and old denim shirt. Not the comfortable ones but the ones you throw away. He came to me and showed me a picture of his son. He said he died last night. He died of alcohol poisoning. I can't tell you in words today what that feels like. I feel on the edge of it with the dealings of my own 15 year old daughter who thinks eveyone drinksto binge point. All I can do is sigh a lot all day.I had the boys son in my daycare. What  a smarty he is for his age. He taught my older day care kids to play chess. His father had taught him. Now his father is dead and he will grow up without him as will his grandpa who was my best neighbor. Ironcially he is a recovered alcoholic so how does he deal with that? I am sick. I want to go to bed but yet I must be strong for the little girl who's daddy is in jail for beating her mommy and for my friend who mama is dying and my neighbor who lost his son to his own family disease. phew......the only recourse is prayer, prayer, prayer.
