      Another day goes by without talking to her, another day of loneliness for me... We've met on several occasions today, yet I'm too stupid to take the initiative to talk to her...  We've met on the class corridoor before our test, passing each other without even saying hi... We've met in her class room, yet I saw her sad face, then I backed off... After the class room incident, my pals and I went to the foodcourt to grab some bite. I coincidentaly saw her at the bus stop opposite the foodcourt. Suddenly, I had an urge to rush over to the bus stop, come up with some excuses just to get near her... But being a good friend as I am, I did not leave my pals for her, fearing that my love for her would be exposed to the whole world...  After finding nothing interesting to eat at the foodcourt, one of my friends suggested to go elsewhere to eat. I wasn't listening to him at all, I kept my eyes on the bus stop opposite, trying to catch a glimspe of her as much as possible... When they dragged me out of the foodcourt, with my eyes still peeled on the bus stop, I saw her leaving the bus stop, going towards that god forsaken foodcourt... At that very instant, I felt that it's god's will that we would take seperate paths in our lives. Come on, how could something so drama happen in real life, I wished it didn't, yet it's true...  I got a tip from another pal previously that says that she's pretty pissed up today, so, being a 'concerning' friend, I sent her a message. She replied, I replied, she got angry, I replied, END of messages. Here's the whole content: ME:"Y u today so sad?", HER:"huh got mehz...", ME:"See u today like sooooooo quiet, not like u mah...", SHE:"OH NOTHING LA.. HA", ME:"Ok... Den nvm lor... Relac lah..."  >  Now I feel like a piece of crap once again... After much thoughts, I feel that it's impossible for her to even like me, not even 1%... That's why the topic title today is Give. Up. ... I could only type it, say it, but my heart says otherwise. My heart keeps pumping faster and faster whenever I get within a 10 feet radius from her, my brain keeps generating images of her. WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I DO???!!!

      Sigh~~~ It's been days since I've talk to her, I could only sit deep inside my class,&nbsp;admiring her walking pass my class, sigh~~~&nbsp;I've just been laughed by my so-called "friends". They said that&nbsp;I'm miles away from her, I'm just a normal friend...&nbsp;It's true, but what could I do to improve when I wanna advance yet she retreats?  I'll dream 'bout her everyday without fail, I could&nbsp;picture her cute face inside my mind with a 90% accuracy, the 10% lost to her hair change and her wearing spectacles. You may find it hard to believe, but I actually think that she looks more mature with her specs on, mix it with her cuteness and&nbsp;VIOLA! The prettiest girl I've met!!!   With so much imagination, yet no action. Yes, my pals kept pressing me to give her a call for the intimacy factor, yet I feel&nbsp;so timid whenever I want to&nbsp;push her numbers on the dial... I'm just like a&nbsp;chick, trying to break out of my shell, yet afraid of the harsh facts of lfe, that things do not always go the way you wish... How I wish that my&nbsp;skin's a little thicker, so as to handle the embarressment of rejection. I like to take calculated risks, no, i hate to take risks, which explains why I'm afraid to take risks by calling her...  What topics could I make up if I call her? The lamest advice was to call her for homework advices. Hell, I'm in a freakin' different class with her!!! Yet my friend insist that a little silliness could be of some help, this, I'm not sure of... I seem to have no topics to talk to her, yet her allurence is making me crazy. Why can't I freakin' find a single common interest? Hell, I even have to&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;find out what she likes&nbsp;from her friend... I'm so freakin' useless, I don't even think that she would even give&nbsp;a&nbsp;single thought about a relationship... Friends? I can't handle the truth...   Please, if 'you' know about this, give me a reply, at least reject me for, god's sake. Let me have a little air to breathe, or I'll just choke till death thinking of you yet not getting you...

      I've like this girl way back, like 3 years ago. She was like an angel in my eyes. Been keeping it to myself for so long, think I'm gonna implode if I&nbsp;go on keeping quiet. Now I just wanna let my feelings flow in MY blog. She's so darn cute, even some goddess of beauty could not even compare to her. Hold&nbsp;on a second, she IS my goddess of beauty. She's also darn gregarious, yet I feel like a piece of *ahem* beside her. Why, you ask? My mind goes blank when I'm like 6 feet away from her,&nbsp;could do nothin but&nbsp;to admire her beauty. Like I've stated in my 1st post, I've got a pretty low self esteem, which is killing me now. What's worse, she knows about me liking her and she's beginning to avoid me. How's my feeling now? Depressed and i feel like crap... Did I mention that she was my 1st love? Always 100% in my mind.

      Well, welcome to my very 1st post. What you're gonna read here's basicly about how pathetic my life is, and also my feelings 'bout the world. Let's kick off by introducing myself. I can claim myself a quiet guy, with some sort of low self esteem. Heck, I could even tremble during my oral exams. But if you know me well enough, it's totally different. I'll just keep on yodeling without any sense, like now.

      I did the stupidest thing ever in my life. I did not have faith in her. Remember when I said that I collasped due to fatigue on Sunday? A few moments before I collaspe, I thought to myself that she'd definately not reply, then I actually sent one more message, stating that I could not ride my bike as fatigue had set in, and I'm afraid of having an accident(which is a lie). Little did I know that she had intended to reply to my message earlier, then the last message I'd sent her changed her mind. I knew of this through friend C and T, who helped me without even asking for my opinion. I'm feeling very depressed now. How could I have no faith in her? I should've waited for her message, even if she never intended to reply. Damn it!  I'm depressed because of another reason. I've gotten a C5 for my mother tongue 'o' levels. Crap, should've studied that time...  The past week was my english oral exams, which I went through unscathed, thankfully, except for a few hiccups here and there. What upsets me was that the examiners who were, I thought, lenient with me, was actually sarcarstic towards her the day before. We'd the same examiners, a malay lady and a very cool Scottish, but our exam was on different days. She had it a day before mine. Apparently, the malay lady made pretty sarcarstic remarks about the girl I love. I only got to know this after my exams, if not, I'd have flunked.  The evening after her orals, we chatted briefly online. She said that she could not pass her orals with flying colours, which upsets me as I asked friend C to send her tips the day before. This meant that I had not helped her in any ways. I started consoling her, telling her that she'll do fine. I could not sleep that night even though the next day was my orals. I hit the sack at 11.30pm, but could only sleep at 1.30am. I could not sleep because I was thinking of her, and blaming myself for everything that happened.  Currently, I'm still pretty far from her. I'm actually afraid of her now, I don't even dare to message her last night. I'm afraid of being ignored by her once again. I'm also afraid to face her as I feel that I've dissappointed her twice. 1st was... I've forgotten the 1st case... but the 2nd was when I collasped while waiting for her. I didn't keep to my promise. Now, I feel like I'm a hypocrite myself. She's like an angel, with a halo hovering over her head. She's so near, yet so far away from me...  How I wished I have amnesia, where I could forget everything and start all over again. What I'm afraid of is that I may fall in love with her all over again. How could I resist an angel???

      After much thought today, I've set myself a date to forget her. 9th August 2007. Why 3 years from now? It's because I've loved her for the past 3 years, and looking at how things have turned out, it's better for me to forget rather than salvage. I chose not to salvage as I know that I would make the situation worse.  Many things happened yesterday. I asked friend T to accompany me to Hougang again, but he said that there's no point going there if we do not know which block she stays. I braved myself to message her to ask which block she stays. She said the same things like before, she said that she's not home. Then I replied that I'd be there later in the evening. Then she told me to message her when I'm in the area to see if she's home.  After a while, friend T told me that he don't want to tag along, which made me pissed off. Then I messaged her to tell her that friend T won't be coming along with me, but I'll keep my promise to be there. Then she replied that she would be home very late, even not going home at all. I knew this was an excuse, but I chose to trust her. I sent her a message asking her to give me a message when she reaches home. I knew she won't reply, yet I continued to send another message. I sent her a message stating that I'd wait for her message, even if it'd deprive me of my sleep. But, my darn body could not take the fatigue of the day. I collasped at 1am...  When I woke up this morning, I checked my phone. No messages. I felt sad, of course. It seems like I do not even exist in her eyes... Haizzz... Now, I just want to forget her. Give me 3 years. Maybe I'll forget her cleanly from my mind. What I'm afraid of is that 3 years is not enough for my undying love for her...

      Today began very normally, except that I was late for Fong's optional remedial... The remedial started at 8am, I woke up at 8am, how cool's that. I slept at 3am yesterday, typing the previous blog. I slept with a heavy heart, due to the incident yesterday.  I went to school in home clothes today, slacked through the lesson, and left the geog room. Because after my class was her class' lesson, I got the chance to bump into her, WITH HER SPECS ON!!! Apparently, her contact lens were spoilt during our wild wild wet outing. I was mesmerised by her, but only for a while before she enters the geog room. Then, I went to Funan with friend D to buy Logitech cordless mx duo, which is so damn cool. I now actually enjoy typing more than before, as I can now sit further from the screen in order not to spoil my eyes. Then, I went home by bus 61. On the way home, I thought of her today with her specs on, of how pretty she was with her specs on. Suddenly, I had an biological effect on my *ahem*... After I reached home, I immediately set up the cordless mx duo, and enjoy typing. Then, I went to sleep at around 4pm, until 8pm, then slacked in front of my pc until 1.30am, then I left home for cycling with friend T. We cycled to Hougang, trying to find out where she stays, only to realise that we don't know which block she stays. I had messaged her earlier at home, asking if she had slept, but she did not reply, which really disappoints me. After failing to find where she stays, we went to grab some bite, and then rested at a bus stop to chat. I talked about her, and he talked about his girl. Then, he told me that there's still something else that happened at wild wild wet, which may be my 3rd rejection of that day. He told me that she said something else that day during the slide up partner incident. She apparently threatened to walk out on me if we were to partner each other for the slide up ride. Luckily, I did not hear these words that time, or else I would have left wild wild wet right away.  Of course I felt very upset about her words. I would never have thought that all those words had came from her mouth, but since it had happened, I'm glad that I'm not kept in the dark. Now, I feel that she's a little too harsh on those words, but since she dislikes me, why should I continue pursueing her, knowing that I do not even have a single chance? I can't stop thinking of her, I'm afraid that I would break down anytime soon, and flop my 'O' Levels. How can I just forget the past 3 years? I've been thinking of her since I met her. She could be my morale booster for my 'O' levels. But I should try to wake myself up from these dreams, if not I would really flop my O's.  I'm now pretty sad that things have gone to this stage, a stage where I do not even have a chance in pursueing my one love. What have I done to get this treatment from her? Why is GOD against me? Am I destined to be a failure from start? WHY DID GOD ALLOW ME TO LAY MY EYES ON HER???!!!

      I feel like I'm gonna die anytime soon. I had a great start today, went to school for national day celebration. I was actually looking forward to go to wild wild wet earlier this morning, little did I know that what was gonna happen in the next 12 hours...  After the celebrations, I joined my friends to sabotage our maths teacher as it was her birthday yesterday. After sabotaging, I ran home to get a quick change of clothes, grabbed my slippers and bike, and off I went to meet (friend T) to cycle to Tampines. After 30 mins, we reached (friend M)'s house. All of us had already planned to meet at (friend M)'s house previously as Pasir Ris is just a stone's throw away from Tampines. After getting ourselves acquinted with (friend M)'s mum, (friend T) and me went straight to (friend M)'s room to find (friend C) and (friend L). Then, came a thunderous news. They told (friend T) and me that SHE and (gal C) is tagging along with us. I was shocked initially, refusing to believe their blabbering, but when (friend M) started to get into a phone conversation with the girls, then I started to believe all those craps that they have been spouting for the past 30 mins. After grabbing some lunch at (friend M)'s house, we started to leave for Pasir Ris as we're already late for 30 mins...  We took a cab to Downtown East, managing to persuade the driver to take in 5 of us. Immediately after alighting, we saw SHE and (gal C) walking in the distance. We stopped them, then we went to wild wild wet together. While waiting to pay for our tickets, due to (friend L)'s inability in maths, I gave him $50, and told him to include HER's and mine. I feel liked I'm being exploited. To me, it's not very common that friends give you a treat, and it is a basic manner to at least say a thank you when someone treats you. But, after treating HER today, SHE was so cold, SHE did not even say thank you like SHE did yesterday... Hell... SHE did not even say a thing after I treated HER. Well, I still could take it at that time as I was too indulged in the prospect of entering wild wild wet. After entering wild wild wet, that's when all my nightmare begins...  All of us had lot's of fun playing together, until when we were stnading in line for a paticular ride called 'slide up'... We queued for an hour, with (friend C) and (gal C) giving up the queue, and then the 6 of us continued to queue without them. When it was nearing our turn, we, then dicovered that we haven't choose our partners for the 2-player ride. As all of the guys, somehow, know that I'm in love with HER, they sabotaged me and HER by partnering each other up, leaving only HER for me, and me for HER. This was when my nightmare officially began. HER face turned sad suddenly. I realised that it was because of HER unhappines of our partnering. Then, I went from zero to, well, still zero... I offered to swop partners with (friend T), but he furiously refused, not realising that SHE was getting unhappy about the situation. Then I approach (friend M) to swop partners, who also blatently refused my proposal. After that, thanks to (friend Y)'s realisation of the awkwardness in the atmosphere, (friend Y) suggested that we pick our partners through the finger guessing game of "black or white"... I could see her sense of relieve right after her partner was changed. I went on to partner with (friend L), with a relieved yet heavy heart... Although the ride was pretty adrenaline-pumped, I felt numb while on the ride, feeling as if I could die from the rejection earlier. It was really a psycological rejection, but, anyone with a brain and a pair of eyes could see how sad SHE was previously, and the reason behind the sadness. I'm a totally changed person at wild wild wet right after the ride. Still, I went on to join them with a brave front, but I felt that I could break down any moment.  When we left wild wild wet, we went to a restaurant to grab our dinner as we were already starving. We had a wonderful dinner. Afer the dinner, we went to shop around in Downtown East. I went ahead with (friend M, Y and L) to the arcade while leaving HER with (gal C), (friend C and T). I went ahead because of the incident that happened earlier, but also a little attraction by Initial D. After some Initial D s, we went home. SHE alighted with (friend C) to board their bus home. I needed to go to (friend M)'s house because my bike's still at his place. I accompanied (friend T) to see (gal C) home. On the way home from Tampines, the images of her immediate change of face was still in my mind vividly.  After (friend T) saw (gal C) home, both of us went for a cup of drink to talk some heart-toheart matters before leaving for home. While at the coffee shop, (friend C) called (friend T) to talk about (gal C), but suddenly, (friend T) passed me the phone, told me that (friend C) had something to tell me. In the next few mins, my mind went from normal to blank. (Friend C) told me that while on the bus home with HER, he asked HER how she thought of me. SHE told him that I was ok. But when he asked if I got a chance of getting her, SHE said NO... I would've smashed the phone if it was mine, but thankfully, it's not. I was stunned, but not too surprised as I know that I do not have the criteria SHE was seeking... I had the compulsion of seeking suicide, but I thought it over. I felt that it would not be worthy to die for love, after all, I'm still 16. There's still so much of the world I'd not seen.  I could've gave up on HER long ago, but I chose to continue as I have this unexplainable soft spot for her. I could not bear to see her cry or get hurt, or even get upset. Now, I'm in a dilemma. I don't know if I could get rid of my soft spot for her, forget her to embrace my future, or continue seeking her acknowledgement, until one day when things would go the way that I dreamed it would. Without fail, I'm still thinking of her at this very moment, but with an aching heart...

      Today was one of the best day in my life. Remember I said previously that I'd promised to pass her the burned Jay's cd today? I told myself early in the morning that I must hand it personally to her, and not to pass it to her through someone. I managed to hang on to the cd till 1.50, then, I saw her walking down the corridoor alone. Previously, I was still panicking, I said to myself,:"WHERE IS SHE!!!" I popped into her class, asked (friend M) where was she, then he told me that she went to the foodcourt. When I thought that I would not be able to pass her the cd personally, miraculously, she appeared. I passed the cd to her, she said the cutest "THANK YOU!!!", then she returned to her class, I rushed to my physics lesson...  I've finally got the chance to get closer to her during today's 'cutlet outing'... Actually, it's not 'cutlet outing' anymore, it's more of a 'food gathering' as the bloody owner of the western food stall is bloody slow in preparing food nowadays... Today, I treated her 'chai tow kuay' and drinks, willingly, of course. Just to watch her eat was already a joy, let alone watching her eat for the whole half hour. Because of our tuition, (friend C), (Friend T) and me had to leave, unwillingly for me though.  During tuition, I was thinking about her, every second. Thinking about the way she talked, her actions, the way she ate, hell, almost everything about her.  I took 22 home, just to accompany (friend C), due to the stupid location of his home. But thinking back, I have to thank his father for moving there. When I alighted the bus, to my surprise, I saw her with her friends, waiting for their bus home. This is so bloody coincidental, it's just like my prayers have been answered. I went up to them, said hi, then offered to accompany them while waiting for their buses. She suddenly asked me why didn't I help her write the song titles of Jay's new album for her, I, personally know how corrigable my handwriting was, couldn't possibly destroy, what is, her property is it? Fortunately, I brought the original lyrics to school today for a little reference, little did I know that it was one of the best stupid choices I've made in my life. I offered her to take home my copy. WOOT!!! We waited for around half an hour, with them letting a couple of their home-bound buses go without even responding. Finally, or rather, sadly, they boarded one of their home-bound bus home. Then, while walking home with the friend she held back at the bus stop, I asked him exactly how many buses they purposely missed. His reply was astounding, a whopping 20 buses...  Well, the money spent today had not gone down the drain, luckily. At least now I know that she dislikes egg yolk, which I would definitely take note of it. But if the treating keeps going on, I'll definitely go broke before the end of the month. Let's hope that miracles do happen like today, more frequently.

      My love for her has reignited after what happened yesterday night and today. I would like to personally thank Ah Fong and Jay Chou.  Ah Fong helped me by giving my class a geography test today. Due to the lack of time to study, I panicked last night, wondering who I could turn to for tips. Luckily, I signed in to MSN Messenger, and saw her online. I knew that her class had taken the paper on monday, so I plucked my courage and tried asking her for tips on the test. She gave me tips, which I found out to be very accurate during today's test. I also felt very guilty for not trusting her exactly, as I asked another friend today for extra tips... When I found out that her tips were pin point during today's test, I went into a state of shock. I hated myself on the spot for not trusting her 100%... Damn... I haven't thank her personally today...  I would like to thank Jay because while chatting with her last night, I told her that I was going to get Jay's new album today. She immediately asked me to burn a copy for her, which, of course, I agreed without even flinching. I slept late last night, studying, and partly due to her face appearing every once in a while in my mind, which inadvertently caused me to sleep during Yeow's class and during the geography test today. Luckily I wasn't caught by Yeow, if not, I would not be typing this blog...  I'm glad that I volunteered to help (friend C) to accompany him to see his girl. I went to get Jay's album immediately after school and rushed back to school to meet him. He told me previously that his class would be releasing at 3.30pm, but his english teacher insisted that their class complete their composition before being allowed to leave. To me, a composition may be a child's play, but this may not be the case for others. (Friend C) is one of the others, unfortunately. Due to my passion for english, I offered to accompany them by doing the composition with them. Did I mention that (friend C) is in the same class with her? I slipped into their class somehow to guide (friend C) in his composition. I saw her struggling with her composition too, yet I'm too timid to get close to her. When she finished, (friend C) tried to help me by asking me to double check her work. After reading a few sentence, she came and snatched the paper back. I think it's maybe because of the wrong message I sent her on monday. When everything's almost done, I told her that I'll pass the cd to her tomorrow. Then, she said the cutest "THANK YOU!!!" I've ever heard in my life. These simple words may not affect others, but to me, it was like I struck gold.  Well, tomorrow would be a beautiful day, as I'd be passing her the cd I promised, (friend C) also helped me again today by asking her out for 'cutlet outing' tomorrow. (Friend C) promised to give her a treat tomorrow, but he told me later that I'll be the one doing the treating then... Well, I'll treat her willingly, even if it costs my whole month's pocket money...  I'll share a life philosophy with you guys today,:" never let a woman pay when you are out with them, especially when the one you love is in the group."

      I've got a preety mixed up feeling today. I had some pretty brief talk with her, it's so brief, it took only 5 seconds... 1st talk was after school, at around 1:45pm. While the whole class next door was 'showering' (friend T), I popped in and joined in the fun. When she offered to refill the water bottles, I was still crazily laughing at (friend T)'s plight. When I found out that she had gone refilling the water bottles, I realised that I've missed another opportunity to get close to her one on one, crap... When she returned, she offer her water bottle for me to pour... I was stunned, but I accepted her offer, thankfully... Then, I had to leave for lessons, damn that Fong...  The 2nd meeting was when everything was finished for me in school... I waited with (friend K) in the library for her class to dismiss from Fong's lesson... I've got excuses of my own then, claiming that I was waiting for (friend C) and (friend T) to go for our A-maths tuition. I have, of course, the intention to catch a glimspe of her before leaving for tuition. But those two a**holes screwed up my plan, made me wait for them for a whole 2 hours, and we've got to postpone our lesson till tomorrow. Yet I saw her with her group of friends outside the G room waiting for her friends who were still taking their test. Luckily, I still had (friend K) to accompany me, if not, I'd be the odd one out there... All of you guys reading this blog should know, by now, that I'd feel bloody awkward when I in facing a group of girls, so I decided to leave those two a**holes in their test and go home.  As I'm pretty drained by today's activities, I planned to take the bus home, little did I expect what was waiting for me at the bus stop. When I was approaching the bus stop, I saw a familiar figure at the bus stop. IT WAS HER!!! FINALLY MY CHANCE WAS HERE!!!, but I also saw her friend beside her when I got closer... When I wanted to sit down, that bloody bus, which doesn't appear so readily, appeared at that bloody moment... I can't seem to find an excuse to remain at the bus stop at that split moment, so, without a choice, I boarded the bus. But before I board, I shouted:"bye bye!!!". They replied, of course. But what I did not expect was her to shout an exceptionally loud:" BYE BYE!!!". When I boarded the bus, my heart pumped faster, thinking about the BYE BYE she shouted earlier... Should I be happy? I don't know. I just want to sue SBS for their stupid service... It's the same bloody bus I took wrong the other day while going to (friend C)'s house...

      Yet another day has passed, at least I did some messaging with her last night, WOOT!!! I've got a surge of sense of acheivement today. I cycled from Eunos to Serangoon Garden in 30 mins!!! Before I tried, I thought Serangoon Garden was damn far, but contrary to my expectations, it was only a stone's throw away.  On the way to Serangoon Garden, my friend and I passed by, from what I knew, her estate. I haven't got a pin point location of where she stays, only a vague layout. I was so bloody excited when I passed her estate. My friend suggested me to give her a SMS to indicate that I'm in the vincity and ask which block is she staying, which, of course, I did. I sent a message that says:" me n (Friend T) now at Hougang cycling... U stay wat block?", she replied that she was not at home. Then she replied again asking where are we now. When I received her 2nd message, I was on cloud nine. I was so happy, I almost got into an accident. I replied that we are on our way to (Friend C)'s house, then she stopped replying... It was already enough for me though. I never thought that she would even reply to my 1st message, yet miracles do happen...  Now, this may seem conflicting to what I've said in my previous post, but I believe that I have now at least a 2% chance!!! But hope still remains low for me. Like the incident that happened yesterday at foodcourt, God's message to me was so clear, yet now I choose not to believe in God's will. Will I get divine punishments? I hope I don't, but if I really do get one, I've got a request, punish ME ONLY... Without doubt, I'm still deep in love with her, one and only. I may consider becoming a monk if I am rejected.  One more advice, don't cycle while messaging. Message cycling kills.
