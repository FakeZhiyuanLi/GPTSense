      Sung was a no-show, and I told Lo and Charles not to come due to membership issues. Liang is still gone.  Gary, Shingo, Chow and I started off by doing left-hand layup drills and it went fairly well. However, when we switched to right-side layups, Gary and Shingo started missing a bunch of them. I suspect they were messing around. Team Overland is all about the fun. Then free-throw drill, howevver, was not fun. We took 2 shots each and we would stop when we made 8 consecutive free throws. After a while, we changed that to 4. Then to 3. We never even made 3 in a row, even with Gary in the mix. I hope we don't get fouled in Game 1.  We ran a lot of full court games against a group of aggressive players who weren't very good. We won all of them, but I'm concerned that we only won a couple of them by a couple of points. The offense was a little scattered, but a lot of it was because of they were fouling us and we weren't calling it. I liked Shingo's good post play, whether it was making turn-around jumpers or passing out of the post. We need to make more plays out of Shingo at the low post. One option is for Steven to cut to the middle. Another is for strong side guard to pick for weak side guard, and for the weak side guard to get open on strong side, then Shingo passes out for the 3. Steven and I weren't excecuting the pick and roll the way we're used to because I didn't follow through and dribble more to the right to find him on the roll. Ivan was getting his shots, including a nice 3-pointer from the left baseline. He just needs to work on making most of them. He also needs to make sharper passes, especially when he's at the top of the key. We cannot afford turnovers out beyong the arc, or else it's a breakup layup for the other team. Steven had a strong post-up move where he made a short jumper. I still believe in his post-up play because he's comfortable with his back to the basket. He needs to work on his vision when he spins. If he can see the double team coming, he can make more effective passes to the 3-point shooters or cutters to the basket. I think the whole team should call out the double team coming, especially if it's  your  man that left to help. We need to communicate more effectively, especially on our zone defense, which was less than stellar. Luckily, Shingo showed good rebounding and blocking skills, and with the addition of Lo and Liang, we should have a very solid defensive front court. Because our opponents didn't play zone defense, we haven't had an practice against that yet. So we need to practice it at the shootaround on Sunday. Basically, we'll have a low post and high post forward, just switching around the posts, and 3 guards beyond the arc, swinging the ball around, looking for open 3's or the forwards at the posts. Our number one option is Gary's jumper. Then we look down the post for Shingo. Then it's Steven on the post. The rest of us will concentrate on the open shot, or cutting to the basket. I will try to drive and draw some fouls, but it may be difficult against the zone.  We will find out the time of our game sometime this week, and we'll try to hold a morning shootaround an hour before gametime.

      The plan was to do some drills, but we ended up playing a lot of full court games instead.  At first, we were quite disoriented, but as I started to take control of the point, I felt the structure starting to take place. Ivan was popping to the baseline for open jumpers, and hitting them. Steven was coming to pick at the top of the key, and rolling after the pick. Gary was hitting his 3 point jumpers. The offense didn't move as smoothly when Gary took control of the point, mainly because he needs to be the main scorer, as opposed to setting others up. Also, his bad knee didn't allow him to drive in. I am hoping Sung will be a solid point, but we'll wait and see. Lo's friend, Charles, was not bad. He showed good perimeter shooting as well as hustle. We should consider having him playing game 1 with us, since Liang won't be here. I noticed Ivan could hit the shots off one dribble in addition to the spot up shot. Now, he can fake the first spot up shot, dribble once to the right, then shoot the j. One thing Shingo can work on is the pass out. Get the knees bent, elbows out, pivot, then pass to the outside guard. He was getting those passes deflected by the 6'5" player. He should try to create some separation first. On the half court game though, his turn around against shorter players is deadly. We should try to get him that shot as often as possible. We can send a guard to pick for him, make them switch defenders so he gets a shorter man on him, and either make the turn around j or draw the double and pass out to open shooter. Steven should still try to get more work in on the 1-on-1 post up moves. It will help create a lot of open shots if he can draw the double off it.  The season starts Sunday, June 13th, so we only have 1 more Sunday practice until then.
