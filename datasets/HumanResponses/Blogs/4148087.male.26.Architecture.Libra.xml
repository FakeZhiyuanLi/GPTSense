      Boomtown posted some new screens of Monolith Studio's upcoming shooter  urlLink F.E.A.R. .  I've been a fan of Monolith for a bit now, mainly because of their No One Lives Forever games, and this one looks like a much more serious game than what these guys have been putting out.  It looks amazing graphically, and the story definitely has promise.  I'm gonna be watching this one fairly close.  -Ruiner

      Hmm... slow day I guess.  Getting into Star Wars Galaxies with a few folks.  I can see how it could be very very time consuming.  However it makes me want to get World of Warcraft all the more.  I'm so damn eager to get into that game and really build up a character who can woop some ass.  Just not sure if i can get into SWG as much though.  Now if this trial were for the new Jump to Lightspeed expantion... then I might be able to.  The idea of merging a space sim game with a land based MMORPG is killer in my mind.  We'll just have to see.   Game on!  -Ruiner

      Looks like my first set of full season tickets may just pay off!  As most of you know, I'm a hockey fan, and this year for the first time, will have full season tickets to the Phoenix Coyotes.  Now... granted they sucked the big one last year, but the wife and I just love goin to the games none the less.  However, Phx. GM Barnett and his crew have been hard at work this off season to try and rebuild from the ruins of last season.  They have resigned most of their primary talent and aquired some solid fresh meat.  But todays news is the best of all!  The release went out today that Brett Hull has signed a 2 year deal with the Coyotes.  He will be coming from my team, Detroit, and will hopefully bring some vetran blood to this shaky team.  I cant wait for the first season ticket holders meet and greet!  Gots stuff to get signed now!  Very cool news!  urlLink YESSS!   -Ruiner

      NVIDIA announced today that the new  urlLink GeForce 6  series will be shown and QuakeCon later this week.  I am eager to see if NVIDIA can pull themselves fully out of the rut they drove into with the NV30 cards.  Their current run of cards is doing very well with the recent release of Doom 3, but will it hold up in Half-Life 2?

      If you are a fan of RTS games, or a fan of Lord of the Rings, you owe it to yourself to check out these videos for the upcoming RTS Lord of the Rings - Battle for Middle Earth. The last LOTR RTS was total and complete crap if ya ask me, but this looks like it could really change the genre. Check it out...   urlLink WORTHPLAYING.com   -Ruiner

      Why yes...  I'm sure just about all of us are playing Doom at this point. Whether you bought it or downloaded it, we are all playin it. Frankly I love it. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from it. I played the old Doom games and thought they were cool enough, but I didn't think they were amazing. The repeating maps and constant mazes of crap left me a bit bored... but I had fun gunning down all the baddies that's for sure. I'm more of a Duke Nukem kinda guy I guess. It just felt like Duke was more fun.. more entertaining. There just seemed to be more imagination and creativity in it. Not to mention it was oh so very tongue-in-cheek. Doom just tried to take itself too seriously. So when I was watching all the press on Doom 3, I was only looking at the visual quality.  Being a 3D geek of sorts, I was getting a kick out of all the new lighting and texturing techniques that Carmack and his boys were implementing, but everything just looked TOO dark.. if there is such a thing in a horror game. But once I loaded it up, I was blown away.. the overall look and feel is amazing. Its completely different than what I felt it was going to be from the screenshots... Don't judge a book by its cover I guess. The game is great and I'm loving playing it.  Story.. hmm.. did the original Doom have a story? Some Doom lovers say yes, it had a deep story. Well from my recollection the story was about the same as Half Life... scientists open a portal to somewhere and bad shit comes through.. its your job to stem the tide of baddies and win the day. Not a big deal really because even Carmack is quoted as saying that in the Doom games, story comes last. That's just the type of game they are, so I'm not complaining about Doom 3 lacking much of a story. I do love the extra work that id went through to make this game stand out. I love the PDA, and love all the stuff that comes along with it. The emails are damn cool, and the website tie-ins make it all the better! Then there is the computer screens in game. This was one of the first things that made me go YESSSS when I started playing it. The fact that they aren't 2 state maps that are either o or off.... they are animated and have several usable buttons on them... That's just a great touch. Kudos id.. Subtleties make all the difference.  I fell I'm not THAT far from the last parts of the game and its a bit sad really. I was hoping that the game would be a bit longer... ahh well. I've put in probably about 10-15 hours so far.. not more than that for sure. Things do pick up once you are in Delta Labs, and I cant wait to see what I run into next!  Ill have some various screenshots up later this weekend. I've been taking them as I go along when cool stuff happens and ill throw some NON-spoilers up later today possibly.  Hopefully ill get to try the co-op mod later tonight as well with a few guys.. man that would ROCK!  Until then...  -Ruiner

      That's right ladies (not likely) and gentlemen (also not likely)... I'm back.  Why do I feel like I'm talking to myself right now?  Maybe because nobody will read this... ahh well.  I thought id jump on this whole Blog craze bandwagon.  Its easier to update than a website too, and I can add pictures to it.    I don't have much to say at the moment, but ill be posting more later.  Feel free to bookmark me or just say "screw you yet again Ruiner!"  Its up to you.
