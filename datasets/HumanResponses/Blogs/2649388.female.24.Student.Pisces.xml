      Last nite, as usual, I was sitting in front my computer, doing my own things (u know ... chatting on ICQ, playing mp3, SSH-ing into my school account pretending to do research work, reading a paper on PDF but never gone over more than 2 pages, checking out random stranger's blog, playing solitaire ... etc etc), then an ICQ message popped up, from an account that I don't recognize (Let's call him "Mystery Man" for now).  Mystery Man: "u there???" (I paused, thinking hard, trying to figure out who this is ... he sounded like he knows me.  So I responded, with hesitation ...)  Me: "Hey ... who is this?" Mystery Man: "David Lin..."   (err .. ok. THAT did not help much ... so I took a wild guess.)  Me: "from Helicomm?"  (David from Helicomm, DON'T laugh when you see this blog. I swear, at that time, I did NOT remember your last name ... and u know, I thought u were the ONLY David that I know whom I  keep in touch with =P)  "no...  r u in Boston???"   (Gosh WHO IS THIS GUY??? He knows me! I was a bit freaked at this point, and I seriously didn't think I knew him.)  "err .. yeah ... I m so so so so sorry.  Have we met?"  (Being a bit freaked out, I still kept my manner under relative control.)  "urrr....  how about this: Christmas Party...."  Oh My God ... So I DO know him after all. *awkward* I felt sooo stupid/embarrassed at that moment.  He is my mom's co-worker's son (yeah, long chain), and I see him basically once a year, at my mom's boss' Xmas party.  This year, we happened to sit at the same table, next to each other, so we chatted.  U know, the usual *social* conversation ... he asked me how's Boston and how I like MIT; in response, I asked how's work, and then somehow the topic got into the bad economy and the out-sourcing problem among engineering jobs ...  Then at the end of the party, he asked for my contact info.  With my dear mother on the side, I didn't want to be rude, so I gave it to him.    During Xmas eve, he actually called, and left a message saying "Merry Christmas" (I didn't pick up.) So I was like, ok .. that's very nice of him.  Merry Christmas to u too. Knowing that he called, my dear mother started to nag at me, about how I should call back because it would be rude if I don't, and that he is her friend's son ... yada yada yada.  To get my mother off my back, I told her that I would call back and say happy new year on New Year's Eve.   Well ... I didn't call (suffering from temporary amnesia).  What do you know, after New Year is over, my mom actually remembered -- She specifically asked if I called back.  Err ......................... NO.    Of course, my honesty earned me nothing but another lecture.   O.K.  So I promise, I will email him *sometime* in the future when I get back to Boston.   Well ... obviously, I haven't yet (my temporary amnesia is acting up again).  I have completely forgotten about what I promised to my mother ... Furthermore, my promise is not the only thing that I forgot, I also forgot his name and the fact that I gave him my ICQ. =P  That was my little awkward moment of the day. I added him into my ICQ list, as "mom's friend's son" ... so hopefully I will remember him next time if he ever pops up again.

       UCSD Job Fair  Yesterday, UCSD had its usual fall quarter job fair .. (yes, I still keep track of events happening in UCSD).  My dear boy friend decided to take a 2-hour lunch break and go "check out" the job fair.  No, he wasn't there to look for a job.  And no, he didn't go as one of their company's recruiter ...   I remember during the time, I was hiding-in in the lab, away from the freezing wind chill, with space heater right next to me, and sipping hot chocolate.  Then his ICQ message popped up.    "Hey, I am gonna go to UCSD job fair."  "Really?  As Websense (the company he works for) representative?" "No ... I just want to get some toys ..." "... ..."  O.K. So he went solely because of the toys.     2 hrs later, he came back, and start grumbling about how he only got two pens and there were no good toys ...  I guess guys will always have a child-like heart, no matter how old they get.    My roommate's Beta fish  My roommate's little beta is not eating.  Obviously, he is not doing so well under this cold weather and is losing his appetite.  According to my roommate, beta fish would be the happiest, living under water between 75&deg F ~ 80&deg F.  If you check weather.com, you would know that right now Cambridge is no where near 75&deg F (in fact, it's -9&deg F).  So we decided to move the fish to the kitchen, right next to the stove, and hope that he will do better there ... Nope.  That didn't work either.  Last night before I went to sleep, I checked on him ... His food was still floating at the surface of the water, and he was still not eating.  Hum ...  Today my roommate decided to move the fish again.  Now he is right next to the space heater ... We were kinda concerned before, worried that the space heater might be too hot for the fish, but I guess my roommate eventually decided that, she rather has her fish boiled than chilled to death.  =/  ... Good luck, little beta.  I hope you will do better soon.    Cold Cold Cambridge  Weather.com says that the temperature is -9&deg F right now, and still dropping.  With the wind factor, it "feels" like -25&deg F.  Great.    I have been getting a lot of concerning ICQ messages from my friends in California ...  The first thing they say is always: "I heard that it's really cold in Boston right now ..."   Eh, yeah, you got that right.  On TV, CNN was showing news about people doing egg test along side of the road (you crack an egg open and see how long it takes to freeze).   It can freeze under 20 mins.  (NO, Bryan, I am NOT going to try it myself.)  As I was standing in the cold wind at 7pm in the evening, waiting for school shuttle, I was seriously worried about freezing my toes off ...   I miss California. *sob*

      Being a newbie of writing blogs, I realize that it's hard for me to shut up since no one tells me to. So here it goes:  Today me and my roommate went shopping.  Not like happy shopping, shopping for clothing or accessories.  We went shopping for food and home supplies.    Our first stop is Costco -- I bought food, contact solution, ... and I almost got a 48-pack peanuts M&M's (I love peanuts M&M's ... those are yummy, but I decided to watch my weight).  After shopping in Costco, my friend Jamie and his roommate decided to eat hot dogs from Costco.  So they were there eating, and I was extrememly tempted ... but I told myself: "Must resist ..." the reason being, those hot dogs are made with beef, and I was still a bit freaked out by the Mad Cow disease ... (ok, so I was being over-paranoid).  The resistence didn't last long, I shortly gave in to the "peer pressure" and ate the beefy hot dog -- this is the first time I ever had beef since the mad cow disease incidence.  (Yeah, if there are holes starting to appear in my brain after 20 years, I am gonna come back and sue those 3 =P) Anyhow ... the hot dog was actually pretty good ... I enjoyed it quite a lot.  Then we move onto Target ... I bought a blanket (My room is freezing due to the drafty windows) and some of those "peel and stick" hooks that stick to the wall so I can hang stuff up in the kitchen.  My roommate and I wanted to reorganize our kitchen because w/ those new cooking tools that we brought back from CA, our kitchen is running out of cabinet space.    Finally, my roommate went to PetSmart -- she has been wanting a beta fish for a long time.  I never liked fish -- they freak me out.  My phobia towards fish goes a long way back since Junior high ... it's a long story; anyway, the point is, I am not too fond of fish personally.  But the one that my roommate got is actually *cute*.  It's ruby-red, and lazy as hell.  My roommate settled him in a little fish tank, and he just sits there ... after 10 mins, I swear he is still at the very same position ... not even wabo-ing that much. =/ My roommate says it's relaxing watching her fish being in the tank ... I guess she is right.  After all, that fish is so lazy.    So PetSmart was our last stop, and I am pretty happy about the shopping today -- our kitchen is re-organized so that there is more counter space, and now I am all bundled up in my blanket, warm, fuzzy, drinking hot tea and blogging.  *smile happily* =)

      Ok ... so I got one complain yesterday from a friend, saying that I *complain* too much.  Well ... Excuse me if I complain too much.  (BTW, that is the whole point of this blog -- I can blab out all my complains/bitterness without getting people annoyed.  If you are interested, read it; if you are not interested, don't check this site; if you did check and get annoyed, tell you what you can do -- did you see a little "x" on the top right hand corner of your browser?  Yeah -- click on that, then I will be out of your face immediately.)  Besides, complaining is good -- it does your mind good like milk does your body good.  It's a healthy outlet for your bad/bitter/negative/sad emotions.  Therefore, my friends, bravo to anyone who is healthy enough to complain -- but don't complain to me, get your own blog to complain away!

      I finally got myself a blog (yay go me!). ok ... so it does not have the prettiest layout/background color, and it does not have any brilliant writing or deep thinking  (or lame, one might say) like "what's the meanign of life", but it's *my blog*.  A place for me to blab/complain/moan about my very pathetic life in the east cost.  For those of you who are being considered as my close friends -- congratulations!  You no longer need to hear my complains 24/7.  I will just blab it out here, and you can check it out at you own time, at your own convenience.  For those of you who are equally important but who I did not have time to social with during busy school time -- good news!  If you are really that curious/bored/have nothing else better to do with your own life, look over here.  You can get constantly updated news about me, about east cost, and about how much it sucks over here (refering to the weather, the school, my tiny little room which can never get heated enough, and my tiny little kitchen which runs out of counter space with just one microwave and one rice cooker ... yeah you get the picture).

      Ok ... I did NOT abandon this blog (I swear).  It's just that ... school finally kicked in.  There had been times when I was just like "ah ... I am going to blog about this"; then I ended up procrastinate, and the blogging time window kinda just "expired".    Anyway, this week was disastrous, especially Monday was the worst.   This is what happened:     Monday   10-11:30  Class -- Theory of Parallel Hardware; talked about semisystolic network and systolic network, transformation from one to another, retiming of the circuits ... etc., went over related Lemma, Theorem, and Corollary ... and I walked out of the lecture being more confused than ever.   11:30-12:40 Grabbed quick lunch, ate, checked email, went back to the lecture notes from this morning and tried to re-digest the material, and learned that, I learned absolutely nothing this morning.  12:40-2:30 Headed over to another class -- Computer System Architecture.  We went over 5-stage pipeline for MIPS architecture and different types of hazards (structural, data, control).  It was a good review for me -- thanks to Dean Tullsen, I think I actually learned architecture well in my undergrad class.  2:30-3:00 Headed back to lab, grabbed coffee and gulped it down.  Checked some more email.  3:00-5:30 LONG meeting for my research.  5:30-8:00 Study group for my Theory of Parallel Hardware class.  We have problem set due every Wednesday. Trying to figure out how to divide a N-bit number by 3 in O(logN) time using O(N) hardware is not exactly a fun thing to do.  8:00-9:30 Had a nice dinner in Bertucci's with labmates  9:30- Trying to do the problem set Got really dizzy and nauseous Threw up twice Decided that doing problem set while being nauseous is not exact a smart thing to do, bed. Slept while having stomachache.    Tuesday  I woke up, still not feeling well, so I decided to go to the MIT Medical center. Honestly it wasn't very helpful. The female doctor said that I have stomach flu (duh), and told me that I should:  1. Go home, lie in bed, and sleep more. 2. Eat something light, such as miso soup.  Ok ... let me get this straight. I have problem set due the next day, for which I haven't figured out the answers.  I have a paper reading meeting on Thursday, for which I haven't read the paper yet.  I have a quiz on Friday, for which I haven't had time to finish the practice problem sets.  Sleep more?  I don't think so.  Furthermore, miso soup??  What the ... Do I look Japanese to you?!  (I don't even know where I can get miso soup paste.)  So the trip to the Medical center didn't help too much, except that I learned:  1. I have stomach flu. 2. There is no medication for it. 3. To cure myself, I should do mission impossible #1 and #2. =/  After the medical center, I again headed back to the lab, for my study group for the Theory of Parallel Hardware class.  This time we were stuck on the problem of "how to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph G with N nodes in O(logN) time using NxN mesh network".  Throughout the entire discussion, I was just sitting there, feeling nauseous and dizzy, praying for this whole thing to end as quickly as possible.  Obviously at that point, my brain wasn't functioning anymore.  (Thank God I have smart classmates.  Of course, I feel stupid in front of them from time to time, but that's beside the point).    Wednesday   More Theory of Parallel Hardware, learned that there are more things that I just don't understand. More Architecture, which is not too bad. Trying to finish my practice problems for the architecture quiz. Still bad headache due to the stupid stomach flu. Have been vegetarian and cut out diary from my diet since I threw up.    Thursday   Uneventful.  Had two meetings since 10 in the morning, stayed in the lab for the rest of the day, studying for my architecture quiz the next day. Bill Gate came to MIT campus to give a talk.  I got the ticket for it, but of course, I ended up missing it.  Because I eventually decided that, my quiz is far more important than going to listen to the richest man in the world talk.     Friday  Quiz. Architecture is the one class that I thought I could handle well.  Ok, maybe I was wrong.

      Ok ... Many people think that I got bored of blogging and abandoned my blog. Let me officially announce it here: "NO ... NOT ... YET" (wait till school work gets intense)  I don't know why I didn't blog for awhile ... I guess I didn't find things that worth blogging for a page.  There were little things here and there that I could talk about ... so now I am writing them all at once, as a "weekly digest".    Ice Skating  I went ice skating with my roommate a week ago ... in MIT ice arena. For a long time, I refused to go skating under any circumstance, because I had a BAD experience with roller skating when I was in elementary school (my mom forced me to learn roller skating, which did not turn out well ... you see, many phobias developed in adulthood actually rooted from traumatic experience in childhood ...)  I just didn't like skating, and ice skating, of course, falls under the same category. I didn't know what came into me that day; my roommate said that she wants to go ice skating, and I decided to tag along. (Before I went, my boyfriend seriously warned me about the *danger* of skating -- from his first and last skating experience, he almost broke his arm and had to drive w/ his left hand for a month).  Somehow, that day, I just all the sudden felt ... fearless. You are probably thinking, that's a disaster waiting to happen, considering that I had never learned how to ice skate before.   Well ... it actually turned out to be a very NICE experience.  During the two-hour duration, I learned how to ice skate, though I can't quite do it as smoothly as I want it to be yet ... but I did have a lot of fun. For sure, I will go back to the ice arena, again and again, until I master my skating skills ... (ok, maybe not, maybe just to be able to skate smoothly without tripping).  Hehe ... and by that time, I plan to drag my boy friend to go ice skating with me (I sense a strong resistance) ... *evil smile*.    My roommate's Beta Fish  After posting the last blog about my roommate's Beta fish, I got a lot of concerning messages from friends/sister about the fish.   I thank you for all your concerns, and I have a good news: the Beta fish is still alive, and well.   It turned out that, this Beta fish *actually* likes cold water (my roommate called up the pet store and asked).   We had no idea why the fish doesn't eat very often ... we think the fish is on diet. =/ Well ... since it's alive and well, I guess there is no need to over-concern ourselves.  (Yeah, we were over-reacting all this time.)    Trip to California, my melancholy  This past weekend is me and my boyfriend's 5th year anniversary. =D So I decided to sneak back to San Diego, CA for one last time before IAP is over, and celebrate. (Sneak back as if ... my parents weren't aware of it).  What can I say ... San Diego is nice, as always.  60&deg;F, sunny and warm ... makes me want to cry.  I also re-visited UCSD, got to talk to some old friends and profs back home ...   On the day of anniversary, we went to a movie that I wanted to watch for a long time (even though it didn't get a good review), and we both liked it.  We took a walk in the afternoon, to the coffee shop near his apartment, enjoying the weather, sipping coffee, chatting about his work, my school work, our future plans, life in general.  At nite, we went to a fancy restaurant in downtown La Jolla, had full-course meal, and shared a dessert together -- chocolate fudge w/ fruits, nuts, and Macadamia ice cream on top. *yum*  The whole weekend was nice, and time just flew by in the blink of an eye.   I don't want to admit this, but I really do miss CA, miss San Diego.  All the sudden I am confused.  I didn't realize how much I was attached, whether towards my old life style, towards my boyfriend, or towards San Diego.  I didn't know I would miss spending time with him, or miss living in San Diego that much ... not until I have lost the opportunities.  I guess that's just human nature ... the weekend that we spent together doing *common things* that usual couples do makes me happy, even though I used to not consider those moments any special when I was in SD.

      This is a post that I wrote awhile ago, but didn't publish in time because I never actually took time to complete the entry.  I eventually decided to post it without much editing, so you get to peek into my unguarded/heedless thoughts --   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Ok ... I guess I haven't blogged for a LONG time, and I probably should post something, just so that people won't think that, I have completely abandonded the site and stop visiting ... Not that it matters anyway.    I am not sure what I want to write.  Honestly, I m posting simply because I got bored of waiting for gcc to compile (compile as if, compiling gcc itself ... configure, make bootstrap, make, make install...)  Somehow time flies by when you are busy. Spring is finallly here.  (At one point, I thought that Spring forgot to visit Cambridge ...)  Time is counting down.  All the sudden, I realized that, I have been in MIT for almost a year.  Thinking back in time, when I first stepped into this campus, I was full of doubt and wondering about the uncertainties in life.  Now a year has passed, and it seems like nothing has changed at all.  Ok.  Maybe one thing has changed -- I used to think that, all these doubts are just a side-effect of the transition phase and that they will eventually go away as time passes.  Now, I am not even so sure about that anymore ...

      My grandma passes away 05/11/04 10pm in China.  I wanted to write something, but I couldn't.  I kept on erasing stuffs that I typed, because ... somehow, nothing seems to fit.  She loved me ... and now it's too late .... too late for me to do anything about it ....  I should have visited her in China last summer.   I didn't.   I hate myself for that.

      Didn't sleep all nite long ... now I have a stupid headache. Walked into the lab before 10 a.m., I am the first one here. Still got tons of stuff to finish before tomorrow's one-on-one meeting ........... *moan*  James was so nice; he made breakfast ... two eggs w/ apple and orange juice.  I think I haven't been this healthy for a *long* time ... well, except for the non-sleeping part.  It was nice to have someone there, when you were ready to face the morning alone. I owe him a big one.

      I decided to blog since I am still waiting for the stupid gcj (gnu compiler for Java) to compile ...  So now that summer comes, my social life is actually getting better. Many of my regular hang-outs left campus, for vacation, interns ... etc. First I thought it would be a long lonely summer, w/ me myself being in Cambridge. A bit surprisingly, it turns out that, I met some new people outside of CS (hurray!), and I have been having a lot of fun hanging out with them during the past week.    These people are guys from Taiwan.  They are just so ... Hum ... let me think, how I should put it ... they are just sooo "taiwanese".  Most of my close friends that I have made throughout college are people who either grew up in the U.S., or came from differnt countries other than Taiwan.  Unlike all my other friends that I have made during the past ... well, 8 years living in U.S., they grew up in Taiwan and they remember/absolutely love everything about Taiwan.  We can talk for hours about things like Taiwanese books, Taiwanes Authors, popular Japanses soap that people watch ... it is really awesome.    On the side note ... They have also become my source of Chinese books ... they brought some pretty cool books from Taiwan, which I can't wait to get my hands on them! *excited*  (I told James not to lend them to me yet, otherwise, forget about research and sleep ... I will just read them non-stop ...)

      My roommate is leaving for her summer training camp today.  Apperantly she needed to get up really early and get to the airport by 5:30 a.m.  She was up by 4:20 a.m., and went into the bathroom.  I, on the other hand, was just wrapping up my work and about to go take a shower before diving into bed ...  I walked out of my room, and realized, she was using the bathroom. WOW.  Living together for almost a year together, this is the first time ever, we had a conflict using bathroom. (She is a morning person; I am a night person.  We use bathroom during different time of the day).  So there you go.  Since I can't shower (and therefore can't go to bed) yet, I am blogging, at 4:30 in the morning.    I never realize, how messed up my sleeping schedule is.  My roommate saw me when she walked out of the bathroom, and said, "What r u doing?? It's summer! You should go to bed early!" -- Sounds like my parents; I know she cares. =)  ... On the bright side, I get to say good-bye to her again before she takes off.

      So I finally edited my profile and set up my blog to have a comment section (something I meant to do for awhile but always ended up procrastinating).  Now people can post comments ... thou I am not sure how many people will actually do so.  Haven't been in good mood for a long awhile ... Don't ask me why.  I haven't quite figured it out myself yet. (not like I will publicly blog about it once I figure it out anyway)  Just got back from the family trip to Canada.  Loved Montreal and Quebec, but again, too lazy to blog about it ... maybe I will blog about it later, or maybe not.  Maybe the topic will just sit there until the time window expires ... like everything else that I wanted to blog about and ended up not to.  Sometimes I wonder, what's the point of blogging, if it's so public and everyone else can read it (whether you like it or not).  Everytime before I write something, I have to pause and think: do I really want this to be publicly discussed?  Maybe I will start another private blog ... or maybe I will just keep a private diary of my own ... or maybe, again, I will be too lazy/busy and ended up not doing anything about it.  I should stop ranting.
