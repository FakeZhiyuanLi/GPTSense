      "does it ever occur to you, when you put your trust in someone that they are going to completely break it? how many broken promises does it take for one to realize it isnt worth it? or...to stop putting trust in them? when you're a push over, and when you're a very trusting person, you're munipulated easily. some munipulated in things like..drugs..sex..etc..others, its just being human and trying to be able to give your heart and feelings to another human. is that so wrong? it shouldn't be. like other issues..why should racism be one? can people not just realize we're all people? we're all here to live and die. so it should be natural that we all get along. it should be natural to be able to trust another without worry. too bad life isnt like that." I didn't write this but holy shit did it ever effect me . I had no idea the person who wrote this felt this way. I can definetly say that i have a new appreciation of this person. Thanks for your moving words and constant support.

       I'm making the biggest effort i can to come here and write once a day. BUt to do this you can't really expect everyday to be as good as the days before it.lol! Well i may not interest some people with what i write but i do hellp myself. By writing everyday, i can clear my head and better yet, this journal will never be stolen or peaked at by annoying younger siblings, though it is being viewed by thousands of people from across the world.[ Its possible!]      Today is not but over yet so why rite about it already. dont worry though i  promise ill have something for you tommorow[i can see it now.........lol maybe not yet]

      This is a question that i have often asked myself. Imean does it rele affect me in any way shape or form . YYYYAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!! duh, of course it does. its all about my heritage, and my life. i no u've probably heard this about 10000000000 times but rele if u dont understand the whole point of canada day its probably not going to make much sense to u will it . sure ull see the fire works and the fairs and all that CRAP, but is that rele wat canada day is about? Of course not . its about u and me and every other canadian living or dead and wat they did to help this country. i guess im just trying to say that ppl should appreciate the actual point of this holiday and not just look forward to the fireworks, activities and the day of work. thanks to every one for making canada a wonderful place to live. HAPPY 137th BIRTHDAY CANADA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
