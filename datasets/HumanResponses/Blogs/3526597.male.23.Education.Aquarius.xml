       because...I'm one of them!  Example. There was a box of croissants laid out in my kitchen this morning. Man they smelled really good. I grabbed all of my stuff to head out for the day - backpack; documents; coffee cup, and basketball shoes. So my hands are full. But I still wanted a croissant. So what do I do? I put one in my front breast pocket! Hahaha. It was funny cause it didn't fit in the pocket. It kind of just hung half way out. Fucking great. I got into my car and enjoyed it.

       Ok, this is me venting about working for a large prestigous corporation.  There's nothing worse than that dreaded feeling of waking up every morning to attend to a job that I hate. The alarm goes off at 600AM. I wake up have not one iota of motivation to get dressed and ready for work. I mean, who does? Who the hell  wants  to? Well, there's the CEO, the CFO, and then there are the lieutenants who want to be CEO's and CFO's. Ah, but not me.  When was the last time you guys had a vacation? It could be anyplace: somewhere with nice beaches, or a lake, or even a camping trip, or a foreign city, or even an old historical building or site. How did it feel to get away from everything? To leave work behind, to forget about the bills for awhile, to forget about kissing up to people that you don't know but are in the same proximity with because they have bills to pay also. I was in Japan not too long ago. And later on in Hawaii. Personally, it was amazing to me. To wake up and not worry about a million things to do but instead worry about maybe 3 things at a time. Where to eat, what to wear, where I'd like to walk today, etc. To wake up and look forward to living, and not worry about working and slaving away. To greet the sun and take it for free as if it were, which is it but which we rarely get to enjoy. To take in every breath as if it were my own - and my own only. To stand in a place of my own chosing. To take a walk of my own path. To take a piss without looking at a clock. To eat a meal without being interrupted because of a work issue which forces me to leave my meal to attend to the issue to show comraderie to a familiar stranger [aka coworker] to make the next performance review ALL ultimately because of the bills I have to pay at home.  Why is it that only a few days or weeks out of the year do we get to really live life this way?  I hate work, as you can tell. I work at a large corporation. Although it is sucessful, it isn't all that great to work for. I think all employees either embody or are influecned by our cheifs personal goals and battles. What does every CEO want? More money, more power, and more of everything. So what has he done? He's created a machine [the company] to serve him. He's created a machine that serves to assist him in reaching his goals. That's good for him, but what of its employees? Fuck. Why should we fight his battle? We should all be fighting our own. It sucks. No one really likes it here - I can tell. We all pretend to like it here. Some of us have been pretending so long, we forget who the fuck we are. I wasn't born to be 'a system administrator' or wasn't born to be 'sales engineer' or a fucking 'materials planner'. Are these really the roles humans have settled on? We fought so many wars, traveled so many miles, and all for what? So we can sit in cubicles and make money? I walk across other people that don't even know how to say hi. Why? I'm just guessing, but they probably hate work just like me and would rather get their day finished, instead of wasting it with a familiar stranger [aka coworker]. That's sad. There's gotta be better out there. I hate kissing up to people. If someone were an idiot, gosh I wish I could just say it to their face and be on my way. But no, in the workplace we're encouraged to mingle with each other. Regardless of what we think of the other person. Even if we find them annoying or uninteresting.  I don't think humans are meant to live everyday life this way. I can tell from my coworkers and my own discontent. I have a coworker who only looks forward to coming home to his daughter. He's only here because, "he has to be." I have another who looks forward to preparing dinner for her family and spending time with them. 24 hours in a day and we usually spend 12 of them at work. Well, the time tables were probably similar 600 years ago. Men would go out to hunt and bring the kill home for dinner, but still. I think I know what the problem is. What is the driving force behind this company? Money. Revenue. Spend less make more. Cut back here, but increase there. Well, I find that troubling. Some of us don't really live to acquire more riches. Sure we all want a nice stable life, but why should we dedicate 50-60% of our days for it? That doesn't make sense. So what have people suggested? Get into real estate, make some money then retire. Fuck that. Real estate is even worse. An accelerated version of revenue over spiritual cultivation. My ex girlfriend was into that. She hated it. Back to the corporation. The driving force behind this company breeds disgruntlement and displeasure in its employees. I know it does. I feel it. I hear it. Every now and then someone will say something. "Well, thats the life of a contractor." [someone suffering from a cold but chose to work anyway - to pay bills of course]. "That was a good weekend with my family. Haven't seen them in 3 years. Well, back to work." Fucking lame.  Sheesh. Hahaha. Why so much rage? I just feel lethargic in this fucking company. I wish I could slay my Chief Officer who chooses to hide behind his fortified offices and rarely shows his face to the soliders fighting his war for him. That bastard. Hahaha.  Why so much rage? Man, I don't know. Oh yeah - I'm just here temporarily until I move onto better things. But for those that stay and like it here..... sad sad sad.  -Alastor.

       Yup. They can't. I have a long story to tell, but I'm sure you've heard it all before. I'm just adding one more vote to further affirm that chicks and guys can't be close friends - without something happening.
