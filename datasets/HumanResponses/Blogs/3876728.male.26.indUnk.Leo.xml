      Wow, a week went by without an update. That's way too long.  right, the last week, a night full of not sleeping, a day of bad headaches, and some good and bad times with my love. Stress is getting more and more due to a slow lawyer and some shoddy work from a financial company. The calender i made is working nicely, i replaced the lights that were broken in my house, and laundry is getting done. Dishes are stacking up, the pets i'm watching for my sister are more boring then i had thought, and my mom told me she won't be here for my birthday.  Everything i need to get done before i leave is getting more and more done, and i'm really troubled by Aileens stress level. (And by my lack of it at times.)

      I've nagged about the blog not being updated frequently enough, and the tables were turned and I was nagged for not doing it myself.&nbsp; So here I am, fulfiling my nag obligation. &nbsp; As Chrisje said, house stuff is moving.&nbsp; It seems like slowly right now, but I suspect it'll fly by and I'll run out of time to get everything done.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Add the stress of work-stuff, getting him here, having him here with me for 2 months, and moving all together and what you have is pretty much the basket case that I'm becoming.  &nbsp; Wheee...ain't life grand? &nbsp;

      ah, finally, another update.  So, the house is coming on nicely, paperwork is getting done, and the wheels are definatly rolling.  I'm feeling much much better, and that's always good.  Been to the doctor, who told me to have some blood examined just in case, and who told me not to worry about a bit of under-skin scar tissue (wich it turned out to be).  &nbsp;  I've gone and ordered my new glasses, wich should be done next week, made sure that i have a ride to the airport in three weeks (only three weeks!). Once i have them, i'll upload some pictures.  &nbsp;  I decided to make a good, useable calender today, and it looks great, just as i wanted it. now i won't forget all my appointments anymore!  &nbsp;  Aileen and i had a little crisis about painting something yesterday, but i think it has been solved, it was caused mainly due to me being very very stupid, and i learned something important.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Right, here is an overdue picture of me, one of Aileens Favorites.      No glasses on there, i had lenses then, and i had blonde hair!

      Ah, feeling better today. I woke with my sister calling me with the message that she was coming over to have coffee. She did, and we drank coffee, she made some use of my internet (she as of yet has none), and then she kindly offered me to help me with my large load of dishes. After that, she invited me to come have dinner, which I did, taking her bike from her for a few days when she left.  Before I left, and after I got back, I talked to Aileen, and she was, as I am, upset about how much I was affected by how sick I've been. I made an appointment with the doctor this morning, and tomorrow a lil after noon, I should get some insight as to why I have been feeling so sick and down lately.  So, Aileen has a bunch of appoinments for her house over the coming few days, and there will be more to do after that, and I really wish I could help. She picked the greatest  urlLink bathroom stuff  I have ever seen, coming with a matching shower curtain, and beautiful towels and the like.  I have vowed to myself to be here more to Aileen, and not be wallowing in self-pity for feeling so bad anymore.  Well, greetings for now, and until the next blog!

      Yesterday late night (for me, afternoon for Aileen), Aileen had another viewing of the house, and she went by the realtor agent to set the weels in motion. Today, she got the message that the deal was done, and the house was hers (ours). I've been strucken with the flu for the last week or so, and while i am recovering, i think i still need a few days of being careful, and i've been in bed far too long, and i've not been as present for my love as i want to be.  so, we have been playing a new game, and it's been fun so far.  Now, i just was mortified by seeing Kevin Sorbo as the captain of a starship in a very bad Sci-Fi television series, and i'll be glad never to see it again. He wasn't that good as Hercules, and that was the high point of his career...

      (being careful to not use the word 'disagree', in the event that anyone other than either of us ever reads this)  Months...it took the man  months  to confess his feelings.  Mighta prevented me a short-but-messy relationship in that time, had he opened his yap a bit sooner.  But a good friendship came out of the mess, so all is forgiven I s'pose.    Chrisje said:  "and i decided that i wanted to move to the USA to be with her"   I need to say, as I'm continually telling anyone who will listen -- there is nothing more flattering, selfless, loving, and giving than someone being willing to sacrifice their country, culture, language, friends, possessions, home, and family to be with someone else in a strange land, with strange people and customs.  There was never any question, debate, or negotiation.  He's never asked me to consider leaving the US to live in The Netherlands.  He's given me total control of his world, and asked for nothing in return.  I don't think I will ever receive a more cherished & precious gift.   Chrisje said:  "Parting from her was the hardest thing i ever did in my life"     This is something else I repeat ad-nauseum to anyone who will listen.  But we're okay now.  House-hunting together is a step toward our future and it keeps us focused on whats really important...ultimately being together.  Its big, and its scary.  But not badscary.   Just ohmygodifinallyknowwhatiwantwithmylifescary.

      Welcome to my blog.  Lets start at the beginning.  I'm a 25 year old man, born and raised in the south of Netherland, and still living there at the time of this writing.  Aileen, the lady i love more then anything in the world, lives in chicago.  My love Aileen and i met on  urlLink dark ages , an old on-line MMORPG, and from the moment we met, there was a certain thing there, we thought alike and had the same interests and kinds of humour. We where also both seeing someone. My girlfriend from then broke up with me shortly before christmas, and i started spending more time with Aileen. What started as a normal friendship in a MMORPG lasted through us both stopping playing the game, and we started to chat more and more together. Somewhere in February, i discovered that i was starting to fall in love with Aileen, and though i was hesistant to say it, i had the feeling she was falling in love with me too.  Then one afternoon, i told her how i felt, and shortly after, she told me that she loved me too, and even though there where still difficulities, all was well. Over time, we decided that i had to go there, and set a date in august i would come visit her.  Because Aileen had the feeling that the house she is living in would go from a lease to sold condos, and that she did not want to buy that house, we looked at houses on different sites, and discovered that we had largely the same taste in houses, much like we discovered that we had largely the same taste in a lot of things.   Things went so well, that we both knew that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together, and i decided that i wanted to move to the USA to be with her.  Somewhere at the end of may, being apart drove us both nuts, and we decided to meet in london over a long weekend. The weekend was the best one either of us had in our lives, and we both discovered that we where meant for each other.  Parting from her was the hardest thing i ever did in my life, and as we both missed each other to an extreme extent, we decided to move the date of me going there up a few weeks to the beginning of august.   In the last few weeks, apart from dealing with missing each other, we went over a long list of houses, narrowed it down to a smaller number, then she went and checked the neighbourhoods of the houses we had narrowed it down to, took pictures, and we narrowed it down even more. Yesterday, she went to see the six houses we had selected with her realtor agent, and we decided on wich one we want.  And that is where we are now. We decided that making a blog would be a great idea, so we can look back on what happened in the last few years, and here we are.

      Its not been our best week.  Truth be told, its probably been one of our worst.   Chris and I have very different approaches planning.  More specifically -- I do, and he doesn't.  I absolutely can't understand undertaking something like a 2 month trip without a ton of planning and preparation.  He can't understand my spreadsheets and schedules.  There's been a lot of bickering, yelling, and general grumpiness on both sides.   Yesterday was Chrisje's birthday.  Adult birthdays seem to be a much bigger deal in the Netherlands than in the US.  Add it to the list of things I try to understand, but just don't get.  So now its Wednesday morning in Europe.  Chris leaves for Amsterdam tomorrow afternoon, to spend a night at his uncle's, before leaving at the crack of dawn on Friday for his flight to me.    So we've one more day together before a day and a half apart...and then finally together again in the same place.  *gulps*  House stuff is house stuff.  Its all stressful.

      ah, things are still moving along. i'm slowly getting ready to leave my house for seven weeks, and plans for things in our new house are getting more and more present.  Went for a swim with my brother and sister today, in the Maas, a river not far from here. nice weather, fun water and a good mood made for a pleasant day.  Right, i really should get started on the dishes.
