      My father learned how to play baseball in 1936. He was standing in his front yard trying to get the hang of his new bat and ball. He was only four and his dad was working at the furniture store. Mom was inside. It was up to him to get started on the road to Cooperstown. He swung at the ball like he was splitting a log, with a big downward chop. It was not exactly how the Gas House gang was doing it up in St. Louis. Along William Street before they widened the road right up to the front porches, kids played ball in the front grass, or down at the school yard, if it wasn’t too dusty. Older kids played on a real diamond in Capaha Park. Older kids like Joe Delassus. He must have been 16 that year. Dad remembers that Joe took an interest in him that day when he was beating his new baseball into the ground like a railroad tie.  "Let me show you how to swing that bat," he said. And so it was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri that summer. The big kid next door gave dad his first baseball tutorial.   Dad didn’t make it to Cooperstown. He went to State College at Cape and eventually married my mom. After a stint at the furniture store, he left town and became a high school counselor in Columbia, Missouri. He didn’t teach baseball to the students. But he took an interest in me, and he bought me a ball and bat. By this time the family was living in Roeland Park, Kansas. Our baseball park in the front yard featured a birch tree along the first base line and a gas lamp post in center field. Joe's lessons were resurrected.   "Stand sideways. Hold the bat with your fists stacked on top of each other, like this," he said, as he put his big hands on my shoulders and turned me around. Even though I threw lefty, I batted right-handed that day, like dad, and I'll bet just like Joe Delassus. I couldn’t say for sure. I never met him. In fact, I didn’t know he existed until this year.  Dad surprises me once in a while with a new story. Most of time, he stays with the ten minutes of material he’s been doing at family gatherings for the last 35 years, but recently he told me how he learned to play the game, and about the big kid next door that took time out from being a teenager to spend some time with a pre-schooler because he knew how special baseball was, especially in hard times.  Joe left Missouri for good about 1942. He became a flight officer in the troop carrier command during the war. On September 19, 1944, while participating in action as part of Operation Market-Garden, Joseph H. Delassus disappeared when his glider was hit by German anti-aircraft fire over Holland. The official cause was listed as "finding of death" (FOD). They changed the MIAs to FODs in those days so families could begin receiving benefits.  He left behind a young bride when he died. They probably didn't have much time together. Joe won the air medal during previous action in Southern France. That citation, along with a new Oak Leaf cluster for Market-Garden, were presented to Mrs. Delassus after the war. It’s also a shame because the glider program suffered high casualties and because Operation Market-Garden failed. There were lots of flyers like Joe who paid with their lives on that mission.  Glider pilots didn’t get much glory, but baseball players did, and still do. Here in my front yard it happens daily. There's a glorious game afoot with the grandson of that William street pre-schooler.  He's five now and he bats right-handed, just like his dad, and his grandfather, and that big kid from next door, Joe Delassus.

       urlLink    On February 12, 1986, The Residents played Lawrence, Kansas. As part of their "13th Anniversary tour", they brought their unique music and stage show (and guitarist Snakefinger) to Cogburns (AKA the Bottleneck). How did a small Kansas college town secure a date on this prestigious tour? Former KJHK jock, music staffer, and Outhouse founding father John Cheney remembers:  FJ: First of all, describe The Residents to the uninitiated?  JC: I remember describing the show as the weirdest musical / dance show you could ever hope to see.  It was kind of like seeing a Bob Fosse ballet with Kraftwerk providing sound.  FJ: Who were the principal promoters involved in bringing the Residents to Cogburns?  JC: Duncan Burnette was the promoter and I was his Lawrence "liaison".  I approached Mona Tipton about having the show at Cogburns. She was a huge Residents fan and said sure! I also made the posters and tickets.  I took a poster for a Z grade movie from the 50's called "Teenage Frankenstein Meets Bloody Mary" and modified things until it was a Residents poster. Duncan lived in Kansas City, managed Rock Therapy records for years, and promoted a few incredible shows there in the mid 80's. A couple of my faves: Einsturzende Neubauten + Foetus, Nick Cave (right after the 1st Bad Seeds album came out), and Sonic Youth.  FJ: Once you found out The Residents were touring, how did you go about securing a Lawrence date?  JC: Duncan is the one who got in touch with the Residents. I think the booking agent that put together the Nick Cave tour recommended him as a potential promoter in the area.  FJ: Give me your impressions of Snakefinger?  JC: I thought Snakefinger was awesome!  I talked to him for awhile before the show.  He spent quite awhile playing pinball and talking about this and that.   He kept bringing up how much he loved Amsterdam and basically wanted to go there and never leave.  He was more gregarious than the rest of the folks on the tour.  FJ: To what extent did The Residents go to protect their identities?  JC: The Residents were very cool.  They didn't try to hide their faces or anything like that during the day. They looked like a genteel bunch of older San Francisco artists. The Residents are all guys.  There were two women with them as well that were dancers.  The whole group ate at Tin Pan Alley before the show. I don't remember anything about back stage. I think they hung out in their RV instead closer to show time. I do remember missing the first part of the show because Duncan and I were in the cooler counting money on top of a bunch of kegs.  FJ: How much did the band require for their show? Was it a flat fee or a percentage of the door?  JC: Memory is hazy here. I think it was $2000 plus (after Duncan recouped his expenses) a hefty percentage of the door. That was a ton of money for then! As a comparison I think he paid Sonic Youth about $700.  FJ: Cogburns was packed that night. Did you guys cover expenses?  JC: Unfortunately Duncan lost money.  I was very afraid that was going to happen and I had no financial reserves whatsoever.  I was doing good to cough up $150 / month for rent those days. He lost money on probably half the shows he promoted. I thought he was nuts but admired his tenacity.  His philosophy was that if some of these bands didn't play in the area he would have blown a couple hundred dollars flying to Chicago to see them.  So he figure he might as well bring them to town, get to meet them, and maybe, just maybe, not have to pay a couple hundred dollars for the privilege.  FJ: Did the band hang out in Lawrence before or after the show date?   JC: They drove in early that afternoon and I assume left the next morning. They stayed at a hotel somewhere in Lawrence. They were a little bummed about how small the stage was. As amazing as the show was visually, that wasn't their full-on stage show. I remember one of them also muttering that this was the first time they ever played in a "pool hall". Duncan joked about this being the honky-tonk stop on their tour. I thought they were being a little snooty about it. I didn't realize how small that space was for them until seeing them in Chicago a few years later on a full stage. They didn't waste any space even on a huge stage.  FJ: What surprised you the most about working with The Residents?  JC: I was surprised they were so mellow about being out of costume. I expected them to all secretive like KISS was. They were the first people I met who were very involved in the San Francisco art scene. I was impressed. They were more genteel than I expected.  They looked like they would have been right at home chatting with actors in the green room after some opera performance. I half expected a bunch of skinny junkies and social misfits, which pretty well describes what Einsturzende Neubauten looked like.  FJ: Do any bootleg recordings exist of the concert?  JC: I don't think so.  Someone said the sound man recorded the show but I don't think I ever heard it. They were one of the first bands I ever heard live that generated almost all their sound via synths and effects. Snakefinger had a strange, almost synth-like sound to his guitar too.  The show sounded amazing.  FJ: What was your favorite moment of the evening they played here?  JC: Finally relaxing during the 2nd set [with] A little pot in the ole' cranium and a beer in my hand. The music and visuals literally made me feel like I was tripping.  I was pretty much speechless after the show.  FJ: Besides The Residents concert, what other shows of note did you help bring to Lawrence?  JC: I don't know how noteworthy the individual shows were. A small group of us at KJHK did the bulk of the hustling that created the Outhouse.  A lot of those shows were local bands.  There was a lot of group effort in the shows, so I certainly can't take all the credit.  I did most of the work bringing DRI and Flaming Lips to town.  I tried to bring 7 Seconds to the Outhouse but they cancelled at the last minute.  The drummer got beat up so bad somewhere that he lost part of his hearing. One of my favorite shows there was the "Scum of the Earth" Halloween party at the Outhouse.  It was all local talent:  Near Death Experience, Mark Birch and V2 Snider, Battery Idiot, and a theater performance (ex-KJHK staffer) Tom Hoyt was in.  I went to Kansas City the night before that show and brought back a couple of pig heads.  They were stage props for a Foetus show Duncan promoted. The drummer of Near Death Experience had some day-glo paint.  One thing led to another, and one of the pig heads ended up hung on a wall under a black light.  People painted it all night. A lot of people didn't realize it was a real pig's head. I wasn't sure what to do with the head after the show.  I wanted to throw it in some farmer's pig pen hoping to trigger some rumors of some very weird cult in town, but couldn't think of any pig farms around. Some guys asked for it. They wrapped it up and gave it to some girl as a Halloween present. They made her promise not to open it until she was in her dorm room.  I don't know how many people remember Jed and Cindy. They were two crazy old school preachers that used to preach on campus. They were so outrageous and comical that I thought they were amazing. I talked Jed into preaching between bands at the Flaming Lips show, which was somewhat amusing to watch. I kind of forgot about that until a couple years later Rolling Stone did a big feature on Jed and Cindy. Jed reminisced that one of the weirder places he ever preached was at a punk rock show in Lawrence Kansas.  Jed even remembered that he was on stage after the Exploding Rodents (a local band). I'm sure that was the only time Rolling Stone ever mentioned the Exploding Rodents.  FJ: For the old cronies, give us the John Cheney update: Where you're  living, working, and who you're hanging with now.  JC: I am married (no kids) and live in Phoenix Arizona.  I lived in Indiana for about 10 years, and have been here since ‘97.  I'm a computer programmer now days.  Finally, after 35 or so miscellaneous jobs I found a career I like a lot that actually pays well.  I hang out with a motley collection of artists and musicians here in Phoenix, DJ'ing from time to time. I did get to meet Lydia Lunch and Jim Goad a couple months back by DJ'ing at her art opening here in Phoenix.  Lydia was very cool. The same gallery is bringing Mark Mothersbaugh to town next fall. I already volunteered to DJ that night!  I've had a big rambling website since about ‘97.  It's  urlLink HeathenWorld.com . The busiest part of the site is the "Origins of band names" page. I list about 700 bands and the etymology of their name.  It's always growing because people are always sending emails telling me new ones, or how wrong I am about existing listings.  My new hobby is making music...mostly computer based.   If you ever see a cd by "Heathen World" it's me. I'm also working on a soundtrack for a low budget movie a friend is making called Crimes Chapel.  It's based in the Chicago goth scene circa late 80's. It's going to be an interesting summer trying to get that together 'cause I don't really know what I'm doing at all.

      I've got a big problem with timelines. They stink. This whole pre-occupation with the line is not good. I remember in grade school, timelines were used incessantly to show the various  progressions  of different aspects of history. I recall the timeline of invention and the timeline of civilization. Progress doesn't happen in a steady, continuous fashion. That's a fallacy.  Here's an analogy that illustrates why one line doesn't make sense: A class room of elementary students meets at the school house each day. From all over their town, they make their way to the building where they learn to read and write. In an abstract sense, their journey from home to school represents an intersection of lines as each student comes from a different location to meet at the same place. At the end of the day the students leave school and return home. The school day and the lessons the students learned that day become a finite point in time and space. They are an aggregate of an insection of lines. This routine goes on for the entire school year. At the end of the year, A timeline of this achievement might show a straight line connecting the hundreds of individual school days to show a false lineage of the school year and how the students arrived at their present state of literacy. It discounts the true synergy of the achievement. Just as no student stayed in the physical confines of the schoolhouse for the duration of the school year, neither did they in the intellectual sense. The process of learning, discovery, and all kinds of evolution is not a linear progression. So the timeline is restrictive by its very nature. It's one single line. It can't the show the true nature of intellectual intersection that often results in a breakthrough. (This was the premise of the BBC show  Connections  that chronicled the unlikely alliances, coincidences, and associations that produced advancements in the pre-industrial England).   This is the same notion that Stilgoe nurtures in his work, "Outside Lies Magic". Lines are everywhere in our lives. Lines may be roads, or power wires, or railroad tracks. It's okay to follow them to see where they go or where they came from, but don't be afraid to stray from the right of way.  One of the most profound extensions of this rejection of the timeline came from Steven Jay Gould. Picture this graphic timeline. We've all seen it. It's the march of man through time as he evolves from the monkey. We've seen it in text books, we've seen it in literature both for and against the theory of evolution, and if you've been to Venice beach, you've seen it as a clay model. Gould said the notion of evolution moving from primitive, unintelligent life forms to complex, intelligent life forms is misplaced. He said: "life shows no trend to complexity in the usual sense — only an asymmetrical expansion of diversity". Diversity trumps complexity. I love it.  Part of the reason I've created this blog is to look back. I'm a nostalgic guy and I enjoy remembering the good times. It may be myopic, it may be romantic, but if I can make one connection with another person who remembers the same thing, then it's worth it. The other part will chronicle my personal search for the pearl. The pearl: that elusive McGuffin. The promise of a fulfilling life. I search for the pearl not because I feel my life is lacking, but because the search  is  the pearl.  If you give a camera to a child and develop the film they shoot, it resembles the roll Dustin Hoffman's character reveals at the end of "Rainman". There are pictures of manhole covers, bridge girders and unframed shots of landscapes and people. This is life: random snapshots of ephemera that add up to something in the end. Not knowing what it means at the moment it happens is no excuse to dismiss it. Savor the moment, then save it. Through the lens of reflection, someday you may realize what it's all about. Please, I beg you. Don't connect the dots with a straight line.

       urlLink    William Burroughs' legacy lives on in many ways, perhaps least of all with the new "Burroughs Creek". The 17th anniversary of the great River City Reunion is this September. Back in 1987, it was a week-long celebration of beat artists with performances by Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and John Giorno. Marianne Faithful, Jim Carroll, Timothy Leary, and Husker Du also appeared. This drawing was penned by underground comic artist S. Clay Wilson. I've still got my program from the event and I'll be posting lineups and schedules as we draw closer to the actual anniversary. What do you remember about the River City Reunion?

      Kansas City animator Jed Carter saw the Legendary Pink Dots last week at the Hurricane and said this:   The Pink Dots showed up with enough merchandise to cover the entire stage bar at the Hurricane, as usual.  And as usual there were about adozen releases that I'd neither seen nor heard of before - bunches of Pink Dots stuff, Tear Garden live albums & vinyl, and solo recordings from each of the band members.  The guitarist  (Eric?) hadn't yet toured the US with the band, but did really well.  Although Edward mentioned jetlag two or three times during  the performance (this was the first show on the American tour), they played a fairly long set and came out for an encore.  Hoornblower wore a slim-fitting spray painted (or sponge painted?) silver suit.  For the encore, he broke out the weird midi/synth horn thing he uses - it sounds like a sax being played through a pitch shifter set to -3 octaves.  He also roamed around the bar with a wireless sax for one song.  Honestly, I think he did manage to freak a few people out with that.  Not many people realize how much fun it could be to sneak up behind someone with an internally-lit saxophone & blast a high note at them.  I love seeing these guys. There's really never been anyone else like them, nor will there be.  It was a really solid show for the Dots & a nice break from being stuck working in studio all night.   Jed works at  urlLink MK12 , home of 4D softcore sweater porn and ultra love ninja.

      I'm officially 0-2 in Jeopardy auditions after failing to pass the ten question pre-test at Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri today. I felt pretty good about seven of the questions, but they threw in a British Royalty question, a Shakespeare question, and something about caviar and I was sunk. I don't know the actual score, unless you count "thank you for coming". That's what they said to me after they graded the test. Still, it was fun trying, and if I can make it again sometime, I'll stand in line with my kiddie almanac once more.

      I can't imagine why, but some people have better things to do than watch a game show rerun on Friday night. Here's a synopsis of the questions they asked me for those of you who missed the re-telecast on GSN.  Questions four and five were easy and I breezed through them to the first milestone at 1000 dollars. At least now I'm out of bonehead territory. In the months preceding this moment, I played the on-line version of the game at ABC.com. Originally, I tried to save my three lifelines for the harder questions. This strategy failed in practice. More than once I exited before the 32,000 dollar milestone with life lines unused. So my strategy was this: Use the lifelines early if necessary, stay in the game, and make 32K the goal.   Fast forward to question seven where I burned the ask the audience lifeline on a Mr. Rogers question at 4k going for 8k. They wanted to know the order in which he does his little ritual at the beginning of the show. I had a notion, but played it safe and the audience was right, Mr. Rogers does put on his shoes after he puts on his sweater. Commercial break. After the break, and some happy chat with Regis and Dad, we get back to the game. Suddenly, the whole thing goes to hell. The question is about boxers and which of the four recently released an album of Spanish and English ballads. I didn't know it. I had no inkling. Not a clue. I sat there and thought and thought about it. I was going to have to use another life line.  Damn it. This was not a David Mehnert question either (he told me later he didn't know it). No way my wife would know (she didn't). I could call my sociology professor from DeVry (he knew), I could call my ex-boss at Audio Reader (she knew), or I could call my ex-work bud (he didn't know). Guess who I picked? Rob A. didn't have a clue either. As my 30 seconds on the phone with him expired, he apologized and I told him "that's okay". At least I was building some good will with the home viewers as my millionaire gravy train went down the joint. It was agony. I blew the last lifeline. It was the 50/50 and they took away two wrong answers. It was either Oscar De La Hoya or Julio Cesear Chavez. I said the hell with it. It ain't no fun to walk at 8k like the dude from the previous show. I closed my eyes, made a wish and guessed "De La Hoya". I was right! The studio audience went wild.  At 16k going for 32 with no lifelines left, another difficult poser appeared on my display. This time it was about the polling place for the electoral college. Another guess, state capitals over Washington D.C. and I made the 32k milestone. Regis was ecstatic.  At the break, I was visited in situ by the show's creator himself, Mr. Michael Davies. He came down from the booth to tell me that the previous segment was one of the best they'd experienced in a long, long time. It was suspenseful, emotional, and real. I considered it a great honor to meet him and was most grateful for his kind words.  Next up: 32k going for 64. I finally got one in my wheel-house. American military history is a strong area for me. Plus I have a map of the US on my cube wall at work. So when they asked me what state Custer's last stand took place in, I said, "Montana, final answer" without hesitation. Suddenly, I'm sitting on 64 thousand dollars with a big smile on my face.  At 64k going for 125k, It's a British history question about the restoration. Namely, what the hell is it? I bought an almanac to study in the hotel the night before the show. I scanned a history of the British monarchy among one of my topics. At one point, the monarchy was destroyed and a puritan named Cromwell took over. But it didn't last. I said to Regis, "Maybe today is my lucky day," and guessed "British Monarchy". I was right and 125k was mine.  125k going for 250k. It's an Olympic history question about what event wasn't in the ancient version. I didn't have a clue, or a life-line, or 93 thousand dollars to blow. So I recused myself at 125k and walked away. The answer was marathon.  You need 15 correct answers in a row for a million. I could only muster 12 in a row. I have no regrets, except the obvious. I still want to be a millionaire.

      Part one of my 'Millionaire' experience aired last night (5/20), but my run in the hot seat continues in earnest at 7pm tonight (Friday, May 21st) on GSN. If you're just joining the blog, read the previous entry before this one to get the story in chronological order.  I stood up and shouted when my name began blinking on the screen. Regis shook my hand and we got down to business. A producer phoned my phone a friends and put them all on stand by as was procedure. There was only time for the first three questions before the show ended. I got them right. Regis announced the next group of contestants and the lights dimmed. I was the new carry-over contestant at 300 dollars. The next show taped the following day as part of a two-show tape date.  I was blown away by my good fortune and nearly a babbling idiot on the way back to the hotel. I could barely remember the first three questions they asked me. I went to my room and made calls. Brent told me that they weren't able to reach my fifth phone-friend, my wife, to give her the news. So she didn't know I had made it when I called. I played it cool and tried to lead her down that path. She was very sympathetic and understanding. It made it all the more sweet when I told her the outcome of the final fastest finger. I cried tears of joy. Later, I dialed my other phone-friends and got them back on in the fold for the next show. It taped the next day at 1pm.  Dad and I had dinner in the restaurant downstairs at the Empire hotel. I was exhausted. After dinner, we watched TV in the room and I read my almanac. I glanced over an item about the lineage of the British Monarchy that would prove valuable in the hot seat the next day. Oddly, I could not get to sleep any easier than the first night even though I knew I was in the chair to start the show. I finally dozed off about 2am.  The next day, I met a producer in the lobby at 10am and we went over to the studios. This was after the gang of 20 contestants from the two tapings went over. I think one of them mentioned a 7am lobby call. Like Andy Aaron, carry-over contestant from the day before, I joined the group during rehearsal and silently took a seat with my Dad in the bleachers. There were some women contestants in these two groups including the fetching Kim Nixon, a dentist from California.  It was cool being the carry-over. I felt the status boost accorded by the other contestants. I had already done what they wanted to do. I was relaxed and jovial, more so than the first day although I nearly freaked when we returned to the green room by the commissary and there wasn't any coffee. I usually have three cups in me by 11am and there wasn't a drop left. I had yet to have one cup of joe and I was gonna need it bad. Producer Lauren got some more for us. We ate lunch and I met two other people from Kansas. One, Jeff Moran, is a sex-education/history professor at K.U. (where I attended in the mid 80s, Journalism, class of '88). He taped in the second show. There was also a woman from Kansas but I have forgotten her name. Neither made it past their fast finger trials.   After the meal (I picked at some swiss steak), they took the people for the first taping to make-up and wardrobe. As carry-over man, I was all cool cause I knew everybody's name and knew the routine. I tried not to be cocky. After all, I was only at 300 dollars and I'm sure there were a few folks who were secretly hoping I would exit early to maximize their chances. One person admitted they had groaned as a group when they found out during an earlier briefing that the carry over guy was only at 300 dollars. And who could blame them. I told the group I would try not to take too long. One gentleman, Joel Reid, was especially cordial during the brief time we were hanging out beforehand. He was a returning contestant like Andy Aaron. He had been on a year earlier but did not get in the hot seat.   I waited until the end to get in the makeup chair and the nice lady did my face again. I've forgotten her name. She told me she was working on the movie "Vanilla Sky" when she wasn't doing Millionaire. Finally, we marched single-file into the studio where the audience was warming up. I was last in line (the eleven spot) and told the guy in front of me (my spot from the day before) that it was a good place to be. I was trying to be nice. It wasn't as lucky for him. He didn't make it. No thanks to me. I took up half the show myself.  They put the cordless mics on all of us and as we stood there under the bleachers in the relative darkness, I became overwhelmed with feelings of awe and happiness. I got misty for a moment and sucked it up. I didn't want to ruin my makeup after all!   They announced the 10 contestants and then introduced me. I ran out for a curtain call and shook the hand of floor director before retreating into the tunnel. I must say the crowd on the second day was much more energetic. There were more youngsters out there and they really whooped it up. I stood by and then suddenly Regis appeared on the other side of the tunnel. He brushed his hair and went over some notes with Wendy. Then he turned and said "Hello, Fowler". We were ready to start the show.  Away we went with a handshake and Regis and I walked to the chairs and the adventure began. Almost immediately, we stopped down for something and I sat staring at the logo on the screen in front of me. This was it. It was the moment I'd been waiting for and it had come true for me. It was surreal and ultra-real. Find out how I did. Tune into GSN for my 15 minutes of fame on tonight's rerun of "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire".

      My mother-in-law was in town in September of 2000 and we were watching television one evening. The millionaire show was on and she asked me if I ever tried calling the toll-free number to be a contestant. This was about a year after the show debuted and nearly as long since I tried the number. I remembered they asked three trivia questions if you got through and recorded your answers but I wasn't good enough to get past those questions.   That night I tried the number again and to my surprise and delight I got through the three questions. It was all automated but the recording told me my name and information was now entered in a random drawing for the second round of qualifying. If I was chosen, they would call me at a number I supplied between 11am and 2pm the following day. I gave the computer my work phone and ate lunch at my desk the next day. No call came through for me. I tried once more that night. Again, I got all three trivia questions right and the next day I got a call from ABC. It was a real live person this time on the other end of the line. He asked me all sorts of eligibility questions and I passed because he gave me the secret toll-free number and PIN for round three. I was very excited. If I answered this series of questions correctly, I might be going to New York to tape the program.  Three days later at the appointed time I phoned in for the next round of questions. Back to the automation system this time with five questions instead of three. I got the first four right but missed the fifth question. Who was born first: Miles Davis or Perry Como? I said Davis but Como is actually older.  I came so close! I was more determined than ever to get back to the third round. Fast forward to November. Three months later and I was still trying everyday when the phone lines were open. They weren't open all the time. I made it back to round three in October but fared worse, missing two questions. So anyway, it's the weekend after Thanksgiving and once again I qualify for the third round. (I had qualified for round two six times total, with callbacks three times for round three).  The phone game is tricky because you have to put things in order. The question might be "put these presidents in order of term, starting with the most recent and working backwards: 1)James Buchanan, 2) Jimmy Carter, 3) Woodrow Wilson, and 4) John Adams. So not only do you have to know the answer, you have to make the corresponding association to the order, rearrange them accordingly, and punch it in on your touch tone phone. So the answer to our question would be 2-3-1-4. You get the idea.  Three days later I took a pad and pen into a conference room, put the phone on speaker, and called the toll free number. Here were the questions. I had 10 seconds to answer each one.  Put these numbered song titles in order beginning with the smallest  1) 1999 2) 99 Red Balloons 3) Eight Days a Week 4) One is the loneliest number   Answer: 4-3-2-1  Put these historical events in the order they occurred, beginning with the earliest  1) Grand Canyon becomes National park 2) The NFL is formed 3) Glenn Miller dies in a plane crash 4) Hostage crisis in Iran  Answer: 1-3-2-4  Put these movie titles in order of release date, beginning with the earliest  1) roadtrip 2) thelma & louise 3) muppets take Manhattan 4) easy rider  Answer: 4-3-2-1  Put these people in order of their year of birth beginning with the most recent  1) Matt Lauer 2) Edward R. Murrow 3) Charles Kuralt 4) Joseph Pulitzer  Answer: 1-3-2-4  Put these islands in order moving east from the Hawaiian islands  1) Canary 2) Solomon 3) Philippines 4) West Indies  Answer: 4-1-2-3  I rocked the house going 5 for 5. Now all I needed was the callback. The recording said if I were chosen, I'd be called between 4pm and 7pm that day. I sat at my desk waiting. At 5pm there was no call, but that's no big deal. At 6pm still nothing and I'm starting to wonder. At 6:30, I'm still sitting at my desk at the office waiting and hoping and beginning to wonder what the heck it will take to make it.  Finally, at 6:35pm, I get the call. It's a producer from the show and after some more eligibility questions, they tell me I've been selected to appear as a finalist on the TV program. I had one week to prepare, but I had done it. I was going to New York to meet Regis and try to win One Million Dollars! The first order of business was to pick a companion to accompany me. If I got in the hot seat, this person would also appear on the show as I'm sure you know.  My wife Sue was my first choice but our son Skyler was only 18 months old and not ready for New York travel. My parents would keep him but my Mom was to be in Cape Girardeau with my Grandmother. So that effectively removed my Grandma, Wife, and Mom. So my Dad got tapped.  Pop became my secret weapon in this adventure. He's a psychologist by trade and recently he showed me a video tape of a new technique used by therapists in California called eye movement de-sensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). It's a simple but effective technique used to drain off excess anxiety in the brain by getting the brain hemispheres in sync. It's used primarily in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. It helps people come to terms with traumatic events of the past. It has a secondary use among people in anticipation of events, like a performance, to help quell stage fright.  We decide to use EMDR in anticipation of the millionaire event. I was worried about not being able to use the equipment effectively. They have some buttons on a panel that you use to punch in your answers for the fastest finger questions. So Dad and I used EMDR to explore that.   The network paid for the airplane tickets, hotel, and transportation, so all I needed to do was arrange for my phone-a-friend. Actually, they let you have five friends standing by and then based on the question that's giving you trouble, you pick which one to call. At the tip top of my list was a man named David Mehnert! David and I had caught up earlier that year when I saw his email address on one of those reunion websites (planetalumni.com, I think). He agreed to be available during the taping window and I supplemented my list with my wife, my sociology professor from DeVry, my ex-boss from Audio Reader in Lawrence, and a guy I worked with at my first I.T. job at Waddell and Reed. Everybody was set.  The buzz was starting to build at my work. I took three days of vacation to cover my trip. Everybody was very excited as word spread of my impending appointment with Regis. I'd overcome some terrific odds to make it this far. Now, I had a one in ten shot at getting to the money questions. I confidently told a co-worker that if I had no less than three chances to get in the hot seat, I would be there.  Finally, the day arrived and Pop and I headed to KCI. When I picked up the tickets at the counter, it sunk in for me. This was really happening. We arrived at LaGuardia airport at 1:30pm local time. We got an excellent view of Manhattan looking north as we swooped into the area on our TWA jet. John, from the car service, was waiting for us when we hit the terminal. A native New Yorker, John showed no fear navigating the always-heavy in-bound traffic. Our hotel, the Empire, at west 63rd and Broadway was a small, elegant eleven story building. The lobby was posh but the room was small and the bathroom even smaller. We settled in and I phoned my millionaire contact in residence at the hotel, Susan Vescera. A meeting to receive per-diem and get wardrobe approval was scheduled for 5:30pm. In the meantime, I phoned the associate producer at the show who was assigned to me, Brent, to inform him of my arrival. Dad took a nap.  I phoned two KU college friends, Alex Rappoport and Michael Bassin to see what they were doing for dinner. We agreed to meet at "Joe's Shanghai" in Chinatown at 7:30pm. Brent phoned me back to conduct a pre-interview. In the event I made it into the hot seat, Regis needed notes about my personal life for the chat segments. Pre-interviews and notes were compiled for all contestants. Afterward, I read the almanac to kill some time before the 5:30 meeting. When I arrived at suite 1124 with show clothes in tow, I saw my competition for the first time. Nine other gentlemen of various shapes and sizes greeted me with varying degrees of good cheer. I adopted a cool demeanor. In time, I warmed up to all the other contestants.   All ten of us signed a release for our per-diem and were given 150 dollars in cash for our three days in the city. Packets were distributed with the complete rules and other release forms. We were instructed to be in the lobby the following day at 9:45am. A shuttle would transport the contestants and our companions to the ABC studios. We were instructed to dress casually and for warmth. The studio was kept at 65 degrees. We were to bring our approved show clothes along with us. Prior to the start of the show at 4pm, we would go to our dressing room for wardrobe, hair, and makeup. After the meeting, I took Dad back to the suite to get his brown jacket approved. It had a funky sharktooth pattern happening and I was afraid it might not be up to standards but it was deemed acceptable.  The cab ride to Chinatown took 30 minutes and nearly 13 dollars. We struggled through the theater district and Times Square. I spied the hotel where I stayed during my first visit to the city in 1974. The Edison Hotel at Times Square appeared to be going strong. It's famous for being the former home of band leader Ozzie Nelson in the 1930s. When we stayed there in the 70s, the aura of times square was quite different than it is today. There were strip clubs and porno houses everywhere. The Nelsons would have been ashamed. I was also happy to see the Howard Johnson's coffee shop where Granny and I ate breakfast on that same east coast bus tour. It was famous because Lilly Tomlin waited tables there in the 1960s. Now she has her name up in lights nearby for her award-winning one-woman show. In fact the lights at Times Square were impressive. Our cabby swung over to the east side, past Grand Central. A quick right turn at the United Nations building on F.D.R drive and we were on the fast track to the lower east side.  The restaurant in Chinatown was a dim sum place. You sat train-style at huge circular tables for ten people. By train-style I mean if your party was less than ten people, they seated strangers with you to fill up the extra space. My friend Alex appeared bearing gifts. He bestowed upon me a lucky charm of sorts, a pocket-sized laughing Buddha. The laughing Buddha is said to bring financial good luck. I carried this with me the next day. Later that evening in the hotel, I had trouble falling asleep. Imagine  that! I finally nodded off about 2am.  The ABC staff treated us well. They were nice through every phase of the experience. Even though the show taping would take two hours, we spent a full day at the studio. Once inside the complex, we could not take phone calls, go to the bathroom unescorted, or consult reference materials. We were in lock down to avoid any appearance of cheating.  We had a continental breakfast in the commissary and found out that our carry-over contestant was going for 500K at the start of our show. That was great news! There would be more time (and theoretically more chances) to get in the hot seat for the lot of us.  Our producer chatted with us again about background material and we went to the studio to rehearse. We practiced the introduction routine and all of us took turns sitting in the hot seat and using life-lines. We also got rapid-fire practice on the equipment with sample fastest-finger questions. I got the best time on the first four questions. Thanks Dad! (and EMDR). But the machinery was not idiot proof. It allowed you to punch in the same response more than once and if you held a key down, it repeated. It had a backspace key and a send key. It was the size of a X-Box controller, so most guys used their thumbs. My friend Chris Shanahan told me that he heard that the forefinger has a slightly faster response time than the thumb so I adopted that strategy.   We headed back to the green room and waited for makeup call. The makeup gal was so nice. All ten of us shared a dressing room and the mood was cheerful. Our carry over contestant regaled us with stories of the hot seat and his experience from the previous day.  We filed down to the studio where the crowd was waiting for us. They introduced us to applause, Regis appeared moments before the taping started, and away we went! Find out what happened. Tune into "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire", with my episode repeating at 7pm central time tonight (May 20th, 2004) on GSN cable.

      The Jeopardy "Brain Bus" is coming to Kansas City at 4pm, May 24th at Union Station. I'll be there attempting to audition for the program. This will be my second audition for the show.   Back in 1988, I unsuccessfully auditioned for the program. One day Channel five flashed an address for interested parties to send in a postcard for a random drawing to gain admission to an audition. I sent in 25 postcards and got the call. The audition was at the Hyatt Regency hotel and I took time off from my job at Audio Reader in Lawrence to attend.  The format in those days was different than it is now. About 100 of us took a written exam. The format was roughly 50 fill-in-the-blank questions. What kind of animal is the mascot for the U.S. coast guard? (It's a goat). Who was known as the Swedish Nightingale? (Jenny Lind). After the exams were graded they took three people to the next round, a mock game of Jeopardy. The equipment was on display at the front of the room. I didn't make the cut. I don't know what the cutoff line was, or what my grade was on the exam. That information was a secret. They also said there was no quota. They would take as many as qualified. Exactly three people qualified and that's how many you need for a game of Jeopardy. It was a fun experience, except I got a parking ticket.  The new Jeopardy purgative elixir side show promises the first 1000 people will have a chance to take a ten question quiz. If you pass, you may be asked back for another audition the following day. Presumably, if you pass that audition, your information, including a photo, will be added to the contestant pool. Prospective contestants in the pool may be called to the show anytime in the next six months to a year. But it's not a guarantee. Once you're invited to the show, it's up to you to get yourself to Los Angeles for the taping. I'm not complaining. I'll do it. I love trivia. And there's nothing trivial about matching wits with others for a chance at winning tens of thousands of dollars.

      It occurred to me that Roesland elementary students have to attend middle school at Antioch middle school, formerly known as Milburn Junior High. That's a long way. Indian hills is much closer. At least the district has the sense to  urlLink send Westwood View kids to Indian Hills  these days. When I attended Roesland, we lost a few kids to Indian Hills. If you lived south of Mission road, along Brookridge, or in Rinehart Estates, you went to Indian Hills and S.M. East. Westwood View kids who lived south of Shawnee Mission Parkway also went that route. But chances are remote that Roesland kids will be consumed by the East attendance area anytime soon. According to  urlLink this article , East has recently experienced overcrowding. Also note, Roesland is slated to be completely rebuilt. Roesland students will be sent to Somerset school during construction. Somerset is closing at the end of this year.

      Love him or loathe him, Steve Albini was right about Liz Phair. You heard it here last. Liz Phair is a sellout.    But I still disagree with Albini about The Pixies.

      John R. Stilgoe is a Harvard professor of Landscape History. He's written a fabulous book about regaining history in everyday places. If you like walking, bicycling, or snapping pictures of ephemeral subjects in the neighborhood, then this book is for you. His theories cut to the core of learning. Here's a quote that sums up the theme:  "Discovering bits and pieces of peculiar, idiosyncratic importance in ordinary metropolitan landscape scrapes away the deep veneer of programmed learning that overlies and smothers the self-directed learning of childhood and adolescence."  The book is called  urlLink Outside Lies Magic . Once you read it you'll never look at a manhole cover or utility pole quite the same way.

I've seen other shows there including: Buckwheat Zydeco, Kill Whitey, Dread Zeppelin. Too many to remember. The last show listed on the website is a June date for Dick Dale. Get down there for one last drink before it's too late. The bar will be remodeled and reopened later this summer by the people that own the Beaumont club as the "Blue Bar".

      No more mass emails. I'm posting here from now on. It's less junk in your mailbox and I'll have a permenant record of my thoughts. The title of the blog is a paraphrase from Kerouac's  "On the Road" . The narrator is foreshadowing the adventure when he says:  "Somewhere along the line I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything;  somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me"   So I begin with the end in mind. If I never make another post I wanted to let you know. Keep searching for the pearl. You may already have it.

      One the very first pop songs that caught my attention back in 1983 when I started listening to KJHK was "Take Back Your Letters" by Tommy Keene. We had it on tape cartridge at the station and it got a lot of airplay. A few years later, when Tommy was releasing a new record, I had the privlege of doing a phone interview with him. What impressed me the most was that he still remembered that KJHK was one of the first stations to add his music and he singled out ex-staffers Kim Buie and Blake Gumprecht by name. That was 1986 or 1987 and Tommy Keene is still making music today.

      Turn off the computer. Go outside and take a walk. Your secret history is never far away. For instance, in my Stanley, Kansas neighborhood, a rail line used to run from Olathe east to Martin City, stopping in Stanley. The track is visible on an 1886 county map, but was abandoned by the 1930s. Part of the old right of way is now iron horse golf course and the walking paths along Negro creek in the Creekside sub-division. On my walks and bike rides, I've searched for clues of the railroad but I haven't found any yet.

       urlLink    Horrocks Youker was my great uncle. While his legacy doesn't involve issue, he never married, he did collect more treasure than any other relative. The items from his collection, while somewhat obscure, and not of immense value, never fail to fascinate me.  Uncle Horrocks died in 1982. I have inherited some of the items that he accumulated over his lifetime. Last year, Horrocks' sister Hilda, my grandmother, gave us another item acquired by Horrocks during his many years in upstate New York. This rare piece of correspondence was written by Adalbert Perry, corporal in the New York infantry, in May of 1861.    Mr. Nicklas Moyer Little Falls Herkimer County, New York  Albany, May 23rd, 1861  Uncle Nick,  I now take my pen in hand to let you know that haint forgot you yet. I wish you was down here to see us and see how we live. we have enough to eat but it is coarse. we don't have no pie or cake as I did at home but I am getting fat as a hog. I wish you was down here yesterday to see us inspected and see Jake Casler. the doctor struck him in the breast and how he did cough. That did not do any good as the doctor said he was all sound. that makes him feel bad. that dont do any good. the boys is all happy they want to go south. they are sick of Albany. We have a good time here altogether. I want you to tell all of [the] boys that [ ] all right. Tell Tom Flansby and Dan Fl I wish I could be there and drink with them. we drill about 21 hours in a day. we have got good officers and  we are all for the union and the Stars and Stripes. I am corporal over the gard. to night when I write this letter, we have 80 men and they are good ones to. we will show you what old Herkimer co[unty] can do if we have to fight. I think I will come home when I get my uniform if i can. if you see any of my folks tell them we are all right and I would like to hear from them. i have wrote to them but they haint to me. now I don't care if they dont. I wrote to Tom Flansby and he haint answered my letter. I know where my friends is now. that is all a soldier cares for is letters but I dont get any. I dont want you to forget and write and let me know how things is there. it is great here. there is 16 hundred of us boards in one house and we have rats once and a while but we don't mind that a bit for we are [used] to it now. So dont forget and write.  So Good by at Present From Adalbert Perry 2nd Corporal Company A, 38th Regiment  Direct your letter to me in care of [ ] , Company A 38 Reg   I conducted some follow-up research on Adalbert Perry that produced curious results. I could not find record of him in the 38th regiment, but an independent source lists him as being in the  urlLink 34th New York regiment  by June, 1861. It also lists Jake Casler, who was mentioned by name in the letter. The 34th saw a lot of action during 1862-1863 including Antietam and Fredericksburg. Oddly, the envelope is postmarked May 4, and the letter is dated May 23. This indicates that the letter recipient probably received more than one letter from the author. If you have any information about Adalbert Perry, please contact me: fowlerjones@yahoo.com.

      Mike Watt of  urlLink Minutemen  and  urlLink fIREHOSE  fame has a  urlLink website . He's still jammin' econo after all these years.  Mike Watt visited Lawrence at least twice during my college radio days. In May 1985, The Minutemen played "Day on the Green Hill", in the union ballroom due to inclement weather. I missed my chance to hang out with the band when I was asked if they could come back to my place and use the shower. I lived in an Oread mansion at 1340 Tennessee and the shower was a rig job under the stairs in the basement. Too econo even for the minutemen, I thought. They may have ended up using the showers at Robinson Gymnasium, much as Mike Mills did during the R.E.M. show at Hoch the previous fall.  Following D. Boon's untimely death, Mike returned to Lawrence in the summer of 1986 with fIREHOSE. They toured with Sonic Youth and both bands played  urlLink The Outhouse . It was a small crowd. I estimate 25 people saw a great show.

      On June 18, 1967 THE WHO played the Monterey Pop festival. But do you care that five months later on November 17th, they  urlLink played Shawnee Mission South High School  in Overland Park, KS?  Shawnee Mission South grad John Ritland was there and he answered these questions:  FJ:  What's your most vivid memory of the SM South WHO concert?  JR:  In a nutshell, my shock at the unbelievable aural and visual power of their performance, and the accompanying disbelief that it was happening in the gym of my high school. A DJ from a local radio station (probably WHB) came out on stage following the opening act (The Bobby Soul Group) and tossed out souvenirs and promo items. The photo of the surging crowd on my website was taken at that time. Then the curtains parted and THE WHO exploded. I remember in particular them performing A Quick One, Boris the Spider, Happy Jack, and I Can See For Miles.  FJ:  Did you stick around for the Buckinghams? Was it "kind of a drag"?  JR:  Yes, I stayed for the "headliners." I was never a big fan of the Buckinghams, but they actually played pretty decent R&B and Soul for a bunch of white guys. Pity them for having to follow THE WHO that night.  FJ:  How accessible were the band members before and after the show? JR:  In hindsight, probably more than I realized at the time. I just didn't pursue it.  FJ:  The guy who owned "The Hawk" at KU, I don't remember his name, but his nickname was "The Count", he told me the guys from THE WHO and some South students went out driving muscle cars on the back rounds of Johnson County. Any memory of that?  JR:  No, I had not heard that, but I don't doubt it. Good story.  FJ: Was the South faculty uptight at all about the show?  JR: I doubt they were uptight prior to the show, but only because they did not know what was coming. However, at the conclusion of THE WHO's set, with the screaming feedback, smoke bombs, pieces of Moon's drum kit rolling in several directions, Daltry thrashing his microphone on the stage floor, and Townshend smashing his guitar over his amplifier, I think it is safe to assume some faculty members were very anxious and nervous.  FJ:  Was that your first rock concert? My first show was also THE WHO, but not until 1980 at Kemper arena, with the Pretenders opening. Did you catch that one by chance?  JR:  My first rock concert was the Dave Clark Five, before a screaming mob at Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium in 1964. Like the Beatles at the time, they did not have a PA, just small stage amps. You could not hear them. And yes, I did attend the 1980 WHO show at Kemper, but with some sadness as I recall.  Keith Moon had died a couple years earlier, and they were never the same without him. Kenny Jones did not seem to be a good fit. Other than the SM South concert, my most memorable WHO concert was in Kansas City's Freedom Palace in July of 1970, shortly after the release of Live at Leeds, and prior to Who's Next. They were at their absolute peak at that time, but were hampered that night by electrical failures. Townshend in his white boiler suit and black boots, Daltry in his Woodstock fringe vest, Entwistle in his skeleton suit, and Moon was just a blur.  FJ: Your web page has a lot of concert snapshots. And it looks like you attended KU. What's your favorite Hoch auditorium concert memory?  JR:  John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra was a terrific show. Also, BB King and Bonnie Raitt with Martin Mull was excellent. Both were around 1973 - 1974.  FJ: Any chance you saw the National Lampoon "Lemmings" road show, circa 1974 at Hoch?  JR:  No, unfortunately I missed that one. It would have been a rare opportunity to see some of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live. I don't know where I was or what I was doing that evening, but I was in the wrong place for sure.  FJ:  Do you still live in the K.C. area?  JR:  I live in the South of France. No wait, make that Omaha, NE.  JR:  The four photos I have on my website from the  urlLink WHO concert at SM South  were taken by a school staff photographer. A few days after the show, they had a table set up in the hall and were selling 8 x 10 glossy prints for a buck apiece. I bought only these four, most likely because I only had 4 dollars. I would love to see other photos from the  show, and include them on my website. I know they're out there somewhere. And I would like to confirm who took the photos (probably either Clyde Byers or Bruce Zimmerman) and give proper credit. If anyone can direct me to additional photos, or help with the identity of the photographer, please e-mail me at jritland@cox.net.

      Somewhere between the sleep deprivation and the head wound, I celebrated Father’s day this past Sunday.  If not for the birthday card, it might have been any other weekend.  Saturday night we set up a tent in the backyard for a campout. We checked the flashlight batteries and aired out the sleeping bags. My five year-old brought some stories to read and George the bear. We listened to the Royals game on the transistor radio.  "Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! This is great. This is great. This is great," he said. This was his first campout and the so far the reviews were good.  It had the makings of a classic father-son event. Lights out was at 9:30. That was late for him and early for me. I decided to roll with it and grab some extra sleep.  At 10:45 pm I was still awake. This campout business wasn’t as easy as I remembered. I had to pee. I quietly opened the tent door and eased myself out past my sleeping son. Inside the house I saw the immediate effect of my absence. My wife went to bed and left the back door open, the front door unlocked and the garage door up. The television was still on and Saturday Night Live's 'Weekend Update' was starting. I switched it off. After all security breaches were addressed, I returned to the tent for some well-earned rest.   I was still awake an hour later. It must have been the mountain dew I had at the T-ball game that afternoon. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Or maybe it was the four cups of coffee I drank before the mountain dew. I pondered the caffeine arithmetic.  At 11:55 pm I found the vintage earpiece and plugged it into the radio and relived one of the sacred pastimes of my youth; cruising the AM dial late at night for the clear channel stations in far flung places like Omaha, Dallas and Chicago.  My Spanish isn't that great anymore. Oh sure, I had 16 credit hours at college, but those Latin disc jockeys are so smooth. It was one big, long nosotros queremos bailar cada noche up and down the dial. My ears were done with the nostalgia about 12:15am. This was 90 minutes after my back was done. I had a sleeping bag and a foam pad, but the backyard terra firma was an unforgiving novia.  The last time I checked my watch it read 1:20 am. I dozed and drifted in and out of sleep. Traditional Mexican folk music and visions of Tina Fey danced through my head.  At 2:30 am I rolled over to find my son sitting up in his sleeping bag.  "What’s the matter, do you want to go inside," I said.   He lay down without a word. I don't think he gave my suggestion enough consideration. I noticed that the morning dew was already in full saturation mode. I felt the tent wall. It was cold and damp. I scooted away from the wall and pulled my boy in from his side. He sat up again.  "Are you cold? Do you want to go inside?"  No joy. He groaned and returned to his natural sleeping position, best described as the Jim Brown one-leg scissor-kick with stiff arm.   I had to pee again. What is it about sleeping 50 feet away from your backdoor that makes you have to go? I unzipped the tent door and started walking toward the deck. I could do it in the backyard, but somebody might see me.  "Technically officer, I'm on a campout. In keeping with the YMCA urinary accords of 1936, I am within my rights to whiz on this Bartlett Pear tree."  That summed up the night. I was awake every 90 minutes. At 6am my son woke up and we went inside. We watched cartoons. My wife got up and I went back to sleep for three hours.  I felt better after some cereal and a shower. The family presented the Father’s day gifts. The card featured an old lady with huge red lips all puckered up. The inside gag read "Kiss another year good-bye, Happy Birthday". My birthday was in April but I got the gist of it. My two year-old daughter helped me unwrap the gifts: three t-shirts and a book about coaching T-ball.  The kids clamored for a look at the book. They’re not into coaching, but they like to fight over things. I had a tenuous grip on the bottom front cover. My five year-old jerked the book up to keep it away from his sister and clobbered me between the eyes with the bound corner. Luckily for me it was a paperback. But I must say it’s one of the hardest paperback books on the market today. The publishers really squared off the corners too, with top-notch binding.   I was bleeding a bit. I grabbed one of the new T-shirts and covered the wound. In retrospect I over-reacted, but I'm entitled to some theatrics on my fake birthday.   "You could have put an eye out," I said through the shirt. It was cliché but true. If I was down to one eye this early in the fatherhood game, what were my odds of keeping the other with all the birthdays and holidays yet to come? Between the 4th of July and Flag day, I might as well ask for the Braille menu at Denny's from now on.  The moment passed. Like a lot of those kinds of moments, a deep breath later it was gone. We took a vote and it was unanimous: naps for the lot of us. I went outside to take down the tent and crawled inside with the sleeping bag and the bug spray and the underwear.   "This is Father's day. I am a father," I said to myself. And I thought about the old lady with the big lips and fell fast asleep.

      Shawnee Mission North and University of Kansas alumna  urlLink Laura Rauch  recently returned from France where she covered the D-Day anniversary for the Associated Press. Her photography assignments have included  war (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), sport (Olympics, Final Four) and hollywood (Oscars).  Laura was kind enough to answer some questions:  FJ: Was this your first trip to Normandy? Give me your impressions of the landscape and the graveyard.  LR: It was my third trip to Normandy and it won't be my last. I have yet to visit the famous Pegasus Bridge along with Gold, Sword and Juno beaches, which were taken by British and Canadian forces on D-Day. Like most Americans, the cemetery at Omaha Beach is the most powerful for me. When I look out over the sea of crosses and stars of David, I am overcome with an understanding that these men truly were among the greatest generation of Americans. They fought the good fight for all the right reasons. Anyone who doubts France's gratitude to the U.S. for the sacrifices of WWII need only go to Normandy to put their minds at rest. These people have never forgotten what the allied forces did for them and they're making sure their grandchildren don't forget either.  FJ: What surprised you the most about the WWII veterans you encountered?  LR: Just how spry they all remain and what great memories they have. They're so patriotic, I get choked up writing about them. They're mostly just folks. Some are kind and some are grumpy, but they're all great to me because of their incredible sacrifice for the people of Europe and for democracy. They give me hope because they represent what's best about America. I'm so saddened by our disjointed and partisan society of today. They remind me of what Americans are capable of when we work together. I know that sounds terribly sentimental, but it's so true.  FJ: You weren't the only North grad in Normandy that day. Tell me the story.  LR: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and fellow SMN graduate Richard Myers attended one of the events I covered in St. Mere Eglise, France. I was following him and photographing him with WWII paratroopers and he turned to me and asked me if I'd take his picture with one the veterans.  "Sure," I said, "anything for a Shawnee Mission North graduate."  He stopped and smiled and said, "I suppose you went to Hocker Grove too?"  "Yes sir, as a matter of fact, I did." We chatted for a moment and then went back to work. He's a very polite man.  FJ: Sometimes you go from shooting a pop culture event like the academy awards to a ceremony remembering our fallen war dead. How do you prepare yourself emotionally for such contrasting assignments?  LR: That's a good question Fowler because it does take a toll on me. It is hard for me to look at the pomp and circumstance that surrounds celebrity events. The public has a voracious appetite for entertainment news so I take it very seriously and do my best, but it doesn't come easy. You know in Russia, they revere their writers, painters and scientists they way we revere our movie stars and athletes. Don't get me wrong, I love sports and I love the movies, but they're leisure activities. It's difficult for me to watch the value placed on winning an Oscar. That so and so is a brilliant actor and made so many sacrifices for this picture or that picture. Please, it's called doing your job. Why isn't there an Academy Award equivalent for teachers, scientists or drug researchers?  FJ: People may not realize that in addition to being a talented photographer, you're also a very capable writer. When will we see more of your pen?  LR: You're very kind. I just wrote a short piece about Cirque du Soliel to go with a series of images I did on Cirque in Las Vegas. It's so difficult to write and shoot well at the same time so I'm not doing it much anymore. I do think about writing a book someday on some of my observations as a journalist. It would be awfully personal, though, so I may not have the guts to do it.  FJ: What's the most important lesson you learned while working for the University Daily Kansan?  LR: Make deadline and get the name and hometown of the person I photographed. It sounds simple, but it serves me well in my current job.  FJ: What instructor at K.U. had the biggest impact on your work?  LR: Paul Jess taught me to be a journalist. Wally Emerson taught me to see pictures. Mike Kautsch taught me to be responsible and to tell the truth. Mary Wallace believed in me the most. I would say the journalism school at KU is a classic example of the sum of its total being greater than its parts. It was a place of excellence and it challenged me not to fail. No other institution has ever done so much for me, that's why I remain such a loyal alumna.  FJ: Who are the photo-journalists working today that you idolize?   LR: War photographer and Seven agency founder Jim Nachtwey is the best there is and the best there ever was. Fellow Seven photographers Christopher Morris, John Stanmeyer and Ron Haviv are brilliant. I've recently discovered Getty photographer Ami Vitale and just love her work. I'm also a big fan of several Associated Press photographers: Jerome Delay, John Moore, Amy Sancetta, Lefteris Pitarakis and David Guttenfelder, just to name a few.  FJ: While working for the Wichita Eagle newspaper, your photos of a refurbished Air Force One received wide exposure. What did you think about that at the time? What year was that?  LR: How do you know about this? You're amazing, you really should have been a reporter.  I was on my way to shoot a baseball game and my editor called and told me it was my lucky day and to get over to Boeing. The new Air Force One was being delivered a month early because of Gulf War I and they needed a pool photographer to document it before the Air Force took possession of it. It was 1990, I believe, and my resales on the pictures changed my income bracket that year ( I also learned a lot about taxes). Nearly fifteen years later it's my understanding that those photos remain the only commercial images of the inside of Air Force One. By the way, the people of Wichita are really proud to have built that jet.  See more of Laura's  urlLink work  or read another  urlLink Rauch interview .

      Three words I don't often say, but I'm happy for Larry Brown's Pistons, now NBA champions. Let's face it, the man is a coaching genius. This was his first year in Detroit and he couldn't have done any better.  My first encounter with Coach Brown was in the spring of 1984. I was a freshman at K.U. and Larry was in his first year as basketball coach of the Jayhawks. As a producer for the public affairs call-in show on KJHK, I was learning the pitfalls of scheduling in studio guests. Show hosts Stu Wright and Craig Westhoff gave me a short list of local celebrities to book on the show: Gene Budig, Larry Brown, and William H. Burroughs. I went 0 for 3 by term's end. But one night when I was pretending to study at my Oliver Hall dorm room desk, the phone rang. It was Larry Brown returning my call.   "Hello, Fowler? Hi, this is Larry Brown. I'm sorry I can't do the talk show..."  He was the only one of the big three to give this freshman a personal return call.   Genius!  And if you don't believe me, stop and consider how Burroughs might have fared at the helm. No way he goes four games to one against Shaq and Kobe in the finals. No way. And Budig, he's a baseball fan. So forget it. Larry Brown is the man.

      Today's IMDB movie of the day is  urlLink Twin Peaks . The TV pilot was released theatrically in Europe (with a tidy ending), so I guess it counts as a movie.   I miss Twin Peaks, the TV show. I especially miss the comely Peggy Lipton. Sigh. I once listed "Pie and Coffee with Peggy Lipton" as my idea of a dream date. Heather Graham also appeared on the program. I would eat dessert with her too, I guess. No offense to Mrs. Jones, of course. I mean, afterall, we do take all our meals together. In fact we're getting together for Pizza later. I'll try to make it romantic. Romance is sometimes limited at establishments that furnish crayons at every table, but I'll try. We'll start with a Greek salad and see where that goes. Don't get your hopes up.  But Twin Peaks was a great show for many reasons. It was a murder mystery wrapped in super-natural horror, with comic flare unequalled by Picket Fences, Northern Exposure, or any other poser. Twin Peaks was the real deal. I think the show lagged for a bit after the resolution of the Laura Palmer arc, but it was poised for great things following the finale where Agent Cooper became the host for Killer Bob. Too bad it ended when it did.  Here's my favorite line from the entire show, delivered by actor Miquel Ferrer as special agent Rosenfield:   Now you listen to me. While I will admit to a certain cynicism, the fact is I am a naysayer and hatchetman in the fight against violence. I pride myself on taking a punch and I'll gladly take another because I choose to live my life in the company of Gandhi and King. My concerns are  global . I reject absolutely pride, aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love. I love you Sheriff Truman.   That declaration of brotherhood between two unlikely allies was unexpected, and Ferrer's earnest delivery made it quite amusing. What might seem like a bromide here in print was actually one of the most ironic and powerful scenes in the series. But don't take my word for it,  urlLink see Twin Peaks for yourself .

      I transcribed three new entries from  urlLink Aunt Mae Youker's diary  from 1914:  November 7th  Was in office all day until 5 o'clock. Not especially busy. Wrote note to Lucy. Laura Dygert and Purcell were both in. Laura stayed quite a little while and we had quite a visit. Went home, helped with supper, and took a bath, then went to choir rehearsal.Walked down from rehearsal with Helen Chapin. Walked up little ways with her and then came home and read until 11 o'clock.  November 29th  Slept until almost 2 o'clock. Stayed in house all rest of afternoon. Didn't get dressed until 5 o'clock. At about 5:30 Hazel stopped at house a minute and I walked up a little ways with her where she went home. On the way back, stopped in Greek's and bought dates and nuts and came home and made stuffed dates and also a cup of cocoa for myself. Hazel intended to come back in the evening to play but didn't come. Purcell came down about 8 o'clock and stayed until 10.  December 2nd  Went to moving pictures with Mamma. Saw the 5th installment of the Million Dollar Mystery. It still keeps interesting. After we got home Mamma made a cup of cocoa and then I went directly to bed.  Special train to Little Falls tonight for the Masonic Fair and at Main St. Station Mrs. Frank Santimer was struck by the train. She was injured but I guess not seriously. This is the first time anyone has ever been hurt by train at Main St. Station.

      Tomorrow’s passage of Venus in front of the sun is exactly the kind of event I might tout here, but I won’t be following my own advice. No transits for me before lunch time.  "Get out and see this once in lifetime event," I might write. "This is history. Don’t miss it," I’d say. But when the transit happens in the early morning sky here in Kansas, I’ll be asleep. I won’t be witnessing anything.  I started this web log with the highest ideals. "Perhaps I can offer a fresh perspective on the mundane," I wondered to myself. "I may be a suburbanite in the middle of America, but I can live and love and learn like a French foreign legion mercenary. Viva la blog!"  Yeah right. It’s hard to be an idealist at 5:45am. I think the best time for idealism is 5:45pm, preferably after a couple of drinks. Why can’t the transit be during cocktail hour? Give me a gin and tonic and a piece of cardboard and a needle. I’d be a witness to solar history. "Don’t look directly at the sun. Poke a hole in this drink menu and make a pinhole camera." Now that’s good advice.  Ever make a pinhole camera? I found step-by-step instructions on the web and I’d like to pass them along:  4-5 tonic water Ice Cubes  3 ounces gin  4 ounces tonic water  1 tablespoon lime juice  Lime wedge for garnish 1 eight by sixteen piece of cardboard 1 sewing needle  Place ice cubes in a chilled glass. Add gin, then tonic water, then lime juice, stir. Garnish with lime wedge, poke pinhole in cardboard and view transit of Venus immediately. Throw up. Go back to bed.

      I’m mad at Mr. Spock. I attended my first and last Star Trek convention at Municipal Auditorium in downtown Kansas City, Missouri in 1975. I never went back.  This was six years after Star Trek was cancelled and the people who later adopted Enterprise uniforms and the Klingon language as an alternative lifestyle were still being beaten up in grade school. These were proto-trekkie days. In fact, this wasn’t a Star Trek convention at all. They didn’t exist yet. It was an electronics show with Hamtronics radios and CB accessories on display.  I was ten years old and my dad and I were going through a phase when we attended a lot of exhibition shows at Municipal Auditorium. We went to the auto show many times. I once saw the Batmobile and TV’s Barbarino, John Travolta, on the same day. Another time we attended the psychic fair where dad signed up for the MUFON newsletter. There were no people there wearing tin foil hats, so don’t bother asking.   This was a special day back at the electronics show. Not that they weren’t all special. This day was extra special because Mr. Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy, was appearing at 2 o’clock. In a precursor to gatherings that typified the trekkie experience, the most famous alien since Michael Rennie was scheduled to say a few words and answer questions about the Star Trek television show. Was that cool or what? I was going to see Spock, all calm and logical, standing tall and throwing out pearls of Vulcan wisdom for the throngs of Kansas City electronics fans. If this show went well, why not make the Trek thing a recurring theme and tell the Heathkit nerds to get lost? I did the grammar school equivalent of being first in line at Studio 54, before all the polyester pants people on the upper west side found out about it. I was at a Star Trek convention before they had a name for it. Of course, I wasn’t cognizant of the cultural implications; this became clear only in retrospect. It didn’t matter anyway. I was about to shun the whole operation.  The electronics show occupied a sub-section of the anterior exhibition space in Municipal Auditorium. It was cramped. Cleverly deployed velvet curtains promoted a feeling of velvety intimacy. I climbed a stairwell to survey the scene. In 70’s parlance, there were not a lot of dy-no-mite chicks there.  It was two o’clock and no Nimoy. It was okay. I had a large soda and the JVC speaker vendor below me was groovin’ on Bohannon. 2:15 pm: I got restless. At 2:25 pm I bought another soda. More disco music played. Look, dad, I’m doing the “hustle” or I have to pee, I’m not sure. Anticipation kept building. Dad gestured for me to come down from the balcony. I turned and suddenly I’m face to face with the first officer of the Enterprise.  He had an entourage. That didn’t surprise me. After all, he was an important member of the federation of planets before cancellation. He wore a khaki windbreaker and slacks. Okay, that wasn’t what I expected, but it’s not a big deal. Silly of me to assume he’d be in costume. What a childish thing to think. He had something in his hand. It was a cigarette.  Spock smokes! I was mortified. He cupped the cherry like he was in a foxhole in the Ardennes. Only ex-cons and hardcore smokers did that. I couldn’t believe it. Travolta didn’t smoke when he was here. This was outrageous.  I followed the Marlboro Man down the stairs and passed him at the landing. He stopped there to address the crowd of disaffected ham radio operators and science-fiction enthusiasts. Everyone pretended like they didn’t see him smoking. We hushed as he spoke without a microphone.  “Sorry I’m late. My carton of Camels got lost in the transporter”.  That’s not really what he said. I don’t recall his exact words. He was good natured and didn’t make a long speech. We went right to the Q & A. He confirmed there was a movie in the works and Robert Redford would wear the ears for the big screen. That’s Vulcan humor. One guy in an army surplus jacket and wearing thick glasses with oversized aviator frames laughed. A few months later, Leonard did that line on the Johnny Carson show. It got it a few more laughs. Apparently there are more Redford fans in Burbank. I don’t know.  After questions from the audience including one from a knucklehead who asked about an episode of “Mission Impossible”, Leonard Nimoy flashed the Vulcan peace sign and left the building.   I’ve never forgiven Mr. Spock for smoking, until now.  I forgive you.   I forgive you  and  Mrs. McAllister, my 4th grade teacher at Roesland Elementary.  That’s right, I saw you in the teacher’s lounge one day after lunch. Don’t deny it, Virginia Slim.  And God Bless you Barbarino. You set a Municipal Auditorium no-smoking standard that remains unequaled to this day. Come back anytime, and feel free to bring the Batmobile with you.

       urlLink      Back in the late seventies, my friend Lori Dodge moved from the comfortable Nall Hills subdivision in Overland Park, Kansas, with its split-level houses, and close proximity to Metcalf South mall, to the jerkwater town of Gardner, Kansas. At least I thought it was jerkwater. It’s not. One day at summer camp, she told me about the new school in her town, Nike junior high.   "It used to be a missile base", she said.   It was a novel thought and we smiled at the notion of a military presence lingering in our avocado and burnt orange world. "In the event of nuclear holocaust, all intramural basketball games will be rescheduled".   I forgot about Nike junior high for a time. After all, junior highs don’t even rate a sports mention on the community page of the local paper. Even for the cold war kids who called themselves "the missiles".  Back in the 1950s, during the grand stand-off with Russia, American defense planners deployed short-range ground-to-air missiles as our last line of defense against Russian long-range bombers. The Nike missile program was designed to protect our cities, but when you considered this was Eastern Kansas, it became an ominous proposition. If Russian bombers were raiding Kansas City, then we were losing the war.   In those days, K.C. was a prime target on the Russian radar. Maybe not at first, but once they started cranking out those atomic bad-boys, you better believe we rated. Later, the minuteman program deployed nuclear warheads 60 miles east of town. Thank goodness it was downwind most days. So we definitely needed the Nike missile bases. I’ll bet in those days they pronounced it as one syllable. No matter, as long as they stayed awake out there. You never knew when those Frenchmen in Wichita would lay down for Ivan.  The Gardner Nike missile base (KC-60) was not a secret. The town gave a full-frontal embrace to the fire-control base. There were two parts to every Nike installation: the fire control base (our junior high in this story) and the actual silos. And for technological reasons known only to the vacuum tube set, the silos could not be too close to the control center.   If you want to see the intermediate school, nee junior high, it’s easy to find. Don’t even exit I-35. Spit out the southeast window of your vehicle at the Gardner exit. But if you want to see the silo slabs, get ready to climb fences and trespass. While my hobby de jour is exploring my extended neighborhood, I’m afraid some property owner will go all defcon one on me. Instead, why not see the installation like the Russians did,  urlLink from the air .  What a bit of post cold war fun. We’ve all had a jolly good civil defense laugh, ha ha. But the dead hand of the cold war is still a twitch away from a Dom Deluise moment in a  urlLink Fail-Safe  day. Dead bunny hats off to cool headed Ruskies like  urlLink Stanislav Petrov  who knew better than to launch his missiles on September 26, 1983, even when the computer system he designed said he was being attacked. Talk about " urlLink The Day After ". That was the day after the Wheat Meet keg party in the parking lot of the Burge Union during my freshman year at K.U. We weren’t due to be bombed until the November sweeps.   Who says it’s not exciting to live in Kansas? Let’s hope whoever makes the next nuke has the good sense to get the latest target data. Those underground silos were capped and filled with water in 1969, I swear.

       I manned the cart barn and bag storage for the country club golfers. That was my summer job with heavy emphasis on summer. There were long stretches of nothing but Kansas heat to keep me company as I waited on call for the next order. The phone rang. It was Craig calling from the air-conditioned pro shop upstairs.  "I need Mr. and Mrs. Haughtoddy on a top cart with a bag of balls," he said curtly. I guessed that Mr. Haughtoddy was standing at the pro shop counter. Craig was never that formal otherwise.  I got the golf bags from storage, strapped them on to the back of a green electric cart, and silently motored around to the first tee. I retraced my steps to the caddy shack and the order process renewed itself, unlike the hot, humid air. It lingered despite our best efforts to re-route it with oscillating fans.  Time passed. I listened absently to the AM radio. I tried the New York Times crossword puzzle, edited by Eugene T. Maleska. The phone rang again. This time it wasn't air-conditioned Craig. It was the assistant golf pro Gene, calling from the phone box at the driving range. How unusual. The locker bar received a few calls from the range. Occasionally, some fat cat ordered a club sandwich and a bloody mary for delivery. They'd run it up there too, probably with a linen napkin. But down in the caddy shack, we didn't get calls from the range unless there was a problem.  "Hey, there's a dead squirrel up here. Bring a trash bag or something and come get this thing," he said, and promptly hung up.  I grabbed a plastic sack and a golf club from the lost and found and hopped in the nearest empty cart. I pressed the electric pedal to the rubber mat, gained some speed heading down the hill behind number nine, angled across the swimming pool parking lot and coasted up the approach to the fifth green. I veered to the left, past the empty chipping area and onto the driving range tee. The circumstances of the real story became clear. Gene was giving a golf lesson and the member under his charge topped a worm-burner about 15 yards in front of the practice tee, hitting an innocent squirrel squarely in the head and knocking it senseless.  The fully grown grey squirrel lay motionless on the manicured fairway. His right eyeball was a solid red mass of blood. I approached him and leaned in cautiously. Was he was still breathing? I poked him with the blunt end of the golf club and he stirred. This dead squirrel was still alive.   "You're gonna need some gloves or something. You can't pick that thing up with a nine iron," said Gene. He was behaving impatiently on the member's behalf. I ignored him for the moment.  A bead of sweat rolled down my face. I fashioned an ersatz glove over my hand using the garbage bag, but the squirrel leaped up and without much sense or direction, scampered away before I bagged him. It was a relief for both of us.  * * *  About six weeks later I was hand picking the left rough at the range. It was an odd collection of berms, hills, and cherry trees. It was too lumpy and there were too many low hanging branches to run the range picker. But the scenery was good and if there weren't a bunch of hackers slicing range balls into the area, the shade provided some cool and quiet.   I got out of my cart and worked through the grove of small trees, looking for balls and punching them quietly into the canvas bag of the hand picker. Suddenly, there was some rustling in my left ear. I stopped and slowly turned my head. About a foot away, on a low branch in the nearby tree, a familiar grey squirrel clung to the wood.  Why was he perched so close? I peered at his face. His eye socket was an empty, fur-lined space. He couldn't see me.  Our accident victim had survived, albeit without his right eye. I became the beneficiary of this disability, getting close to him again, and knowing in an instant why we were here together. I relished his victory over the golf ball and the assistant pro. In this moment of triumph, I named him Wink.  After that evening I saw Wink again from time to time. He acted like he didn't know me. That was his way of dealing with it. I accepted Wink's cold resolve, secretly hoping that some day we'd share another moment among the cherry trees as I waited in the hot air back at the cart barn.

       When I was in the middle of undergraduate work at the University of Kansas in the mid 80's, the Radio-TV department degree sequence changed. They split it into two distinct programs. I ultimately chose the video production path through the Journalism school. It emphasized news reporting and commercial production. The other path, through theatre and media arts, concentrated on the traditional aspects of film making. Mark Adams is a prolific independent filmmaker who chose the other path. He's created a website filled with fabulous stories of film making. Here's an informal discussion of Chuck Berg, Centron, Jolliffe Hall, and other KU film making touchstones.        FJ: How did the degree sequence split effect you?   MA: During my freshman year at KU I was in the Radio, Television and Film ( urlLink RTVF ) department, then it became the Theater and Media Arts (THMA) department, and finally when I graduated it was the  urlLink Theater and Film  (TH&F) department, so there were a lot of changes when I was a student at KU. Of course I didn’t really start taking a lot of classes in my major until my Junior year, so I’m not sure how much things were still changing by the time I was taking the video production and film history classes rather than the required Math and English classes. I guess I was just an ignorant underclassman, so I don’t think it really affected me one way or another. I was just happy to finally be taking courses in my major. Since I was more interested in filmmaking rather than television broadcasting, I ended up on the theater and film side rather than journalism. I think at one point someone mentioned that the Journalism department had their own video editing equipment, and when I suggested we could try to use those to edit something it was made very clear to me that they would never allow someone from the Theater and Film Department to use them. So I realized there was some sort of separation there. I was just a naïve underclassman.

         It's Monday re-hash. I wrote this essay about trying to go to a Royals game back in 2002. Most of it is true, only the names of the waitresses have been changed.   The Royals game started at 6pm. Rob lived a couple of miles north of my place in Overland Park and he grabbed his umbrella as he walked out the door. It looked like rain. We picked up Steve at 4:30 and Burt five minutes later. We started early. We wanted to eat before the first pitch. The rain started sprinkling and the forecast was for a lot more before the end of the evening.   We drove to Ruthie's Key Hole in Mission to make plans. I had trouble parallel parking the minivan so Rob jumped out and directed me safely into the space like the guy with the snow-cone flashlights on the carrier deck. After borrowing a tape measure to reckon our distance to the curb we were satisfied with the results. Inside the tiny bar, a couple of regulars noted our arrival.   "I'm the designated driver," I dead-panned as they laughed about my parking job. The four of us sat down at the bar and nearly filled up the place. The Key Hole is tiny. It's so small they only have one bathroom. Their unisex facility predated the one on  Ally McBeal  by 35 years. It was now after 5 o'clock and our hopes of seeing the game diminished. I ordered a can of Miller High Life.   "You want a champagne glass with that," said Misty, the barmaid with the face that launched a thousand ship-wrecks. I declined. Two grizzled Key-Hole veterans walked in the back door. They stood around since we were hogging the bar. It was getting crowded with all nine of us in there. We decided to leave and eat at the Lucky Brew grille down the street.   "Lucky Bluegill? Sounds like a Burl Ives song," remarked Steve. That prompted my best Burl Ives impression as I piloted the Windstar past the Mission police station. It loses something in the retelling but trust me it was great. A quick check of the Delco AM radio revealed no Royals pre-game show despite the fact we were less than an hour away from the scheduled start of the game against the Red Sox. This was not a good sign.   At the Brew grille, we requested a table and got a booth instead. The conversation turned serious. We realized we hadn't been together since the world trade center towers fell. Rob told us about his recent trip to ground zero and the emotional impact of the visit that still lingered. That horrible day seemed so long ago. Were we too self-involved in our own day-to-day existence to comprehend the enormity of the events on 9-11? The answer would have to wait. The cheese dip had arrived.   It was really raining now. We gave up on going to the stadium. I passed out slips of paper and borrowed a pen from the waitress. We each wrote the name of a neighborhood bar that we'd never visited. The pub-crawl commenced.   Burt picked Geno's bar on Shawnee Mission parkway across from the old A & W root beer stand. He had a hard time thinking of a bar he'd never been to before. When we got to Geno's we discovered it was no longer named Geno's. For the remainder of this essay, it will be known as "the bar formerly known as Geno's" (TBFKAG). It seemed like old times when we spotted our favorite stool-holder from Ruthie's anchoring the corner seat. "Hey, are you guys stalking me," he said as he held a cigarette between his teeth. The smoke was going right in his eye, so he winked at us. What a kidder. He told his friends about my parking job at Ruthie's and we laughed and nearly bought him a beer. We quickly discovered TBFKAG also has a unisex bathroom and we wondered if this held some perverse appeal for our new bar buddy.  Heavy rain forced us to have two beers at this totally unremarkable establishment. I've been in church basement multi-purpose rooms on Indian reservations with more style than this place. The bar offered direct access to the deli next door. Steve, Burt, and Rob stepped through the swinging doors to check out the down-pour through the storefront windows next to the soup corner. The deli guy yelled at them for bringing their beers in. It was time to go.  The next stop was the El Torreon Mexican restaurant, home of the fishbowl margarita. Rob wanted to give it a try. The place was about twice the size of Ruthie's K-Hole. We sat down and ordered four of their signature cocktails. These drinks are unique. They're mostly tequila and glow like Prestone anti-freeze. They will mess you up if you're not careful. I recalled that a mutual friend used to be a waitress here in 1980. It hadn't changed much since then. They even had the same DeCloud studio portrait photo of a middle-aged woman on the wall. She had feathered hair and a white spaghetti-string western-style top with fringe. It's as though she was saying 'You could have seen me here if you had stopped by during Reagan's first term.' We suspected it was the owner's portrait but feathered hair and spaghetti-string western wear were in short supply among the staff.   It was Burt's round and before he paid the 23 dollars, he popped the question to the waitress. Burt likes to mess with the help at every place he visits. The waitress said no to the marriage proposal and took his money. He left her a generous tip that included one of those Sacagawea dollar coins. "That's not a quarter, you know."  The rain let up and we went to Schooners on the frontage road near 79th street. You can't go wrong with a joint on&nbsp;Frontage road. Either 'Frontage road' or 'Airport road' is usually a good bet if you're looking for more waitresses to marry. I married a waitress who worked on Frontage (Sue from The Longbranch at 87th and I-35). See, it's true.  When we got there we discovered they changed the name to Geno's. Actually, that's not true. They changed the name to Mulvaney's Beef and Brew. I liked Geno's better and it was&nbsp;available, but I guess beef and brew is good too. We ordered drinks and the waitress carded us  after  she gave us the drinks. Burt immediately started slurping his vodka and 7up and refused to show his driver's license. Our server looked like the Michelin Man's country cousin. Her name was&nbsp;Renee or Raisin, we weren't really sure. The hand-tooled calligraphy on her name tag obscured her true identity.&nbsp;A cell phone rang. It was our friend Angie on the line from the Grand Street Café. She and some girl friends were having dinner and they wanted to know where to go for fun after their chicken sandwiches arrived. Just then, Raisin stole Burt's wallet and commandeered his Sam's club card in lieu of an I.D. She figured anybody with a Sam's club card was probably over 21. She also stole his coupon for a free "Save the Tiger" poster, good at any participating Orlando area Exxon station. This part of the story is actually a secret reference to  Seinfeld  for you George Costanza fans.  Mulvaney's featured some crappy&nbsp;décor. It was that rusty Coca-Cola sign, tattered Hollywood poster, vaguely-local sports team motif. On the way to the men's room I spied a headshot of Marilyn Monroe. It was signed, "To Mulvaney's, you have great quesadillas, Love Marilyn". I wonder how much Mulvaney's paid Marilyn for the plug. I'm no marketing wizard but I think Lupe Velez would have been better. She wasn't as over-exposed and they didn't call her the Mexican spitfire for nothing.  Like Lupe and Marilyn, this place&nbsp;was dead. Raisin begged us to stay for Karaoke but the D.J. was late. He was supposed to be there at 9pm but it was already&nbsp;9:15pm and we walked out. We pretended like it was because the guy was late. We actually always planned on leaving because the real hot spot for Karaoke was our next stop.  The Red Balloon used to be a biker bar. Now it's been totally retooled and refurbished as a biker-Karaoke bar. Some crusty dude with Willie Nelson pig-tails was signing "Turn the Page" by Bob Seger when we walked into the restaurant, strung out from the road. We could feel the eyes upon us as we were shakin' off the cold. We pretend it doesn't bother us, but we just want to explode. Not really.  The Karaoke DJ must have been deaf. He had the speaker volume cranked to the max. We actually took some Karaoke request sheets and stuffed them in our ears to dull the pain that came from listening to a drunk college kid sing Lionel Ritchie's "Three Times a Lady". Steve put a Sacagawea dollar in his ear. About thirty minutes later, Angie and her friends joined us. Unfortunately, our table was right under the speaker and we could only converse in semaphore flag signals. This worked well for those of us who remembered to bring our semaphore flags but somebody always forgets. So we hung out with the bikers and the frat boys and the Japanese tourists and waited for our turn to take the Karaoke stage. Burt and Rob chose "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" under the stage name of "Cletus and friend". Burt took the lead and Rob chimed in with some of the dialog in the first verse where Johnny is negotiating his bet with the devil, but he dropped the ball on the "Chicken in the bedpan" verse. It's a good thing they weren't on  American Idol .  We were all going deaf and we stunk like Winstons so we decided to go to Angie's house for the official "Red Balloon after-party" and de-reeking. It was after 11pm and Kansas liquor stores were closed. So we crossed the state line and bootlegged some booze! Cue the banjo music. Yankee-Bravo, Yankee-Bravo, break-break. That's semaphore flag code for "outa beer, outa here".  Later at Angie's, I drank one more beer and chatted with the girls. I even smoked a cigarette and impressed myself with some French inhaling. Don't tell my wife. She doesn't know I'm French. We stayed for an hour or so before I decided it was a good time to pilot the Windstar homeward. In the car, Steve said we should do this every month. When we got to his house, I told him I would be a good guy and wait for him to get inside before I drove away. He fumbled with his keys too long so I rolled down the window and yelled, "Screw it, you're on your own!" This good guy thing only goes so far. Let him climb in a window for chrissake.  Rob forgot his keys and had to wake up his wife to get in his house. That's the least preferred method of returning home after a nine-hour ball game rainout pub-crawl. He has an agreement with his wife about that. He wakes her up all drunk and stinking of smoke and she lets him in and washes his feet. I won't tell you what my wife called me when I got home. She confiscated my semaphore flags but she'll get over it. My only real regret was that I didn't get to sing "Brandy" by Looking Glass at the Red Balloon. We'll have to go back.

While a student at the Parsons School of Design in 1966, Vollbracht was tapped by Geoffrey Beene to assist him with the Luci Johnson wedding (daughter of Lyndon B. and Lady Bird). Among other awards, he was given the Coty award as designer of the year in 1980. He painted portraits of Elizabeth Taylor, Cher, and Joan Crawford. He appeared on television, playing himself in an episode of   urlLink Hart To Hart  . He was appointed artistic director of the Bill Blass line in 2003.

       Tomorrow is the 21st anniversary of the George Brett pine tar game. I was out of the country when it happened. I was vacationing in England. I spent three weeks in the UK and by far very few people I talked to had heard of Kansas City, although a slightly larger percentage knew about Kansas from the Wizard of Oz.   There was no internet and no USA today. Baseball scores were hard to find. American sport was not reported on the BBC. But I turned on the hotel television on night after returning from the pubs and there was George Brett,  urlLink going ballistic  in the umpire's face.   "Hey, Kansas City", I said out loud to myself.   Some other local news&nbsp;was reported&nbsp;during my stay. The  urlLink Christine Craft sexual harassment story  got some BBC attention. They even ran the KMBC news open, featuring a view of the Kansas City skyline.   "Hey, Kansas City", I said out loud to myself again.   Don't get me wrong, I didn't spend my time watching a lot of TV, but the bars generally closed at 11pm and so I was back to the hotel soon after. The four channels of the BBC usually ran programming until midnight or 1pm. The sign-off was a rousing version of "God Save the Queen" and a gentle reminder from the BBC announcer to remember to switch off your set.   One night one of the channels featured a jazz concert with Kansas City jazz master Pat Metheny. I guess that counts as a Kansas City reference. The cool thing about that hotel was that the sound and picture used different switches. Wait a minute, that's stupid. Normally it would have been annoying, but I was able to go to bed, switch off the picture, and keep the music going.   Perhaps the most personal Kansas connection I made happened in Bath, England.&nbsp;Fellow&nbsp;traveler buddy Mark Artieres and I were shooting some pool in a  urlLink pub . Mark was wearing a Kansas City Kings T-shirt and a guy approached us and asked if we were from Kansas. It turns out he was a British kid who had enrolled at KU for the fall. We exchanged info as we both were due in Lawrence too. I don't recall the guy's name, but we did meet one time after school started. There was so much happening socially for us freshman that none of us had much free time, nor did we really need to depend on each other.&nbsp; Still, it was nice to meet a Brit national who was heading to Kansas. By the way, Bath was one of my favorite stops on the UK tour. Furthermore, the brand of pool they shoot in the pubs is a bit different from standard U.S. tavern pool.   The pool table itself is much smaller than even the smallest bar job here. Also, they had rules where if you scratched or missed a shot because you hit the opponent's ball without calling it, they got an extra shot. Maybe they were pulling my leg, but that's how they played it. Other places had snooker tables, but those players were a much more serious lot.&nbsp;

       Nobody does the history of Science Fiction (SF) better than University of Kansas Professor emeritus James Gunn. An accomplished author himself, Gunn taught his history of SF English class for many years, retiring in 1993. His four volume collection,  The Road to Science Fiction  was recently reissued by Scarecrow publishing. It’s been called the best historical anthology of SF ever assembled. Gunn picked the stories and provided introductory material. It’s a ‘must have’ anthology for veteran fans and new readers alike.  &nbsp;  I took Gunn’s SF history class back in the mid 80s and was impressed. I learned that SF is a literature of change, a literature of ideas. I learned about the influence of John Campbell and his pulp magazine,  urlLink  Astounding Science Fiction  . What particularly struck me about Campbell was that as editor, he pretty much set up the rules of SF that we take for granted. He stressed things like don’t over explain new technology. Authors like Asimov and Heinlein were given early exposure by Campbell. Gunn taught me that even these giants were edited by Campbell. The lesson I learned is that if you want to be published, be prepared to update your prose. Who can argue with Campbell? The first issue of Astounding featured a classic of the genre,  Black Destroyer  by A.E. van Vogt. Written in 1939, it’s the story of a spaceship crew being stalked by a fierce, carniverous alien being. Sound familiar? Long story short according to Gunn: they settled out of court.  &nbsp;  In addition to the readings from his  Road  Series, featuring classic stories from Tom Godwin ( The Cold Equations ), Michael Bishop ( Rogue Tomato ), Harlan Ellison ( I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream ) and Ursula K. Le Guin ( The Left Hand of Darkness ), Gunn presented a series of filmed interviews (from the early 70s) with the likes of Poul Anderson, Gordon Dickson, and Harry Harrison. In a precursor to on-demand programming, Gunn challenged Dickson and Harrison to create a new story on the spot. They came up with  Lifeship . Local footnote: This series of films was captured in part by Dennis McClatchey, future husband of my favorite Shawnee Mission North teacher, Margaret McClatchey.  &nbsp;  Back to Gunn. He also showed us an  urlLink ABC movie of the week  from 1969 featuring a television adaptation of his novel  The Immortals , starring Christopher George. It was an interesting story in its own right, about a race car driver who had blood that can make people, you know, immortal. It was doubly interesting to listen to Gunn annotate the broadcast, especially where the teleplay deviated from his original story.  &nbsp;  This particular tape of the show was culled from the night it aired, so all the network bumpers, commercials and promos were included. Gunn was somewhat grumpy about the fact that the students were as interested in the vintage commercials from the original ABC broadcast as the program itself.  &nbsp;  I won’t be too harsh on Professor Gunn about any grumpiness. After all, working with undergraduates in a survey class can be an exercise in consternation. This particular course required heavy reading, and there were days in Wescoe Hall where the discussion was less than lively. Gunn’s pat comment was something like “You know, you really should&nbsp;try reading the stories before class”. He was right. When I was prepared, and I read the assignment beforehand, it was great. The composition component, a book report of sorts, allowed us to pick a classic novel from a list of recommended authors. I chose Philip K. Dick’s novel  urlLink  Ubik  .  &nbsp;  I especially like the part of  Ubik  where a meeting between the protagonist Runciter and a time-traveling spy, produces a surprising twist. The fact that the spy has time-traveling capability makes the story different by her very appearance. As if she went back in time after they met and changed something. The author makes the reader aware of the subtle change, even though Runciter remained oblivious. This particular by-product of time travel has been well documented, perhaps most notably in Ray Bradbury’s  urlLink  A Sound of Thunder  . Gunn himself features it in the novel  urlLink  Crisis   .   &nbsp;  Here’s a final Gunn anecdote and this one illustrates how well regarded he is in the SF community. I was killing some time in the DeVry library one day a few years ago and found some kind of Encyclopedia of Science Fiction on the reference shelf. It included an expansive entry on Issac Asimov, authored by, you guessed it, James Gunn.    My only regret is that I didn’t apply myself further in Gunn’s class. I skipped class. I neglected the readings. In short I missed out. Since retiring, he’s concentrated on activities at the  urlLink Center for the Study of Science Fiction , where he is the director. Check out the workshop opportunities and  urlLink recommended readings  if you’re interested. With  urlLink new funding for the center , there’s even hope&nbsp;that&nbsp;SF slackers like me might learn more.

       I was born in 1965 so my memories of the 60s are sketchy but I remember Apollo 11.&nbsp; It was wall-to-wall Walter Cronkite around our rental house on West Blvd. in Columbia, Missouri. My father tried to explain the significance of the unfolding events to my four-year old brain. After the rocket launched I ran outside to look at the moon and to watch for the&nbsp;spacecraft as it approached the cratered surface. This prompted some chuckles from the family. I returned to the living room and resigned to watch  urlLink the&nbsp;coverage  on the television, not minding the fact that all we had for viewing was a black and white set; the moon was grey anyway.

       It's rehash monday. I wrote this essay a few years ago and I recently polished it up a bit. Enjoy...    While I was at summer camp in 1978, an older friend bemoaned the fact that guys were clumsy when it came to getting her bra unhooked. This was not a symptom of the summer camp boys, but a problem she experienced year-round. During a typical make-out session on the back streets of Roeland Park or Mission, when an amorous beau rounded first base and charged hard for second, things inevitably bogged down when he tangled his mitts in the hooks and barbs of 70's-era bra construction. No front snaps existed in those days. A hook or two demanded attention before a sweaty round of "Come In Tokyo" commenced.

        urlLink      In 1982, I learned a valuable lesson at the caddy shack and it wasn’t about keeping my grip loose on a sand trap shot.   Within the social dynamics of the golf course caddy shack setting, there were your punk kid caddies looking for a loop, there were your enterprising capitalist caddies working to relieve the other caddies of the tips they earned on the course through card games and sucker bets, and there was the rarest variety of caddy: the self-actualizing adult caddy like Rusty Morales.   I’m not sure if Rusty needed the extra money or he enjoyed the exercise. I don’t why he spent his weekend mornings in the caddy shack with us high school age caddy masters and the punk kid caddies we wrangled for the country club. He arrived a little after 7am on Saturday and Sunday mornings with his round wire-rimmed glasses. He resembled Dustin Hoffman’s character in "Papillon" with his thick lenses and after carrying two fully-laden golf bags for 18 holes, he was sweating like a Devil's Island inmate too.   Rusty kept to himself and read old news magazines. Every time he came to the club, he'd bring a Time or a U.S. News tucked under his arm. These weren't a week or two past the cover date, but two or three years beyond the original publication. I knew people liked to save old National Geographic issues, but why a topical news publication?   "Rusty, what's with the barbershop mag? The cover says March 5, 1981. That was last year, man."   "It’s not old news if you haven’t read it before", he said and returned to his article.   I suspected Rusty Morales wasn’t there for the loop money or the fresh air. His answer was way too Zen for the caddy shack. The phone rang. Another golfer was waiting on the first tee for his golf bag and a caddy. When Rusty left he took his Newsweek with him.   There's an obvious point about great literature being timeless and that's certainly true. Odd that Rusty made the same point about a Newsweek magazine. They published that sucker every week whether there was any news or not. We didn't ponder the Socratic nuances of the self-actualizing caddy anyway, with all the range balls to pick up and club heads to wipe down. But every once in a while, I’d be driving around the course in a golf cart, picking up the flag sticks after sundown and I’d think about what Rusty said.   I went away to college after graduating from Shawnee Mission North. I came back in the summer and worked the busy season with the shotgun tournaments and the junior golf clinics. I don’t know what became of Rusty Morales. Maybe he finally caught up on his magazine reading. He’s gone and so is the caddy shack. They replaced it with a bigger barn for more electric carts and I hear there are fewer players these days that prefer a caddy.   * * *   Recently I found an old edition of my high school newspaper,  The Mission . It was among some things my mom found in the basement over at the house. I thought I probably kept it because my name was in it somewhere. This particular issue was the last one published by my senior class and featured coverage of prom, award ceremonies, and a feature on five teachers who were retiring.   I forgot that five instructors chose to step down that year. Between Norma Bone, Steve Davis, Fred Foreman, Dorothy Pease, and Gertrude Welch, they taught nearly 150 years at Shawnee Mission North. Miss Welch taught over 40 years by herself.   I never had Miss Welch for math. She taught the hard stuff: Calculus. I bailed on mathematics after one term of Trigonometry my senior year. But we all knew Miss Welch. She was a fixture of the upstairs hallway, busting smokers in the girls’ restroom, tip-toeing in with her slide rule and support shoes to deliver an impromptu lecture on smoking or truancy or something. I don't know what she said exactly, but us Trig slackers heard her voice all the way down in Mr. Wheaton’s room.   Last year I went back to Shawnee Mission North. The student council, with the blessing of the present administration, opened the&nbsp;doors of the ivy-covered brick building to the class of '83 on a Saturday as part of our class reunion activities. It was July 19th, 2003.   Conversations turned to Trudy Welch when we got to the math hallway upstairs.   "Did you know she started teaching at North during World War II", somebody said.   We stopped and looked in her old classroom. I spent three years at North and it seemed like an eternity. She was there for four decades. Since I didn’t take Calc, the only thing we had in common was leaving the grounds at the close of school business in 1983 and not returning that fall.   After more reminiscing about her teaching style and the pop quizzes she was famous for, the group of nostalgic 38 year-olds moved along. I spent a lot time peering in those rectangular windows on the classroom doors and lingering in front of the hallway plaques I never made time for as a boy.   It was eerie when I picked up the Kansas City Star four days later and read that Mary Gertrude Welch was dead.   Born on August 31, 1917 in Larned, Kansas. She graduated from Lawrence High School in 1935. She taught at Shawnee Mission North for 41 years. She never married. She died on July 17th, 2003 just two days before our return to the school. The cause of death wasn’t listed, but a similar notice appeared in the Lawrence paper. I think she died of old age.   It was a fitting dénouement that on a Saturday during the summer, her name echoed through the upstairs hallway one more time. In the most unlikely manner, at the most unlikely time, her spirit still pervaded the premises. But it wasn’t Welch's style to pipe down quietly. She spoke up.   In that May 13, 1983 edition of The Mission, on page 26, Miss Welch summed up her teaching career. Rusty Morales was right, its not old news if you haven't read it, and in this case, the chance discovery of my high school newspaper allowed Trudy Welch to speak again, 21 years after her retirement and a year after her death:      "My best thoughts are of the people – faculty, administration and students. Some have gone from school and achieved fame. But many are doing an exceptional job in positions of responsibility without fanfare and public acclaim.   To me, these are the important ones and I’m proud to say I have known them. Having worked with over 5000 of them, I have a lot to be proud of. Friends are the most important results of my years at SMN. I know of no other place I could have made more or better friends.   And now, back to my stained glass projects."    The teacher I never had and the caddy I barely knew conspired over the years to teach me an unexpected lesson in 2004 about the permanence of topical media and the fleeting nature of institutions.

      I know it's hot. It's summertime in America. Get outside. Go for a walk. Explore your surroundings. You never know what you might discover in your midst. If you live in New York City, you don't have to go far to find something unique. On my last visit, I marveled at the cart and buggy barns that are still in place on the ground level of certain brownstones near  urlLink Sloan-Kettering . I was amazed by a full-fledged wooden house nestled in between the rows of apartments and brownstones on the upper east side. Here's a man and a website dedicated to one of the richest urban landscapes in the world. Explore Kevin's  urlLink Forgotten NY .

      When one worked at a college radio station, you really needed to support the local music scene. At KJHK we tried to play a lot of local acts. In the mid 80s, when I was a member of the staff, the local bands sent in their music, and if it was on cassette, we'd dub it to tape cartridge. Many of the carts were vintage to say the least. Sometimes the magnetic tape inside the plastic case would break, or the tiny pads that kept the tape itself in contact with the heads inside the cart player gave away, rendering it useless. Most of the carts were 30 seconds or 60 seconds. The kind we needed for full tracks like the four and eight minute variety were harder to come by and thus replaced less often. I still remember several songs we kept in the studio that were available on cart and nowhere else at the time:     EBS "How Soon To Watch"   The Embarrassment "Patio Set"   Tommy Keene "Take Back Your Letters" and "Back to Zero"   Pedaljets "Selector"   Psychic Archie "No Pictures of Dad"    Here's a partial listing of  urlLink local acts of the day  as compiled by Don Thompson.  Other ephemeral items stored foolishly on cart and seemingly nowhere else were station IDs and public service announcements. At KJHK, we had a large collection of artist drops including Lou Reed, Bono, William Burroughs, Jello Biafra, Patti Smith, and many others. And those carts eventually just gave out. Some of them survived on cassette. I have a few that I saved that way and I suppose the future of this type of specialized media is to convert them to mp3s. So go through those old airchecks and cassettes and save the classic KJHK media moments.

      KU journalism professor John Bremner cautioned his students against trying to be cute with headline humor. He said If a joke told in private lays an egg, in display type it will drop a litter of lead zeppelins. Occasionally, an intelligent pun does precede an article, like this example:  urlLink Sneaker thief left with no rights , from the Kansas City Star (registration required).

      I was watching  urlLink One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest  this past weekend and I was intriqued by the scene where McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is interviewed by the head of the asylum, Dr. Spivey (Dean Brooks) upon arriving. Dr. Spivey's reactions and interview technique reminded me of my father. Dad worked as a resident psychologist and prof. at the KU Med Center from 1969 until his retirement a few years ago.  Surprisingly, the actor who play Dr. Spivey in the film is no actor at all. He's Dr. Dean Brooks, head of the Oregon State Hospital where the movie was filmed. According to the IMDB, the scene with Nicholson was mostly improvised. No wonder his reactions seemed genuine. In a final coincidence, Dr. Brooks graduated from the University of Kansas Medical School in 1942!

       In 1993, I got the genealogy bug. I ran with it too, spending countless hours in the North branch of the Independence, Missouri library and the National Archives outpost in Kansas City, Missouri. I poured over census records and learned how to interpret soundex file cards. I visited the Mormon LDS visitor center. It was an interesting experience and I uncovered valuable data about my family tree. I've got a lot of extended family out there. It's been very rewarding.

      Shawnee Mission North graduate David Mehnert ('83) appears tonight (8/1) as part of a story on musical savants on   urlLink 60 Minutes  . David is the founder of the  urlLink Savant Academy , a non-profit organization working with the rapidly growing community of families who have a family member with the condition. A Savant is someone who has an amazing ability that co-exists with some kind of cognitive disability. There are artistic, mathematical, and musical savants, among others.  Dustin Hoffman played a savant in  Rain Man .  In June,  urlLink Kodi Lee , a young musical savant whom David teaches, played a concert in Kansas City as part of the  urlLink Focus Families  convention. I attended the show and I found it most interesting. In addition to Kodi's musical talents, the audience consisted of many families with children who might be musical savants. Autism and many other birth defects are on the rise, but as David explains, some disabilities can actually mask miraculous talents. And these talents can be nurtured and developed, if they are noticed early on.   “60 Minutes” filmed 15 months ago, and just missed being able to tell the story about how a new form of blindness, Optic Nerve Hypoplasia (ONH), disposes to musical savant abilities in other children. I've now discovered 19 savants with the diagnosis."     After the Kodi Lee concert, as David and I were chatting, a family from Iowa came forward. Their daughter, they said, liked to play the piano. David told me later he thinks she may also be an ONH savant. It's a fascinating phenomena with more questions than answers, but one of the real benefits of Mehnert's academy is helping families who have an ONH kid discover their love for music. In many cases, these disabled kids start making progress in other areas of their lives (with motor skills and speech) after they get a keyboard to play with. Find out how  urlLink you can help .
