						        This was all written, fairly manically, late last night. I decided that paper wasn't enough for all of my craziness, so this blog was born.       "I guess it's time to start recording the emptiness. The question is, how do you record 'empty'? How do you quantify a void? There's nothing inside me. I'm just a mass of skin & blood &amp; viscera. Sounds suicidal, right? Except I'm not. I have no desire to kill myself. I just want to bleed. Cutting's a great thing. I'm glad I learned about it. Strange how those TV shows--news shows, sitcoms, dramas--they were trying to create awareness in order to help  prevent  the problem. I saw it as a new form of self-torture. Much cleaner, neater than just ripping at my skin. Acne is such an ugly condition. My solution has always been to squeeze, rip, pick, anything i could do to get rid of it. I can't let them be. I have to tear at them.        "Ok, let me start over. I'm sick. Obviously. Not just gross, but sick, truly sick. So far, after 2 sessions, the psych doc says I have depression (duh) & OCD &amp; possibly ADHD and bipolar disorder. Personally? I think he's lowballing. I've got to have more than just that wrong with me.       "I have been physically destroying myself for over half my life. As long as I can remember I've picked at scabs. There was something about it that fascinated me. How the scab came off, how if you picked it the wound bled again, how different wounds created different types of scabs, how picking the scabs off altered the wounds....It was just amazing.       "When I started getting acne, the reason for the picking changed. Acne was this horrible, ugly invader. It was something foreign that needed to be gotten rid of. So what was the obvious solution? In my diseased mind, at least, the solution was to scratch them off. Then, one time, I decided to examine a zit more closely. I got real close to the mirror, put an index finger on either side of the zit, & pressed, trying to get a closer look. Now my fascination kicked in again. I was almost mesmerized by the white substance that came out. Now I had yet another way to destroy the enemy: acne.       "How did I explain the growing scabs on my face? When it was in the first stages, my story was always that I 'fell off my bike' or some similar excuse that clearly didn't fit with the wounds on my face. As my acne spread, there really wasn't much of anything to say about it. It eventually evolved to the point where I would pick at anything that even resembled acne or blackheads. Blackheads: a new fascination. Instead of a white liquid-like substance, a dark, solid material came out when I squeezed. Amazing. Freakin' amazing.        "Now no part of my body was safe. My shoulders, upper arms, & chest all have very large pores--large pores that behave just like blackheads. These same areas later became prone to acne. For years, I hated to go out in public in a tank top. I hated people giving me those pitying looks & saying, 'oh, did you have chicken pox, dear?' It made me so mad. To this day, when people ask 'What happened to you' I simply say 'bad skin' &amp; leave it at that. I think anyone rude enough to ask doesn't deserve much of an answer, if any.       "After I got to the shaving right-of-passage that most non-tree-hugging women go through, it got worse. Ingrown hairs and irritated follicles became targets for destruction, just like acne. At some point, I started shaving my arms, too. I know partly where that came from, though; my older brother had called me 'gorilla arms' several times when I was a kid. He meant that my arms were disproportionately long (they are), but all I could see was how hairy they were. Not dark hair--it was so light that it was probably barely noticeable to others. I didn't care. It was too thick & it had to go.       "Shaving my arms only made the problem of my scars & sores more noticeable. This continued when I matured further, started having sex, &amp; started shaving my bikini area. All of it. Razor rash is a bitch. It's also yet another thing to pick at.        "It was several years ago when I first tried cutting. I had read magazine stories about it & seen TV reports about cutting &amp; it just seemed like a good way to vent. I already had been using tweezers almost daily, plucking hairs from almost anywhere I had them (except my head). Any abnormal hair--too long, too dark, ingrown--got removed. The sores & scars were even worse than those from the acne. I hated wearing shorts because of it. But I digress.       "The cutting was very timid at first. I made feeble attempts at making small--tiny, even--cuts on the side of my left thumb. I used knives from the kitchen (which weren't very sharp). Not getting any satisfaction from this form of self-destruction, I stopped cutting for several years. Suddenly, about six months ago, I started again for some reason. I can't remember exactly why. I know that I had this growing, frantic urge to find a box cutter that I had somewhere in my mess of a room & use it. First off, again, were small cuts on the side of my hand. This blade was sharper--the cuts bled. The satisfaction from this was great, a great release."       That was all from yesterday. A few hours of ranting, recorded on the WorldWideWeb. If you're not too sickened, I will be adding to this blog as a form of venting and releasing my inner, hidden self. Read with caution.
