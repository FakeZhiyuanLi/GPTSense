      WOW you're a retard.  Hopefully, someday, someone will knock some sense into you and you'll finally realize that WE AREN'T MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.  Did it really take, oh god, how many times did we go out?  I dunno but did it really take 3 years for you to realize that?  And still...  SO In*n*out is the best.  Try the french fries well-done.  Seriously.  It's like, cooked crispy potatoes.  With some salt.  And stuff.  But seriously, try it... yea...  Guys are confusing.  Could someone maybe write a book on the male species?  Or at least leave me a comment or something to help me out?  MUCH appreciated.  Thanks ^_^

      WELL now I have a journal that I'm guessing no one I don't want to see...will see.  At least I'm hoping they won't.  Eventually, they will though.  Today sucks.  If I knew it would be so fucked up, I never would've gotten out of bed.    That's it for now.  Tschus...

      WOW.  Haven't been here in a few weeks.  Thanks for the comments guys :)  I apologize for lack of updates, but I seem to have fallen for someone.  HE'S ASIAN.  And he's really hot.  My gosh...don't think I just like because of that.  He's been in my German class for the last two years and I didn't really notice him before.  He moved here from Japan before freshman year and learned English in about 8 months.  Pretty sweeet huh?  Haha, well He and I didn't become good friends until a few months ago, just before school ended.  He then asked me out but, being the uptight, prude-ish, can-never-be-too-careful girl that I am, said no.  That WHOLE day, all of his friends kept coming up to me and saying how "heartbroken" he was.  Of course I felt bad, but I hardly knew the guy...who could blame me?  I like to be careful with the guys I go out with.  I don't like having 1 week relationships and having them end with verbal fights throughout the whole next year.  I made the mistake of going out with the same guy for 11 months.  Before then, we were best friends.  But now?  HAH.  I'm not even gonna go there right now.....  So anyways, Alex [sorry if I forgot to mention his name earlier] and I have become really good friends during the past few months.  He invited to me to go to Japan with him for a week or two because he visits his family every summer.  My parents were going to let me because they thought it would be a great "cultural" experience.  But since I'm going to Alask in August, I had to renew my passport, which means that I won't get it until August 1st.  How gay is that haha.  But Alex and I have been talking so much.  It's weird...I haven't been able to talk to him [face to face] in over a month, but I like him even more than I did before I left.  I get butterflies everytime I think about him.  He's the sweetest guy I've ever met.  But a girl can't be too careful, right?  I hope so.....
