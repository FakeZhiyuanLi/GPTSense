      I have spent most of my life performing as a jazz musician . I have always had a keen interest in jazz and wanting to employ that freedom in all aspects of my life and existence . This hasnt brought me fame or fortune and has not dissapointed me in the least . I did not take this path for riches or fame and was warned from the beginning that I would probably go thru this journey without seeing either and learned that I would encounter much resistance on all sides . I started out as a drummer and advanced to mallet instruments and percussion , later on to keyboards and synthesisers .      My Goal in music was to jam in such a manner so as to re invent the music every time taking it as much as possible from one extreme to the next . that involved changing the rythym , harmony or melodic feel or groove , instrumentation , anything I could do to alter it was my modus operandi .  This approach made me quite different from my musicial peers and seperated me from listeners . When I went somewhere to play I would often be criticised for not being consistent or playing the way it was performed on record . My feeling was if it has been done that way once you can not duplicate that perfectly and that left finding my own expression within that tune and changing it to suit how I felt at that moment it should be performed . This didnt make me very popular and I didnt get invited to jam with others .      I was told by a older jazz musician that I would have to go out and create my own universe and populate it with people who shared my goals . That has not been an easy task of finding like minded people . Indeed , many in the jazz community were quite fundamentalistic in their reverence for jazz and could not accept anything outside of what they expected . I found that ironic . For me to play Bebop on a synth with a patch that did not resemble a natural instrument and to put it thru all possible contortions was only logical approach to move beyond  . Whoops ! Man did I get some people up in a knot ! Like wise when I played drums , I looked at the role of the drummer in a much more poly rythymic view . Elvin Jones referred to this as a wall of rythym . He stated that without playing the beat he felt he could enhance the solist performance by providing a much more rythmic base without playing the beat . Trust me on this , when you go to a jam session and they are playing ' Train Kept a Rollin " and you are trying to inject a 12/8 afro cuban polyrythym into the feel of the music  , you better be able to duck on a moments notice from whatever the other musicians throw at you  . If I tried to exp[lain what I was bringing to the table , they would all shake their head and look at me with a sesne of hopelessness . but they only further encouraged me not dissuaded me .  I have been doing this for 31 years and I have enjoyed all of the moments good and bad .      Jazz is very much like Zen . The more  effort you spend in trying to achieve the less likely you are to get to what you are striving for . As they would say in Zen , the moment you cease to strive and only be what is natural without the effort wil you be what you are meant to be in that moment .  Another thought on a similar motive is that the more you learn in jazz much less music in general , the more you discover how little you really do know and how far away you are from reaching those goals  . Needless to say these two themes leave little room for Ego or the Id .  If you have a preconceived notion of how you are going to execute something the more likely you are to fall short of reaching that goal .  Thelonious Monk was quoted as saying that if you weren't making any mistakes then you werent playing it right .  Many would look at those dillemmas and ask what is the point of doing it at all . The asnwer for that comes from a quote by Nelson Mandela . I may note quote this exactly so excuse me .  he stated its not  significant wheather you are recoginised for what you do , What is significant is that you do it at all .  I liked the idea of being a rebel and I liked the idea and challenge of knowing that I could never master any of this and I realised I would make alot of mistakes doing so .  To top it all off I also knew that I wasnt guaranteed anything for doing so . I liked that ! but as I continued on this journey in music , much of what I learned in this language of music was also a guidline for understanding life and functioning in life .      Today I am playing jazz as the lone steppenwolf in my community that I grew up in after having left for a journey on the road of life looking for places display my views in music . Over the years I had received much criticism for playing jazz and recieved many racist remarks and otherwise comments I will not bring in here . I receive comments from my audience from why I do not sing to why I do not play one song or another or music by one artist or another .  I am often asked to play music that is not jazz . If I play it with a jazz approach such as mine they will state that they havent never heard it that way and state their dis satisfaction with that . I  have learned not to give credence to their comments and to continue doing as I choose to do without kow towwing to their expectations .  I have people advise me that I should change my approach to make it more exciting to comment or suggestions that I dye my hair different colors or get some body piercings or tattoos or wear unusual garb to draw more attention to my persona .  Their comments and suggestions fall on deaf ears and receive lil consideration .  I have had people referred to me who were looking for a musician in their group who were more concerned about if I had the hip appearance and were not interested in my musical abilities at all .      But to be fair its not always bad remarks and criticisms . Not too long back I had a really incredible moment of extreme gratitude  bestowed up on me that humbled my soul to its trembling knees .  I had a young boy sitting in the audience about 10 or 12 years old staring intently at me . Finally in an attempt to gather my attention he came over and touched the power button on my keyboard while stating that he wanted to speak with me and that was the only way he could get me to stop . He then told me that he really liked my music and asked me many questions about my manner of playing . He asked me about jazz piano and who I thought were great Jazz pianist . so I asked him if He would come back the next time I played there and I would give him a Cd of some music by pianists that I thought were good ones to listen to . He came back and received the Cd .  A few weeks later I am playing again at the same establishment and I look up and lo and behold there is about 9 or 10 kids sitting there digging what I am doing and listening intently and even tapping along with the music . they could been out listening to a rap record or a pop star ...... But NOooooooo they were inside of a coffee house listening to an unknow jazz icinoclast torturing songs to his hearts content and they were loving it and understanding it . I am sorry , but that is the highest honor that could be bestowed upon me and that moment alone makes every effort in time worth more than all that glitters in the cosmos . Okkkkk so I am exaggerating a lil here  .  I have a right to some artistic liscense .  I wish that would happen with each person who hears me play but that form of utopia along with all others is not possible except in a perfect world .  Again Jazz teaches life . We are not put here to meet others expectations and that is not our purpose in life .  We are put here to be what we should be whether we  satisfy some ones expectations or fall short of the goal . It doesnt matter . It is selfish and immature to think that everyone is going to love us or understand us as we are all beautiful in our own existence . I think it was Michaelangelo who said that we can not understand what is beauty until we can learn to love the flaws .     Thats why I play and I accept it being called jazz or whatever . As I travel this path less travelled and gather many experiences and memories and accumulated wisdom  I become enriched with a persona of many colors and feelings  . That is what inspired me to continue , not the material benefits recieved as it is enrichment and widening of the breadth of my soul on a day to day basis . I am asked by my 87 year old father if I play so well why am I not famous and why hasnt someone discovered me .  I explain that perhaps it was not meant for me to be bestowed with those honors but that I receive my pay in other forms and that it really doesnt matter as long as I receive the joy of doing so that is all that I need for the nourishment of my soul .  but dang it ! it don't pay the bills either  . So once in a while I may need to get out and do some old fashion labor to put the food on the table and keep the electricity on . but thats worth it too !
