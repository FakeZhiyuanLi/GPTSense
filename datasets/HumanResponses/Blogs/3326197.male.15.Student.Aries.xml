Gah... dad was on the computer last night for ages and I couldn't go on! I had to spend hours lying on my bed listening to radio, and when they played a crap song, I turned the foxtel digital music channels on, and when they all went crap, I had to play my cd's, and I remembered I left my Evanescence cd in the jukebox in the front room! Ridiculous! Gah! But it's cool, I played Jet for a while, then I think I fell asleep... Teehee my nose is blocked. I love blogging. *Yawn* God i'm tired. Today i'll prolly study a bit for the exams coming up and go on my forum and watch Charmed... Yeah... I like saturday. :D Here's my friend Mel's Blog -  urlLink Click here!  , she's kewl, she's gonna do Photography like me next year! I'm cold, shivering! Meh!

      Mood: Bored  I'm bored, i'm sitting at the comp, waiting for something to happen, and I think I was supposed to do something, but I forgot what it was. Don't you hate that feeling? Today I had my English exam and Geography Exam. They were alright. I got my p.e marks back... it was I think 25 outta 30, I guess it's alright, atleast I finally beat Ian (he got 24), and yeah. It's cold. Where's Tom and Mel? We were sposta study for the big maths exam tomorrow and they aren't back yet! I watched Angel today, it was a season finale, an old one but I haven't seen it. Apparently tomorrow it shows Angel all over again from the beginning! Like, Sha! They done that with Roswell! Honestly, people! Tsk Tsk. I shall throw a Frederick J Glimmerick at you for that. I'm tired. I think I might study... now. By myself *sniff*. :(. Oh the sanity of it all (because there is no need for insanity in a place like this). Blue. Fourteen. Child. Ice cream. Indignant fried chicken. You work it out. cya. -Jay

      Hey guys. I'm alright, but I hurt my leg last week, and now it's taking its toll. Mehness. Mel and Tom were both away from school today, and Danni went home early cause she was sick. I offically dislike winter a bit, cause it's takin everyone away, and my ears have been burning alot, and I blame winter. Damn you winter, damn you. Mmmm. I got a pooload of English homework due 2morrow. owies, leg hurting. Here's a pic of my leg.  urlLink  Click here to see my pic!    Well, not really. But it would be if it was me. Meh. Silly winter. Silly Carulli. Silly Miriam. Why does this world suck? Oh no wait, it's alright, cause Charmed isn't cancelled and Robert has and is and will be at camp, so these three days r fine and dandy. Ow, leg. Meep. Fortitude. Longitude. Vanilla. Hey I had a vanilla shake last night. OMG Tina (bruno's mum) makes the niiiicest milkshakes omg. Now I want one. :(.  Sic Transit Gloria (Glory Fades) is a med song. (Skip the lyrics if you don't wanna read em but u wanna wanna read the rest of the post) Keep the noise low. She doesn't wanna blow it. Shaking head to toe while your left hand does "the show me around." Quickens your heartbeat. It beats me straight into the ground.  You don't recover from a night like this. A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless. A hand moves in the dark to a zipper. Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper, "This is so messed up."  Upon arrival the guests had all stared. Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch, unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships.  (Up the stairs: the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.)  He keeps his hands low. He doesn't wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down. His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up. But the body on the bed beckons forward and he starts growing up.  The fever, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  She hits the lights. This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth. He's gasping for air. "This is the first and last time," he says. She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like.  He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect. He whispers that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for...  (Up the stairs: the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.)  So much more than he could ever give. A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside.  The fever, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  Up the stairs: the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.  The fever, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell. Die young and save yourself. The tickle, the taste of... It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.   Still with me? Good. It's Jay, sore leg, burning ears and all. I'm fet. I shall... dundundundun lose weight! Well, i'll try. :). Yayness. Rove's on tonight. Go Rove. I'm gonna go. Ow, leg. Burn, ear. Meh, ness. Cya, - Jay.

      !!! I have neglected my poor defenceless bloggy for ages! Sorry blog. But atleast I can safely say I have a good reason - extremely busy. Going out with friends heaps and also trying to keep up with my forum and the now 3 RPG's im in which is one Charmed one and two Roswell ones, yeah I just can't seem to find time. But here I am.   Today I saw Spiderman 2. It was awesome. Then I went to Bruno's after for his birthday. It was fun.   Ooooo Mel and I are going to start recording our dreams like remembering them and writing them down. My one from last night is...   I was at school, and it was strange because it wasn't like our normal school. We were doing PE on the oval, and we had our schoolbags with us. I took a spraycan out of my bag and started spraying people. And what did the spray do, you may ask? It made their mobile phone ring, and made them answer it. Yes, that was my own minds creation. Extremely weird. So I sprayed a few people and it made their phones ring. Even funnier was that the spray also made them answer it, so they got into trouble by the teacher. Then I kept spraying Matt Grech and annoyed the hell out of him. Then suddenly I was walking home from school. Strangely, the sidewalks and streetlamps were very good looking and it seemed like they had been fixed up considerably. This was about 7pm, so it was dark. I kept walking home and then when i got about half a dozen houses away I noticed primary school kids playing in the streetlight. I kept walking home and realised there were year 11 and 12's playing in next door (my grandparents ((who weren't living there according to my dream -- there was no house)) )'s front yard in the light of a streetlamp. I kept walking 'till I got to my house and noticed my brother and his friends playing in the front yard. I walked into the house, which miraculously changed into a new great house. it was unbelievably cool, and my memories suddenly changed and I remembered we just moved here. Then I walked in and my mum had visitors. They were neighbours who were welcoming us. I said hi and went up to my new room and then...I... woke up!  Yeah...pretty weird...It's 1:30am now and i'm a bit tired and it's raining a bit. I might go to bed. Cya!
