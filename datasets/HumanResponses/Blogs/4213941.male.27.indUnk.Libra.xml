      I have friends that run the full spectrum of criminal knowledge from lawyers and police to petty crooks and white collar criminals. But this particular post is about one friend, and one friend only.  My friend Todd recently went to jail for felony shoplifting, carrying a concealed weapon, and parole violation. He's facing 5-10 years, and he's not getting out of this one easily. Is it surprising to me that he ended up in jail? No. But let's back up and i can explain the tragedy of the whole situation to you:  Todd's girlfriend Amy just got put in jail a while back for some stupid crime. Once you're put into cells at the county jail here they give you a physical. For females this physical includes a pregnancy test. Needless to say after that set up, the strip showed blue for Amy. Amy's parents wouldn't return her calls, or set her up a "store account" at the jail. For those of you with lack of experience in these things, when you are in jail you have an "account" where loved ones from "the outside" can put money in for you to buy such small niceties as ramen noodles, shower shoes etc.  Amy contacted Todd and asked if he could help her. Todd already had a warrant out for parole violation, seeing as how he never informed his P.O. that he wasn't staying at the address they had on file anymore. Todd being a little screwed up by the knowledge he was going to be a father, and that he was going back to jail until at least Dec. 12th, came up with a quick although completely stupid plan to help put money in Amy's account. He walked into Wal-Mart and walked out with a shopping cart containing multiple DVD players, a Television, and a butcher's knife stuffed in his pants. Apparently Wal-Mart store managers don't like it when you try to remove large amounts of product from the store without paying for them, and the police were called and Todd was arrested. He was charged with felony shoplifting due to the price of the items he stole, also he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon due to the butcher knife stuffed down his pants.  Todd is currently sitting in Jack State Penitentiary serving out the remainder of his original offense. On December 12th Todd will be brought back to Floyd County Jail to await trial for his new offenses.  NOW...i told you that story to tell you this one:  I saw Todd's mom sunday night when she stopped by my mom's house to inform us all how Todd was doing. Todd's mom, who will from this point on be called Bonnie, used to work for a medical facility. This was before law enforcement cracked down on medical facilities in regards to how medical waste is to be disposed, and part of Bonnie's job consisted of putting biological waste into the trunk of her car and taking it to a dump. While doing this job, Bonnie ended up contracting Hepatitis-C from the waste she had to handle on a daily basis. Bonnie overcame her hepatitis, but not before it caused her liver damage. Last year she was placed on the organ donor list to receive a new liver. So naturally every time i run into Bonnie I ask her about her health, and therein lies the tragedy.  Bonnie finally got the disability pay she'd been trying for years to acquire, however due to her disability check she now makes slightly too much income to receive Medicaid. Without Medicaid her doctor refused to see her and she was removed from the organ donor wait list. She found a new doctor who explained to her that her hepatitis has come back, her liver is now functioning at 10%, and she'll be lucky to make it through christmas. Bonnie tells me all of this and doesn't once break down crying, she has the "devil-may-care" attitude that she's always had, and i'm the one that feels like breaking down now. She tells me that Todd has written home a letter saying " I know i'm not worthy and that i've screwed up too many times, but please can you put $30 in my account, i need shower shoes", she can't afford to give him money she tells me seeing as how 3 doctor visits into this new doctor and she's already down over $2000. I happily hand over $30 to her, because i know she'd let her doctor bills slide and take care of her son first, besides it's the least i could do.  "Todd probably will be sitting in a state penitentiary the day his mother dies." This thought kept me awake most of the night sunday.  I spent a long time thinking about this sunday night and monday, so if you saw me and i wasn't in a good mood: I apologize, i had a lot on my mind.  Moral of the story? I don't guess there is one really, except maybe that there is NO such thing as "rock bottom".

      I watch really bad movies, i love them. I enjoy a really bad movie as long as it has good lines in it. In fact i have a notebook chockfull of good lines from movies, books, tv, songs etc. It's something i have been doing since i was a teen.  While i was going through a bunch of stuff that i still haven't unpacked since i moved, i found this notebook. Thumbing through it i found these lines:  "do you really want a girlfriend, or just a disease free harbor where you can park your genitals." "angst for the memories" "the bitch about growing older is you don't fall into relationships as easily as you did before you were hurt." "preservation through destruction."  All of these lines are from the cinematic abortion "Glory Daze". What a lemon this film is, but i absolutely adore it.  So i bought it this morning before i had to be at work . I need more shitty movies with great lines in them.  At the least i got a movie with an excellent soundtrack
