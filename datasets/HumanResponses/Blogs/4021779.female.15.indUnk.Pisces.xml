       wiLL--This post is all for wiLL... im sorry that i have been depressed lately i dont kno what to do about it. I love knowing that u care i really do if i knew u didnt care i would idk i would like idk what i wouldnt be as good shape as im in now....id be hell of alot worse. i Feel like u want me that u really dont want anything bad to happen to me like others wish .... i get hurt soo much and intentionally(sp) hurt me..you never hurt me on purpose i dont think there is ever a time where u did hurt me... if u did then i kno that u didnt do it on purpose or u didnt mean to. You treat me soo great and sometimes i feel like i dont deserve everything. when we broke up for that short amount of time i was ssoo upset so crushed my heart was torn iin millions of pieces and i broke up with you i knew i didnt want to but i did and i dont even know why ...i cant stand that fact that i heart you but now i just know how much u meant to me how if i werent with you id be miserable so miserable wihtout u with me... i love you way too much for anything to keep us apart no one can stop me! i just love you and i cant say it enough and i dont kno how to tell u that u do i dont know how to show u but im tryin hard as hell to but i dont kno if its enough... i dont kno i just dont...     --when im around you i feel soo special.i love knowing that your right there with me, when you hold me i wish i could stay in your arms forever, makes me feel like im yours when u kiss me on my forehead, when u move my hair from my face it makes me want to stare in your eyes, when u peck me on my cheek i get full of smiles,  whenyou wipe away my tears it lets me think u care that u want me to be happy,  when u grab my hand it makes me fell that u want me with you, when u kiss my hand i think of how sweet you are to me and in general, when u lift up my head with ur hand it lets me think that u want to see me when i feel ur fingertips lightly moving across me my head clears of everything but you when ur lips touch mine i got lost in the moment and i want everything to go on for forever... i dont know what else to say but i love you i llove you soo much... bye baby--

       Things are gettin a little bit better than how they were but not very much i still feel the same just not as much worried cuz now i kno i have someone there for me...i now have someone to to catch me when i fall to lift me up from drowing to uncover me so i can breathe... but that doesnt mean they will alwayz be there for me so im still scared im scared of what is goin to happen to me next... all i kno is things flash by me ppl that have helped me threw something such as Will Jessie Meredith Calvin.... There faces flash in my mind and its scarin me cuz i dont kno what that means but its like a 3second picture then the next person the the next and the next and its gone it goes back to the black hell of nothing...then as alwayz my head fills with crazy scary thoughts that may be true...im so scared of whats goin to happen next what will come to my mind what my actions will say what i will do what i will say im just so scared... idk all i can say is that im scared...im scared to be alone now im scared to be around ppl im scared of everything...im just soo scared... i dont kno and i wish i did! im so lost so confused i dont kno anything i get chills ... i alwayz get the chills and its not cold or ill feel extremely hot and its not even hot... i et mixed feelings about certain things i dont know anymore i just hope that i get through all this ok ..but so far im not ok... im really not idc what u think  i kno ppl are just like "oh christine shes alwayz happy shes not depressed she doesnt even kno what that means" well if u were mean id be like OMG i had no idea it was that bad! well news flash of course u dont cuz obviously u dont give a damn or u dont kno anything about me to say that im not depressed... idk what to tell you ppl! but right now i gotta go i got another post i wanna do!

          A little thing called trust but a big meaning   Trust... thats what everything is about right?   You just dont get trust you have to earn it   Just like if you were to loose it ... youd have to earn it back   But how much until you get it back   when do you know if youve done enough   why wont they give it back to me   its not fair i just want a second chance   ive prooved that i can be trusted   i gave you strong reasons    and your answer is still the same but worse   Im holding on to hope here for you to give it back   my grip isnt too strong   i can let go any minute now   i just want that trust so im holding on   please let me have it... just a second chance   I have shown that i can be trusted    i really have    so why cant i just have that second chance   and the the trust to go along with it   If it doesnt work out then its over   you can take the trust away    and my chance will be gone   let me please have that trust   and the chance that i need

        Does everything have to be a competition   Seems like most things are to you    you win you win you win again     i really dont care    its what i think not you   Every little thing in life is takin to the extreme   all you want is to win   to prove your better and that im less   go ahead do that    its what i think not you   I have my values    you have yours   of course yours have to be better   which doesnt matter   its what i think not you   My life is great   so is yours   but yours is better   mine is just there   its what i think not you
