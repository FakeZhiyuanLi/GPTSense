       I don't know what's up with me. But, for some reason I can't get out of this funk. At work, I only do what I need to get by. At home, I don't answer the phone. Clean my house, have a drink and veg out in front of the TV. I know I should go work out, but don't have the energy to do it. It's only across the parking lot from me! This is how lazy I am! I know it would make me feel better, look better and it's free. I'm tired all of the time and just want to sleep. I'm already on prozac, and have upped my prescription once already this year! Haven't been to the shrink in awhile, but I don't think she was doing anything for me anymore. But, listening to my stories. She use to recommend self help books, now she recommends trashy novels with characters that do things I would do! Yeah...I wasn't looking for another gal pal!  Let's see, my 3 biggest stresses are...   Bills/debt:   I can't get ahead! I've cut way back on spending money and still, can't get ahead! I guess it's because I am still not use to having to pay rent! I haven't had to for the past 5 years. I'm pretty much use to spending what I want, when I want! On stupid shit! No more stupid shit for me, which sucks!! I haven't bought a new pair of shoes since April! And, I'm use to buying at least one pair a week! Thinking about getting a part time job during the holidays.   Weight Issues:   If I were to spend more time working out, I would look better, feel better, sleep better etc. I know all of that, I just am having a hard time finding the motivation to get off my ass and do it! I thought about doing something childish like giving my self a star when I work out, and when I get 20 stars, getting a pedicure or something like that! Then, that brings me back to issue #1 and being stressed about debt!   Friends:   I've lost touch with some of my friends since the "break-up".  There is a whole group that were "his" friends and a group that were/are mine. Here's the thing...most of my friends are married! Which was fine when I was in a relationship and thought that I was in a similar place as my married friends. Now, I find that I don't have as much interest in looking at toys, baby clothes, talking about child birth, their kids etc. Not to mention feel like a 3rd wheel when doing things with them, or the fucking nanny. Now that I'm single, I realize that I have very few friends that are single too! Which is a bit depressing!     I guess I'm just feeling alone and sorry for myself. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better and brighter day!

          Why do I feel like I didn't get a weekend?  I didn't do a damn thing all weekend. Left the house 2 times, didn't answer the phone or call anyone. Which really isn't like me. I guess I needed a break! Today, I feel like I could sleep for the rest of the week. I need to work out, take drugs or something!  The ex was suppose to come by this weekend and drop off the rest of my shit. I ignored the phone when he called. Didn't feel like dealing with him or being nice. After all, do you know how many times I had to wait on his ass for a call returned? Lots! Let the bastard think I was "to busy".  Didn't hear from the "F.B." this weekend. Left him one message on Saturday night. His phone was turned off..hmmm...Suspicious! I think he started a new job today, so I'm taking bets on when I will hear from him again...I'm going with Wednesday (of which week, I'm not sure)

           Is he just a fuck buddy or is this going somewhere?   Okay...a little history! Just got out of an 8 year relationship that ended in January. Lived together for 4 years. He just kind of decided he wasn't happy and hadn't been for the past year. Nice of him to let me know huh! Was devastated for about a month, cried a lot, drank a lot, then got my shit together, moved out and moved on. Realizing that it would have never worked out in the long run, it was a blessing in disguise and all of that other crap!  So then...Meet a guy at a bar in May (I know, never a good sign.) Gave him my number, he called the next week. Talked for awhile, we both had plans to be out of town the next 3-4 weekends. Decided to get together when we were both back in town. In the meantime, I'm close to his house, at a bar, call him up around midnight and he comes to meet me for a drink. Gave me a little smooch good bye. Don't hear from him for awhile, then he calls, wants to get together, we go for a drink, we go back to my place, fool around and well....you know! I have to say I didn't regret a single moment of it. So, we're suppose to go out the following weekend, I don't hear from him. Left him the "what is up with you?" message. Hear from him again the following week, I ask if we are done here ior what. He says not at all, blah blah blah, I cave and ask him to come over. Do you see a pattern forming here? So, I don't hear from him for 3 weeks...just when I've decided to completely write him off and delete his number from my cell phone. He calls!!! Says he's been out of town for 3 weeks, coming home tonight, let's get together soon. So, we go out to dinner a few nights later, have lots of drinks, come back to my place, open a bottle of wine and well...you know! We both go out town the following weekend, (not together), he calls when he gets back and stays over.  Here is the thing. I do like him, but really don't know  him  all that well, or what his deal is. We get along great, are very attracted to each other, are totally comfortable with each other, which we both admitted was a little creepy.   He says he's a very "private" person, which I interpret as "a lying, cheating, sneaky bastard." I found myself actually trying to catch him in lies. (I think because my ex use to lie about stupid shit all the time.) But, I was not successful! Which you would think would be a good sign, but it just confuses me.
