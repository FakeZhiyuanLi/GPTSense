      I'm a gamer, but I got sick of video games after high school.&nbsp; I play real games: chess and go.&nbsp; Or maybe I should say go and chess (the occasional game of checkers is cool, too).&nbsp; But go is my true love (well, Marylou is my true love, but we're talking about games here!).&nbsp; I only play chess because it's easier to find people who play chess than go.&nbsp; But listen, go is the best game in the world.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it is beautiful.&nbsp; Two players take turns placing a single stone of their color (black or white) on the board.&nbsp; Stones are captured when they are surrounded.&nbsp; Whoever controls more space at the end of the game wins.&nbsp; The rules are incredibly simple, yet even the best computers can't play it worth a darn.&nbsp; That's because it is deeply strategic (as opposed to chess which is deeply tactical).&nbsp; The richness of the game and the simplicity of its elements makes it beautiful.&nbsp; Dont' take my word for it.&nbsp;  urlLink Play it yourself!

      I'm currently working on a pair of lace socks for my 3 year old daughter, Gabriella.&nbsp; I made her some basic ribbed socks about a year ago, but she has pretty much outgrown them.&nbsp; I guess we'll give them to Maya (my 5 month old) now! &nbsp;  Gabriella's socks (July 2004)  Yarn: Fortissima Colori, Socka Color (75% superwash wool, 25% polyamide) in a self-patterning, variegated (red, yellow, orange, brown, green, blue&nbsp;colorway) Needles: Dual Addi turbo circulars in size 2 (for ribbing) and 3. Pattern: Shell Lace socks from page 16 of the XRX Socks, Socks, Socks book. Picture: coming soon! &nbsp; In addition to those socks, I started making a vest for Gabby based on an idea I saw in the Summer 2004 Knitter's magazine.&nbsp; Squared up entrelac.&nbsp; Worked back and forth diagonally on straight needles, I made little squares which are connected at the corners.&nbsp; A picture will really help here.&nbsp; Anyway, I made the front, but it looks to be a little big, plus she doesn't need a vest right now with local temperatures pushing 100F, so it's on the back burner...

      Yes, I'm a knitter.&nbsp; Yes, I'm also a guy.&nbsp; Don't knock it -- knitting gives me something to do when there is time to kill -- on the train, waiting at the dentist/doctor, or when watching TV just isn't sufficiently stimulating.&nbsp; More that that, though, knitting provides everything I need to stay sane.&nbsp; First, there are the left-brain techniques of knitting&nbsp; -- there's&nbsp; a lot more to it than knit and purl, let me tell you.&nbsp; Lace knitting is particularly fascinating to me right now -- the tension of increases and decreases combine with the slack from yarn overs to balance out creating complex, yet regular textures.&nbsp; Second, when the pattern is mastered, the simple, repetive physical motions of its execution induce a calming, meditative state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a great sense of satisfaction from having created something -- a hat, scarf, sweater, socks -- from just needles and a ball of yarn.&nbsp; Not only that, but it provides a very tangible connection to garment making now and in the past.&nbsp; I am certainly more aware and appreciative of the clothes we have available to us, especially the products of handknitters.&nbsp; Lastly, there is the ultimate pleasure of giving a gift which you have carefully, lovingly, and often arduously crafted with your own two hands.&nbsp; I feel that I am truly giving a piece of myself to someone when I give them a knitted gift.

      Okay, let's just get this out of the way.&nbsp; I am a Software Engineer.&nbsp; My high school math teacher always told me not to become a programmer because it would rot my mind.&nbsp; Well...perhaps he was right, but I manage to maintain a fair amount of variety in my work, so I'm not completely brain-dead yet.&nbsp; Besides, I play Go and Chess to keep the 'ol brain whirring.&nbsp; Currently I am responsible for both 1) maintaining the Software department web site, which keeps me up on HTML/CSS, ASP, databases and such things, as well as 2) porting our primary software product to work with newer, better compilers.&nbsp; Currently I've been using Microsoft Visual C++ 7. &nbsp; My day generally goes something like this: get up at 5:30 to catch the train from Tracy (in the central valley) to San Jose.&nbsp; Arrive at work at 7:30 and press a few buttons on the computer.&nbsp; Ponder a deeply cryptic error message elicited by the latest compiler for a few hours.&nbsp; Try a bunch of things to get the error to go away.&nbsp; Of course, nothing works.&nbsp; Go to lunch for an hour -- maybe play some chess with a friend -- then stare at the error some more.&nbsp; Give up and enhance the intranet with some nifty new features, answer a few emails.&nbsp; About 3:30, try one last thing to get rid of that error message...voila!&nbsp; Solved.&nbsp; 4pm: go catch the train home.&nbsp; Of course, not every day is like this -- only the good ones.&nbsp; Sometimes I don't solve the problem until the next day (or the next week). &nbsp; Despite the dryness of the work, it does contain an occasional gem of a problem whose solution is frustratingly difficult to determine, but, when solved, provides an immense sense of satisfaction.&nbsp; Yeah, it's a good job.

      Well, I have finally succumbed -- I'm a blogger.&nbsp; Mainly, I want a place to store my thoughts and experiences related to knitting, but I'm sure other stuff will creep in.&nbsp; In fact, I hope my parents, children, friends and relatives will enjoy browsing what is effectively a public diary.&nbsp; If there is something you would like to see here,  urlLink drop me an e-mail !
