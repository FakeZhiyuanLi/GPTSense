      Alright, so I was a little drunk last night and a little harsh.  But its true.  Ok , on the real, heres Brians logic @ the bar.    1. Get drunk as you can off of no money and other people.  2. Sulk and pout until you get people to buy you beer.  3. See dyke/fake punk/hipster girl that you are in love w/ but ditched you for another guy that got her pregnant. 4. Sulk some more about that. 5. Tell friends of YEARS to scram because you want to talk to her.  6. Ditch same friends for same bitch.    I dont see the logic kids, im tired of putting up w/ so called friends that ditch their friends for nasty bitches that theyve known for a month just cause they think their in love.  Its becoming a pattern. Spring is over , the blossoming is done! BITCHES!!  CALL ME AN ASSHOLE SEE HOW MUCH I GIVE A SHIT! Think about the consequences of your actions world! Later  PS thank you brad for the comment.  I cant believe someone really was reading this crap!

      Im tired of today. All i did @ work today was medialog and fall asleep @ the medialog station. Sucked. Then i practiced a new song with Threefold. A good song but I was having trouble learning it.  I guess ive never been in a band w/ more than 1 good guitarist. Maybe i cant cut the mustard.  I would totally understand if they said it wasnt working out with me. I feel like I suck.  I need practice.  I need a practice space! Word.  i havent played drums for 2 months and havent played in a band for 6. I guess I kinda leaped into this without looking.  We played @ a guy in the bands name Terry's house again tonight.  Which means we only have an hour , which sucks cause I usually learn about 3/4 of the song and then we have to go. I was having trouble w/ the changing parts of the song but I think with repetition I could get it.  So on the way home Rory from threefold was giving me a ride and his buddy from Allister calls up, who he worships (seems like) and they proceed to have boyfriend/girlfriend type talk on the phone! I coulda sworn he was talking to a girl?? This was weird, i felt like i should plugged my ears to make him more comfortable talking about his closet gay lover from the Drive Thru records band Allister a (Pop punk shit band riding on the wave of New Found Glory that got lucky because the label took off) So anyways, i offered for him to drop me off @ the blue line and he could go meet up with his boyfriend sooner.  So i did and i had to ride all the way back downtown then up north to my place, the whole thing took about an hour.  Then i had to go to Nick's Uptown and meet my friend Brian for his kinda going away party.  This was horrible. First of all I meet my friend Dan there @ 12 am and we go in and see brian walking along doing his best im depressed look.  Then as usual hes like , hey guys wanna buy me a beer.  So were sitting there and this beast of a girl comes up and is like buy me a shot I just graduated!! Im like no , buy me a shot bitch!  Apparently one of Brians friends wifes.  What the hell makes me think i would buy you a shot cause your a dumb annoying bitch that graduated. Good now get a job ya free loading DYKE! Lord she wasnt even good looking! Then she has the nerve to come up and say , buy my friend a shot! SHELL SHOW YOU HER TITS! As if i wanna see this broken down bitches saggy flop titties. Lord i hate Chicago girls, most of the time.  ANd to top it off I DONT KNOW YOU!! FuCK!    So anyway , Brian tells me this story about this dumb bitch hes been making out with breaking his heart.  She dumped him and lost her V to some other dweeb and got pregnant .. WOw.  So brians all down and says hes gonna go home after we buy him another beer and ask her to watch a movie. So where did brian go , its just me and dan sitting there. We wonder around find him in the corner sulking.  I say whats up and he says,WIll someone please buy me another beer?? So im like is that gonna help brian?? Is that gonna help your fake alcoholism.  so then the dyke bitch that he like comes up and he tells us to scram.  So im like im leaving.  Me and Dan walk up to the el and were talking across the EL tracks cause he has to go an opposite way.   His comes first and I wait.  I get to Belmont wehre i have to transfer to the Brown line. SO i get on the brown line and what does it do ! GO THE FUCKING OPPOSITE WAYT!! FUCK! So i waited for another brown line going back and i think i can just ride it to Diversey, NO The fucking this stops @ Belmont and goes back!! FUCK ME! SO i get off and spenmd my laast 2.50 on a cab ride. This city is sucking lately and its not givin up till it gets 50 gallons!!

      Those are lyrics by a great band which I have liked now for about 2 years named Coheed and Cambria. They are a really really good rock band. Not a punk rock band, not a hardcore band like the usual dumb bands that I like these days.  NO nO you might say they are punk! Nope they arent sorry, they are just in that category for some reason.  They really sound like a more powerful and aggressive Rush which is also another great band with a great drummer.  Well yeah, Rush is cool , I admitted it, yeah so what!!? Neil Pert for example is suberb.  Anyways, what am i talking about.  Bottom line i recomend getting some Coheed and Cambria for anyone that likes great rock music.    Sorry I havent written in the past coupla days but i feel ive been exausted and busy.  This week has left me with question marks and what ifs @ work and what I am going to be doing in the next coming months.  My boss is taking another position within the company.  She just graduated w/ a masters degree and shes getting promoted and she deserves it.  I feel flattered that I am one of the 2 people @ work that she invited to her party. Although I dont think I can make it cause of my parents and grandparents are coming this weekend.  Oh how the weekends are sacred, especially 3 day ones.  Anyway, I went to the White Sox game w/ some friends last night.  We sat in the bleachers and witnessed several dumb CUBS Vs Sox fightts which is stupid because both teams lost last night.  Drunk douchebags are very intolerable.  My tolerance for douschebags is at an all time low these days.   i just cant stand to be around meat heads, pretty boys and snobs or people that are on their cell phones way too much. Especially while using public transportation. SO what else Im getting hugely fat and bloaded looking.  somethings go to give, i must sign up for a fitness place.  My sister says I can have her Bally's pass but I have to wait till she signs up somewhere else.  Im tired of waiting. Im gonna be like my dad in no time.  Tonight i played some baseball practice badly and went and drank and ate and watched the cubs. I practice again tommorow w/ threefold.  I havent been practiciing the songs that much.. ehh im gonna suck.  Lord , im tired, i will write more tommorow when I have time of whats been happening.  ALright see you then .

      Wow , what a crazy weekend.  Friday I got off early from work w/  a coworker and went to a bar & met up w/ friends and started drinking & got so drunk that I was in by 10:30. I must be getting oldy. Then saturday I went back to B-Town for my friend Paul's graduation party.  It was pretty cool. Alright well i just got a call, gotta MEDIA LOG! Peace nedry

      YEAH RIGHT! My friend Dave, who is married and I never see anymore, called me last night and said that there is a rumor going around between my friends Mom's that I am engaged to Miranda. Haha thats hilarious. How would I of all people be getting engaged. Why would I throw my life down the shitter @ such an early age. No way Jose.  I think they are confused w/ my SISTER Stephanie who is 28 and is engaged and will be married in about a year , if all goes as planned.  I dont think she wants to get married. She still has some life left in her and she knows that. She doesnt want to waste her young life catering to the beck and call or having someone do likewise to her yet.  But ahh maybe she is. I like her fiance, hes cool.  Anyways, I rehearsed w/ Threefold last night and to me, it was nothing less than embarrassing.  My arms were getting tired so fast and they started off on a song that I hadnt heard before rather than a song that I was listening to already and learning already. But I think I did considering my low low and dwindling brian capacity.  I like their music though, its cool and rocking and get this! These guys actually know how to play guitar!!! WHAT! Maybe im the shitty one now! Thats scary .  Shit , I have a huge lame O staff meeting right now, Narly!@ Alright gotta go peace

      Sos I had to go to Michigan City again.  My bitch boss made me drive again cause I had to fix other peoples mistakes again.  And she tried to blame it on me.    God, I cant wait till I dont have this damn job anymore.  It blows ass sometimes.  But I guess Im lucky to have it.  I love that darkness track growing on me its pretty cool.  And I try out for that band tommorow.  I wonder what that will be like.  Anywho, check out www.threefoldrock.com to see what its all about.  I was supposed to go bowling tonight but that didnt happen.  Narly. Anywho, i dont feel like writing much tonight, i might get off work early tommorow night.

      I might be joining a new band.. Prolly not, I hate sara and will never see her again, thank god. It truly is gods work and help that that is so.  All I can say is thank god its over for good. I will truly never put any effort into contacting or seeing her again, only my mind can do the rest and thats healing like a slow wound. In other news I met some dudes in a band that met me through a drunkin email that said i play drums. They are called Threefold and are kind of an Alkaline Trio sounding band out of the Chi Burbs. Anywho, itd be fun. Dont cross your fingers. I want to play music for the rest of my days and I hope it comes true somehow.  I went to this expensive bar with my friend Dan tonight so im kinda buzzin! that makes for e blogs.  Which is weird. I wonder if anyone besides me is reading this. ??  See you tommorow sweet dog.

      Well , I had a great weekend.  Miranda got here around 8 on Friday and then we uhh, then we drank some wine and went to Cesar's then we went home watched this funny movie called Dummie.  Hilarious & Weird just like I like.  Anyways then we went to bed! Yesterday we got up to go to my softball game , but it was cancelled cause the field was wet so we played with chester in the park and saw these amazing tumblers people doin flips and what not crazy like.  Then we came back in went to see Supersize me for 20.00 for 2 tickets good lawd.  Then dinner @ this amazing restaurant called...I dunno what it was called but then we went to the TOnic Room and partied then went home to sleep.  It was a quiet cool weekend and it was nice to see mirma.  shes cute.  alright I think i might see Preacher Gone to Texas tonight. Hopefully Troy calls me to go. Aeight peace. Later

      So, work today it kinda went fast!  Great.  But it still sucked cause i had to medialog all day which was mindnumbing to say the least.  And yesterday I had to factcheck all this stuff and put it in a binder and it took hours.  I did it PERFECTLY but wouldnt you know it John comes up stairs and says hey Nic I gotta talk to you. Sos Im like shit.So i explained to him exactly what I did and he said hmm, thats right. But i reminded him that I had the intern help me out on the last part of it cause Rob Smart had me do some crucial medialogging for MJ12 so I passed it off to FAGGOT Ken's lil puppet Jason. Hes actually pretty cool though.  Turns out he did it right too so who is to blame.  PROBABLY RICK but he wont admit to that cause his head is actually a penis. Ill get more into that later on in my blog.  But my hands hurt. So anyways, I gotta learn how to put pictures up on here.  thatd be fun. Anywho, tell me if your reading this! Peace and lovely!

      So wow, how is my life going these Days?? I have never hated it nor myself (sometimes)more in years. Ahh, thats the mogwai & booze/weed talking.  I think I literally shit out my fucking liver.  Sorry for all the cussing people but, ahh thats life and chicago talk.  Which is a cool accent and I hope to gain one soon! NarlKill!  Speaking of narlkill my pal Troy called me tonight for some of that good golden soda.  I am totally out of money since my doc appointment. Sucks huh.  Anywho, well my job kinda sucks cause i feel im getting treated as an Iraqi POW right now. Owoooo that was abad joke , but fuck it and fuck GEORGE DUBYA! Fucking sister fucking communist!! He needs to go now or else this whole frozen nation is going to be one huge pressure cooker!  Anywho, I wonder if anyone will read this. I doubt it, I remember reading my old roomate Brookes blog.  She was really personal sometimes.  Should I be personal, should I risk hurting the ones i Love! I must, i must put more of myself on the line.  I already have it all out there anyway with this crazy ride.  So I miss my dog Chester.  I left him with Mom & Dad for the week cause Miranda will be coming up to Chicago this weekend with him.  I Figure its a good Mom's day gift for my mom whom I love very much! I wish I could find a girl like her for serious! Im not a fraid to say it. And Dad's awesome most of the time too! Anyway my Friend Dan put all these cool albums on an MP3 cd so i have like 4 mogwai albums , and some nick drake and mos def, sweet.  I hope he put handsome boy modeling school on there too.  Anyway , Brian came over too and we yes, ended up smoking reeffer and drinking WAY Old beers.  Then we went to 7-11 and got some shit food and then we saw a dunkin donuts so we went there too and i ate 2 jelly rolls and on the way home talkng to miranda I felt a lump of shit comin on, oh boy was it comin, I think there were turds forming in my throat it was so bad.  LORD! So i had 5 blocks to go since i was off the el.  Now 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 and finally darvees was there to open the door for me on the home stretch then i came in flipped on the AC and VIOLATED the porcelean like it was my only desire....which it was.  I thiink  i puked out my ass.  So anyway that was a fun story. No more bad junk food  I am getting fat, i cant get fat like my dad.  I neeed to stay in shape and hit the weights hard! Gotta not get back to my pussy status. Anyway, I hate that bitch sara, she called yesterday and did her classic "Oh, I got another call, can I call you back things" and I never hear from her.. Its just rude.  I think were almost for sure done talking now, this tired romance is crawling to its grave. OR what was one, but why cant I forget her. Lord.  shes so wrong. She ruined a perfectly cool city for my though in the ashes.   BITCH! Aww wha tam i kidding. wha ta loser i prolly was to her.  So anywho, getting paid tommorow! Word! Word, my fingers hurt, ganight.

      Hello everyone,  I just got back home from taking a table out to Aurora w/ Dan G.  Guess who was there, her boyfriend it was kinda awkward/funny.   Hes very quiet and a farmer which is weird because we were 2 very different type of people.  Not that that matters or anything but it was just weird.  I am drinking water right now. . goood, not beer.  Jeez i drink too much.  what else...ughh Friday went out w/ work peeps for a lil bit then met up w/ Troy, nagger, pete and some sluts.  Got wasted w/ this hot girl @ work that wears way to much makeup, we call her Cake Face, cause her makeup is like cake icing. NARLY! Then saturday I had to leave poor Chester Copperpot the Saxophonist @ home for a night because I went out to Mike's girlfriend Karly's grad party.  It was neat, got to go swimming/drinking/bonfire/act dumb around good buds.  I miss hanging out with all them peeps. Got narkill mosquito bites though.  Ahh well something to do at work.   Cubs win! 15 innings.  Geeze they blow their leads and give me a heartattack.  I totally dont think they are gonna get the pennant this year either.  Too squirrly, maybe when Salsa gets back theyll do better.  Maybe hell strike out like usual. im listening to a PARK cd troy gave me, thanks Troy yer kickass. I dont have any fucking dough again till Tuesday, and to think 2 weeks ago I had over a thousand, seriously this city will eat your soul and then pee on you. PEEEEEE.  One more try....one more goodnight.  All this emo punk music makes me think of SR i should listen to the Police again they always make me happy. "Your busy fucking everyone"-thats provocative. Chester is sleeping soundly , he got a lot of exercise outside today and thats great cause hes a growing boy and needs it. Hes cute as hell and no matter how many important documents he chews up I will still love him.  Hell just look into my eyes and Ill hear it, "Im sorry Sensei, I was bored" he'll say and ill say "Its ok Little Nudgu, I forgive you for what youve done today, just try to learn from mistakes". Cold ass water feels orgasmic trickling down my throat.  Wow, that was gay.....ugh im getting weird and tired, do I vent more or do I go to bed.  Bed it is friends.  Until next time.   Love,  Bob Seger

      Word, whats up bitches.. I just got home from a shoot for Storm Stories on the Weather Channel , the most highly rated show that Towers Productions makes right now.  Anywho, I got to play a guy that saved his fiance's life when a boat got capsized in Baltamore.  So the story goes, they were riding a ferry, big storm comes up , boat over turns 7 people die my charactor and his fiance make it out alive because they open a boat window.   So today we were shooting @ this scuba diving practice facility which was pretty badass.  They had tons of visible fish swimming everywhere. 1 touched my ass! It was narl! Anywho, they rigged this window underwater and me and this other chick from work had to swim through it a bunch of times in a panicked manner.  It was kinda deep, and kinda made me nervous.  The rest of the crew were in full scuba gear w/ oxygen and me and this other poor receptionist had no air and had to do like a 20 sec scene underwater over and over again.  But it was cool .  I had a wetsuit on at least w/ clothes over it. I cant wait to see it, me panicking to and fro all over the place.  Ill let all you people know when its on.  Anywho, got wasted last night cause my friend my buddy Kristin @ work knows a bartender at some cool downtown place and we got loaded after band practice.  Lots of fun and her roomates her hot. Anywho, I smell like a pond and im takn a shower and goin to bed.  Peace!

      So anyways, hows it goin.  I think people are reading this thing.  Its weird , ill call up a friend and they know something that I havent told them.  Kinda a weird feeling.  But thats cool.  I guess everyones growing up , getting jobs and moving away from each other so this is a good form of catching up w/ people.  Super! Try a ham sandwich.  I have been rehearsing w/ Threefold @ our new practice space the past 3 days and it has been exhausting/frustrating/fun.  I think learning someone else's songs w/ the drum tracks already written out has been one of the most difficult things.  Rory, the drummer turned guitarist in Threefold is very picky about drum parts and every detail has to be precise and perfect. Which is Narly and good @ the same time.  Good because hes a perfectionist and perfectionism means better band. Bad because I dont get to add little bits of creativity and opinion.  Maybe thats a good thing.  So yeah I only have 2 more songs to learn on their upcoming EP so that should be enough songs to play shows w/ for now.  Its been great though and the guys have been super understanding about the whole thing.  I have a narly blister on my thumb from it all though.   Anywho, I havent been hanging out w/ Berndt , Jesse or Torre for a long time now.  I think thats gonna be the norm, I dont think those guys and I see on eye to eye much anyway.  Work, is work and its getting less and less important in my life and the band is getting more important.  I knew that owuld happen , ive been up till 2 each night this week and I think it shows.   I called my ex girlfriend Allison last night nad wished her a happy 21st b-day. So weird that that little one is finally 21. I remember when i met her she was 15.  Narkill. She was drunk last night and I wished her happy b-day b4 her boyfriend did. HAHA!! She was impressed, brownie points for sho. Im going to see Piebald, Spitalfield, The Format and the Jealous sound tonight and im excited.  Ive been wanting to see Spitalfield for a little while now and Im excited to see Piebald and the Format as well.  Shout out to Brad @ www.bradicalmindspew.com.  Hes got a cool blog and its fun.   I was listening to Howard Stern this morning and this disgusting foul pieces of shit excuses for human were on the show today. I was so pissed the more I listened.  They had this who wants to win johns job thing and this awful couple came in like white trash new york assholes.  giving there kids crack and bragging about how they got so much money when her husband died in 9/11.  Fuck NEW YORK Quidos! Gotta go bye

      The new taking back sunday is going to make that band bigger than anything ever in the world , as far as bands go.  Holy shit, i just listened to that on the leak and its freaken cool.  Not raw like the first one, its pretty produced which is bad but really sounds good like they have matured a lot.  The drumming is a lot more tech also.  The guitars are the same but I think that the drumming has stepped up 1 notch on the skill level.  He already was a rad drummer to begin with , who can forget Cute w/o the E" not best of all time though.  Anyways, its making my friends job a lot more exciting @ victory records ill tell you that much.  and ill also tell you that even though he works long ass hours, im still fucking jealous of his tight assed, interesting job, youknowhaimsaying! word.  nigga. b bigga. Damn bottom hose: TBS dont ruin the ride by selling out??!?!??! SelLLing is not just a myth people its about music quality!! Word. out

Kinda weird having a roomate again, but its fun, I drink a lot more and get work on time more.  Chester is liking it too.  He (Paul) is moving next Tuesday though to his new place downtown with his G/F.   I am jealous of his job @ Victory damnit i want a cool job! Wheres my cool job!  Anyways, John came up last weekend, it was so fun, we partied hard and went to the Cubs game on Saturday then partied some more.  Narly.   Im so stoked about this upcoming weekend.  Im going to Avoca, IA for a barn bash were I will be playing in a experimental band as well as a hardcore/art rock band.  Pretty weird huh.  Miranda's coming too! What a gas!! Work sucks more than ever, I am now 2 peoples bitches.  Great. Thats all I will say about that.   What else, Threefold is working on getting shows lined up.  This dude from Trustkill records keeps emailing me and asking me to set up shows in IA for the Lyndsay Diaries and Long Since Forgotten.  What the hell does he think I can get him shows for?  Yeah right, set up your own damn shows fool! Its hard enough setting up shows for my own band, who the hell does he think he is.  I will just drop everything like a bitch cause this guy flashes some bigger band names around , fuck that , do it yourself.  Anyway, tons of hot chicks @ work kinda distracting sometimes.  Alright, ill talk to yas later.  Hope your doing finE!    Abbey Bernstein

      Hey people, im really sorry I havent blogged lately.  Anywho, whats up?  Long time no blog.  Lets recap about a weekend.  Friday, got drunk w/ friends and passed out at Jenn Longo's/Berndt's place. Troy and Katie hooked up! Weird.   Then Saturday went to Streator to see my G & G Dell's place for the last time ever. Really sad and its an end of an era.  Set off a punch of fireworks in the parkng lot.  That was a lot of fun, really like old times and I guess a good send off to an era.  My Dad and Uncle Pete got drunk.   Sunday, went to Cherry, IL to my 2nd Uncle Tony's house.  They have a pool and it was fun. Left @ 4:30 thinking I was gonna be able to go to the CUbs game w/ Russ and meet up with 2 cousins but Russ's dumb sister gave the tickets away.  Sucked.  So Russ and I went to a new bar called  Casey Moran's and drank and watched the good game . Cubs win over Sox 2-1 . Then we went to Barley Corn to meet with Russ's sister and her douchebag 35 year old friends who are so into thinking their rich its gross and quido like.  Anyway my cousins Ryan and Steve Dell met up with us and we talked about sad stories and it was a bummer.  I didnt really want to be there , but I guess I wont be talking to them as much as usual anymore.   Practiced on Monday with Terry and got an old Threefold song down.  I think that makes it 7 or 8 songs that I know.  Im not sure. Im getting excited to play some show and im getting broker because our bassist whove ive met once is broke and wont pay for the space.  That sucks.  Im broke too and I have bills to pay.  I need to learn the songs better too. That bitch Sara called today too, mustve been really bored or something.  Tonight I watched Duplex a lil dumb but funny.  Typical Danny Devito movie.  Anyway , gotta go to bed. Ill talk to you later.    Nic
