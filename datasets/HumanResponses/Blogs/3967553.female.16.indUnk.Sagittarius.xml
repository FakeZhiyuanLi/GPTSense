      I didn't go to sleep until 5 o' clock this morning.&nbsp; I don't know why, but I just wasn't all that tired.&nbsp; Staying up that late did prove to be semi-productive.&nbsp; I e-mailed some people that I haven't talked to in a while.&nbsp; I even wrote some song lyrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're not all that great, but it was how I felt at the time.&nbsp; When I finally did go to sleep, it was wonderfully blissful.&nbsp; I only got 5 hours of sleep, but what sleep I did get was absolutely wonderful.&nbsp; My mom is beginning to think that I have insomnia...I'm not so sure I disagree anymore.&nbsp; The earliest I've gone to bed since Thursday was 3:30 AM.&nbsp; Oh well...if I'm an insomniac, then I'm an insomniac.&nbsp; I'd be the reason that the drug companies discovered sleep aids.&nbsp; Then again, I've had a lot on my mind lately, so that might be why I haven't been sleeping all that well lately.&nbsp; Update on yesterday's posting: My "sister" is off the respirator and she'll be out of intensive care (hopefully) tomorrow.&nbsp; Maybe now that I won't be so worried about her, I'll get some more sleep tonight...maybe, maybe not.&nbsp; Who knows?

      Don't get me wrong, I love my life and I know it's nowhere near as difficult as most people...It just feels like my life is falling apart at the seams and crashing down into a pile of rubble.&nbsp; My best friend and I got into a huge fight the other day and now we're not speaking.&nbsp; The person I love the most is clueless to how I feel.&nbsp; I would tell him, but every time I open up to a guy and tell him how I feel, he runs off in a blind panic due to fear of myself.&nbsp; I've been told that holding one's love inside can make you physically sick...I'm starting to agree.&nbsp; One of my awesome buds is moving fourteen hours away.&nbsp; His father is suffering from terminal cancer...it's a lot better than where it started off at, but he's not "out of the woods" just yet.&nbsp; Lastly, my "sister" had open heart surgery at the age of fourteen.&nbsp; I'm so scared that something will go wrong and that I will lose her...I don't know what I would do without her.&nbsp; There's so many other little things that are happening, but those are the main things.&nbsp; I wish that just one of these things would go away.&nbsp; I wish that my best friend and I would resolve our issues, that I would muster up the courage to tell that special someone how I really feel, that my bud's father's cancer would go away, and that my "sister" gets out of the hospital so&nbsp;I can quit losing sleep over her condition.&nbsp; Frankly, at this point I wish that I lived in the middle of nowhere with as little human contact as possible.&nbsp; Life would be so much easier that way.
