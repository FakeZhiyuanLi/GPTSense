       **Life isn't about the breaths we take...its about the moments that take your breath away.    **Care more about your character than your reputation because your reputation is just what people think of you, but your character is  who you are .    **I dropped a tear in the ocean - When i find it is the day I stop loving him     **You can only go as far as you push.     **Everything’s o.k. in the end, if it’s not o.k. it’s not the end.     **The soul would have no rainbows had the eyes no tears.     **Everyone sees you as you appear to be; few realize what you really are.     **What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.     **Sometimes I wonder if life is really worth it, then I look at your smile and I know it is     **Love is when you take away the feeling, the passion, the romance and you find out you still care for that person     ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*So Much Babbling...For No Reason At All*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

       Forever is a long time.   But I get those feelings...those days when...forever is exactly how long I want it to last. With my luck though....the things I really want....the people I really want....won't be around me forever.    They'll leave...disappear.   Thats what always happens.  Thats what scares me.  I finally get to the point where I'm caring about things...about people again...and theres such a huge chance of it all disappearing.  Then I'll be left...hurt again...alone.   I want forever.  Forever is what I need. But forever won't work out for me.   This makes no sense in words...only in my mind I guess...

       Just sitting here.   Thats what I've been doing for so long. I haven't had such an urge to write for a few days. The only problem is I can't seperate my thoughts. I can't put them into the right words...but  I need to get it out.   He told me about what happened at grad last night. And truthfully, I'm upset about it. Not towards him...never. Towards..just everything.  I can't believe she did that. I don't care if she was drunk, I'm still pissed off!!! She had her hands down my boyfriends fucking pants!!! It should be understandable if I'm pissed off.  I might be so pissed off because, shes his ex girlfriend...plus, I just don't like her.  I don't want him to think I don't trust him. I do...I trust him so much. I trust him more than I've trusted someone in A  LONG  time.  *UGH*  I knew something was going to happen last night. He says I shouldn't expect things to happen...but I just had a bad feeling.   I just don't trust other people. Its so  STUPID  I know..and its just hard to explain. Its like...I'm not there, so I don't know whats happening...and I don't know alot of the girls he hangs with...so I don't know how they feel about him. Like his exgirlfriend...look what happened there. Plus...everyone was drinking.   Its like..what if he gets really drunk..and some really drunk girl...I don't know. Its stupid. He was drinking last night, was he not? Was he still sober when she did that...is that why he had...good judgement? Or was he drunk...but still...made a good choice and pushed her away? I just wonder if...he'll have control over what happens even when hes drunk...will he still remember me? God...now I sound like I don't trust him... I REALLY DO TRUST YOU!   I hate to say that I expected something like that to happen. It not like I expected  HIM  to do anything. Never. I trust him. I know he cares about me.  I think my jealously also comes into play when I get upset over these stupid things...and my low self esteem. As I see it, theres so many better girls out there. I'm scared he still has feelings for an old girlfriend. Yes,  I know he loves me ...I know I'm important to him. But theres always old feelings...I don't know whats going on in his mind...if old feelings came up...I don't think he'd tell me I just worry about losing him. What if when she did that last night..and started saying those things to him last night...what if old feelings for her came up? I know, you say it won't happen....but I can still worry...its just me.  Its the way I am.  He said that I should have told him I had a bad feeling about him going to grad. He says he wouldn't have gone if I told him I wasn't comfortable. I don't want to be like that though. I don't want him to cancel plans, because I don't feel right about it. He went out with his friends...I'm not going to stop him. Its his life, and I don't want people to think I'm trying to control him. I mean, I already don't know what his friends think of me...I don't need them seeing me like that.  I feel kind of bad for saying all of this. It seems like I'm questioning him. Its stupid, because I'm not.   With everything that happened, I dont' see him differently!!!  Never.   I just hope that after he reads this, he won't feel different about me...or see me different or anything. Its just me venting...getting some of this stupid, confusing shit out.  I don't want him to feel bad about what happened...or feel bad about anything I write.    ^-^-^ Sorry you have to read about my thoughts on all this...but at least you know how I feel, right???...^-^-^    Write more later...when I figure out exactly what I feel...

      First...I read the comment he left. Thank you. I needed to know that, really. And eventually...I will be able to talk to you...tell you these things, off of this blog. But for now...I can just write it. I hope you can accept that.  I love him. And he bought me a rose for the 2 month thing.....its beautiful..and I love it. Thank you hun!    On a different, totally...unhappy? topic....   I can't believe he doesn't trust me!!!!! He thought I was gone, making out with Ryan! But  GOD ...thats not what happens. Ryan has been one of my best friends  ALL MY LIFE ...  AND I'M not like that....... I DONT CHEAT.   And then he told my friend , that its easier to expect the worse.   I'M GLAD I MAKE YOU EXPECT THE WORSE :(   I don't know how to take this. He made a comment about me cheating...maybe he was just kidding...but I think, a part of him expects me to cheat. This is just....so shitty. When my friend told me he said that, it just made me feel  SO GOOD ...not. He tells me he trusts me--> well if you trust me, why even CONSIDER that? Whatever.  He needs to realize that just because I hang out with alot of guys, doesn't mean I cheat. If he gets mad because I go off with just Ryan, how is he going to take it when I go out one night with a group of my guy friends? How is he going to take it when my guy friends from that little hick town come here and want me to go out with them? Yeah...there's going to be times when I'm the only girl there...but thats how its been with me for a long time.  I mean, I grew up...around only guys. Up until like...grade 3?...there was about 3/4 of my friends...my best friends....were guys.  Maybe I'm over reactting...but still...I need to get this out.  I love him so much ...and it just kills me to think that, he won't trust me.  And whats going to make this even worse, if he doesn't trust me...three of my guy friends asked me to go out for coffee or something for awhile tomorrow because they will be in town. And I mean, hes going to be at work..and by the time he gets off work, I won't be able to do anything...so I told my friends I'd see if I could go out.  Is that horrible? I mean, I haven't seen them for awhile..and hes going to still be working by the time they get in...so is it so horrible if I go out for coffee, or just go driving with them for an hour or so?   Fuck ...if its going to make things even worse....screw it. I can't do it, even if they're just my friends. I don't want him to take it the wrong way...that I'm making plans with them, even when I told him I probably couldn't do anything once he got off work.  He doesn't like that fact that I talk to some of these guys. It makes him uncomfortable..and yea,one of them is my ex boyfriend. But before that guy was ever my boyfriend, he was one of my best friend...and that part of our relationship is still there...we're still  FRIENDS .   Nothing more.   Whatever...I know he's going to feel uncomfortable..so maybe I won't go.  I just need him to decide right now, does he trust me or not, even if I'm with a bunch of guys, when hes not around...  I can't change it if he doesn't trust me. And I'm not going to stop going off places, going out with those guy friends...because I'm not doing anything wrong...and I won't be doing anything wrong.  I don't cheat...and I never will.  So much going on in my mind right now...but this is all I can write for now...thats all I can put into words right now...   *^*^*^* Gettin NO Sleep Tonight... *^*^*^*

       Today started out to be such a bad day.  He came over, then had to go home...it sucked! GOD....those ppl just need to lighten up....I'm not their little girl anymore...but w/e.  Then I got in one of those moods again. I talked to him on the phone. He sounded concerned...and kept asking what was wrong. I said nothing, but he didn't believe me. I think he thinks that I don't want to tell him things..or talk to him.   Thats not it.  How can I explain it to him more than he already knows?   " Oh , by the way hunnay...when I get like that...don't worry...its just me getting depressed for no god damn reason..it happens. Ya know, just random times when I feel like shit...feel like dying. No Biggie though. I always get over it really fast."    Yea...like that would ever work. Pfft....I guess the secrets out now. But its not something I talk about...to anyone.  I'm sorry.   I don't want him to worry about me. I already know he cares about me.  JUST PLEASE DONT WORRY .....I still have bad days...I'm sorry...I can't get over it just like that...but I'm getting better. But the last thing I need it you worrying none stop.  Sometimes I feel bad. He tries so hard to get me to see myself better. I want to, I really do. Its hard. But I'm trying...for you, I'm really trying. It takes time... so   please be patient with me  ...  But I did end up seeing him tonight. It was sooo good. I love him so much!!! I love the fact that when I'm with him...I can...just be with him. And truthfully...when I'm with him...I feel like...I'm safe...like I don't have to worry about anything anymore...and thats such a  GREAT  feeling.  I'm sick of worrying about everything..about myself.. its too draining...and I'm just...tired...    :) 2 whole months today :)    I'm sooo happy. I hope we last...like...long term. Hes everything I care about right now. He's helped me care about things....I'd given up on. He's just so important to me...I hope he knows that   (I know he'll read this...and I'm sorry you have to read these things on here...instead of hearing them from my mouth...but its hard for me still...I'm not good with emotions, or expressing how I feel...give it time..eventually I'll be able to say these things to your face. I do want you to know these things...thats why I type them on here...I know, you'll eventually check it again...and read what I have to say..I wanna tell you these things in person...but not yet...even though I trust you with...everything...with my life basically...I can't talk face to face about this...I can't make that move..)   How long we last is all up to him...I hope he doesn't just...change his mind one day. He says he won't do that...and I believe him...but  its just like me to worry about everything ...

      Is it bad that everytime I'm not allowed to do something with him, I feel so...upset?  I mean, I wanted to so something with him today...but plans didn't work out. Before I knew that I wouldn't be able to do something with him today...I was in a good mood.  But then...I had to tell him I couldn't do anything...and I felt so bad...so upset. Kind of depressed I guess. No, not the type of depressed where...I do old habits.   Just depressed.  And to make it even worse, I can tell when hes upset. Even if he says "its alright" I know he's kind of mad at me and that makes me feel even worse.  I keep letting him down. I know he's going to get sick of the fact that I can never do anything.  And he asks why he can never come over..or why I can never do anything. And I can't give him a reason. I don't know how to explain it to him....and I know he probably thinks I'm making excuses or something...But   thats NOT IT!    Its stupid...I know I'm going to screw it up by never being able to do stuff with him. He says he'll wait, and hes happy with w/e time he gets to spend with me...but he won't wait around forever...he's going to get tired of..me letting him down.. I dunno...so much babble...hard to make sense of it all.  Today just sucks.  I hate that I feel like this. I mean, I saw him just last night..and it was great. I love being with him.  I love him.  But if I see him tonight, which I really hope I can...but kinda doubt I will...I just don't want to bring him down with my bad day. Thats what I'll do.  *ugh* this sucks...I need to go sleep....  sometimes thats the only way to be kind of relaxed for a little while...escape my stress...if thats even possible.

      Thats all I seem to hear today. People keep talking.. try to communicate with me...but all I hear is blah blah blah....maybe I just don't want to hear what they have to say....I just don't care anymore.   "You're capable of better"......."you're not trying"........"you're attitude sucks"   I DONT WANNA HEAR THAT SHIT ANYMORE   You don't know me...you have no clue whats going on with me...if you did, maybe I wouldn't feel so lost all the time. Maybe I'd have better self esteem. Maybe I wouldn't break down because I'm keeping so much inside.  If you stopped making assumptions for  ONE MINUTE   and asked...show you actually care about my opinion, you'd have a better idea of who I am.  I'm not that little girl you want me to be. Only if you knew how much I've changed...but no, you don't know. Because, you don't want to. You don't wanna come to terms with the fact that yes, I have problems with myself. Yes, I feel confused. And yes, there are times where I feel so frustrated with life, with you...so frustrated with myself and everything I do, that I want to die...just go to sleep and never wake up.  I know you'd be scared of me if you knew that. And if you knew me or what i've done you'd freak out, send me away. You wouldn't try to talk about it to me..you'd just yell and tell me what to do.  Thats why I don't approach you. I don't tell you what I feel. I don't break down in front of you, even when I feel like I can't keep it in anymore. No, I keep that smile on..and I keep my mouth shut.  This is just a bunch of babbling that doesn't make any sense...its pointless...

      I was reading through forwardgarden...and I came across this poem in the suicide section (I was upset...and feeling kind of depressed...I guess i wanted to read about other peoples problems for some strange reason.) I came across this poem...and I guess I was thinking "worst case scenerio" (sorry bout the spelling) and if I got really depressed..and had no other choice (but I know it won't ever be like that...but when I get sad or depressed...I play with thoughts in my head..yea, I know...I'm screwed in the head..oh well..don't worry bout it..)  I read this poem...and the bold parts...are parts I could relate to people in my life....at certain times. (can you tell I'm bored)  I'm sorry for what you'll have to see                         When I take this knife                                          I'm sorry for what you had to know                               Before I take my life                           I'm sorry for when my blood starts to drip Onto the white tiled floor                     I'm sorry for this feeling I have                                   Craving the pain more                                               I'm sorry for being so screwed up                                     Wanting only to die                                                   I'm sorry for existing in this world                                 And if I start to cry                                                 I'm sorry for being a bitch to you                                 I deserve whats coming to me                                       I'm sorry for being locked away                                     Unable to be free                                                     I'm sorry for never being there                                       When you needed me                                                   I'm sorry for shutting everyone out                                 This is not who I wanted to be                                       I'm sorry for these scars on my wrist                               These wounds that will not heal                                       I'm sorry for my f*cked up ways                                       Yet this is how I deal                                               I'm sorry for bringing you into my life                             So you could watch me die                                           I'm sorry that I have to do this                                   And leave you wondering why                                           I'm sorry for my life on earth                                       And what I put you through                                           I'm sorry for not telling you sooner                                 On what I'm going to do   don't think about it too much....just a thought that goes in my mind...when I get down....when I was upset before.   ^*^*^ the picnic table kind of put me in a better mood:) lol ^*^*^

         I CAN NOT BELIEVE HIM    Whatever..its my fault,  just like always , right? I'm asking for it,  just like always , right?  Do I really deserve him calling me down?  People wonder why I still have low self esteem...well  his comments don't make it any easier.   I can't stand it when people swear...or yell at me. Especially him...especially when he has that look on his face.  I'm a disappointment... I GET IT ALREADY . I don't need him telling me all the time.  I don't think he realizes how he makes me feel. He wonders why I hate him so much.  I never said I hate him. Sometimes, yes... I really do .   Just when he treats me like that .  I'm glad I went to her work, and told her what he said to me. She's going to have alot to say to him now.   He either stops treating me like this...or we leave like before.   Now its up to him I guess...he can keep the anger and the yelling, and swearing at me everytime something goes wrong...   or he can lose me...more than he already has...for good.      ~*~*~* I'm not going to keep taking it *~*~*~

       My sister  (not by birth..but my sister) called me tonight. I was so glad to hear from her. Shes home now...sounding happy. I really need to talk to her every so often.  I miss her , and yea...at times I get so mad because she tries to get involved with my life...but she means well...and  I love her  for it.  Well...we were talking about the past. Reading over poetry together. Talking about when we lived together. Good things to talk about.  Good and Bad memories .  Things I don't want to forget .  She asked me if I remembered this poem she wrote..then she read it to me. At first I knew the poem was familiar..but I didn't remember why or when she wrote it. Then she told me. It was about me. When I was unhappy. Then as soon as she told me about which night she wrote it...and automatically... I remembered why she wrote it .  Those weren't good times. That night...when she wrote the poem...it was so horrible. As soon as she reminded me about it...I couldn't stop reliving that night in my head.  Its crazy, I know.  That was a hard night...not something I like to remember. But maybe...remembering that night is good for me...a reminder for why I shouldn't become like that again.    He's a really good reason not to get like that again ...my main reason right now...but if I  ever  slip into it again...that memory  might  help.    ~*~* Right now I just want to forget all that shit for once..since I'm the only one who cares to talk about those times. Since I'm the only one who cares...I want that memory to disappear for now...until maybe, one day...someone will need to actually hear those things...know they're not alone...know that I've survived shit like that...just maybe...who knows...and who really cares...??? *~*~     (sorry....making no sense...just babbling.)

      Who knew one word.....four letters.....could be soo scary and meaningful?  The phrase "I love you" isn't something to be taken lightly...and just shouldn't be said unless its true.  I hope he really means it.....I have such a good feeling about us. I hope me and him last...I'm sure we'll last for a good amount of time...hopefully a long time...but I guess its up to him.     "I Love You"    wow...scary...but when I hear those words together...from him.... its the best feeling in the world...

       the funeral was today. He died on Friday... the 11th... The funeral was hard...of course. But I wrote a poem about it and I finally decided to post it on here:    *Grandpa*    You fought your last battle- lasted as long as you could. Now you've gone so peacefully up to heaven, like you should. I know I never showed it well but you should know I really love you. Don't worry about Grandma- we'll find something for her to do. Mom is gonna be okay- Its alright to be upset. She really loves you- I know shes glad you and grandma met. Everything's okay down here- its time for you to rest now. It'll be weird without you here, but we'll adjust somehow. And now that you're up in heaven I hope you can hear- I'm gonna really miss you and I love you Grandpa dear.  Yep...its not that good...but oh well.

       I can't stand it. Seeing her cry. And the fact that it was my own family...my great auntie and unlce who brought the tears...just makes me want to scream. They're sooo lucky I wasn't around when they were getting up in her face. I would have reemed them out soooo bad.            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!STUPID ALCOHOLICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Why the hell do people DRINK :'( Especially when it tears families apart like that...I wish they would just change already...I can't take it anymore...seeing my mom get upset over something stupid like drinking.  He came to the funeral with me...I needed that. He gave me strength...kept me from breaking down...even though I know he wouldn't have minded if i cried...but I didn't want to. Then I got mad @ him today. He made a comment that was involving my appearance...and he was just joking around...but when he said it...I slapped him across the face...got off the couch and sat on the ground..away from him. I feel soo bad for slapping him. He didn't deserve it, even though he says he does. He tells me he feels so bad...and I believe him.  I shouldn't be so touchy about my appearance...but I can't help it. I want to change it...I do. I mean...the fact that I was touchy enough about it to slap him today..is crazy.  I feel so bad.  I love him to death...I just can't believe I did that. Fuck..the best thing to ever happen to me..and I'm pulling stupid shit like that. Good Job. If I'm not careful, I'm gonna end up losing him because of something stupid like that... then my world would fall apart again.  I just hope he knows I really love him..so much. I know he'll read this eventually...

        I find it funny, how most of my friends have been through the same things as me. You know...the hard, sad things. I mean...When you get depressed...isn't it the last thing you need...you're friends being able to agree with you...doesn't that just bring you down even more? yea, I know...its nice to have people you can relate with...people who understand you... I don't know how to say what I mean in words...   It seems like most of the friends I've kept....get like I do. And it scares me. Tonight... I talked to my ex...and he was freaking out. Just broke up with his gf. I know him so well...before we went out, we were best friends...and at times, we can still be really close. I didn't trust him...I was scared that he'd try something stupid again...like he's done so many times before. So I told him to call me. We talked for what....half an hour? I worry for him. I'm not depressed right now..sure I get sad sometimes...but not depressed like before. And when I hear those type of things come out of his mouth...the things I used to say...I think..."why the hell would anyone ever consider that?" But the thing that made me happy was, he opened up to me again...just like before we ever went out...he trusted me...I know that for a fact...he even told me. And yea, I miss that. He was always a good friend to me.  People expect that just because i talk to my ex again...that I still have feelings for him.....  GOD >>>>> THATS NOT IT  ........yes, I care about him...but not like that. Not anymore. Now, I have someone I'm crazy about...someone I love to death...and nothings gonna change that...especially old feelings. I'm just scared hes gonna .... not trust me.... if I talk to my ex.... I know hes scared about the whole cheating thing. He says he trusts me..and I believe him, but I know theres a part of him thats always gonna feel unsure. He says hes just like that...and I understand why. I get that way too.  I hope he becomes okay with me talkin to my ex. I have a feeling me and him will be talkin alot more now. I just wanna be a good friend... I want our friendship to be like it was this summer. But if me and my ex becoming good friends again jepordizes me and him in anyway...I won't do it.. I can't lose him..I love my bf to death...and I just...don't wanna screw it up.  I know he'll read this...say that I won't screw things up. W/e...I want him to know this stuff...even if it is just me venting...  He's been nothing but good to me. Like right now...talking to him, hearing how I've...changed him...is good for me. The whole reason our conversation started was him telling me how I don't give myself enough credit. I know my low self esteem bothers him..hes told me that before...but I can't change that. If I could, I would have over a year ago...when I started getting depressed. I mean...when I first started to get depressed..it wasn't so bad. Yea, I had low self esteem...but it could have gotten better. But then...the physical...stupid stupid physical things started happening. That brought me down even more...and soon...it was uncontrollable. But did I tell anyone...or try to get the help that I need...the help that would have gotten be back exactly how I was before...that same happy girl? No...I didn't.  Stupid move...I know... I mean...look what that left me with...

      After posting that little poem thing...I started reading one of my books I wrote in...and I feel like posting some of my poems on here...just a couple though...they're kinda of self explainitory...sorry my spelling's shit.   *My Letter*  I'm writing you this letter trying my hardest to explain I want you to understand why I feel this pain. Never being accepted for who I want to be So I put a disguise on I act like I'm worry free. I've never thought of suicide well actually-thats a lie Theres been so many times I've prayed to God I'd die. Theres been so many times I've been tempted by that knife So many times I've picked it up deciding if I should end my life. So far I've never really gone through with my ideas of how to die Instead, I sit here writing- trying my hardest not to cry. I hope you'll accept me maybe you can understand somehow Even though I'm full of hidden hate I'll stay alive for now.   *filled with secrets*  Filled with secrets I can not share. I have to be strong besides-no one will care. Filled with secrets making life hell. I'm trying to be happy but I'm wanting to yell. Filled with secrets the reasons I always cry. I'm told to smile but i want to die. Filled with secrets I'm gonna keep inside. This is me pretending- I hope you're satisfied.   *Me*  I'm all alone. Yet theres people all around.  I am cut. Yet I do not bleed.  I am dead. Yet I am still breathing.  I do not love. Yet my heart is breaking.  I feel no pain. Yet my body's aching.  I am unbeatable. Yet I am hurt.  I am troubled. And Yet I smile.  I am me.   *She*  She locks herself in her room, Tears streaming down her face. She sits quietly in the darkness, hoping to escape this place. Nothing she does is ever right, no matter how hard she tries. She's forced to act happy, but her feelings shown are lies. She sits with them in a room, silence fills the air. She tries to hide her true emotions as he gives her that angry stare. He's always yelling Hes what makes her cry. He just doesn't understand her, he makes her wanna die. She can never talk to him, shes filled with too much hate you see. This girl whos hurting from this life, well she is really me.

      No caring looks. No kisses goodbye. No hugs hello. No tears to cry. No late night calls- just all alone. No shared secrets. I remain unknown.   I was looking through my poetry....thats one I came across. I don't know what was wrong when I wrote it...but I remember what I felt. Reading it again...kinda made me shiver. Those weren't good days. When I used to write. I wrote about unhappy things. Death. Eating Disorders. Suicide. Cutting. Depression. Loneliness. Things most people won't go near. No one likes to talk about those type of things...but me...I don't mind it. Alot of people are scared to bring those things up around me.  why?  If people bothered to talk to me about those things...they would learn alot about me. Sometimes I wish people would just talk about it to me if thats whats on their minds..instead of waiting till I'm gone to ask my friends questions about me... "did she really do that?" ... "is she depressed?" ... "whats wrong with her?" Its scary I know..the fact that people have to talk to me about such serious things...just to learn a little bit about my life. But its the truth. Did that even make sense? I'll stop babbling now... I can't put my thoughts into the right words...

       I've been awake for so long already. I'm tired and yet I can't go back to sleep.  I look out the window, and I can already tell that today is goin to be a bad day. Right now, its raining out...the sky's dark...a depressing day on the way. A part of me doesn't want to go to school at all today. All I'll hear is fake sympathy...I hate that. When people say "OMG, I'm sorry for your loss" or stupid shit like that...it makes me want to punch them...because I know they really don't care. Oh well...seein my true friends, and him...that'll make today a little better. I wasn't planning on going to any classes today...sleep all morning...skip all afternoon...maybe with him....maybe alone, who knows.  We talked about it last night...and he's decided to come to the funeral on Thursday with me. When he said that, I was kind of relieved...I really want him there with me. Its gonna be hard...but now, I'll at least have him there if I need to talk or anything. I just hope he realizes theres gonna be a lot of emotions going around...and then, crazy relatives who love sticking their noses in other peoples business. Oh well...we can always go walking around that small ass town if things get boring or annoying. Maybe we'll just try and stay around Mike and Christine. Those are the youngest people that I know are going....kind of scary. Oh well...hopefully everything will go smoothly.  The actual funeral part is going to kill me. I know my mom and grandma will be crying a lot. I hate when other people cry. I know I won't let myself cry during the funeral...maybe later on, if I can't keep my emotions in anymore. I think I've been doing a good job at it so far. He tells me I shouldn't hold them in...that I don't have to be strong...but I still feel like I have to be strong for everyone...my mom especially. It kills her when I cry....and I don't know why, but crying around her just isn't something I want to do. I've been doing such a good job at not telling my mom things to do with my personal life...or anything I'm feeling. The most I've let her get involved with my life is when I let her meet him...and know about us, what was going on.  It's sad really.....I've managed to push my mom out of my life now......she used to be my best friend....

       I went to my grandmas house today. Today I realized how much I hate seeing other people cry. We listened to old tapes from when I was about 5 years old...when I used to be close to my grandpa. I was talking to him...telling him I loved him. The fact that hes actually gone now is was made it sad I think.  Oh...My dad said he could come to the funeral if I wanted him to. The fact that my dad suggested I ask my boyfriend to come to a family thing, is a step forward, is it not? Maybe my parents just realize how important he is to me now. i kind of hope he comes...I could really use him there...kinda keep me sane...with all the sadness thats going to be around me. He kind of gives me strength? Is that weird to say...I dunno.  Seeing all of the family this week is gonna kind of be stressful. So many people I haven't seen for years...some that I haven't even met. I'll need that smile...my best disguise. I don't cry around my closest friends...well, I do...I just don't like it. I can't show my true emotion around people who are practicaly strangers to me. I couldn't let myself.  Today is full of so much pointless babble.... I think I'll stop typing now. This is boring enough already..

       Another entry today....probably not the last today either. Theres alot of thoughts going on in my head right now....just about everything.  Mirrors shouldn't exist. Anyone who has ever had low self esteem would know what I mean. When I get depressed...or just sad...a mirror is the last thing I need around me. At times like that..its like, when I look into the mirror... I can't see clearly. Theres just this...blurry...umfamiliar image looking back at me. Then even more sadness runs through me. I see a lost girl...a sad, lonely girl...who just wants to be accepted. It feels at times that people are always just judging me. I hate it. Who knows, that might not even be the case. I just wish that when I look in the mirror next time...there will be a girl, who doesn't have to fake a smile.  Its stupid I know. And I know that if certain people ever read this...friends or w/e....they'll see me different...or not agree. Not understand what I mean. Oh well...I'm used to it by now I guess...them just not understanding my thoughts.  On a kinda different topic, I'm scared he'll read this one day...and I dunno...get mad I guess? He hates when I call myself down. He tells me I have so much going for me. I say hes the best thing thats happened to me in a long time...he disagrees. Its things like that...that makes me think he doesn't realize how important he is to me. And I know I won't tell him that...no more than showing him my blog thingy. Other than that...I can't express it to him. I don't know why. He's amazing to me...thats why I love him to death.  More thoughts later...

      I hate death. I hate losing someone I love. I hate feeling so helpless. I hate having to lie. I hate being the strong one. I hate that I can't cry.  So much hate in me right now. Truthfully, I feel like a horrible person... he died... and I was a jerk to him for the last 2 years. Okay, so maybe I wasn't a JERK...but I sure kept myself distant from him. Hes had ALS (thats what its called I think) for the last 12 years...most of my life.  I forget what it was like for him to walk. I forget what it was like to actually talk to him. I forget what it was like to be able to understand the words he said. I forget the last time he could ever do something for himself. I forget the last time my grandma didn't have to wake up 10 times a night just to make sure he was okay.  Why is it that the things I forget now are the things I want to remember...but the things I want to forget, are still with me?  I wanna forget the times I had to leave the dining room because he was coughing, choking..because he was barely able to swallow food anymore. I wanna forget the times I had to go to the hospital just to see him laying in the hospital bed...so helpless. I wanna forget the many times I saw my mom cry because of what was happening to him. I wanna forget the times my mom talked about losing him..like it was expected to happen the next day. I wanna forget the times I visited them...and had to watch him slowly get worse and worse.  I hate death.

        My first entry on this site...kinda cool. Right now, theres so much I wanna say. So much I need to get out I guess. I just hate when I need to say something...but no words come. Lately, I've been upset really easily. I mean...its been so long since I was this emotional. And yea I know, being emotional isn't a bad thing all the time. But sometimes I feel like theres all this weight on me...pushing me down. And sometimes, I can't get back up. Thats when I'm the most scared. I hate being depressed...yet I can't control it. When I get depressed, I lose all strength.  My friends are my strength...and all I do these days is push people away. Its a bad habit, I know. The one day that I actually need my friends...they won't be here. They would have listened to me...and left when I told them to.  Hes so much of my strength these days. He means so much to me. If I lost him, I don't know what I would do. And I'm scared he doesn't know how I feel. I'm horrible with sharing things like that. I'm scared. All the time. And its horrible..I don't wanna be scared...but I guess I'm so scared because I know what'll happen to me if I lose him....  I don't want that to happen...I don't wanna get like that...its so scary...but I'll jsut have to learn to deal with it

      Ok.  Letting it all out sometimes sucks.  Its hard.  I know that.  I hate expressing my feelings.  It leaves you....vunerable in a way.  Its like you're setting yourself up for critizism.  I hate that.  I hate when people judge.  Its not like it helps....it just makes matters worse.   Not crying in 2 months.....is that really good?  Is it because you hold it in....  or because you can't bring yourself to show your emotions? Why don't you let people know how you feel because holding it all in can't be good. It isn't. I know. If you just say what you feel...it could help. Don't be so distant from everyone. Its not going to help if you push everyone away. Pushing people away just leaves you...  alone.  Then, when you actually need someone, no ones going to be there...because they all gave up. I know. It kind of happened to me at one time. But you know, I'm not going to leave. I know what that feels like to be left alone when you thought that was what you wanted. Then you just realize once everyones gone that what you really wanted was for  everyone to try a little harder. I don't know what I'm trying to get at. Maybe I'm just babblin for no reason. Cry. Try it. It helps...trust me. Whatever you're feeling...crying helps. It helps me. Even if things seem to be good...I cry regularly. (ok, so maybe I sound like a big wimp..but its true) Cry...write...draw...or talk about it to someone. Just don't cut. Please. I've learned that it doesn't help anything. It just leaves reminders. And whether or not you want me to, I'm going to worry about you. Its what I do. I worry about the people I love. Because I know how it feels to  just feel some of the things you feel. Maybe not exactly...but similar. Talk to me whenever you need. I'm here for you whether you want me to be or not. Thats one thing you can't change.

      &nbsp;  Don't do this.   Please. I'm begging you. Don't do this to yourself.   I'm scared for you.   How long has it been since you last hurt yourself?   I'm a Hypocrite. Maybe.   But please. Stop.   I don't know exactly whats going on with you.   But its not worth doing this again.   I know.   I was there.   Same as you.   Well, maybe not the&nbsp;same...but close to it.   You know I worry.   I know they worry.   Anyone who knows,   anyone whos seen the marks.   I remember how comforting it was....but its just  NOT THE ANSWER.    Do you really want to be left with those marks to remind you   of all the pain or confusion you felt?   Is it still going to seem like it was worth it when you're older   and have children...then when you have to explain   why  "mommy"  has so many scars?   No.   I know thats what you're thinking.   Talk to me.   Please.   Just don't do it again.   The more you do it, the harder its going to be to stop.   I know this for a fact.   Everything will get better.   I know it doesn't seem like it..I never thought that was true   but I now I realize...it always does get better.   We've been through  SO MUCH  together.   You've always been there for me.   Whenever I really needed a friend...someone who wouldn't judge me.   You were there.   Let me be there for you.   I won't judge.   You know that.   Next time you feel tempted... FIND ME .   If I'm not home...ask where I am...get the phone # there...   and  CALL ME.    Please.   I don't want you to hurt yourself.   I don't know how bad things are.   I haven't seen you for so long.   I just don't want you to have a  REALLY  bad day or moment..   then go deeper than you expected.   I've been there.   I know its possible.   Just please.   Open up to me.   You can trust me.   I know it might seem like you can't put anything into words   or you can't talk to anyone...because no one would understand.    TRY ME.    Even if I don't understand exactly...   I'm hear to listen.   I care.   You know that.   Even if the words you say make no sense....Let them out.   Just please,    TALK TO ME    instead of hurting yourself.   I'll try to help you in any way possible.   I just don't want to go on&nbsp;knowing you're hurting yourself   and I didn't  TRY  to help in any way I could.   I'm here for you.    I LOVE YOU.    Don't forget that.   You've always been there to listen when I needed.   It helps to let it all out...even if it doesn't make sense..or fit together...   getting it all out...helps a little.   Whenever you need me......I'll be there.   Just please remember that...

      God.   Today is stupid. I hate today so much. It sucked....I wish it was over already. The highlight of today was when I was sleeping.     "sleep is a beautiful thing. Its the only way to escape my reality."     Okay, so maybe that saying doesn't totally work for me....my reality isn't bad. I've got him in my life. But other than him....its so stressful. Sometimes I just hate it. When I'm with him or in his arms, I wish I could just stay there and never leave. It just all feels so right with him. He makes everything perfect when I'm with him. I hope we stay together   FoReVeR  ....or a really long time at least.   Well...now I'm talking to him...I'm feeling alot better...not as...stressed or overwhelmed! He seems to do that for me.   Woah...that just freaked me out. I went to the door and it was the police! Its late at night...my parents are sleeping, so its only me awake. I'm sitting in the basement, in the dark...then I heard the doorbell ring. I went up the stairs and unlocked the door...then there was just...this man standing there...it was freaky. I haven't had the police at my house for awhile...since my brother lived here I guess.    Ahh..what a good role model.   Truthfully....I've been thinking lately. If I don't get things sorted out...my thoughts sorted out....I'm thinking of going to see someone. Like a therapist or something. Not with my parents knowing....it would be, kind of a secret thing. I would pay for it and everything. Its something I feel like I need to do. Something I need to do in a way.    .......FUCKING OLD HABITS.......

       Today I started cleaning up my room a bit....cleaning out drawers...going through old things.    &nbsp;  I came across a book that my mom bought me at the perfect time...last year, when I was really feeling depressed. I don't know why she chose to buy my this book...but I think a part of her...just knew. Its a book, like chicken soup for the soul...except its called "Nobody's Perfect"    &nbsp;  I started reading through it again...I've read that book so many times...there's poems and stories I could probably recite from memory. That book helped me alot at times...kind of comforting I guess.    &nbsp;  This one poem I love for some reason:  &nbsp;    E Unum Pluribus        &nbsp;   She's an artist of sorts,     With her brushes and paints.     But she doesn't use canvas,     It's opinions she taints.       &nbsp;   Around certain "friends"     She paints on a grin.     So she can be popular,     so she can fit in.       &nbsp;   With other friends,     She's loud and obscene.     It's the ain if the game,     To be rowdy and mean.       &nbsp;   Close to her family,     She's quiet and shy.     They hardly take notice     If she is nearby.       &nbsp;   When she's with the guys,     She's a tease and a flirt.     She gives and she gives,     Ignoring the hurt.       &nbsp;   The people nearby her,     They hope and they pray     That they can be popular,     Like her one day.       &nbsp;   But when she's alone,     She breaks down and cries.     For there is no answer,     When she asks, "who am I?"   &nbsp;  I think I like this poem so much...because in some ways, in most ways....that was me @ one point.    &nbsp;  Meh....I'll post more later...I'm gonna finishing cleaning...and reminicing.... (sorry if my spelling sucks)

        &nbsp;  Sitting here....just been home a little while.&nbsp;I was at his house tonight...watched a couple movies, talked. I love it! I've seen him everyday since Wed....which is weird compared to how often we saw each other before...when we first started going out....but its 3 months on Friday...yay.    &nbsp;  God...I'm listening to music and reading "nobody's perfect". Ever since I've found that book again, I've wanted to read certain stories or poems...or sayings, over again.  &nbsp;  *^* I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself, and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.    &nbsp; &nbsp;  I love this one:  &nbsp;  ^*^ A Native American elder once described his own inner struggles in this manner: "Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The other dog is good. The mean dog fightd the good dog all the time." When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied, "The one I feed the most."    &nbsp;  *^*Since every failure is a lesson, every challenge an opportunity, and every joy a triumph, it's hard to go wrong.  &nbsp;   ^*^And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.   &nbsp;  Another one I really love:  &nbsp;   *^* And so I sit and wait for the day, when I can be&nbsp; seen in my own special way. Just myself, how I should be; Not at all perfect---just perfectly me.   &nbsp;  ^*^All of us are lying in the gutter, but some of us are looking up at the stars.      &nbsp;   *^*A "no" uttered from the deepest conviction is better and greater than a "yes" merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble.       &nbsp;   ^*^If I had just one wish, I'd visit younger days. And tell the younger me, "It all works out okay."   &nbsp;   *^*Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.   &nbsp;   ^*^We human beings can survive the most difficult of circumstances if we are not forced to stand alone.   &nbsp; &nbsp;  See...I have nothing better to do than go through this book, and pick out the sayings that I like. haha...thats almost all of them too.    &nbsp;  Well, I'm gonna stop babbling, and go lay down....continue thinking of him...

       &nbsp; I just woke up, feeling tired as ever....even though I just got over 12 hours of sleep. Hm..weird.     &nbsp;  Been feeling like everythings going good...going right. I've been with him...almost everday in the last week. His family came here for supper..our rents talk...I'm guessing they like each other...unless his rents were throwing empty laughter around...I doubt it. lol    &nbsp;  He came fishing with me and my parents yesterday...it wasn't bad...he was really quiet. Then once we were done fishing we came back to my house and he watched a movie with me and my rents. Well, my dad fell asleep...and so did he. He fell asleep on the couch where he was laying with me...kind of usuing me as a pillow in a way. It was cute. My mom kept looking at me while i layed there with him. She could tell how I felt. Like everything with him or about him was perfect. Is that crazy? My mom says we're so cute together.    &nbsp;  His mom framed a picture of me and him together at the fair. I have a copy of it too now...I'm gonna frame it...if my mom doesn't steal it from me first.    &nbsp;  Things are starting to feel...like they're working out? I don't know. I mean, he comes over here more...my parents know we're together (obviously)...my dads actually acting like hes fine with it...I think he is (when I showed&nbsp;my dad&nbsp;the picture of me and him at the fair together...he actually was like "oh, thats a nice picture."..crazy)    &nbsp;  I just have this feeling....like its going to last. Not like I&nbsp;didn't feel that before, but I mean..it just feels right now...because my parents&nbsp;are actually getting to know&nbsp;him, they like him...they've met his rents, they like them...its just making it kind of easier to be together in a way I&nbsp;guess.    &nbsp;  Ignore me. I'm babbling about this...it sounds crazy....I just don't know how to say it I guess.    &nbsp;  Boss man&nbsp;just called....I&nbsp;get to work Saturday....yay. lol Oh well, I get to work with&nbsp;one of my best girls Kaitlyn&nbsp;too....once shes back from her damn vacation....which I think is today? I miss her....I want my&nbsp;girl back. Oh, and Holly's back from her trip on Saturday too....damn, I'll be at work...oh well...I'll see her Sunday. I miss her. haha....she'll actually get to see her boyfriend too, crazy!    &nbsp;  But I'm going to go....I need new coffee, this got cold while I typed. Maybe I'll sleep a little more too, before my mom gets home

            I was bored today   (once again)   so I decided to look up some sayings (  urlLink  www.forwardgarden.com   ) and I found a few sayings I really liked....some that reminded me of him...or something that happened in my life..or something&nbsp;that I just thought was true. Here's some of those sayings:     &nbsp;     ** Laying there with your arms around me I felt so comfortable and safe. My heart was beating a mile a minute having you so close to me. As you played with my hair and kissed me I couldn't help but smile straight from my heart. I could see how much you cared from the look you gave me.      &nbsp;    **I look at him, and he looks back at me with those amazing eyes, smiles, and it pathetically makes my day.    &nbsp;     ** People have been asking me left and right what's wrong with me lately. It's hard to explain when they don't understand what depression is like. They don't understand that "cute little me" could be suicidal. Someone like me doesn't take razor blades to their legs and wrists. Boy, were they wrong...     &nbsp;    **Me I'm scared of everything, I'm scared of who I am, What I saw, What I did, But most of all I'm scared of walking out of this room, and never feeling for the rest of my life the way I feel when I'm with you.    &nbsp;        **  &nbsp;There are 2 kinds of people in this world…those who tell jokes and sing in the shower and those who lie awake alone at night with tears in there eyes.          **I look again towards the sky as the raindrops mix with the tears I cry.       &nbsp;   **I dont want the whole world, just your part.     &nbsp;     **I want to be remembered as the girl who always smiled…the one who could brighten up your day, even if you couldn’t brighten her own.       &nbsp;      **Today I learned teddy bears don't solve problems and tears don't make them go away        &nbsp;    **I'm tired, I can't smile no more, I"m sure I'll just cave in, just like before...      &nbsp;     **If you think my eyes are beautiful its because they are looking at you         &nbsp;     **I love the way you laugh, I love the way you smile, I love the way you make my life seem worthwhile         &nbsp;    **It took me by surprise, I got lost in your eyes, you weren't at all what I was looking for, you were everything and so much more        &nbsp;    **One smile hides a thousand tears      &nbsp;     **I guess the most important things r tha hardest 2 say.       &nbsp;      **When I first saw you I was afraid to talk to you...When I first talked to you I was afraid to like you...When I first liked you I was afraid to love you...Now that I love you I'm afraid to lose you.        &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I dunno...sometimes I hate my thoughts.  *+*make them stop*+* &nbsp;After looking at love quotes...me and him had a serious talk...one that scared me in some ways...  god i'm so emotional.&nbsp;  &nbsp;I need to stop worrying so much. I wish people would stop worrying about me so much. I hate worry. It just...makes me...frustrated..and sad. Just down I guess. I know what its like to worry. I've done nothing but worry about myself and other people for the past 2 years...I don't need to go on knowing I'm putting someone through those feelings.     &nbsp;   Lots of babble...I need to go lay down soon&nbsp;I think...  I feel so drained  for some reason...

      Been sitting here doing nothing, but listening to music. I wonder what I'd do if I didn't have music...its such a big part of my life. I mean, I dance to it...I listen to it all the time, whenever I can...and I sometimes connect to it...understand the lyrics...I don't know, it's weird.  Haha...I remember the type of music I used to listen to so long ago. When I was younger: backstreet boys, n sync, spice girls brittney spears...all those people who were big at the time ( god, what a loser I was, hey? lol )  Then last year...rap and hip hop. Then Brittney spears and Christina Aguilera, stuff like that.   Now...look what I listen to: Slipknot, AFI, Linkin Park, Christina Aguilera, SOME avril lavinge(I like some of the lyrics), Mushroomhead, Blink 182, Evanesence...so many new / different artists.  These days, the lyrics are what catch my attention before the beat. If I read the lyrics before I ever heard the artist...and I liked them or felt like I could relate to them...I'd be hooked!  God...I really have nothing better to do tonight eh? I'm babbling about  SHIT ALL  ( like always ). I guess I just need something better to do than chat on MSN and listen to music...thats all I did today.      God my life can be boring sometimes.

      Happy.   Thats what I feel right now. Just happy. I got to see him tonight...and I really needed that. I missed him so much, even though it was only 4 days that we didn't see each other. Whats it going to be like when I go to the lake for a week or so?...crazy. God I love him. Just hugging him made everything better.  I can't believe he's going fishing with my parents on Friday. I think I should go to supervise. Make sure my dad doesn't throw him over the edge of the boat. And maybe to make sure he doesn't make any racist jokes towards my mom :)lol whatta guy.  I think I'm going to go lay down...listen to music...and just..  Be happy..      (I'mma nerd, I know lol)

      I said earlier that I just can't escape my thoughts...I can't escape myself. And I've been sitting here forever...doing nothing. So I decided that maybe writing on here will get some of the maddness out of me  (haha..if thats possible) And it most likely will make NO SENSE at all. Not like it ever does...but hey, they're just random thoughts, so it shouldn't matter.  (babbling once again)    Right now I feel so frustrated with life. Not necessarily my life. My friends life. Or life in general.   Like why do people resort to that type of shit for comfort? (I'm not being a hypocrite) I just hate the fact that it happens. I've been there. Pretty much all of my friends have been there.    ..just something about those beaded lines I guess..   Its scary. I was reading my best friend's blog. I hate the fact that shes back to old habits again. We were both there recently. I'm not now...I don't know whether or not she is right now either.  Old habits suck.  And I know they're hard to get away from... but so easy to turn to.  Its weird. Those memories...of those moments...are clearer now than when they actually happened.  Why is that?    Truthfully I wish I didn't have memories of those times at all. I wish I didn't know what it was like to do that. Because in my mind, I know how comforting it is to do that when you're overwhelmed or sad...or when  you can't feel at all .  Yea...well whoever actually reads my blog probably thinks I'm a major freak by now. Look what I write when I actually write on here...its fucked up.  Most of it doesn't even make sence...and I'm sure theres no one who could ever relate to what I babble about everyday.   Maybe I should just shut up for now...I won't make you read any more of this shit...lol...

      Instead of posting one of my thoughts...I decided to post some of my favorite lyrics that I have written in my book... AFI.    Wow, I wish I could write like this sometimes:     We held hands on the last night on earth. Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under the trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of town, but we knew everyone floated alone the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion you said  "Death is a midnight runner."    The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better past time. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two.  I rode alone.   You said "the cinders are falling like snow." There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elgies of savagery and eloquence. Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message.      Its so different, but the first time I heard it...I fell in love with it...I think I listened to it at least 10 times in a row that day....

       God.   I need to get out of here. Not out of my house, not out of this town. I just need to get away from myself. My thoughts..they won't stop. Why can't I just sit here without thinking anything like I do most of the time anyways? ( when I actually don't want to think, I do...but when I want to think...nothing comes to mind...god I'm fucked up .)  I think its just because I'm bored...maybe thats it.  I talked to him on the phone...first time in the last 3 days I think...what the hell! It seems like it was forever since I've heard his voice....I was happy it was him when I picked up the phone.  I don't even feel like typing on here right now...woah, weird...maybe I'll post something on here out of my book that I always write in....

       Wow.   Majorly bored. It sucks. Feels like I've been sitting here forever, doing nothing but thinking. And not even the type of thoughts that matter...just the really stupid ones.  [I wasn't lying when I said I was a freak!] lol     :: I can't even escape myself ::     Don't ask what that means, or where that came from...just a thought in my head.   Right now I feel so morbid..it's so fucked up. (I think morbid's the right word...well, I feel kind of different...scary..screwed up lol)  **Going to go back to my deadly thoughts of nothing... being freaky actually isn't that awful ...lol...too bad no one will actually know how my mind works when I get like this...**

      Been sitting here for over an hour...listening to music..making stories in my head...like a movie I guess.  **WOW...I must be really fucking bored**   Nothing better to do right now.    bad mood I guess. I can't believe him (not my bf). My ex boyfriend...one of my best friends. God, why does he do that to himself? He promised me he'd never go back to drugs...and he'd never attempt anything. Then look what he did...he's getting back into all that shit. I'm scared for him...I love him (as a friend of course). He was there for me...and I don't want to lose someone who's such a good friend. Kay, maybe I'm being a drama queen...but he's going to end up hurting himself again with that shit...what if he takes too much?! Maybe I should call him later...see how he is...we haven't talked for a couple days...I'm just hoping he isn't going out everynight and doing more shit.  Kay, I'm going to stop babbling on about this...it'll just make me worry.  One good thing...I'm going to the beach tomorrow...camping @ my friend's camp site..it'll be fun! :) Go swimming..it's shallow (lol) so its not like I have to worry about almost drowning again..*yuck*..not a good thought.   ---> what the hell type of mood am I in? Its so...   BLAH   ... a good mood, kind of tired/bored...lazy...totally out of it. Kay I'm going to stop babbling about nothing now

      I was talking about writing, reading and poetry with him earlier tonight..and I got in the mood to read what I've written...and I decided to post some! (they suck..and I wrote them basically all in grade 8 or last summer but w/e)     *whispers turn to screams*   She sits inside this room alone, knowing nothing is as it seems. she holds the blade to her skin- her whispers turn to screams. She knows no one will hear her, no one listens to what she says. Thats why she sits here crying, She knows she's not okay. She's tired of everyone saying they know exactly how she feels. she's tired of always lying- now she doesn't know how to deal. Everynight she crys alone, as nightmares replace her dreams. Thats why she's here with her blade as her whispers turn to screams.   (one of my more recent ones..written this year)    *The Voice*   Tears stream down my cheeks as I listen to the voice in my head. saying "you're so disgusting, you deserve to be dead." Everyday I'm haunted by the voice screaming at me. With every bite of food my mind begins to agree. Now I stand here on the bathroom scale. While the voice yells "you gained 3 pounds, I knew you would fail." Before when I looked at myself I liked everything I saw. But the voice has taught me different and has revealed my biggest flaw. I try to overcome the taunting voice inside my head. But my mind won't let me forget everything the voice has said. I try to leave my friend who comforted me when I was sad. But its still so hard to forget at one time food was all I had. So now I stand here  slowly wearing away. I'm left hungry and confused pretending I'm okay.    *Express*   Its been so long since I really cired. Is something wrong with me? I have emotions like everyone, I just express them differently. I don't express myself by crying, thats not the way I am. Instead, i hurt myself, but nobody gives a damn. When people find out my choice of expression all they do is judge. But I stand tall and take it in, their words won't make me budge. Its been so long since I really cried, so I think something's wrong with me. I have the same emotions, I've just learned to express them differently.   *Tempted*   She steps into the bathroom, tempted by her blade. Wanting to redo old marks, try to make her problems fade. Her hand quivers as she reaches for her old friend. Her heart races fast, maybe this'll be the end. Because everytime she sees her blade she plays with thoughts inside her head. The blade being the only solution, everytime she wished she were dead. Its been months since she  last cut to feel. Forgetting the beaded red lines, the only ways she could ever heal. But now she's tempted...    *A girl*   Each picture shows a darkened smile. A girl...feeling alone... still in denial... Each picture shows a saddened stare. A girl...full of stories... she's not ready to share... Each picture shows hidden regret. A girl...wanting to confess... yet wanting to forget... Each picture shows alot of things if you stop and really look hard. Each picture contains a girl... not ready to let down her guard... A girl...all alone... tired of lying. Sitting here...holding in tears... not showing that inside...she's dying...   (one day, my friends/family made a comment about how I never smile in pictures...how I always look so sad..and then I wrote this poem)     *Last Resort*   She slams the door and walks away. She wants to escape she can't handle another day. Keeping her anger in not saying whats on her mind. This is her last resort the only escape she can find. The pain is relaxing the marks are too real. Her worries drain out thought cuts that won't heal. She hides her arms hiding each scar. She keeps to herself happiness seems too far. She hates how she is now she hates what she's become. The fact that she does this seem so dumb. But that doesn't stop her as she grabs the blade. This is her last resort for her pain to slowly fade.   ( I wrote that last year...well, grade 8)     *He wasn't scared*   She sits there praying, trying hard not to cry. She asks god for help, he's still too young to die. She knew this happened all the time but never thought it'd happen to her. She was angry at god for doing this, giving him something which had no cure. He had always told her 'God has a plan for everyone. Live life to the fullest  before your time is done.' And before she started praying, he sat her on his knee. He told her he wasn't scared, he tried to make her see. He said no matter what happens, even if the doctors try. That he would always love her, and he wasn't scared to die.   (about someone who has cancer)     *I promised myself*  I promised myself no more lies. no more blaming myself no more late night cries. I promised myself I would be strong. I would try to be happy I would know right from wrong. I promised myself I'd try a new beginning. I'd try to be a new person I'd try to achieve something. I promised myself I couldn't be sad. I couldn't hurt myself I couldn't wreck everything I had. I promised myself, without realizing- promises can be broken....    *You think*   You think "shes so happy" But only if you knew... All the times I've cried alone, not sure of what else to do. You think "shes so carefree" But only if you could feel... The weight I carry on my shoulders, how many times I didn't know how to deal. You think "she never feels pain" But only if you could understand... everytime I've hurt myself just to feel, every idea carefully planned. You think 'shes so normal" but only if you could hear... every thought inside my head, ideas that only I don't fear. You think so many things about me, But only if you knew... I'm everything you wouldn't expect, your views of me are untrue. So I sit here thinking Only if you knew...    *Dark.Alone.Empty.*  dark.alone.empty. These are feelings  inside of me. dark.alone.empty. Wishing people could only see. dark.alone.empty. Trying hard not to cry. dark.alone.empty. Wondering why. dark.alone.empty. Trying not to  cut too deep. dark.alone.empty. Letting out the pains I keep. dark.alone.empty. dropping the blade on the floor. dark.alone.empty. Not wanting to do this anymore. dark.alone.empty. Tired of the pain I feel. dark.alone.empty. Wondering if these marks will heal. dark.alone.empty. Not wanting to be me. dark.alone.empty. Not liking the person I've grown to be. dark.alone.empty.   (gay, I know...wrote that one in like...grade 8 some time..not about me though...wrote it for my friend)     *Nameless*   He yells his angry words at her, shes not sure of what to do. Shes filled with hate deep inside, but that feelings nothing new. All these years he felt this way, even though he hid it well. But hes finally letting her know, hes letting the secret out of its shell. He hates the way she lives her life, he hates the path she decided to take. This love and exceptance that he showed was all an act, all fake. She wants to escape from this place which made her life a living hell. She can't handle all this hate, all the feelings she couldn't tell. But theres no way she can escape, theres no where she can run. She'd decided to give up in this war she never would have won. So from now on she'll hide, in her world full of hate. She can't fight his angry words, for that its much too late.   (old poem..written in grade 8...long story behind it..too much extra writing to explain)     *cutting*   Everynight when she lays down she cries herself to sleep. She no longer has any goals So many dreams she couldn't keep. Filled with so much hate wanting to get rid of this pain. Her arms are filled with scars and shes slowly going insane. Everyday when she wakes up she hates what she has to see. She turns to a blade for comfort this is all she knows how to be. Her eyes are sore from crying shes left here all alone. With scars to tell a story of how cutting was all she'd known.   (Gay, don't really like this one...but its just the story behind it that makes me want to post it on here)     Tonight I've typed out alot of the poems I like that I've written..but I haven't gone through them all...I'll post more on here when I find some more I like.  Writing is what I used to do...4 or 5 poems every other day. It was a release for me, and sometimes people don't realize that they aren't all about me. Yea, you'd think that poems where you use "I" in would be about yourself..but I used to try and write from other peoples point of view...try to know what it was like. Which ones are about me? thats something you'll have to ask me, if you want to know...otherwise I like to leave people to guess....

      Its been so long since I've wrote something on here...I'm used to writing everyday.. I don't know why...maybe because everyday there was something bothering me? I can't remember.  Right now, so much is going right....thinking that this summer is going to actually be something good!!  Already it's rocked...I've had the best day ever...the fair, fireworks, and spending the whole day with the guy I love with all my heart. Then I've worked 5 days straight (not too big of a deal, I know...but I made money, that I needed.) Then last night, had a lot of fun with friends up at the hill... danced, drank a little...just hung out...good times.  I don't know why things feel so good all of the sudden. I mean, when I'm with him...everything always feels right...everything is right, he just makes it that way. I mean, the only bad thing I've thought about lately...was what it would be like if he broke up with me, if I lost him...and what its going to be like at this time next year...most likely not this fun...just because he'll be leaving... the one person I love moving to the city. It's going to be hard even if we aren't together...seeing the person who made my life worthwhile..the person who made me like myself again..leaving here, with any chance of us getting back together...gone.  Woah...not good...I'm not going to think about this now...too happy to bring myself down with thoughts about times..that are a year away...I'll just think about him..thats always good!   I love him so much..and he knows it:p lol  I love spending time with him...even if it is just going for a walk. I feel horrible when I can't...not just because I wanted to see him...but because I know it bothers him when we can't see each other..I hate letting him down...I don't know, again, not a good thing to talk about...I'll just get upset.  I just hope we stay together for a LONG time...I'll say forever, even if it sounds crazy..but thats what I feel right now. Thats how good he makes me feel..thats how good hes made my life.   The first two weeks of this summer aren't going to be too exciting...the good thing..I'll still be around Josh..but Holly won't be around, and neither will Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn's gone to toronto for two weeks...and the Holly is at peace gardens. But oh well, Dauphin will still be fun even if my two best girls aren't around.  When Holly gets back into Dauphin, we're doing our new summer tradition and I'm going with her to the lake for a week. Its always so much fun...we walk around, go swimming..go boating. Just fun stuff, like campfires and all that. Its really relaxing.. I know that last year when we went there it really calmed me down...got me away from all the stress I was facing at home..Maybe I'll get a tan this year?lol.. I'm excited to go again..the only thing I'm going to hate is not talking to Josh at all for a week...I'm used to talking to him on the phone or at least on the internet everyday... But its just a week right? hopefully it won't be too bad! :)  Another good thing that's happened...Holly's going out with Matt!! :) I'm so happy for her...he seems like such a nice guy, and thats exactly what Holly needs...a nice guy in her life! I hope things work out for them...shes one of my best girls...and he's friends with Josh..its kind of cool. lol  Now I'm just babbling on about nothing...I think I'm going to finally stop typing...

       I hurt myself today    To see if I still feel    I focus on the pain    The only thing that's real    The needle tears a hold    The old familiar sting    Try to kill it all away    But I remember everything   What have I become    My sweetest friend    Everyone I know    goes away    In the end    And you could have it all    My empire of dirt       I will let you down         I will make you hurt   I wear this crown of thorns    Upon my liar's chair    Full of broken thoughts    I cannot repair    Beneath the stains of time    The feelings disappear    You are someone else    I am still right here   What have I become    My ssweetest friend    Everyone I know    goes away    In the end    And you could have it all    My empire of dirt    I will let you down    I will make you hurt   If I could start again    A million miles away    I would keep myself    I would find a way

          Sitting here.   Listening to some Dennis Leary comedy.   It never fails to amuse me.       Can't sleep.     Need more coffee.       The reason I can't sleep isn't because    I had a large french vanilla cappucino at 11:30 at night.   Well, maybe part of the reason.      My mind is just to full and crazy   to go to sleep.      I went to his house tonight.    It was fun.   I love spending time with him.   He's so important to me.   But I guess it still bothers me what he said.   The possibility of him moving to the city before school starts.   Okay, so he said that as long as we're together   that he won't move there.   But what if he changes his mind in like...2 weeks?   He says it won't happen.   But how does he know?      I can't imagine him leaving.   I don't want to ever lose him.   He's just too important to me. Without him...       I'd be so lost feeling.       I know exactly how I'd react...   not something I want to say though.   Because as far as I know   I'd just make him feel guilty if he's still considering moving.   Anyway I guess I've just been    going through the possibilities since I got home.      And also the thing he mentioned about not going to university once he graduates!   That he'd stay around here or work for a couple years first   just so he could be with me.      I'd feel bad if he did that.   As much as I love and care about him,   I can't have him changing his life like that for me.      I mean, if we're still together by that time...   then I'm going to work hard to make   the long distance thing work.   Even if he'd be @ school 3 hours away.      I just don't want him to fuck things up   for himself   just because of me, you know?         Okay, so I know he's reading all this.   And me still worrying or thinking about this stuff might sound stupid   after the talk we had.       But I just don't want to lose him.       So I'm sorry if it bothers you that I'm    Overthinking it all or whatever.       Hm.       I think I'm going to try and go to sleep now.   I need to sleep.      Its worth a try.      And who knows, maybe I'll be calm and okay    and all that tomorrow.   Maybe it won't bother me as much.       Maybe...

       Kay seriously I have to make up my mind.   This is just stupid.   I know what I want.....   its obvious to me at some times...   but its like...when I get the chance   I back off.   I don't want to back off anymore.   Like I said   I know what I want   so why does it have to seem so    complicated?   I think the main problem   is I don't want to end up like a few    people I know did.   Its a big thing to me I guess   Is that wrong?   I don't know.   Its like its expected of me now.   My friends think so.   Well some of them do.   But I think that I'm    the only one who actually know what I want   to do.   The question is,   do I let people know   .....   do I act on it   .....   what move do I make now?   I know what I want.   I mean...how could I not want to?   Dammit.   This is when I need to talk to Chris.   She'd help me probably more   than anyone could.   She'd understand.   Because I know my friends   don't understand!   I just have to make my decision final.   I know what I want...      so what next?

      Actually this is a couple entries...some are very short....then theres one long one on my whole ReLiGiOn thing (if you know me, you know how I am about the subject).    "Darkness lingers     but always surrenders to loving.     Darkest Midnight     is swallowed in oceans of laughter.     ..................     Verse from a song I've made Holly sing over and over. Beautiful song from what I've heard. Beautiful lyrics. Must download. Lind of depressing sounding. Perfect.          I've drank so much tea on this trip. Read so many pages of a book. Thought so many thoughts about so many things. This is what the lake does to me.]              Religion            God. Does he or doesn't he exist? I know that for the longest time I said there was no God. Not having something to believe in is lonely. So do I think there is a God? Yes. But I don't pray. I don't have faith. He hurt me. He let me hurt myself. He let me hurt inside. When I prayed he didn't listen. He didn't guide me. He was useless. God doesn't care about me. I don't care about him. The only thing he's given me in the past two years was Josh. But until you make all the hurt go away I won't have faith in you an dI won't pray to you God. Simple as that or as difficult as that. Whichever way you take it. Believing in you didn't get me anywhere.

          Finally back on my blog.    I missed writing on here.    I was out at the lake for I think 8 days. I missed writing on here so much that I bought a new journal to write in. It was so much fun. I went with Holly and her family...just like last year. It was alot of fun. We went swimming, and I ate way too much junk food. Yep, good summer trip.      Actually, not the last trip either. In a week I'm going camping with my mom and dad for 3 days. Then once I get home, I'm going to the city with my Grandma to see family...my big bro (who I miss like CRAZY right about now) and a few other relatives. It should be a fun way to end the summer.      I got a good amount of time to think about everything when I was out @ the lake for the past week. I figured out some personal problems...talked to Holly about things I wasn't sure I could talk about. It helped.      When I was out @ the lake....I missed him soooo much!!!!!! I don't think I've gone that long without seeing him or talking to him. When I got home I saw him for maybe 5 minutes...god was it good to see his face...to hug him. It was so comforting I guess you could say.      I'm going out tonight for coffee with him after he gets off work. Maybe get a chance to talk about some things that came up last night when we were kind of fighting. Over MSN....not a fun way to have a serious conversation.      But things should be good. On Wednesday I'm going to be hanging out with him too so I'll get a chance to be alone with him...just be with him. I missed that. Its crazy how easily I can start missing being in his arms.      I think I'm going to post an entry from my journal on here....
