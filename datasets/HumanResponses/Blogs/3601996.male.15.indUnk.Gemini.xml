      You can't just say to yourself that things are okay because they aren't. They will never be okay until you put them to eternal rest. You must forget and shallow the pain pretending as if it's a watermelon without any seeds. And so I say to you move on to a new beginning and leave behind your old trail map for someone else to pick up and try to follow in your footsteps to achieve the goal that you easily lost.

      As I sit here on a humid night I realize that thinGs pass bY quiCker thaN expected...When all your fun has gone you sit in a dark place with no one to occupy your brain...it almost feels Like death but in reality your just another step away from taking youR next breath...as the dayS go On you will realize where did all that time go...and Then IT hitS you...itS been by YOUR side through thick and thin...

      never believe the rich listen to what the poor have to say for they know the meaning of life  never tell the truth always tell lies for the truth may hurt more  break the law at your own free will let nothing stop you always persist no matter what it takes you must sacrifice and hold on to your inner-self cause thats your first priority  you come first and only you all your friends are not your friends for they will stab you in the back when you need them most they will turn there heads away when you need them most but they will always come to you when they need you most...
