      Hans Blix told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that...  1. "I place my trust in the multilateralism of Democratic candidate John Kerry"  2. "And in any event, I think that the whole world should vote on 2 November because so much depends on the outcome of that vote"  Note to Hans- Keep what is yours to youself, and let the American's vote, because I don't think American's try to vote in Italian or French elections.

       I recently heard it reported that some 125,000 of 140,000 American troops in Iraq are white Christians. Add to that the undoubtedly large number who are black (or other-hued) Christians, and you are forced to conclude that our volunteer military is composed almost exclusively of Christians.           Which doesn't exactly suprise me. What does suprise me is when the anti-Christian secularists who benefit most from such an arrangement fail to leave well enough alone. Like when Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin came under heavy media fire last fall for speaking publicly (in church) about the War on Terror in terms that cast it as a battle between God and Satan. Or last April, when the ACLU began maneuvering to ban the voluntary lunchtime prayer that has been a tradition at the Naval Academy since its founding.          You'd think even liberals would have the sense to realize that if a man is willing to put his life on the line to protect you from ruthless savages like Osama bin Laden, maybe it's not such a great idea to complain about why he's willing to take such a risk, or about the prayers he may say before, during or after. But then, assuming good sense on the part of liberals is never a safe bet.          So I was thinking, just as a little stunt: what if Christians threatened to boycott the armed forces until liberals ceased their anti-Christian carping? Don't you think, faced with no alternative but joing the military themselves, they'd shut up pretty quickly? Come to think of it, maybe Christians should up the ante and demand that unless and until liberals lay down their figurative armas in their "culture war" against Christiany, Christian soilders will lay down their literal arms in the real war against terrorism.          Like I say: Just as a little stunt, to shock the liberals back to their senses. And maybe even may them count their blessings.

       The Great Communicator in his own words   "We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them -- this morning, as they prepared for their journey, and waved good-bye, and "slipped the surly bonds of earth" to "touch the face of God." (Speech about the Challenger disaster).  "The best social program is a productive job for anyone who's willing to work."  "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help."   "A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his."  "I hope you're all Republicans." (to surgeons as he entered the operating room following his assassination attempt)  "Our friends in the other party will never forgive us for our success, and are doing everything in their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression, filled with suffering and despair. I don't know about you, but I'm getting awfully tired of the whining voices from the White House these days. They're claiming there was a decade of greed and neglect, but you and I know better than that. We were there."  "A leader, once convinced a particular course of action is the right one, must have the determination to stick with it and be undaunted when the going gets rough"

       Reagan's Farewell Letter To The American People In 1994   The text of Ronald Reagan's November, 1994 farewell letter to the American people after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease...  My Fellow Americans,  I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer’s Disease.  Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way.  In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result many more people underwent testing.   They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.  So now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.  At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue to share life’s journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters.  Unfortunately, as Alzheimer’s Disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage.  In closing let me thank you, the American people for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.  I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.  Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.  Sincerely,   Ronald Reagan

      On Friday, the American public recieved additional conformation that the U.S. economy is out of the rut of a recession and has bounced back strong since 9/11. Basic economics says that economies have ups and downs, recessions and recoveries. We just happen to be on the upward trend. This issue of the economy is often made into a huge partisan, political issue. As if the president can have do so much. American's should welcome the good news on job growth, but not set sights on politicizing this (even though it always will). We should neither blast George Bush on the economy when it is not at its best, but not give all the credit to Bush when the economy is on an upswing (though I believe tax cuts have helped the transition).  According to MSNBC, "the government reported a blowout employment number Friday, marking the third straight month of strong job gains". 248,000 Jobs were addded in May, spiking up the total in '04 to 1.2 million. “These blowout numbers so far this year are the convincing evidence that the economic recovery is here to stay,” Wells Fargo chief economist Sung Won Sohn said. The unemployment rate held at 5.6. This boom, which exceeded most analysts' predictions, likely confirms that the Fed will raise interest rates soon. The good news was even more satisfying that all sectors gained job, even the manufacturing market at 32,000. The manufacturing sector has had 4 straight months of payroll increases, after three continuous years of losses. "What is really key is that every major sector had improvements," said John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia Securities. "That suggests these gains are sustainable."  Bush still is on pace to be the first president since the Great Depression to have lost jobs during his watch but those losses are shrinking. His administration was widely criticized for an overly optimistic forecast that 2.6 million new jobs would be created this year. But economists now say the chugging economy could approach that mark. "I'm pleased to see strong job growth and that's what I am concerned about," said Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. "Every month of strong job growth is good news to me and it's good news for America."    urlLink    The graphic tracks the unemployment picture for the past year. (AP Graphic)  &nbsp; urlLink       Funniest, Biased News Title of the Day -   "U.S. gains jobs, but Tenet's job loss grabs the headlines"---CNN.com   Here's the newest W. ad on the Economy...This is a pretty solid one backed by facts, just adds a hit on Kerry at the end about still complaing about our "bad" economy.       The Bush Boom  ---From Best of the Web Today by WSJ June 4th, 2004 More good economic news, for everyone but the Bush-haters: The U.S. economy added some 248,000 jobs in May, according to government figures. The Associated Press reports:  Payrolls swelled by almost 1 million in the last three months alone, the Labor Department said Friday. Employment figures for March and April were revised up to reflect the addition of 353,000 and 346,000 jobs respectively.  On his campaign Web site, John Kerry promises to create 10 million new jobs during his four-year term as president. That's a rate of 625,000 every three months, or only 66% of the past three months' performance under President Bush. Can we really afford to elect someone who sets his sights so low?

      Very Touching and Well Deserved Ending to the last chapter. All the eulogy's were so magnificent in my opinion.   President George W. Bush's  urlLink Tribute   This is the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's  urlLink Tribute  to Ronald Reagan, which was really touching with a dose of laughter...  In the spring of 1987 President Reagan and I were driven into a large hangar at the Ottawa Airport, to await the arrival of Mrs. Reagan and my wife, Mila, prior to departure ceremonies for their return to Washington. We were alone except for the security details.  President Reagan's visit had been important, demanding and successful. Our discussions reflected the international agenda of the times: The nuclear threat posed by the Soviet Union and the missile deployment by NATO; pressures in the Warsaw pact, challenges resulting from the Berlin Wall and the ongoing separation of Germany; and bilateral and hemispheric free trade.  President Reagan had spoken to Parliament, handled complex files with skill and good humor - strongly impressing his Canadian hosts - and here we were, waiting for our wives.  When their car drove in a moment later, out stepped Nancy and Mila - looking like a million bucks. As they headed towards us, President Reagan beamed, threw his arm around my soldier and said with a grin: "You know, Brian, for two Irishmen we sure married up." In that visit - in that moment - one saw the quintessential Ronald Reagan - the leader we respected, the neighbor we admired and the friend we loved - a president of the United States of America whose truly remarkable life we celebrate in this magnificent cathedral today.  Presidents and prime ministers everywhere sometimes wonder how history will deal with them.  Some can even evince a touch of the insecurity of Thomas d'Arcy McGee, an Irish immigrant to Canada, who became a Father of our Confederation. In one of his poems, McGee, thinking of his birthplace, wrote poignantly: "Am I remembered in Erin I charge you, speak me true Has my name a sound, a meaning In the scenes my boyhood knew." Ronald Reagan will not have to worry about Erin because they remember him well and affectionately there. Indeed they do: from Erin to Estonia, from Maryland to Madagascar from Montreal to Monterey. Ronald Reagan does not enter history tentatively - he does so with certainty and panache. At home and on the world stage, his were not the pallid etchings of a timorous politician. They were the bold strokes of a confident and accomplished leader.  Some in the West during the early 1980s believed communism and democracy were equally valid and viable. This was the school of "moral equivalence." In contrast Ronald Reagan saw Soviet communism as a menace to be confronted in the genuine belief that its squalid underpinning would fall swiftly to the gathering winds of freedom. Provided, as he said, that NATO and the industrialized democracies stood firm and united. They did. And we know now who was right.  Ronald Reagan was a president who inspired his nation and transformed the world. He possessed a rare and prized gift called leadership - that ineffable and sometimes magical quality that sets some men and women apart so that millions will follow them as they conjure up grand visions and invite their countrymen to dream big and exciting dreams.  I always thought that President Reagan's understanding of the nobility of the presidency coincided with the American dream.  One day President Mitterrand in referring to President Reagan said: "Il a vraiment la notion de l'Etat." Rough translation: "He really has a sense of the State about him." The translation does not fully capture the profundity of the observation: what President Mitterrand meant was that there is a vast difference between the job of president and the role of president.  Ronald Reagan fulfilled both with elegance and ease, embodying himself that unusual alchemy of history, tradition, achievement, inspiration, conduct and national pride that define the special role the president of the United States must assume at home and around the world. "La notion de l'Etat" - no one understood it better than Ronald Reagan and no one more eloquently summoned his nation to high purpose or brought forth the majesty of the presidency and made it glow, better than the man who saw his country as a "shining city on a hill" May our common future and that of our great nations be guided by wise men and women who will remember always the golden achievements of the Reagan era and the success that can be theirs if the values of freedom and democracy are preserved, unsullied and undiminished, until the unfolding decades remember little else.  I have been truly blessed to have had a friend like Ronald Reagan. I am grateful that our paths crossed and that our lives touched. I shall always remember him with deepest admiration and affection and I shall always feel honored by the journey we traveled together in search of better and more peaceful tomorrows for all God's children, everywhere.  And so, in the presence of his beloved and indispensable Nancy, his children, family, friends and the American people he so deeply revered, I say "au revoir' today to a gifted leader, historic president and gracious human being. And I do so with a line from Yeats, who wrote: "Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say - my glory was that I had such friends."

      With the Democratic Party increasingly perceived as more pro-Palestinian than supportive of Israel, several leaders in the Jewish community are backing Republicans.   The Hill reports the defections have Democrats in the Senate in a tizzy, trying to re-assure Jewish donors that they're more pro-Israel than they act.   Though Jews comprise little more than 2 percent of Americans, they are concentrated in areas such as Florida and Ohio, which are battleground states.   Before Mc-Cain-Feingold, the mother of all campaign legislation fiascoes, as much as 70 percent of the Democratic Party's donations came from Jewish contributors.   Since the 2000 election - and Sept. 11 - Jewish support for Republicans has been climbing.   And Sen. John Kerry has not done his party any favors with antagonistic remarks about Israel's security fence protecting it from West Bank suicide bombers.   Some significant defectors from the Democrats include: American Jewish Congress president Jack Rosen, a former big donor to the Democrats, has contributed $100,000 to Republicans since George W. Bush was inaugurated.   And California's Ronald and Dawn Arnall, who previously handed over nearly $1.5 million to Democrats, have surpassed Pioneers and Rangers by raising $1 million for W, besides plunking down $1 million of their own dough to the Republican National Committee.   "Democrats do not speak with a unified voice on Israel anymore," said Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the only Jewish Republican in the House of Representatives.   "The Democrats want to re-inject the United States in to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a neutral arbiter and neutral voice."

      "George W. Bush could eventually end up joining the ranks of the greats. The three great presidents have three things in common: All faced unprecedented challenges, all responded to them boldly, and all ultimately were successful. Mr. Bush so far meets two of these criteria: History dealt him an unprecedented challenge in the form of the 9/11 attacks, and no one can deny that he answered it with boldness. If he is able to overcome the current troubles in Iraq, and if he succeeds in his mission of combating Islamist terror by promoting democracy in the Middle East, history will be far kinder to him than are his contemporary critics." --BY JAMES TARANTO  Mr. Taranto at the WSJ makes a good point that many scholars have not been addressing. It will be interesting to see 30 years from now, how the textbooks and history view Bush. If Iraq's security improves (it is slowly but surely currently) and a true Democratic governent is setup, he could become one of the "best presidents". I truely believe that. By the end of presidency, Bush would have started to change the face of the Middle East, get the economy back on track after 9/11 and recession, set a solid plan of countering terrorism. President Bush has also faced unprecedented, bitter, partisan hatred during his term (leaving some to say that he was "controvercial").  The importance of his presidency ranks up there with FDR, Kennedy, LBJ, Reagan. Like FDR, Bush had to lead the country in a straight moral path after 9/11 and face reality. Like Kennedy and Reagan, who had to face communism and the Soviet Union, now the enemy that must be wiped out are terrorist cells...

Clinton had a lot of tea parties with celebrities, but right after his term, somebody flew two planes into the Twin Towers.

Well, you can see why the strippers would really be for John Kerry. I mean they have almost as many positions as he does." —Jay Leno  "According to USA Today, the Kerry campaign now has $28 million dollars in the bank. After hearing this, Mrs. Kerry said, 'That is so cute.'" —Conan O'Brien  "This is so weird.

      By W.C.  The title just about sums it all up. So they finally blew. Blew up, that is. Not surprisingly, it was CBS’s top anchor, Dan Rather along with Tom Brokaw. On the "excessive" Reagan coverage, Rather said “life goes on”, “There is other news, like the reality of Iraq”. Then added, “Once the herd starts moving in one direction, it's very hard to turn it, even slightly”. How true, doesn’t that remind you of the Abu Ghraib abuse coverage or the media hovering like savages over the “Daily Death Toll” in Iraq? Dan, if only you had the credibility, maybe we’d believe you. Dan, when's the last time CBS looked to find out what was  really  going on in the rebuilding of Iraq's infastructure? Instead you like to over-cover the 9/11 commission, and then only to put who on TICK TICK TICK 60 minutes? Clarke? To promote his book? The next Friday, Newsweek and Time magazine had front covers asking, How will the 9/11 commission effect the elections? Ha ha, wasn't that a little overcovered. You deserved the backlash CBS.  You can just feel all these media elites cringing every day this week. I can see Rather saying to his producer, give me some Abu Ghraib pictures d@mNit! No more reading Reagan accomplishments! Arrr....can we just slip something about Reagan being stupid or rasist in the script somewhere? If there aren't any naked pictures or dogs on leashes, then we'll ask our European friends for some fake photos right? At least Peter Jennings didn't go overboard like Rather.  Hypocricy, at its best...

Hollywood's newest nonconformist is a former star of "The Practice," Lara Flynn Boyle.    The actress has stepped forward to pledge her support for the current object of Hollywood's disaffection, President Bush.   Boyle has been busy since the cancellation of "The Practice" working on a recurring role in a new Showtime drama called "Huff." She portrays a manic-depressive patient of the title character. Showtime plans to debut the series in November.   "I'm Irish Catholic, so a Democrat by blood. But I'm 100 percent for Bush. I want my president to be like my agent: not afraid of people, but wants my best interest," Boyle told World Entertainment News Network.

      Many Democrats, including Walter Mondale, Bill Clinton, John Kerry and even Ted Kennedy, had gracious things to say about President Reagan. Even Jimmy Carter tried, as we noted yesterday. But The American Spectator's "Washington Prowler" notes some very small-minded behavior at party HQ (second item):  In Washington, staffers at the Democratic National Committee stopped a couple of interns who were lowering the flags to half mast outside their headquarters.  "The interns were just doing what they thought was right," says a DNC staffer, who heard about the incident. "But somebody a bit more senior told them not to lower the flags until they absolutely had to, I guess when President Bush announced that all flags should be lowered. There was only an hour's difference. It was pretty petty, but that's how bad things have gotten around here."  It's kind of funny that the Dems were waiting for orders from George W. Bush, of all people. Blogger  urlLink Tom McMahon , meanwhile, raises a good question: How come there's not a word about Reagan's death on the Web site of  urlLink General Electric , which employed him for years as a spokesman and actor?

Using the suffering of Mrs. Reagan to build up support against Mr. Bush's policy on embryonic research.  5. Along with the Times,  urlLink Dianne Feinstein, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Tom Harkin, and the RINO (Republican in name only) Arlen Specter signed a letter to President Bush to "ease restrictions" on stem cell research. To them, this is the positive part about Reagan's passing, to further their political goals.    **Update #1** On # 4 with the NY Times, Times Watch just put  urlLink this response  to the same article...  **Update #2** This is what some one posted on this  urlLink site  on Reagan. "Ronald Reagan wasn't a wonderful president.  He wasn't the best and he wasn't the worst.  He doesn't make it in the top ten of either category.  I believe him to be a bad president, but there have been plenty worse."

      From this....   urlLink    FDR&nbsp; urlLink      To this....   urlLink    The Leader of the Left- Hollywood Fanatic Michael Moore&nbsp; urlLink     The liberalism we are witnessing in the modern era (last 5 decades) is one with sketches of anti-Americanism, Communism, sedition, treason, and fanaticalness. The left now is more willing to show their inner self? Reveal it all out? Anyways, they've given conservatives so many 30 second soundbites to laugh at them. The Hollywood elite aren't afraid to share their thoughts, and Al Gore seems to rant like a mad-man once a month from the radical moveon.org group, not to mention Hillary/Teddy Kennedy/or Howard Dean. Add in a little George Soros and they have a beautiful diversity in spreading their propoganda.

       Machine Gun Cheney   Newsmax.com Insider Report E-mail  Dick Cheney is a proud gun owner and hunter.   In April the Vice President addressed the NRA to wild cheers and acknowledged his own interest in guns.   But a source close to the White House tells NewsMax that Dick Cheney is a true gun aficionado.   Cheney's collection, our sources say, is in the  hundreds of guns, including pistols, shotguns and machine guns -- from antique Thompsons to the most modern European automatic machine guns.   To let off some steam (God knows he has some to let off these days), the Vice President has been known to go out to the federal training center in Maryland where the Secret Service does its own gun practice.   A typical Cheney visit, told to us by a person who attended one, included the Vice President  bringing some 30 guns from his own collection .   On the ranger,  Cheney would blow away his targets -- with Thompson machine guns, the latest German and Austrian machine guns, Lugars, MP5s, shot guns, you name it .   One after another an aide would hand the Vice President his latest armament, and Cheney would fire away, no doubt imagining al-Qaeda terrorists in his gun sights.   We're told Cheney is a good shot to boot.    Cheney is not shy about his shooting activities . Another Cheney friend tells us that at the Cheneys' Christmas party last year he  showcased to guests a video of himself shooting while hunting.    You probablly see why I almost fell off my chair reading this. Hundreds of guns? Wow.

      Don't we all feel sorry for the liberals in their newsrooms at NBC, ABC, and CBS? On  urlLink Drudge Sunday night , Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan Speechwriter and CBS employee explained how the media feels about covering Reagan. Reagan, the man who was no shy from speaking the truth out was just hated by liberals and the press. They thought he was going to start a World War 3 with his brashness, thought he was just an actor that would be easily beaten in National Elections, and he was just a cowboy type. When he walked out on a meeting with Mikail Gorbachev, liberals were stunned that Reagan would choose to deal with foreign leaders in such a black/white way. The underestimated Reagan, and continue to underestimate Bush. And that could be a good thing come Nov. 2nd. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 Terms after Reagan produced George W. Bush. When the threat of terrorism was clearly no longer a "law-enforcement" issue, he went out a sought the "rogue nations" that provided a safe haven for them. With an unwaivering position, he called those countries out in front of the entire world. "States like (Iraq, Iran, & North Korea), and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world." he declared in the SOTU Speech, 1/29/02. Showing clarity on his position on the enemy, he added on September 20, 2001, "We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them." Reagan made no distinction in our eneimes and the threats to the world. He called the Soviet Union the "Empire of Evil" and followed his principles, decimating the Soviets and succeeding in winning the final chapter of the Cold War. Neither Reagan or Bush believe(d) that America is superior to any other nation, but that America was strong, too great for small dreams, America was too strong with the will and moral courage of free men and women.  Liberals are now "forced" to play the role of nice kid and praise Reagan. But the main principles Reagan stood for, are the ones that George Bush stand for. A strong national defense, provide tax relief, a strong foreign policy, cherishing freedom, and defeating evil. The Left loved to trash Reagan, just like they do to President Bush these days.  **Update #1**   urlLink What a coincidence, just got an article in my e-mail on Reagan/Bush    urlLink Also, here's another article from CS Monitor on Reagan's impact on the GOP

      Senator Hillary Clinton of New York said she was "grateful" for her chance to participate in the state funeral of former President Ronald Reagan as "it represented the first time since the conception of Chelsea that Bill and I have slept together."   The televised funeral gave the Democratic senator a chance to re-establish closeness, if not intimacy, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, she told reporters at her Washington office this morning. "It was great, nostalgic, a trip down memory lane" she continued. "Sleeping with Bill was always a lot of fun, as I recall. And hopefully, we'll have a similar opportunity in the future, either on the solemn occasion of someone else's death or at an inaugural ball."   Bill and Hillary Clinton managed to get some much-needed shut eye at the National Cathedral, sleep they both needed in advance of a gruelling book tour and a tough campaign season. "Oh, and Reagan was a lovely man," Senator Clinton added.   If you liked this piece, check out  urlLink Broken Newz  and the rest of their funny works...

       urlLink    Some Respect for Reagan, huh?&nbsp; urlLink     Courtesy of  urlLink Drudge Report   That's what made me and a lot of conservatives mad at Bush kissing up to the Clinton's. Man, come on, Slick Willie is the man who was classless, sold nuclear secrets to China, rented out the Lincoln bedroom for his "rich" contributers, and dirtied the name of the Presidency. Clinton has about zero respect for anyone that doesn't have a last name of Clinton. Just look at him and Hillary snoozing through Reagan's funeral. If I was in Bush's position, the last thing I would do is to kiss CLinton's ego in front of the world, after his harsh (and deservedly so) remarks on Bill Clinton in 2000. Comeon, most conservatives believe Clinton should be sitting in a jail cell right now! One day, George Bush has to learn that if he plays nice, the left wing media and elite will still bash him.

       urlLink Listen to a Mark Levin vs. Michael Newdow Shootout on the Sean Hannity Show   The Supreme Court upheld the phrase "Under God" in the Pledge, at least for now. Michael Newdow did not have custody of his daughter, and therefore the case was "thrown out" The little good news in my opinion was that Clarance Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor, and William H. Rehnquist wrote and said that Pledge as recited by schoolchildren did not violate the Constitution. Throw in justice Antonin Scalia, and you have 4 justices that have affirmed the phrase "Under God" as constitutional. One reason to re-elect President Bush is affirmed here. Over the next few years, there will probablly be a few Supreme Court openings. President Bush has not been shy of putting conservative and God-fearing judges in our courts.  I'm warning you, the athiests, ACLU, and NEA will not stop at attacking the flag, our national motto, and our historical roots (The Constitution). This time, Newdow was beaten 8-0 but don't expect it to go away any time soon. "The fact that the majority of the supreme court did not address the issue of whether or not the phrase is Constitutional and only ruled that the father does not have the legal standing to raise the issue leaves the door open to further challenges," said Ricardo Soto of the San Diego Unified School District. If they conquer taking away "Under God" references, the next step is to rip off all the crosses on Churches, then they will take away our National Motto. These arrogant and hypocrites on the Left promote tolerance but then turn around and drag their ideological enemies to the ground. Already, we have seen Federal Judge Myron Thompson rule to throw the Ten Commandments, the foundation of U.S. Law and the Constitution out on the street.

      Asian American's have a true, natural residency in the Republican Party. They tend to be very patriotic, as immigrants who have chosen to come here and then succeed through excellence, quality, and virtue. Asian's are probablly the most socially conservative group in the world, neverless America. The main values that Republican's bring out and cherish are the same values that Asian American's hold dearly- hard work, prudence, belif in self, self-gratification. But currently, only 30-35% of the Asian Vote goes to Republican's. This number should be much higher, as an Asian American pundit Dinesh D'Souza says, up to 90%. As an American Asian myself, it is very suprising that the majority American Asian vote goes to the other Parties, and not the Republican Party. The core values and spirit of Republican's and conservatives is parallel to the endearing values that Asian American's also hold.  Getting a majority vote of the American Asian population would help Republian's to hold their majority status and essentially win every election.

      "Conservatives complain about institutional bias in Hollywood. They need to stop whining and get out there and produce." said Jim Hubbard.  "Conservative messages don't have a chance in contemporary Hollywood," filmaker Jason Apuzzo said. "But there's another side in Hollywood. We are small in numbers but passionate."  Apuzzo is right on target in response to the crazy idea that conservatives are "whining" and need to "get out there and produce". There is no Conservative voice in Hollywood. If you are in the Homosexual Lobby, you'll be treated better that if you were a Republican or have a Conservative message. I like to compare today's Conservative Voice in Hollywood to the past, in the 50's and 60's. Back then, if you were a communist, you had better keep quiet and people were often blacklisted and lost their jobs. Now, if you are a conservative, thats pretty much the same. The rich and powerful in Hollywood will see that you crumble and won't stop from making you a failure till you are on your knees. You can add the Jason Apuzzo to the short list of conservatives in Hollywood... 1. Mel Gibson 2. Bruce Willis 3. Dennis Miller 4. Jason Apuzzo

      By this time, even Democrats have to admit Al Gore has lost it, and it's good that he's not using these tactics in the Oval Office. Rest assured. Al Gore isn't really worth talking about, he's just gone off into another planet, the Michael M. Franken planet. Al Gore is like your little pesky brother that won't go away even though he loses at everything and then goes crazy in front of your parents. Some statements in his wacked off tirade.  "They dare not admit the truth lest they look like complete fools for launching our country into a reckless, discretionary war against a nation that posed no immediate threat to us whatsoever,"   "So when the bipartisan 9/11 commission issued its report finding 'no credible evidence' of an Iraq-al-Qaida connection, it should not have come as a surprise. It should not have caught the White House off guard."  Accused Bush of abusing his presidential powers by invading Iraq without a war declaration from Congress, allowing Americans deemed "unlawful enemy combatants" to be held without being charges, and authorizing "what plainly amounts to the torture of prisoners."   I liked this line by the AP....  Still popular among Democrats , Gore is an important ally for Kerry because he  can criticize Bush in harsher terms than Kerry , this year's Democratic presidential candidate. Aides said  Kerry must temper his critiques of Bush to avoid alienating the independent and swing voters who will influence the outcome on Nov. 2

      Dictator Fidel Castro warned President Bush about not launching a military attack on Cuba, "saying it would provoke a mass exodus and an all-out ground war".    "You would never be able to win that war," the Cuban leader said. "Here you will not find a divided people."    Castro understands that America is divided right now, that winning a war takes unilateral strength. Unfortunatly, the Democrats such as Ted Kennedy don't see that we must win the war (on terror). Instead they focus and dwell on the more insignificant of things...

      "We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And the war [has] been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism."- Iyad Allawi  "Prime minister, I’m surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida." Tom Brokhaw in response to Allawi's statement, but Allawi stood firmly:  "No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. We know Saddam had relationships with a lot of terrorists and international terrorism. Now, whether he is directly connected to the September atrocities or not, I can’t vouch for this. But definitely I know he has connections with extremism and terrorists."- Iyad Allawi  "We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam's involvement with al-Qaeda," he told the London Telegraph. "But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far. It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al-Qaeda, he had contact with those responsible for the September 11 attacks." - (Commenting on a recently discovered Iraqi intelligence document placing lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta in Baghdad two months before the attacks) - Iyad Allawi

      This week, three big-name liberals have taken the spotlight off John Kerry. Does it matter? Let's take a quick look.   #1 -- Bill Clinton: The intern-touching, under-oath-lying, pseudo-moderate, impeached former President made a major media blitz this week with the release of his seemingly never-ending autobiography. Though no one is sure that a single word in the perjurer's tome can be believed, he's making the television rounds nonetheless. Some have argued that such spotlight-hogging is bad for John Kerry because it reminds the country of the corruption that existed (still exists) in the Democratic Party when Clinton was running the show . . . which many claim he is still doing. However, we must remember that even though Clinton's out there reminding America of how corrupt politicians can be, Kerry's poll numbers over this campaign have tended to improve when he's not out front.  #2 -- Michael Moore: The not-so-svelte movie maker has really been eating up the limelight with the domestic release this week of his -- as the Seattle Times called it -- docu-satire, "Fahrenheit 9/11." People everywhere, from the Right and the Left, have ridiculed the movie's outlandish accusations, half-truths, lies, cheap shots, and all-around nonsensical blather. Some may think that it would hurt the Democratic candidate by making all liberals look as silly as Michael Moore, but Kerry can benefit. How? Now every negative thing Kerry says about the war in Iraq, Bush's handling of 9/11, and the War on Terror will sound reasonable compared to the Moore screed.  #3 -- Al Gore: The former-Veep-turned-attention-deprived-loudmouth has been giving outrageous speeches blasting the Bush Administration's handling of . . . well, everything. Gore's most recent weirdness exhibition occurred yesterday at Georgetown Law School in which he likened President Bush and his supporters to Nazis and made other outlandish claims such as the notion that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are "intentionally misleading the American people" by asserting a connection between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terror network. Of course that statement runs counter to what the Clinton/Gore administration claimed in 1998: "Al Qaeda reached an understanding with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work against that government and that on particular projects, specifically including weapons development, al Qaeda would work cooperatively with the Government of Iraq." Kerry's benefit from such Gore-rants is that the Democratic liberal base's hunger for raw meat will be satiated without Kerry actually saying it. And, as with Michael Moore, Gore provides Kerry with the appearance of being mainstream: nothing he says could be seen as "radical" compared to the loud, Leftist cries from the man who would be President had he won his home state of Tennessee.

      The Ulimate Flip Flopping Machine, #1 and #4 Most Liberal Senators in the U.S. Senate   Edwards Even Acknowledged His Own Liberal Record    Edwards Could Not Recall Single Conservative Position He Has Taken As Senator. “‘I could give you an answer to that question if you give me a little time to think about it.’ - Democratic presidential aspirant Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, asked by columnist Robert D. Novak in…the American Spectator to recall any conservative position he’s taken in the U.S. Senate    Though an e-mail today, John Forbes Kerry picked up a smooth talking, good looking North Carolina Senator named John Edwards. The move was not suprising at all, as Kerry hopes Edwards' sex appeal and youth will buy him some votes (similarly to Clinton's VP choice in Al Gore). But when you look into Edwards' ideology, it is clearly disturbing.   Despite the attractiveness and youth, Edwards has no foreign policy experiance at all, is the 4th most liberal senator, and is a former trial lawyer that has put faulty evidence in his many cases which has won him hundreds of millions (many cases in which he blamed doctors for causing Cerebral Palsy). Edwards does not understand the world as it is, and believes that America is undertaxed. Even a Hillary/Kennedy ticket would be more conservative than a Kerry/Edwards ticket.  In this critical election and an everchanging world, American's should not look for a Vice President that will learn about National Security on the job.  Though many Conservatives and Republican's feared a Kerry/Edwards match, Edwards may hurt Kerry's campaign instead of helping Kerry. John Kerry got nothing of what he wanted in a Vice President (Kerry criticized Edwards for being young and inexperienced, once saying that he didn't know if Edwards was even "out of diapers" when Kerry returned from Vietnam).  Kerry was looking for a proven leader with sound judgement on National Security, economic prosperity and social justice, someone commiteed to Kerry's issues and vision for the country, compatible with Kerry on all levels, capable of inspiring confidence in voters from all parts of the country and all walks of life, and ready at any moment to assume the awesome responsibility of President. The reality is that Edwards has never made a judgment on a matter of national security in his life and is only in his first term as a U.S. senator. Edwards does not truely believe in Kerry's viewpoints because he ran against him (Kerry tossed some harsh words on Edwards and his limited experiance), Edwards could only inspire voters in his homestate and couldn't win his adopted state of North Carolina in the primaries.   If anything, Kerry desperately needed a balance and a compatable mate, but a choice of a flip flopping ultra liberal + ultra liberal populist is not the right formula for a "Better America".
