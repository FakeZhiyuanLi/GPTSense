       At least as far as customer service goes.      I recently ran into problems w/ both online companies.  A song I downloaded from Napster would not play correctly, as in, not at all!  As you have to be a premium member in order to receive phone support, I filed my report online.  After a few days of not hearing anything from them (which reflects poorly on them, but I'll let is slide...just keep reading!), I decided to find their phone number.  I found it listed on some website, so I gave them a rang.  They helped me fix my problem immediately...and w/ friendly service.      Now on to Amazon.com.  First off, I received a g.c. to this site for my birthday or Christmas (they are both around the same time), only to find out you can't use it toward everything on their site.  I'm sorry, but last time I checked, a g.c. is just like cash, except Amazon.com already has the money....so why the hell do they feel they can exclude certain items?  F-CKERS!!!  Okay, now onto the current situation...Monday, I decided to sell a few CDs that I no longer wanted (actually, it isn't that I no longer wanted the songs, I just had no use for the CD, as I uploaded all the songs onto my computer).  I logged into Amazon.com and put the items up for purchase.  I thought it odd that I did not receive a confirmation e-mail from Amazon.com Marketplace, but brushed it off convincing myself that I must have just been mistaken about receiving them in the past.  The next day, my beau calls me up saying that someone was selling stuff on his account!  It didn't register at first, but once he told me the CDs, I put two and two together (I'm just smart like that-HAHA).  Apparently, it never logged him out on my computer, eventhough I had logged him out and logged myself in.  When I never heard back from them via e-mail, I gave them a ring.  I was transferred twice, before I got handed off to some rude bitch.  She proceeded to tell me that it could not possibly have been through any fault of Amazon.com and that I must have just not logged off.  Who the F-CK does she think that I am that makes her think she can talk down to me like that?  I told her that they were lucky that it showed up on the account of someone I know, and that I was only trying to let them know of this problem.  She didn't seem to care or think that this was of any great concern.  I gave up and proceeded to put them on my list of companies not to patronize.  It is a very short list, one that includes, as many of my friends know, McDonald's (and, via association, Boston Market and Chipotle).        Maybe one day, I won't spend the entire blog bitching....but I don't see that happening any time soon.

        If you ever want to get rid of large amounts of food quickly, just set it out in the kitchen on the 14th floor. No, you don't have to send out a company-wide e-mail, as our Finance Department will be on it like Sally Struthers is on, well, just about anything edible. In fact, it should come to no surprise that most of the people in that department are the size of Ms. Struthers. Today, for instance, an admin was wheeling the remains of a catered lunch into the kitchen, but, just as she was making her way there, people from the Finance department were already making their way up. An announcement had not even been made yet, so I can only come to one conclusion....they smelled it! Impossible as it may sound, the folks in finance seem to have trained their noses to pick up on food from far away...much like a dog, except humans can train them to use their noses for far more beneficial causes. After they were finished, there was nothing but two tortillas left. I'm amazed that there was even that much left. They usually suck it dry.        Another thing, how dumb are people? I mean, I'm no genius, but I have enough common sense to have made it this far in life. Apparently, though, there are a lot of people out there who are just plain idiots. The two examples I have both revolve around signs that state the obvious. Over in tower I (for those who are not in the know, this is the Tenet building and the one connected to the building I'm in via the 2nd floor), they have glass doors leading into all of their rooms. Well, on each glass door, they have a big sign that says,  WARNING: GLASS DOOR . Now, I'm used to be warned about such things as an attack dog on premises or even a slippery floor, but what the hell is a glass door going to do to me? And why hasn't there been a cheesy B horror movie been made about a glass door that goes around killing scantily clad women (or, as I would prefer, scantily clad, well-built twenty-something guys)?  The second stupid sign was seen at the post office. That tells you a lot right there, and I'm not really surprised that I saw a sign like this there. No offense to anyone that knows someone that works for the post office or any other government worker. Anyway, the sign is displayed above the drinking fountain, and reads,  WATER FOUNTAIN FOR DRINKING PURPOSES ONLY . No  SHIT !!! This makes me wonder what other uses people have gotten out of this water fountain...and, as I'm sure is the case w/ most of you reading this, my first thought was that someone had previously urinated in it. This is another thing that alludes me. What makes people think that it is okay to urinate in public? Can they not make it to the bathroom that is only a few feet away from them? I've dated two guys that have left the club only to urinate on a car tire as soon as they walk out. First off, this is rude to the person that owns the car. Secondly, it is in bad taste when you do this in front of your date on what will become their last date w/ said date.  Til tomorrow, folks!

       I've been having flashbacks to my trips to the dentist and orthodontist yesterday and today, because they are installing some badge readers for the new office space. It isn't pleasant listening to that drilling noise all day long!  Alright, my time is up...there is never enough time to sit down and write a proper entry, so I'll probably fill this site w/ brief stories and thoughts.

       So I've decided to follow the trend and start up my very own blog. As I was telling one of my friends, I have no idea how to make my life interesting enough to sustain the short attention span of today's 18-49 demographic (incidently, the same demographic that will be reading this blog of mine...gulp). I think that I may just be setting myself up to fail miserably...and, in my typical fashion, I'll be doing it in front of all of you lovely people!
