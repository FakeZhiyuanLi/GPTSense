      Well, this is depressing. Why not put this out 'before' all the
festivities started to give people a good perspective on that weird little
thing we've lost sight of. Y'know, the  urlLink Truth ?

  urlLink Yes,
U.S. helped Iraq get chemical, biological weapons 
 Q. I have a friend trying to convince me that the United States was
at least partially responsible for giving Saddam Hussein the weapons of
mass destruction that we now have been fighting to destroy. Can he be right?
 -- E.N. of Belleville
 A. This likely will raise howls of protest from supporters of Ronald
Reagan and George Bush Sr., but your friend is essentially correct.
 You don't have to dig deep to find that from 1982 to 1990 the United
States supplied Iraq with not only conventional arms and cash but also
chemical and biological materials, including the precursors for anthrax
and botulism. It's another example of nations playing with fire when they
form dangerous alliances.
 In 1980, Iran and Iraq launched a horrendous eight-year war that would
kill at least 1 million people. With the Ayatollah Khomeini controlling
Iran, the U.S. feared a radical Islamic takeover of the region, so it began
cozying up to Saddam -- you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
 With Iran holding the upper hand in 1982, the Reagan administration
removed Iraq from the State Department's list of terrorist nations over
congressional objections. A year later, the Reagan administration issued
National Security Decision Directive 114, which stated that the United
States would do "whatever was necessary and legal" to prevent the fall
of Iraq.
 Then, just before Christmas 1983, Reagan sent Donald Rumsfeld -- yes,
the current secretary of defense -- to Baghdad to discuss resuming official
diplomatic relations with Saddam, relations that had been severed during
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
 On March 24, 1984, Rumsfeld was back in Baghdad -- the same day United
Press International reported that Iraqi soldiers had used mustard gas laced
with a nerve agent on Iranian forces. That didn't seem to matter. Even
though the State Department recognized on March 5, 1984, that "Iraq has
used lethal chemical weapons" in violation of the Geneva accords, full
diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iraq were restored in November.
 That opened the floodgates to aid from the United States. Once Iraq
was off the terrorist list, conventional military sales resumed in December
1982. It is thought that U.S.-supplied helicopters were used in the 1988
chemical attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja, which killed 5,000 Iraqis
-- the same attack frequently cited the past few months as a reason to
overthrow Saddam.
 Once diplomatic relations were restored, the Department of Agriculture
began offering guaranteed loans for food because shortages were causing
discontent among the Iraqi people. This allowed Saddam to divert money
to buy arms and "dual-use" items from not only the United States, but also
West Germany, Italy, France, England and a host of others. Best guess is
that U.S. taxpayers wound up paying $2 billion in bad Iraqi loans.
 A 1994 investigation by the Senate Bank Committee found that U.S. companies
had been licensed by the Commerce Department to export a "witch's brew"
of biological and chemical materials, including precursors of anthrax and
botulism. The report also noted the exports included plans for chemical
and biolgical warfare facilities and chemical warhead filling equipment.
 Yet even after Saddam began gassing his own people in Northern Iraq,
the flow of goods continued. In November 1989, Bush approved $1 billion
in loan guarantees for Iraq in 1990, and from July 18, 1989, to Aug. 1,
1990, the U.S. approved $4.8 million in advanced technology sales.
 "Only on Aug. 2, 1990, did the Agriculture Department officially suspend
the (loan) guarantees to Iraq -- the same day that Hussein's tanks and
troops swept into Kuwait," a Los Angeles Times expose on Feb. 23, 1992,
noted.
 Postscript: According to a Washington Post story, when United Nations
weapons inspectors were allowed into Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, they
compiled long lists of chemicals, missile components and computers from
American companies that were being used for military purposes.

Geeze...

 In Other Shite:
 Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!  urlLink Roddy
Piper , my childhood hero is on  urlLink wrestling 
again and mixing it up something perfect just like when I was a kid. Mind
you, he's toning it down a bit from when I was younger but its still good
to see something other than that gawdawful freak in the orange and yellow
strutting all over the place. It got to the point where I couldn't even
watch except during those parts when someone, be it Brock Lesnar or a four
year old kid, beat the crap out of him. Now that the Hod Rod is back, I
feel that all will be right with the world LOL.
 Finally, I can look at wrestling as something more than cheesy soap
opera like porn with the occasional good match.
 The above comments do not apply to the few good wrestlers in the mega-corporation
wrestling organization....ok, maybe they do for some but I at least respect
your wrestling skill when I'm not objectif....err I mean noticing the amount
of hard work you put into keeping yourselves fit...yeah, thats it! :p
 &nbsp;
 Daymares or Nightdreams? You Be The Judge:
 Ick, I had a series of 'dreams' about a political entity. Not sure how
to react but....no there is no right reaction for those dreams.

      After reading a few news articles with much the same kick, I guess it isn't ok to 'just be silent'
 
  
 
 
 urlLink Silent protest prompts vocal criticism  
 CYNTHIA M. ELLIS, The Telegraph
 
April 11, 2003
  ALTON -- Julie Ohley raised her voice as loud as she could Wednesday without ever saying a word.

Ohley, 17, along with about 25 other students at Alton High School, took a daylong pledge of silence to protest the hatred that lesbian, gay, bisexua land transgendered students face every day on campus and in the community.

Dressed in the colors of the rainbow from her head to her toes, Ohley spoke no words. When questioned about her silence, she simply handed individuals a small card that read: "Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am participating in the ‘Day of Silence,’ a national youth movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people and their allies. My deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by harassment, prejudice and discrimination. I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today."

The Day of Silence project, sponsored by the Gay Straight Alliance, is the first activity recognized by the school’s new organization, Promoting Respect In Students’ Minds, or PRISM.

Anita Steinmann, school guidance counselor and sponsor of PRISM, said the organization was started upon students completing the Diversity Awareness Partnership.

The Diversity Awareness Partnership is a collaboration of individuals and organizations committed to promoting the value of diversity in the St. Louis region. More than 33 schools were asked to participate in the program, which began last September.

However, the silent protest did not take place without controversy.

Ohley, a junior, wore the six colors synonymous with the gay pride flag. Her hair was tied up into pigtails held by rainbow-striped shoelaces, her fingernails were horizontally painted red, orange, yellow, green, royal blue and violet. She sported socks that looked more like gloves, with multiple-colored necklaces and bracelets a quarter of the way up her arms.

The most impressive piece of her attire was the white T-shirt Ohley hand-painted with a rainbow on the front. Written underneath were the words, "Erase the Hate."

Ohley wrote in a notebook that when she arrived at school, several students gave her dirty looks and chanted, "Gay is not OK!"

Alton High School Principal Phil Trapani said the school received dozens of telephone calls from parents and others in the community who were upset about the protest.

Trapani said there was miscommunication about the event. He said the students participating in the silent protest were promoting the rights of gay and lesbian individuals, not necessarily promoting being gay.

"To deny students sending out the message was the wrong thing to do," he said. "We are not educating our kids if we ignore diversity."

Several students said they were against the silent protest -- not against the message, but against the way the school allowed the event.

Senior Patrick Read, 18, said he was upset because the school would not allow students with opposing viewpoints to tell their points of view.

"It’s nothing against the day," Read said. "We want our right to speak out."

Read said students printed up badges that read: "United Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve."

Sophomore Jade Knight, 16, a member of PRISM, said everyone has their differences and people need to respect them.

The Day of Silence Project first was organized in 1996 at the University of Virginia. The project’s intent was designed to help end discrimination, which causes more students to remain "silent."

The rainbow has been the symbol of hope for difficult causes through the years, not just for gay pride. Each color has a separate meaning: red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sun, green for serenity with nature, royal blue for harmony and violet for spirit.

Trapani said there were many rumors about the day’s event. He said some students told their parents that they were required to participate in the day of silence, which wasn’t the case at all.

"Everything has been done in a professional manner," Trapani said.

He said the day was about promoting the respect of others, promoting the differences of people. He said after the numerous calls he received from parents, he knew some were upset.

"A lot of parents have been very understanding after they understand what we’ve done," Trapani said. "But we should have done a better job of informing the parents what was being done. I will take full responsibility. I messed up."

Now what part of this did I miss where these kids
were being disruptive?
 
What part in this story were these kids chasing
other people down and forcing them to listen to their story?
 
What part in this story were kids shooting other
kids in some angry rage?
 
Can we not as a people even be silent without
someone trying to limit our freedom of expression?
 
Mr. Trapani, you did not do the wrong thing at
all. You cannot help it if groups of bigots don't want anyone who is 'different'
from them in this world. They had their free speech and spoke it. No one
limited or even tried to limit what they said.
 
The people who are so willing to harass the free
rights of others should take a damn good look at themselves in the mirror.
They should see what they've been doing with no just cause or reason to
others who they deem to be different from them.
 
Get it through your thick heads. We have heard
the loud and crude messages. We heard the threats and taunts against our
persons. We heard and witnessed the violence commited against us and others
when we did 'just shut up' and we reject it as barbarism not fit for the
free society we're supposed to be living in.
 
To everyone who does not use these methods, please
try to understand. We're not carbon copy people. Everyone is different
and has the free right to be. I don't want to see the world were everyone
is forced to be exactly the same and I'm guessing you don't either. You
don't have to like my views or my person, but don't try to limit my rights
based on your beliefs alone.
 
I wouldn't do it to you, so don't do it to me. 
 
 In Other News:
 
Apparently the Good Chaplain did in fact save
up the water. I wrote to  urlLink Snopes  and
kept my eyes on the news articles as they came out online. He saved up
bottles of expired water for his fount of holiness. 
 
I've just got one thing to say to this...
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
  
 
 Taken from:  urlLink  Matthew
25: 31-46  
 

 
 Then he will say to those on his left,
 ‘Depart from me, you accursed,
 into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
 For I was hungry and you gave me no food,
 I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,
 a stranger and you gave me no welcome,
 naked and you gave me no clothing,
 ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.'
 Then they will answer and say,
 ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty
 or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison,
 and not minister to your needs?'
 He will answer them, ‘Amen, I say to you,
 what you did not do for one of these least ones,
 you did not do for me.'
 And these will go off to eternal punishment,
 but the righteous to eternal life."

I've finally got a  urlLink Deadjournal .
This means more of my spouting off and shouting down the moon I suppose.
 One thing I like about  urlLink Deadjournal 
is the fact that I can remotely upload my journals and that it detects
what song I'm playing on my  urlLink Winamp .
I'm probably going to put all the lurid tidbits about myself on this particular
journal LOL.
 
 Well, I need to get some sleep for today. I have a doctors appointment
in about nine hours.

      The entity finally got pissed off at being beaten intellectually.
 &nbsp;
 He sent about twenty other people and myself this nice series of notes
in the e-mail. I went through their profiles based on their e-mail addresses.
All were women, most seemingly strong-minded. This just proves my theory
that hatred comes from ignorance, so keep on learning Citizens of Earth
until stuff like this gets wiped off the face off of our beloved planet.
One profile had this url and I think  urlLink this
site  makes a point more so than anything I can write here. Though it
has free speech, its kind of ignorance cannot be allowed to thrive.
  urlLink Jingoism 
breeds this...
 &nbsp;
 Finally, I can move on with my life...I'm apparently a monkey too but
then again, so are we all who strive for wisdom and knowledge for the monkey
is one of the wisest of creatures and even  urlLink Hanuman 
was favored by the Gods for his wisdom and ability to learn.
 Incidentally, the authorities have been notified. If it had just be
a 'polite' piss off note, I could accept it but the 'DIE NOW!' bit warrants
investigation given this entities history.
 Now, I don't know about y'all but these are the kinds of Bush supporters
I've been running into a lot. I know they all can't be like this! I will
not judge all of this group based on my bad experiences with a few individuals.
People like this are giving Bush supporters a bad name and I'm saying this
as a reminder and heads up to what is being done and said in your name
Bush people.

 A much less disturbing update: The Military is investigating the story
of the Chaplain. I am fervently hoping that this is not true or is blown
out of proportion in some way. Thanks to the Military and free thinking
people who ensure the rights and protections of all our soldiers and citizens!
:o)
 This is a bit more proof that the truth usually comes out with a bit
of thorough investigation. This is the way of rational people.

 INVESTIGATION
  urlLink Pool
dip offered in return for baptism 
 By ROSANNA RUIZ
 Copyright 2003 Houston Chronicle
 A chaplain from Houston assigned to the Army V Corps support unit in
Iraq is now the focus of an Army inquiry for his practice of offering soldiers
a dip into his 500-gallon pool if they agree to be baptized.
 A newspaper article about Josh Llano, 32, generated numerous e-mails
and phone calls, said Lt. Col. Eric Wester, a chaplain and spokesman for
the Chaplain Corps based in Virginia.
 Wester said the article, and the response, got the immediate attention
of the corps' chief, Maj. Gen. Gaylord T. Gunhus, who has requested that
top chaplain officials looked into whether the article was accurate.
 "The chief was immediately concerned about the nature of this article
and negative reflection that it casts," Wester said. "The question then
arose to what degree is the information in the article accurate. The content
of the article clearly raises immediate questions."
 One question is how did the chaplain get access to 500 gallons of water,
which Wester said was "unusually large" for a baptismal pool.
 Also, the article indicated that a water shortage kept the soldiers
from bathing for weeks. Wester said he was not sure whether the unit Llano
is assigned to indeed lacks water.
 He said the unit is supposed to be a support unit whose mission is to
resupply troops. Wester also noted that chaplains do not typically receive
their own supply of water.
 Wester would not say what punishment, if any, could be taken if Llano
indeed did do what the article described. He said the chief wants more
information before any action is taken.
 He said Gunhus' response can be read two ways.
 "It's good in the sense that it shows his commitment to the standards
we have about free exercise of religion," Wester said. "It's bad because
it's bringing very negative public perception on Army chaplaincy."
 Monday's Miami Herald article described how Llano required the soldiers
to first listen to an 1 1/2-hour sermon in his dirt-floor tent. The actual
baptism took an hour as Llano read from the Bible.
 Llano, who described himself in the article as a Southern Baptist evangelist,
was quoted as saying: "You have to be aggressive to help people find themselves
in God."
 Wester said, "As I've read the article and discussed with other chaplains,
the implication of the story is this was a kind of situation of coercion
or bribery."
 The story generated outrage online -- one person who posted a message
on one Web site described the article as "disturbing." Another unidentified
person posted a letter addressed to Gunhus that cited the Army's requirement
that chaplains be "sensitive to religious pluralism and be able to provide
for the free exercise of religion."
 "It is my hope and my request that you will take immediate action to
put an end to Chaplain Llano's tactics and remind him of his obligation,"
the e-mail stated.
 Wester said many of the e-mails to Gunhus echoed the same sentiment
and seemed to read like a chain letter. He said chaplains are required
to abide by the First Amendment right of freedom of religion.
 "It's very important and absolutely critical chaplains uphold the highest
standard in terms of respect for not only performing rites and sacraments
of their own faith, but providing for religious needs of all in that area
of operation," Wester said.
 He could not answer how long Llano has served as a chaplain or provide
other details about his background.&nbsp; 
 
  
 
 
In other news, I just got done watching the  urlLink PBS 
program  urlLink Peter and Paul
and the Christian Revolution . My mother seems really shocked by both
the historical things not usually talked about during bible study or the
fact that I, as a Pagan, knew most of the story and was able to explain
it from a political and historical perspective.
 
 
I think I earned a whole new degree of respect
from her though she does still try to convert me on a weekly basis. I'm
trying to be patient with her but it does get annoying to have "Why don't
you come back?" hemming in on all sides. I just smile and keep explaining
that I don't feel that path is a valid one for me. I don't want to proselytize
and short of getting into a philosophical argument, its all I can do.
 
 
Since I've grown in my spirituality though, I've
been more about study and less about dealing with the proof that I am not
the religions people expect me to be. To me, my belief is profound and
deeply touching, often prodding me to reflect on life in general as well
as my own personal growth in a way I've never experienced before. I've
been Pagan since the age of 13, though no one 'really' took me seriously
at the time and have been studying more since that time. At first, I did
everything I could to defend my beliefs against people who would try to
lay claim to my soul or body to their own belief but I gave up trying after
I turned 16 when it came to me that in the end, it was only my belief that
mattered to me. Only I could see through my eyes, no one else. The people
who wanted so desperately, and sometimes violently, to convince me that
their way was better kind of put a mirror up for me to show me the futility
of trying to 'prove' the validity of faith to anyone.
 
 
No matter how much you reason, scream, shout,
discuss, or just plain sigh, the people who are arguing against you will
always be convinced that you're wrong because they 'know' they're right.
You'll always be convinced that you're right for you, though you're willing
to acknowledge that their path may be the right one for them. The only
thing this does is make them try harder to 'change' you over to their side
because they see a niche where there isn't one with which they think that
they can 'bring you back into the fold'.
 
 
I admire the dedication, but think it could be
put to a much better use than annoying the hell out of people IMHO. Go
volunteer your time and use that energy to help others or grow a garden
and give the food to a neighbor who is going without due to hard circumstance.
Meals on Wheels needs a lot of good volunteers for instance, and I'm sure
they would gladly accept someone willing to help out the community.

 
 
Another thing proselytizers could do is learn
the word 'No' when they hear it.
 
 
I've had quite a few experiences where I was forced
to take a pamphlet, literally, when someone slipped it in my bag. I had
experience where someone decided to stick their foot in my door, thinking
I was nice enough not to keep on closing the door. Lucky for them, they
moved their foot in time.
 
 
 
Most people just want to live in peace. Harassment
and fearmongering are not conducive to peaceful interrelations. I just
wish people could understand that.

and for myself I finally got this friggin blog to work the way I want it
to.  
  Even on a day supposedly filled with the joy and
celebration of ones own life, something usually comes in and fucks it up.
I haven't even reached my birthtime of 3:22am yet. Geeze...   
  I ran across  urlLink this
story  on the  urlLink Witches' Voice .
It was on the news page  urlLink Wrens
Nest News . Even  urlLink Wren
Walker , who is a very wise and sagacious person put a disclaimer in
the posting saying that she wasn't sure of the veracity of it.   
  Quite frankly, if its true, I'm pissed.   
  Below is the full text of the article I read in
the Miami Herald. I've deleted the e-mail address of the writer for obvious
spambot collecting reasons.

       urlLink Strange Fruit 
 Lyrics by:  urlLink Abel
Meeropol (Lewis Allan) 
 &nbsp;
 Southern trees bear a strange fruit,
 Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
 Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,
 Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.
 Pastoral scene of the gallant South,
 The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
 Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,
 And the sudden smell of burning flesh!
 Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,
 For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
 For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,
 Here is a strange and bitter crop.
 &nbsp;
 I am putting this song up here because, quite frankly, I see America
and the rest of the world going down this road again. It is incredibly
disheartening to see the country and planet I love being torn apart by
such fear and savagery that the hatred and cold indifference of dehumanization
causes. Everyone, all I can say is look at yourselves. Look at what you're
doing and saying and see the inevitable road you're going down.  Think
about what you're doing please .

      I'm sitting here  urlLink watching
Ted Koppels news coverage of the war  and for the second time this week,
I feel a measure of joy in my heart to know that all of  urlLink journalistic
integrity  has not gone into the toilet as it has with  urlLink Faux
News .
 He's being honest and fair based on the information I know from other
sources and isn't 'hyping it up' with jingosim. I could almost cry at hearing
an objective story on one of the main networks after so long. Ted Koppel
is on my Respect list right along with  urlLink Andy
Rooney .
 Right now he's talking about the day to day. Gods that man is professional!
 All the other press could learn a thing or two from him.
 &nbsp;
 In other stuff, I finally called that entity out for what he seemed.
I told him I was glad these views of his came out before I seriously got
involved with him and that I was glad that this happened before we ever
got to the point of possibly having children. It breaks my heart but I
have to think about my children first.

      I've been talking with a friend of mine over the past few weeks.
At first, I thought he was a sane person and someone to be at least friends
with. This was before a lot of his beliefs and values ran completely counter
to everything that I am. For some reason, he thinks that when he mentions
'Those people' that I am not included in that statement, but I am.
 &nbsp;
 In fact, the more he mentions his hatred or malice towards 'those people'
the more I get a queasy feeling in my stomach just thinking about him.
 &nbsp;
 I  urlLink make no
bones about who and what I am in advance , so that people will not be
shocked when they talk with me. I do this also to give people the free
chance to walk away from me if they don't want anything to do with the
different things that are a part of who I am. If you agree or disagree
with my stance is not important, so long as you do not threaten or imply
violence against me and those like me for being who and what we are.
 &nbsp;
 Why this is so hard for people to understand it beyond me. They come
up with every excuse in the book as to why I'm open. They say I am trying
to get attention or that I'm crying out for care from them, for the 'tender
love of their god'. This couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.
I have a family and many friends who love me and accept me, though they
may not agree with everything I say or am. I have a faith not only in  urlLink that
which is sacred  but in  urlLink humanity
as a whole . I give them that same respect based on their being family
and their being human. What I do not do is say that because they don't
think like me or do something that grates against me, that they "deserve
to get their ass kicked" or had coming to them what they got, should they
be hurt or killed. What I do not do is cheer their deaths or belittle them
because I know and recognize that they're human beings, just like me, and
deserve the same respect I would ask for myself.
 &nbsp;
 Sadly, this person does not see this. He thinks that the whole of the
world must bend to his will and no other. He thinks that everything should
be his way or not at all. He wants people like me locked up, kicked out
of the country, or 'changed' somehow. Mind you, he 'doesn't really mean
me', he's just generalizing 'my kind' in general. *rolls eyes*
 &nbsp;
 When I think of what he says to me, my mind runs back to a  urlLink Melissa
Etheridge  lyric.
 " urlLink Deny all
that you feel and we will bring you home again. "
 &nbsp;
 I'm through denying. I'm through trying to fit in with what others want
me to. I'm through towing what others want me to be or believe based not
on any real sense of well being or justice, but their own brand of sociality.
I wish people would get it that I am not them and have no desire to be.

      Bonjour Everyone,
 
 
Hmm, Define 'Sick'? Why things like Polyamory were in the 'sick list' is
beyond me. I took a few tests on a few websites at the hypertext behest
of friends of mine who are in the same  urlLink Deadjournal 
circle and scored pretty much what I am and have always known myself to
be. Flagrantly Bisexual LOL. To see more on these tests, please surf to
 urlLink Spark ,  urlLink Quizdiva ,
the  urlLink 400-Point Purity
Test , and the  urlLink Ultimate
Purity Test .
 
 
I've also been doing the thing powerhungry people hate. I've been reading
again, specifically about  urlLink GBLT 
in  urlLink Muslim  society. What with
this  urlLink LDR
I sort of have with my guy , I figure I'd better bone up on what atmosphere
I might run into when I visit him. I read  urlLink quite
a few great articles that I found via Google . If you have the time,
please check them out as they're very good reading. It seems that not only
the 'West' is interested in things like  urlLink Polyamory 
and other types of open relationships. Thank the Gods for that. In addition
to reading up on  urlLink Poly ,
 urlLink GBLT ,
and  urlLink Islam , I've started a new
and more open e-mail list on  urlLink Yahoogroups .
It's aimed primarily at those of us who watch  urlLink Star
Trek Enterprise  and think  urlLink Phlox 
and the  urlLink Denobulans 
are totally cool.
 
 
On the music scene, if you don't download and/or buy  urlLink Cheb
Mami ,  urlLink Cheb
Khaled ,  urlLink Yuri
Buenaventura  ( urlLink Salsa
Singer , did a cool duet with ->),  urlLink Faudel ,
 urlLink Cheb Hasni ,
and anything even remotely positively connected to  urlLink Rai
music , I will personally blow hot air out of my mouth. :p These people
and this music are great, please please please please please please check
out their music. Its really good.
 
 
This entry isn't going to be very long today due to my exaustion from talking
on the phone with a very good friend of mine. He is teaching me French,
well trying anyway, and had me in stitches from 2:00am until 4:30am EST.
I'm gonna call him again tonight to continue my lessons or laugh my lungs
out, which ever comes first. :p

      Bonjour Everyone,
 
I've been doing that thing that power-hungry people hate. I've been reading
some, in particular one  urlLink Senator Rick
Santorum (R) PA  and  urlLink his
comments on Homosexuality to the Associated Press .
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At first, I was willing to give him his day and ignore the obvious idiocy
of his statements but after reading this, I just have to speak out. Below
is the text I read as taken from the  urlLink Newsday 
website.
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
  
 
  urlLink Sen.
Santorum's Comments on Homosexuality 
 By  urlLink The Associated Press 
 April 22, 2003, 6:53 PM EDT
 An unedited section of the Associated Press interview, taped April 7,
with Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. Words that couldn't be heard clearly on
the tape are marked (unintelligible).
 AP: If you're saying that liberalism is taking power away from the families,
how is conservatism giving more power to the families?
 SANTORUM: Putting more money in their pocketbook is one. The more money
you take away from families is the less power that family has. And that's
a basic power. The average American family in the 1950s paid (unintelligible)
percent in federal taxes. An average American family now pays about 25
percent.
 The argument is, yes, we need to help other people. But one of the things
we tried to do with welfare, and we're trying to do with other programs
is, we're setting levels of expectation and responsibility, which the left
never wanted to do. They don't want to judge. They say, Oh, you can't judge
people. They should be able to do what they want to do. Well, not if you're
taking my money and giving it to them. But it's this whole idea of moral
equivalency. (unintelligible) My feeling is, well, if it's my money, I
have a right to judge.
 AP: Speaking of liberalism, there was a story in The Washington Post
about six months ago, they'd pulled something off the Web, some article
that you wrote blaming, according to The Washington Post, blaming in part
the Catholic Church scandal on liberalism. Can you explain that?
  urlLink SANTORUM : You have the problem within the church.
Again, it goes back to this moral relativism, which is very accepting of
a variety of different lifestyles. And if you make the case that if you
can do whatever you want to do, as long as it's in the privacy of your
own home, this "right to privacy," then why be surprised that people are
doing things that are deviant within their own home? If you say, there
is no deviant as long as it's private, as long as it's consensual, then
don't be surprised what you get. You're going to get a lot of things that
you're sending signals that as long as you do it privately and consensually,
we don't really care what you do. And that leads to a culture that is not
one that is nurturing and necessarily healthy. I would make the argument
in areas where you have that as an accepted lifestyle, don't be surprised
that you get more of it.
 AP: The right to privacy lifestyle?
 SANTORUM: The right to privacy lifestyle.
 AP: What's the alternative?
  urlLink SANTORUM : In this case, what we're talking about,
basically, is priests who were having sexual relations with post-pubescent
men. We're not talking about priests with 3-year-olds, or 5-year-olds.
We're talking about a basic homosexual relationship. Which, again, according
to the world view sense is a a perfectly fine relationship as long as it's
consensual between people. If you view the world that way, and you say
that's fine, you would assume that you would see more of it.
 AP: Well, what would you do?
 SANTORUM: What would I do with what?
 AP: I mean, how would you remedy? What's the alternative?
 SANTORUM: First off, I don't believe _
 AP: I mean, should we outlaw homosexuality?
  urlLink SANTORUM : I have no problem with homosexuality. I
have a problem with homosexual acts. As I would with acts of other, what
I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships.
And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. I have
nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who's homosexual. If that's
their orientation, then I accept that. And I have no problem with someone
who has other orientations. The question is, do you act upon those orientations?
So it's not the person, it's the person's actions. And you have to separate
the person from their actions.
 AP: OK, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual,
you would argue that they should not have sex?
  urlLink SANTORUM : We have laws in states, like the one at
the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for
a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets
of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have
the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to
bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you
have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine
the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from,
I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist in my opinion in
the United States Constitution, this right that was created, it was created
in Griswold -- Griswold was the contraceptive case -- and abortion. And
now we're just extending it out. And the further you extend it out, the
more you -- this freedom actually intervenes and affects the family. You
say, well, it's my individual freedom. Yes, but it destroys the basic unit
of our society because it condones behavior that's antithetical to strong,
healthy families. Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, where it's
sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional
family.
 Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage
as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one
thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what?
Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of
marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not
to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog,
or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that
you have a dramatic impact on the quality _
 AP: I'm sorry, I didn't think I was going to talk about "man on dog"
with a United States senator, it's sort of freaking me out.
 SANTORUM: And that's sort of where we are in today's world, unfortunately.
The idea is that the state doesn't have rights to limit individuals' wants
and passions. I disagree with that. I think we absolutely have rights because
there are consequences to letting people live out whatever wants or passions
they desire. And we're seeing it in our society.
 AP: Sorry, I just never expected to talk about that when I came over
here to interview you. Would a President Santorum eliminate a right to
privacy -- you don't agree with it?
  urlLink SANTORUM : I've been very clear about that. The right
to privacy is a right that was created in a law that set forth a (ban on)
rights to limit individual passions. And I don't agree with that. So I
would make the argument that with President, or Senator or Congressman
or whoever Santorum, I would put it back to where it is, the democratic
process. If New York doesn't want sodomy laws, if the people of New York
want abortion, fine. I mean, I wouldn't agree with it, but that's their
right. But I don't agree with the Supreme Court coming in.

 &nbsp;
 Now first, I think he is a loony. I think he has a lot of mental problems.
This is my opinion because I can't believe someone is so deluded that they'd
compare such diverse groups to commonly condemn them. Oh wait,  urlLink Jerry
Falwell ...no comment....
   1. What in the living hell is wrong with you?! Those
things that hurt people abused their power as priests to take advantage
of people! Are you smoking crack?!  urlLink Donte
Stokes  has/had the right idea in my opinion. I personally believe in
a rule of law and would prefer not to go to his extremes but when some
jackass like you says something like that, it really makes me rethink my
position!
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
   2. What goes on between consenting adults IS none of
your business! If you try to pass legislation to restrict  urlLink GBLT ,
Poly, or anything going on between consenting adults which is not harmful
or illegal by a reasonable, non-bigoted standard, I will personally recommend
setting a video camera with a live feed at every place you go during the
day just to keep an eye on what you do and have it broadcast on all the
crappy network channels in place of that reality TV. Then if you should
break any of these laws you seem to want to impose on GBLT and Polys, we
could come and arrest you by your own damn bullshit standards. How's that
for 'Right to Privacy'? Would you be in agreement to this?
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
   3. If we get banned then so do you. I say ban heterosexual
acts just to be fair. People like you want to hold up these impossible
standards because you feel you're morally superior but I've met far more
moral people among open communities like GBLT and Poly than I've ever met
around your ilk. You won't let  urlLink GBLT 
and Polys get married by law like a lot of us want to yet you want to hold
everyone to your standards. Has it ever occurred to you that we're not
you? Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, we have dreams
and ambitions for  urlLink families 
of our own yet people like you step between us and this goal every time
you try to ban Gay marriage or further ban Polys from associating with
each other? How the hell are we supposed to fit your lofty standards when
you won't let us?
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
   4. Actually, if you had bothered to do your research,
you'd find that the  urlLink monogamous 
structured family is not the normal mode of 'Every society in history',
but just the ones you choose to align your values with. Most societies
were of an  urlLink Adulterous 
or  urlLink Polygamous 
nature, either  urlLink Polygynous 
or  urlLink Polyandrous .
Now if you really want to keep with tradition, you'd give up  urlLink monogamy .
Even in so-called  urlLink monogamous 
societies, how many people cheat on their spouses? How many divorce their
spouses in the  urlLink serial
monogamy  pattern? Has it ever occurred to you that possibly people
were getting  urlLink married 
for the wrong reasons in the first place? What is right for you is not
necessarily right for me or the next person.
 I personally believe that consenting adults have the right to judge
for themselves what is good for them and would not persecute you for being
monogamous though you persecute me and mine for being  urlLink Polyamorous ,
and  urlLink GBLT .
 &nbsp;
 By the way, there are several societies that had no problem with  urlLink Homosexuality .
Maybe you need another trip to the library? Maybe even a good long talk
with an  urlLink anthropologist  or two?
 &nbsp;
   5. Why would Congress feel the need to create the 'Defense
of Marriage' act if there is so much protection for people. If everything
truly is fair, why is the definition there except to keep you and yours
happy at the expense of others. Sounds suspiciously like another case I
recall reading from 1967. The local government wanted to break their  urlLink marriage 
up and didn't consider their union valid, even though they loved each other,
just because the people in their local government didn't feel they should
be together. Those same limiting people felt that this couple were a 'moral
affront' to the sensibilities of the Union and against the natural laws
of man and their god. I am so glad the couple  urlLink won
their case .
 &nbsp;
 &nbsp;
 In closing, we live in a free society where people are entitled to their
opinions. They're also entitled to challenge opinions where they feel that
they're mistaken, deluded, or just plain wrong. This I believe strongly.

  urlLink Search For Abandoned Girl's Family Goes Nationwide 
 POSTED: 8:09 am EDT May 19, 2004
 UPDATED: 6:03 pm EDT May 19, 2004
 BALTIMORE -- People in Maryland and in New York have seen the pictures
of a little Brooklyn girl who was abandoned in Baltimore nearly 10 days
ago. However, social services officials said they are no closer to finding
her family.
 
   

Courtney, 3, (pictured)cried because she was tired of the lights, the cameras and all the questions. But officials at the Department of Social Services are hoping all the media coverage will help them find Courtney's family.
 

DSS officials said a man claiming to be her father left her with a stranger
more than a 10 days ago and never came back. Video footage has aired in
Maryland and New York and more than a half dozen people in the Baltimore
area called in with information.
 "A few calls from people who say they think they saw a little girl and
a man in Laurel," said Sue Fitzsimmons from the Maryland Department of
Social Services. "I had a call from a woman who thought she'd seen the
family about two years ago in Reisterstown."
 "We did have some people calling us to make sure we knew there's a Brooklyn
in Maryland and we know that, but she's clearly from New York," Fitzsimmons
said.
 &nbsp;
 But there were no calls from Brooklyn, N.Y., where the 3-year-old says
she's from.
 "I'm a little concerned we haven't had any calls from Brooklyn," said
Fitzsimmons. "I mean I was hoping someone would call and say, 'Yeah I know
them. They lived up the street from me.'"
 DSS is moving toward a nationwide search.
 "I think that's important this child could be from anyplace," said Fitzsimmons.
 As for Courtney, DSS officials said don't mind all the tears. She's
OK. She smiles sometimes when she's happy and sometimes she remembers mommy's
not around.
 "I think this child has touched so many people that they really want
to know who she is," said Fitzsimmons. "They want to help us in any way."
 If you have any information about Courtney, call the Department of Social
Services by dialing (410) 361-2235.

      Bonjour Everyone,
 At least something good is going on lately, eh? Congrats to all the happy couples!
 
  
 
  urlLink First gay couples wed in US state 
 &nbsp;
 In the coming days, hundreds of couples are set to follow the example
of Marcia Kadish and Tanya McCloskey of Malden, who have been together
for 18 years.
 There were jubilant scenes in the city of Cambridge, which began issuing
licences to gay and lesbian couples from midnight (0400 GMT).
 The issue has divided opinion and politicians across the US.
 On Friday, the US Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch attempt by conservative
groups to stop same-sex marriages from becoming legal in the state.
 In Cambridge, gay and lesbian couples queued for marriage licences outside
the city hall - which opened as the law came into force.
 Newly-wed Tanya McCloskey said: "It was really important to us to just
be married... Part of it is, we don't know what the Legislature is going
to do."
 She and partner Marcia Kadish worked at breakneck pace to fill out paperwork,
get a waiver from the usual three-day waiting period, then return to city
hall - where they got their marriage licence and exchanged vows.
 Political divisions
 Other towns and cities across the state were also prepared to wed large
numbers of same-sex couples as the law came into force.
 Some US cities have controversially allowed gay marriages
 The Supreme Court ruling upheld a decision by the state's highest court.
 It said that denying marriage licences to same-sex couples violated
anti-discrimination laws.
 The Massachusetts ruling has fuelled heated debate across the country
- and the controversy has been particularly intense in an election year.
 President George W Bush has called for an amendment to the US Constitution
that would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
 His rival John Kerry - who is a Massachusetts senator - is also opposed
to same-sex marriages, but favours a more limited form of legal recognition.
 Thousands of same-sex couples were married in San Francisco earlier
this year, but the marriages were not recognized by the state of California.
 A mayor in New York state is being prosecuted after performing gay marriages
in February.&nbsp; 
 
  

 &nbsp;
 May they have joy in their lives and no trouble from the zealots..

 urlLink  Hard lessons from poetry class: Speech is free unless it's critical 
 
 By BILL HILL
 Last update: 15 May 2004
 Bill Nevins, a New Mexico high school teacher and personal friend, was
fired last year and classes in poetry and the poetry club at Rio Rancho
High School were permanently terminated. It had nothing to do with obscenity,
but it had everything to do with extremist politics.
 The "Slam Team" was a group of teenage poets who asked Nevins to serve
as faculty adviser to their club. The teens, mostly shy youngsters, were
taught to read their poetry aloud and before audiences. Rio Rancho High
School gave the Slam Team access to the school's closed-circuit television
once a week and the poets thrived.
 In March 2003, a teenage girl named Courtney presented one of her poems
before an audience at Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore in Albuquerque, then
read the poem live on the school's closed-circuit television channel.
 A school military liaison and the high school principal accused the
girl of being "un-American" because she criticized the war in Iraq and
the Bush administration's failure to give substance to its "No child left
behind" education policy.
 The girl's mother, also a teacher, was ordered by the principal to destroy
the child's poetry. The mother refused and may lose her job.
 Bill Nevins was suspended for not censoring the poetry of his students.
Remember, there is no obscenity to be found in any of the poetry. He was
later fired by the principal.
 After firing Nevins and terminating the teaching and reading of poetry
in the school, the principal and the military liaison read a poem of their
own as they raised the flag outside the school. When the principal had
the flag at full staff, he applauded the action he'd taken in concert with
the military liaison.
 Then to all students and faculty who did not share his political opinions,
the principal shouted: "Shut your faces." What a wonderful lesson he gave
those 3,000 students at the largest public high school in New Mexico. In
his mind, only certain opinions are to be allowed.
 But more was to come. Posters done by art students were ordered torn
down, even though none was termed obscene. Some were satirical, implicating
a national policy that had led us into war. Art teachers who refused to
rip down the posters on display in their classrooms were not given contracts
to return to the school in this current school year.
 The message is plain. Critical thinking, questioning of public policies
and freedom of speech are not to be allowed to anyone who does not share
the thinking of the school principal.
 The teachers union has been joined in a legal action against the school
by the National Writers Union, headquartered in New York City. NWU's at-large
representative Samantha Clark lives and works in Albuquerque.
 The American Civil Liberties Union has become the legal arm of the lawsuit
pending in federal court.
 Meanwhile, Nevins applied for a teaching post in another school and
was offered the job but he can't go to work until Rio Rancho's principal
sends the new school Nevins' credentials. The principal has refused to
do so, and that adds yet another issue to the lawsuit, which is awaiting
a trial date.
 While students are denied poetry readings, poetry clubs and classes
in poetry, Nevins works elsewhere and writes his own poetry.
 Writers and editors who have spent years translating essays, films,
poems, scientific articles and books by Iranian, North Korean and Sudanese
authors have been warned not to do so by the U.S. Treasury Department under

penalty of fine and imprisonment. Publishers and film producers are not
allowed to edit works authored by writers in those nations. The Bush administration
contends doing so has the effect of trading with the enemy, despite a 1988
law that exempts published materials from sanction under trade rules.
 Robert Bovenschulte, president of the American Chemical Society, is
challenging the rule interpretation by violating it to edit into English
several scientific papers from Iran.
 Are book burnings next?
