      Pom Wonderful.  We know what you're thinking: Wonderful. Yes, that's what we were thinking too. Starting with the way we nurture, handpick, personally squeeze only the best fruit, to the way it is beside the rest of the refrigerated juices and not on the juice aisle, we admit that we are a little smitten with the fruit. But who wouldn't be? It contains the most antioxidant power of any drink, and other than just being really pretty, it tastes really good too. Sweet and tart at the same time, it makes you smile and pucker up at the same time.  It's wonderful, astounding, brilliant, and just downright cool. We would have liked to use all the cool adjectives to describe this juice, but we thought "Wonderful" just summed it up nicely. Pom Perfect could have been better, but perfect just seems a step under the reaction you'll have to this drink.

      To whom it may concern (Bret Johnson):  I feel it my duty as a 7th quarter student to discuss some things that I have witnessed at the Creative Circus. I am a firm believer in this school, and in the quality of the experience that the students receive herein. I would say the quality of the "education", but I have heard from some students that we do not receive an education at the school. This quite disturbs me, seeing as I have assignments, I get grades, I have "teachers," I am called a "student" and I sure as hell believe that I am learning several things that my $3000-plus "tuition" is affording me.  I would greatly appreciate if you could find these students and remove them from our presence as soon as possible. I would feel like a Mobster songbird if I gave you names, so I won't. (Although my phone number is listed in the student directory, and I like to hang out at the Ansley Mall Einstein's Bagel Company between the hours of 2-4 on Thursdays.)  Now that I have helped define my purpose for being at this school, on to more pressing matters. First, I'm sure that you are aware that not every student is walking around with a laptop. That is because we were informed by our admissions representative that we had two computer labs in which we could work during the school hours. That's great, but it is turning out to be a politician's promise, in that several times throughout the week both labs are inaccessible to students due to classes. Now Bret, I am not one to just complain and not offer any solution, oh no. I have used my college education to figure out that there are twelve times that classes can be held during our school week. To my knowledge, there are at least two times during the week when both labs are closed for classes. That is four classes, two of which are taught by our "Tech Guy," who is here every day from about 9-5. Would it not be so difficult to schedule the classes so that one lab is open? If John Q. is teaching classes on the time that a teacher coming in from the real world would prefer to teach, could he not teach his class at a different time during the week to facilitate an open lab. This would be great for students like me that basically twiddle their thumbs if they don't have a lab in which to work.   Second, could you please continue passing out the free copy cards? They are great. I think your ploy to make us like you would be even more successful if you did this throughout the quarter. Although, if you are picking and choosing your weeks to give out these cards, I guess I would rather have them at the end of the quarter than all the way through.  Oh, definitely another subject to talk about is this nasty rumor about letting just any ol' freak off the street into the school as long as they have a check with the correct dollar amount. I know that when I decided to come to this school, I worked my ass off to prepare a proper portfolio to show to the heads of the departments. I even got a manicure and a pedicure so I would look presentable. And I won't even get in to the bikini wax I got on the off chance it came down to sexual favors in order to secure my seat at the table. The point is, I thought it was a challenge not only to graduate from this school, but also to get IN to the school. Was I incorrect in this assumption? I think keeping out the riff-raff from the get go is a good idea. Look at exclusive country clubs around the world. They keep the riff-raff out, and it seems like every member is good at tennis, golf, or some other sport. Or, if they are not, at least they have enough money to make people forget about that fact. Well, that second part may not be as good an example as the first. But you get my meaning, I believe.  On the subject of money, what in God's name makes you hire some of these teachers? Another reason I came to this school was because I was told I was going to be taught by the "best in the biz," not the "best psuedo-freelancers on the block." Not all of them are bad, mind you. But for pete's sake, READ our evaluations. We are the ones sitting in class listening to these people. Don't give them any more money. Go get the really talented people that don't need any more money, offer them money, and yes, if necessary, offer them sexual favors to come teach for us. Trust me, they will like that. So will we.  Finally, this is an "Advertising, Design, and Photography School" is it not? Then stop saying that we teach Illustration, because we do not, and please stop treating the Design kids as the bastard step-children that should be locked in the attic. I should clarify here, because the department itself is not being treated as such, but for the love of God, find us mentors, and help us get jobs. That's why we are here. TO GET JOBS. I don't care if it takes hiring a Carol Vick of the design industry, but one thing that I've learned here is that Carol Vick KNOWS Advertising. I've watched her place many people during my duration. These people have been Art Directors and Copywriters. Design grads? Not so much. Her ultra-sensitive feelers just don't dip into those pies I believe. I may be wrong, of course, because I will only truly know when it comes time for her to place me, but if I only have 4 options for mentors, and I have not heard of positive placements from past design graduates, then I am starting to become concerned that the false advertising extends from the lack of Illustration disciplines into the lack of placement help for designers. We need love too.  I trust that you will listen to these comments with the same deer-in-headlights look and open mind as when I first became friends with you a year ago. Do you remember that night? 5 am in the daylight computer lab? Ellen, Erin and I were so enamored of you then. Please don't let us down now, by making us change that perception of you.  Sincerely,  B. W.

      My favorite quote of all time, from now till the day I die is from "Ball and Chain," as sung by Janis Joplin when she was incredibly fucked up. Funny how that's when she made the most impact.  She's singing along, obviously getting more emotional as the song progresses. She starts straying from Big Mama Thorton's original lyrics:  "And I want someone that could tell me, tell me why Just because I got to want your love Honey, just because I got to need, need, need your love,"  And then she starts to break down:  "I don’t understand, honey, but I wanna chance to try Honey when everybody in the world wants the same damn thing When everybody in the world needs the same lonely thing When I wanna work for your love, daddy. When I wanna try for your love, daddy."  Finally, the musician's stop playing and just let her go: (THIS IS THE BEST PART!)  "I don’t understand how come you’re gone, man. I don’t understand why half the world is still crying, man, when the other half of the world is still crying too, man, I can’t get it together. I mean, if you got a care for one day, man; if I mean, if you, say, say, if you want to care for 365 days, right? You ain’t got it for 365 days, you got it for one day, man. Well I tell you that one day man, better be your life, man. Because, you know, you can say, oh man, you can cry about the other 364, man, but then you’re gonna lose that one day, man, and that’s all you’ve got. you gotta call that love, man. that’s what it is, man. If you got it today you don’t want it tomorrow, man, ’cause you don’t need it. ’Cause as a matter of fact, as we discovered in the train, tomorrow never happens, man. It’s all the same fucking day, man."  She's now said her piece, and starts to sing again, still to no instruments, and off the correct lyrics:   "So you gotta, when you wanna hold a somebody, You gotta hold him like it’s the last minute in your life, baby. You gotta hold, whoa, whoa, hold him ’cause someday some weight’s gonna come on your shoulders, babe, It’s gonna feel too heavy, it’s gonna weigh on you, It’s gonna feel just like a ball, ball, ball, oh daddy, And a chain."  Whew.   Normally, I would just quote "THE BEST PART," but I wanted to set up the stage. I could have gone on and on with that, by talking about her life, but if you're reading this, you may already know all about Janis, and I would just be boring you. If you don't know about her, learn and listen. Her life story is tragically beautiful, and beautifully tragic.  Not that Janis rambles on about it enough, but this quote has touched me from the first time I heard it. I know, you have to look past the drug-induced "mans," "baby's" and repeated words to get to the meat of the quote, but it hits home.  This breakdown that Janis has is basically a response to the shit that the world has thrown on her. A social outcast growing up, she still lived life to the fullest, and had a damn good time doing it. She fully felt all the good and all the bad experiences. I guess that's why it touches me so deeply. I think that's a great way to live, and I think that it's a great way to understand life. People always wonder why things happen, and I think that the quote means that to wonder and question all the big and little things of life is crap. Take life for what it is. Ride the rollercoaster, and try to stay on the ride as long as you can. Refuse  get out of your favorite seat or to make every seat your favorite seat.

      Top ten things things to do to christen a new house:  10. Yeah. You know that one. Its obvious. Every room of the house, blah blah blah.   Now that elephant has been ushered out of the room,  9. Throw a raging party, where you embarrass yourself in some way but still get to pass out in your own bed.  8. Break something of your roommates, but don't tell because that person will just assume it broke in the move.  7. Look in every nook, crevice and cranny four times.  6. Put something big and hideous in the front lawn to introduce yourself to the neighbors.  5. Have a dance-off to bad one hit wonders of the 80's and 90's with your roommates.  4. Invite all of your new neighbors to a housewarming party, then only served spiked punch and pot brownies, then ask them where are all the gifts.  3. Practice Chinese fire drills at random times of the night to acclimate you and your roommates to the house.  2. Watch your roommates change clothes, but pretend you didn't see them. (*DISCLAIMER: Not that I've done this one. Moving on...)  1. Scare the shit out of your roommates after making them sit through a triple feature of Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, and Alien.

      Always for someone else. Never for me. Why is it that this prissy Buckhead Betty, with all the “stressful” components of her life, needs a standing prescription of this magical candy? Is dropping her kids off at school in the 2005 Land Rover, shopping for fabric for the new chaise lounge, catching lunch with the ladies tennis team, wandering aimlessly through the nursery for a new fern, and then stopping at Eatzi’s for the family’s home cooked meal SO difficult? “Be a dear, Suzie, and bring Mommy her Valium.” Yeah, right. That’s the height of stress, let me tell you. I don’t even know how she makes it through the day. One day, after a particularly harrowing day trying to communicate with Javier, the migrant worker assigned to prune the hedges, she felt it utterly necessary to take the last two of her prescription in a single time. Let me tell you the next day was not pretty. She shook me like she was hoping for a hot roll on a $100,000 bet at the Bellagio, hoping that the hollow sound of my emptiness would somehow magically conjure just one more precious pill for her meager happiness. When nothing produced, I was thrown several times around the room, before being snatched up and thrown into the hottest Louis Vuitton satchel for a breakneck drive to the pharmacist, where, lo and behold, I was immediately returned to capacity with the umpteenth refill on the prescription that says “Refill 2 times.”  Did anyone ever think that I might be the one that needs a little mellowing out? It’s hard being depended on all the time. That, my friends, is stress. Always being worried that you may not be able to pull through and produce what is demanded of you? Or like that time that the miniature pinscher, Buttercup, discovered me under the cabinet after I had rolled off the countertop. I thought I was done for. Sweet little Buttercup batted me around the bathroom like I was her own personal play toy. Chomp, shake, gnaw, pounce, and scratch, over and over again. The noise coming from within my cavity drove little Buttercup crazy. So I didn’t feel sorry for her at all when she actually worked my top off, ate all my contents, and slept for 3 days straight. Nope. Wasn’t worried for a second. Served her right. It’s enough to drive me mad. I still have scars, and they’ll never go away. I have to live with that. On top of everything, those teeth and scratch marks make me have a paralyzing fear that I will be replaced one day with one of those new, fancy “easy twist-off top” bottles. Ha!   Through all this, it is nice to always be needed. I know that I will never be forgotten in the back of the cabinet like those poor cough medicines and antibiotics. Poor kids, just stuck back in the dust and dark behind the hottest face-lifting cream, deodorant, and new weight control herbal medicines. Every day, coming closer and closer to their expiration date. They aren’t needed. They aren’t loved. I am. I know that I am like a good friend, always ready to be the small shoulder that makes everything better. I don’t have to do anything but open myself, give a little and then watch like a worried mother as my remedy takes effect and, finally, my dear lady slips off to a peaceful dreamland.

      Competitive eating contests. What is the deal with these things? I don't mean to offend, especially if you live for the day that you are able to eat six pounds of lasagna in an hour, or if you are able to consume twelve pounds of SPAM and still settle down for a triple-thick milkshake. Are you aware that there is an International Federation for this “sport?” Americans wonder why the rest of the world thinks that we are gluttonous and wasteful. Hey, here’s a good clue! The powers that be label this federation “International,” as if suggesting that the whole world is involved in this orgy of food. Ok, so Japan has a sushi-eating contest. They also have TV shows like Most Xtreme Challenge, so they have similar morbid-voyeur obsessions like the USA has with our reality TV. So maybe they can be excused. What other countries are involved in this federation? Canada, specifically British Columbia, and the UK, which incidentally has possibly the worst contest: a multi-food contest of haggis, a three-course meal, and oysters. The first food, haggis, is enough to cry out, “Dear God, Why?” Haggis, if you are not aware, is essentially nearly every part of a sheep stuffed into its stomach, much akin to a bloated sausage. No offense to Scotland, it’s home country, but yuck! I mean, this food came about from families in famine that needed to relieve their land of too many grazers, all the while feeding large families on tight resources. This is not food which to gorge oneself upon.  Back to the issue at hand, lets look at what some “winners” have imbibed for their titles: 5.75 pounds of Tempura Deep Fried Asparagus Spears in 10 minutes. Six pounds of baked beans in, get this, under 2 minutes! The same guy with this record also consumed 7 quarter-pound sticks of unsalted butter in 5 minutes. The list goes on and on. Some foods, like the butter, most sane people would never consider eating alone, let alone mass quantities.   Of course, the IHOCE has a less cynical view of competitive eating. “Competitive eating is among the most diverse, dynamic and demanding sports in history. It dates back to the earliest days of mankind and stands alongside original athletic pursuits such as running, jumping and throwing. If you have 30 hungry Neanderthals in a cave and rabbit walks in, that is a competitive eating situation. Of course, in the last two centuries competitive eating has been practiced with somewhat more formality.” They also cite multiple nations that have embraced the sport, including Germany, Thailand, Russia, and Scotland. There is also a formal circuit, a “season,” if you will, of eating competitions. A professional eater can eat his way through the summer, and the country gorging him/herself on Chicken wings, then matzo balls, followed by pickles, before going to the zenith of the sport, Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest, in Coney Island. In twelve minutes, as many as 50 hotdogs and buns are inhaled by 20 individuals. This incredible number is held by a near-hundred-pound Takeru Kobayashi of Japan. That’s one of the ironies of the sport. Many of the competitors are TINY. This is one of the sports greatest draws. Anyone can do it. But why would anyone really want to?

      What makes an easy product and what makes a hard product? For a designer, I think an easy product comes from being interested in the product. Often we get to make up the product, which can be really hard, but at the same time intensely creative. That's rewarding in itself, but seeing the product take form under our hands and in our heads is worth all of the hard work.   I think all products are hard, because you have to work hard to communicate the intent of the product to the masses. That can be really tricky, and often, you miserably fail. But the times that you work the hardest, the product becomes true to itself and the good stuff then really flows.  Writing this blog is proving to be one of the hardest things that I've ever done creatively. I am one of those people that has 15 journals, but each has the first few pages filled out and then nothing. Same goes for photo album. The first few pages will be full of pictures, but the rest, nada. I have a storage chest full of pictures and albums, but they don't go together. So why am I this way? I guess because I would rather verbally tell the story than write it down. When things go down on paper, I want them to be just so, in a perfect way. I was always rather a nerd in high school and college, because I actually liked writing papers and essays, because I knew I would do them well. But writing about nothing, just to write? Very hard.  So I guess the answer to the question is that a product that I create from scratch or near scratch is hard, but satisfying and easy to accomplish and follow through. Making myself and my mind a product, that is the hardest, as yet with little satisfaction and still very hard to follow through on.

      Ok. So the assignment is to write a self portrait from the perspective of someone on a first date with me. Yeah, that's not gonna happen, simply because I just don't GO on first dates. I am one of those people that just "happen" into relationships. No dates, no wooing, no preplanning, nothing like that. I'm just not that girl. So, as a compromise, here's a perspective of a guy who meets me for the first time and is interested in getting to know me better.  So I'm going out to the bar, planning to hang out with my friends and have a few drinks. Damn, there's this group of loud girls here. Two cute blonds, and a redhead. Loud, fun, and little social butterflies definitely. ME LIKEY. The night progresses, I get to know all three of the girls. The redhead interests me, because she seems at one instant to be a crazy, fly-by-the-seat of her pants girl, but the next instant, she's pulling out the mother card and taking care of all of her friends. Which by the way, she seems to be really good friends with a bunch of guys, which intrigues me in both a naughty way and a cool way. She's very affectionate with everyone, including me, which makes me instantly feel like one of the group. She's also could be considered intimidating, because she is a force with which to be reckoned. She flies around the bar sometimes to jump in on a conversation or to give someone a hug, always bringing a smile to the person's face. She makes everyone laugh, partially because she says insane things, and partially because she will say anything that comes to her mind. She definitely doesn't seem afraid of much.  As the night goes on, I find myself off in a booth with her, sharing things that I've hardly told my best friends. I feel like I can tell her anything, because, for as much as she talks, she is also willing to listen and really understand things that you tell her.  She mentions that she is a chronic best friend, to guys and girls, and I can see where that title comes from. At the same time, I can tell that it leaves her out in the open often, with noone to listen to her needs. And she really is more of a conundrum than I realized at first. She is loud and brash, but sometimes the things she says lead me to believe that her outward personality is just a front. Then in the next instant, I am sure that it is not. When you hear the term, "leaves your head spinning," you know that it comes from girls like her. At first, I really thought her friends were the cute ones, and that she was just the fun one. But the longer I hang with her, the more I realize that she is cute in her own way. She seems to be quite confident with her looks, much more so than other girls, but at the same time, not. But man, she's an animated doll. The faces she makes can be as cute as anything, or as disarming. Just depends.  The bar's closing, and I want to get to know this girl more, but here she just gets giddier and I can't tell if she wants me to get her number, take her home, or leave her the hell alone. Maybe if I had bought her a couple more drinks, I'd be able to tell, but as the night ends, she again changes her persona and gets kind of shy and demure. This girls a conundrum, a walking contradiction, and I can only hope that I'll see her again.
