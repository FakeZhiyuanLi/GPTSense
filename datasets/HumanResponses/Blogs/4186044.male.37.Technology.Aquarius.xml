      It's not hockey or football season (well, almost) so my TV works  undertime .  Fortunately, I have found a new anime to be addicted to: Samurai 7.  If the name sounds familiar, it's because it is loosely based on the Akira Kurosawa film  Shinchin no samurai  (Seven Samurai), a story of 7 samurai warriors who band together to defend a village against bandits.  The Kurosawa story is set right smack in the middle of feudal Japan. Samurai 7 doesn't mention where or when it is set, but it appears to be "modern / immediate future" in a modernized, albeit feudal Japan.  The series, so far, kicks an enormous amount of ass.  Try taking a look for episodes. If you're stuck, send me an e-mail and I'll help out...   urlLink fnord_523@yahoo.com

      I've read a lot of science fiction.  I mean   a lot of science fiction  .  I'm usually at a loss when someone asks me what my favorite book, series or author is. Typically, I'll answer "Stranger In A Strange Land", "The Foundation / Empire / Robots books", or "Issac Asimov".  I've changed my mind.  As a youngster, I was introduced to Dune. It didn't make an impact on me until David Lynch's "Dune" movie came out in the 80s.  I may be the only person I know who liked the movie (long and short version). It was easy for me to ignore the slight faults of the movie or the outright inventions (wierding modules?!?) and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.  Since the first movie, I have devoured the remaining Frank Herbert Dune books: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Dune Heretics and Chapterhouse Dune.  I've also read the new books from Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson: House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, The Butlerian Jihad and The Machine Crusade.  These new books have increased my respect for the series a thousand fold.  Now, if anyone asks me who my favorite author and series is I don't hesitate.  Frank Herbert and  Dune.   I urge those of you who haven't read any of the Dune books to go grab them. Now.  And enjoy!

      I have now sunk to the lowest possible level. I have a blog.     I knew I'd get around to it sooner or later, but it seems that it is the  ultimate  expression of nerdom.  I will be using this spot to be as direct and possibly offensive as possible on whatever happens to piss me off at a particular time.  I may even choose to highlight the rare things that  don't  piss me off as well.     Or not.  Thanks for stopping by!

      My name is Wayne, and I am a sports addict.  Sadly, the Olympics hasn't done a really good job of hooking me in this year.  In fact, I haven't really given a damn about the Olympics since they decided to let professional athletes compete.  Professional athletes get enough television time as it is. I don't want to Serena Williams or Allen Iverson or Brett Hull representing Team USA -- I want the unheralded amateur athletes given perhaps their one and only shot to be in the limelight.  I know Allen Iverson is a great basketball player. But what about the kid who goes to a small Division III college and has managed to escape the glance of NBA scouts? Doesn't he deserve the opportunity to shine?  Brett Hull is the 3rd leading scorer in NHL history. If I want to watch him blast pucks in to the net, I'll watch a Coyotes game. I don't need to watch him at the Winter Olympics. I'd be more interested in watching the kid from Nowhere, South Dakota who plays on the pond and at his small college.  I still watch the events that aren't filled with pros (swimming, mostly) but I can't get into watching the Dream Team play basketball or the NHL All Star team (err...Team USA and Canada) play hockey in the Winter Olympics.  Myabe it's just me, but I think the Olympics needs to be changed back into the World Games where athletic skill, not name brand recognition, is the order of the day.

      "Oh Lord, please protect us from your followers."    -- Anonymous  I had a close encounter with a fundamentalist the other day, and it wasn't pleasant.  I went to a store that I visit for one reason only -- they sell Coke products for a buck a two liter. I drink a hell of a lot of Diet Coke, and they are my dealers.  I brought four two liters to the counter and proceeded to wait in line while the cashier was discussing Jesus with a "customer" (who hadn't purchased a damn thing) in line.  I am typically very tolerant of other people's religious beliefs, provided that they are not "witnessing" or "preaching" at me.  After several minutes of standing at the counter holding an armload of soda I said "Look people, Jesus isn't paying for this soda -- I am. Would you please move him out of the way so I can pay for my soda and get out of here?"  The cashier was not pleased with this and told me to "get the hell out of his store".  I proceeded to enumerate a few points.  1 - "It's not your store, you are a schmuck getting paid minimum wage to run a cash register."  2 - "Leave church for Sundays, not for work"  3 - "The job of a cashier is to help customers, not holding services in a check out line"  He wasn't happy with me at all after that. Actually, he looked like he wanted to slug me. I did the obvious thing of course, I egged him on.  "Okay, Jesus boy, you want to do something about it?"  He got the message that he was walking on thin water and got out of my face. I left the store and will never go back. Ever.  Fortunately, it's only Family Dollar, so there's no sorrow there. That store sells nothing but  shit  anyway.   It's worth my while to pay a few cents more and not have to listen to preaching outside of church.

      I have been a registered Libertarian for almost twenty years and have faithfully supported Libertarian candidates and their platform.  Until now.  Mind you, I have no intention of changing my party affiliation, nor do I have a problem with the Libertarian party candidates or platform.  It's merely because I believe that the greatest danger facing the country today is George W. Bush.  W is the most inept moron to steer the helm of this country. Ever.  Today we have a president who ignores terrorism to fight a "revenge" war, a president who can't even properly speak the English language, and a president who has no desire to seek the consensus of the United Nations.  I think Dave Letterman was right on the money when he said "George W. Bush - the president Dan Quayle we never had."   I urge everyone to go out and vote. Don't let the RNC or the Supreme Court decide this election. Please.  No more years!

      But not for a lack of trying.  Charley was the first real hurricane that I've experienced. I have a little more respect for them than before.  I live in Winter Springs (Central Florida). My apartment complex got hammered. The first entrance is still blocked by an oak tree and there are branches of every type and size littering the entire complex.  The power went out Friday night at 9:30 pm but forunately was back on by Saturday night (in time for the Saturday Iron Chef showing).  Fortunately, none of my friends or family are any worse for the wear, even though there are still power issues throughout Central Florida.   My parents live in Longwood (a few miles from me) and I opted to spend the hurricane there (because, as you know, misery loves company). I wasn't very comfortable, so when the power came back on at 3:30 Saturday morning, I opted to drive home.  That was the scariest road trip ever. I live all of 3 miles away and it's the longest 3 miles I've ever driven. Trees in the roadway, signs all over the place, shredded canopies, you name it.  It sucked. Hopefully that will be the last Central Florida hurricane for another 40 years.  But don't count on it.
