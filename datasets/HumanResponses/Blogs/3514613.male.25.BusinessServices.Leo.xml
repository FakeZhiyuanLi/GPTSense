      It definitely is one of the cutest among its breed. It comes in a variety of hues & tones and has prefixes as diverse as BABY and DUSTY. Your face turns this when you blush. A series of movies were made with its name. We even have a pop star being its namesake. But most dreadful of all is when it’s used with reference to a slip. Yes, Ladies and gentlemen we are talking about the color PINK and the one term that takes away all the sheen associated with it –  ‘THE PINK SLIP’ .  For most of us regulars, the term in general came into notoriety with a slew of Yankees complaining, crying, agitating, threatening and what not; as they bitterly spoke about being pink-slipped, to facilitate the out sourcing of jobs to all the third world  ‘Cyber Coolies’ , who had very happily agreed to do their job for a lot lesser price. Though we had enough reasons to cheer at the thought of getting to bite into a rather large chunk of the American Pie; little did we realize that the influx of the American life also brought with it all aspects of their work culture and processes.....   And then as more Indian companies tried to pursue the western managerial practices,  ‘getting shown the door’  become an everyday affair, without sparing even those places where the thought of a layoff had earlier brought with it scares of  ‘Trade Union trouble‘  and  ‘Strikes’ . I bet Jack Welch would never have dreamt that his  "Vitality Curve"  preaching the 20:70:10 ratio would eventually earn this religious a following.  For those yet to be introduced to the harsh reality of a vitality curve; the managers at GE had to promote the top 20% of their people each year, they got to keep 70%, but they had to terminate the bottom 10%. This exercise was to be followed every year.  However this policy had certain negative aspects; for instance, even if a manager finds that all employees in his department have performed above par, he had to still follow the 20:70:10 ratio so that 10 per cent of the total staff can be asked to quit. Else it reflected as the manager’s inability to carry various tasks – decision making, detailed analysis, separation of personal opinion from professional, to just name a few..... I’m sure this aspect of the vitality curve has been debated and discussed enough by people of superior authority. But to add my bit to it, the fact that certain decisions are taken based on the relative performance of an individual and not his absolute contribution, shows total insensitivity towards the employee.  But since we are not talking about GE or its policy and to avoid the digression that more often than not happens with my posts; let me get back to what we started with – ‘the pink slip’. Whether we call it ‘discharge’, ‘dismissal’, ‘layoff’ or the more ingenious ‘the sack’, ‘the axe’, ‘the boot’ - The art of ‘forcibly dismissing a person from rendering his services to the company’ has definitely evolved over the ages. How else could we explain the need to have at least two dozen well known phrases meaning the same thing? What we know for sure though, is that no known company has ever handed anybody an actual pink slip; then why pray have yet another name for something that can be told in loads of other forms.  To soften the blow I guess.....  Why not???  After all Pink definitely gives the soothing appeal to this mean act.....   So how do we know if we are also a part of the dreaded list that would eventually find its way to the HR team? Let me confess; though I have never been done in yet, I have kept my senses open enough, to know a few indicators. Sample some–   Method 1:  Read between your boss’ lines. Regardless of what he eventually says, your boss definitely gets to know things a lot before you would. Beware of these statements from your boss-   1) Boss:  Hey Sharath, did you know that ABC corp. is starting their new centre in Richmond road - I think you definitely need to give it a try – your profile would suit their requirement pretty well ( Boss means:  that’s because your profile no longer matches the requirement here).   2) Boss:  Sharath, I think you need to take a break for a few days– I would like to see how well your team does in your absence ( Boss means:  I would definitely like to see how much of value addition you create - if your team can still continue to deliver in your absence, then you are worth zilch).     3) Boss:  Though you are due for an appraisal this week, I think I will defer it for another month or two ( Boss means:  that way I can save a lot of my effort and time – why an appraisal when you are already on your way out).   4) Boss:  Sharath, didn’t you tell me last week that you were planning to buy a car. I guess you should put it off till the next month. This month is not very auspicious ( Boss means:  why car when you would just be sitting all day at home – serves you right anyways, planning to buy a car when I still have a stupid bike).   Method 2:  People digging past graves. It is a certain fact that there never is enough reason to give you the sack, based just on your immediate performance. And that’s when your history is dug. So beware if people start asking you to submit all files of your previous accounts or question you about your performances over the last year or two. It's a definite indicator of the beginning of your end.....   Method 3:  Search for signs of animosity from your superiors. Nobody wants to be associated with a loser. So when all the senior personnel in your office suddenly starts distancing from you; be assured that it is a clear indicator of them knowing that you are on your way out and that they no longer want to have any personal ties with you.    Method 4:  Befriend the HR guys. Though they have appeared absolutely avoidable right from day one (think HR and the first thing that you remember, is the thousands of forms that they made you fill-up, on the pretext of 'joining formalities'), it definitely is a wise ploy to have friends among their breed. Firstly, they can help you with complete information of movement (in & out) across all levels. Then they could let you know of openings in other departments, which you should grab to avoid the urgent crisis at hand. And most importantly, they often know of immediate requirements in other companies and could push your name through their fellow beings at that place.  These are just a few but powerful indicators to let you know when you are breathing your last. So if you get any such indicators, you better know that you are due to recieve the final handshake (and it's certainly not golden). Next time, I will probably write on ways to ensure you never become a part of this dreaded list in the first place; but till then just follow my word and hope you never have a  red lettered day  at office- after all red is certainly quite close to Pink.....

       Lakshya! The Word is Lakshya.... Though it’s been quite a while since promos of this movie has been doing the rounds; a series of inevitable events that occurred at work over the past couple of days, has made me look away from the ‘ Bird Nest’  hairdo on ‘ Pretty’  Preity’s face and reflect a lot more seriously on what Lady Zinta keeps unrelentingly blabbering on the marquee. Yes, Ladies & Gentlemen it’s time for Goal setting or as Roshan Junior is explained in the movie, it’s time to have our ‘L’ word in place.     As the new boss opened the weekly review meeting with a rather poker-faced query on the tasks given for the team to do over the week, it didn’t require any stupendous memory skills to recollect the requisite, but then considering the pin-drop silence prevailing in the room and of course my innate ability to dig graves for personal use; “You asked us to set quarterly targets and goals”, I blurt out with some assistance from an equally able colleague. At the moment if somebody had said that Foot and(in) Mouth was not found in India, I would advocate nothing less than Capital Punishment to that moron.    The meeting nevertheless progressed (with a stern warning of course – on the dire consequences of a repeat act), onto a lot more things that deserved instant priority; what needed my immediate attention though, was this 4 letter word called  Goal  ( definitely with a capital G ); I certainly ended up slogging my brain for the rest of the day and night in trying to understand what would be the goals and targets of the vast billions that adore this blessed planet.   It’s a definite truth that no man (or Woman) is absolutely aimless in life. We all know what we need in life. Yes the fact remains that sometimes we don’t know how to get there. Sometimes we might not know how much we want. Some other times we might not even want anything substantial enough. But unarguably we would all want to have a good life (the degree of ‘good’ depends on the ambition levels), with enough goodies to boast of a sound personal wealth. And yes most importantly as the age old adage goes, we all want to be  Healthy, Wealthy and Wise .     But with most corporate Honchos talking in lengths only about setting aggressive and measurable targets, I’m just a tad bothered by the fact that we are all getting a bit too deeply absorbed into the ever ominous rat race. Though I’m neither qualified nor experienced enough to philosophize the basic requisite of a corporate life – which is to compete and do it fiercely – the fact that these ever ambitious goals take away a decent part of the quality of an individual’s life is certainly an insight worth remembering. I’m sure there are enough Devil’s Advocates claiming that this is what distinctly marks the Gates, Dells and even our own Ambanis, apart from the rest of Gods lesser children. But then how in heavens name can we explain the fact that these are the very guys who ensure that they lead a life of the highest quality while their Super-Managers break their heads setting targets (and passing it onto their Subordinates) and more importantly trying to achieve them.   Trust me; I have nothing against these Business tycoons. In fact I idolize them and admire their sheer courage in going all out to build their vast empire (sometimes definitely on others graves) – But the fact still remains that these are the only set of people who are ensured achievement of all their personal goals and targets in life just because some of their managers are breaking their backs at achieving them. So what happens is a simple case of a large mass of Individuals ensuring all personal targets of their bosses are met, while they go all out meeting their professional targets. It is not very difficult to realize who ends up being   Healthy, Wealthy and Wise  .  Now don’t consider me to be one having a communist ideology. In fact I’m very much pro-capitalism and ‘am seriously contemplating into getting onto an entrepreneurial venture sometime very soon. And considering that the whole world is looking towards us as the home of the services industry, services is definitely what I would provide. Yes people I have decided to become a  Super Cool Goal Setter .....   Aimless Drifter (AD):  Hello sir, my wife always says that I have no goals in life. Can you please help?  Super Cool Goal Setter (SCGS):  Of course Aimless Drifter. That’s why I’m here. But first let me ask you a question. What do you want in life?  AD:  Well, not much – just to live life the way it comes.  SCGS:  No, No.. That’s going without setting a direction. Think of something you want to end up with.  AD:  Well I think that I would want to end up pretty well off with a good family.  SCGS:  Wrong again. There is nothing Tangible in it. Think of something that can be measured.  AD:  OK, how about 10 Lakh rupees with a wife and a couple of kids.  SCGS:  No your targets are way too low. Increase it by a couple of folds and also change the rupees to US Dollars.  AD:  Why more wives and more certainly why dollars. I thought anything foreign was not allowed.  SCGS:  You will be termed a loser if your targets are low. And unless you start thinking in US Dollars, nobody will care about what you are. Moreover foreign is allowed as long as it is not the  Italian Lira .  AD:  So can I make it 5 million Dollars with 5 wives and 10 kids.  SCGS:  Perfect.   AD:  Thank you Sir, My wife would definitely be very happy now that I have Goals in life.  SCGS:  Yes of course. All you have to do now is divide it into yearly, quarterly and monthly targets and you will be on your way. And yes before you go my fees are 5% of your goals....   Just imagine the killing I could make in the form of fees charged for my exceptional counsel. With the definite assumption that there would be nothing less than a few hundred million Aimless Drifters in this world, I would not only be able to set outstanding Goals for myself but also achieve it with immense ease. All I have to now worry about is to get hold of a good way to advertise myself far and wide and ensure my services are heard about even in the remotest corner of Timbuktu. Any advises.....Ensure it is passed on to me.....A free counsel guaranteed for accepted suggestions.    As I licked my lips in anticipation of the immense wealth I would earn, I just couldn’t help shout   GOOOOOOOAAAAAAL  . Only this time it was a cheer for Wayne Rooney’s excellent kick past Croatian goal keeper Butina, as England romped home into the Quarters.... At least somebody had met with their immediate Goals....

      Hurray!!! It’s finally done. My first piece of written work and in a couple of minutes (assuming I finish this piece in the first place) it would get posted onto  RÊVES INFINIS . Now why my blog is named the way it has been, is quite a story in itself and considering that I hope (beyond my wildest expectations) to keep writing and fill my blog with unparallel idiocy, it’s quite certain that this story also can be told one day. Now coming back to the tale at hand; the intent earlier was to name this piece ‘Why did I finally start Blogging’, but repeated attempts to get myself onto typing a few words of self presumed wisdom brought about one absolute self discovery; the fact that I have never tried doing a ‘thing’, just because a lot others were doing it. Sound confusing? No, No, let me clarify…. when we try looking at it closely, it’s not all that confusing; what it rather turns out to be is a simple case of utter stupidity!   From time immemorial (which in my case has to be 1978 or a couple of years later when I started making sense of things), I have always distanced myself as far a possible from the most popular (read fashionable) of the worldly pleasures our earthly kinfolks have invented. Without delving deeply into what happened years ago, let me list out a recent few……  The whole world went Potter crazy; The adventures of the extremely lovable witches & wizards with the amazingly dim-witted muggles became an international hit catapulting poor little Mrs. Rowling from a one bedroom studio apartment into a Scottish castle and a new husband in tow. But for good old yours truly, Harry potter was just a fad, something to indulge in for those who had absolutely nothing else to do. The fact that every single Enid Blyton in sight was gobbled up as a kid, was something that was conveniently forgotten. And then when somebody did ask the question – “How did you find the Order of the Phoenix”? The reply was quite instant – “Harry Potter…… Who me??? Noooo Waaaay”. Though I never had to explain the reason for such an answer (probably my good friend never cared about the reason), my answer quite certainly sent the message that I was not to be considered one in the same pedestal as all those million poor souls who missed a beat in their heart on learning how Mrs. & Mr. Potter were brutally killed by Lord Voldemort.   A few years earlier; everybody I knew spent all their time (and almost all their pocket money) at a place with a very droll name ‘Cyber Café’. Now only heavens know why it was so mandatory to serve tasteless coffee when hundreds of college going teenagers paid through their nose(and waited with folded hands) as websites with crudely morphed pictures of some very popular actresses (and actors) came alive on the screens of Pentium machines, in closed cubicles of these cafés. It was also quite fashionable to own a free e-mail account (mostly hotmail), as it certainly added a few points in the ‘status quotient’ of an individual. And then one dear chum dared ask the question – “Hey dude what’s your e-mail id”? The reply did not require me to bat an eyelid – “Internet… Who me???? Noooo Waaaay”. Though my dear friend probably just wanted to send me a mail with a greeting message and questions on how I was doing (how very convenient!!!, considering we stayed in the adjacent rooms at the campus hostel), my answer certainly sent the message that I was not someone who would waste time at a stuffy 3’ X 3’ cubicle helping some industrious businessman mint money.  The list could continue; Playing Computer Games…., Internet Chatting….., Watching WWF (as a kid)…….; However considering that I have already wasted quite a lot of our time and a tiny bit of space on blogspot’s server, let me leap into the latest of my adversary. Already having a cult following the world over, Blogging has certainly become a huge data source by itself. From writings on anything, everything, anybody and everybody to absolute useless personal stories (yes, yes I know this is one of them), blogsites are filled with information we could all want. The fact that it is written mostly by ordinary people definitely gives it an added personal touch. Then why do I hate Blogging? I guess it’s just because blogging has suddenly become outrageously popular. A lot of people I know started blogging (and more irritatingly talking in lengths about how much fun they were having writing their minds out) and this suddenly put me onto the “Noooo Waaaay” mode.   Then what is it that has made this amazingly coooool anti-popularity icon (well I guess that’s what I think I’m) fall prey to something that’s becoming a rage with any and every head that spends a decent amount of time on the internet?????   Trust me; I have not the faintest idea myself. That’s exactly why I had to change the title of my first ever post on a blog site. Well don’t blame me if you have been let down by the ending after being forced to expect a wonderful story on self realization and the need to change into a more intelligent being, all through these ramblings. Could it be that I have suddenly become a lot more mature, not worried about being a silly trend follower or has the world suddenly become a lot better for a normal completely sane individual like me.   Well I guess;  With all those time spent playing computer games & chatting…….  Realizing how paranoid I get if my mail box is not checked every 15 minutes…..  Frantically waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out (that too after lapping each one of the first five word by word)…….  I must have finally learnt to say the following 2 words, when asked if I was against a popular fad – “Nooooooo Waaaaaay”

      It was the most amazing Thursday Poovathurkaddavil Baby Philips’ had experienced in his forty years of life, at his hilly home town in north-east Kerala. The fact that the RSS – UDF clash in the nearby town of Kannur had left 40 dead did nothing to diminish the bliss. He had just become a proud father and though his ever dutiful wife had borne him 3 other children, this one was certainly different – it was a girl this time. Finding a name for the child took lesser time than lighting a candle at the chapel. With the first three children being named Vincent, Vinton and Vindy, it was a foregone conclusion that the next one would be named Vinny. Though the preferred sex of the arriving one was definitely girl, having a name like Vinny would have helped anyways, even if God had decided to postpone a girl till the next time. The fact that children found their names not the least bit preposterous was more due to the fact that their mates at school had more ridiculous names. In school there already were three siblings Biju, Miju and Siju. There was even a pair of opposite-sex twins who were named Lijo and Liji just because their parents were Lily and Joseph. The Baby family was certainly quite known around the town. With Mr. Baby philip being a government servant employed in the office of the District Agricultural Officer, he hardly had to step out of his house. The number of Bandhs, Hartals and Leaves always summed upto over 300 days. His occasional visit to office was more to bring home the farming goods that were unnecarrily stocked at his office. Hence he had the time and resource to turn the few acres of his inherited family estate into a haven of pepper and coffee.  His brother had his own business going in the Gulf (it was widely believed that he had the largest chain of Tea Shops in Jeddah alone) and had managed to smuggle in quite a few Akai products. Like all rich men Baby Philip was quite well known and this made life for the family quite comfortable.  Vinny Baby grew as the darling of the house. Most of the days were spent playing Hopscotch with friends. Watching her brothers climb coconut trees and designing colorful Lungis for her dad were among the favorite past times. She loved school but hardly manage to attend any. Schools never opened during monsoons for fear of the thatched roof collapsing and then there were always enough reasons for teachers to close shop on those rare occassions when it did not rain. However Vinny did spend a sizeable part of her childhood in Sunday Schools. The family being orthodox syrian catholics; church formed a major part of her Sunday life and the rest of the day was spent feasting over various marine and land animals deep fried in coconut oil and garnished with grated coconut.   Venkatapuru Appa Reddy also was born on a Thursday but in the sunny plateaus of Krishna district.  His parents welcomed their bundle of joy by offering eleven full grown sheep to their family deity, even as the kid’s maternal uncles had just chopped off the hands of four of their rival caste men. It had certainly taken quite a while for them to have their first kid and knowing that he could be the only one, they decided quite instantly to shower all they had on this little one. The little one however grew quite fast and before they knew was already turning out to be a plumpy pampered pest. Naming the child had certainly taken some deliberation, not just among the different members of the maternal and paternal family but also among their favorite astrologers. A good two years went this way and the name Appa was finally decided probably due to the fact that this was the first word the kid had blurted out. Appa grew up on continuous learning of naxal killings and feudal war fares. This was supplemented with loads of parental love (in the form of the finest ghee and butter) being part of his daily quota of truckloads of rice, sambar and the hottest of mango pickles. He also was a very fast learner. By the age of nine he could recite all of Chiranjeevi’s dialogues by heart. He also knew the complete vital statistics of every single heroine in the Telegu film industry. He very soon learnt to single handedly take care of the family’s large Ganja farm. Climbing down the house’ well (in the walls of which all the cash was stashed away) and brewing home made hooch was among his favorite hobbies. By the age of 13 he also knew that his rich cousin’s new born girl was to be his future wife. Though studies was the last thing in his mind Appa was very smart and had soon realized that his movie heroes got to use automatic self loading weapons to kill their city based villains but had to make do with sickles and knives in the villages. Soon he set his sight on moving out of his tiny hamlet to Hyderabad not just to have a better living but to experience the pleasure of killing people with guns as he had been sick of chopping people with swords.   Vinny Baby grew to become a fine young lady. The gallons of Coconut oil that went into her hair everyday gave her long tresses that accentuated her looks. Her brothers on the other hand also had done decently well for themselves. One held the state record for the fastest coconut tree climbing championship. The other was doing a thesis on making country bombs at home. And the third was already renowned as the fastest growing tea shop magnate in Sharjah. Though as a kid Vinny wanted to be the next PT Usha or Shiny Wilson, she soon realized that like all good Christian Malayalees she had to serve mankind by becoming a nurse. The fact that some of her friends did not join her in her endeavor was quite disappointing though. They preferred to marry the most eligible of the gulf based bachelors around, have children with them and serve the husband’s family while their husbands worked in the oil fields of the sheikhs. Moving the apple of their eye to a nursing school in Mysore was the last thing in her parents mind.  But with his wife giving indicators that she would love to send Vinny to a missionary to serve the good lord, Baby Philip instantly decided that being a nurse in faraway Canada was definitely a better bet than being a nun at a seminary nearby. Life in the fast lane could not have been more trying for poor Vinny. College life was absolutely atrocious. When boys called her babes, she could never tell if they were calling her by name or making a pass. They also constantly mocked at her funny way of speaking English. But then she offered them some Banana Chips and all of them became her best friends. The years passed quickly and Vinny soon passed out as an excellent nurse. The only unhappiness was when she could not go to the US and had to settle in a super specialty hospital in Chandigarh.  Appa Reddy got admission into a well renowned Medical college in Hyderabad. Though he neither had the aptitude to do medicine nor the marks to get through the entrance exams, his childhood passion for the city life forced his parents to get him admitted after paying huge donations. His rather rich cousin had decided to completely sponsor his education. After all his daughter was growing pretty fast and the prospects of having a doctor son-in-law was obviously worth more than a few lakhs. The first lesson Appa learnt in the city was that he had the most gauche name in the entire world. If it wasn’t for the lessons on Indian culture that he learnt at school, he had even contemplated suing his parents for giving him this tacky a name. He even realized that unlike movies people in Hyderabad never got to shoot people with guns and hence was forced to continue using knives, this time however at the operating table. Appa loved college and spent more time in class than any of his other colleagues. Infact he ended up spending a full 4 years more at college than his first class mate. While at college he also got to know that his teenaged niece who was to be his future wife was chopped to death by her own father as she had dared to fall in love with a tribal. He did not care to find about the tribal boy’s fate, but was quite pleased to know that the fiancée’s death meant he was single again. In the meanwhile he spent a lot of time learning about medicine and realized it was in the best interest of the people that some other doctor did the healing. So he decided to use a sizeable part of his dad’s wealth to build his own super specialty hospital. And since most of Andhra was already filled with hospitals, he decided to tap the north Indian market. And thus started Reddy’s Super Specialty at Chandigarh.  Chandigarh had suddenly bloomed in mid December. Like straight out of a fairy tale a nurse was marrying the managing director of the hospital. It was love at first sight when Appa had met Vinny. Appa had caught flu and the best nurse of his hospital was summoned to give him a shot of an anti-viral drug. The injection Vinny gave Appa was the sweetest he had ever received in his life and soon love blossomed. After a brief courtship they married. Family opinion was thrashed. Though initially reluctant both families gave way. Baby Philip was only unhappy that she had not married an NRI. Appa’s father had lesser problems. Only he did not know enough of kerala. His only knowledge of God’s own country was that good porn movies were made there and he himself had spoilt his sleep on a few Saturday nights to experience them. Soon there was a new born in the family and like everyone else he too started growing fast. He was naughtier than anyone else though and when angry used to call his dad by his first name. However he always managed to get away with it as everyone though that the kid was only addressing his dad by the south Indian linguistic equivalent of the term ‘Dad’. Naming him almost led to a communal battle and after a lot of consideration he was given the perfect name. It was the ideal example of non-communalism and to give it a dose of national integration the kid was always made to wear a Sikh turban.  Thus was born the turban clad Robert Raj Rahi. More on him some other time......    Epilogue:  Please do not try to see reason in the above story. The purpose was neither to redeem any character nor to bring out a moral from the story. The reason the above piece of writing was posted are a few-  1.   I had received comments on my previous post that I have to stop writing only about corporate politics and look at something different. 2.   A very well renowned fellow blogger Sidin Vadakut, has been turning out to be among my biggest inspiration for writing. The above style of writing has been influenced by his posts. 3.   Though the characters are completely fictitious, some of the names, family details and backgrounds are inspired by some people I have known in life. 4.   Finally and most importantly – I have been writing only for a couple of weeks now and have written not more than 4 posts. I’m sincerely trying to imbibe a style of writing and humor is something that I’m endeavoring to achieve.  Since it’s an ambition to start writing short stories, I decided that I needed a start irrespective of how good or how long the start is. Thus this post was born.  Comments and Critiques on the above story, it’s style and anything else is very much appreciated and would certainly help me do better.......

      Bangalore has been the most amazing place that I have ever known. Some could say that it’s because I have never lived anywhere else. But then most would agree that it’s one Indian city that keeps making news all the time. OK, Delhi makes news too, but then we are talking about news of the right kind. Beginning of as one of the earliest Industrial Hubs it’s today one of the fastest growing cosmopolitan cities. Not to forget the amazing number of personalities who have grown out of Bangalore and become champions in fields as varied as business, culture, sports .... Right from its people to the weather, everything has been kind to me. The one time I have been really scared of Bangalore was during my high school days. Some of us had become great fans of Nostradamus and had decided for sure that the third world war was to happen in 1996. We had even decided that the war was to be fought between Islam and Christianity with India remaining neutral. A movie also claimed that the statue of liberty would be the target of the first missile attack on America. One of my good friend immediately indicated that if Pakistan had a chance to attack India, its first target would be Bangalore. And why not! Bangalore had the most number of prime industries then (read HAL, ITI, MICO). That’s when I decided I had to get out of Bangalore to a place where Pakistan could never reach. Who cared if Pakistan had a missile that would travel the distance to Bangalore or not, what was more important was that Nostradamus had indicated a war and it was bound to happen.  Three incidents over the past couple of weeks have suddenly increased Bangalore’s fame. Firstly the Merriam-Webster Dictionary gave a new meaning to the word.                Bangalored: 1. Outsourced    2. to have your work done by another.     There were even guys walking about in the US wearing T-shirts that read “I have been Bangalored”. It certainly was quite innovative of the guys at ‘Merriam-Webster’ to come up with such a thing. But let’s look at the backlash. Suddenly all Bangaloreans have turned out to be the worst possible lot on earth. All we do is get the poor Yankees ‘Bangalored’ and have fun doing their job. Further, our poor kids have another English word that they need to learn and do horrible things like ‘spelling tests’, ‘dictations’, ‘sentence construction’ and what not. However newsmakers are having a field day going about announcing that we are only the second city in the world to have our name as a part of the English language and that it’s the most prestigious thing that could have happened to all of us living in Bangalore. Being the true bangalorean that I’m; I want to correct these claim makers on two accounts. Firstly, it’s not the first time that Bangalore has been a part of the English language. The term ‘Bangalore Torpedo’ has been in vogue right from the pre-second world war days. Secondly, the only other city that is a part of the dictionary (Shanghai) has a meaning-         Shanghaied:  to put aboard a ship by force often with the help of liquor or a drug.    Anybody claiming that the whole thing is prestigious for Bangalore, needs to be shanghaied and sent to the top of Statue of Liberty during ‘Nostradamus’ Third World war’.  The second Incident that came into light recently was the American Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry’s claim that Bangalore was the best wired city in the world. Infact his statement went like this “If Bangalore in India can be completely wired, so should all of America”. Let’s all forgive the poor man for saying something as absurd as that. The American presidents generally have very little quotients of Intelligence (or anything else for that matter). Mr. George Bush during his run-up to the presidency did not even know who the President of India was, when questioned by the media. And you certainly don’t need to be the smartest person on earth to say with absolute certainty that he still wouldn’t know. A president before him was dumb enough to use his own office for some of his adventures with his secretary while his army was on theirs in far-off Serbia and Montenegro. Mr. Kerry’s statement is certain to have made most Americans decide that Bangalore is the place to be in. They are probably imagining Bangalore to be a completely Wi-Fi zone with the entire population carrying Laptops permentantly connected to the internet. Bangaloreans, for them must be the most hi-fi people with each one carrying a satellite phone enabling constant connectivity. We must probably be carrying out every activity of our day, right from shopping to education through the internet. I bet they think that power and telecommunication failures are unheard of in Bangalore. Little do the poor souls know that clearing the CAT exams and getting into an Engineering college itself takes half a year at good old Bangalore. And talk about an international airport!!! Well talking is all that we have been doing for over ten years now. Anyways let the world live their fantasy and we will live in our reality.  The third news about Bangalore that hit the headlines was the IT bosses’ including Mr. Premji’s announcement that they wished to move their operations out of Bangalore. Now when the announcement talks about moving from Bangalore to places like Kerala and Orissa, it’s time to realize that something is seriously wrong. Mr. Premji’s claims were the following- Bangalore had very high labour costs, very poor technical infrastructure and very little developmental plan. I could never disagree on any of their points.  Only the other day I left office to get back home and realized that if only I had moved the other direction on Hosur Road, I probably would have reached Salem, in the time I took to reach home. The traffic situation in Bangalore is the worst I can think of. Traveling on the roads during evening hours could come only second to watching Saas-Bahu serials in terms of self inflicted torture. As for the high labour costs, the IT moguls themselves are to be blamed for that. They after all started the trend of poaching and offering bizarre salary packages to get hold of quality manpower. Now when they realize that the employees’ demand is getting beyond their reach, they are getting on to the blame game. Nevertheless these public statements made by some of the reputed companies are definitely a cause for concern and we certainly hope that the powers responsible act swiftly to take care of the infrastructure and developmental requirements of these job providers. Else there would occur a time in the near future, when half of Bangaloreans job would be Bangalored.....
