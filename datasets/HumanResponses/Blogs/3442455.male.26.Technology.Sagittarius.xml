      in fact, sex is the single most creative act that one (or two, or however many people) can perform. therefore it is by far my favorite creative endeavor. there is absolutely nothing else that lets me feel as free. sex is the single most creative act in the same way as murder is the single most destructive act. sex and murder both are most vital obviously when they are between two people. there is intimacy implied with sex.  perhaps the opposite of intimacy with murder. i think thats why there is so much stigma associated to sex when it is between two strangers, and murder when it is between two lovers. these statements seem so obvious and simple that i don't really have an explanation for why i haven't ever thought about it before. perhaps because it was so simple that it was easily overlooked. sex and murder are the two ends of the earth. there is nothing more primal and nothing more beautiful. thats why they are the two obsessions of all creative arts. i could continue writing about them indefinitely. i have everything and nothing to say about them. but i will halt here. i just wanted to share my revelation.

      how much i love strawberries do you?  I love freaking strawberries.  Its true.  Chocolate covered ones are the best.  And the regular ones. They are so good with some type of whip cream.  Strawberries and chocolate whip cream sounds about as good as things could possibly get. I just had a strawberry thing from  urlLink veniero's . I actually really like all types of berries.  Blueberries.  Those are good.  Raspberries and Blackberries are delicious.  And holy fucking Boyzenberries are amazing.  I'm feeling so much better today than I have all week at work.  I finally disposed of the annoying techno music.  I am sitting and dreaming and listening to  urlLink dublab , its Morpho right now.  Diet vanilla coke is in the house.  Three day weekend is almost in effect.  I just need to find a way to continue to eat good berries all weekend.  Yes, I need to suck on succulent strawberries for the next several days and listen to some brilliant hip hop shit and I will be living sweet life as poised, aware, and vibrant as I was at age 6. I think thats actually why I like berries so much. They remind me of age 6. I would sneak away from my grandparents house to trek through the woods, skip rocks, pick up raccoon skulls and tortoise shells, get my legs cut up by thorns and eat berries before Id finally arrive at my destination, my dad's little townhouse he shared with several other people.  A woman named betty.  I think it was actually her house. They called her betty and the green door.  She had a green door.  And a shitload of marbles in her attic.  I'd spend the night there on the floor in the living room and laugh riotously way past my bedtime about marmots and dwarves and rice paper houses that never got built.

      This woman on the train today had a cross look on her face and was carrying a file folder with the words "very very personal" on the tab in huge black sharpie letters.  From this I can draw one of two conclusions about this mad dummy in a pink shirt.  Either this woman is being totally ironic, or she is crying out desperately for help.  I daydreamed that I helped her out by snatching the folder out of her hand and violently projected all of the contents throughout the train in to the hands of all the passengers.  She was asking for it.  She feels better now.  I freed her. I'm such a nice guy.

      Defined as "a persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of scratches or being scratched", each year, this surprisingly common phobia causes countless people needless distress.   To add insult to an already distressing condition, most amychophobia therapies take months or years and sometimes even require the patient to be exposed repeatedly to their fear. We believe that not only is this totally necessary, it will often make the condition better.    Known by a number of names Amychophobia, Fear of Scratches, and Fear of Being Scratched being the most common, the problem often significantly impacts the quality of life. It can cause panic attacks and keep people apart from loved ones and business associates. Symptoms typically include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and overall feelings of dread, although everyone experiences amychophobia in their own way and may have different symptoms.    Though a variety of potent drugs are often prescribed for amychophobia, side effects and/or withdrawal symptoms can be severe. Moreover, drugs do not "cure" amychophobia or any other phobia. At best they temporarily suppress the symptoms through chemical interaction.   The good news is that the modern, fast, drug-free processes of The Manic Amyche Clinic will train your mind to feel completely different about scratches or being scratched, eliminating the fear so it never haunts you again.    Consider the true cost of living with Amychophobia.   If you are living with Amychophobia, what is the real cost to your health, your career or school, and to your family life? Avoiding the issue indefinitely would mean resigning yourself to living in fear – missing out on priceless life experiences big and small – living a life that is just a shadow of what it will be when the problem is gone.   For anyone earning a living or at school, the financial toll of this phobia is incalculable. Living with fear means you can never concentrate fully and give your best. Lost opportunities. Poor performance or grades. Promotions that pass you by. Amychophobia will likely cost you tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of your lifetime –– let alone the cost to your health and quality of life. Now Amychophobia can be gone for less than the price of a round-trip airline ticket, or a few weeks of drugs or conventional therapy.   What is the cause of Amychophobia?   Like all fears and phobias, Amychophobia is created by the unconscious mind as a protective mechanism. At some point in your past, there was likely an event linking scratches or being scratched and emotional trauma. Whilst the original catalyst may have been a real-life scare of some kind, the condition can also be triggered by myriad, benign events like movies, TV, or perhaps seeing someone else experience trauma.   But so long as the negative association is powerful enough, the unconscious mind thinks: "Ahh, this whole thing is clearly very dangerous. How do I keep myself from getting in this kind of situation again? I know, I'll attach terrible feelings to scratches or being scratched –– that way I'll steer clear in future and so be safe." Just like that Amychophobia is born. Attaching emotions to situations is one of the primary ways that humans learn. Sometimes we just get the wiring wrong.   The actual phobia manifests itself in different ways. Some sufferers experience it almost all the time, others just in response to direct stimuli. Everyone has their own unique formula for when and how to feel bad.     How do you Solve the Problem of Amychophobia?   We don't actually solve anything. But you do – powerfully. Working with us, you'll rapidly train your unconscious mind to connect positive feelings to the stimuli that used to trigger the Amychophobia. Clients describe the process as 'like magic' – feeling completely different right away – and these deep changes are permanent. Then our practitioners will teach you to regain control of your emotions, so you know how to feel the way you want whenever you want. You'll never notice the feeling starting again, without being able to squash it instantly.   And if you're one of those people who has been playing a mini-disaster movie in their mind... your own "AMYCHOPHOBIA THE MOVIE: The Directors Cut... starring Me!" of all the worst djs you can imagine, you'll find the screen goes blank immediately when you work with us. Your Amychophobia movie will never play again. Now, when would be the best time to have the Amychophobia gone?    We don't use hypnosis for Amychophobia but our modern techniques are equally relaxing and enjoyable. Clients immediately notice that they feel different. Once the unconscious mind feels safe and learns how to respond appropriately, it will always know - so the results are permanent. Amychophobia is gone. Forever.   How Long Does it Take to get rid of Amychophobia? How Much Does it Cost?   The Amychophobia Clinic at The Manic Amyche Clinic™ is entirely results-focused, so we charge you for the result you want: freedom from Amychophobia - regardless of how long it takes.   The process usually requires no more than ten hours. In exceptional cases we can achieve a favorable result in two to three. But because we guarantee the outcome, we will work with you for as long as it takes - five minutes, five hours, five weeks. We work highly effectively by gramaphone. This allows our clients far more flexibility in scheduling listening time, and the results are every bit as good as listening in person.   You'll need to play your part, of course. Usually as part of the work with us there will be some easy and enjoyable scratches for you to do, and that will be a key part of your success.   What's it worth to live free of Amychophobia ?

      I'm pretty sure.  I'm pretty damn sure I got it from my car.  The one with the million tiny shards of glass spread throughout the interior.  Shop-vacs don't really seem to worry too much about details.  They are more interested in getting the bulk of the work done.  I think that if I drive around in the sun my car will be all sparkle sparkle from the inside. I may be blinded if that happens. I may find myself blinded by a gust of wind. I really feel like I am at the mercy of the elements when I am encased in machinery.    hmmm.  I would love to be the machine instead I think.  I want to be just like conky from pee wees playhouse.  I want a record player in my stomach, boom box in my chest, and i want to stutter all my words like prefuse 73 is programming my speach through his mpc.

      sheer fucking boredom. I should probably be doing shit. I SHOULD be doing shit. The only real reason I'm doing this shit instead of other shit is because I'm stuck at work and have no interest in the things I should be doing here, and because I'm here I don't have access or ability to do the things I REALLY should be doing. My car got broken in to again today.  Thats what you get with VA plates in brooklyn.  I want to scream.  I want to record myself screaming with frustration and press it on wax and scratch the fuck out of it. I'll need a distortion pedal and a microphone. I want to scream while I'm scratching myself screaming. I'll actually need two distortion pedals. One for the mic, one for the tables, come on y'all lets rock this...

      The freaking show is over!  I'm still reeling and exhausted and dizzy from the insanity and focus and concentration and energy I've expended over the last few months trying to create a single memorable and fun night for a few hundred people. I'd say it was a great success but I didn't really get to hang out with anybody or watch much of the show myself because I was busy throughout. There is all sorts of follow up that needs to happen and then I might have a couple weeks off, but we will start to work on the 2005 ECNY Awards pretty much right away.  I don't feel much like thinking about it at this point.  I'm pretty damn burnt out.  But next year's show will be amazing.  Promise.  We learned so much and have so many awesome ideas for next year. But seriously right now I just want to work on music.  I want to do that other kind of production.  I want to just focus on getting together a new mixtape to give out to venues so I can get some DJ gigs.  I want to get my band back in gear and fucking record our sick demo so we can shop it around and get some decent shows.  I need to make my time here more self-centered.  More selfish.  I need to be a lot more forceful about what I want for myself. I'm ready to put my stuff out there.  I'm ready to unzip my pants and pull out some sexual soundscapes. I'm ready to rock and shock the nation.  I happen to be so serious.

      I am walking down the street and there are people setting up tables outside with mad boxes on them.  Instinctually, uncontrollably, I lust after these boxes and wish them all to be filled to the brim with cookies.  Chocolate chip cookies are what I want, but not what I imagine is in these boxes.  The boxes are really small too.  Much too small to be girl scout cookies.  They look like they are from last valentine's day. But when I finally pass them they seem to be filled with cell phones or some strange digital communication device.  I keep walking and now my cookie lust has transcended. I now wish that every box, every box that exists was filled with cookies. Whatever cookies I happen to want. Always.

      im really really really not feeling the whole got my tie stuck in my shirt look.  Especially if you complement it with a baseball cap.  However, if you are over 60 and skinny and you happen to be wearing a tucked in white vneck tshirt with red suspenders and a slick sport jacket in 80 degree weather then you are totally awesome in my book.  Today I am wearing my standard black trou with white shirt, sleeves rolled above me elbows, red striped hilfiger tie and black thrift store shoes caked in mud from my cousins wedding.  Oh yeah and I shaved today.

      ronald reagan died.  he was my favorite president.  why you ask?  well its not because i am a conservative.  because i am as liberal as they come.  and its not because i am a republican.  because i am as independent as they come.  and its not because i enjoy his movies.  because i don't.  because i never saw any.    ok then really, why is it?    ronald reagan gave me jelly beans.  thats the answer.  i was a little fat kid and ronald reagan gave me jelly beans. i bet you wonder what the fuck i am talking about.  my grandfather was appointed ambassador to the dominican republic when reagan was entering his second term in office.  because of this my entire family got to go down to the white house and meet and have our pictures taken with ronald reagan in the oval office.  i was 6 years old at the time.  i went right up and shook ronnie's hand and he asked me how old i was and if i liked jelly beans. i told him 6 and yes. then he handed me a big blue box with the presidential seal on it and i opened it and inside was a big glass jar with the presidential seal on it and inside the big glass jar was hundreds of jelly belly jelly beans of all different flavors. now i had thought that jelly beans were pretty tasty when i was that little and i only ate them around easter time.  and i thought that an old guy like ronald reagan was pretty cool if jelly beans were his favorite food. but i never imagined what lay in store for me when i opened that jar, much to the protests of my mother, in the car and proceeded to eat the entire jar full of jelly bellies, the likes of which i had never tasted nor had i ever imagined such heavenly jelly type candies had ever existed. ronald reagan instantly became my favorite president and will remain so into eternity. i know he is eating those jelly bellies in heaven right now.

      Dana Ireland was my next door neighbor and babysitter when I was 4 and 5 years old.  I was totally in love with her. She was my best friend. I've never faced up to the details of her death. I knew they were out there but I never wanted to know what happened until recently. I have so many fond memories and stories about the time I spent with her.  I will share those at some point.  For now let me just state that I still love Dana and think about her and her family often.  Rest in Peace Dana, I miss you very much.   urlLink http://starbulletin.com/1999/06/08/ireland/index.html

      it smells so good and it is so soft that i love it. it is so sweet like chocolate covered strawberry shortcake. that is the sweetest best cake ever. it has a similar effect to mixing ornette coleman with simon and garfunkel. dark sweet mellow beautifully patterned chaos. splashes of red. vibrant sparkling. light laughter throughout. bubbling energy that has an inordinate fullness. insatiable consumption.   the silence between sleeps is divine and sweet in its own. but nothing is better than being in bed. dream states. waking and trailing whispy thoughts. like smoke from a brilliantly burning candle.  blown about by fluttering fans.

      my hair is gone so instead of acting like a normal human being i constantly rub my head like a cat, cleaning myself with my spit soaked paw.  except my paw is not spit soaked.  its just my hand and my nervosity coming together to display mental patient like behavior.  quick! differential diagnosis! i need treatment. stat.   the weirdest thing about having short hair now is the way it sticks out in weird places.  its like my scalp is shifting and reshaping itself over my skull.  and its different on a daily basis.  im afraid the tectonic plates in my head will become maladjusted and i will have a head quake that shakes down all my folicles.  i predict mass destruction and perhaps spontaneous combustion on a cellular and microcosmic level.  im afraid that my head will become so warped that i will have more bumps, twists and and peaks than a himalayan romantic adventure novel.  hehehe, i have a hair on my head for each page.

      hot holy crap. why do i like things so much? like stupid cartoon characters. or ice in my drink. a little sugar in my bowl. i'm going to simplify my life and take advantage of all the things i like and stop depriving myself of them. stop forgetting that i like them so much and take full advantage. im going to just do the good stuff from here on out. forreality. im gonna bus a cap in the ass of sticky fingered lucy who used to jock me for my cheez. im gonna eat some marshmallow with some chocolate with something besides a graham freakking cracker. i will personally hold myself responsible for making all the guacamole i ever eat so that i can avoid cilantro. im going to cull down the things i have and the things i have planned to just like 3 things that make me really happy and that i can continue to do for and extended really stretchy long ass period of time. i like candy, bubble gum and taffy, skip to the sweet shop... i need to own the following dvds in order to maintain a happy and healthy collection. "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" seasons 1 and 2. "Sealab 2021" "Kill Bill Vol1" and vol 2 when it comes out. Also I need a minidisc player/recorder and an air conditioner if I'm going to survive the rest of the summer. These are the things I need and nobody can tell me different and I will fucking get them or somebody will pay, and of course if I do get them then somebody will also pay, and that somebody who will pay will be me, and the thing that will be paid will be money, and it will be in exchange for the aforementioned items.
