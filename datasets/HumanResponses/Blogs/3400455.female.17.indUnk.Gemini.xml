      Haven't seen this thing in a long time. Today I'm in a bad mood, teachers are yelling at me for no reason. oh wait, I talk. but wait, off topic for a minute, Have you ever dreamt you were eating pudding and wake up with a spoone in your ass? Well Bradley has. He told me. Anyways, back to stuff. I slept at Tricia's last night, I had lots of fun. We went to Ben's and Prseque Isle. LoL, got LOTS of stuff. Oh we saw some tirds too, which is hilarious if you knew where. I'll give you a hint, I'm not telling. lol, yeah, I rode shot gun, and we put in in neutral alot. lol I think thats all. I yelled something at her house too, but I do not remember what it was, damn it. Well, I'm bored.. going to search the net. Layter

      Today is Tuesday, and I haven't written in here at all over the long weekend. Must had too much fun eh? Jk, I didn't do a thing, until Sunday. I went to the movies, I saw Shrek 2. It was alright, nothing big, some funny parts. I went with Lacey, Josh, and Ryan. Shelley is sitting beside me and being crazy (she asked if she annoyed me, what do I say? JK SHE DOESN'T). So yeah, oh right I was at the garage sale this weekend too. We made like $300 which is pretty good for out first fundraiser. Lots of people showed up (not from our class), but from all over. It was a good turn out, and we were happy with what we got. But weren't happy when we had two van loads of left over junk to take home. But I guess thats what you get when you sign up for this. Anyways, I'm out until after school..

      Friday is here!! YAY, I'm happy, Today at school it was awesome, we did no work at all this morning, well okay First period, and in Chem but I mean we worked on like 3 or 4 titration questions.. not alot, and then english I did nothing, and in Math we played guys against girls soccer.. We had a good team there was Tricia, Cara, Marjorie, Emily and me. We all play on the soccer team. And For the guys there was Eric, Ryan, Chris Shaw, Gordon, and Adam. We lost, but with me in net we had some good saves! After school Chris drove us to Emily's. We picked up the Garage sale stuff and went back to the Arena. We set up and got a lot more stuff then we thought we'd get. We got loaded! I think we'll make a pretty good amount of money. Before me and My parents left I talked my dad into giving me the truck, I was hungry so I drove to Carl's.. but no I didn't drive by myself. Cara and Tricia came with me. We had some fun. We got stared down though, so I rolled down the windows and blasted the music. Then guess what! I came home.. and now I'm doing this, oh wait no actually, I was in my room saw my brush and MY NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK! and I came out here. Thats all, and now I'm going to go call my boyfriend, I miss him..

      So, this is what its like to share my life with the CRaZy "creeps" of the World Wide Web. hmm.. really not what I thought it would be, but I'll get used to it.  School today, was diffren't.. there was hardly anyone there, Outdoor Pursuits and Leadership went on a camping trip, The grade nines went to the RVCC for some Party thing, and a few of my friends didn't show up.. Chemistry went by fast, Accounting I didn't pay attention and just tried to learn how to make a 69 sex bracelet, Business I worked for about 20 minutes and just sat there for the other 50.. Lunch was alright, signed some yearbooks, signed our Support your 2005 grad class sign, and bummed money for Chelsea so she can drink tonite at the Pub. Math I had a test, and I GUARANTEE you I failed, didn't know a thing that was on there, I knew it last week, but the last few days I've just been talking and of course signing yearbooks. English I was going to work, but then Mr. Grant got me and Desiree to go do some stuff for the Anti-Racism rally our school is having next Friday, so I put posters up and sat in his office. The way home, well thats where things got Interesting... In English Savanna, while I was away, decided to make some signs, and on these signs were just some of the crazy sayings we have, or well Stole, and there were two, but on Mine I had two sayings. Meaghan was on the bus like always because we always sit with each other and Savanna sat across from us. I ripped my sign in half so all three of us had one to show. The whole way home we were showing people these signs, and they probably thought we were stupid, and you all will too.. but I don't really care. Our signs said "Why can't we be friends?"-Savanna's, "I like Eggs" - Mine, and "Harry Bladder" -Meaghan's. To all of you out there that means nothing at all to you, but its just an inside thing. Yeah, I cried on the bus too. Not because I was sad tho, becasue I was laughing so hard, okay I said "Loomie" but you wouldn't get that either. So I came home, bugged my parents to take me to Ryan's Rugby game, went to get Pizza, and came home and did this.. That was my day so far, and its only 6:00.. But I guess I better get studying for my Business test.. Wouldn't wanna fail on purpose.

      Its been so long since I've written. But not a whole lot has happened. Yesterday was Shawn and Mikes Birthday, Today was Adam and Scotts, and Tomorrow is mine! I'm not very excited tho, I'm more excited for HARRY POTTER AND THE POA to come out, and Thats Friday. People must think I'm a geek, but I don't care! They can lick my ass. Harry Potter Rocks!  I found out today that I have an exam Friday, which is great, it leaves hardly any time to study, but thank god the teacher made it an open book, I find that class extremely boring, But the people in it make the class worth going to. (Right now I'm listening to Red Wine- Bob Marley, it makes me be in a good mood. I don't know why tho).  But right now I have nothing more to say, So I guess that means I'm Out.
