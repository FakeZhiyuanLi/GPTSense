      Well, my happiest childhood memory has got to be baking muffins and biscuits in my little E-Z Make oven at my grandma's house.  Now, I was only 5 at the time so I was like, "Gwandmaw, can I make some biscuits pwease?"  And she'd be like, "Yeah sure William Alexander Teat!"  So she'd make some dough and I'd play with it, put a little extra flour in it cause I liked the taste of flour, and "would shoot em in da' pan".  After they were done, I'd eat them.  "Wow gwandmaw, I did vewy good dis time wight?" I would say.  "Yes William ALexander Teat, you did".  I loved making those biscuits - they were so good!  Even the dough was good!  Everything was good!  I love my childhood, I love you, also.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      The Room Suddenly Became Quiet when Mr. Harmless said, "He hates Jesus".   It all start that day when we left to go to the fall retreat.  We left at about 8:00 am or however early (too early actually).  I was excited to go cause I wanted to see all of my friends from the preceding year.  Well the retreat was going great, we had lunch, chapels, gametimes, freetimes and all sorts of stuff.  The day grew old, and there were gnats everywhere.  Oh man, I hated those gnats.  They were like really small little brothers, who kept trying to get closer and closer and closer to you until you just smacked them or something, then they'd always come back.  Gnats are like demerits, they're everywhere and they don't really serve a purpose.  (Just kidding by the way) Anyway, the gnat thing is another story, back to the silenced room.     It was time for the "Bonfire" inside of the building.  Mr. Harmless was giving a testimony when he told us about this witnessing oppurtunity the Lord placed in his life.  By the way, I loved all the testimonies, it's a great time as a school to grow closer.  Anyway, he's a funny guy right? So, he told us that this guy didn't have a single tooth in his whole head.  Everyone started to laugh, then right as soon as we started to laugh, he  said that the man hates Jesus Christ.  The room was silent except for a laugh by Christopher Thomas.  It was a good silence though, because it showed that we were concerned about the man.  How cold and unrevealed he was to the truth about Christ.  But the testimony went on and that was the most important thing.  That's about it, there's been other silencing times, but I couldn't think of one.  Love ya Anderson. Ms. Wiebe, that's (320 Words).  Oh yeah. That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      I don't have one.  Thank you Just kidding - my imaginary friend has many great qualities.  Even though I can't always see him, I know he's there watching me.  He has blondish brown hair, greenish-blue eyes, and a very hairy dad.  I love it when he does the robot, and we celebrate goals together.  We always pass before the games, and he got mad at me one time because I didn't talk to him after Miranatha.  I had to apologize to his mom and hug his dad. I was sad.  Anyway, now we're good friends, even though sometimes we don't get along.  I can never really think of one time where we didn't get along, but If I do I'll put it on here.  All of this stuff is a great friend huh?  Well guess what, this person is Adam Johnson!  Love ya Anderson.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      My Greatest Fear, huh? Hmm, well I would have to say that first of all I have a ton of fears!  I always sleep with my light on, but I don't really fear the dark, I just always sleep with my light on.  Plus I hate it when those hairy spiders bite you, they look nasty and well, I don't like anything hairy and nasty crawling on me.  Those are about the only ones I can think of right now - but trust me, there are way more. I Never feared a lot of things like heights, fire, or storms and stuff like that.  So, what exactly is my GREATEST FEAR?  My greatest fear would definitely getting to the judgment seat of Christ and not being written in the book of life!  I know that isn't going to happen, but it would be horrific if it were.  I had a dream about that one time, actually.  Anyway, fears are not always bad for you!  There is definitely I good side of fear.  If I didn't fear not being written in the book of life - I Wouldn't be written in it - cause I just wouldn't care!  For real, if I weren't afraid of those nasty spiders, I'd probably have some contagious disease with bumps all over my face.  That would be bad.  So, use your fears for good, and if necessary you can always conquer them by facing them.  Alrighty then, that's the end of this journal! And....  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      Ah Yes, the little things! What more can I say about them?  They're little.  Simple meaningless parts of life that don't ever matter do they?  YEAH RIGHT!  I love the little things.  Everything in and of itself is a little thing.  Anything I do with my friends is a little thing - but I love it, and would never trade it for anything, not even a big thing.  I would like to mention just 10 of my favorite little things: - Calling a friend of mine every night ; ) - Playing soccer with Amberto, Hector (myself), Rodriguez, Sanchez, Moses, Victor X, Chiquita, y Maria who play Friday, and we'll beat Martinsville. - Getting an F on my Physics test - Trying to get a job for Saturday at the Purdue game but they didn't want me : ( - My cat dying - Nothing else really, I live a boring life. Cause it's the little things that make you happy, and without them my life would definately be like a college course class on greek - BORING.    That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      Ah yes, the importance of family in society!  I love it!  That is a most brilliant title I've ever come up with.  Now to talk about it, the importance of it.  Hmmm, well I love my family and it's important to me.  I'm also in society and it's also pretty important.  Putting these two together won't be too hard.  I'll sum it up in about one or two sentences.  If people would depend on their family more in society and have better relationships with them, than I'm sure alot of different, bad things wouldn't happen.  More time with family means more care and love for those who need it.  Our society isn't always "nice" ya know?  Like I think of the Japenese people, and they have a tremendous reliance on family.  They're always really nice to everyone!  They share there proverbs, their rice, even give their daughters to marry someone before they're born!  Wow, we need more importance on family in our society.  Thanks yous  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      Anger must be the energy that has not yet found its right channel. Wow, how true is this?  So many other energys are on their right channel.  All the energy like electricity, and light, they seem to be doing good.  But how often have I let my God-given anger, control me.  It definately has not found its right channel.  Anger is used for taking whatever it is you feel like doing, out on the other person.  Anger results in just about anything these days than something positive.  Killing, hurting, slandering, putting down, dividing, and many others are the effects of this energy at its worse.  Anger should be used for solving the problem, SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  Usually it just creates more problems, not even close to solving them.  I can learn from this quote by using my anger next time, to get the problem resolved, and glorifying God in the process!  Jesus did it, so can we.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      There's alot of characterisitcs that are included in a hero.  When someone, does something courageous, or extraordinary that you would never do, or just being a great example of how to live life the way we're suppose to.  With all that said, my heros are my parents and sister (sorry Squeeb, you don't do much except say WEEEEE).  My dad has always been the most unselfish person I know, and he does it in a way in which he doesn't tell me - just the way he acts.  I know so many different things he does different to make his family better.  My mom is always using the Bible - ever since that counselor thing is goin' on.  She shows me when i'm wrong - how i'm wrong - and what I need to do to change it.  And my sister, wow, so many times she's encouraged me, I love her so much.  Most nights, my favorite thing to do was to walk in to her room at like 12 or something, while she's doing her devotions, and talk to her about anything and everything.  She was the coolest, who always tried to make time for me, well except when she went and did things too cool for me, : ).  But the list doesn't stop there, there are so many more people who are my heros.   Jabolini, Jabolini Africa  That's how we do things 'round herrrrre.

      If I was a cartoon? Or if I were a cartoon? I'm not that good at english, but i am in this group where we don't have to do homework, but that's beside the point.  I would definately be batman or something cool like that.  Man he kicks some major joker..... He fights all the dudes, and he's got cat girl for a sidekick, can't get much better than that.  Batman rocks the house until it falls down, he wears this black cape thing, and I am so jealous - Let's get Yogurt!    That's how we do things round herrrrre.

      My Sister, I miss my sister, she's away from here, I hope I get to see her sometime this year; Her name is Rachel, and her last name is Teat, She's really buff, but she has small feet; She plays volleyball and was ok at basketball, It turns out she'd rather just shop at the mall : ); But that's ok she can shop till she drops, I went with her one time and i about flopped; "rachel, i didn't know you were so fast" "c'mon wilbo, you don't want to be last" Ok, fine I ran around the place, I look of excitement on my sister's face; I knew my sister loved shopping, She has never shown a sign of stopping; Right now she talk to me on the internet, This weekend I'll talk to her in person, better yet! See you soon, Rach!  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.

      My Holiday in January, Well I'll start off with letting you know that every single HOLIDAY is a NOSCHOOLDAY as well.  So my holiday, of course, wouldn't have school.  It'd be a Tuesday so you wouldn't have to have homework 2 days in a row.  (sorry people who read my blog but this extra credit stuff is for extra credit, not entertainment).  The name of the Holiday is Celebrate your Date DAY!?!?!  Yeah, you'd go on a date.  That would be nice, except a whole day devoted to a date would kinda' get lame.  So you'd celebrate you date by going to skate and then open the gate to find another girl named Kate.  You're girlfriend gets mad, kate gets mad, the holiday is ruined, and this is the end of my blog. The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Well about a couple of days ago, I started to read this new book called - The Purpose Driven Life.  After reading the first two chapters I can honestly say this will definately be a life changer.  I encourage you to get the book, ha, and I haven't even finished it yet.  Thank God for a sunday school class who makes me buy these kind of things too, ya know.  Also, with Smite, we have to fill out the journal for each chapter.  After it is all said and done, I can look back at the progress I've made.  The very first sentence in the book is - It's not about you.  How true that was to me, I needed to hear that really bad! Let me know you're thoughts on my tagboard, let me know what you think of the book.  Thanks  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Ok guys, this is going to sound really stupid.  But look at the Title of the blog entry, it's kinda' hard to make this kind of thing exciting. BUY THE FLAG  Buy purchasing this american flag located at the top of every teachers white board, you will certainly recieve more than you are paying for!  At a measely 5 dollars, how could you pass this sort of thing up.  But wait, buy now and you'll not get just 1 american flag to go on your whiteboard, you will also recieve 2!  A total value of 10 dollars, all yours for just the price of 5.  Show your patriotism with this beautiful display of american history.  Red, White, and blue matches all sorts of colorful, uh, white boards.  You get the picture, white goes with white.  Do what so many other teachers and ordinary people are doing now and call the number today.  1-800-BUY-FLAG Our flag is our American way of life, make it yours! Must be 18 years of age or older to order.  Cihldren, ask your parents before calling.  So that's it, sorry for wasting your time :) (but you read it) The Bongos will BonGO all night long....

      I'll tell you what happened,    Like the event that happened, not the name of it, but if you know anything about me/my school you'll understand.  Day was January 6, and I was so pumped, getting a chance to do something like this!  I thought it'd be great, the sweetest time of my life.  So as the game began, the nerves were kinda' getting to me, and I could hardly dribble properly, the floor was hard to get used to but that was no excuse for my play.  And I'm not talking about my play only, our team was horrible, they know that, I know that, but we just have to live with it now.  Despite an embarrassment at halftime with ourselves and our coach, we still kept playing like Kindergardners play tag, if that made any sense to you. (running around without a purpose is what i'm trying to say).  The final wistle sound, I CAN STILL HEAR it.  The thought of defeat, especailly to this team (I won't mention the reasons) was just unbearable.  It was sad guys!  I tell you, it's right up there to the defeat of Heritage Hall when I played for JV 3 years ago.  That's how bad it was.    Even when he kissed her, he was lookin' over starin at her sister (what a jerk huh?) .... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Well, I just deleted the whole last Blog I wrote!  Shows how smart I am : ) Anyway, this last week was great I loved Mo G (Morris Gleiser).  If I was ever to become a preacher/pastor I would be sure to speak like he does.  Almost the perfect, balance of humor with message.  I got so many things from the messages this week.  The fact that the prodical son's brother was worse than he was is probably the first time i've heard that.  In many ways of my life I was letting little sins that didn't in fact seem real to me continue.  They were minimized in my thought, and the Holy Spirit helped me to see that.  To show how much complaining I had been doing,  I caught myself (complaining) 5 times the rest of that actual day!  Spiritual Emphasis week is great guys!  There should be at least 3 of these each year.  It was a great time to come together as a school (which I love so much), and become closer to Christ.  I truly mean that.

Basically the guys needed toilet paper but they bought (alchoholic beverages :) ) instead, lol, when it gets check at the register the lady asks, 'paper or plastic' of course the boys reply in pain - PAPER! hahaha.   i'm gonna' have to go with paper also, you can use it for book covers, and it doesn't tear as easily as plastic.  remember this is for extra credit so, you'll have to bear with it again. c-ya The Bongos will BonGO all night long....

      Everyone,    I have the best sister in the world.  This might sound stupid coming from me, but I love my sister so much.  She came all the way from Cedarville (a good 3 1/2 hour drive or more) to see me play my last home game this weekend.  It was a huge suprise, I didn't even see her until I got done w/part of warm-ups.  She rocks, and she knows it.   She laughs at all my dumb jokes, and always takes my side w/the parental feuds.  I love you, rach.  Keep it real, I'm Will

      Well lots of funny things happen. I mean, especially on the way to places.  I remember going to a state tournament game with my trusted friend Adam.  Something that I did because I couldn't help it cause Adam to throw something cause he couldn't help it.  It resulted in diminished playing time for both of us; but the memories were still there.  I can't specify what was exactly involved, just me and adam didn't start for like 2 minutes, and then he put us in, haha!  It was sworth it let me tell you.  I miss you, Clinton.  Matematicas...

      My Favorite Experience While on Break   Well probably my favorite experience will have to be the whole FMT tour, but probably not the traveling or singing!  It was watching "Manichan" with Diablo Dos.  This really kinda' weird dude has us at his house for the couple days we were in New York.  We watched some Christian Music Videos, lol, Really, and then we watched this really disturbing OLD OLD movie about a guy who falls in love with a manichan!  Kinda' retarded and all, but I will never forget that movie!  There was this one guy named "HOLLYWOOD!" he was pretty feminine, and snapped his fingers alot, he kinda' reminded me of... well you fill in the blanks!  Later Players!

      Ah yes the FMT tour,   Wow where do I begin.  It was so much fun/work/fun!  Really, i've never had so much fun serving God and being served by God's people also.  The two things I really learned on the trip was that God works through people everywhere (I already knew that, It was just really emphasized, so..) and the second thing was that I'm so thankful for our school!  Some of those kids there were really really jerks!  I mean horrible!  It was like they were bitter to us.  Out of the 7 different school, almost all 7 were pretty rude.  Our school rocks...  Of course, you're always thankful for the nerds at the schools cause they're the ones that come up and talk to us.    There were a few of those at each school - so everyone who reads this - be nice to guests!  It really helps. I mean, you don't have to always reach out to everyone especially in the Christian Lee case.   It's really good to be home!    The Bongos will BonGO all night long....

      As most of you know,   FCS got a baseball team this year, whoohoo!  I've played baseball all my life, ALL MY LIFE! It's definately probably my favorite sport.  God was so gracious to bless us with a team and a place to practice.  Being a professional baseball player has always been one of my dream professions.  TO get up every morning and play a sport, plus make G's of G's.  What a life huh? Of course only if God wanted me to.  I'm definately thinking about playing college ball, there's still alot to learn.  It's always been a passion of mine, my dad really pushed me to love baseball and I'm glad he did.  My little brother isn't quite the same as me but that's pointless information that you don't need to know.  Later Players The Bongos will BonGO all night long....

      That's the title for today's or should I say this week's blog.  What am I putting off? That's a good question.  Ms. Barbic, I'm not sure if she means like a spiritual thing or like something physical like.... uh ... weight.  I'm not putting off weight anymore so, that's taken care of.  I guess I'm putting off laziness, my grades have suffered this year and it's all thanks to laziness.  I know that I procrastinate alot, but sometimes I procrastinate to take care of my procrastination!?! Isn't that hard to believe!  Sometimes with all this business the best thing I can do sometimes is to sit down and watch tv.  At least, that's what I do alot when I am just being lazy.  I know that this is something I need to work on and am.  Thanks homies.  This girl walked up to me the other day and was like uhhhhh, and I was like WHATEVER! Then this other girl walked up to me and was like uhhh, then I like yeah whatever! The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      What is exactly in a name?   I'm really not sure why Ms. Barbic had the guts to put this blog entry up.  I know that my name - William - means protector.  I also know that Emmanuel means God with Us.  So, I guess that's in a name.  I guess names exemplify who you are.  I mean, Muhammed Ali wouldn't be Muhammed Ali if he kept his name Cassius Clay, he'd just be Cassius Clay.  There's also nicknames, like mine is Wilbo, and Jon Ananias's is Gumbee, and Larry Wayne Jones is Chipper.  I love nicknames - it's all in the name, baby.  If you have a nickname - please sign my comment list and tell me what it is.  Later Players.  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Consistency,    My soul problem ever since the beginning!  I mean I know what I have to do, and I want to do it, but I just dont' always do it!  You guys know what I'm talking about it - Alot has to do with my motives, and alot has to do with my stupidity.  I've been learning myself alot about consistency, if that made sense!  I'm sure you all know about the events happening in my life lately, ALOT! I've learned alot too and I'm thankful for all that.  I've just learned, now is time to get serious about this thing that doesn't really exist until you're a junior called life!  And guys, we are actually not as mature spiritually as the girls, that's sad, and I'm probably the worst one!  Juniors, I hope we all know that we aren't doing the greatest job that we can at being leaders, and I'm a true believer in that, let's help each other, isn't it about time we look to our futures, look to what God has in store for our lives instead of our little fun time during school.  That's what I've learned.  I'm not pointing fingers, or trying to preach, but if we want to have a great year, we need to get a hold of this!  I love my class so much, you all rock.    Help ourselves out - Wilbo

      Should I make a list?   I don't know, maybe i'll just do it in paragraph form.  Well obviously I want to be married - or maybe not so obviously... Anyway, also I want to at least have started a family with my wife of course... Have a stable job that keeps a steady income..  Be routed in a local church, keep in touch with my sister, and stay away from the in-laws.  There's a whole lot of little things that goes on in all of those things I just mentioned, you can figure them out for yourself!  The Bongos will BonGO all night long....

      I had an old box, Strong as an ox, Dumb as a box of rocks, Muslims wear smocks....1 2 3 4 Let me bust a rhyme about a box name Weisel, His V12 truck's engine only ran on Diesel Grew up in a little town outside of St. Louis, Some little rock told him that he could do it; Now he's busting rhymes like no other, Gave alot of his credit to his mother, She said he'd make it, the money he'd take it, And all the lyrics are his, he spake it. Next time you see an old box, Rap and rhythm is the flow he talks.  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Well here's the cool story,   I'm on my way to meijer, just to test out my car in the rain cause i washed it with RainX so it would've been cool to see, I know the tornadoes are going around and stuff.  So I'm at meijer and get ready to leave when the sirens go off, and i'm like oh crap they better not make me stay here. So a lady like saw me so I took off down the isle, then she's like SIR SIR!!!! I was like "oh great".  She made me go back into this one room where they do training with all the other meijer people, so I sat there for an hour!!  With Arvid Olsen I might add... good times.  The meijer guy comes in and he's like you can go home but we don't recommend you do, but i left anyway, did't think it was that big of a risk.  The cops wouldn't let me on 26, so I went through some subdivisions and got home, lol.  There was no one on the road so it was so freaky!  When I got home, I just looked outside of my garage at all the stormy stuff, with the moving trees and the lightning and thunder, and it was a huge reality check with the power of God.  He's soooooo powerful!  And this isn't even close to all the stuff he can do.  God is soooo huge, and he still cares about each of us!  That's wild, and that's love.  Just a thought to think about...  So that was a really fun experience, but I'm really jealous of Jordan Brand cause she actually got to see it!  Ugh, that would've been cool!Also I'm made cause I didn't get to buy the new toothpaste I wanted, lol, oh well!  Summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Well guys,    Another school year is over - can you believe it?  I love it!  Sure the trig exam and the physics exam were harder than the english section (470 ouch!) of the SAT for me, but it's all good.  Summer's cool cause there's so much stuff you can do. Fun in the sun is coming up like mustard on a bun you can't stop it, no not none, so now i'm done.  You can do fun things as much as you want, and you can also grow closer to God!  That would make it a truly beneficial summer wouldn't it?  I mean if this summer was going to mean anything at all in eternity, it would mean us growing closer to God. Keep that at the back of your mind, I know it's going to be really hard for me since i'm so busy, but make this summer a great one!  Sum are hard but summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Hey Guys,   I just want to tell you all about this new book that Mr Grimes, Me, Robbie Dupre, Andrew Rolley, And BLOE Flora are doing for kinda' a study every thursday morning.  It's called "It's not about me".  Now, if you know me, I have a tendency to think the opposite!  And I don't have a problem with admitting it, just a problem with thinking it and doing it, lol, anyway, it's really cool.  It starts off by expaining how we as people in this small small world compared to God's Son - ARE THE MOONS!  Jesus is the Sun.  Our whole purpose is to REFLECT, not make our own, light of the sun,  the application is very clear.  We simply need to do exemplify the love that Christ shows us.  Before we where the sun in our lives, but now it's Christ, everything revolves around him.  Keep that in mind!  It's incredible to think that the whole.... everything that will ever be is by him and for him.   summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will

      Hey Guys,   I'm sure most of you have had a chance to hear this song,  it's by Casting Crowns, and it's called Who Am I.  It is an amazing reminder to me.  It gives me so much hope and joy to know that God cares about us, and also tells us who we belong to, God comforts us and tells us that we are His.  But don't take it from me here's the lyrics.  Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're   Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  Pretty Amazing huh?  Keep it real, I'm Will

      What's up Guys!!   It's been so long since I've written on this electronic journal.  Well I really want to let you know the things I've learned on SMITE.  You'll hear alot of these testimonies I'm sure, but it's just really good to experience this kind of trip.  I won't go into detail about all the fun things we did, I will tell you we swam with sharks, I'll try to put a picture in, went to Atlantis (that's a really expensive hotel, that bro kwame had connections with), and we had a great time running their VBS where there was a fight every night, lol.  Anyway, spiritually: 1.  I need to constantly be in the word of God.  Those people knewtheir bible like the back of their hand, and they applied it.  So many times I read my devotions and forget them the next day, I need to be using my Bible as the tool that God has given me to fight against sin, and give glory to God. 2.  I need to be more vocal with my faith, especially with all my friends, I'm a senior now and a lot of leadership comes with that, I think we senior guys and girls need to be "sharpening" one another just like proverbs says. 3.  Witnessing, How often I don't even think about it, if I really am excited about being a Christian, I should tell people the Great News.  Hey this guy who lived, died, for me!  Wouldn't that be enough motivation to tell someone? That's so important.   I hope you enjoy these pictures, if they load...  Summer's almost gone.... Keep it real, I'm Will
