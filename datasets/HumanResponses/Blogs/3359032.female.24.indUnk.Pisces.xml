						   This stems from seeing a poster for the new Harry Potter movie. Basically, I wish I had a destiny that I had to follow. I don't have a great deal going for me just now - yes I have a job (dead end, miserable), my own place (100 miles from where I currently live)...uh, that's it with the good points. Oh, and a grand piano, if we're talking assets. But I'm still dithering about what I'm meant to do with my life. It was easy when I was at university, then I had a plan...but then junior came along, I dropped out with the intention of returning to complete my last year and a half, and it just plain didn't happen. Being a naive first time mother, and beaten into an interesting form of self-delusion by my then-partner, I thought it couldn't be that hard to raise a kid. When reality kicked in I decided it would be far better for me to earn money to support her. It seemed more simple. I suppose it has been the more simple option. I have full-time childcare which I wouldn't have if I was at uni, at least not that I could really afford. Stupidly though, you need it most then for studying. I have my wage coming in so I can buy food...there were weeks when I was studying that I lived on cornflakes. I could do it then, I was only responsible for me, it was so much easier. I just wish I hadn't been so dumb and realised what I was doing.  Prior to now, my self esteem was closely tied into my academic achievements, which were fairly good. Then I left, and it was my looks, because I was helluva skinny after dropping my girl! Then it was my job, and how well I was doing at it, and how it challenged and fulfilled me. And now I don't have any of that. No academic anything, at all, apart from a "loser" certificate otherwise known as a DipHE (loser in my case, because my certificate was meant to say BSc (Hons)) I'm rapidly going downhill looks wise, I think you do once you have a child - I look tired constantly, and still get frickin spots. And I hate my job. I loathe it. It's the same, day in, day out, same old people, speaking the same old shite, pumping more money into our capitalist non-utopia. I take money from people who clearly can't afford it and I'm meant to squeeze them for more, and I can't. I have no chance of promotion anytime soon either. And as you know, if you've read any earlier posts, the relationship I am in leaves a lot to be desired. Case in point - I want another child but it'll never be with the bloke I'm living with right now because if it was left to him we'd be bankrupt. My neighbours had a baby girl this weekend. They have a son slightly older than Junior. They are both very very attractive people, married, obviously very much in love, with the man supporting his wife who still works, just not as much. Now...I get a lot of fulfillment from working (usually) but I would like everything else. Someone who I know could and would support me if the faeces hit the fan, who had the same goals, beliefs etc. But my marketability as a single person ain't that great, especially since I already have a child and not much else going for me other than a wasted life! Ah well...I wonder if Mr Potter knows how lucky he is... Nessie x

						   It was a weird day at work today. I have a really, really nasty cold (as usual, I get rid of one thing and along comes the next). I was taking those cold relief things you drop on your tongue so that it dissolves, but because it's a fine powder I always end up inhaling it. There must be something in that that makes me go completely bonkers. I picked up a cuddly rabbit and started pretending it was Frank from Donnie Darko, and quoting "Frank" lines(..."wake up Donnie"...). Everyone thinks I've lost it. They said today they'd get me committed, so I told them I don't do commitment HAHA I was on a great site last night,  urlLink T shirt hell . It has THE most tacky, tasteless t-shirts EVER. Needless to say, I had problems choosing. (I was taken with the one for a small child that says "Are you my daddy?"). I got one with a clown on the front that says "You must be this long to ride", and another one with a picture of a pair of swallows and in retro writing, surprisingly, "swallows". God knows why, but it gave me a chuckle. The place I live just now has a lot of religious nuts so I don't think the old "Jesus is a homosexual" would go down too well. I also pranked my ex boss with a number of  urlLink nasty cards  , time will tell if he cottons on. I then strangely moved onto "yo momma" jokes for some godforsaken reason. I was ill. I still am. I will go....the lemon powder awaits...my ticket to fly!  Nessie x

						   That's just what I did because I was entranced with Outkast's video for Roses and wondered why I could hear sizzling. Cue cheese everywhere!!  So back to me and my ideal man. As I was watching Outkast I was thinking how different the people I find physically attractive are - Andre from Outkast, singer from Maroon 5, Kevin Spacey, to name a very few. You couldn't really get much different. It's very strange. I think it's all in the eyes though.  So if I was to make a list of what I'd like in a man it'd go something like this: 5'8" and over Non-judgemental. I am who I am. Definitely not superficial...I can't let loose in bed if I think someone's judging me by my stretch marks... Intelligent, but not arrogant about it. Doesn't make me feel dumb if I don't know much about what he's talking about, and doesn't feel dumb if he doesn't know what I'm talking about, so that we learn from each other and fill the gaps in each other's knowledge.  Doesn't put me down and criticise me unless I've done something really stupid and I deserve it, at which point I'd be doing it enough to myself so he'd need to step in and stop me beating myself up about it.  Someone not fazed by me having a daughter. It's not her fault, and she is a gem. I want more kids too at some point, so they would need to be down with that! Actually cares about whether I'm having a good time in bed or not. Sometimes even I'm not sure if I'm faking, because I've done it so much... Encourages my freedom and doesn't try to hold me back - rather he pushes me forwards and supports me all the way Helps me live my dreams Financially independent, so he doesn't turn into number 5 by erasing my entire credit limit in a matter of months. I suppose I mean more financially contributive rather than independent - the blokes I mentioned before were independent. So independent I never saw it. Not bothered by mistakes I've made in my past, but realises that they are why I am who I am now, so they have to have been a good thing in the long-term. They've made me a much stronger and confident person.  Spontaneously romantic. Big gestures are nice, but the ones that really mean anything are the little things, like running a bath for me, or leaving me a love letter if you've had to leave for work before I wake up. And tulips are good.  Open with feelings - I don't play guessing games.  Someone who embraces love, lives off it, who realises life is too short for the unimportant stuff. Someone spiritual but not a zealot. Creative but not tortured! Can put up with me swearing every so often without lecturing me on it Someone who likes the finer things in life. Not necessarily all the time – I don’t know if I could live surrounded by lovely, antique, pretty things that I’ll no doubt break or spill wine on. But someone who, maybe when we’ve got a bonus at work or something, doesn’t look at me like I’m nuts when I suggest going to see a chamber orchestra, and doesn’t break out in a sweat if he sees a restaurant menu where the starters cost £10 upwards.  So that's some of it, anyway. There must be a person out there like that, surely. Problem is, it's probably a tribesman in Namibia or something and I'm destined never to meet them!  I hope I know, if I find him. I'm worried I let him pass me by through being too blind to see when he's wonderful. So if you are my soulmate, and I've met you, and not realised - I am truly sorry, for both of us.  Nessie x

						   Well not quite, but almost. I was listening to my Maroon 5 album (fantastic band, if you haven't heard of them, find out about them now!) and a track called "she will be loved" came on. It was one that pulled on me, because it's about someone who has never been by themselves..."she's always belonged to someone else". I think that's where I've gone wrong. The only time I have been single since I was 15 was for a few months when I was 22/23, and y'know, that says a lot. I bounce from one relationship to another hoping to accidentally stumble across the right one. So when I listen to this song, I'm thinking - she's lucky. At least she's got someone who feels like that!  I kind of make do with what's there at the time instead of aiming a bit higher. I think a lot of people do, and it's sad, but it's like my addiction to sugar. When I was a kid I used to break open the jar with the sugar in it and just eat spoonfuls of it. I remember being in a cafe beside the beach where I used to live, and eating a bowl of sugar cubes that was on the table. Now I've moved on to not being quite so blunt (honest?) about it by piling it into coffee, tea, having chocolate etc. So I'm getting a bit classier with my sugar, so why not my men?  I was writing a personal ad in my head yesterday (I was very bored at work) and I realised that if I actually wrote down my ideal man, I would realise he doesn't exist. I don't know if I've been "making do" because I genuinely think I can find someone like him given time, or what. I do have this mentality of something better will always come along, but it never is better. I want to be in a situation where I don't *want* anything better. I hope that makes sense. I want to be with someone that I'm wrapped up in, that when I'm with him we're the only two people on earth, I want to pine for him when he's away from me, not be glad for the break!  I've been in a few relationships now. I'm a serial monogamist, and I throw myself entirely into it in the beginning until it starts to go downhill in one way or another. Now please bear in mind that I would give Mr Right my soul (not that he would ask for it) but that's how I am with people I love. So if I go over my big 4, I hope you see that it's not all been my fault. I hope it hasn't anyway. The first one was when I was a teenager and at university and I had my own place. The guy moved in without me noticing. You know...one night here, a t-shirt there...suddenly he was a fixture. He was a student too, and did nothing except play computer games. I was studying for a (hefty) degree and working too, and I'd come home after maybe a 16 hour day to find the place in exactly the same state I left it, although he had the day off, because he hadn't moved from the sofa. Literally. It wouldn't surprise me if he had a glass beside him that he was pissing in to save having to get up for that. Plus he didn't contribute anything to our cost of living. So that was one down, although it took me about a year to get the guts to properly cut him off. Number two got me pregnant within 4 months when I was 20 and then proceeded to abuse me mentally and physically, threaten my friends, my family, and our daughter, and forced me to give up my degree course and all my plans for my life. I remember when I was 7 months pregnant he held me down and stuffed packet after packet of paracetamol in my mouth because I found out he had been cheating on me. His big thing was that his wife had cheated on him - he played on that a *lot* - so for him to be caught out as a cheat was a pretty bad prospect for him and he would have rather have created a fake suicide and killed me and the baby. Luckily (kind of) for me, my body was used to me chucking all sorts of (prescription) things at it, so I threw up, my liver processed the rest, and I got merrily on my way. I have left the city I grew up in, with daughter in tow, because of him, and I will forever be ex-directory and will never register on the electoral roll to eliminate the more obvious ways he could find me. So that wasn't one of the better ones. Number three was going through a divorce with 2 kids and was highly traumatised by it. He was the closest I've ever got to my ideal man, and I absolutely worshipped him, but he wasn't ready for anything. So for my own sake I had to cut that one off. It never really got past the initial fairly casual stages anyway. He still plays on my mind, but I know it would never have worked out. He did help clarify some of what I would be looking for though, so that's a good thing. Number 4 I met through work and I am with just now, and he's bleeding me dry. I pay for everything here, and I don't earn that much. He has a crappy job but plenty of experience to get a much higher paid one, but I think he's just lazy and wouldn't want the responsibility that would come with it. We had agreed on a monthly payment from him to me, but there's constant excuses for why he can't stump it up. So at the moment, I am £4k in debt (£3k more than this time last year) and it's growing steadily. He's a good bloke, don't get me wrong. I don't think he'd ever be unfaithful, but I think that would be more because of the hassle of trying to keep it quiet. He doesn't have a clue why I would want to 1) get a better job 2) move cities to get a better job if necessary 3) possibly complete my degree and change career totally 4) ever have more children 5) ever have sex, for that point. I think my not-so-grand canyon will dry up at this rate. But my daughter likes him, and although I know I could do better (here we go!) I also know I can do much, much worse, because I have. I think my biggest issue is that I can't have a conversation with him. He hasn't read a book since he was at school, and I read ALL THE TIME. He has no interest in anything religious or spiritual, and I'm very curious about it. If I mentioned Beethoven, he'd think I meant the dog. If I try and explain anything to him about anything, he just goes along the lines of "yeah, whatever". So it's frustrating, in more ways than one. I feel a sugar headache coming on so I better go and top myself up a bit, and stop frickin whinging! I don't want you to think I'm a moany bitch (although I can be). I might bless you with my "perfect man" list once I've had my obligatory hot sugar water with a dash of caffeine.  Nessie x

						   Was pretty boring. I went and spent 9 hours at work and then came home. It started off a beautiful sunny day (and there's nothing nicer than sunshine in Scotland) then went rapidly downhill. I think I'm becoming a people-phobe, which will be a problem as I deal with the buggers all day. It's kids in particular just now. All those little screeching brats that shove stuff in their pockets when they think you aren't looking then do the whole "my, how did that get there" crap when you collar them. If only you could get parenting licences.  I'm off for a hot chocolate which is my flavour of the month just now, especially with cream from Costa Coffee. Mmmmmm heaven. Might post again later on tonight if I can think of anything pertinent to say! Nessie x

						   I remember when I was a kid I thought a lot about if only I could have chosen my family. But it didn't take too long for me to realise that for the most part, I was lucky. Yes, every member of my family is insane (I'm just a bit messed up, as you'll see if you stick with me, and hence the title!). See I would look at other people's parents and wish I had them. You know the ones...the kind with the flashy car and the big house and the good clothes and the money, and they always took their kids on holiday to Antigua or wherever...but then you find out they hold the parties where everyone's car keys go in the bowl and one of the people their Mum did was your history teacher. And so it goes. Anyway I am in my mid twenties, but I haven't quite gone past the marker for 19 on the road of life. I hit it when I was about 12, when it was good because I was mature, and now I guess I'm chronologically retarded. So I have this whole respectable thing going on - good job, good life, expensive watch - and there's a bit of me inside that keeps screeching "God you're so BORING Nessie, pass me the absinthe". On the other hand, it's great, because it's like I'm acting out someone else's life and that's quite good fun. I harbour secret thespian dreams but I'm too practical and tied down to ever follow them, so this is as good as it gets.  That's pretty much all I need to say right now, you'll get to know me as time goes on. Not sure what the point of me doing this is - I don't think there is one - but what the heck.

						   There's so much going on just now that I keep forgetting things that I would never have forgotten 2 months ago...stupid simple things that I've done at work every day for the past 2 years! It's very confusing.  I have to sell my flat next month, I don't live in the same place now so I'm having to try and organise it from a distance which is doing my nut. I'm building up to getting my Reiki second degree as well. I don't know the person doing it so it's a bit scary. And work's a nightmare as usual. And I have NO money, it's unbelievable, I'm old enough and earning enough to know better but somehow it's all disappearing. Most of it goes on my rent each month, which is painfully pricy. It's a really expensive place here though in general. But now I'm coming off the property market and I won't be able to afford anywhere else. It's very distressing.  Anyway I'm going to go and carry on reading about reiki!! I need to get prepared (need to stop drinking coffee etc three days before...here come the headaches!) Nessie x
