      LoL. Yes life sucks...actually not very much but when you miss someone so much you feel like your heart is going to rip in two pieces....yes that sucks. When your dreams don't help satisfy that longing but make them worse...and make your fears of certain people worse yes that sucks.  Ryan and I went to see I, Robot. It rocked. I got to see Will Smith's ass. Its nice. lmao. And Ryan and I held hands. I expected warmth but what can you expect it felt like it was 30 degrees in there! I was like holy shit its cold. lol  &nbsp; DREAMS SUCK RIGHT NOW! I HATE MICHAEL MACKENNA WITH A PASSION.&nbsp; hehe. I do I do I do. Rich I hate some of the time because he is so perfect but my friend and i already had this discussion. wow...im a disturbed little child. omg im going crazy..kill me...no dont. I want to live. this exctasy is nice.  &nbsp;

       Linkin Park Breaking The Habit Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again [Bridge:] I don't want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I had no options left again [Bridge:] I dont want to be the one Who battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight [Bridge:] I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends [Chorus:] I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Iâ€™m breaking the habit Tonight  urlLink      I'm sorry sis for the ways I've treated you. Inside I am confused...this isnt supposed to happen. We're supposed to be friends forever YOU PROMISED! I can't let go of this friendship. It's not what you want and its not what I want but things change sis. I love you so much and you are the best friend I have ever had and I don't want to let go of that. Theres a quote that says when someone says goodbye theres sure to be a hello to follow but when someone doesnt say goodbye they aren't coming back. Goodbyes are the hardest. That quote isn't true. Or maybe it is...anyway...my sister is sick. bla. She has an infection in her ear canal and has to take VICODIN to relieve the awful pain. My sister the great..the one who never is weak or sick..will fight this...and will accomplish the healing once the infection takes its course. Susie isn't weak...she's the strongest person I know. I have to go..I have swim practice in a bit....Love Always...Court
