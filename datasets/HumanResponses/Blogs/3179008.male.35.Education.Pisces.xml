      Testing has taken its toll on the students. Fortunately we are a little more progressive than most public schools. We were able to reward our students by taking them to a river where we rock hop and swim. The weather has been opressive today, around 95 degrees. Yesterday was a record high for the month of April. Fortunately the kids don't moan about the weather much. I like it.   On the hike down to the water hole on the river one of the students was very scared and concerned about every little thing. It took her around twenty minutes to get down, whereas others took ten minutes. Heck, by the time she got down it was time for us to leave, almost... Anyway, on the way back up, she started to complain and cry about wanting water, and then she refused to move, sitting there on the trail in the full sun light. Thirteen years old and using techniques which are more suite to a six year old. This one is definitely placed appropriately at our school.   Down at the river there was a local girl, looked about 15. She had her dog and a can of beer. Since she is what I call a random, I had to be careful to monitor the interactions between her and our students. Some of our students swarmed around her. She was cool.... not. But she was in a bikini top, which instantly attracted attention from some of our pubic boys. Listening to her was very interesting, as she turned out to be pretty intelligent. She was telling the students all sorts of stuff about the water, and the creatures in it. etc..    Our students get angry or frustrated at school and they say fuck this place it sucks, worst school ever, shit, hell, blah blah blah. Truth is, its the best place a lot of them have been. Anyway, the girl at the river tells me that she thinks our school is awsome for taking the kids to the river. " my school never took us" to the water, she says. Most of the kids heard that, which is far more powerful for them to hear from a "peer."    So, what I thought to possibly turn out to be a tough situation, turned out fine.  More testing tomorrow. Actually, for most of the students it has turned into a creative bubble filling exercise.  Peace, Dave

      testing today !   SAT 9   It is beyond me how the state can mandate testing for this population. They tend to have difficulty in stressful situations. Three hours of testing each day for six to seven days would cause "normal" folks lots of stress. Heck, most of the students at our school don't even have a chance to graduate. The only way the students can get out of it is to have their parents sign a waiver. The catch is, the districts are encouraged to not present exemption as an option. So, most schools say nothing about that possibility, and the parents have no idea.   The irony at my school is that one of the smartest students at our school, which is above normal I.Q in all academic areas, is exempt from the test. His mom has connections. Some of the most fragile, low self-esteemed children are having to take it, even though we know they will fail either by quiting, or taking it. Tlak about screwed up.   Second session of testing is starting...gotta go  Peace, Dave

      Hey there all,   This is the first post for my therapeutic outlet. Welcome!    My name is NorCalDave. I have worked with children for many years. Those I have worked with have been abused emotionally, sexually, physically, and spiritually. I have worked with kids from 2 years of age to 18 years of age. When I first started to work with the younger kids, it was difficult for me emotionally. The types of abuse, ignorance, power play, sickness, and  agendas adults put on kids is one of the hardest things to take in this life.    Anyway, I now get to see, and attempt to help correct, the manifestations of the treatment these kids have endured. No, I mean survived. All of the students I currently work with are survivors. And somtimes I can't help but feel that we are only holding these kids in a survival pattern until the system has no place for them, except jail, the streets, or dead.    Some of the kids at the school are very intelligent, probably more so than their parents in some cases. That smarts is a double edged sword for them. The brains can pull them out of the cycle they're in, or it can facilitate their spiral further away from social functionality.    More background and spout later.....story.  One time, when I was working in a group home, a resident became very upset about not getting what he wanted. To the casual observer it wouldn't have seemed like a tragic moment, but it was for that child. He ended up throwing roof tiles down on the cars of the staff who worked there. One of the staff, who may not have been suited for the job, went up on the roof after the kid, mad. The kid ended up knocking over the top of the chimney, bricks falling down to the ground and in the fireplace. Of course, we never used the fireplace with these kids. The staff did not catch the boy, but he learned a lesson, don't piss off SED kids when your car is near by.     So, it ended up that the kids father was called for help to fix the damage that the child had done. Ten years later, the dad works for the agency as a maintenance worker. And, ha ha, so is the child, who is now 19 years old. He isn't one of those jail,dead,etc. kids, but he isn't citizen of the month either.  NorCalDave

       Today is feels like it is going to be one of those days. I haven't had one for about a year, but I can sense it coming on. I am tired, tired of, and on a tear. I am concerned that I may damage relationships with kids, and possibly staff. I can usually "compartmentalize" my feelings, and self process (self-soothe). Not finding the desire or will today, at this point.

      We have this girl at our school who had been in the agency for a couple of years. She and her brother lived on the streets with their dad for a while, around ages 4-9, eating out of dumpsters, etc... One of her self-soothing behaviors is to suck her thumb. She doesn,'t just suck it, but has the whole thumb in her mouth with her lips hugging the side of her hand. At this point, she is now 15 years old.   This particular girl is very interesting and fascinating. She believes that she has the ability to communicate with animals. Not talk to them, but understand what they need and want. She and her brother are very good at making many different animal calls and sounds. She is an avid reader, with an afinity for sci-fi. Go figure!  It is unfortunate that she has returned to us, because she had previously graduated from the program and moved on to foster care. That fell through; go figure, not having been ready to go. So she has needed to come back to us, since the type of services we provide are rare and unique. She probably doesn't really need the level of services we provide, but another educational placement couldn't be found,....or, money was to be gained...Perhaps she is not as "reformed" as I hope she is.  gotta go

      It has been a while. I have been busy now that there are more students in the class. Plus, we now have two females in the class, which certainly shakes things up in here. It also effects the rest of the classes, since one of the girls we got recently is good looking. She also is "friendly" with males. As you may know from reading earlier posts, most of the students we get are emotionally, sexually, and/or physically abused. This girl has had many relationships with males older than her.    At this point right now, one of the male students is threatening to hurt another male student because he spread rumors about him and this girl. This may appear to be normal type drama for the age range, but this kind of situation can lead kids without impulse control to do drastic things, which can be dangerous and highly regrettable.    She has now just returned to class in tears, manipulation and bipolar episode rapped into one, and has asked me to take space at tables outside, away from the male student in our class. I suggested that she would not be in staff sight, and that the male student isn't in the class right now. She agreed, and asked to use the restroom. I think she will just sit and cry to see who bites. I'm not buying it, but I do have sympathy for the fact that she uses the methods she does; learned behavior. I also have the benefit of know some of the group home staff that work with her. So, I have gotten some inside info. on her behavior at home. And, by saying "behavior," I don't mean to imply negativity, but a nonjudgmental view of other perceptions. Difficult, but I can do it about 70% of the time.   I am not cold-hearted, but I won't help this 17 year old girl unless I make it clear that I am not going to be a part of her methods of operation. Of course, I do this with as much tact as is possible in order to maintain a relationship with the student. What a dance it is.

      There's a student here at the school who has been at the school for longer than 90% of the staff. He is likeable most of the time, but he will turn... Hard to explain. Currently he is roaming the school property, which has construction debris around due to the school being built a year ago. What this boy does is looks for things to make weapons with, and he is quite clever. He has created some num-chucks(?) out of two branches of pine and a piece of chain. He found nails from old wood decking on the property. Unfortunately, this is definitely against the school expectations, not to mention potentially painful. He hasn't really ever intentionally hurt somebody, but has done so in rage and defiant aggressive behavior. I guess it means that he still belongs with us.    Most of the students we get don't stay for more than one and a half to two years. There is a thing in medicine, specifically worker's comp terms, called permanent and stationary. I think we have nothing more at our facility to help this child. We have employed numerous techniques, paradigms, concepts, schemes, and even law enforcement interventions, but to no avail...   I work for the kids, not the system. I don't have to believe in the system in order to help those who are in the system.

      I just spoke to the vocational ed. teacher. He said that he needs to close up the shop because the people who built the place did not meet the fire codes necessary for such activity. The problem is that we are knee deep in wood projects. The retrofitting of the shop class would probably cost around 5 to 10 thousand dollars. That sounds like a lot, but it is truely a drop in the bucket compared to the money brought in to the agency by the educating of the clients. Sometimes I wonder if the folks who began this organization have lost track of their original dreams, goals, ideals, and mission. The child centered approach is being lost in the financial grind.  I brought in a large box of books that I had been saving from when I taught 7 years ago. Most of it is low level math and reading stuff. I guess I am doing this for two reasons. One, the school is very limited in its resources and curriculum is low priority for the admin. ( money ) Two, I am probably deciding that I will not be teaching in the future. Don't know.

      Hey,   What a busy week last week. We had a state audit of our files and school curriculum. That was pretty  stressful. But what really made it difficult was that we had planned a talent show for the kids on Thursday night. We also had a rock climbing outing, which was great. The Feather River is quite a site this time of year.    We also got two new students this last week, and we had a long time student leave. It's great to see them leave, but it also means adjusting to new students. At least, at this point, the culture of the school is strong, and set by the staff. New students generally must conform to the system. Ha ha ha.    A lot of the folks I work with are Kings fans. I am a Laker fan, have been since the early 80s. I also like the Kings, though, having liked Mitch Richmond. Anyway, the rivalry is fun, and it helps to cut the edge off of the stress and drama around here.   The administration has been worried about the student count, and consequently the funding. A suggestion has been made to add 10 days to the end of our already extended school year. We would end the regular year on June 11th, and return the following Monday 15th until July 29th. Yes,...July 29th. That's not all!  We also have a component of the program which usually runs two weeks in August, leaving two weeks for vacationing. The admin. also wants to see the August component extended by two more weeks. All said and done, we, the staff of the school, would essentially get three to five days of summer vacation.   Money, money, money,and more.  The group homes would love to have the school run 12 months a year. The foster care agency would love that too. It would greatly benefit many parts of the agency, but at the cost of the sanity of the school staff. Plus, the teachers would have to have their contracts renegtotiated. Politics. Money. Pushing Agendas.    Breathing,  Dave

      Well since Dave didn't have anything for today I will fill in. I teach in the classroom next door to Dave. My class is the loud, door slamming, wall pounding, screaming neighbor who disrtacts his class. But today was different, four students were asleep, two were out of class and two were actualy working. Sleeping bothers me more then the screaming and yelling of a normal day. Atleast if students are awake they can be engaged with. I have been told that sleeping is an acceptable coping skill, I am having some trouble dealing with that. It is hard for me to accept that education is a secondary goal for this school. My time is put into getting information ready to bring to the class. I have to figure out how to catch their attention while still meeting IEP goals. At the same time I am supposed to be covering 7th,8th and 9th grade concepts that I have to present at a third  or fourth grade reading level. It is not for the value of my time that I worry but to me  behavior modification and education are equal. I don't understand how one can be sucessful without the other. If a student can leave the school because of successful behavior but far behind accademically isn't that a set up? Well finaly time to go home.  I think that I will use the sleeping skill at the next staff meeting and see how well it is accepted. -Marilyn

      Good day all. I wish it really was. I try not to judge the day before it has unfolded some, but I am going to be responsible for the teaching of the students today. The teacher is absent. We, at this here place, do not have substitutes for any position. The problem with me teaching is that I am also responsible for charting the student's goal based behavior. I also don't really want to do it. I am capable; having a credential and experience, but I would be doing it full-time if I wanted to do it. Thre are plenty of jobs in the special ed sector. Pay is low, no respect. Enough of my complaining.  I came into work this morning and noticed that one of our school vehicles had had it's windows left down all night. The doors were unlocked, too. Not that it mattered with the windows down. The fact that it rained last night for about an hour is the problem. The seats and door panels were soaked. The vehicle smells bad enough already. I was the last to drive it on Friday, but another branch of the agency borrowed the vehicle, and basically showed not respect for it. The school gets punked again.  We have a returning student; from two years ago. He is alright. At least he doesn't have violent tendencies, but he is quite talkative. He is also Lakers fan. Cool. It is also good to get another, since our numbers are down.

      Yesterday, one of the "bully" type kids was extra annoying to one of the other students. He is a student with explosive anger disorder. He will "fly off the handle" under circumstance which "normal" kids would be upset about, but would probably not starting yelling, cussing, and threatening harm to people, indiscriminately.   He went too far for this other person to stand, and he received four quick punches to the face. One landing squarely in one of his eyes. One might think that a fight would have occurred at this point, but that was not the case. The "bully," the one who basically antagonized and initiated the conflict, turned around and ran away. He took off. I have been hearing and seeing this students threats and posturing for more than a year now, and when he finally gets the opportunity to prove his medal, he turns tail.   That was not the end of it, though. Once the "bully" was with some adults, who he knew would contain him, he began to try to "save face" with his peers by yelling and screaming threats toward the other student from the other side of the building. At that point the whole school could hear what was going on. Now, at a "regular" school, if this type of thing transpired, it would be difficult for the rest of the students to maintain any focus, and would be dying to know what was going on. That was not the case here, which, on the surface, seems good, but I see it as startling and sad. Most of the rest of the students were able to ignore what was happening, continuing to work. These kids are so accustomed to hearing and seeing violence, and the threat of violence, at their residences and school, that they are largely unaffected by it in many cases.

      One of the students in my classroom has terretes(?) syndrome. About three years ago, when I first met this student, he used to drool on himself and shout out all sorts of words and phrases; as if his mind was not filtering some of the immediate thoughts, and just let them roll out of his mouth. When he was angry he would say stuff like, " fuck you bitch," and " whooooooOOO." He wasn't really aware most of the time, but would apologize or become frustrated when he did notice that he was doing this. Most of the kids were, and are, tolerant. They are very good at ignoring the ticks now. He is on lots of medications, and sometimes the levels are not quite right. He will either be catatonic-like, or ticking like a clock.    Currently he is ticking like a clock. I have been tracking the behavior for three days now, and have come to realize that I was very good at not hearing the ticks. He was vocalizing about three to five times per minute. I noticed that there was a marked increase during his focus on math, and when he is reading. We will have to let the psychiatrist know what is happening. Here comes another med change; probably his tenth in five years.    This particular student also suffers from fetal alcohol and extreme social delay. He is eighteen, but when he becomes angry, or is held accountable for his behavior, he reverts to about four years old. He knows what to do, but when he reaches a certain point reason and impulse control are out the door. The best thing to do is isolate him and keep peers clear of him; cool of period. This is necessary since he is about six foot four inches tall, 300 pounds!   Considering his propensity to intimidate, posture, and threaten physical violence, it's very challenging to maintain peace; recognize the antecedents, prevent other students from "setting up" this student for the fun of it, or the retaliate for events from the past.

       The budget problem here in California is affecting our school. All of the schools have been expected to make huge budget cuts to make up for lost funding. That trickles down to us, even though we are a non-public school. Most of our referrals come from the local school districts. Trust me, the cost for educating these emotionally disturbed youth is great; the amount of resources is also.    So, students who might otherwise be referred to our school for the specialized services we provide, and most of the kids really need, are having to stay in the lower level classes within systems that are not designed, or able, to handle these kids unique needs. Unfortunately this creates, in some cases, an extreme drain on the teacher, staff, students, and schools that these kids are being served at. The only positive is that the school district is saving money. But that is actually negatated by the budget shortage.   A lot of these kids you don't want to be in school with your "normal" kids.

      We took some of the students river rafting on Friday. We have a heavy outdoor/recreation component to our system. It helps a lot of the kids to buy-in to the program, something to look forward to, and work on their therapeutic and academic goals. The water was freezing cold, but we all had wetsuites. Of course the kids wore helmets. I really look forward to these type of outings, as they are also an incentive for me to stay at my job.    On the rafting trip one of the students decided to act as if she had passed out in the water. This raised a lot of concern at the time, and could have endangered those who would have jumped in to "save" her. We yelled to her, and she was non-responsive. Fortunately, we had a staff member down river with a throw bag; he pulled her out of the water. When asked what the problem was, she said she didn't hear us calling to her, but it was clear that she was trying to create drama around her. This is her method of operation. The consequence for her action is basically the worst that can be given, besides suspension. She lost her level at the school. It could take a couple of weeks, or longer, to get back to her level.   We have a progressive level system at the school, which is the cornerstone of our behavior modification paradigm. Each successive level brings more priviledges, and the ability to go on the "high-end" incentive outings. We also have whole-school experiential outings, but again the students must maintain a certain level of safety in order to attend. Those who do not go have academics to occupy them.  I'm going to have one of my workmates write on this Blog. She is a teacher in a different class. I hope she will, because I think she needs the "release" more than I.

      I was moments from not coming into work today. We had a meeting yesterday where we spoke at great length about staff burn out. I guess I hadn't truely realized how much I was feeling the burn out. I really need to take some time off. The problem is, as I mentioned previously, that I am very loyal, and concerned, about my work mates. We do not have substitutes for when someone is absent. So, I run the risk of loosing my sanity at work, or worse yet, going postal on the students. That is very easy to do in a moment of weakness. I am weak right now. I am frustrated with the class set up we have. I am not happy with the way my work mates in my class are functioning. Perhaps they are burned out too. That is a real possibility.  One thing at a time. moment to moment.  breathe . sigh... find the beauty.  Until tomorrow, if I succeed at keeping myself in check.    Peace, D

      The groove may have been found for the moment. It seems to be best to work moment to moment around here. Things have been running more smoothly, and I have resolved to approach things a little differently. It may be working out. I have been stepping back out of the process, leaving my power at the door.  One of the students wants to leave the school the moment he gets here. He always shows up early to let the staff know. He spends the early morning trying to get into the class, and all the rest of the school time trying to get out of the class. Yesterday he hurled an apple at the wall of the school. It exploded, and showered other student with juice and bits. Today he is antagonizing a younger classmate. He actually postured toward him, like he was going to hit him. This student is 16 years old, and the younger one is 9 years old. The problem with this student is that he wants to go home, and we ant to send him home. Therapeutic stand point: home is not a good option. Juggling this act is not fun.   More next week. Staff gathering tonight, should be fun and interesting. Adios.

      We have a new student today. I read paperwork on this child a few months ago. Wow!! I don't say that much, but even the history of some of these kids continue to shock me, and slightly sicken.   We also had just gotten another student last week. Last week's student is 16 years old, history of assaultive behavior. He has a history of "crushing" on female staff, and students. He shined a little on Friday.  This week's student is 9 years old, and history of abuse... very scared... history of hidding under desks and in closets when people raise their voices.  Now we, our class, have the most widest mix of kids, and the widest age range of kids.  It should be very interesting. I have decided to take a different approach to my role in order to passively coerce other staff to work more toward their role. I have had a difficult time completing my paperwork job, which is probably my most important duty. My new idea could assit. Here we go....

      It's been a while. The last week of the regular school year was crazy, and yet it was very fun and satisfying. We took the kids, the ones who were safe, to a theme park. The drive was long, ooooi.  We left early in the morning and returned around 10 p.m.  The next day we were all dragging our heals.   We had a game day in our class on Thursday. Lots of fun, but lots of work keeping kids focused and positive. It was a half day.  On Friday we had a picnic; BBQ, swimming, pinata, watermelon eating contest. It was hot out.  We started the extended year on Monday. Two days of Summer.   Different students, different subjects. No smooth transition...  Haven't found my groove yet.   Not too happy with the setup at the moment... support is lacking... Kids are slacking...  not much .... pherrrt

          Friday, ahhh. I love it. We are leaving the campus to go on an outside activity. The weather is fine, and the water shouldn't be too cold. Last time I went out there with the school, we say two eagles perched on a high pine tree. One was a mother bird with a large fish draped over a branch. The other was smaller, probably a youngster.       The outings are a huge benefit to the staff and the students. Considering the work we do, it isn't surprising that I feel that way.

The promise of a good long vacation should beckon to us, drawing us toward blissful rest. NO, oh no. We are done with the regular school year soon, but we are starting an extended year for our students on the following Monday. 4 to 6 weeks more... ugh.       This crew works an 11 month year generally. Vacation time for rejuvenating the spirit and soul is vital. It's hard to take those vacations at times , though, knowing that there will not be a substitute for anyone who is missing. If there is, it is someone from another class, or part of the other staff. This creates a drain in that person's area, or role. I use my vacation time during the time of year that I am not able to work. I am an hourly employee, so extended breaks can kill my financial situation.      Top Five Reasons to Work With Kids:   5 - They think you really are smarter than they are.  4 - It's o.k. to ask them to wash there hands.  3 - Kids love to be outside.  2 - They tell you about all the new movies (R-Movies!)  1 - You can make fun of them, and it goes over their heads.      Peace

       Two of the girls in my class were talking to each other about the hair on their legs this morning. I have heard these conversations before, but it always strikes me funny that these "young ladies" have to go without shaving their legs due to the risk of self injury; possibly the injury of others as well. One of the girls is blond, and the other brunette. The blond one hadn't shaved in two weeks, but you couldn't tell. The brunette had shaved in four days, and it was noticeable.   The girls who live in the group homes can have the opportunity to shave if they go home on the weekends, or other passes. The community kids generally shave when they like. I guess that is a measure of their success compared to the kids in the group home settings.    It is so easy to take for granted all the hard lessons that were learned all those years ago. Watching these students go through their trials and challenges helps me to remmeber that I struggled too. I have to step back into my childhood thought processing in order to be able to understand, to a small degree...   Life is rough, but there is beauty all around. Everywhere!!!

       What a great weekend I had. I was able to get lots of house work done, and help out a friend moving. The weather was fantastic, and the break from the kids was very needed. I couldn't have expected that my three day weekend would be as rejuvenating as it was.   Sometimes transitions from a long break is difficlut for the kids and the staff, but it was much better than I had expected. Only one of our students had difficulty. She didn't even come into the classroom until after 11:00 a.m. She went into the kitchen and ate ice cream that was left over from a birthday celebration. We are hands off, so there wasn't much I could do. I did, however, not get into a power struggle.    Oh yeah, I did take a wonderful wlak in the park this weekend. I hope to do that again sometime soon.   Dave

       What a burn out I am seeing. The teacher I work with is not filling the students' days with enough to do. The lessons are not well planned, and the way they are presented do not lend to a predictable and stable environment. Speaking of stability,... many staff are lacking this vital element. Patience is lacking, too. I see a neglect to remember that the students we have need extra instructions, not to mention specialized instructional delivery.   So, art is the focus, but not really. The kids love and hate art. They cannot be happy with the process. Self esteem is so damaged that they can't handle producing something that could be seen, and scrutinized, by others. Some of the students have great skill in art, but others refuse to do it, or even try. If they do try, they will end up tearing the project, or throwing it away. They make sure to destroy it.    I have, in the past, saved art from some of the students. I see it as a window to their minds and hearts. Pictures tell stories, color, size, shading.etc   I wish I could do some art with the students, but I need to be focused on preventing inappropriate behavior. So, I do.  ***Todays Happenings***   *Window breaker surely gone. Ye, right. I believe it when it happens.   *New student real rude and nasty to peers. ..trying to annoy peers and staff. That seems to be the goal. She had told her house staff that she would be able to annoy peers, and "get" them.   *Happy to see some of my workmates. Two of them got engaged over the weekend!   *gotta go

      This is the first Monday of the rest of my life. And it is the first of two before I leave on vacaction.   Todays goings on:  * One student is not here ( window breaker ). She may not return, even just a week since we were told to dig in with her. Which was a couple of months after they told us she would be leaving anyday. And so it goes  * Another student is not here ( sleeper ). He wasn't here on Friday either, rarely is. His mother lets him stay home. He has her rapped around his finger. She is to passive with him and his brother.  * We got a new student a couple days ago. She is very much like another student that we have had for three years. That is not good, er, ... it is challenging, the behaviors she presents. A sixteen year old girl with a five year old mentality. She is very vocal, and has poor boundaries with peers...gets into others business frequently.  Gotta go... taking thursday off,...helping to prevent burn out moment by moment.

      What a great weekend. Three wonderful days. I was able to neglect thinking about work for about 95% of the time. I did many physical and natural things. 4X4 ing up in the mountains... discovered a sweeet water hole. I'll be there again.  Now to the fun.  Last week, on Friday, one of the students in my class broke the window of the teacher in the other class ( more on her blog...maybe ). Anyway, that class was able to leave early for their outing. A positive way to look at being scared shitless fromm a dual-paned window being smashed into their room when they were quietly doing art-type work. It appears that the house in which the window-breaker lives neglected to give her her medication in the morning. Considering she is bipolar, and schizo a bit, that was not good. The straw that broke her back was seeing a return student, boy, that she had a crush on. Her head must have been a blender of thoughts and feelings.   Anyway, break time. More tomorrow, maybe.

      It has been a while. I had a break for a week. Loved it. Now I am back doing a Day Treatment component of our school. We do a lot of social skills building and recreational challenges. Today we took the kids out on a lake to canoe. Wow, what a challenge for the staff and kids. We have quite a few kids with us for this part that we the staff don't know. That is not cool. Some of them are just being "baby sat " by us. We are not being monetarily compensated for the services provided. We are doing favors for foster parents, providing respit. Whatever, I am feeling good about having had vacation, and the possibility of having a new position next year.  Maybe salary, and a raise. I do know that I will be in a different class next year, with the older kids. Right on!  Peace Out, D
