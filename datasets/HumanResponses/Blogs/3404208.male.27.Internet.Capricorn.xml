      Well, this is it. My first Blogger post. What to write, ohh what to write. This is actually only my  second ever  blog type post. The first was on some site that I do not recall. For the time being, I'm off to bed as it's late here and I'll need to be attending to my almost 9 month old son in the morning so I must go. If I remember that I created this tonight, I'll post some more tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, possibly the day after that. Who knows really, we'll just have to wait and see what happens ;)

      Well, thanks to a generous person from my local area, I now have the GMail account I was looking for (sort of). Here's how it went. I odered something from EBay two weeks ago, and it finally arrived yesterday. So today I went to EBay to leave some feedback. After leaving the feedback, I browsed my local area in EBay just to see what was around, and noticed three invites to GMail being auctioned. After checking the profiles for the users, I found out one of them was from the next town over (approx. 8KM away). I dropped him a quick note to basically say "Fuck the auction, give me your price and let's do this in person". The went to bed. To my surprise when I woke this morning, he had replied, and generously offered me a  free  invitation just because I was a local resident! I must say that this has probably been the nicest thing anyone has done for me in a long time. To make a long story short, I've "Got GMail!", and am loving it.  Even though I have my own account, if there is anyone out there that would like to send me a second invitation, please do so. If I get another invite, I'll use it to create an account for my 9 month old son, so in the future he can use this service and have an account that shows the resistered date as being during the beta period. If you are as nice as the guy that gave me my first invite was, be sure to send the invite to  pimp[at]hardwaregeeks.com . That's all for now, back to playing with my cell phone. Later.

      I was just browsing around on  urlLink NeoWin.net  for a while and noticed  urlLink GMail  are offering more invites for their 1GB email service. People will do/pay almost anything to get one of these, but I don't understand the facination of it. So it's a 1GB webmail account, whoop-dee-doo. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind having one, but the reasoning for mine would be to make sure that my desired username is available. However, I can't see me getting one anytime soon, as I won't post needless requests for someone else to invite me on public forums, but I guess it couldn't hurt here. So if you or someone you know has an invite for GMail available and would like to help me in my quest to reserve my username, feel free to invite me. Just use my  @hardwaregeeks.com  email address, with the username  pimp  (that's  pimp[at]hardwaregeeks.com ). For now I've got some work to attend to, so I'll be back sometime soon.
