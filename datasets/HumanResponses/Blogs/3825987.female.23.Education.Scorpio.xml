           So I'm talking to another friend online... Who knows why I decided to stay online tonight?&nbsp; I don't usually chat too much anymore.&nbsp; Well, recently there's been one person I chat to once in a while, but not anyone else.         &nbsp;     Well, I've been bored today so I was chatting online and I get a "proposition" from a "friend" (not like someone I don't know or anything - someone I was talking to online) and the conversation goes something like this:         &nbsp;     M: Well, you don't miss something until it's gone.       H: Not true.       M: So you say.       H: It isn't true.       M: Actions speak louder than words.       &nbsp;  Note: I'm now the Queen of Cliches Evidently        H: I'm thirsty.       M: ....         &nbsp;     Point made??         &nbsp;     _________         &nbsp;     Anyhow, I talked to Kathy today.&nbsp; We sat on the deck for a while just chatting.&nbsp; I was telling her about my furniture and how I decided to just buy the bedroom furniture and accessorize my bedroom since I probably wouldn't have any company to sit in my living room. "Not that I'll have company in my bedroom," I quickly added.&nbsp; DEPRESSING!!         &nbsp;     However, this is the rule: I am the sex Nazi. No sex for you, one year!         &nbsp;     When men walk into my bedroom they must click their heels, walk without bending their knees and salute me with their penises, but that's as far as it goes! Or comes for that matter.

           As I'm in ultra-stress mode with moving and recovery and the new job and all, I will be heard from LOTS!&nbsp; IF I have computer access which is a LONG BORING STORY.         &nbsp;     Aside from that, let's talk about the 4th of July:&nbsp; Being the patriotic soul that I am, I MUST CELEBRATE.&nbsp; Considering my condition, I cannot go celebrate at Santee or Fort Jackson as I had hoped, so my other offer is to go with a "friend" who was MORE than a friend a while back here in Charleston.&nbsp;          &nbsp;     Well, I guess I COULD go to Columbia, but it wouldn't be a very wise decision.&nbsp; Then again, "Jessica's Book on Wise Decisions" is only about a page long right now.         &nbsp;     The whole "going with the friend who used to be more than a friend" thing is the most convenient since it's here and would require nothing too much on my part, but (and it's a very big but and no I'm not talking about my ass) the whole emotional portion of it couldn't be too good.&nbsp; All of you who know the 2-year Asshole history will not have to be filled in for that.         &nbsp;     Meanwhile, I tried to drive to the store today and got stranded!&nbsp;          &nbsp;     Oh, and lawyers used to give me headaches when I worked for them and I wondered why and now I KNOW... b/c they make everything so hard! ANARCHY FOR EVERYONE!         &nbsp;     This has been another ADD and premenstrual raving brought to you by me!
