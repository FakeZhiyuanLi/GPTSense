						   Ok.  Everything is inscribed in stone now.  She's moving here.  Who is she?  My girlfriend...no, my wife.  It sounds strange coming from me.  Who would have thought it would happen to me?  The days of casual three month relationships are officially over.  Indianapolis will never be the same.  The house is beautiful.  The neighborhood is perfect.  My son is coming back to Indiana to live with us.  She has a new job.  Life is good.  Things always seem to fall into place for me.  Sometimes it's just a little too good to be true.  I'm not sure what I did in past lives to deserve such good fortune.  I have to continue to be mindful of that karma thing.  I also must continue to learn each of life's lessons as they are presented to me.  Like I tell my students, there's no use in being here and not learning anything.  Summer school is for suckers!  I've got new responsibilities and obligations now.

						   How is it that I got here?  What began as a search for my partner's blog resulted in the beginning of my own.  Over the months, I've read her words.  Occasionally surprised by what I've read.  I guess some things she'd rather say anonymously to a strangers than to the people who know her well.  To say the least, I find it entertaining to read her thoughts as they appear on my computer screen.  Why the title?  Well, because that seems to be the question on the minds of many.  Or is it?  Perhaps, it is my own paranoia.  In my conservative profession, I am as closeted as they come.  I am out to my family and friends, but I am hidden deep in the closet with the lights off at work.  I think some may have been suspicious of me, that is, until I began to wear make-up again.  I think others dismissed me as being young and "different."  I won't call it eclectic because I am tired of listening to all of the people who describe themselves as eclectic.  I'm a young, black woman with locs and musical tastes that are unusual for one who is my age.  I am very New Age.  I'm very much aware of my spiritual existence in the physical world.  Yes, I am one of those people who have made contact with those on the other side.  Not one of the people who believes that they are making contact, but one who knows that they are.  I do it quite frequently actually.  We all have the ability.  It's just that few of us choose to tap into it.  However, some of us have developed our gifts more than others.  I am increasingly becoming more clairaudient and clairvoyant.  It really depends on how comfortable I feel.  The more comfortable I feel, the stronger I become.  I'm not going to use my ability to write books or to obtain my own talk show.  That is, according to one medium I met with recently.  She said that I will use my gifts mostly in my current profession.  My profession allows me to touch the lives of many.  So what began as a search resulted in these words that you see here.  I probably won't write often.  As a matter of fact, I may not return for weeks at a time.  When the mood strikes, I will write.  Mostly, I'll be around to read the words of my partner, Nappilesbyan.  I hope she doesn't mind me mentioning her here.  I haven't asked her if I may make the connection between the two of us. She refers to me as "K" in her posts.  I'll simply refer to her as "T" in my own posts.  My son will be "R," the dogs "P" and "B," and the cats "S" and "J."  This is fun already!  I feel like I'm casting the next Men in Black!

						   I'm not sure why it's so hard for me to post.  Probably because I wonder who actually reads this but then again what difference does it make?  I'll just say whatever with no specific purpose or audience in mind.  I have a difficult time committing myself to anything.  It's amazing I've committed to a relationship.  Life is strange sometimes.  It's strange how one day someone is your closest friend and months later you've lost contact.  It's strange how in college you are forced to make a career decision only to find out years later that you've made a mistake.  It's strange how things that you once cared about aren't as important anymore.  It's strange how what was once inconceivable is now understood.  What other surprises does life have for me?  I wonder.  Why is it that I always seem to miss the past even though at the time I was bored?  For example, when I lived in and attended college in Bowling Green, Ohio I was ready to move on.  I couldn't wait to graduate and begin working.  I don't mind my "grown-up" life, but sometimes I miss my college days.  I miss sitting on the porch at my apartment and watching the rain.  I miss making pizzas with my little son who now feels he is responsible for me.  I miss my friends.  I miss the exploring girls (plural because there was more than a few)and sex with girls.  I talked to my ex-girlfriend the other night.  The only one I've ever loved besides my current girlfriend.  She told me that I required time.  I remember her saying that to me years ago and thinking to myself "What a silly b*tch!"  Looking back, I realized she had a point.  I've always felt like no one knew me better than myself.  I'm like Shrek, you know.  I've got layers!  I've always felt like as my current girlfriend puts it, I've long ago come into myself.  Now, I realize I'm constantly learning new things about myself.  I'm sometimes surprised by what I find.  I'm so much like my parents it's frightening!  I'm not 100% satisfied with my life, but I've felt more content in these "grown-up" years than ever before.  For once, I don't feel like there's some other place I should be or doing something differently.  I'm okay, you know?  I don't like my job (teaching), but at least I have job security, benefits, and a decent salary.  That's more than many people can say in these days of Bush.  I've got plenty to be thankful for. I've got plenty to pray on.  I've been sitting here for the past few months watching and listening as the lives of others unfold.  There's a lot to be said for observation.  Partly, because the observer sees it all from start to finish.  The observer isn't distracted by the actual events and people because the observer isn't involved physically or emotionally.  This one in particular has helped me to understand that there is no magic age of understanding and wisdom.  Everyone does it at his or her own pace.  People are still figuring things out well into old age.

						   I've realized that teaching seventh grade language arts has made me stupid.  No longer I am reading the great works of Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Coleridge.  I'm teaching adverbs to children.  No longer can I rattle off the definitions of literary terms as though I've memorized the Bedford Glossary nor can I tell someone the author or poet by simply glancing at a passage.  In college, I was much sharper than I am now.  Now, I am as dull as the blade in a cheap food processor.  I've decided to go to the library and begin checking out books.  It will prove to be beneficial for both my son and me.

						   Summer is here!  Ahh, yes! It is the season for Country Time Lemonade commercials (speaking of which; where are they?), grilling, dressing less, and children playing in sprinklers.  I love being a teacher mainly for the summer breaks.  It makes 9 months of devilish torture and evil manifesting itself in children worthwhile!  I have nothing meaningful to say today or anyday.  I'm just acknowledging how wonderful the education system is in the United States.  Teachers and students alike look forward to summer breaks, and during the school year the only real ones learning are the teachers.  Students lag behind previous generations and prepare for a lifetime of minimum wage and dysfunctional home lives.   You've got to respect and appreciate our education system today!

						   Culture.  Cultured.  I've been hearing these words thrown around lately.  What does it all really mean?  Does it matter?  What makes one more cultured than someone else?  I grew up to value simplicity although we weren't truly simple people.  I don't believe anyone is truly simple.  Some people enjoy labeling themselves as "simple" or "complex" or "cultured."  Perhaps, it is because I am an English major (though often you wouldn't be able to tell as a result of my "simple" upbringing) that I am fascinated with defining words for people.  People throw words around without truly knowing or understanding the meaning of the word.  Whenever I'm in doubt or want to be precise in my usage, I open up a dictionary.  I recommend that others do this as well.  So let's now take a look at the word "cultured."  Merriam-Webster defines it as cultivated or produced under artificial conditions.  "Cultured" is an adjective.  An adjective describes a noun or a pronoun.  Having said this, I am unsure of why anyone would want to describe themselves as "cultured."  I would describe myself as well versed and witty, but I would not describe myself as produced under artificial conditions.  Just my .02

						   T is in the process of finding herself since she is no longer the person she was in earlier years.  At 30, she isn't the person that she thought she would become.  She has grown tired of activism, and she is slowly settling in to a quieter life.  There are no battles to win.  The revolution is over.  Her life consists of me, a child, a couple of dogs, and a cat.  Her priorities have changed.  She is making grocery lists and buying gardening supplies and outdoor furniture.  To me, this seems like a perfect life.  She was hoping for something more exciting...something like correcting the world's social injustices.  I thought I would be doing exactly what I am doing.  Well, almost.  I'd graduate from college, teach, and be a wife and mother.  I had no other goals in life.  Everything was leading up to this moment.  The only difference is I never planned on sharing my life with a woman.  I thought I'd be married to a man.  My mother told me that every woman's dream was to be a wife and mother.  She prepared me at an early age to be the right man's wife.  I've known little else.  I had dreams of white weddings, marrying into the "right" family, and giving birth to beautiful, healthy children.  As a little girl, I was thumbing through Horchow and Neiman Marcus Home planning out my living room, dining room and bedroom!  To some women including my feminist partner, this may seem like oppression.  I have never felt oppressed.  I felt free from real responsibility and the weight of the world which in my opinion was better left to men (namely my father)!  I was content being a  domestic goddess as I am now.  I don't know very many people who have achieved the things in life they had once dreamed of achieving.  I also don't know very many people who are the same as adults as they were as young adults.  We are constantly evolving and that's ok.  There's nothing wrong with change.  There's nothing wrong with getting to know yourself and being content with the person you meet.  So in closing, sometimes you don't have to dream big to live big.  What is simple in one person's eyes may be complex and satisfying in another person's eyes.  As some rush to further complicate their lives, I sit and enjoy my seemingly humble existence.

						   Okay, so I've done the impossible.  I have become friends with an ex.  We talk.  I don't mind it anymore that she is with someone else (they are in the process of breaking up).  I am also with someone else.  A little more than "with."  I don't miss her as nearly as much.  I am happy.  More than happy, content!  I like that I am able to talk to her.  We talked this afternoon.  I wasn't on the defensive.  She wasn't pointing fingers although she did tell me that I can be evil and God bless T for trying.  Yes, God bless her indeed.  This doesn't mean that I'm going to be friends with all of them (plural of ex, exes?) now.  I don't care if I never speak to the others again.  Not because we ended on bad terms, but because I just don't give a damn.  Part of my motivation must be giving a damn in the first place.  There are orchids among roses.  She was an orchid.  Roses are far too common and ordinary.  Well, at least the red kind.  I prefer the peach roses.  I have closure now.  I am able to speak to her and not lust after her.  I've always been able to wish her well, but now well doesn't have to include me.  I spoke to her this afternoon about my latest orchid.  What do you do?  I sense that she is unhappy.  I've been feeling a little blah myself.  What must I do?  D offered no suggestions.  She said that it happens to the best of us lesbians.  Living with someone is different than dating.  D encouraged me to hang in there and learn what works well for us.  Can you believe that?  D of all people encouraged me to hang in there with the one who reigns after her.  So I'll sit around and think of ways to survive this stage of our relationship.

						   While speaking to a guy friend, I was able to process some things.  Therapy doesn't work for me.  My therapy is talking to a friend or writing in my journal (paper and pen variety) and rereading it once the event has passed.  I learn from reflecting on my past.  I've often said that some of my happiest moments are those when I reflect on an experience after the lesson has been learned.  My guy friend and I were discussing my current relationship.  We've been friends for about three years now, so he has seen them come and go.  To be honest, he was once an admirer of mine as well.  I continue to be in his top five!  So anyway, as I was talking about falling prey to a carnivore I realized that I had made a promise to myself long ago to never be the victim again.  I would never again be naive with my eyes shut to the world.  I would never again think to myself, "Why can't I be good enough for him or her?"  I would begin asking the question, "Is he or she good enough for me?"  I would no longer "work" with someone.  I would no longer settle for less than exactly what I deserved and wanted.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing at all.  What is wrong is that it has become extreme.  I am no longer the victim, but I have become the abuser.  I have not accepted the faults of others.  I do not see myself as ever being guilty or to blame.  It's always the other person and not me.  Some of that is also my father at work.  My father has long told me that it's not  me  but the other person.  Think the movie,  Clueless.   Now, think the conversation between father and Cher when he tells her that someone must be crazy to not be crazy about his beautiful daughter.  It hasn't helped that my love interests, both male and female, have always been the willing victims.  I realized this last night as I spoke to T.  My partners have loved (more like adoration) me to point of just falling short of worship.  I have been put on pedestal after pedestal.  They have accepted me as I am and have not asked that I change.  The only thing that they have required of me is that I "be all theirs and only theirs."  Including my guy friend.  During the course of our conversation, he said that he understands that I am "diva and will treat me as such."  He and others had no problem accomodating me.  I didn't demand it.  It's just the way it was.  So naturally since no one expected more of me up until this point in my life, I remained the wealthy landowner and my lovers were my serfs.  Going back to the victim/abuser thing, I viewed this arrangement as my reward and right.  I felt I had turned things around from the one terribly sour relationship that I had.  Hell yeah I felt that I'm worth it!  After everyone has inflated me, my girl has deflated me.  Years and years of worshiping false gods (namely me) and now I am to feel equal and be thoughtful of someone else's needs.  It's about time!  I am not angry or disappointed.  I am grateful for each and every lesson God and spirit has for me to learn.  It's all a part of the process.  If I am who I believe that I am (a spiritualist now that I have a name for my "religion") and what I claim to be (a sensitive, a budding medium) then I understand that this is earth school and I'm here to learn!

						   Tonight, we had official family business to discuss.  My father and all of his brothers and sisters (my cousin and I sat in as witnesses) discussed the estate and my grandparents' legacy.  I was amazed but not surprised by how organized they are despite their great loss.  I have a wonderful, close-knit family.  At the meeting, I commented on how it is obvious that they are my grandmother's children.  They are kind and respectful to one another.  My cousin and I were given the task of opening each and every card and reading them.  We were also to count and make a note of any monetary gift.  I read the notes from people expressing how much they loved my grandmother.  One person wrote, "We loved her, too."  Another person wrote, "I'll always remember her smile!"  There were numerous cards and checks written in her memory.  As my aunts and uncles listened to my father (who was long ago appointed family leader in the event my grandparents' death), I sat thinking how proud Granny must be.  She must know that she raised her children right.  There were no squabbles only love and support.  Granny would not allow me to remove any pictures from her photo albums when she was alive.  Tonight, I removed my father's military pictures and two pictures of Granny and Papa in their younger years.  I didn't dare tell my aunt who has been appointed "the decider of what may be taken and what must remain."  I knew she wouldn't allow it.  I slipped the pictures into my pocket for safe keeping.  I was aware of Granny's presence.  I don't know whether or not she approved of my "stealing" pictures or if she just simply laughed.  I said aloud, "Granny, I know you told me not to take pictures from the photo album but..."  Then the pictures disappeared or rather they had been misplaced somehow.  I looked frantically for the pictures while my cousin searched for pictures of her own Daddy.  Then after 10 minutes or so I found the pictures.  They were hidden between the pages of another photo album.  How they got there no one knows.  I had put them on the washing machine (we were in the basement).  In my mind, I could hear Granny laughing.  I know she's around.  I know she loves me anyway.

						   On December 25, 1930, the most wonderful thing happened!  A baby girl was born in Waynesboro, MS to a Baptist minister and his wife.  This child grew to become a beautiful woman who possessed something that is very rare, a pure heart.  This woman was my grandmother.  My grandmother taught me that you don't need a whole lot of big words to say a whole lot.  My grandmother taught me that at the beginning of each new day the most important question on your mind should be whether you would like bacon or sausage for breakfast.  My grandmother taught me to eat well (which didn't mean low fat and low carb but to eat plenty of macaroni and cheese, deep fried Lake Erie Perch, and Toft's ice cream).  My grandmother taught me to be prayerful, lady-like, humble, and honest.  The greatest lesson she taught was respect which we call "home training."  I have shared so many memorable moments with my grandmother.  Most of the memorable moments were uncomplicated and quiet. Granny was quiet and soothing.  Her voice always remained low and calm.  She was rarely angry and never mad.  She would not express her own physical pain because she didn't want to burden anyone with her troubles.  She always felt blessed for each new day.  I didn't know Granny feared anything but God until two years ago.  She sat late into the night/early morning as I kept vigil telling me how afraid she was of dying alone.  She feared the unknown.  I reassured her that everything would be okay when the time came.  I told her everything I knew from books I had read to my own experiences with death and the afterlife.  My grandmother was a deeply religious woman, but she accepted my metaphysical thought and opinion as truth.  She remained non-judgmental her entire life.  On Friday, July 2, 2004, her time came.  She didn't die alone as she had feared.  She died with her hand in her sister's hand suddenly and quickly.  I don't know if she felt pain or not, but what I do know is she didn't die alone.  She died with someone holding her hand in the physical realm as others stood by in the spiritual realm ready to receive her.  And now I know there is someone in the spiritual realm who I have known personally and loved dearly waiting to receive me when my time comes.  I am comforted by this.  I was worried about who would meet me because no one close to me has ever died.  I know Granny will be there just as I remember her in this lifetime (until I get adjusted to her new being).  I hope that when I die I wake up in the spiritual realm in a bedroom similar to the one across the hall from the bathroom at 1930 Clay Street.  I hope to smell bacon frying in the kitchen and hear the sweet, lulling voice of my grandmother saying "Kim, are you up yet?"  I will rise from the bed planting my feet into the blue carpet and stand in the sunlight coming in through the small window.  As I walk into the kitchen, there will be Granny with pink foam rollers in her soft, silken hair and light pink slippers on her feet frying bacon and turning over eggs.  What a perfect introduction to heaven!  I love you, Granny, for all that you are.  I love you, Granny, for bringing forth life abundantly!

						   I had a dream about Granny.  Only it wasn't what I expected.  I was hoping she would take me for a tour through her heavenly home and gardens.  Instead she decided to drop in on a dream already in progress.  I was walking away from something or someone or maybe I was trying to walk to another place in my dream.  As I was walking, there was Granny standing before me.  Even in my dream I was choked up because I knew that she was dead.  She didn't say anything which was another disappointment.  She stood there beside my brother (yeah, he was in my dream too) smiling.  She wore a familiar red sweatshirt and turtleneck.  She looked as she had looked before the onset of illness, healthy and vibrant.  The way I remember her.  I stood staring at her as though I was staring at a photo.  She just smiled her quiet Mattie smile and continued looking back at me.  All of this must have startled me after a while because I woke up briefly before falling asleep again.  At least, I got to see a glimpse of her.

						   As I sat and watched  urlLink Charms for the Easy Life  this morning, I couldn't help but smile and to think how nice it would be if it were only that easy anymore. I have to admit that the budding romance between Margaret and Tom was charming and sweet to the say the very least. Again, I sat thinking I was born in the wrong time. How I would love to be "courted" by someone and not "dating." Forgive me if I offend any lesbian sisters in cyberland or angry feminists who are fighting for their right to open doors for themselves. What's wrong with wanting to be respected, romanced, and treated like a lady.  I don't know of any men (including the few sweethearts I've dated) who would think to send me a box of his "artifacts" for Christmas. I don't know of many women who would appreciate such a thoughtful, inexpensive yet priceless gift from a man. Contrary to the opinion of a few, I would appreciate such a gift.  What has happened? Where did we go wrong? When did we go from "courting" to sexual liberation and casual dating (sex)? I'm still trying to figure it all out. Change is not always progress or good. Today, we think we are independent women and feel proud to express ourselves sexually without guilt or labels. However, I disagree. What's good for the masses isn't always good for me.
