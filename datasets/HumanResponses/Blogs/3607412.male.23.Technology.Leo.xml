      Military Retirement  The Pentagon recently found it had too many generals and offered an early retirement bonus. They promised any general who retired straight away his full annual benefits plus $10,000 for every inch measured in a straight line between any two parts of the general's body, with the general getting to select any pair of points he wished.  The first man, an Air Force general, accepted. He asked the pension man to measure from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. Six feet. He walked out with a check of $720,000.  The second man, an Army general, asked them to measure from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. Eight feet. He walked out with a check for $960,000.  When the third general, a grizzled old Marine, was asked where to measure, he told the pension man ... "From the tip of my penis to the bottom of my testicles." The pension man suggested that perhaps the Marine general might like to reconsider, pointing out the nice checks the previous two generals had received. The Marine insisted and the pension expert said that would be fine, but that he'd better get the medical officer to do the measuring.  The medical officer attended and asked the general to drop the pants. He did. The medical officer placed the tape on the tip of the general's penis and began to work back. "My God!" he said. "Where are your testicles?" The general replied, "In Vietnam."

      America needs to wake up! That's what we think we heard on the 11th of September 2001 (When more than 3,000 Americans were killed) and maybe it was, but I think it should have been "Get Out of Bed!" In fact, I think the alarm clock has been buzzing since 1979 and we have continued to hit the snooze button and roll over for a few more minutes of peaceful sleep since then.   It was a cool fall day in November 1979 in a country going through a religious and political upheaval when a group of Iranian students attacked and seized the American Embassy in Tehran. This seizure was an outright attack on American soil; it was an attack that held the world's most powerful country hostage and paralyzed a Presidency. The attack on this sovereign U.S. embassy set the stage for events to follow for the next 23 years.   America was still reeling from the aftermath of the Vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the Soviet Union when then, President Carter, had to do something. He chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert. The ill-fated mission ended in ruin, but stood as a symbol of America's inability to deal with terrorism.  America's military had been decimated and downsized/right sized since the end of the Vietnam War. A poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start. Shortly after the Tehran experience, Americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the Middle East. America could dolittle to protect her citizens living and working abroad. The attacks against US soil continued.   In April of 1983 a large vehicle packed with high explosives was driven into the US Embassy compound in Beirut. When it explodes, it kills 63 people. The alarm went off again and America hit the Snooze Button once more. Then just six short months later a large truck heavily laden down with over 2500 pounds of TNT smashed through the main gate of the US Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut and 241 US servicemen are killed. America mourns her dead and hit the Snooze Button once more.  Two months later in December 1983, another truck loaded with explosives is driven into the US Embassy in Kuwait, and America continues her slumber. The following year, in September 1984, another van was driven into the gate of the US Embassy in Beirut and America slept. Soon the terrorism spreads to Europe. In April 1985 a bomb explodes in a restaurant frequented by US soldiers in Madrid. Then in August a Volkswagen loaded with explosives isdriven into the main gate of the US Air Force Base at Rhein-Main, 22 arekilled and the snooze alarm is buzzing louder and louder as US interestsare continually attacked.   Fifty-nine days later a cruise ship, the Achille Lauro is hijacked and we watched as an American in a wheelchair is singled out of the passenger list and executed. The terrorists then shift their tactics to bombing civilian airliners when they bomb TWA Flight 840 in April of 1986 that killed 4 and the most tragic bombing, Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 259. Clinton treated theseterrorist acts as crimes; in fact we are still trying to bring these peopleto trial. These are acts of war. The wake up alarm is getting louder and louder.   The terrorists decide to bring the fight to America. In January 1993, two CIA agents are shot and killed as they enter CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The following month, February 1993, a group of terrorists are arrested after a rented van packed with explosives is driven into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people are killed and over 1000 are injured. Still this is a crime and not an act of war? The Snooze alarm is depressed again.    More attacks continue. In November 1995 a car bomb explodes at a US military complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia killing seven service men and women. A few months later in June of 1996, another truck bomb explodes only 35 yards from the US military compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It destroys the Khobar Towers, a US Air Force barracks, killing 19 and injuring over 500. The terrorists aregetting braver and smarter as they see that America does not respond ecisively. They move to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. These attacks were planned withprecision. They kill 224. America responds with cruise missile attacks and goes back to sleep.   The USS Cole was docked in the port of Aden, Yemen for refueling on 12 October 2000, when a small craft pulled along side the ship and exploded killing 17 US Navy Sailors. Attacking a US War Ship is an act of war, but we sent the FBI to investigate the crime and went back to sleep. And of course you know the events of 11 September 2001. Most Americans think this was the first attack against US soil or in America. How wrong they are.   America has been under a constant attack since 1979 and we chose to hit the snooze alarm and roll over and go back to sleep. In the news lately we have seen lots of finger pointing from every high officials in government over what they knew and what they didn't know. But if you've read the papers and paid a little attention I think you can see exactly what they knew. You don't have to be in the FBI or CIA or on the National Security Council to see the pattern that has been developing since 1979.  The President is right on when he says we are engaged in a war. I think we have been in a war for the past 23 years and it will continue until we as a people decide enough is enough. America needs to "Get out of Bed" and act decisively now. America has been changed forever. We have to be ready to pay the price and make the sacrifice to ensure our way of life continues.  We cannot afford to keep hitting the snooze button again and again and roll over and go back to sleep. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto said "...it seems all we have done is awakened a sleeping giant." This is the message we need to disseminate to terrorists around the world. This is about our Freedom and the Freedom of our hildren in years to come.

      President Bush entered the White House in the wake of the bitterly contested 2000 election. Once in office, Bush put aside the Florida controversy and pushed for the passage of his tax cut bill and education plan. He signed into law modified versions of both. With those two great victories on the domestic side the President didn't look to revolutionize American foreign policy, but that's exactly what he did.    When President Bush entered office he pursued a very different approach from his predecessor, staying out of the Middle East and taking the United States out of a series of international agreements. These international agreements included the Kyoto global-warming treaty, a biological weapons agreement, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the International Criminal Court, and he withdrew the United States from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty much to the dismay of the world community.   Then the September 11 attacks happened and changed the Bush presidency forever. The world praised Bush for his handling of the events and he made a well-received speech to Congress, notable for this blunt line: "Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done." This was the first glimpse of the new direction Bush was taking, two months later America invades Afghanistan and overthrows the Taliban regime for their support of terrorism.   President Bush was now ready to introduced America and the world to the concept of pre-emption. He lay to rest the Cold War doctrine of containment, replacing it with a new national security strategy which holds that the United States must not let its enemies strike first. "After September 11, the doctrine of containment just doesn't hold any water." he said. "We must deal with threats before they hurt the American people again." Bush seemed ready to put his plan to action.  On March 20, 2003 President Bush order the invasion of Iraq, despite the lack of international and U.N. support (but with the backing of Congress and a high majority of the U.S. public). The US lead "Coalition of the Willing" seized control of Baghdad in April 2003 and Bush declared an end to major combat in early May. Although spermatic fighting still exists in Iraq that War has been an unbelievable success, freeing the Iraqi people and giving them hope for a prosperous future and pre-emption worked.   The concept of pre-emption is the right Foreign policy for America. No longer are we constrained by world opinion and their views toward us, although we must not abuse this. We can not be held down by another country or the world community. If America sees a danger brewing we have every right to take steps to protect ourselves. No longer is our security in the hands of other countries.   President Bush went to the UN and international community trying to find a solution for the Iraq "problem" before the war, but nothing was done. The UN had a loud bark but no bite. Saddam Hussein knowing that disobeyed all of the UN resolutions passed by the security council. The threat just grew and grew until something had to be done. Bush quickly solved that problem.   Critics will argue that once America has done something other countries will follow. Many say now that America has used pre-emption what stops countries like China or India from using it? I believe there shouldn't be anything from stopping them. If the threat is real and viable then they should be able to protect themselves by any means available...if the threat is real, but not for any aspirations of conquer or empire.   President Bush went from being a governor untested in national politics to changing the way America handles it's Foreign policy. In 3 shorts years America has adopted and embraced Bush's pre-emptive policy and it has caught the attention of any nation or group of individuals that's wish harm on our great nation. The attacks of 9-11 awoke America to the dangers of the world and America will never be the same again.
