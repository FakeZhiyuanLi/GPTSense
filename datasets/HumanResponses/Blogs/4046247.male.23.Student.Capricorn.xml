       Geoffrey Porter, an Africa specialist, has written an excellent opinion piece about Libya in today's New York Times, entitled "The Faulty Premise of Pre-emption" and available at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/31/opinion/31porter.html .  The article caught my attention in part because yesterday a fundraising letter from President Bush was erroneously mailed to my house.  In it, President Bush boldly argued, before asking for money, that his policy in Iraq was the stimulus responsible for the Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi's recent and much touted public abandonment of his weapons of mass destruction programs.        Porter strongly criticizes Bush for linking the Iraqi invasion to Qaddafi's recent action.  To explore the Libyan dictator's real motives, he analyzes the historic, economic and political reasons for Qaddafi's about-face, and concludes that Qaddafi renounced WMDs b  ecause he needed more money to stay in power.  Porter writes that Libyan oil revenues, employed to prop up Qaddafi's Arab "Jumhuriyat," have long been diminishing due to the UN-US embargo; a lifting of this embargo would bring Libya (1) new oil markets like the US and (2) better oil extraction technology.      Further, Porter contends that because Qaddafi "did not respond" to Reagan's 1986 bombing of his palace, Bush is wrong to assert that the Iraq war greatly influenced the Libyan's behavior.   (Porter concedes that "[i]t is possible that the Bush administration's policy did nudge Colonel Qaddafi forward," yet he refuses to explore the precise whys and hows of this "nudge.")      Porter's article is problematic for the following reasons:      1) NOBODY, INCLUDING PORTER, REALLY KNOWS WHY MUAMMAR EL-QADDAFI DOES WHAT HE DOES.  He is not necessarily the same man today that he was 18 years ago.  To remain in absolute power for as long as Qaddafi has (exactly 35 years and 1 month) requires strategy and cunning.  Porter accurately notes that Qaddafi began his quest for normalized ties with the West before the September 11 attacks; he also provides prescient conjecture as to Qadaffi's economic motivations.  (He might have added that Qaddafi is a sworn enemy of al-Qaeda, with a compelling interest in seeing the terrorist organization extinguished.)  Nevertheless, I believe that Porter is mistaken to discount the role of the Iraqi invasion in spurring the Libyan dictator to renounce his weapons programs, after decades of international brinksmanship.        It is eminently plausible that Gulf War II, the first incidence of "regime change" directly orchestrated by a Western power in the Muslim world in a very long time (excluding tactical/logistical support for domestic insurrections and coups), greatly influenced Qaddafi's actions.  Gulf War II is distinguishable from Reagan's attack on Tripoli, which came only three years after the terrorist bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut (which killed 241 soldiers and caused America to withdraw from Lebanon).  The Tripoli bombing was a substitute for invasion and it did not presage direct intervention.  It is unsurprising that a man like Qaddafi would "not respond" to the Tripoli bombing, but be cowed by the forceable removal of Saddam.  Nor is it   illogical or misleading to state, as Bush and his advisers have, that the realization of a preemptive American foreign policy in Iraq played a key role in motivating Qaddafi to forswear WMDs. .      2) PORTER COULD HAVE CRITICIZED BUSH'S "PRE-EMPTION DOCTRINE" MORE EFFECTIVELY.  He could have underlined the fact that Qaddafi and Kim Jong-Il are two very different kinds of revolutionary leaders, and that what frightens the former into acting cooperatively might encourage the latter to lash out impulsively.   Qaddafi, who is something of a Nasserite or an attempt at an Arab Fidel Castro, is more outgoing and hungry for adulation in the capitals of the Third World than Kim.  Kim is retiring, reclusive, and perhaps without much confidence in himself (unlike Qaddafi, who staged a gutsy coup d'etat to oust King Idris I in 1969, Kim, the scion of a communist absolute monarchy, inherited his position).  He has absolutely no regard for his people, and is willing to starve millions of them in order to keep his country poor and brainwashed and his "hyper-dictatorship" intact.      To be continued....

       I remember four years ago this summer, during the campaign for the presidency of Mexico, seeing a photo in the Houston Chronicle of an unforgettable scene from the Yucatan: a mass of people, almost all of them men, dressed in guayaberas and white straw hats, listening what seemed like intently and passively to a  speech by the local boss.  You couldn't see details of the men's faces, but just the rough outlines of their heads tilted in the direction of the party boss, who was standing on a platform in the shade raffling off washing machines to supporters of Francisco Labastida, the ultimate candidate of the PRI, the Institutional Party of the Revolution.  The photo was a quintessential example of something that is emblematic of Mexico, and emblematic of the lugubrious beauty of the Yucatan (its sky blue waters, its limestone, its caste wars and its fevers), with nostalgic mustaches, guayaberas, and white straw hats.         The genocide charges against Luis Echeverria were easily thrown out.  According to the court, the expiration of the statute of limitations on genocide is dispositive.         Yet the honorable judge who dismissed the writ against Echeverria must not, in my opinion, have thought that Echeverria was guilty of ordering the killings of students in the 1970's.  Otherwise, I think, he would surely have found a way to hold him accountable.  I am convinced.         What well-educated man of laws, and what student of the Mexican Revolution and its Constitution ( la ley de amparo , which another judge taught us when we were in Guanajuato), could in good conscience permit the architect of a dirty war to escape trial?  Didn't the Mexican Revolution gave birth to more than corruption and dirty war?   Surely it must also have created good men.    ( Was there a bribe, jaundiced, disillusioned, or venal, paid by somebody to somebody else. )       Yet at least Mexico today is not the dictatorship of the days of the titans.  Four years ago, Mexicans rejected Labastida and voted for Vicente Fox Quesada.  This was a monumental breakthrough in the history of the Republic, as so many noted at the time and have emphasized since.  Like the Taiwanese did to the Kuomintang with Chen Shui-bian, the Mexicans somewhat calmly ushered out their old rulers, and anointed the opposition in a manner that was not very vengeful -- and without dismantling the institutional party in the manner of the East Europeans and Russians, who smashed statues of Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky in 1991 outside of the headquarters of the KGB.       The new ruler that Mexico chose was not, despite the usual hopes and the usual promises that are directed at the mestizos and the Indians, a messiah in the Brazilian style, like Getulio Vargas or Janio Quadros or Jo√£o Goulart.   Also, there was no climactic euphoria, no tears were be wiped from their eyes, and there was no olive green ( verde olivo ) .   Instead, the new president projected and projects an image of competence, business acumen -- all the attributes of the North American company that he worked for -- and integrity.         I should say that there is no doubt in my mind that Fox is an honest man.  But Mexico is still waiting and ill at ease, and most of the country is no longer (Juan O'Gorman, we must say it!) in the shadow of Something that has become irrelevant (the inheritance of dreamers and of losers).                   The New York Times ran an editorial today on the dismissal of charges against Mexico's ex-President Luis Echeverria.  You can read it online at  urlLink www.nytimes.com/2004/07/29/opinion/29thu3.html .

       I like to think that I have a certain intimate relationship with the people of Mexico for a plethora of reasons, and partly because of all the things that have happened while I have been in their country.  On my first trip there, Luis Donaldo Colosio, a reformer and candidate for the presidency, was assassinated in Tijuana.  Years later, I was present for the election of Vicente Fox.  I remember the car horns blaring and the celebrations.       On Friday, July 23, when I arrived in Mexico City, charges of genocide were filed against Mexican ex-President Luis Echeverria.  The next day they were thrown out due to a statute of limitations.  It will not surprise me if Echeverria, who ruled the country with total power from 1970-1976, dies a free man, despite the fact that Saturday's decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court.         Luis Echeverria and others like him (the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the French Vichy collaborator Maurice Papon spring to mind) are old men now, and the regimes they led or served belong to another era.  But especially when I was actually on Mexican soil, I couldn't help feel the tragedy of Echeverria's escape from justice.   It is a catastrophe, a seething catastrophe.    This man should be forgiven, as all men should, yet he ought not escape trial.  As Interior Minister under President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, and later as President himself, Echeverria was surely aware of, complicit in, and, ultimately, responsible for the repression of dissidents and the killing of many students.  For example, Diaz Ordaz and Echeverria had everything to do with what happened at Tlatelolco.       If somehow he were forced to acknowledge his guilt, perhaps Echeverria would defend himself by declaring that his crimes were justified by the exigencies of the Cold War.  After all, such an argument has been advanced by many of Echeverria's supporters.       But who can buy it?       As President, Echeverria was a big leftist -- particularly when he travelled abroad.  He was "Mr. Nonaligned" and Mr. "Tercermundista."  His government had close ties with Fidel Castro.  Rhetorically at least, it allied itself with the Marxist liberation movements in Africa and in Asia.   Echeverria spent enormous amounts of money on government superprojects, as did his recently deceased sucessor Jose Lopez Portillo, who built himself an enormous mansion on the outskirts of Mexico City and proclaimed loudly that his nation's newfound oil wealth would catapult it into the ranks of the First World, thanks to massive outlays.  No doubt, Echeverria and leaders like him were good at the old style fakery.  They were the kind who grandiloquently hosted Spanish Civil War Republican veterans and writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so as to parrrot their moral supremacy while simultaneously "taking care" of Mexican youths who fell too far out of line.       Now the great President is old.  What shall, and what should, become of him?       What do these questions mean for Mexico?

       GO DEMOCRATS!    &nbsp;  I just want to say that I really appreciate the&nbsp;content of the speech given by&nbsp;President Carter at the Democratic Convention last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;He and other Democrats&nbsp;have consistently raised important criticisms of the Bush Administration's method of initiatiating and conducting the war in Iraq.    &nbsp;  I supported the Iraq war two years ago&nbsp;--&nbsp;and I support it even today --&nbsp;because&nbsp;of my belief in human rights.&nbsp; In the fall of 2002 and then in the spring of 2003, I reasoned that, no matter the Bush Administration's true motives for intervention, humanity would be best served by the removal of Saddam Hussein from power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians, in my opinion, always have an obligation to oppose and combat&nbsp;dictatorships.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors Without&nbsp;Borders and of Doctors of the World&nbsp;(whom I had the great&nbsp;privilege of hearing speak in March 2003),&nbsp;has had the most admirable position on Iraq from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kouchner&nbsp;sharply criticizes European leaders for their apparent lack of concern about Saddam's human rights abuses, yet is balanced and also&nbsp;criticizes the Bush Administration for: (1) failing to provide concrete evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction&nbsp;to the United Nations;&nbsp;and,&nbsp;(2) going to war in the face of&nbsp;Messieurs Blix and al-Baradei's reports of Iraqi compliance with U.N. inspection regimes, and&nbsp;Saddam's (grudging) destruction of al-Samoud missiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kouchner, whose convoy in Kurdistan was once fired upon by Iraqi troops,&nbsp;and who&nbsp;personally witnessed the carnage at Halabja,&nbsp;recognizes the bitter ambiguities and ironies&nbsp;of the Iraqi question.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;deeply respect and appreciate this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     (I am a law student at the University of Texas and I am 23 years old.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe in the study of law&nbsp;-- although I am not very good at it -- and in the role of the law, particularly the English common law, in the development of democratic and representative governments.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp;even though I do not believe that&nbsp;I am&nbsp;frittering away my time in an epoch of national crisis, I acknowledge and am not oblivious to the difficulty&nbsp;of supporting a political line that, of consequence,&nbsp;calls upon others&nbsp;to make the ultimate sacrifice.&nbsp;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Bush has to go.&nbsp; The Iraq war has certainly&nbsp;generated a morally beneficial&nbsp;result, but there are too many things about its execution that were faulty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I'm not saying t  hat a multilaterally-initiated liberation of Iraq would have been more succesful, and would have been more readily accepted by&nbsp;the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Iraqi Christians, and Turkomen.&nbsp; In my view, Iraq's ethnic, tribal, economic and religious divisions are, at least for the foreseeable future, an indelible feature of the country's political landscape, with which any intervention/reorganization would inevitably have&nbsp;had to reckon.&nbsp;)&nbsp; I'm not blaming Bush for everything, mind you!&nbsp; Any Iraq war, no matter how&nbsp;prosecuted, was bound to open a Pandora's box of crises.&nbsp; All I'm saying is that&nbsp;the President&nbsp;has set us back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our "go it alone" attitude&nbsp;has only bred&nbsp;hatred for our country and made it harder&nbsp;to win the genuine&nbsp;loyalty of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  It's time for a change in the Oval Office.&nbsp; No more faultily prosecuted Iraq wars!&nbsp; No more irresponsible tax cuts and economic overstimulation!&nbsp; No more scuttling of&nbsp;international compacts like the Kyoto Accords!&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;to lead by example when it comes to the environment, even if India and China&nbsp;stubbornly resist changes that would reduce the megacloud of pollution that hangs over&nbsp;southern and eastern Asia.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  GO DEMOCRATS!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I just returned yesterday from a weekend in Mexico City, and I had an interesting time there.&nbsp; I live in Texas, and so the flight is not long.&nbsp; You hear a lot about how dangerous Mexico City is, but that shouldn't deter anybody from going and getting a great dose of culture.&nbsp; While there, I walked around the central square (the Zocalo) and the Catedral Metropolitana, and saw Maximilian's palace in the Bosque de Chapultepec, as well as the fantastic Anthropology Museum.&nbsp;

       As of late this morning, we understand that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has overwhelmingly won a critical referendum on the continuation of his rule. The result of this referendum, which the OAS and the Carter Center appear to be in the process of certifying as free and fair, must be respected, so long as it is clear and evident that Mr. Chavez leads Venezuela by the mandate of the Venezuelan people.       Mr. Chavez is the dreaded enfant terrible of the Venezuelan upper class, a combination of populist and revolutionary. His mission involves removing the elite from positions of economic power and influence throughout the country, and using the state oil company, PEDEVESA, Petroleos de Venezuela, to fund expanisve social programs.       We can debate the good and bad points of the Chavez regime all day long. It has its positive aspects. Clearly, Chavez has done more to lift the Venezuelan people out of poverty than his incredibly corrupt predecessors, like Rafael Caldera and Carlos Andres Perez. I couldn't see either of those two leaders making a sincere attempt at doing anything to alleviate the misery that stalks much of the nation, which, like Nigeria, its African counterpart in OPEC, has learned the difficult lesson that oil is, as an analyst in  Foreign Affairs  put it years ago, a curse for developing countries, a reinforcer of social stratification and an invitation to waste and massive spending on vain infrastructural superprojects and unnecessary military equipment. The elite in Venezuela, much like the elite throughout Latin America, have in Hugo Chavez the leader that they deserve; his Bolivarian Revolution is an answer to their oppression of centuries, to their historic rape of the land, the Indians, and the African slaves, and to their right wing dictatorships and their flimsy, oligarchic democracies. If the Panamanians have a saying, that  "cada pueblo tiene el gobierno que merece " (each people has the government it deserves), it applies to some of those Venezuelans today who stomp and who cry, as they witness the dislocations at PEDEVESA and elsewhere, engineered by the Bolivarian leader.       My friend Nadia Buchai, whose Ukrainian Orthodox Church I am looking forward to attending, tells me that when she was in Venezuela, there often were electrical blackouts. Imagine that: electrical blackouts in an oil rich land! And why? Because, according to Nadia, the rich in Venezuela believed it to be beneath them to pay electricity and water bills. Noblesse disobliged.      Such anecdotes, as well as first hand experience of how wealthy  criollo  whites throughout Latin America treat and refer to "the Indians," do much to explain "Chavismo" to me, by casting Chavez's social programs in a specific social and historical context, itself imprinted in my conscience.      Now, I do not idealize Chavez. He holds the dubious and stupid distinction of being the only world leader to visit Saddam Hussein after the Persian Gulf War. His massive spending, touched off by the high price of oil and responsible for some of the referendum votes in his favor, reminds one of the enormous superprojects embarked upon by Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo (1976-1982), who believed that massive oil deposits discovered off the coast of the state of Campeche, in the Gulf of Mexico, would provide the funds to purchase Mexico's pathway to prosperity.  Once the price of oil declined, Mexico set off an international wave of default on foreign debt that ruined the country and left many destitute, with no choice but to emigrate!!!        Yet Chavez was elected democratically, and now that his election has been reaffirmed, the opposition must respect the results. There should be no emulation of Pedro Carmona's briefly successful 2002 officer's coup.    Both sides need to bring some civility to the table of Venezuelan political dialogue.      President Bush should cooperate with Chavez. Venezuela sends us 1.5 million barrels of oil daily.     The two are at opposite ideological poles, and the Bush Administration has traditionally taken a haughty attitude toward Latin governments that are not pliant (I'm thinking of the record of former Bush adviser Otto Reich, as well as of statements made by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, who told the Brazilians that they could trade with Antarctica if they did not support the FTAA). Statements made by Ari Fleischer during the unfolding of the Carmona coup, which intimated (and was widely interpreted as intimating) support for the coup plotters, damaged Bush's credibility in Venezuela and the surrounding region.

       Over the weekend, a cold front blew in from Canada, and that means that it was about 87 degrees with no humidity over here, which is exceedingly rare for Houston in August.       I spent part of the weekend working for congressional candidates, to whom I shall give a brief introduction. Mike Fjetland is an independent running against Majority Whip Tom DeLay in Congressional District 22, and his website is  urlLink http://www.fffe.us . John Martinez is a Democrat running against Rep. John Culberson, DeLay's protege, in Congressional District 7, one of the most conservative districts in the country and the seat formerly held by Bill Archer, once chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and, before Archer, by none other than George Bush I  (c'est √† dire, par ce premier grand et illustre souverain! ). John's website is at  urlLink http://www.martinez-district7.com/ . I also held a sign up for John Dougherty, who is running for state representative in a district currently held by Martha Wong. See  urlLink http://www.jimfortexas.com/ .       I'm happy to help Mike and both Johns because they are good people who are making honest runs against entrenched candidates. Their opponents (I'm thinking of DeLay and Culberson) are among the worst and most avaricious politicians. Tom DeLay, the architect of the mid-decade Texas redistricting and the most effective opponent of public transportation in America today, is particularly intolerant and closeminded. I can recall how, a few years ago on the House floor, he punched a Democratic member with whom he had had a disagreement over policy.       Indeed, when Mike and I went blockwalking yesterday to pass out flyers, you could sense that, despite his overwhelming victories, DeLay's arrogance is nevertheless resented. One man called to us after we had placed a flyer on his front door, and yelled: "You have my vote! I'm not voting for Tom DeLay!" He was an upper middle class white man with graying hair, in a residential subdivision where I've met quite a few oil industry workers (people who, according to the demographers, elect DeLay). He wanted a word with us. He wanted to say NO MORE DELAY.       Talking to that man -- and getting honked at or "thumbs-upped" by passing motorists (one of whom, named Ted, even got out of his car to chat and learn more about Martinez) when you are holding up a political sign and you begin dancing with it to grab people's attention, right by the intersection of Richmond and Mandell -- makes you realize the importance of putting yourself out and running for office.       Consider this:       We live in a world in which we are automatically isolated from other people, aside from our friends; we move about our cities in routine patterns in cars or in buses, which are bubbles and security cordons in which we ensconce ourselves physically and mentally. In Houston especially, people rarely walk the streets just for the sake of it (they let the heat and the city's expanse win the war). My neighborhood can seem like an uninhabitated ghost town. People don't know how much there is to visit in their own city: the Mexican restaurants on Murphy Road south of Beltway 8, the enormous China town on Bellaire, Hermann Park, the Arab and Indian communities on Hillcroft . . . .      That is why, in my estimation, the writer and the politician, maligned though both may be, at times, for reasons that can be sound (some might say that the former is effete and the latter is corrupt), are unique and important catalysts for our time, who, when sincere, breach the anonymity of modernity and post-modernity. I have to get out on the street, and do something like juggle political signs, for the same reason that I have to go to Panama: the alternative is boredom and a prison of my own making, the prison of routine and sediment, calmly settling down.

       Praying to Lord Jesus for a safe return home, in the morning in Panama City, still within the territory of the Republic, I asked why I had come to Panama and returned in my mind to the Big Bend ten years earlier, to the wilderness and to visions of the Mexican border. Panama is beautiful and it is drab, all at the same time, a blending of jungle, Bank Boston and the Banco do Brasil, colonial neighborhoods, slums that supported Noriega, mulatto girls and the Canal.       I was ready to leave and I left. My   transformation began in the sky, over the Caribbean. Upon landing, again Panama the country had been replaced by Panama the myth, imaginary like Veracruz or Havana. Fecund Panama, with its malaria and its yellow fever, a French graveyard: the customs agent was surprised that I had gone there alone. He asked me what I was doing there and how I got the money. ("What do I do for a living?") But I actually wanted him to search my bags this time, and to see the new guayabera, and the molas and the maps of the Canal, evidence of another land that does not exist, in a very real sense, on this earth. You know I created Panama in my mind.  "Verdes mares bravias de minha terra natal, onde canta a jandaia nas frondes da carna√∫ba,"  writes the Brazilian poet Alencar.  "Verdes mares, que brilhais como l√≠quida esmeralda aos raios do sol nascente, perlongando as alvas praias ensombradas de coqueiros."         I wanted the customs agent to search everything. Latin America is vast. I have not found its heart, although I am now convinced that it is hidden in Bolivia, in the most remote hamlet of the most indigenous, secessionist province. (After all, remember that Balboa was the explorer who first thought of El Dorado. Later came Voltaire and then Vicente Huidobro, who knew that the key to entry is the airplane.)       I have entered and returned through one of the mysterious doors of the international terminal of our airport, such as are delineated "Port of Spain" or "San Salvador", and through which entire worlds open (like the hallucinations of a Mayan noble, induced by bloodletting of the tongue) after a matter of hours in the blue sky, in the mere difference between morning over the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American afternoon. Panama is not different from its point of origin; it, too, is an international zone like Terminal E at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). When you're there in the netherworld, you know it. At Miraflores Locks one afternoon, I perceived it -- the yield of the conquest of the Chagres and Finlay's taming of malaria -- in the modern specter of unknown mariners, loafing on the deck of a Swiss container ship while their captain waved at us. The Swiss were followed by a freighter with Taiwanese markings. Each was descending to the Pacific and to Asia, in the direction opposite that of Spanish galleons leaving for Spain from Nombre de Dios, yet to the real land of Columbus, the entrance to which is marked with fanfare and melodrama by a final gate, not a lock, the Bridge of the Americas.

       I go through so many different feelings when I travel to a place in Latin America alone.  I specify Latin America, because I have not gone anyplace else without other people.  Right now, although I could have written the following on other nights, in Mexico or in Panama City, it is night and I am in David, the capital of Chiriqui Province, in southwestern Panama.  I¬¥ve only seen one other American here.  This isn¬¥t a tourist city.  It isn¬¥t even a pretty city, to be honest, although Boquete and the regions north of here are said to be extraordinary, with verdant coffee and citrus plantations, like heaven in the form of agriculture and cool air.  (I¬¥ve seen similar in Costa Rica.)    But I stayed in David because I played it safe: tomorrow I must catch the bus back to Panama City.  I go through so many different emotions.  Sometimes, as in the Bocas del Toro yesterday, on a power boat through the islands, in the middle of the tropics, I was struck by a kind of euphoria, as if I had reached some kind of Shangri-La, because of the wilderness.  It makes my heart leap to be there, it makes me want to lose myself! (to imagine the paraphrased reaction of an English or German Romantic.)  But then a gritty city like David -- it really cuts me down to size.  It can say: you are nothing.  You are insignificant in this enormous world, which is oblivious to you.  So often, money is what buys a smile, and you really feel it here; if you don¬¥t have money, you¬¥re nothing.  And if I protest that now, I hypocritically ignore the beggars, who haunt the streets of Latin America and the conscience.      Sometimes, I do not see myself spending much more time in Latin America, whatever the term means.  (I still think it¬¥s a useful term, and I could expostulate on why.)  I do not recognize myself in the return glances of the people, or in the central plazas, gritty and worn reflections of their ideal selves, and in the poverty and the dirt, which makes itself felt in David and in Panama City.  Latin America is a difficult place.  Particularly for the outsider.  Then again, no place is easy for the person who approaches it alone.         Is mine one of many ¬®"Latin American" realities?  Is it a definitive reality, naked?  Or, am I seeing too much too darkly?  What is the Christian way of seeing Latin America, what is right and what is socially just?  What is the answer for these people, for the Panamanians, who have just elected Martin Torrijos, the son of a populist dictator, to be their new president?  The newspapers speak of a Latin loss of confidence in representative government.      And I say to myself somethimes, perhaps wrongly, or because it is a weak moment spent alone, that I should go someplace else, farther away from the Gulf of Mexico that laps up against Houston, to Asia.  Or, that I should not go anywhere, but just stay in Texas for now and get down to work.  I have a law career to develop.   Latin America cannot be idealized.  In most cases, it should not be.  It must be accepted at face value.

       As reported today in the New York Times at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/international/middleeast/05syria.html?hp , Chaldean, Assyrian, and other minority Christian sects in Iraq are currently confronting ramped up incidents of persecution, kidnappings, and church desecration by Islamist fundamentalists. Coupled with reports of massive, government-organized protests in Khartoum, Sudan against the prospect of American intervention in Darfour (see  urlLink http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_articleweb/1,13-0,36-374543,0.html ), this headline does not paint an agreeable picture of religious and ethnic tolerance in the Arab world.       Also very troubling, and the subject of an editorial in yesterday¬¥s New York Times available at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/opinion/04wed1.html , is the chilling and undeniable fact that Iran¬¥s theocratic leadership appears to be actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program.  Diplomatic attempts by Britain, Germany, and France (whose previous foreign minister and current interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, confidently proclaimed that his approach to the Iranian question was a saner and more effective model than Bush¬¥s Iraq policy) have consistently been frustrated by the ruling clerics. They are fully aware that near-universal condemnation of the war in Iraq has greatly, if not completely, reduced the probability of any ultimate and decisive -- and by that, I mean military -- action being taken against them.         Why are so many individuals who were extraordinarily vocal in their defense of the Iraqi people, and in their condemnation of the American intervention, now ghastly silent -- not agape! -- in the face of the outrages being committed against Iraqi Christians and Sudanese?  Does the prospect of a nuclear Iran not frighten them?         I have a theory about the double standard:      It is out of ignorance, apathy, ideology, or conscious design, that people around the world turn a blind eye to much troubling news from the Middle East. To some, "Bush¬¥s" war is the crux of our terrorist problem, the catalyst for fundamentalism, the grave, imperialist injustice  par excellence .  We are talking about the kind of people who, in the 1980¬¥s, from the comfort of their Western Europeans salons, howled against the Reagan deployment of missiles in West Germany. Resentment of the United States, envy, and literary idealizations of socialism, were allowed to cloud over and obfuscate the harsh realities of life behind the Iron Curtain. Think of all the French intellectuals who, until the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and, in a few cases, even after it, towed the Moscow line.      We cannot allow a similar development -- the furtherance of the ridiculous notion (propogated by people who really should know better, like the excellent, Nobel-Prize winning Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whom I once had the pleasure of meeting, and who later called George W. Bush the greatest threat to world peace today) that mistakes made by President Bush and crimes committed by Islamic fundamentalists, Saddam Hussein, or Omar el-Bashir are all morally equivalent -- to take root and PARALYZE US. Yes, I am sounding the alarm!      We have to clearly address the threats to religous freedom and human rights, as well as the abuses perpetrated by radical fundamentalist governments in the Middle East (this doesn¬¥t meant that the answers are always, or even predominantly, military). And, while there is a pressing need for an equitable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along the lines of the peace attempted by Presidents Carter and Clinton, we cannot permit this quagmire to distract from and foil, discussions of other problems in neighboring countries.

       The American on the airplane had been to Colombia, to nearby Cartagena and Baranquilla.  He had shrugged off the danger and kept a low profile, and everything was lovely: the country, the people, and their most perfect Castilian Spanish.  "As long as you do not act like an asshole, flaunting a Rolex and snapping pictures every which way, you should be OK," the man assured Jim.  ¬®But the kidnappings are the real deal."  Thousands of Colombians are still accounted for; many are taken to the wilderness of the Darien, on the Panama-Colombia border.      Santafe de Bogota, holy, sainted faith, what do you hide in the Andes?  We must go there.

        The following is a rough draft of part of a short story that I am currently writing about Panama:       What does it mean to be a Panamanian, Jim wondered aloud, to nobody in particular, except perhaps those who were milling around him at the end of the Panamanian workday on one of the city¬¥s main avenues, the Via Espana?  Panama does not feel like a country in Central America.   To Jim, Panama did not evoke images of ¬®Indians¬® in Guatemala or Honduras.   Panama City might not be the Paris of Latin America, but it has its elegance and its place in the world.  It seemed distinct from what Jim imagined a Tegucigalpa being like: dull, morose, mud brown, and deforested.  People here love guayaberas and have the salt and pepper hair of mulattos.  A bit like in Cuba?       "Everywhere there are Colombians, escaping the ravages of an interminable guerrilla war in their country, which ultimately has reached the most cynical proportions.  The FARC no longer fight in the name of a Marxist revolution, just cocaine.  The paramilitaries terrorize and butcher.¬®"  Yesterday, in the Panamanian newspaper, Jim read that the Colombian President, Alvaro Uribe, had been named a decade ago in a secret U.S. Department of Defense intelligence paper as a close ally of Pablo Escobar¬¥s Medellin cartel.  "But Uribe is a hardliner.  They won¬¥t suspend his visa like they did Ernesto Samper¬¥s."      What does it mean to be Panamanian?  A man (or woman) of the isthmus?      Jim bought a guayabera to find out.  He could have also purchased a flag: of stars and bars arranged diagonally, with red and blue colors.  He talked with people in restaurants and taxi drivers.  Most seemed to tell him that Mireya Moscoso, the current president of the Republic, will not be missed because she has mismanaged the country.  There were allegations of corruption.      "The lesson is....don¬¥t elect a woman!" laughed a Panamanian businessman of Chinese origin at a swanky restaurant.  He was joking and having a beer with a young visitor from Miami, of Nicaraguan extraction.      Many looked to the forthcoming inauguration of Martin Torrijos, son of the famous strongman Omar Torrijos, who died in an airplane crash under suspicious circumstances and was succeeded by Manuel Antonio Noriega, with some measure of satisfaction.  But it was the satisfaction or resignation of poor people, who expect little from a Latin American government:      "You have to have the right last name to get one of these jobs,¬® Norberto, a taxi driver, explained as he contemplated the Canal workers at the touristed Miraflores Locks.  ¬®A last name like Arias.¬®  (Arias, as in Arnulfo Arias, the fascistic leader who allied Panama with Nazi Germany during World War II.  Arias the strong man, the President of the United Fruit Company Republic, whose name reminds me of a similarly titled poem by Pablo Neruda in his Canto General.)  The jobs at the Canal are coveted because the wages in the Zone cannot be lowered, by stipulation of the treaty signed by Jimmy Carter (whom Jim admired greatly) and Torrijos.   But you¬¥ve got to have connections!    ¬®My last name is Guerrero.¬®         ¬®The Americans were not saints.  They did things that were bad.  They would find young women at bars, who would look into their blue eyes and say that ¬¥this man is the object of my destiny¬¥, and fuck them, and then leave them by the side of the road.  But every Panamanian misses the Americans now that they are gone.  They taught us to work hard, and in exchange they paid you well, so that you always had money in your pocket and ate well."

       That on this website I post under the pen name of JUAN de FUCA, itself the assumed name of the Greek explorer Apostolos Valerianos, whom the Greeks still lionize today (see, for example, the information provided by the Greek consulate in Vancouver at urlLink http://www.vancouver.grconsulate.ca/english/pioneers/index.cfm?Directory=Pioneers&amp;Page=4 ), makes it only fit that on this Tuesday I write in triumph from this the country of another famed explorer, the discover of the Sea of the South and servant of the Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V, VASCO NU√ëEZ de BALBOA. Greetings to all of you from Panama, land of the Isthmus and the Canal.       Panama is distinct from other Latin American countries that I have visited, including what many call the ¬®Switzerland of Latin America,¬® Costa Rica. The imprint of America¬¥s long presence here lingers unmistakeably, particularly in the recently abandoned military bases near the Canal and in the nation¬¥s currency, which is merely the dollar popularly renamed the BALBOA. The Canal itself is a testament to the ingenuity of French and American engineers, and a tribute to the hard work of Panamanians and immigrants from Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and Martinique. Indeed, it is a site to behold! Yesterday, I visited the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks, and saw the enormous container ships, all built so as not to exceed the PANAMAX width specifications, slowly be raised or lowered, to either the levels of Lago Gatun or of the Pacific Ocean. I had dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Miraflores Locks.      Panama is surely a twilight zone, a way station that barely divides the waters. For a span of 80 kilometers, enormous ships that normally have the run of the oceans must squeeze slowly through humid jungle and the narrow Culebra Cut. The toll, assessed on a per ton basis, normally exceeds $30,000.
