						   In my last post I was talking about how to start a business online. Today I'm going to write a post about how to market and promote your website. Internet marketing is all about getting people to see what you have to offer. The biggest key to success in online business is volume of traffic. To get a large volume of traffic to your web business you will need to do alot of research on different search engine terms and keywords then get your site optimized to bring in the customers. The  urlLink Internet Marketing Bootcamp ebook  is an in depth guide on how to get going and where to start. It includes many tools and sites to go to get the help you need to pick the proper keywords for your site.   I have been finding that when marketing a site there is many things that you can do to finding successful keywords. Asking other poeple you know to give you an idea of what they were looking for when searching for what it is you offer can be the key to your success. I say that it could be the key to your success because your friends and family have different opinions on what they would type in to find what you were offering than just yourself alone. The more people you can ask the bigger of idea for search tearms you can get. Having alot of search terms when using pay per clicks is a good idea but really you need at least 10 good search words that are very targeted to your business. Paying for clicks sounds like a new concept for most people and it does involve some risk. With targeted keywords and careful management you can get a large volume of customers to your site. The best place to get started with keyword research and internet marketing is  urlLink Internet Marketing Bootcamp ebook.   Thank you for reading. PCS President

						   Hello Everyone:  Today I'm going to be making a post how to of starting a business online. When you first decide to try to make money online there is many obstacles and barriers to get around. These barriers of entry are what keep many people from getting into business for themselves.   The biggest and most difficult barrier to get through is start-up capital. Most people do not have the means to start a conventional business as there is alot of factors that cost alot of money. The internet offers a new playing field in which to get started with. Online work and making money online provides freedom to run your business without the overhead of a conventional business. Knowing how to use your money wisely is a skill that you must master. To learn more about using money wisely I suggest you read  urlLink The Internet Marketing Bootcamp.  The largest mistake that people make when trying to overcome this boundry is the expectation that they will make money from day one. All business in one form or another is about investing. People often wonder where will I get the money? The answer is anywhere you can get  it. Business is about investing. Investing small amounts of money then investing alot your time you can become successful pretty quickly but it still takes time. If you ask yourself "what if I don't make it?" This attitude will prevent you from overcoming the boundries and prevent you from even trying.  The second largest barrier is the fear of the unkown. People usually try to take the "safe" route when it comes to financial security. The stress of not having anything happen when you put out thousands of dollars is stressful. If you keep trying and adjusting your strategy you will be able to overcome any boundry in your way. The ebook  urlLink The Internet Marketing Bootcamp  is a great read for helping you with all issues related to starting to work online.   Thank you for taking the time to read. PCS President
