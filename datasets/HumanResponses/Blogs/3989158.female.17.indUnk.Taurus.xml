THANKS AUNTIES!    then i went home and wrote all these crap in my blog... now the weather is so hot and humid... haiz... guess i would be taking&nbsp;a bath and probably going to do my POA homework which i didn't touch... life sucks so much with projects that there is no time for studying and social life not to mention love life... maybe poly wasn't the right choice after all...

         man i got up at 9 today even though i vomitted last night cos i felt so sick... it was all thanks to WCOM!! i will never forget you... ok so today I wanted to finish up my stupid WCOM project because today is the dateline haha… in the end I only reached school at 1.30 because I went to popular to buy some construction paper for the project… only 10 pieces costs me 3.00… wow, no wonder popular is so rich… anyway the project was finished at 4.50 then after binding it was exactly 5pm… haha, just on time…    Then I quarrelled with gary and I really don’t know what’s his problem… he always scold me… I jus told him to keep quiet when he reminded us it was 4.50pm… anyway it is not really his problem cos we already knew and it truly irritated everyone… so after that we kind of quarrelled inside the lift… I hate it a lot cos I don’t see it as my fault… and if he was to say he waited for a long time he did it willingly… I dint force him to do so… in fact i asked him to go home and study first then i'll meet him later... then I asked him to hold my laptop for me… he said I must lift it up for him to hold… wad a bastard… why cant he just take it from me… anyway I dropped it on the floor cos I really don’t have the strength to hold it up for him to carry and he was like gonna hold it u see… then for a while it could not get switched on... im sick u see and it was my left hand anyway… he said I should have lifted it up and he said I was pretending… I am super sad and he just don’t know only… I really begin to wonder if I made the correct decision about 3 years ago… I think he was not like this 3 years ago… maybe he is brginning to get tired of me and so am i… I am getting just so sick and he jus don’t seem to get it… I try so hard to make him happy but it seems so unhappy about it anyway… everything is always my fault… I don’t see why he don’t portray himself in my shoes… then he will understand… I dint even say anything about him being fat and stuff… I think our relationship should end very soon… which is very sad… but there is nothing that I can do about it…    anyway we went to play pool and then i lost really bad... cos i jus couldn't concentrate and we took many cues to finish a table... man, i felt like a loser then... then we had dinner in bukit timah hawker centre... i bought duck mee and the guy was really funny... he asked me "mei mei ni yao chi shen mo" (lil girl wad do u want to eat)... erm... im not exactly young and he's jus in 20s... weird huh... anyway after dinner i went home...    ok... that's it for tonight... i still havent study for common test... man... im so scared i will fail... and i dont know if i have WCOM common test... if u guys know... pls drop me a note here if not email me... if not im not gonna touch that subject cos it is not even staed in Mel and then i think the teachers said that it will be when the school starts in class...

         man... i got up at 10.00 today then i gave tuition at 12.30-2.00pm... it was kind of boring... i taught her area of a sector... volume of sphere... volume of cone=1/3 cylinder... blah blah... haha... my friends said im pro but look at it this way... we took our O's and all these are nothing la... hmmm... ok... so i reached bukit batok at 2.30pm...    man... met jia yong and i dint even see him... omg... i was too engrossed in looking at the yummy pasar malam food haha... then he had to wave in front of my face before i actually responded... malu... erps... ok... so i met those guys (allan, louisa, kercher) at 3...    we took 173 to louisa's house... which is like so special... the lift opens and then her house appears... haha... i like the glass flowers in her living room and her mum cooks really nice food unlike mine's... sob... and her mum is like those considerate mama... so nice man... and i like her air-con... damn shuang... ok enough about her house...    anyway we did alot of crazy things in her house today... ok... there was this silly beetle sleeping at the side of the wall... we ignored it pretty much... until at night about 9pm i realised that it was pretty squashed up and flattened and its intestines were bulging out of its shiny shell... yuckies... so i told louisa she stepped on it and then all of us kept laughing cos the poor beetle looks so screwed and dismantled... lol... then i lifted up my foot and i found part of the beetle on my leg!!! man, we laughed until we roll...    another funny thing was about the interviews... cos we were supposed to pretend that we are our parents and write down their comments on teenage violence... then we allan said that his father was involved in teenage violence last time and then i dont know how it got so out of hand that we gave allan a nickname... cos he said he looked like loan shark... i called him "one man mao(hair in chinese)" cos he got this silly long strand of hair that grew out of his chin and i've been teasing him about it since day one... lol... then i imitate him playing around his silly hair with two fingers!! LOL!!!! man... rocks... we laugh until we nearly died cos i couldn't catch up on my breathe... there are lots of other things too...    anyway the project lasted until about 12.30am the next day liao... and it is lunar 7th month... man... scary... luckily my dad volunteered to fetch me home... bOO!

         i got up really early today at 8.30 and i jus couldn't open my eyes man... i have this boring make up POA lecture... so anyway we found lt24 and it was really boring even though i think i understood wad is it... felt like slapping the lecturer when she kept lamenting on... oh yes, btw, i jus found out that someone in class has been bitching about me... anyway im not pissed cos she is no better... wad a hypocrite... pretends to be nice and behind bitch about so many people... and im not the only one... okies... i jus know i am what i am and i feel proud to be who i am right now... plain jealousy man... anyway she is the same as her friend that used to be my best friend... no need to elaborate further...    ok... so poa lesson crazy ms yong kept calling albert... i knew she likes him since day one haha... hmm then the four of us (me, louisa, van, lan) went to KAP after lesson... man it was so funny over there... anyway we saw the cute guy and he kept looking at me... damn, he must have suspected that i was the one that wanted his number but then again he wasn't so cute after looking at him a few times... ok... hmm... we had mac for lunch and then we were playing this silly game whereby i was the medium... so i put the mac straw into my milo bottle... so i will shake the straw out... if the straw falls on red-bad luck; yellow-good luck; white is neutral... it sounds really childish and lame but what happened was i tried it 5x on allan and it was always RED!! (i cant help laughing out loud now!!) and i got 3x white even though i wanted yellow... fine those other two girls got yellow... u guys know we laughed till the whole KAP looked at us... i laugh until i cant stand up... serious... damn funny the process esp when allan kept getting the red and he like give fucked-up-face... lol!! then we went to the toilet and i took out a white flower from the flower vase... then they say give it to allan and so i did... man then we bluff him that the flowers are real and initially he believed... omg, wad a fool... we laughed man... then we told him not to throw it away or it will be the end of our friendship and in the end he carried around KAP... we were hoping someone will stop him! *evil... muahaha... look at his msn nice "Zer0- my mum said that i am mad if i gonna plant that synthetic flower and claim that it will grow" !!!... and that was what we told him... haha... he said his mum kept luffing... man... rocks!!... ROFLMAO NOW!    anyway we kind of did up most of the stuff for the findings now... we are left with collating and conclusions+recommendations for tomorrow... alrights... gonna have a nice snug nap now... tomorrow still got tuition class to give...

         man today i made a wasted effort to wake up early for BCA cos there is simply no lesson... i only found out on my way to school so i went on to gary's place instead... since i was so tired i decided to skip MAEC lecture as well... haha, so wad i did was to sleep at his place while he game as usual and then i game and he watch+guide me... hmm... i realised that my warcraft is not as good before... sob...    i reached class at 2.15 and there are v lil ppl in class... almost our whole class was late... xinzi and all+louisa+weifeng... haizz... and dear ker cher was sick today due to strenuous training from taekwondo and her dad is overseas for business... poor her... anyway we had really draggy lessons today and guess wad? i dont understand a shit about the topic cos i also pon last week's lecture... i dont know what is wrong with me right now!!    after class something funny happened in the lift... man, roflmao! u see, weifeng was jumping inside the lift and then the lift suddenly stopped... actually this weifeng is really a nice and cute boy and i think he has good leadership qualities+responsibilities and stuff... but i actually said "weifeng u stop this if not i beat your gugu"... and of course i dint mean it... then there was this arkward silence then louisa laughed... it's crazy... thanks to louisa la, cos we always use this kind of language when we converse... man it is so embarrassing... see, it was so funny that we laughed even in van's house... then i nearly died from choking from my saliva... jus imagine myself having a guy to tell me "amanda u stop this if not i slap your breasts"... LOL    then the 5 of us (excluding kercher) went to van's house... as usual, jason went for a while then he left... man... then allan had to leave cos he had to meet his parents to buy a computer... anyway i think allan did an excellent job in finding the books i wanted him to find... then i typed out the interviews the whole day sianz... ok, will update the rest tom... now too tired...    and singapore idol cheered my day up... i think banana man rocks and he looks so nerdy haha...    bus 67 broke down on my way home haha... with louisa... man so funny... got one stupid NS truck bumped on the boot of the bus and then the driver got down... i think we stopped there for like 15 min man and i was like pointing my fingers at the NS ppl giving them the uh-oh look haha... and then they gave some apologetic look... i hope they get to stay in for a month as a punishment... haha, made me go home later by 15 min... man... anyway me and louisa kept laughing... there was this mad man behind me making funny noises and we kept laughing... esp when i imitated him... we also dont know why we are laughing but i guess with both of us, our laughters are infectious... hmm, then i had to pass by the scary railway tracks but i guess i wasn't scared after all... i slept after louisa got off the bus...

WHEW! anyway i ran to pick it up and then for the rest of the journey it occurred frequently... wondered why... as if i was in harry potter land and there was some  expellimus  spell said... lame... i heard a few giggles behind me though... damn... haha... u can juz imagine me in brown singlet, jeans and a big red riding hood kind of bag and really slippery slippers trying to maintain my balance... hmmm... after the ever-so-complicated POA lesson we went to NP Alumni to eat...  the place is nice as usual and i drank soda strawberry... dont drink that, soda kiwi's better... anyway i had chicken teriyaki for lunch and it was good... played lots of red hot chili peppers there like what im doing now... i think im in love with them, those blessed guys... haha  WCOM lecture was cancelled cos Thea Goh wasn't here... rocks! we went to NP Co-op and i bought 8 packets of seaweed and ate them all... yummy... now u know seaweed is my fave tibit... only $2.30 and even NUTC sells it for $5.60... im fanatic for seaweed... chew chew chew...  then we had POA tutorial and i dint do homework for the first time... haha... and i slept throughout half the class... too tired u see... and neither she nor anybody realised until we had to flip to a certain page but i dint... then she went over to see and realised im sleeping... haha... now u guys know why sleeping is my hobby... i sat in such a way that i looked like im facing up looking at the OHP with my chin lying on my hands... but in reality im in dreamland dreaming away happily... LOL... funny ya... when ker cher told me what happened we laughed... anyway she is nice cos she dint wake me up from sleep... something else funny happened in POA class too...  it was really freezing in class and i had to put on my BUM jacket... so i reached my hands inside my pocket to keep warm... then i felt something hard and coarse... naturally i took it out... ROFLMAO!! IT WAS THIS GLITTERY LOOKING STONE!! GOD KNOWS WHERE IT CAME FROM!!! and i told ker cher is this a "BAO SHI" aka precious stones of some sort and we laughed like hell... man... the three (Louisa, KC, Me) of us went mad cos it is fucking lame... then Ker Cher threw it into the rubbish bin... after class i went to find gary in library...  stayed with gary until 5 then we went off for pool... we played till 7 and i was really on form today cleared in 2 cues on a average... yeps... i beat gary in all the games except for two, one which i shot in black ball in wrong pocket and the other he did it himself... surprising ya? hmmm... then i went for seafood dinner again...  i had black pepper crayfish and sambal stingray for dinner in bukit timah hawker centre... want the food gourmet to describe the food again? haha... so here goes... the crayfish was actually deep fried so it gave off a nice orange-brown colour on the outside... if you will juz bother to chew on the shell, that is if u know how to appreciate, it gives off a very nice seafood fragrance... the delicious tasting white meat was also firm and slighty chewy and it is fresh because it doesn't stick to it's shell... rocks! the black peppers sauce was prepared using moderately grounded black pepper with a nice blend of garlic and onions... a thin layer of oil lies on top of the sauce which is supposed to keep in the heat... so even as we took our time to eat, the food still tasted good haha... anyway the taste is quite heavenly... hard to describe... we had four crayfish each... yummy... and maybe a brief description of the stingray... it is also nice cos the edges are deep-fried to a crisp state such that even the bones can be chomped on and swallowed without any problems... the sambal chilli is hot yet not overly done so it doesn't really burn your buds so we can savour both the flavour of the stingray and the chilli... hey cooks, well done! thanks ya... and i had some sugarcane that tasted so much like syrups to drink... hehe...  yeps... when i reached home i was so full and decided to take a dump... haah, i bombed Hagasaki man... look this is gonna sound really gross... jus skip to the next point if u wanna... anyway i shitted alot of it filled up quite a bit of my toilet bowl... and i really ate alot these few days u see... hmmm... ya so i had to take 3 full flushes to get rid of everything man... lol... and of cos some water from the tap too... sick ya... haha... but it is a good riddance of waste matter man...  anyway it is getting really late and i haven prepare for the WCOM test tom yet... shit ya? haha... ok gtg bathe and read up... ciaos... tonight so cold jus remember to pull your blankets ya... good night...
