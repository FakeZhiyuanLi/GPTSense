      Do you and your siblings fight? Do you get temper tantrums when your little brother uses your hair dryer for a creepy project without asking? Or do you get mad when your older sister talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, and blah blah blahs on the phone for hours? Maybe you fight over who gets to play on the computer first, or who has to do garbage this week. Tell us what you and your siblings fight about most often. Who knows? Maybe we'll put you on our web site! Just tell us in the comment section. Thanks!   By: Annmarie

      I told you that I would publish some people on my website, so I am! I finally got some comments to publish, so here are some of my visitors ideas of the  Best Pet Ever!    Ana Alsobrooks said: "I think the best pet ever is a bird because they make sweet tunes in the morning and you can teach them to talk and recite different melodies! Once you get one the more you give them the more love they'll give you back!  Nicole Wright thinks her hamster is the best pet ever!   I still think my guinea pig is the best pet for me, but keep sending you comments in!

      This is such a great CD! It is a little more mature sounding than Sk8ter Boy, and has some really powerful lyrics. My favorite track is Don't Tell Me. I give it 4 stars and two thumbs up!  P.S. To hear her new CD online, please visit: www.avril-lavigne.com

      I love this move! I saw it 6 days before it came out. (I won a contest) I would suggest you see it! It has comedy, adventure, and romance all in one movie! I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up!  P.S. Around the World in 80 Days comes out June 16th, but I won a radio contest and saw it 6 days early. I would really suggest you see it, because it's the best movie of the year!

      I think the guinea pig is the best pet! They are cuddly, they make cute noises, and love to be held. Please leave your comments on what the Best Pet Ever is. I may choose to publish your comment on my website, so please send you comments!

      This is a great website! I love it! Please visit it and check out the cool cartoons, e-cards, polls, and many other things! I give it 4 and a half stars and two thumbs up!  P.S. This is NOT my website! I just was browsing and saw it. Not many people have visited it, so I thought I'd do some free advertising. It is really cool!

      I like this game a lot. I love to ride See-doos up at our cottage. My parents never trust me to drive a See-doo, so this is almost as good. It isn't the type of game that I could play for hours and not get bored, though. I'll give it 3 stars and one thumbs up.

      I loved this movie! It was a little bit more scary than the other movies in the series, but I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie! The dementors were really eerie, but sooooo cool! I give it 5 stars and two thumbs up!

      I have a guinea pig named Buttons. Guinea pigs are the best pets ever! They whistle and squeak. They love to be held. They are so soft and cuddly. I love my guinea pig, and I would suggest a guinea pig as a pet to anyone!

      I just got a new guinea pig. It is an Abyssinian, which means it has messy hair. She is black with some brown spots. I named her Buttons. She will sit on my lap for hours! I love her! If you want to buy a guinea pig, you can buy them at a Mejers store near you!   P.S. I will be adding lots more stories about my guinea pig!

      Learn to play the guitar! Firstly you'll need a guitar. (duh!) I've seen them for as little as $5 on eBay. Then search for free electronic guitar lessons on a search engine. Before long you will be playing like a pro!   P.S. No guarantees!

      I got home from my grandma's house, and had a really bad headache. I got a tub and threw-up in that. Then I slept for three hours! I feel so sick. My dad made steak but I can't have a lot or it will upset my tummy. Well, I'll write more soon!

      Hello again! I am typing this at my grandma's house. In about 1 hour the firework show will start. My cousin Jenny has just done a dance recital. She is very good. She said hi to anyone who is reading this right now. My little brother Clayton is being funny. He also says hi. I may be boring you, but nothing else happens around here. The only thing is that my Uncle Jim, (Jenny's Dad) looks a lot like a gorilla! (Ha ha ha!) The seconds are like hours as we wait for the fireworks to start. I will write about the show. My Grandma says hi. So, bye for now, and please tell others about my site. Also, please post your comments. Thanks a lot, and have a great night!

      I have been either on the computer or playing with my guinea pig for the past week! My guinea pig is black and brown. Her name is Buttons. Today she bit me! I scolded her and put her in her cage. I have to go to my grandma's house for a sleepover. She is pretty cool. It will just be me, my brother Clayton, and my cousin Jenny. We usually get to look at the pet shop. Tonight at Grandma's we might see the Cutlerville fireworks show from her driveway. Last year we were so close I could see where they were launching them! It was too cool! I hope I am not boring you with my life, but it is all that has happened lately. I hope something exciting will happen soon! Well, I guess I'll stop typing and go to my Grandma's house.

      Hello! I am sorry I haven't written in a while, but I have been sooooooooooo busy! I went to camp for a whole week! It's called CAMP BEECHWOOD HILLS. I loved it! It's a fun Christian camp. I feel so much closer to God. There was even a shaving cream fight! The only bad thing that happened was that our cabin flooded. Outside the water was up to our knees! All in all, it was really fun. I had the nicest consulers, Their names are Heather and Missy. I am so happy my parents can afford to send me to camp. Well, I don't have much more to say, but I'll write more soon.  BYE!
