      Hey wuts up?? today i woke up at about 12....got to sleep in haha..just did some work around the house for most of the day and talked on the phone with poodle..around 5:30 my 10 year old sister and her friend Kelsey who just moved in down the street, came over. They brought Lauren, Kelseys 4 year old sister. Im gonna be babysitting Lauren next wednesday morning.. that girls so cute me and Lauren watched full house while kels and my sister hung out until 6. Then i went to vbs with lin and kels. Lauren wanted to come too but wed have to get her car seat and stuff and her mom said maybe enough time when we had more time to get it all in..so i told herr she can come over whenever im home and i will hang out with her. lol..well vacation bible school was uhh interesting lol...lots of hard work ill just say..ud think working with the 2's and 3's would be easy not when it takes like 4 adults in there along iwth like 7 kids just to keep them under control..there fun tho.. they just get out every little thing possible. it was cute tho cuz all the kids were trying to help clean up today tho when it was over. we got to make pciture frames haha. Then when i got home i talked to amanda on the phone for TWO HOURS  until about 11 or 11:30..lol that was fun we just talked about who shes inviting to her 16th birthday..then i called emily and told her an interesting story about vbs..and that was my day, Now i just finished working on my webshots picture thing and getting ready to work on my buddy profile well imma go!!!

      hey wuts up? so far today wut ive done..i woke up at 8 went to sunday school at 9. Wow there were these two guys (twins) in my sunday school class today that were really cute i hadnt seen them before but josh linc said there gonna be sophomores but that all they were doing was playing the guitars for the week to fill in for Mark Westman (our pastor, who also plays the guitar on sundays at our church lol)..BY THE WAY EMILY WESTMAN I MISS YOU BUT I HOPE YOUR HAVING FUN IN CHICAGO!!! then after sunday school we had service and after service i stayed for a little and helped set some stuff up for vacation bible school which starts tomororw night. So that was fun .....but then after that was all done my mom came and got me & my sister &amp; we went with our parents to go to my grandparents for lunch and to stay there for a couple hours. It was nice to see them & all but it was pretty boring cuz after lunch they just stayed out side the whole time talking to my parents. So me and lindsey basically just watched tv, played with my moms cell phone. After a while i called crystal though..talked to her for a little bit then hung up with her cuz we were leaving..then in the car i called her again and talked to her until i got home...okay so wut do you think..would you rather listen to the beatles??(and other oldies)  or kenny chesney (&amp; other country) i say kenny and others but crystal is all for the beatles and oldies lol so tell me wut ya think!!! BUt i dont know what im doing tonight if crystals parents come home she MIGHT stay over here or i MIGHT stay over there but who knows...........well thats it for now..leave me some comments!!! ~*Bre*~
