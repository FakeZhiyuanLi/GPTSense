       (singing) I love Lucy, but she's not me....     Ok, so while there's a few things we have in common,  here's the differences:  My name's not Lucy.      My husband isn't Cuban (although I think he's hot anyway, and he does play an instrument, so that oughta count for something, right?)   I have 3 kids.   I've never even  been  to NYC.  I've never worn a loving cup on my head.      So why the name?    I love Lucy. Even though by the time I knew about her she was already divorced from Ricky and doing things like "Lucy" on tv. But I've always felt some affinity for the goofy redhead who got herself into a bazillion crazy situations. Probably because I manage to do a lot of that myself. :) So, when it came time to name my blog, this just worked.  Oh, that and I do have red hair from a box. ;)        Why a blog?                Boredom, maybe? Possibly. Actually, I saw a blog by someone else I sort of know from another website, and thought it looked like fun. I love to write and used to keep stacks of journals as a kid, and since I spend more time on the computer than with my journal lately, this seems like a good way to combine the two.          Tell us about the Ricardos....           Me -  As far as who I am....well, I'm a 33 (yipes) year old married woman. I have red hair and am a SAHM. I have 3 kids (2 daughters and a son) and my dh, Ricky (not his real name of course) and I have been married 14 years next month. We live in a 2 story house in a podunk town without even one real stoplight. (Not kidding!)  I love to scrapbook and take pictures as well as lots of other stuff. I'd love to take pictures on a professional basis, but don't know if I'll ever actually do it. The kind of stuff I really like to take pictures of, I don't see a lot of demand for. Nobody says, "Gee, I think I should hire a photographer to take a picture of that brick wall for me." I don't mind photographing people....I just prefer to take pictures of stuff that doesn't talk back. If I want that, I can photograph my kids! LOL   Ricky -   Again, not his real name, but I figure I only signed up here to embarass me, not him too. :) He's also 33, and just changed careers a year ago after having been a mailman for 10 years. Talk about a life-change. He's too creative to be stuck delivering people's water bills for the rest of his life. He now sells real estate and on the side sings in a band and plays guitar. Hey look...something in common with Ricky! He's the absolute love of my life and even though his new job seems to have made a cell phone permanently affix itself to his ear, I'm so glad that he's made the change in jobs - this one suits him so much better.   The Little Rickys -   We've got 3. None of them are JR's, either. Our oldest daughter, S. is 13. Teenagers - yipes. I'm not old enough to have one, and yet I nearly have 2. Pass the Miss Clairol, please, I think I see a few more grey hairs. ;) S has been going on about 25 since she was oh, 7. I'm ready beyond belief for the moodiness to stop. One cranky, PMS'y person in this house at a time is enough, thank you very much! LOL  A. is the middle one, and our only boy. He makes me tired just watching him. Where do they get that energy?? I swear the boy runs on high all the time. He's a good kid, though and sometimes way too smart for his own good.  K is the baby, although if you call her that, she'll roll those eyes of hers at you before you have a chance to take a breath. Where S is all tomboy, K is all girly girl. I love having one of each. I was more of a tomboy, but love playing with the girly stuff, too. It's also very true that the last child is the easiest. VERY true.  We also have a psycho-cat. Not quite as noisy as Little Ricky's puppy, but psycho just the same. We only got her a few days ago, but already she's fitting right in. So far nobody's called to complain about her barking all the time. ;)          Tune in Next Time....          Anyway...that's it for now. I'll try to find something more exciting to post about next time. I've probably bored you comatose already. Sorry about that...hey, there's a little drool on your keyboard. My blogs come with no guarantees, ok?
