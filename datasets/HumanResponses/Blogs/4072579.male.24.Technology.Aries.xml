       Anyone out there thinking about getting a tattoo, or just got a tattoo should definitely pick up a can of  urlLink this stuff .&nbsp; This is the second tattoo that I've used it on and its probably the best healer out there.&nbsp; It is pricey, but worth the price.&nbsp; Not only does it heal quickly, it also has a very pleasant aroma, I've been told its the rosemary and the lavender extracts that it has in it.     &nbsp;   On a side note, I have actually been offered a decent sum of money to eat an entire can of tattoo goo.&nbsp; This was brought on by me talking about how good it smelled and I blurted out something like, I would probably eat it if I didnt need it.&nbsp; I think I might do it, all the ingredients are non-toxic so I dont think it would kill me.     &nbsp;

						   As my wife lays on the couch watching her 8 millionth episode of CSI, I can't help but think, where in the hell is there a Crime Scene Investigation department with that many good looking people working in it?&nbsp; I mean c'mon, I have'nt seen one bad looking person including the person who was accidentally killed by a dumpster in the middle of a thunderstorm in an alleyway in Williamstown, WV.  While we're on this topic, lets talk about one of the best shows on television right now.&nbsp; Las Vegas.&nbsp; There is nothing like a sweet show full of hot lead actresses who are all D cup, where the object is to see who can wear the shirt that reveals the most cleavage.&nbsp; The most awesome thing is that there are&nbsp;seven beautiful employees and one balding employer.  I want to see an episode of CSI: Reality where the lead investigator has a beer gut like mine and smokes like a train.&nbsp; Then when he's on his way back to the station he pulls over some low life, beats the shit out of him and takes his money.&nbsp; The victim blurts out something like 'I'll sue your ass' at which point Frank (Frank would be his real name, not Joseph or Paul or something like that) would remind him that he picked him up for selling crack to an elementary school kid last year that that has pictures of the whole thing.&nbsp; That show would get good ratings.

						   first of all, i've had this problem lately where i always wake up at 5am on the button.  i have no idea why and it really pisses me off because i usually cant get back to sleep.  well today i did get back to sleep and i had this dream that i swear was real, at least it felt real.  it was either thanksgiving or christmas or one of the holidays when the whole family is in town to celebrate.  and i woke up (in my dream) and my eye was all fucked up and almost swollen shut.  i looked in the mirror and it looked like i had a smaller eye than normal.  weird.  so i went to the doctor and he gave me some goop for the eye but that didnt work, so later on i felt this feeling like i had a bug crawling around near my eye, and sure enough, there was an ant near my eye.  so i pulled my bottom eyelid back so i could look and inside there were about 100 ants.  seriously gross.  so i flushed them all out with water and i thought everything was ok.  no.  i felt more stuff crawling around in there, so i looked again and there was a wasp in there.  but not a full grown wasp, but a baby wasp, it was all red and mucousy.  as soon as i saw it i grabbed it and killed it.  i thought that must be the end.  no.  i looked again and there was a beetle in there.  i grabbed for the beetle but it somehow burrowed back into my head and i felt him crawling in there.  at this point i was freaking the hell out in my dream, but eventually forgot about the beetle.  i looked again later and saw the beetle in there and grabbed it and killed it.  i then woke up after that or at least i cant really remember anymore of it.  weird.  i told my wife, she didnt like it.  weird.

						   i've never disagreed with companies being able to conduct drug tests on their employees, but consider this:  my company was just aquired by another larger company and we get a packet of information and i start reading it.  "Additionally, all employees will be required to pass a drug screening and background check for continued emloyment."  now i'm not actually in danger of losing my job over this but when we were hired to our original company, we never agreed to anything like this, and now we have to get tested before oct 1st and if we fail we lose our jobs?  this might be the end all be all for some people at this company especially since most people don't even read those packets.  this is sort of like a hiring process eventhough we are already hired.  also, whats with the background check?  if they find out someone got arrested they are going to fire them?  is this a way to downsize without layoffs?  this "merger" (heh, we were aquired) is just more stress that i dont need.

						   have you seen the axe body spray commercials?  i watched one this weekend, the one where the guy wearing the spray opens his novel up and as he opens it, the super hot chick sitting across from him's shirt begins to unbutton the more and more he opens the book.  now, i dont know about pheromones or any of that, but that just doesnt seem like its real.  so i was thinking there would be something at the end that said something like "Dramatization" or something but it didnt.  so i asked my friend jenn if it was real, and she said yes.  buy this.
