       Virgo   You are  practical ,  realistic  and  dependable .  You pride yourself on your ability to be down to earth and see the world as it is, not through rose-colored glasses.  However, you do tend to see the world in a  cynical and critical way .  While you are a realist, there is also  disappointment and disapproval , in your opinion,  of how the world is .  In this sense you are a idealist and have firm ideas of how things should be.   You can put people off with your tendencies to be too critical and knit-picking.  Yet you are even more  hyper critical of yourself   and a perfectionist.  You see your own faults clearly and punish yourself for your weaknesses.  As a friend and lover you are  extremely caring , going to great lengths to do nice things for others.  You tend to show people you care by doing concrete things, like cooking dinner, rather than using words. You have a reserved demeanor and will  withdraw into yourself in uncomfortable situations . It usually  takes a while for people to get to know you .  Quick minded, you make connections faster than others and your wit and play on words can be hilarious.  You are always  dependable  and your  sincerity  lends a certain charm and innocence to those that appreciate you.  Helping others makes you feel good and you are likely to seek your career in a some field of service.  Life is a serious matter to you and you are concerned with doing everything the right and proper way.  You cringe when you think you’ve made a fool of yourself- being held in high regard by others is important to you.  You can be scolding, prissy, fussy and  worry too much .   You want all aspects of your life to be in order and can become  pessimistic and a kill-joy when things don’t go the way you think it should .  You tend to be a hard worker and take pride in your attention to detail and responsibleness.  The lesson of a Virgo is to  learn tolerance , see the bigger picture, and to  distinguish between  the  important and unimportant  and stop stretching yourself so thin.  In learning a balanced sense of judgement and priorities you will better be able to relax and enjoy life as it is, not as it should be.   Aquarius  You are  independent, friendly and analytical .  Others can think you odd because you seem to  follow your own beat  and don’t give a care to conventions.  You probably get a kick out of this and take it as a badge of pride.  You like to be unusual, to try and see things differently from other people and to take the road less traveled.  Although you can be quite practical and efficient  you are at heart an idealist.  You have many broad and lofty ideas about life and  live by your own code .  It can enrage you when others expect you to conform.  You are not one for traditions because they bore you and besides  your pretty sure you know a better way .  The  only real authority you respect is your own .   Authority, following it and respecting it,  can be a problem  for you.  These attitudes can lead you to be arrogant,  unreasonable  and unpredictable as you can often change your mind.  This isn’t a wishy-washy quality though.  When you do have an opinion it tends to be very firm, yet you can be very  open minded  in recognizing new ideas and incorporating them into your way of thinking.  You value  freedom ; freedom to express yourself and  live life as you choose .   One of your goals in life is to try and sway people to see things your way.  You are also a very friendly person and would rarely be described as shy.  You can talk to just about anyone about anything.  Most the people you know are acquaintances as you rarely form deep and lasting friendships.  You are a humanitarian and tend to see everyone as equally valuable.  This is a great quality but it does tend to limit lasting personal relationships when your siblings or love interest is as important as someone you just met at the supermarket.   The lesson of an Aquarius is to  form close personal bonds .  You need to recognize that although everyone is equally special and has a great role to play in society and human evolution, people need to be appreciated as the individual they are and loved for it, not just as another fellow human being.  Your high idealism and dedication to the brotherhood of man is of great value but can be cold without any personal involvement.

      Aquarians basically possess  strong and attractive personalities . They fall into two principle types:  one shy, sensitive, gentle and patient ; the other exuberant, lively and exhibitionist, sometimes hiding the considerable depths of their character under a cloak of frivolity. Both types are  strong willed  and forceful in their different ways and have strong convictions, though as they seek truth above all things, they are usually  honest enough to change their opinions , however firmly held, if evidence comes to light which persuades them that they have been mistaken. They have a breadth of vision that brings diverse factors into a whole, and can see both sides of an argument without shilly-shallying as to which side to take. Consequently they are unprejudiced and tolerant of other points of view. This is because they can see the validity of the argument, even if they do not accept it themselves.  They are nearly always  intelligent ,  concise, clear and logical . Many are strongly imaginative and psychically intuitive, so that the Age of Aquarius, which is about to begin, is much anticipated by psychic circles as an age in which mankind will experience a great spiritual awakening. The Aquarian philosophical and spiritual bent may be dangerous in that it can drive the subjects into an ivory-tower existence where they meditate on abstractions that bear little relevance to life. On the other hand it can help the many who have scientific leanings to combine these with the Aquarian yearning for the universal recognition of the brotherhood of man, and to embark on scientific research to fulfill their philanthropic ideals of benefiting mankind. When some cause or work of this nature inspires them, they are capable of such devotion to it that they may drive themselves to the point of exhaustion and even risk injuring their health.  In spite of the often intensely magnetic, forthcoming and open personality of the more extrovert kind of Aquarian, and of their desire to help humanity, neither type makes friends easily. They sometimes appear to condescend to others and take too little trouble to cultivate the acquaintance of people who do not particularly appeal to them. They  do not give themselves easily  - perhaps their judgment of human nature is too good for that - and are sometimes accounted cold. But  once they decide that someone is worthy of their friendship or love, they can exert an almost hypnotic and irresistible mental attraction on them and will themselves become tenacious friends or lovers, ready to sacrifice everything for their partners and be faithful to them for life . However, they are sometimes  disappointed emotionally  because their own high personal ideals cause them to demand more of others than is reasonable. And if they are deceived their anger is terrible. If disillusioned, they do not forgive.  Among the faults to which they are liable are fanatical eccentricity, wayward egotism, excessive  detachment  and an  inclination to retreat  from life and society, and a tendency to be extremely dogmatic in their opinions. Aquarians can be a threat to all they survey or a great boon for humanity in general. Circumstances - for example, continuous opposition to a cause they hold dear - may cause the atrophy of the openness of mind that is one of the Aquarian's most attractive traits. They may express a lack of integrity in broken promises, secretiveness or cunning.  Simmering anger and resentment, rudeness or, worse, a tense, threatening silence which may suddenly burst out in eruptions of extreme temper , these are all part of the negative side of the Aquarian. This can also reveal itself in a sustained hatred for enemies that is capable of enlarging itself into a misanthropy toward the whole of mankind.  LIKES Fighting for Causes Dreaming and Planning for the Future Thinking of the Past Good Companions Having Fun  DISLIKES Full of Air Promises Excessive Loneliness The Ordinary Imitations Idealistic  The color of choice for Aquarius is TURQUOISE  All of the above is information about Cody. Funny how some of this stuff is exact and then some of it is off. I thought all this was interesting and prooved alot.

      Virgo is the only zodiacal sign represented by a female. It is sometimes thought of as a potentially creative girl, delicately lovely; sometimes as a somewhat older woman, intelligent but rather pedantic and spinsterish. The latter impression is sometimes confirmed by the Virgoan preciseness, refinement, fastidious love of  cleanliness ,  hygiene and good order , conventionality and aristocratic attitude of reserve. They are usually  observant , shrewd,  critically inclined ,  judicious ,  patient , practical supporters of the status quo, and tend toward conservatism in all departments of life. On the surface they are  emotionally cold , and sometimes this goes deeper, for their habit of suppressing their natural kindness may in the end cause it to atrophy, with the result that they shrink from committing themselves to friendship, make few relationships, and those they do make they are  careful to keep .  But the outward lack of feeling may, in some individuals born under this sign, conceal too much emotion, to which they are afraid of giving way because they do not trust others, nor do they have  confidence in themselves  and their judgments. This is because they are  conscious of certain shortcomings in themselves  of worldliness, of practicality, of sophistication and of  outgoingness . So they bring the art of self concealment to a high pitch, hiding their apprehensiveness about themselves and their often considerable sympathy with other people under a mantle of matter-of-factness and undemonstrative, quiet reserve. They are still waters that run deep. Yet in their unassuming, outwardly cheerful and agreeable fashion, they can be  sensible , discreet, well spoken, wise and witty, with a  good understanding of other people's problems  which they can tackle with a practicality not always evident in their own personal relationships.  They are intellectually enquiring, methodical and  logica l, studious and teachable. They combine mental ingenuity with the ability to produce a clear analysis of the most complicated problems. They have an excellent eye for detail but they may be so meticulous that they neglect larger issues. Also, although they are realists, they may slow down projects by being too exact. They are practical with their hands, good technicians and have genuine inventive talents, Thoroughness, hard work and conscientiousness are their hallmarks, and they are such perfectionists that, if things go wrong, they are  easily discouraged . Because of their  ability to see every angle of a many-sided question , they are unhappy with abstract theorizing. Appreciating the many different points of view as they do, they find philosophical concepts difficult, and they vacillate and have no confidence in any conclusions at which they arrive. With these qualities, they are better as subordinates than leaders. Responsibility irks them and they often lack the breadth of strategic vision that a leader needs Virgoans are essentially tacticians, admirable in the attainment of limited objectives. Their self distrust is something they project on to other people and tends to make them exacting employers, though in the demands they make on those under them they temper this attitude with justice. They have  potential abilities in the arts, sciences and languages . Language especially they use correctly, clearly, consciously and formally, as grammarians and etymologists rather than for literary interests, yet they are likely to have a good memory for apt quotations. Although they are well suited for careers in machine drawing, surveying and similar occupations, they are better fitted for a job in a library or office than a workshop. Their minds are such that they need the stimulus of practical problems to be solved rather than the mere routine or working to set specifications that need no thought. They are careful with money and their interest in statistics makes them excellent bookkeepers and accountants. They also make good editors, physicists and analytical chemists. They may also find success as welfare workers, ministering to those less fortunate than themselves. They can be doctors, nurses,  psychologists , teachers, confidential secretaries,  technologists , inspectors, musicians,  critics , public speakers and writers especially of reference works such as dictionaries and encyclopedias. Both sexes have a deep interest in history, a feature recognized by astrological authorities for at least two hundred years. If they go in for a business career their shrewdness and analytical ingenuity could tempt them into dishonesty, though they usually have enough moral sense to resist temptation. Female Virgoans may find a career in fashion, for they have a flair for dress, in which they can be trend setters. In any profession they choose the natives of this sign readily assimilate new ideas, but always with caution, conserving what they consider worth keeping from the past. They love country life but are unlikely to make good farmers, unless they can contrive to carry out their work without outraging their sense of hygiene and cleanliness. Their faults, as is usual with all zodiacal types, are the extremes of their virtues. Fastidious reticence and modesty become old-maidishness and persnicketiness; balanced criticism becomes carping and nagging; and  concern for detail  becomes overspecialization. Virgoans are liable to indecision in wider issues and this can become chronic, turning molehills of minor difficulties into Himalayas of crisis. Their prudence can become guile and their carefulness, turned in on themselves, can produce worriers and hypochondriacs.  Possible Health Concerns... Virgo is said to govern the hands, abdomen, intestines, spleen and central nervous system. Illnesses to which its natives are prone include catarrh, cold, coughs, pleurisies, pneumonia and nervous instabilities. Their natures make them  inclined to worry  and this makes them vulnerable to stomach and bowel troubles, including colic and ulcers. Male Virgoans may have trouble with their sexual organs. Both sexes are strongly  interested in drugs  and  esoteric cuisine  and as their delicate stomachs require them to be careful about their diet, it is essential that they treat their fascination with exotic food with extreme care.  LIKES Health foods  Lists  Hygiene  Order  Wholesomeness DISLIKES Hazards to health Anything sordid Sloppy workers Squalor  Being uncertain   The colors for Virgo are GREEN AND DARK BROWN (I put the words that I thought did sound like me in bold)

         im so sick of fights, i hate them(like the blink 182 song) really i hate fighting and being mad and latly(well the past 2 days) me and cody just keep saying shit that makes each other mad. so then we end up fighting and we're mad. and i hate it. but its not all his fault we're fighting so even though i hate these fights, im causing them too. im not real sure why. i make myself so mad when i do that. im like no i dont want to fight but then i'll say somthing else and it'll make him mad then we argue all over again. today i said sothing to him about whether or not he wants to kiss me or hug me and all that because sometimes i feel like im getting on his nerves when i pull him close to me to hug or kiss him.he doesnt pull me towards him so i feel liek im making him hug me you know. so today i said something to him like " do u want to kiss me" or somthing and he got mad. and i was like well shit i cant really tell sometimes if you want me to or not. and he got mad again. he doesnt try to defend himself he just gets mad and looks away from me and doesnt say anything so of course im gonna say somthing to try and make him talk but that never works. it only makes it worse. then i start to feel like a real bitch because im sure he thinks im questioning wether or not he likes me /loves me /wants to be with / around me and i know it makes him mad but he doesnt try to proove me wrong. he never says anything liek well u know i want too kiss u or whatever. he just looks away and i can tell hes mad but he wont say anything. its real frustrating because im like trying to figure out why telling him how i feel makes him so mad. all i want is for us to be happy and to get along because im so happy that im with him. there is like no way to even describe how happy i really am in side. for any one who doesnt know, ive liked cody for about..2-3 yrs and we were always real shy around each other. we talked every now and then. we got to where we would talk online and stuff. he was always so funny, and we'd joke around with each other alot. but anyway i never directly told him i liked him, but i told other people who  i was sure would tell him. i guess they never did because he never asked me out or anything. so i started to think we'd never get together. so i ended up going out with some one else, for like 2 months. well actaully we werent going out but any way..thats a whole other long ass story. and then before long i heard he got a girlfriend. so i let it go. but then before long me and that other guy stopped talking/hanging out whatever. and cody still had his gf.(this was all last summer) so then school started and he still had his gf. i was jeoulous. i wandered why me and him never got together, and why her. so then his friend who was also a friend of mine(kalin) asked me to go with him and cody to bocktoberfest in october, which was in shiner. so i did. and man the whole way there i was like man i really wish cody didnt have a gf, because i still really liked him and wished i could be with him. so anyway we were gone like all day to that concert. it was a pretty awesome concert by the way. but then anyway on the way home, me and cody were sharin gthe backseat and we were tired so we were kinda laying down. so his face was like a few centimeters away. and i was like I HAVE TO KISS HIM of else ill regret it forever and who knows if id ever get the chance to kiss him again(and i dint care if he had a gf or not). i couldnt pass up this opportunity. so i did and it was wonderful like i knew it would be. but then for weeks after we never said anything about it and he continued to stay with his gf. but eventually in like the end of november they finally broke up. so then we started hanging out more. it got to where i felt like we were already going out so one night online i was like..you know, we already act like were going. so i told him if you want to be with me then tell me because i wanna be with you. so then finally we were together and i was(still am) the happiest person ever. so now its been 7 months next week. my longest relationship with anyone. hes so wonderful and i love him so much which is why it makes me so frustrated when we fight because we shouldnt be fighting. we should be happy.

        Remember when you hit that certain age and you realized that you were much to cool to be seen in public with your parents, well i guess it just recently hit me that..it is  o k  to be seen with them(or some of them) Yesturday I went to the store with Joy(my aunt/madre/legal guardian for those of you who dont know). I had Codys explorer and didnt have a car that is my own(well that i like to drive anyway-seperate story) anyway i like to drive Codys explorer and i felt like listening to a certain cd(butterfly boucher) and i felt like driving, so i agreed to drive Joy to the store and normally i would sit in the car and wait, but i actually went in with her. She was like wow! While we were walking around HEB i saw a package of peporoni and i found myself saying "me and cathy(my best friend) used to eat those raw". So i got some cuz they looked so damn good. But i keep seeing and thinking of little things like that. It's the little things i miss somtimes.
