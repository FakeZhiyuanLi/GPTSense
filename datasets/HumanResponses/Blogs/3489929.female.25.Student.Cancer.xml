      It's been a long time coming, but I have made some serious decisions about my life.  Seven years ago, I was 18 years old and the most naive person on the planet. I thought that my life would go exactly as I had always planned. I was going to finish college in three years (as I had already amassed enough credits in high school to finish by the time I was 20). Then I would move, victorious and complete in my own self-worth, to law school- preferably Ivy League- where I would be editor of the Law Review and graduate at the top of my class. Then I would be ensconced as a junior associate at a top private law firm making $75,000 a year by the time I was 25.  I turn 25 next month. I only finished two years of college- at two different schools- before I quit. I have spent the past five years working in an office and maintaining my job solely through my boss' inexplicable liking of me (because God knows, I've put him through hell). I have moved 16 times in five years because I cannot keep an apartment- or a roommate- to save my life. I have no savings and I have driven most of my friends away from my sheer hatred of myself. Those who have stuck around- I honestly don't know why. I feel unworthy of having anyone give a damn about me. I think about dying almost every day, because it makes me feel relieved to think I can escape from all of the misery in which I have ensconced myself.  It's time to make a move. I refuse to spend the rest of my life with barely enough money to live on. I refuse to live any longer beneath my potential. I refuse to give up on my life because there is still a lot I can do.  I'm smart, dammit. I'm better than this.  This is all contingent on student aid, but... I am moving back to Mississippi to go to the college at which I spent my disastrous freshman/sophomore year. Disastrous only because I was drunk (both literally and figuratively) with the idea of being away from my controlling, unrelenting parents. They had spent years hammering away at me, making me study when I wanted to play, eschewing any social life they perceived as damaging to their efforts to mold a daughter who would provide for them in their retirement. Well, not my mom so much. But my dad insisted that I live my life solely to go to college. I spent my childhood reading books. At my father's urging, I completed  Robinson Crusoe  at age 8,  Nicholas Nickleby  at age 10,  Gone With the Wind  at 11. Granted, I love to read, and that is due a lot to my father's influence. But maybe my life would have worked out differently if I had not been under such hellish pressure to succeed.  My father and I were close growing up. When I was a teenager, I hated my mother as much as I loved my father (there's a statement Freud would have a field day with). My daddy took my side over my mother numerous times, leading my mother to tell me regularly that I was going to cause them to divorce because they spent all their energy fighting over me. When I was a teenager, I found this funny. Now, I just find it sad.  In the back of my mind, I always knew my father's love for me was contingent solely upon my intelligence and the fact that I excelled at school and gave him fodder for the watercooler at work ("My daughter just made Honor Society." "My daughter got scholarships from all six of the schools she applied to." And so on). And that all changed in an instant when I veered off his preset path.   When I dropped out of school at age 20, I dropped off his radar. He never speaks to me. If I call the house to talk to my mother, he never says "Hello," or "How ya doing," or "Fuck you." It's just, "Hey, Daddy, it's me." "Oh. I'll get your mother." I think he literally hates me and doesn't even deign to put it into words. At holidays, I avoid him. Thank God there are only two "attendance required" holidays in my family, and they're only a month apart, so that gives me 10 months to avoid him.   As much as things have worsened with my father, they have improved with my mother. I love my mother. She listens to me and though she isn't always able to help me, she tries, which I more than I can say about my father. Mama is great. I regret I spent my teenage years hating her, because we could have been spending time together and I might have realized sooner what I have.  My mother knows of my plans to move to MS. She is under strict orders not to tell my father yet, but she did warn me that the minute I cross the state line, she is letting the cat out of the bag. I don't care. By then I'll be beyond his reach. And the first time he calls me to demand to know my grades (like he did  every single week  I was in MS before, I will bitch him out like I have been dying to do for years. This time, whether I succeed or fail, it's my own damn business.   Why did I decide to move back to MS? Couldn't I go to college here? Well, I could. But then I would still be around the crutches that I use every time I fall, and that's not good for me. I need to be someplace where it is all sink and swim, and it's all me out there on my own. For the first time in my life, I want to be completely self-sufficient.  I am setting myself up to fail spectacularly. This is why I am being extra careful in my planning. I have to make sure all of my little ducks are in a row before I screw myself over. First things first. I am moving to a place that is in the ghetto, but is much, much cheaper than where I have been living. I have to start saving if my plan is going to work. I'll be scared out of my mind, but as long as I have a bed to sleep in and a lock on my door (please, God, let there be a STURDY lock on the door), then I will be fine.  Step two is to either fix the car I have (problem with the fuel line) or get a new car. Do I trust old Silver, my '93 Mustang, to get me to MS and back three to four times a year? Before March, I would have said yes. Now, not so sure. I'll still chewing on this problem.  The rest of my plan is still being fleshed out, and I am getting anxious and trying to get this done before July, so I can start for the summer session. But I am trying to be patient and wait until fall. Here's why. The last time I "took a sabbatical" from my job (loooong story), I started back on July 14 of last year. Coming up this July 14, on my one-year anniversary, I will have one week's vacation. If I can wait that long, I can cash it in before I quit and have the extra money, plus whatever bonuses I earn between now and then. The problem is that I don't really want to quit my job. I want to work on my time off from school. I'll have the entire month of December and May through August off every year, and I will be spending them here in AL. I have to see if my boss is amenable to that, or even to letting me work comp in MS. My job is all by phone anyway. We'll have to see about that one. I'm not sure (in fact, I'm almost positive) he doesn't trust me enough to do that yet.  I finally feel optimistic and even hopeful for the first time in years. If this works out, I'm on my way. My worst enemy is myself. If I can conquer that, then I have nothing else to worry about.  To quote an old friend, "Life is study." Consider me a devoted student.

      Yeah, I was a leeeeetle pissed off earlier this afternoon. I know just how pissed I was when I said "clift" instead of "cliff." :) I'm okay now, but... whew.  Let me tell you... I cannot wait to leave this all behind. Seriously. I want to start school so bad, I can taste it. Less than 2 more months, and then I am home free. I will never darken their doors again. I am serious this time. I refuse to get sucked in again. I just don't understand why everything has to be so damn miserable there. It's like no one really cares about trying to make it better. Everyone is stuck in the same rut as me. Everyone has these issues. Believe me. I know I'm not the only one.  And Lisa: I hope you feel better soon. :(

      Happy 21st birthday to my baby brother Nick!!!!!!!!! Have a beer on me, baby bro.  God, I'm old.  I remember when we were kids, and Nick was so small for his age, that the day he started sixth grade and rode the middle-school bus for the first time, the bus driver told him to get off and wait for the elementary school bus, and I had to tell her that he was older than he looked.  Now he's taller than me and has the beginnings of a beer gut, according to my youngest brother John, who sees him more than I do.  You have to understand- Nick's a hermit. I haven't seen him since Christmas, even though I go to my parent's house at least once a month, if not more. He's either never there, or holed up in his bedroom drawing something (my baby brother is a kick-ass anime artist).   I hope he buys some beer and brings it home to piss my dad off. Ha!  Moving on...  What a day (be warned- loooong work rant ahead).  Cracky came back to work and seems to have learned the Workplace Golden Rule: Thou shalt not deign to address the folks your absence screwed over. She kept to her druggie self all day long and I was thankful for it. The one time she addressed me, I snapped at her, and then she left me alone. Hmph.  Blondie has to have major surgery next week and thus will be out for a good six weeks. A bad six weeks, on my part... I lose my bitch partner!!! I feel bad for her, and selfishly, I feel bad for myself that I'll have to deal without her.  The saddest thing is, she's scheduled to come back   after   I leave for Mississippi. So more than likely, this is our last week working together. :(  Should I feel bad for encouraging her  not  to come back at all? I know the place makes her miserable, and after two-and-a-half years working there, Jefe still doesn't seem to like her very much, and she tends to annoy the shit out of Posh. I love her to death personally, but I am also not biased enough to realize that she is not as good as myself and Barbie (unfortunately) and has not really progressed throughout her tenure at the company. She stays steady- but on a lower plane than the rest of us, whereas I have a few lows and then many months of highs. Jefe just doesn't seem to have taken a liking to her as he has to myself and Barbie and Posh. I can't quite put my finger on why.  Speaking of liking... according to Posh, he was surfing the web and found something he really liked for me, so he ordered it and she gave it to me today. It's a set of Hello Kitty dominoes. I freaking love it. :)   See, the thing is, only Posh and I get this kind of stuff. Jefe always finds little butterfly things for her and Hello Kitty stuff for me, but he has never had the inclination to search out stuff that Blondie might like, or Barbie or Cracky for that matter. Like I said, it kinda stumps me, mainly because I can't figure out why he likes me so damn much. I make his life hell a vast majority of the time! While I don't understand it, I do appreciate the hell out of it. It's nice to be thought of. :)   I think I am going to take advantage of the fact that Jefe seems to be in a good mood and ask him if I can go ahead and take a loan out on the vacation pay I will receive in the middle of July. I really, really must get my car fixed. It's getting to the point where I am scared to drive it because it shakes and rattles so bad. I mean, it's getting me where I need to go, but it's taking me forever because I have to stay off the interstate, and preferably all major highways as well. The day it breaks down, I may break down as well.  And I don't want to get rid of the car, because 1) I cannot afford a car payment right now (or probably  ever ), and 2) I really do like the Mustang, especially when it's RUNNING.  Time to go watch some  Jeopardy.  Since I haven't had occasion to really use my brain in, oh, five years, I like to give it some exercise every now and then. Besides, that guy who keeps winning on there who's been on almost twenty times now and won more than half a million dollars kicks ass- and I can't wait to see his eventual downfall.   I hope it's a woman that beats him.

      I make excellent lasagna. Just ask Ricotta Monkey (sorry, Lisa, but that was your only contribution, after all).   So much for my great idea to start dieting this weekend. Posh will kill me... I promised to start so we can help each other. But, considering the fact that the girl is only looking to lose ten pounds- that she really can't afford to lose- I'm not feeling too inclined to encourage her weight loss anyway.  I keep telling myself that when I get my Gazelle, I will actually stick with it and use it every day. I've been lusting after one for a year, so this is a realistic thought. However, knowing myself, I know that I will probably be gung-ho for a month and then store it under my bed, never to be seen again. C'est la vie. That's me.  I want to watch X-2 tonight; I saw it when it came out in theaters, but due to my squirrel-sized bladder, I missed a couple of parts of the movie. Same with Harry Potter three weeks ago. I need to go see it again because of my God-forsaken, useless Kegel muscles. My Ben-Wa balls will go to waste, of this I am certain. Anyway... I am waiting for Lisa to make up her mind as to when she wants to start the movie. She said earlier that she didn't want to watch  Finding Nemo , and lo and behold, she showed up 15 minutes after I had started the movie and watched the whole thing. Weirdo.  LMAO... she just came in here waving a pencil with a penis (or "payness," as she pronounced it) eraser and yelled, "It's a glow-in-the-dark tallywacker!"  Between her glow-in-the-dark eraser and my Day-glo condom finger puppets, we could have a really kinky adult puppet show going on up in here.

      Oh, what a busy fucking week it has been. A crazy, busy fucking week.  But first...  Happy birthday to me!!!  (for another hour-and-a-half).   I moved back in with Lisa today. It's a good thing. I can help her financially, and I can save some money before I leave for Mississippi. I'm trying to be considerate and make sure that I know the score up front this time around ( "I solemnly swear I will not eat your food, and will use but 1 glass per week" ), because the last time I lived with her, we were both miserable. I think this time will be better, though. Live and learn.  I wish I could have taken the day off for my birthday, but I will settle for cashing in my vacation next month and taking a long weekend at the beach (hey, Lisa- you provide the transportation, I provide the accomodations, huh?). And once I cash in my vacation pay, I can get my freaking car fixed. As it is now, when trying to figure out how long it will take me to get somewhere, I have to tack on an extra five minutes for every ten that it normally takes, cuz that car takes its own sweet time going where the fuck it wants to go.  The reason I could not take off early today is because Crackhead has been out for three days (but is miraculously well enough to come in and get her paycheck after work) and Barbie had to leave early to go out of town- why, I'll never know, since her destination is none other than Columbus, where I will be living come fall, and I know for a fact that it takes less than 2 hours to get there, so why all the drama about having to leave early because she didn't "want to be on the road all day?" Geez.  Plus, I have been training a new girl (I was thinking I would refer to her as Paris, because her face resembles a certain amateur porn queen, but I might change that to Rebel Yell because... well, she's just that country) all week and I finally turned her over to Posh today because I just couldn't handle it anymore, and that left two people- Blondie and myself- on the phone full-time, and one trainee who didn't know shit. Not exactly an auspicious birthday, if you know what I mean.  And more bad news to come. I was really pushing for them to fire Crackhead in deference to Paris/Rebel Yell, but that probably won't happen now because Blondie is going in for surgery in two weeks and will be out for six weeks after that. She probably won't come back until the week I leave (funny). So we can't afford to get rid of Crackhead, because on the rare days that she does show up, at least there's a trained Helper Monkey answering the phones, even half-assed as she tends to do.  Quote of the Day:  Paris/Rebel Yell:  sitting at Cracky's desk  "Gosh, none of her pens work." Me: "That ain't the only thing around here that doesn't work."  (ATTENTION: LOSS OF IMPULSE CONTROL AHEAD)  For the love of all that is good and pure in this world!!!!!!!! Come to work, bitch!!!!!!!!!! I dare you to actually work a full fucking week!!!!!!!! If not for your coworkers, who could use the break, for your crack habit!!!!!!!! That shit ain't free, ya know!!!!!! And no one wants what you're selling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Groooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnn.  And breathe.  I intend to spend the weekend relaxing- trying to forget the idiocy that awaits me Monday morning- and watching all the movies I've missed on InDemand before the cable service is disconnected on Monday. *sigh* There's like ten of them. And no, Lisa, this will not be shades of marathon  Sex and the City . I will pace myself and only watch the most important. Which may well be all of them. Okay, so I'll watch them at breakneck speed back-to-back. Don't judge.  I am so glad to be sitting in this apartment right now. I've left the ghetto, baby!   Movin' on up... to the East Side... to a deluxe apartment... in the sky...   Or a two-bedroom walk-in apartment by the duck pond?  Doesn't have the same ring.   Movin' on up...

      So Jefe comes in this morning at 9:00, when the phone has been ringing off the hook and it has already been back-to-back mania all morning. And the first words out of his mouth? Not "Good morning." That's too much to hope for. No, the first words out of his mouth are, "I have already gotten 2 complaints about rudeness so the next one I get, I'm knocking that person down to $5.15/hour for the entire week. No explanation, no justification."  I wonder if one of them was about me (probably was). I know one of them was about Crackhead. She talked to a woman today who was bitching about being on hold, and Cracky had her on mute, and heard the woman say to the person in the background, "I'm getting a fucking headache from this shit." Cracky got back on the phone: "You have a headache? Maybe you should take some Tylenol for that. How can I help you?" Customer did not appreciate that very much.   This is my influence.  Oh, well.  There is war being declared in my department because two of us (Barbie and Cracky) are not answering the damn phone when it rings, and two of us (Blondie and myself) are picking up the slack. Very, very annoying. I have spent the day bitching and complaining and making notes and insisting that we have a meeting this week so these issues can be addressed. And they haven't been.   Oh my Gawd. I almost forgot. Cracky took off her bra in front of everyone today. Did not need to see that. And considering that she sits in front of a huge plate-glass window, I'm certainly hoping no one outside saw that either.  She is so gross. She gets these scabs on her forehead all the time and she sits there with a mirror propped up on her keyboard and picks at them and squeezes them all day long. Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Take it to the bathroom, Grossy-Gross. At home. Far away from civilized people.  I hate that this entire post has been dedicated to work, but I need to let it off somehow. I cannot wait until August.   There's no place like school... there's no place like school... there's no place like school...

      It's been a long weekend. I haven't really done anything. It's just been a long weekend.  We have a new girl. I want to tell her to run. Far, far away. I want to warn her that this job will suck out her soul and leave behind an empty, bitter shell of a human being. I want to point to myself and say, "Hey, New Girl, take a look at what YOU'LL be five years from now if you stay here."  Oy.  In the arena of good news, I am only 20 bucks away from winning a Gazelle machine at work in the incentive program. By next week, hopefully I will have ordered it. Yippee. Only thing I have to look forward to this week.  Not happy about the birthday coming up. I have this innate fear that everyone will either forget or not care enough to get me diddly shit. After all of the birthdays I have helped compensate over the past year... I'd better be getting some good diddly shit.  I don't do it just to make sure I get gifts on my birthday- though that is a major part of it. People (i.e. management) at my job just don't take the time or have the inclination to help people celebrate it. I always make sure I have a card and some little trinket or bauble to give to everyone- at least, those I know and care about within the company- on their birthday. To make them feel good. Appreciated, even.   They'd better remember me. Or come birthday time, I will be pissed.  I am turning TWENTY-FIVE. That is a quarter of a century. Two and a half decades. I am fucking OLD. And nowhere where I thought I'd be by now.  I have spent the past seven years of my life on a derailed train hurtling towards oblivion.   I seriously think I must have broken a ton of mirrors in 1997 to be where I am today.  At least I'm finally trying to get back on track.

      It's days like this that make my decision to leave my job a no-brainer.  I had a guy call me yesterday and act like a total prick, then proceed to tell me that I am "freaking rude." Okay. I let it slide, said goodbye politely, and hung up. He called back today, got me again, and when I reminded him that I was the one he talked to yesterday, he apologized- twice- for his behavior and very sweetly asked for an extension on his account. Which, due to my ever-benevolent nature, I granted without a problem. He then proceeds to call back the application line and leave an "anonymous" complaint saying that the girl he talked to when he first called (we call her "Cracky," as in "crackhead") was an "angel" and the girl he talked to next (me) was "not." So then Jefe calls Posh and demands to know what happened. And Posh explains to Jefe that she knew about the call and that the prick had apologized- twice- for HIS rude behavior and said not a word to me about being rude to him. And then she got pissed because he was questioning whether she had control of her department, and, as she told me, she desperately wanted to tell him, "I know what goes on in my fucking department!" (but unlike me, who has called him all manner of names, including "dick," with no regret, she's too scared to tell him to his face what she thinks about his interference). Oooooohhhhhh, my aching head.  And Cracky didn't show up to work today, and Barbie came in two hours late, and I asked Jefe to buy me and Blondie some lunch for having to make up the slack, and he said no. So I ate Pizza Hut again. And now my tummy hurts.  So, like I said. Knowing that if I stay here, this is what my life will be like for years on end, I say "NOT." I choose to move on. Screw every one of them.  In other news, I have discovered that yes, my father really does hate me. I am not exaggerating. I called my mother today and casually mentioned that I had not gotten a response to an e-mail I sent my father a week ago and she said, "Oh, he told me to tell you blah-blah-blah." I asked Mom- "Why couldn't he just hit the "reply" button and tell me that himself?" Neither of us answered the question because we already know the truth. He fucking hates me. So I told my mother he's not getting a Father's Day gift since he does not know how to behave like a father.  She also went against my wishes and told him I am going back to Mississippi. She said he "hopes you do well there." Yeah, right. I only hope I do so I can have the pleasure of NOT inviting him to my graduation. Asshole. That'll teach him to treat his own daughter like she's expendable. Nothing like having a goal in mind, huh?  I'm only a  little  bitter.

      Conversation of the Day:  Posh: "So, did you get any party favors at the sex toy party last week?" Me: "Yeah, a Day-Glo condom. I gave it to Lisa." Posh: "Why'd ya do that?" Me: "What the hell else was I going to do with it? It's not like I have any use for it, other than painting a face on it and using it as a finger puppet."  I have circumvented the IRS (take that, bureaucratic assholes). I called the Dubya and asked the financial aid office if they knew of a way to get a copy of my tax return. She said she could mail me a form to request one. Score!!!  V.v. good day today, after a sad start. Blondie (co-worker SH, and yes, Lisa, to answer your question, it was she that I had "subterfuged" yesterday) came in this morning bawling because a friend of her family died in a car accident last night. And her cousin died two weeks ago. And to top it off, as if her morning wasn't already shit, she hit and killed a kitten on the way to work. :(  Jefe noticed, was a little irritated that she was a mess, and told Posh to send her home. She left sobbing these little staccato bullet-like sobs that made me feel so bad for her. But is it also really, really bad of me to be glad they sent her home? I mean, I could not have gotten anything done today if I was worrying about her being able to hold it together on the phone. Right?   Then Posh told me that Jefe had a surprise for me. He got me one of those full-length massasing pads that goes in your chair and has three different speeds and HEAT (oooohhhh) massage. Homina. Love the folks at Homedics. Found out that you cannot turn it on high while on the phone because my voice sounded like it does when someone is beating you on the back while you're talking. Very cool for a party trick, not so cool when trying to open an account over the phone.  Other downside- it made me start bleeding again. I swear, if I jar my pelvis just a little bit, it's like free rein to bleed like a muthafucka. But you know what? I'll bleed a river if the cause makes me feel SO DAMN GOOD.  The others are jealous. And pissed. And I don't care. My boss loves me right now. He told me my attitude is great, my calls are fabulous, and my performance is the best it has been in months. He gave me the greatest compliment of all, though, when he said he has stopped focusing his energy on me and is going to leave me alone to do my thing.  Hallelujah, Mr. Gooooooden!!!!!!!!!!  I love it when he lets me "do my thing." That means two to three months of freedom and MONEY. He pays me well when he leaves me alone.   Of course, I'm set to screw him- and not in a fun way- in two months, so my victory is tinged with bittersweetness...  But I'm here now. And I'll milk it for all I'm worth.

      The IRS sucks major ass.  I was on the phone with them for 20 minutes and ran over my lunch break waiting for some dumb heifer with the mental speed of a blind deaf-mute to tell me that she can mail me a computer transcript of my tax return, but she cannot send me a photocopy of the one I signed because they don't "keep" those. Hello?!?!? Aren't you the GD IRS? Don't you people keep  every-fucking-thing?   Yeah, I'll probably be audited next year (though, good luck with that, morons- I have nothing. Nothing!!!).  In other news, I completely subterfuged one of my coworkers today to get more money and recognition for myself. And it worked, amazingly enough. I feel kind of bad for her, because she's gonna be pissed when she comes to work tomorrow and finds that things have changed for her, but... oh, well. I have enough to worry about.  Like my boss finding out I am moving out of the state in two months. With all of the perks I am getting right now, it would be disastrous if my evil, nefarious plans came to light before I'm ready.  I'm not manipulative, I'm just drawn that way.  BTW, can I just say that I think it is so funny that Courteney Cox named her new baby girl Coco. As in Chanel. Or "I'm cuckoo for Coco puffs."  And I also think it's hilarious how Blogger will advertise certain things on your blog that they see in your posts. For example. Mine is now advertising tequila after this past weekend's debacle. Maybe I should write an entire post about herpes and see if they advertise something along those lines.  Or... maybe not.  My car is acting progressively worse and I am scared to get behind the wheel. I know I am pushing my luck and every trip may be my last. God, if you let me make it through the next few weeks without breaking down, I'll be very, very good. I'll eat my veggies and drink lots of water and be nicer to everyone.  Oh, who am I kidding? After that b.s., God may decide to blow up the car with me in it (but please, please don't.)  Posh told us a joke today at work that her dad, of all people, told her.  "What did one saggy tit say to the other?" "We'd better get some support before somebody thinks we're nuts."

      Oh, my aching head.  It's almost 10AM and why I am already at the library, only God knows. I was only able to sleep for 4 hours, and then only sporadically. Usually when I drink straight tequila- which, granted, is rare- I am down for the count the following day. Other than a pounding headache, though, I feel rather lucid.  I remember Lisa throwing one of her Ben-Wa balls- after use- at me (she was WAY more drunk than me, which is also rare). She said I threw it back and hit her in the shoulder. Ew. I can't believe I actually touched it (on a personal note, I tried putting my own in this morning as a test run, but for some reason, I could not get them to stay in there. And when they were in, they would not move. Aren't those little fuckers supposed to roll?!?!?).  FYI, for anyone who's interested. Getting drunk last night was NOT my idea. Yes, I paid for half the tequila, but then again, we barely finished half the bottle. I think I did 4 shots, Lisa 3 or 4, I can't remember. Plus I had a tubie. Yum yum.  I did get readmitted to MUW without a problem. And since I make a mere pittance at my job and my tax returns reflect that, I have to provide proof of last year's income to the school so I can get my aid package set up. And since I am a dumbass and did not make a copy of my tax return before mailing it in, I need to figure out how to get it so I can send it to the school. Any suggestions?  Why am I awake? I need more sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

      I'm at Lisa's. I just had a tube shot. My ears are already burning. Bring on the Cuervo!  Ben Wa balls rock. I love sex toy parties.  P.S. Lisa- if I start biting you again after getting hyped up on tequila, please feel free to knock the shit out of me.

      I can't find a title I like. I keep changing it every coupla days. Eventually one will stick. I kinda like this one.   I am tired. I spent the entire morning at work trying to pretend that I wasn't tired. I also spent the majority of the morning trying to convince Posh to convince El Jefe to let us take the day off work on Friday, as it is the national day of mourning and the banks and post offices will be closed. Even though Jefe is not even going to be there, as he is going to opening night Van Hagar- I mean, Van Halen- in North Carolina, I don't think my idea is going to fly. Pooh.  I feel really, really sad about Ronald Reagan dying. I mean, he's the first president I can remember (vaguely) and my parents thought he was like a god. Hell, most people in the South did, seeing as how you can't swing a dead cat around here and not hit a Republican. It's like a piece of my childhood has died. I admit it. I cried when I heard about it (then again, I cry at everything, so... not a good example).   I still haven't heard from MUW. I wonder if I got in. The woman in Admissions said it would basically be a straight readmission and then I could contact the financial aid office to make sure they received my FAFSA and my student loan forms. I also applied for work-study. I'd rather work on-campus than off.  Call of the day: A Mexican guy calls in, says he wants to know what "youse peoples" are going to do for him (which is actually more Jersey than anything, although this guy was from Arizona). I explained that he called us in March asking the same question and our company still has the same function as it did then. And when I continue to talk, he starts to interrupt me with "Miss, miss..." over and over again, though it sounds more like "Meeeeese, meeeeeese..." So I keep talking over him like I can't hear him, because he is really getting on my nerves, and he keeps it up. "Meeeese, meeeese..." So finally-  "Sir, what can I do for you, since you are intent on interrupting me this morning?"  "What are youse peoples going to do for me?" *Sigh* "Didn't we explain this to you when you called in March?" "I dunno." "Do you remember calling our company?" "No." "How'd you get the number?" "I dunno." "So you just woke up this morning and said, 'Hmm. I think I'll call this random number today just to annoy people.' Is that it, sir?" *Pause* "I dunno." *Bigger sigh* "Do you know  anything , sir?"  I deal with these kinds of people on a daily basis, folks. I can't wait to get a real job.

      I have spent the entire day bleeding like someone jammed a faucet "up there" and turned it on full blast. I hate my period. Especially when it has lingered now for four looooong weeks. I have to wait to stop bleeding profusely before I can schedule an appointment with the "woman doctor," though, and judging from the way things are going, that could be a while.  Now that I am done grossing myself (and you) out...  I have serious issues with my immediate supervisor. We'll call her Posh, since she looks almost exactly like Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh Spice. Posh has been working at the company for five years, having started a month after me. But whereas I have taken a "sabbatical"- twice- over the past several years, my time served doesn't count. As is, my one-year anniversary is next month.   Normally, when someone makes it to five years, they receive lunch on their anniversary, some flowers and/or balloons, and a small bonus check. Posh, however, having wended her way so sinuously into the inner sanctum of our boss, received a Louis Vuitton wallet (to match the $1500 Louis bag she just purchased), a Louis Vuitton fountain pen (really- who needs that?!?!?), and a brand-new, completely tricked-out cell phone. Market value of all of this? Oh, about $700. That's all.  And I can't get any money to repair my car...  I dislike her because she shows off all of her stuff but acts like she's modest and embarrassed to be showing it to people. She preens like a damn peacock. She spent the past two days playing with the damn cell phone and not answering sales calls, while we, her department, have been backed up and slammed with back-to-back calls. And since my boss didn't make his happy way into work until almost 3, he saw none of this.  It's cathartic to write about here, because if I had gone with my first instinct and walked into El Jefe's office and bitched about her behavior, I probably would have been sent home. As it is, I ignored her all day, which means he'll hear about it anyway, because on days when I don't talk to her, I have an attitude problem.  Oh, well.  If she had her way, I wouldn't have been given a raise last week. And she wasn't supposed to know about it, until she looked at my paycheck and saw it.  I don't know what her problem is. She'll always make more than me and get more than me, seeing as how her pig nose has a permanent brown cast to it from having been up the boss's ass so much.  Am I jealous? Hell, yes. I've been there longer, "sabbaticals" nonwithstanding. And I'm better than her. And smarter. She's prettier, but I'm a hell of a lot smarter. Shouldn't that count for something?  Oh, wait. I forgot where I work.

      Oh, what a day. The trials and tribulations of the women I work with are unbelievable. In the space of a weekend, one relative has died and one husband has left. Oh, my aching head.  When it comes to those I love, I like to think that I am a compassionate person when these people are in pain. However, my coworkers are something else. I have to work with these people, for crying out loud, and most of the time, I wish they would disappear. It is hard to strike the right balance between professionalism (i.e. not getting caught talking about personal issues during business hours) and friendly interest and concern (i.e. making people I don't really honestly care one whit about think that I am there for them in thick and thin). And since it is naturally in my nature to gossip, it is hard for me to keep things to myself. So I want to tell other people about my coworkers' sundry problems... and then I realize that no one else really cares. Which really bursts my bubble.  I feel for these women, don't get me wrong. But their problems pervaded MY work space today, making our entire department suffer, because people were down in the dumps all day, and that makes our boring job even tougher to take. You have to have a modicum positivity in there, or it's all sink and no swim.  I cannot relate to someone whose husband has left them. I CAN relate to someone who has lost a loved one, as I lost my beloved Pa-Paw almost ten years ago. But I can't talk to someone about their recently-deceased, because it reminds me of my own pain and has me in inconsolable tears for hours (I have yet to come to terms with my grandfather's death, but that's a tale for another day when I am not so tired or emotional).   In short, I am no good at dealing with other people's problems. I have enough of my own to worry about, and I have enough trouble trying to figure out how to solve those, let alone the problems of the world.  I need a beer.

      So here's the kink in the plan. My boss.  I have the utmost amount of gratitude for the man who has kept me employed through thick and thin these past five years. Without him, I may have given up a long time ago and crawled under a rock to live out the rest of my days as an unwashed hobo. I feel like the world's biggest ass for not telling him about my plans to move to MS.  Here's why. Tuesday morning, he pulled me into his office and told me that he was aware that I have been very unhappy the past several months (yes, I am that transparent) and offered me a raise and bonuses and other myriad little enticements to perk me up. And it did, and I performed accordingly the majority of the week, but at the same time, I am eaten alive with guilt.  God help me, I care about this man's opinion of me, and he has given me so many chances, he will think I am deliberately shitting on him (for lack of a better term) if I leave. And I really, really don't want that.  Do I tell him now? Do I tell him later? Do I never tell him, and change all of my plans, and put all my hopes and dreams for myself on hold, and stay here and work at this job for the rest of my life?  Should I stay, or should I go?

       Only this time, it was the end of my day that sucked.   I made my wonderful lasagna again for our potluck at work. Everyone loved it. We polished it off between the five of us in my department (sorry, Lisa). We all had a good time.   Now, let me quickly explain that Jefe has told me to keep an eye on Posh and to let him know when she does something she is not supposed to do (read magazines, call her boyfriend, eat at her desk, trim her arm hair with her scissors). I have to write him a report every day and give it to him. SUPPOSEDLY this was confidential and he was not to have told her where he is getting his information.   So Posh sees me get up, go into his office, and hand him my report, not knowing what it is. And two minutes later, he calls her in his office and apparently bitches her out, because she comes back in crying and when I ask her what's wrong she ignores me, and when I ask her anything work-related she looks right through me. Which totally pissed me off. So I went into Jefe's office after work and bitched him out because he had told me it would be confidential and now she's treating me like crap. So he tells me that THAT pisses HIM off (her acting like that) and he would take care of it, because he's pissed enough at her as it is.   Grrrrrrrrrrr. This is why I don't like narcing (narking?) on Posh. He always tells her it's me watching her. He claims&nbsp;that my reporting on and evaluating her is to teach me "management skills." Shee-it. Like he's ever going to replace her with me. Satan will be climbing the Matterhorn when that happens.   More and more like high school every day. That should be the company's motto.   I am planning menus for next week. My Gazelle came with an eating guide and I am going to try that at my mother's request. Apparently, her cardiologist has told her that Atkins is not a good idea, and she thinks I should do something else, for her own peace of mind. This is also why she will never allow me to get bypass, even though I don't want that either. My cousin, a.k.a. Newly-Skinny Slut, got the surgery and then also had to go back for plastic surgery to get rid of all of her excess skin. NSS has been sick ever since and can only eat enough food to fill your palm in one sitting. She keeps getting put back in the hospital for infections and shit. But to be honest, it's not necessarily the surgery's fault. She doesn't take care of herself and make sure she's getting all of the nutrients she needs. Plus, according to the family, she's begun to give it up to every guy who gives her a second glance, which is not much different than she was in high school, so I'm not sure why everyone in the family is surprised by her behavior now. But at the same time, she's a young mother (her baby is only two), and newly divorced, and hardly working- her mother (Lady Di) is paying all of her bills. She's acting a little crazy for someone who should be a bit more responsible.   And I'm one to talk.   But anyway, I'm a chickenshit when it comes to surgery and hospitals, so I totally would never do bypass. And I get so easily tired of Atkins anyway. I think I will try Tony Little's plan, and if all else fails, there's always Subway.

      Yippee!  urlLink It's Hump Day ! Let's skip the fries and party our buns off in celebration of Hamburger Day commemorating the creation of the hamburger in 1900 by Louis Lassing.   Loonies and Loonettes -- start your engines and let's warm-up for the hump. For this warm-up, put your humility away and using the letters H-A-M-B-U-R-G-E-R reveal to us nine wonderful things about you.    I am:    &nbsp;  HOPELESSLY devoted to those I love;   AMAZINGLY creative and smart;   MAGNIFICENT at my job;   BEAUTIFUL inside and out;   UNPREDICTABLE and loads of fun;   READY always to explore and learn;   GRATEFUL to be alive;   EAGER to grow and become more than I already am;   RADIANT when I am happy!    &nbsp;  [Wow, I think a lot of myself :)]    &nbsp; This week let's do a getting-to-know-you-hump mixed with some cwaziness to make it a fun hump too. Ready? Hump it!   01. You have opened a fast food joint that features YOUR favorite food prepared in many different forms. What would the name of your joint be? List several things that would be on the menu.  Potatoes 'R' Us. (ripping off  Forrest Gump)  You can broil 'em, bake 'em, fry 'em, boil 'em, mash 'em... there's potato salad, potato pancakes, baked potato, potato chips, creamed potatoes, french fries...   02. You are holding a public auction for all your belongings ... what is the oddest or silliest item that would be on the auction block?  I have a collection of several weird and wonderful pillows... Hello Kitty, Powerpuff Girls, Daffy Duck, fuzzy hearts...   03. If you could buy "instant anything" what would it produce when you just add water?  Instant money, bay-bee!   04. If it were possible to miniaturize any sort of environment and keep it in an aquarium-like enclosure, what type of environment would it be and what sort of creatures would you keep in it?  My workplace, and all of my coworkers, especially the evil ones, will be my little pawns to play with as I please. Wah-ha-ha!   05. If you were offered a "Get Out of Jail Free" type of card today (i.e. magically fix something, get out of doing something, etc...) what would the card be for?  I would get out of going to work all week (but still get paid) and get my butt down to the beach, stat!    &nbsp;  Hump-a-rific!

        Daily Horoscope:       &nbsp;   It's time for you to take a stand, but it could be a difficult thing to do. Sometimes your feelings are so strong that it's easier for you to pretend that everything's ok, even when it's not. Take the pressure off your internal emotional build-up by letting off a little steam in a socially acceptable way. Tackle football or bullfighting may not work for everyone. Find something physical that works for you.      Something physical as in... breaking down at your desk and crying and shuddering so hard that someone in your office thought you might be having a seizure (Cracky tends to overdramatize)?    I will be pounding it out on the Gazelle (or the "antelope," as Lisa calls it) tonight.   But in all seriousness... my day ended much better than it began. I pulled Posh aside (without throwing her out of the window) and explained that I was frustrated and then my afternoon began to be better. And out of the goodness of my heart (actually, I got trapped into it), I stayed an hour late and helped Posh clean the office.   But I couldn't resist coming around a dark corner and yelling, "Look out!" at the top of my lungs. It did my devilish little heart good to see her jump a full foot in the air. :)   Maybe tomorrow will be better.

        My   urlLink Gazelle    has come home. :)     Now it will probably sit in the box for a couple of days until I get the impetus to put it together. Ahh, the joys of a home exercise machine.   I also received the hat that I ordered for Jefe a month ago off Ebay. To avoid feedback retaliation from the lying dude I bought it from (he told me he mailed it, then when I called him on it, he claimed he "forgot" and would mail it right away) I put some generic b.s. (thanks, nice hat, etc.). Plus, I also received a first-edition of   urlLink  Iris'     The Killing Game , and I can expect to receive&nbsp;four more books, a purse, and a tie. Then I am quitting Ebay cold turkey for a while. I went a little crazy there and I need to try to have a little more self-control.   A girl at work (we call her "Stacked" because, well, she always has been even before she got pregnant) is having her baby shower this weekend, and Lisa and I are going. The nursery will be Baby Snoopy- how cute is that? I love babies. I want a baby. I think they make adorable accessories, kind of like Prada bags or Steve Madden shoes (okay, I am so seriously kidding here- I did NOT go to the Jessica Simpson School for Mothering).   But now that I am on the subject, I would love to have kids one day. One day waaaaay in the future, when I am able to be self-sufficient and hopefully have a husband/significant other to help lighten the weary load. I'll probably have kids when I hit thirty. My mom says that's fine, cuz she'll be 50 then and won't be a young grandma.   My mom will be such a good grandma. Not like my grandmother, who would cut you down where you stand&nbsp;and feed you to a pack of wolves if it would make good family drama. I know I can count on my mom to let my kids know that even if they are horrible brats, she loves them anyway. She'll be a warm, attentive, slightly goofy&nbsp;grandparent.   Daddy, not so much.   Some woman in Iowa screamed at me today that I was rude because I told her if she missed her deadline to open her account with our company, she would have to find another company to help her because we can't keep extending her approval. She bitched me out and said I broke some law because I insinuated that she's not serious about paying her debts, and it's illegal to do that.   Holy litigious bitch, Batman!   *sigh* Some people are just completely outside the box, and they'll never be able to find their way back in even with a neon sign pointing the way.   Overall, it was a good day today. The customer-service manager had a birthday today, and we all got cake. Any day in which cake is involved is automatically a GOOD DAY. Hooray for the miracle that is pastry!   Time to scrounge some dinner and call my mommy to make her jealous about my new toy. Nyah nyah a boo boo.

Major kudos to  urlLink Tuskudrusla  for the kick-ass blogskin (I can't understand a word of your blog, seeing as how it's in Icelandic, but I'm happy to link your page!).    &nbsp;  The amazing thing is, I don't know squat about HTML, but I have managed to teach myself enough to fake it. :)&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I did all this by myself. V.v. proud of me. **tooting my own horn** Meep-meep!    &nbsp;  Here's hoping for a wonderful Tuesday!!!

        urlLink It's my first Mambo!      &nbsp;   So let's get ourselves warmed up and dance, shall we, with a little "I say...You think..."     Magazine:    People     Photo:   camera    Concert:   music    Video:   killed the radio star    Pass:   backstage!    Ticket:   master    Line:   dance    Excitement:  fun!      Are you warmed up yet? That's good, cos the Mambo Guy is getting impatient. He wants to get his mambo going on. So let's get started.     1. If you had backstages passes to the show of your chosing, who would it be, and what would you do once you were backstage? (Try to be clean.)&nbsp;  B  ackstage with The Cure, and I would ask Robert Smith who does his makeup!     2. What entertainment magazines do you read?    People, US Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone     3. Do you read concert/album reviews in your local newspaper? And if so, do you let the review sway your opinion on the band/album?   No, because the main reviewer of our city's newspaper never really has something nice to say about anyone except for Lucinda Williams.    4. Create your dream concert lineup. (a sort of Lollapalooza event of your making).   Oh, geez. There are millions. Jet, the Cure, Coldplay, the Eagles, the Steve Miller Band, Journey, Van Halen (Hagar, not Roth), Duran Duran, Def Leppard, Allison Moorer, Shelby Lynne, Aimee Mann...    5. If you could have attended any festival show at any time...From Woodstock on...which one would it have been, and why?   I wouldn't have minded going to Lilith Fair when it was still around, but I was too young at the time to go. Chicks rule!    I love to Mambo!!!!

       I found out today, via   urlLink  the Birmingham News   , that a friend of mine from high school is getting married in two weeks. And even though I have not spoken to this girl in almost five years, I am glad for her. But it made me think- why have so many of my past friendships been so easily disposable?  &nbsp;  The thing is, I broke off contact with all but one (Lisa) of my high school friends back in '99. My reason for that was a fight I had with one of my friends, who turned out not be such a good friend after all. And because she was closer to everyone who was in our little circle of pals from high school (they all went to UA together), I just stopped talking to everyone so I wouldn't have to deal with this particular girl again. No big loss, it turned out- no one ever tried to see why I stopped coming around, and I am sure they heard plenty from my ex-friend.  &nbsp;  The bride-elect I mentioned earlier had been a friend of mine since the 8th grade. We had an on-again, off-again friendship throughout high school, which was on again our senior year. But the funny thing was, it was never really a friendship in the way a friendship should be. It was always me making plans, me calling her, me going to see her... never the other way around. There was no reciprocation on her part, or if there was, it was half-hearted at best. But I liked hanging out with her, and we had some good times. In the back of my mind, I always felt she didn't value our friendship like I did. But I&nbsp;stuck around, because I was reluctant to forget someone I had known for so long. You'll stick with anything long enough if you know there's security and continuity there.  &nbsp;  The last time I saw her was the summer of '99. The ex-friend and I went to her house and stayed up all night watching scary movies with her boyfriend at the time (who I think is the guy she is marrying [same name], and if he is, then way to go).  &nbsp;  I have good memories of times we spent together. I remember us going to Tannehill on a field trip with another friend of ours, and out of nowhere, we just decided to climb a "mountain" (a really, really steep, rocky hill, probably about&nbsp;40-50 feet high). None of us were athletic by any stretch of the imagination. We were slipping and sliding and laughing our asses off, and just having fun. We helped each other, and all three of us made it up that damn mountain. And we did it again the next year, just to prove we could.  &nbsp;  I remember eating lunch with her every day for four years- we always had the same lunch period. I remember mediating between her and another girl when they both fell for the same guy senior year. I remember sharing crushes on various guys, after-school job horror stories, and college application nightmares.  &nbsp;  I remember the bad times. We fought, like clockwork, once a year for several weeks at a time. We wouldn't speak, wouldn't even look at each other. But we always made up, and I'd like to think that we finally  grew  up, when we made it through our entire senior year without issue.  &nbsp;  I'm glad that she seems to have found her happiness. I'm jealous that I still have not found my own. I'm sad I don't know her now. All I know about her life right now is what fits in a wedding announcement in the Sunday paper. I'm sorry I never kept in touch. I wish I knew her now, to see what she's like, and to see if we would still be friends after all these years. Probably not. But&nbsp;I still wonder.  &nbsp;  The thing is, even if I could go back and change things, I don't think I would. Everything that has happened to me has happened for a reason. It's changed me, it's made me grow, it's given me purpose. I am a different person than I was five years ago. And I will continue to grow, and I'll be a different person when I see her at the reunion in three years.  &nbsp;  I am finally starting to accept the person that I have become. I am starting to like myself. I am intelligent. I am funny- in a really goofy, kinda stupid way. I am creative. I am unpredictable. I'm loud, I'm emotional, I'm bitchy, I'm temperamental, I'm thoughtful. I am a mental depository of useless, trivial knowledge that makes me a  Jeopardy!  ace. I'm always learning and&nbsp;I'm curious about everything (some people would call that "nosiness"). I am not afraid to state my opinion. I&nbsp;will fight for what I want. I like to take care of people. I give the best head rubs in the galaxy. I am, potentially, a GREAT human being.  &nbsp;  I have a good family that&nbsp;loves me- even though it sometimes may not feel that way, I know they will be there for me if dire need ever arose. I have the best friend in the entire universe, who doesn't even  know  how great she is- she's like ten of everybody else. She showed me what real friendship is. And I have a really decent job for now, something that will provide for me, and a boss who most of the time treats me like family and makes sure that I am taken care of as long as I am taking care of his company.  &nbsp;  Of course, there are things about myself I don't like. But I am always trying, and I am always working on myself. Maybe I have a rose-colored view of myself at this point. Maybe I am just seeing what I want to see. But when I catalog my good points to myself, they far outweigh the bad. That means I am on the right track. I know myself better than anyone, and I also know better than anyone else what my weak points are and how to improve them.  &nbsp;  It's funny how something so innocuous as a wedding announcement can send your mind hurtling back through time to relive your memories and reevaluate yourself. But... it's a rainy Sunday afternoon, and it's a perfect time to be reflecting on my past.  &nbsp;  Now it's time to focus on my future.

       I'm hopping on my soapbox.     urlLink See   Exhibit A.     &nbsp;   And all I can think is:     &nbsp;   1. This means more interviews with Shelby and Matt Lauer on  Today , which are  excruciating  at best and reinforce all stereotypes about the slow mentality and sheer idiocy of those who reside in our fair state (could they not have hired the man a speaking coach?- he's been on the Hill long enough to have earned one by now- and I don't know anyone from around here that actually talks like he does  ). Geez. When I first found out he was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee a&nbsp;few years ago, I thought for a moment that everyone on the Senate floor was smoking crack to allow such a thing [on a side note- does one actually  smoke  crack? I need to ask Cracky on Monday.] Someone who sounds that damn stupid is a bad reflection on us all, in my humble opinion- especially when he's supposed to be representing   intelligence   .  Why can't the man give a cohesive, coherent interview?!?!?     &nbsp;   2.   This is a man who used to be a Democrat, who switched sides ten years after first being elected to Congress- he actually switched sides only ONE DAY after the Republicans took control of Congress in '94. His reason? He claims the Democratic Party "left him and his followers behind," or some such garbage. But because this state is made up of mostly Republicans, he's been elected back twice since (or three times, maybe- I've lost count). Personally, I've never quite believed his sudden conversion to Republican ideology after being a Democrat for so long, and to me, it stunk of a political ploy&nbsp;(I remember talking about this in high school and being absolutely revolted by either his blatant re-election strategy... or his crappy timing). I didn't believe him then, and I don't really believe any claims of innocence now.     &nbsp;   3. Although, in his defense (how distasteful it just felt to type those words), he IS a Southerner, and therefore is blessed, or cursed- depends on how you look at it- with the "gossip gene." If it's in his blood, you can't really blame the man for wanting to share secrets. That's why Southerners do not make good CIA operatives.     &nbsp;   I just sincerely hope he doesn't turn into another Howell Heflin. We don't need any more panty-head-mopping politicians making everyone in the country think we're even more backwards than they already do.     &nbsp;   And now I'll be hopping down.

         You are the Fool card. The Fool fearlessly begins the journey into the unknown. To do this, he does not regard the world he knows as firm and fixed. He has a seemingly reckless disregard for obstacles. In the Ryder-Waite deck, he is seen stepping off a cliff with his gaze on the sky, and a rainbow is there to catch him. In order to explore and expand, one must disregard convention and conformity. Those in the throes of convention look at the unconventional, non-conformist personality and think What a fool. They lack the point of view to understand The Fool's actions. But The Fool has roots in tradition as one who is closest to the spirit world. In many tribal cultures, those born with strange and unusual character traits were held in awe. Shamans were people who could see visions and go on journeys that we now label hallucinations and schizophrenia. Those with physical differences had experience and knowledge that the average person could not understand. The Fool is God. The number of the card is zero, which when drawn is a perfect circle. This circle represents both emptiness and infinity. The Fool is not shackled by mountains and valleys or by his physical body. He does not accept the appearance of cliff and air as being distinct or real.

       I have always thought that the environment I work in, rife as it is with drama, comedy, heartache, anger, and foolishness, would make a great basis for a dramedy/sitcom.  &nbsp;  Case in point: the following memo was passed around the office on Thursday (and believe it or not, this is a serious problem at my workplace):     &nbsp;   "ATTENTION ALL NASTY FOLKS:  &nbsp;  Alright, now this seems a little ridiculous to have to pass out a memo telling y'all how not to be completely disgusting, but...  &nbsp;  Apparently some of you are wiping boogers on walls and any place else you feel like it. I don't have to tell  MOST  of you how revolting this is. If you feel the need to pick your nose instead of using a tissue, and something's on your finger, get a tissue, wipe it on yourself, EAT IT for all we care, but  DO NOT  wipe it on the walls of the bathroom, breakroom, or anywhere else like a five-year-old would.  &nbsp;  Now, this doesn't apply to everyone because I know that not everyone that works here is a  nasty, nose-pickin' maggot , so I apologize for subjecting you all to this issue, but at least now you know that there are  TACKY, NASTY, CLASSLESS, DISGUSTING PEOPLE  among us, so WATCH OUT FOR THEM!  &nbsp;  Management."     &nbsp;   This memo was actually my fault. Not through any booger-picking. I told Posh (who moonlights as our company's janitor) that I was getting sick of seeing the boogers all over the bathroom wall, and there was one on the break room wall that I noticed while I was eating my lunch yesterday (the boogers are up so high on the wall, it's like someone had decided to flick them and try to beat their own record or something). So she and Chili Dog came up with the memo and dispersed it to everyone, and poor Posh had to scrape all the boogers off the wall last night (which she technically should have done way before now because they had been up there for quite a while). But she forgot the one in the break room, and I saw it again today whilst eating my sesame chicken from China Ya (oh, yum).  &nbsp;  [By the way, it may just be me, but every time I eat sesame chicken, I always get&nbsp;a little giggly, and a teensy bit guilty, because&nbsp;the  stupid  part of my brain&nbsp;will always associate "sesame chicken" with Big Bird on Sesame Street. But then I get over it because: 1. Big Bird is a puppet, duh, and 2. even if they did fricassee him, cotton and fake feathers would not taste as good under a sesame glaze as the "chicken" (i.e. dog) they fry up instead. :)]  &nbsp;  Moving on.  &nbsp;  Today was a lazy day. No one wanted to work. I have not had the best week, but at least it's over now. Another chapter in my life at the company down. Another to be written next week. Maybe one NOT so dramatic. Maybe I can actually have a good week next week.  &nbsp;  And maybe I can take off under my own power and sail the skies.  &nbsp;  Speaking of sailing the skies: my brother Nick is in Texas for a month. He flew there by himself- his first time on a plane ever. He got an internship at&nbsp;some art studio that does computer animation and he'll be there for a few weeks. I found out by calling my mother's cell phone this evening looking for her:  &nbsp;  *ring*  Nick: "Yeah?"  Me: "Nick?"  Nick: "Yeah."  Me: "What the hell are you doing with Mom's cell phone?"  Nick (sounding pissed): "I'm in Texas! This is long distance! Call her at home!" *click*  &nbsp;  So I called my mom, who was watching  Jeopardy!  with Daddy, and she laughed and explained what was going on, and said she gave Nick her phone in case of an emergency. Then we stayed on the phone and played along, and I got Final Jeopardy! right, and she got it half-right (which is good for Mom, since she doesn't know shit about Shakespeare), and Dad didn't have a clue (hee hee).     &nbsp;   Category: Shakespeare  Question (or Answer- however you look at it): Two of the four Shakespeare plays in which a ghost appears.  My answer: What are  Hamlet  and  Macbeth ?  Mom's answer: What are  Romeo & Juliet  and  Julius Caesar ?  &nbsp;  The correct answers:  Hamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar,  &  Richard III.  (for the record- I knew all but  Richard III ). :)-       &nbsp;   And of course Mr. Smarty-Pants got it right, and he set a new one-day record of $75,000, and he gets to come back in eight weeks after all the tournaments are over. 38 straight days. What a way to make a living. He'll never have to haul manure, or whatever he does 9-5, ever again.  &nbsp;  Lucky bastard.  &nbsp;  I am going to spend tomorrow cleaning and sprucing up the joint, and then Sunday I am going over to my parents' house to have some quality time with Lucy the Amazing Yapping Yorkie- oh yeah, and my mom and dad too.  &nbsp;  All is pretty good. I'm just moving right along down the track. Choo choo.

        Whatever has been started over the last month can now begin to take root and become more solid. This is partly about shining the light on your own accomplishments and allowing others to see what you've done. This doesn't mean that you'll need to give up the security of what you already have. You will, however, need to find balance between your home and your professional world.      Yeah, we'll see.     &nbsp;   Had a talk with Jefe yesterday. Let's just say we came to an understanding. His understanding is that I am an ungrateful twit sometimes. My understanding is that he is a colossal ass sometimes. Now we can work in harmony.     And I have learned not to speak casually with Barbie about workplace ethics. She told Posh I wasn't feeling "appreciated," and of course, Posh couldn't wait to share that with Jefe, who was pissed because, admittedly, after a lot of the stuff he's done for me over the years, I should be grateful. And I am. But he has a way of making me feel lower than dirt sometimes.    &nbsp;  It doesn't say much about my character that I keep coming back for more.

       *the ones without common sense OR common decency.  &nbsp;   Die, construction workers, die.     &nbsp;   I'm with Lisa- I did not sign up for this shit. All the fucking construction going on here at the apartment is driving me out of my mind. It's like living in a GD third-world country. I swear, it looks like a tornado hit and left debris lying all over the place. These construction guys don't pick up their shit. Case in point: I get home at 6:30 tonight. I pull up and notice that no one is parked in front of our building. I think, "Cool! I'll park up front." Then I realize- no, the dumbass construction workers, knowing that people come home between 5-7 every day, have their fucking shit lying EVERYWHERE and orange extension cords are lying around so you can't park without landing on one. So I call out to this guy working a sawhorse, "Can you move your cord so I can park?" because there is literally NOWHERE to park. And the guy- who is an older white gentleman, so he does not have the excuse of being a dumbass Mexican day laborer who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with 10 other families and does not speak a word of English- sorry, I had to get that out- looks at me like I'm speaking fucking Russian and just goes back to what he's doing. Ooookay. So I get pissed and I park right on top of his GD extension cord. Then he deigns to look at me&nbsp;and yell, "Do you mind not parking on that cord?" So I yell back, "Do YOU mind MOVING the cord so I can park my car here, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE. I mean, I just LIVE here." And he very snottily moved the cord, and I very snottily tried to run over his fat foot. Oops. My bad. :)     &nbsp;   They touch my car, they are fucking dead.     &nbsp;   And when I get inside, I have another surprise. They had cut off the power today, AND they left a note saying that Alabama Power is going to cut it off b/t 9 and 3 tomorrow and their only sop to us RENT-PAYERS is "Oh, don't open your fridge." Yeah. I know some apartment bitches who are going to be replacing a lot of Atkins meat if they don't get their shit together.     &nbsp;   And the noise, noise, noise, noise, noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't handle all the noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   I so seriously did not sign up for this shit. "Construction crackhouse" was NOT one of the community perks listed in the Apartment Guidebook.     &nbsp;   And I'm not even going to discuss how I feel about work these days. I have enough on my plate dealing with asshole day laborers.     &nbsp;   There needs to be an Unkymood for ENRAGED. She could have steam coming out of her ears and a look of pure, unadulterated rage on her face. That's what I'm seeing right now when I look in the mirror, anyway.     &nbsp;   Happy place... gotta find my happy place...

       You've set out on a path that you've chosen for yourself, but now the test is seeing if you can stay on the road you've taken.  You'll probably need a mid-course correction. The more open you are to change, the better chance you have of making the most of what's going on.  Don't be afraid of talking about your process. It can help more than you may realize.   &nbsp;  Que apropriado. The stars seem to have realigned themselves as of late.

       I am so excited. I found the purse that matches my new wallet on Ebay today and I won it. I'm all a-twitter with excitement.    &nbsp;  I have become an Ebay addict. I have won nine items in the past 10 days. It's like a sickness. I can't stop. I keep finding the coolest shit ever.    &nbsp;  And now I need a matching contact lens case. Maybe an eyeglass case. And the cosmetics bag...    &nbsp;  It's been an interesting day so far.&nbsp; And because I'm bored, I'm gonna describe it in detail. Fun, huh?    &nbsp;  It started with waking up bathed in a horrible sweat wondering why the hell it was so damn hot. Come to find out, none of the vents were blowing out any cold air. So I called Lisa in a panic trying to get the maintenance #, and when she didn't call back right away, I looked it up myself (which is probably what I should have done in the first place- oh, well, they don't call it "hindsight" for nothing). Turns out the outside a/c thingy was malfunctioning, probably due to a careless construction worker fucking up something he shouldn't have been fucking with. So Maintenance Dude fixed it and replaced the a/c filter. Now I'm all content (and Lisa, it's only 70 in here, I swear).     &nbsp;  I went to Bruno's this morning... well, I tried to. My damn car wouldn't start. The battery is somehow drained. So I called my dad because, hey, that's what I do when something happens to the car, so he can come fix it. Only he didn't  want  to come fix it, and in fact seemed perturbed and maybe even offended that I had&nbsp;called him. Oooookay. So with a bunch of greasy Mexican construction workers looking on, I got back in the car and just kept cranking with the gas pedal to the floor. And after a couple of minutes, the engine caught and I was able to get across the street to the store. Then it cranked fine when I got back in to come home. [BTW, roomie: four packages of Ramen noodles, two cans of REAL Spaghettios, one package of Jell-O brand chocolate pudding, and a pint of cherry vanilla Blue Bell await you when you come home. Never say I don't take care of you.&nbsp; :)]    &nbsp;  Anyway, so I noticed that the ducks were under Lisa's window, so I opened it and- thanks to the fact that our pretty new windows do not have screens- I was able to feed the ducks about a half a loaf of bread.&nbsp;It was so funny. I kept pitching it out into the lake and they would swim so fast to get it and their little butts would shake and they'd go diving under the water, and one of them kept cheating and was actually flying over to the bread and pissing off the other ducks. And sometimes, a huge turtle would pop up and beat them to the bread and I could tell they were kind of frustrated by that, too. It was so cute, I spent an hour feeding them. Very calming to watch animals, especially birds. I don't know why. Probably because they're so damn adorable.    &nbsp;  Then I decided to go to CVS and pick up a shower curtain liner so I could fix my bathroom again. And again, I had the trouble starting the car, but once I got it cranked it ran fine. But I was in the store longer than I thought I would be (they had Tresemme on sale!), and I had left my windows down, and... dammit, I wish it would stop fucking raining all the damn time. My driver's seat was soaked and when I got home and got out of the car, it looked like I had totally pissed all over myself.     &nbsp;  But I did get my bathroom cleaned and fixed, and all seems good with the world now. Another benefit to keeping myself pretty well occupied today? I haven't been noshing. I had Poptarts for breakfast, and I am just now sitting down to hot dogs and cheese for dinner. I love being too busy/preoccupied to eat. That's when I start to lose weight.    &nbsp;  I started re-reading  The Search , by Iris Johansen, today. It's one of my favorites of hers. I gave it to Lisa since she finished  The Killing Game  last week. I've been telling her for years that Iris kicks ass. I think she's starting to realize.    &nbsp;  Books I am looking forward to this fall:  Blind Alley,  the next book in Iris' Eve Duncan series, which is going to be   excellent   from the plot twist I think is coming (I can't talk about it because Lisa would have my ass),&nbsp;and  Little Earthquakes,  the newest book by Jennifer Weiner, whose books I adore. And I think they both come out the same day, interestingly enough.    &nbsp;  I think I'm going to take a nap, and then watch  Some Like it Hot  on TCM tonight. I lurve that movie. :)    &nbsp;  Toodles.

       I'm probably going to end up at Montevallo.     &nbsp;   Reasons:     &nbsp;   1. I need my job. I may not like it somedays, but they take care of me. I need the security. And sometimes I realize that I will never find a boss like Jefe who understands my needs and my quirks (i.e. my selfishness and my neuroticism).    2. It would be cheaper because I would save on an out-of-state tuition fee. More money for play.   3. Montevallo has a journalism program. MUW does not. And the English program is great.    4. I can stay with Lisa until the apartment lease is up, then move into a dorm/my own place. Ever since I moved back in, we've come to an understanding. And I think we're able to keep each other sane for the most part (besides, live-in homework help is always nice).    5. I can be near Mama and Daddy. V.v. important.    6. My daddy wants me to stay here (this revelation came during the most productive conversation we've had in years).     &nbsp;   Besides, what it all boils down to is this. I'm going back to school. I only have two years to go. At least I'm doing something productive with my life and my time, instead of living beneath my potential and moving from one dead-end job to another every month. I am so much better than that. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   And in other news:     &nbsp;   Jefe asked me if I would be willing to sign a waiver to give him permission to call me "Ashehole." He thinks he's so clever (that was Nick's nickname when he played football). I probably will let him. It is kinda funny. At least he wouldn't be calling me "Chili Dog"&nbsp;like another girl.    &nbsp;  And I am getting my Gazelle freestyle machine!!!!!!!! I made a deal with Jefe and he's gonna order it for me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Teehee. Things are sweet.

       Daily Horoscope:    &nbsp;  You might be thinking about what you are really worth -- and I don't mean in dollars. It's about valuing what you do.  You may be uncertain about how much value others place on your work. Now, something can happen to make you realize that others don't necessarily know what you really do and that they cannot properly judge your contribution.  What's most important now is not what others think about you; it's about what you believe about yourself.   &nbsp; Talk about being a day late and a dollar short. Where were the stars yesterday when I really could have used this??? &nbsp; Everyone in this state forgets how to drive when it rains. It's not as though everyone really knows how to drive under ordinary circumstances anyway, but when it rains, it's like, "Oh, no! It's wet and cold and slick! I think I'll drive 5 miles an hour in the left lane and piss everyone else off!" or "Wow! It's like a Slip-n-Slide! Let me drive faster and swerve into other lanes, careening at top speed!" &nbsp; Needless to say, I did not enjoy my drive home, even though I made good time. It only took me about 30 minutes to get home, which on 280 traffic is unusual even in nice weather. &nbsp; I spent the day wishing for 5:00. Now I will spend the weekend wishing I could stay at home for a month and recuperate. That job takes what little sanity I have and spreads it thin. &nbsp; I think I will spend part of the day tomorrow at Books-a-Million. I love that place. :) Books are balm to my weary soul. &nbsp; I must be tired. That was almost profound.

       How wicked cool is    the fact that now I can blog    in living color?     &nbsp;   Ooooooooooooo.     &nbsp;   What a day it's been.    Much better than yesterday-    but&nbsp;still cliff-worthy.     &nbsp;   I'm tired of serializing my blogs. I can come up with a title every day. I think. And if not, I can cop out and just cut out titles altogether.   &nbsp; Jefe pisses me off. He is so far up Barbie's ass&nbsp;right now, I fear he'll never see daylight again. He gave her a "special" parking space all her own&nbsp;with her name on it because she had a good month last month.&nbsp;One good month out of the fourteen she's been&nbsp;employed. Come on. &nbsp; But what really pissed me off was his assertion that she had a better month than I did. I told&nbsp;him that was bullshit and he said he can't measure my performance because I do something different than everyone else. I&nbsp;handle only the return calls, not the first-time callers, and I&nbsp;generate&nbsp;70% of the accounts that&nbsp;open in the company per month. I keep track of these totals because he claims to be a "numbers" man. He ignores my numbers. &nbsp; He and Posh have been sucking up to her all month. The bad thing is, I am&nbsp;much more consistent than she is, even though that's not saying much, and I have  never  gotten the public gratification they are heaping on her. Any reward I get has to be kept&nbsp;"quiet" so people don't get&nbsp;jealous. Well, they are certainly not being "quiet"&nbsp;in regards to Barbie's rewards. &nbsp; Why am I so bitter?&nbsp;I got a raise last month. &nbsp; But she got a bonus, and I didn't.  &nbsp; (Thanks for listening, Lisa... the rest of this rant just&nbsp;became&nbsp;unneccessary). &nbsp;  I really hate my job.   Those&nbsp;people suck major ass.   Come get me,&nbsp;karma.     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Daily Horoscope:   You welcome the surge of familiar feelings that rush into your life with the force of the North Atlantic Ocean returning to the Bay of Fundy. You've become a bit parched, like a cactus waiting for the spring rains.   What the fuck, Tuna Cowboy?   Thinking isn't going to give you the resolution you now seek. Logical analysis will only tend to confuse the real issues of the heart. Throw away the words. Listen to your feelings, for they'll keep you afloat.   Um. I know I'm a Cancer and all, but the water metaphors are drowning me.  Set to the tune of  Three Blind Mice :   MY CAR RUNS! MY CAR RUNS! IT RUNS GREAT! IT RUNS GREAT! I WAS ABLE TO RIDE WITH THE TOP DOWN AND NOT BE SCARED OF THE LAUGHING TOWN- MY CAR RUNS! MY CAR RUNS!   Best I can do on short notice.  But I'm happy. Can't you tell?

      I'm kind of blah today.  I just feel bored. I'm ready to get back in school and start getting back into academia again. I'm so bored, I keep running my mouth to Lisa about a mile a minute about nothing at all, and I think it's starting to piss her off a little, since she can't watch her  Animal Planet  while I'm jawing.  I just feel like I finally regained some purpose in my life, and school just can't start quickly enough. I'm restless, and that's a dangerous state of mind for me, because I become unpredictable and a little reckless when I have nothing better to do.  Lord, please don't let me screw this up. Give me something to occupy my time for the next month-plus.  Please????

      Daily Horoscope:  Even though you are a Crab, these days you might feel more like a fish out of water. Your life feels on the dry side and this isn't good news for you oceanic crustaceans. You like to feel the waters around you, but now things seem to be more in the realm of action than of feeling.   Think about the tides. They rise. They fall. Things change. The waters will return. In the meantime, do something that nurtures your soul and makes you feel better about yourself.    And THAT is why I'm spending the day with my mommy at Hallmark.  Very poetic. :)

      Anecdote for the Day (or just a cute story):  Today was shaping up to be a disappoint after yesterday. I was run ragged this morning because Posh did not show up until 12:30, and everyone was bombarding me with their shit. So when she came in, I snapped at her and she snapped back and we kinda had a tiff.  I took her aside before lunch and apologized, and explained that I was feeling stressed. Then at 1:30, she came in the office where I was sitting reading a book at my desk.  "Come with me! I have something that will make you smile."  Okay. So I follow her into customer service, and she points out the window... and I burst out laughing.  Rebel had overshot her parking space and had landed on the side of the hill, almost under the building, and could not get her car back onto terra firma.  I almost peed myself, it was so funny. As I told Jefe, "You always wished we had underground parking here..."

      Daily Horoscope:  Your emotions are stabilizing, but this isn't going to seem as secure as you'd like. Even if you do know what you are feeling, it's difficult to bring these feelings out into the open where they can impact the directional changes you are making.   It's as if you are heading in one direction, yet all the circumstances in your life are pulling you astray. You are not being pulled off track. You are exactly where you need to be at this time, even if you think you are working too hard.     I knew it!  I had a good day. I rarely have one of those- time to celebrate!  So that's my weak attempt at a haiku. But I did have an excellent day. I feel kinda giddy (Lisa, did you slip me some Celexa or something?) My boss loves me. My co-workers tolerate me, and I them. And I had some chocolate cake.  Take one more piece of my big ass, Dr. Atkins- it was so damn gooooooooooooooooooood.   Nyah, nyah, a boo boo.

      I said goodbye to Blondie today. *sniff*  She won't be back at work until I'm gone.  It's going to be weird without her there. I have to move to her desk now, so I can work the fax machine (which is only on her computer, and Jefe refuses to move it), since I am the only other person who knows how, and Posh won't move. So that puts me right next door to Crackhead.  Oh, joy. Oh, rapture.  In other news... I bought some of those Tylenol Cold Caplets, which are supposed to give you a "cold sensation" when you take them. I took some yesterday and again today. Got rid of my headache... did not give me a chill. So I'm bummed. But then again, I bought them on sale and I had a coupon, so it was no big loss.  Lisa- the neighbor dude who likes to run up your cell phone bill knocked on the door twice this weekend and once tonight. I don't answer the door, just so you know, in case he asks where the fuck you've been. :)  I think I'll start my diet next week. I'm already off the wagon. I had pizza for lunch. It was delish.   Bite me, Dr. Atkins. Take a big ole hunk of my fat ass.  (I feel a little guilty for cheating).  C'est la vie.

      Whew.  It took me almost three hours to figure out what classes I want to take come fall.  It's not that I'm wishy-washy; it's that every class I wanted to take conflicted time-wise with another one I wanted to take, and I had to compromise on a couple. But I am pretty sure I am set now. I'm taking 5 classes, so I can kind of ease my way back into things. The mistake I made my freshman year was signing up for 8 classes, including two required seminars, and I got so overwhelmed I had to drop one of them and take it in the spring. I want to make sure I can handle everything this time.  I'm taking a required junior composition course; although I only have 50 total credit hours (10 short of junior status), I have enough prerequisites that they will let me in anyway (and because of my *sniff* advanced age). I will also be taking two other English classes: English Lit of the 19th Century, and Adolescent/Children's Lit, which I  hope  will be as fun as it sounds. I am also taking the second half of Western Civ (I AP'ed out of the first half) and College Algebra, which will be my only required math class to graduate, and here's hoping I actually pass it this time (I took it freshman year and did not exactly fail, but I might as well have, seeing as how getting a D is making me have to take the damn class all over again). I am praying for a C. That's all I want. A frickin' C.  So, save the horrors of algebra, it will be a seemingly easy way to slip back into scholarly mode. Here's hoping.

      Thanks for signing me up for this, Millie-mom.    Daily Horoscope:  In the midst of difficult times, today can be uplifting as long as you don't buy into your own illusions or the illusions of others. You are wrestling these days with significant circumstances and you may feel the need to make important decisions. Keep your mind on the big picture. Pay attention to what's happening so you don't get confused about which thoughts are your own and which are coming from others.    I am  so  trying to keep my eye on the prize.  It excites me that I will be back in school in less than 2 months, and, I'll admit, it frightens me. A lot. I mean, I haven't had to write a paper (except for Lisa's, which were not all that taxing) in years. I'm scared I'll go back and realize that whatever analytical skills I had have evaporated into thin air.  When I start getting apprehensive, I start trying to convince myself that my life is not as empty as I thought it was. My self-confidence is undermined by my fear of failing a second time. I have to work to keep these thoughts out of my head and stick with the path I've started down.  Kind of like my whole dieting thing. But I started back on Atkins today. I'm determined to stick with it. I'm not worried about heart disease; as that damn doctor said in May, my heart's as "strong as an ox," even considering the fact that I'm overweight. It's just a matter of willpower for me.  So here's hoping- on both counts.

      I was wondering who the third would be, and now we know.  I'm so sad about Marlon Brando. :(  I loved him in  A Streetcar Named Desire . He was hot as a young guy. Like, really, really hot. With really, really nice arms and that black, black hair and that piercing stare and... damn, why'd he let himself go?  Anyway... I'm sad. First Tony Randall, who I adored, then Reagan, who admittedly wasn't the best actor but a pretty decent Prez, and now Brando.  I'm almost as sad as I was last summer when Katharine Hepburn died. Almost.  I don't care if anyone thinks   I'm   sad for being sad about all these people passing away. I'm a huge, huge classic movie fan, and it's sad to see them go.  They just don't make movies like they used to...  Moving on.  It's been a long two days while Posh was out, and now I have an inkling of how she feels when she has four people shouting questions at her all day, and Jefe making demands, and having to open deals and deal with the assholes that we normally get to pawn off on her. It was EXHAUSTING. I felt like I was being dragged in fifteen different directions for the past two days, and I can't believe I am about to say this, but I am so glad she is coming back on Tuesday. I can't take this anymore.  This prick called in today and gave Blondie a hard time, saying he was going to sue us for "harrassment." She didn't know how to handle it, so she hands it to me, so you know there's a smackdown coming. He proceeds to tell me that he has two of our reps on tape telling him we are paying off his bills, but- surprise, surprise- when I ask to hear it, it's "in his office" and not available for listening. It turns out he works as a bill collector so he knows what we do, yet he is bitching me out saying that we are harrassing him- even after I pointed out that we have NEVER called him, though he has called US three times in the past month, so if you want to talk harrassment... He then proceeds to call me... well, here's a transcript as best as I can remember:  Prick: "Look, you fucking bitch, I want your full name and position. You have to give it to me. It's the law." Me: "Um, I don't have to give you anything if you're being abusive to me." Prick: "I can call you a fucking cum-swallowing whore and you still have to tell me your fucking name and position." Me: "Um, okay." Silence. Prick: "So, what's your name, bitch?" Me: "If that works for you." Prick: "I said, 'what's your name?'" Me: "Brandie." Prick: "And your last name?" Me: "You don't need that. I'm the only Brandie that works here." Prick: "You have to give me your last name." Me: "Okay, um... Smith." Prick: "And what is your position there?" Me: "Representative." Prick: "Of what?" Me: "Of... the company you just called." Prick: "I asked for your position, you fucking bitch." Me: "This is not the military, sir. I am not required to state my name, rank, and serial number." Prick: "Is Brandie Smith your real name or your alias?" Me: "My what?" Prick: "Your alias. A fake name." Me: "I don't know what you mean by that. This is also not the CIA, sir."  And so on, and so forth, and bladdy-bladdy-blah.  So then he tells me I work for a company of liars, and then I told him I had been working there for five years and I know I have never heard someone lie to a customer but I have known many customers that don't understand plain English. Then he tells me the only reason I still work there is because I can't find a better job, which was funny (and sometimes SEEMS true, but in all honesty, I could find one if I actually got up off my ass and looked). I pointed out to him that he's one to talk since he works as a BILL COLLECTOR, which is one step up from cockroach in most people's opinions.  Then he asked me how I sleep at night, since I spend my life lying to customers, so I answered, "Tylenol PM."  Then he asked me how I could look myself in the mirror, and I told him I could see myself just fine, and furthermore I could feel good knowing that what I do for a living helps people live a better life, when all he does for a living is make people want to kill themselves because he badgers them to death when they can't pay their bills. Nyah nyah, a boo boo. :)-  Finally, he said I was stupid and had a low IQ, and that I was a "dumb shit." Which is all essentially the same thing. Duh. So I popped off with, "You know, sir, you're not hurting my feelings, no matter how hard you try. You know what? You seem really, really unhappy- do you know Jesus Christ?" He flipped out, saying, "You just broke the law! You can't talk about religion on the phone!" So I just sat there, and he said really snidely, "That shut you up, didn't it?" And I said, "No, sir, but if you're not saved, there's no need for me to waste my time talking about it. But I will pray for you." And that shut HIM up, for like 2 seconds (and as a sidebar, I do feel kinda bad for breaking out the religion talk, when I'm kinda not really all that into it myself, but I knew it would piss him off...).  So then he kept telling me to hang up on him, because he wanted to be able to report to my supervisor that I hung up on him, and I told him I would not give him the satisfaction, and after 28 minutes and 52 seconds he finally gave up and hung up on me.   Victory dance! *waves arms, shakes big ass*  I mean, I was able to respond with a perfectly sweet voice in a perfectly calm manner and throw back every bit of vitriolic diatribe he was throwing off at me with a smile and a cheery tone. And boy, did it piss him off.  And the sad thing is, he was at work when he was saying all this shit to me. I wish I knew what company he worked for- I'm sure they'd be mad as hell if they knew he was talking like that on company time.  He even asked me at one point, "So how many of your coworkers are standing behind you listening to your performance?" And I told him the truth: "None. See, we actually  work  at my company." Teehee.  I told Jefe about the conversation, and he laughed and said it was "great." He loves it when people act like dumbasses.  But I kinda wish I hadn't had to deal with it at all, even though I was able to hold my own and defend my company and not cuss him out, which is what I was dying to do. I would have rather let Posh handle it... after all, she's used to being called a "cum dumpster" and shit like that (another baaaaad call from a while back).  At least she'll be back on Monday. I'm tired of these crazy folks.  Moving forward... again...   I went to my crackhouse, a.k.a. the Hallmark store, today after work and bought myself a pretty new purse that has to be seen to be believed. It's a little over-the-top, but then, so am I!  Lisa's in Mobile this weekend, hopefully shaking off her funk and getting her grove on, and will come back bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, albeit sad that she had to leave (boohoo- at least you've found someone). I will be relaxing on the couch and contemplating the wisdom of Atkins this weekend.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone!

        With the Moon back in your sign for a couple of days, you may be holding onto more feelings than others realize. If you are acting out of fear, remember that much of your fear is based upon past experiences and not what's going on now.  If you can see what makes the present moment different from what has hurt you in the past, then you'll be able to free yourself from the effects of your emotional habits.          Working on it, tyvm.

        I can be a nightmare of the grandest kind    I can withhold like it's going out of style    I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen    And you've never met anyone who's as positive as I am sometimes       You see everything, you see every part    You see all my light and you love my dark    You dig everything of which I'm ashamed    There's not anything to which you can't relate    And you're still here       I blame everyone else, not my own partaking    My passive-aggressiveness can be devastating    I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known    And you've never met anyone who's as everything as I am sometimes       You see everything, you see every part    You see all my light and you love my dark    You dig everything of which I'm ashamed    There's not anything to which you can't relate    And you're still here       What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know    What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go       You see everything, you see every part    You see all my light and you love my dark    You dig everything of which I'm ashamed    There's not anything to which you can't relate    And you're still here       And you're still here    And you're still here...

      When Lisa starts comparing me to her ex-husband, it's time for me to shut up and move on.  The days are getting busier, and school is almost completely set up... just lacking a dorm room. Got all excited because the comptroller told me I'd be getting an almost $1000 refund from my financial aid... and then realized that they had not factored in room & board. So I'll end up paying a couple thousand, spread out over nine months.  I am seriously trying to figure out how I can establish residency in MS and save myself an out-of-state fee next year. Then I really would be getting a refund.  Moving on:  I can tell you two things I know for certain in this world:   1. The best way to get over your issues is to write them all out (case in point- the entry I previously entered here that I deleted because I no longer felt mad).      2. There is nothing like a good cry to detox your system from all the bad stuff you sometimes have to hold inside.   But I digress.  I still have so much left to do, including packing and fixing my car. The butterflies are still there. I can't stop being excited.  I'm off to clean and then to finish my cheesy romance novel in the bathtub. Sometimes I thank the Lord for Harlequin romance. Sometimes I just need to get away. At least in spirit, if not in actuality.

       It's Monday Mambo time!          I just love the dancing bear! :)    Music evokes many emotions in people and can affect your moods in many ways. That's the subject of this week's Music Mambo. So to get started let's do something a little wacky.       Using the letters E-M-O-T-I-O-N, tell us how music affects you on an emotional level. You can use song lyrics, poetry...anything you want. Oh and since there are so many vowels, the letters don't always have to be the first letter of the word. Just bold that letter...and have fun!      "Wh  e  n it rains, it pours and opens doors that flood the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry..." (Train, "When I Look to the Sky")      "  M  ake it mine, takin' time, forgotten, speak for me, silent plea, surrender... what did you say, it's okay... did you miss me?" (Shelby Lynne, "Dreamsome")      "  O  h, yeah, life goes on... long after the thrill of living is gone..." (John Mellencamp, "Jack &amp; Diane")      "S  t  ep out the front door like a ghost into the fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white, and in between the moon and you, angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right..." (Counting Crows, "Round Here")      "  I   go back to watchin' summer fade to fall, growing up too fast and I do recall wishing time would stop right in its tracks..." (Kenny Chesney, "I Go Back")      "Y  o  u were everything, everything, that I wanted... we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it, all of the memories so close to me just fade away... all this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending..." (Avril Lavigne, "My Happy Ending")      "  N  ow that I've met you, would you object to never seeing each other again?" (Aimee Mann, "Deathly")      Now are you ready to mambo? The bear is..that's for sure. This week, since we're on a mood/emotion theme, I'm going to list some moods and you tell us the song that makes you feel that way or makes you think of that emotion. Are you ready to mambo? Good, then let's get dancing!      Happy: "Who Wouldn't Want to Be Me?" by Keith Urban   Sad: "Hands to Heaven," by Breathe   Angry: "You Oughta Know," by Alanis Morissette   Amorous: "You Really Got a Hold on Me," Smokey Robinson   Dreamy: "Crazy for You," Madonna   Freaked: "Wise Up," Aimee Mann   Independent: "One-Way Ticket (Because I Can)," by LeAnn Rimes   Misunderstood: "I'll Break Before I Bend," Allison Moorer      Everybody mambo!

      So... sleepy... can't... keep... eyes... open...  I spent the entire day on the phone yawning. And I even went to bed at like 9 last night. But I had skipped dinner, and when Lisa started heating up ramen noodles, it was like a siren song. So I whipped up a couple of baking potatoes into skins-on mashed potatoes at 11:30. Scrummy.  I went to the Hut for lunch today ($4.00 buffet to go w/coupon- they should call it "a fuck-ton of food for real cheap"). I brought home a huge salad to eat for dinner... and left it sitting in the back of a co-worker's car, along with a couple of moving boxes. Damn. Luckily, Lisa and her new school pal ordered the Hut for dinner, and I can nosh. Bonus: the girls at work and I have been going to Pizza Hut for lunch at least once a week for the past couple of weeks, and today we earned a free visit. So I'll be eating there again one day this week. :)  I am working my ass off (literally) on that Gazelle.  I registered for my classes online today. I'll be taking three English classes:  Advanced Composition  (which is required, otherwise I would avoid it like the plague-  so  glad I A.P.ed out of freshman comp),  English Lit of the Early 19th Century  (Romantic poets!!!! Yippee!!!!), and  Adolescent/Children's Lit  (which I hope will be as fun as it sounds- plus it's 400 level, like the English lit, so it counts towards my major). I'll also be taking  Elementary French , which is four mornings a week and is taught by the same scary woman who taught Latin my freshman year (I really, really hope she does not remember me because I used to skip her classes all the time and I got C's both semesters). And finally, I'll be taking  General Psychology , which is also required. Groan.  The way my schedule is set up, my first class on Mon-Thurs is at 9, and on Friday is at 11. I can handle this. My mistake freshman year was 8:00 classes on Monday mornings. I will NEVER make that mistake again. Give me the extra hour to sleep.  Plus, I'll get at least an hour, in some cases two, between each class to do whatever, which is nice. And I'll be out by 3 every day. Which makes plenty of work time, and plenty of study time. I intend to be a Time Nazi and make sure I have enough to do everything. Another mistake of my past.  I got my own parking space at work. Shame I only get to use it for two weeks, especially when my car is broken down right now, but hell. I earned it. And the sign is, as Jefe was quick to mention, "Hello-Kitty-pink." Awww. How cute. :)  Work rant:  Some woman claims I said "fuck" to her on the phone today. Funny thing is, Jefe and Posh were standing next to my desk having a conversation at the time she said it said it, and they didn't hear a word. But as I told Jefe, I was upset not that she accused me of saying "fuck", but that I didn't have the pleasure of saying it to her for real.  I have slipped up twice on the phone before. Once, I was really trying to sell this guy and he was being really difficult and rude and all of a sudden, some woman broke into the conversation and "Just who the hell are you?" burst out of my mouth. Got sent home for that one. Got yelled at, too.  A couple of years after that incident, a guy told me on the phone that I just "didn't give a shit" about his problems. And without thinking, I said, "Well, it's not that I don't give a shit about your problems; I just don't think you do, or you'd have started with us by now." The customer thought it was funny and laughed (and did end up opening his account), but Jefe's Little Snitch (a.k.a. Chili Dog) was passing by and heard me say it, and ran into his office to tattle. Jefe was cool about it, and just told me not to cuss on the phones again. And I haven't. Although I've really, really wanted to at times.  I do have  some  restraint. I just don't always choose to exercise it.

       I spent $60.00 at Wal-Mart today.      Baaaaaaaad girl.      I got my ear re-pierced. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. Doesn't mean I'll be getting anything else pierced, either.      I finally found a hardcover first edition of Iris Johansen's  The Ugly Duckling . I have all of her thrillers in hardback now- first editions all- and I feel complete. Self-satisfaction and utter contentment for $5.50 plus shipping & handling? Ebay freaking rocks.      "Becky" moment of the day- Lisa and I were driving down I-459 headed for the library (to buy cheap used books) and I noticed the van in front of us had one of those "Choose life" license plates. So I asked Lisa, "I wonder if they make one for pro-choice people. Would it say, 'Choose death?'"      Lisa kinda glanced at me, and then she did "the voice." The one that lets me know I've yet again added something to the "Brandie's not-so-smart alter ego Becky's Pantheon of Stupid Questions and/or Phrases." And she says, "Would you like me to quote that?"      So I decided to beat her to the punch.      Becky doesn't like "the voice."      Anyway.      Another week at work, and then only one to go. Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!!! Very happy. I think I might even be nice to folks who call in.      Except for the Oscar-deserving customer who called me on Friday and said her excuse for not opening her account by her deadline was that she had been shot in a robbery along with seven other people and that her best friend, who had been with her, was killed. She called me crying and wailing and asking for more time because she had just gotten home from the hospital, and I said no problem. Posh listened to the call, and like me was a bit cynical. So when I got home, I Googled robbery/homicide in the woman's city for the day she said it happened... and nada. I seriously think she was full of crap. But, it's not my place to say. Maybe it really did happen.      Mmmm hmmm.    BTW:   urlLink  Photobucket    rocks. :)

       My father, brother, and I went to MS today to scout around. I put in a couple of applications and brought a couple home. I'll only have to work 20-25 hours a week, and I'll probably end up at Winn-Dixie. Which is fine- I worked there before, for all of two months, right before I started working at the current company.  My dad is happy I am going to be in school again. He keeps telling me he's proud that I made the decision myself, applied for everything myself, etc. We talked a lot about what I'm going to do, and family stuff, and then John and I watched a movie on my dad's portable DVD player (although we didn't finish it,  Die Another Day  was pretty decent).  All in all, it was a nice trip. We buzzed campus- there is a hella lot of construction going on because they are expanding, but everything I remember is still there (frankly, I'm surprised at just how much I do remember). Then Dad got hungry for steak as we started back, and we had to drive all the way to Tuscaloosa to find a decent one (at Buddy's, which is an Alabama fan's wet dream, what with all the tributes to the Bear).  I learned that my dad drives like a grandma on the interstate, which I guess is good since he hasn't gotten a ticket in years, but is a shame because he's got such a hot car (brand-new cherry-red Mustang- you just try and tell me that's not a midlife crisis car).  I also learned today that my cousin, who used to be a pilot for American Eagle, is now the pilot for the Auburn University athletic division, which means he flies Tommy Tuberville and his staff all over the country to wherever they need to go. Even though I hate airplanes, how cool is that job?  My fear of airplanes goes way back. I've never gotten on one, and I don't plan to any time soon. If that keeps me from experiencing certain things... that's regrettable, but my fear of the plane ride would ruin any trip I took anyway. My phobia really irritates my cousin- he's offered to take me up himself on my first plane ride, and when I decline, he gets insulted, like he thinks   I   think he'll kill me. It's not that I don't trust him. But if man were meant to fly, wouldn't God and/or natural selection have given us wings? I'm just saying...  Anyway. It's getting closer. Two more weeks and then I'm  gone .  Pfwing!

       My car would not start this morning. I think it's the starter. It's been giving me problems for a while, but now it's just dead. Lisa let me drive her car today, and everyone at work called me a pimp (Barbie told me to tell you your car is very much a "check-me-out-hoes" kind of car... I'm sure she meant that in the best possible way). My dad will look at it tomorrow, and then I may be paying another towing bill. Sigh.      And I can't register for my classes. My freaking PIN doesn't work.      I had to sit on the phone- at work, on my lunch break- for almost thirty minutes to get the damn number, and I get home today and it doesn't work. And because I kept trying it, the system has locked me out, so now I have to call tech support on Monday AND the registrar's office yet again to make sure the number is right. Grrrr.      My parents and I are driving to MS tomorrow so I can start looking for a part-time job and to see if there are any cheap but decent apartments. I hope they don't want to start early, but knowing my parents, they'll be knocking on the door at 8AM...      I said bye to Foxy today. It was her last day before taking off for maternity leave. She's due on the 16th. My day in the pool is the 17th. I told her to try to hold it in until then if necessary. :)      I am going to miss her, but we'll keep in touch, and I'll come visit baby Elijah.      I'm going to miss several people very much. But life goes on, and there's always the telephone. And there are several people I won't miss much at all (you hear me calling you, Crackhead?- she didn't bother to show up ALL WEEK). I can't wait to leave.      And I ordered a deluxe luxury foot spa from the incentives catalog at work. Hopefully it will be here before I go.      I'm just glad this week is over. Finally.

       I am no longer the black sheep of the family (sorry, John). I like being the slightly-tarnished silver child again.      My father is a strange, funny man. And I love him, even though his moods are more bipolar than mine. And no matter how mad he makes me, I still think I got relatively lucky in the dad department. He always comes through when I need him the most.      He is beside himself, because he is so happy that I am going back to school. He's almost more excited than I am. He wants me to ride with him to Mississippi this weekend and look at apartments, because he wants to get me one if we can find one near school that is not too expensive, IF dorm/room & board expenses turn out to be too much (I'll know tomorrow). He also wants to take me around to find a part-time job. He and my mother are going to help me move to MS in two weeks. They both keep calling me, reminding me to do this, and do that, and make sure I take this, and leave that (and my mother keeps trying to get me to leave my damn Gazelle here so she can play with it, because she's certain I won't have room for it- so I asked her if she wants a fat daughter forever, and she laid off).       I forgot how much my dad enjoys the whole school process. He likes to discuss classes and map out a plan- I think it came from his being forced to drop out of college when he was younger, because he had a family to support (my dad is actually very smart, but that's sometimes overshadowed by his tendency to be an asshole much of the time). He's not getting to do it much with my brothers; Nick's been taking art classes at community college for going on four years now, submitting work and waiting to get discovered. John's starting this fall but only taking two classes; he's trying to get his average up so he can get into Auburn. John wants to coach high school football and teach history. I think it's a good idea, but Daddy doesn't. He keeps pushing for John to go into physical therapy. He wants all three of us to be better than he was, not that there is anything AT ALL wrong with my parents. He secretly harbors the dream that one of us kids will provide for him in his old age. Plus, he wants to be able to brag.      That is something I think I have nipped in the bud, though. It used to bother the shit out of me that I would visit my dad at work, and people I did not know would come up to me and congratulate me on my latest achievement. It was flattering, I guess- I just get easily embarrassed and don't like it. So Daddy is under strict orders not to tell ANYONE in the family or any of his buddies that I am back in school. If anyone asks where I am, I got a job offer in MS. I don't want any naysayers, and my family is especially good at that.      Two weeks from today will be my last day at my job. I'll have to say farewell to Jefe, Posh, and the rest of the zany crew- most, if not all, of whom I will probably never see again. I have a few regrets, but I know this is all for the best. I wasn't meant to spend my life there, but I am grateful for the time I spent therein.      Moving forward... I'm thinking about pre-law. I'd be done with law school by the time I turn 30. That's not bad. It was my major before, and I can double it with English.      God bless government aid. And Stafford loans. And Pell Grants.       And God bless midnight brainstorms, without which I never would have decided that I should go back to where it all started and write a  different  ending this time.

       Daily Horoscope:       You Crabs can hold onto the past better than any other sign. This tenacity gives you a false sense of security. Now, however, you are being pulled quickly into the future. And about the past: you can't take it with you—at least, not all of it. You must choose your baggage carefully and let go of old anger and resentment that is no longer serving a purpose in your life.      I made my final decision today. I'm going to Mississippi in two weeks. :)      I am so excited, I think I'm going to vibrate off this chair. I'm wired, baby.      Baggage going with me: my own neuroses and an "antelope" to work them off with.      Baggage staying here: my job, my failures, and my crutches (family, Lisa, Jefe, etc.)      I'm doing it on my own. I'm so damn scared. But I am really, really excited. I can't wait to get back in class. I can't wait to get started on my life. I can't wait to NOT need anyone anymore.

       Cracky is back to not showing up to work. Grrrrrr.      Jefe is being an ass to Posh, which ordinarily makes me smile, but this time it is all too reminiscent of the ways he's treated me and there's a funny feeling tugging on me... oh, yeah. That's compassion. It's been too long since I've felt that, obviously.      I had a troll of a woman call me today. She called me and Posh both "country bumpkin whores." And a whole bunch of other names. I love it when they stop taking the meds long enough to call us and act like the fools they are.      And some bitch on Ebay is trying to give me the runaround. Hmmm. We'll see about that.       Mississippi is looking pretty good from here (God, did I just say that?).

      Another week has come and gone and it's time to get out our mambo shoes once again. This Mambo-er can't believe that it's August already. Where has the summer gone?Ah, but that's not the point... it's mambo time... time to get up and dance.  But first a little warm up. A little I say... You think... Musical style... I'm going to post 10 words... and you tell me what songs or bands these words make you think of.  jazz:  Miles Davis  white:  "White Christmas," the Bing Crosby version  goodbye:  Spice Girls (don't ask)  summer:  Alice Cooper ("School's out for summer")  avenue:  "Ocean Avenue" by Yellowcard  hungry:  "Hungry like the Wolf" by Duran Duran  blue:  "Blue Moon"  moon:  "Moon River," from  Breakfast at Tiffany's  (aww... I lurve that movie!)  fire:  "Ring of Fire," by Johnny Cash  bird:  "Free Bird," by Lynryd Skynyrd (I  am  from Alabama, after all)   Now it's time to get our mambo on....are you ready?  5 bands that you can't live without:  Def Leppard, Counting Crows, the Eagles, Steve Miller Band, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles   4 albums that are important to you:   Ray of Light  by Madonna;  Fields of Gold  by Sting;  August & Everything After  by Counting Crows; and  The Hardest Part  by Allison Moorer   3 of your favorite songs: " Brown-Eyed Girl" by Van Morrison; "Maybe I'm Amazed" by Paul McCartney; "At Last", by Etta James   2 albums that you've bought recently:   Recovering the Satellites  by Counting Crows (for a friend) and  The Stewart-Mayfield Project  (a local Birmingham band)   1 Band [or Artist] whose music has would be described as writing the soundtrack of your life:  Aimee Mann (especially the soundtrack to the movie  Magnolia) . Her lyrics are so poignant and true and full of gut-wrenching emotion.      Ok, chicos and chicas, get to mamboing any style you chose. (I prefer Italiano). Remember it doesn't have to be Monday to mambo. Mamboing is fun on any day you choose!!!

      So I get home today and there is a letter from the Dubya telling me that I have been awarded $8600 in student aid for this year. Omigod. That's more than I thought I would get. I am so torn. I really want to take advantage of this, but I want to stay here.  Now I have to see what Montevallo is willing to offer. I have to contact Financial Aid tomorrow and do a comparison. It might be better, considering I would save an out-of-state fee.  BTW: Jefe loved his tie and wants me to find another one. Oookay.

       I hate it when I lose the will to blog. I've just been too damn tired.      Maybe that's due to my sudden pregnancy.       The ladies at Burlington Coat Factory thought I was pregnant. Lisa said I look pregnant. So damn it, even though there's ZERO chance in hell that it is actually the case, I FEEL PREGNANT.  ANYBODY GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?         Grrrrrrrrrrr.    Updates:      Friday: handled work situation with Posh; back on speaking terms (she apologized for being a "c" word)      Saturday: hung out with my brother John (the one NOT in Texas, obviously), went to the arcade and shot some pool (won 1, lost 3), dragged him to Burlington- dodging those damn saleswomen who think I'm fucking knocked up (I really wanted to kick some cashier ass)- and spent almost $40.00 on baby paraphenalia for Stacked/Foxy's baby shower (Baby Snoopy theme), went to Books-A-Million where I learned that my Nintendo-generation brother does, in fact, know how to read and actually does it outside of a school setting (do  Residence Evil  books count as literature?- well, at least he's reading), and realized that my brother is turning into a replica of the man he most despises in this world- our father (John has some daddy issues- let's just say, my dad has not exactly treated John as he treated Nick or me, and John does have solid grounds to feel resentment).       Today: did contortions in the bathtub whilst Lisa gave me a pedicure (long story and not nearly as bad as it sounds), went to Foxy's baby shower out in the boondocks and invoked the name of the Lord ("Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ, just show us where your house of worship is!") when we could not find the church, proceeded to say "God damn" in said church (oops), had way too much chocolate candy and cake (pukesville), determined that I was one of the few people who seemed to actually follow Foxy's registry in buying my gifts (for the sake of cataloguing, Lisa and I got her a Baby Snoopy diaper bag, bowl &amp; matching spoon, rattle bottle, pacifiers, bib and burp cloth, teething ring, stuffed rattle toy, and baby grooming kit), got lost on the way home in the middle of Hicksville, where I was terrified that dirty redneck cannibals would get us, and was almost killed by Lisa's crazy tailgating on the interstate system when something I did (I forget what) made her crack up laughing.       Busier weekend than normal.      Now I just need sleep. Lots and lots of sleep. I am not looking forward to the week. Week one of new diet. Oh, joy. Oh, rapture.
