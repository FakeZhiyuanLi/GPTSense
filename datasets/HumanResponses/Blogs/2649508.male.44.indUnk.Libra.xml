						    While eating breakfast at Denny's I found myself watching an old timer eating by himself. He appeared to me to be rather lonely. Once he completed his meal he began writing a letter. This is the letter I imagined him writing.   Dearest Sedgwick:  In 87 years of friendship we have shared many adventures. Our friendship has survived two world wars, three divorces and countless other earth shattering events. From the sinking of the Titanic to the World Trade Center we saw it all. I cannot think of another human being who I would have chosen to share those years of friendship with.  Unfortunately, that friendship ended January 28, 2004 at 7:37 AM. I am no longer going to allow myself to share coffee or anything else with a cheap skinflint such as you.  Yesterday, at Denny's you used the same ruse for the umpteenth and final time. Upon finishing your meal you excused yourself and went outside for a smoke. Then as always you conveniently waited until I broke down and picked up the check yet again. Once more you promised to pay me back but I have yet to see one red cent. By my most current calculations you now owe me $197.82.  I forgave you for losing my first edition copy of John Steinbeck's East of Eden. I forgave you for ruining my autographed photograph of Lauren Bacall. I even forgave you for running off with my second wife Gertrude. (I couldn't stand her anyways.) However, I will not forgive or excuse your cheapness any longer.  Henceforth, this friendship is null and void until you pay me the sum of $197.82 which you now owe me; or until I am lonely enough to put up with your inability to open that wallet of yours again.   Sincerely,  Chester

						   Dad I hardly knew you You were just a dream to me Someone that I heard about  But who I had rarely seen I kept your picture in my dresser drawer I kept your memory in my heart Now the memories have begun to fade The years have torn them apart I have seen so many places I have felt so much sorrow Dad, why werenâ€™t you ever here To reassure me about tomorrow  The first time I fell in love I could have used some fatherly advice And when she finally broke my heart Some comfort would have been nice I spent so many lonely days In my room without a friend If only you had been around Instead of a memory on the wind We could have seen so many places We could have shared so many things You could have given me your wisdom And the comfort a father brings  Now, today I received a phone call From a very good friend of yours  He told me you had passed away For you cancer there was no cure But the saddest thing he said to me Was that he had never known That you had left three young children Behind in a broken home  Now his news has torn me up inside There is so much I would have said Now I would give anything If we had, had just one more day I would have told you all about my life My hopes, my dreams, my fears But most of all I would have said to you I loved you dad, Oh how much I loved you  D.S. Brueckner 1980

						   I am four again.  Lincoln Logs scattered about the dusty hardwood floor.  I am asleep, sock monkey clutched in my little hands. The bed has sheets with cowboys and indians chasing each other across them.  The window is open and a warm, spring breeze fills my room with the scent of my mothers rose garden.  I awake to the sound of purring. A young black and white cat has climbed thru the open window, curled up next to me and fallen asleep.   I named her Kitty and she was by my side for the next twelve years.  After Kitty died, I developed an allergy to cats and have remained catless since.   I still miss that cat.

						   Last Tuesday I began what I thought would be a simple process. The city in which I live requires cars parked on the street overnight to purchase a daily or yearly parking pass. I went to city hall and completed an application for a yearly parking pass, paid my twenty-four dollars and went home. Assuming the process was complete.  How wrong I was.  On Saturday I received a letter from the city telling me they could not issue the permit because my car had an outstanding citation. The letter went on to say that once the citation was taken care of my application would be processed. Nowhere, in the letter did it state what the citation was.   On Monday I called city hall to find out what the citation was and where I needed to go to take care of it. The drone that answered the phone informed me that they did not have that information available. I asked said drone if they did not have that information available how they knew there was an outstanding citation. Drone replied because we ran the plates through the DMV. Remaining calm I asked the drone why if they had run the plates through the DMV they could not give me the information. The drone's response, I would have to go to the DMV myself, they did not have that information available at city hall. Realizing I could spend the next year going around in circles with this drone I figured I would just go to the DMV and fix the problem.  Today I went to the DMV, which is always an uplifting experience. After waiting for two hours it was finally my turn. To my surprise the person who waited on me was actually human and ready to provide me with assistance. I explained the situation and he ran my plates to find out what the citation was. It turned out to be a parking ticket I had misplaced and forgot to pay. I asked him if he could tell me what city I had received the parking ticket in and you guessed it; it was in the city in which I live. Not only that but the drone who helped me at city hall was the same drone responsible for collecting fines on parking tickets. Not wanting to wade through the muck of city bureaucracy again I elected to pay the fine at the DMV and mail the receipt to city hall.   Hopefully I will receive my parking pass in a few days but I would not be surprised if my favorite drone finds another roadblock to prevent me from reaching parking paradise.

						   Colored in vibrant gold and reds, the leaf remains in place on its branch. The sole survivor of yesterday's spring. Why this leaf? What inner resolve has kept this leaf attached to the tree? Its brothers and sisters have all given up the ghost. They have fallen to the musty soil beneath the tree damp with winters rain. Some were crushed beneath the feet of children running through the yard, role playing on a Saturday afternoon. Some were pressed between the pages of a favorite book. A few were gathered into bouquets and presented to mothers by tiny children with dirty faces. But with tenacity this leaf remains alone in the sky clinging to its branch. A gentle reminder that all the creatures of creation have a spirit within them that embraces the beauty and joy of life.

						   My understanding of a prescription is as follows: you go to the doctor's, he or she decides that you need something stronger than an over the counter medication. The doctor completes and signs a form authorizing the pharmacist to release that medication to you the patient. End of story. Everyone is happy and goes about their lives. Right.  Wrong.  Today I took a prescription to the pharmacy to be filled. The form was signed and completed by my doctor. The medication is one that I take daily and have been taking for at least six months. I refill the prescription once a month.   I dropped off the prescription. The pharmacy said it would be ready in one hour. I returned in one hour to find they were unable to fill my prescription. Why you may ask? Because the insurance company requires the doctor's signature whenever the prescription changes. (My doctor had increased my dosage from 20 mg to 30 mg.) I explained to the pharmacist that the doctor had completed and signed the form which I given to him to have the prescription filled. Apparently said form does not meet the standards of the insurance company. They require another form to be faxed to the doctor, completed and signed by the doctor and faxed back to the insurance company. Of course, while all this is being explained it is 8:00 pm on Friday evening which means the doctor will not even see the form until Monday. There was nothing that could be said to corporate clone at the insurance company to get him to think outside of his manual that I am sure he was reading from. It was all very frustrating.   Fortunately the pharmacist understood my predicament and gave me some meds at the old dosage to hold me over until Monday when I can joust with the bureaucratic dragons once again.

						   God's children come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors. We all may stand on two legs and we may share the same basic DNA, but other than that we are as different as snow flakes in a blizzard. A common cause of depression and unhappiness in society today is conformation. We have been sold a bill of goods by the entertainment industry. It has become accepted that if we want to be as one with our brothers and sisters than we have to become them. We have to wear the same jeans. Drive the same car or at least a car that looks like their car. Eat at the same plastic fast food express that can be found on the same corner in every town. Drink the same coffee at the same cookie cut out coffee place that can be found on the same corner in every town.  Enough, already.  Nothing could be further from the truth. We do not have to march in lock step to be happy. We do not have to lose a sense of self in the tide pool of life. Through out history those names that are still remembered are those who thought outside the box. Those who questioned what was and asked what could be. Jesus, Buddha, Confucius, Einstein, Edison and others all ignored the status quo and pursued the unexpected.   We do not have to conform. Conforming will not be the magic pill that leads to happiness. Acceptance will not wash away our troubles and self doubts. By our very nature each of us is an island floating free on the sea of life. If we are lucky, every now and than we bump into other islands that we would like to know better. We might even build a bridge to connect our two islands and spend some time together. Maybe a day, a week or a lifetime.  It is time for us as individuals to embrace our differences. To proudly walk a path of our own creation. To rediscover our heart, our soul, our humanity.

						   When did the Civil War, one of the bloodiest moments in American history, become a celebration, or a picnic where modern Americans gather together to recreate their favorite Civil War moment. If Lincoln, Johnson, or Grant, are watching they must be moaning and rattling their chains like Jacob Marley. The Civil War was fought for many reasons. Millions of Americans died both soldiers and civilians. Many of those who died did not even understand the root causes of the war and what they were dying for. Even today over one hundred years later scholars are still debating the cause and effect of the war. What I don't understand is the desire to reenact the bloodiest battles of the war. What is the thrill in recreating each charge? What joy can be found in falling to the ground in the throes of a faked death? Why relive each and every bloody moment of a terrible war? When did war become a game? Why did we allow that to happen? When war becomes a game it deadens the reality of the cost. Society begins to slowly look at war as a strategic event and not a conflict that cost the lives of men, women and children. It especially cheapens the lives of those who die on the "other side". We forget that for each bomb dropped a child may have died or lost its mother. War sometimes is a necessary evil but we, as citizens have to remember to keep the genie in the bottle, has long as possible. We need to remember that once removed the genie is difficult to put back. Finally we must remember that even if our cause is just it can become shrouded in darkness if we are not careful.

						   Apparently, all of the worlds problems have been solved. Or at least they have been in the eyes of some professors at MIT. While watching the Food Network last night they had a show on kitchens of the future. Now I grew up believing that MIT was one of the universities in this country that great minds flocked to, too solve the great problems of our time. My how times have changed. The next big invention to come out of MIT will be.....the mixing spoon. That's right all the world apparently needs is a good old fashioned mixing spoon. Not just any mixing spoon, this spoon is electronic and can talk to your computer. It will tell your computer if your food is to salty, to bland, to sweet, to sour. It can tell you if the batter you are mixing is to thick or to thin. Now call me old fashioned but I have always felt that the most efficient way to test the flavor of your food was to taste it. With those taste bud that God, or mother nature, or evolution gave to you.

						   Emotions are scattered Into the wind The walls tremble And sometimes bend Like a magnet My soul collects The scattered remains That others forget Overly emotional My mood swings Go with the flow Though I canâ€™t sing I want to be calm Nerves on edge Talk me down From the ledge I cry out Torn in shame I know the rules But donâ€™t like the game Like a boy in the park Wanting to run Though the dark clouds Have hidden the sun I want to love But thereâ€™s so much confusion Will it last Or is it all illusion Another minute Has passed me by I stand-alone I donâ€™t know why My heart screams For some attention Nothing works No intervention I want to fight My soul is weak Iâ€™m so afraid Of the love I seek I want to laugh But I fear laughter If I disappear Will it matter I hope that someday Someone will understand My soul My heart And the feelings of a confused man

						   I chose this path. I am here at this point in 2004 for a reason. When I was born there were unlimited alternatives spread before me strewn upon life's many paths. Each selection I made brought me a step closer to the reality of here and now. Why? Why did I make these choices that have brought me here? How would my life be different if I had turned left instead of right, if I had walked rather than ran? I have no crystal ball to show me what might have been. Jacob Marley's ghost has not promised me a once in a lifetime journey through my past, present and future. The only reality I have is the one in which I am living. The only here is now. The choices I have made are made. I can accept them and move on into the great unknow. Or I can sit in the corner with my sock monkey and cry over all my past mistakes. Hopefully, I will choose to accept the future, but just in case if anyone finds a soggy sock monkey he belongs to me.

						   I sit and I watch The stars at night I think of what's wrong I think of what's right A war torn country A terrible sight Children who run From the dark to the light My heart is heavy With insignificant pain But what I feel Just isn't the same My problems are few Compared to theirs Someday it just seems Like it's so hard to care As I sit in the park On a merry go round Placed there for children To spin round and round I want to cry But I can't find the tears I want to run But the pain is always near To some love is the answer A light at darkest noon To me love is a fear That never leaves to soon Some can't understand That, emotions are real Not something tarnished Made from recycled steel I want to run Into the arms of a friend I want to hide Until time begins to bend I want to capture the moonlight Dancing on the waves I want to walk thru the sand A moment to save I want to live without questions No soiled explanations Talk to whom I please Without emotional citations I want to live in solitude Lost in a fantasy I want to sleep in the rain And escape reality I want to be a boy again No pressure to bear Playing with soldiers Dirt in my hair Riding a merry go round Singing a song Watching the moonlight And cryingâ€¦ Alone

						   She runs across the lawn, her golden hair dancing in the sunlight. The sound of winter leaves crunching beneath her tiny feet. Her shouts echo across the courtyard. Her laughter joins with the songs of nature in a joyful symphony. Just four year olds and her life is unfolding before her, no cares, no worries, just a soul filled with wonder. So easily amused. She spends a good fifteen minutes, chasing the shadow of my hand around the yard, trying to catch it. Laughing, falling, rolling in the grass. Jumping to her feet and trying again. Screaming, "I did it", at the top of her little lungs when she catches it. Before long she forgets the shadow tag and begins chasing the crows around the yard. Laughing and singing, lost in her own little world. Finally worn out she crawls onto my lap and whispers, "Daddy, I love you. Can we go home now?"

						   1962. I was two years old. We had just moved into a two bedroom rental. My mother, was painting and cleaning and chasing me around the house trying to keep me out of trouble. My father was working and drinking, drinking and working which is about all he ever did.   To keep me occupied my mother gave me a spilly cup filled with orange juice. I happily toddled around exploring my new surroundings. In a corner of the yard I found an old jar with a lid on it. I took the jar and the lid and returned to the porch. Some small part of my mind must have remembered watching my father mix drinks because I managed to remove the lid from the jar and the lid from my spilly cup. I mixed the contents and replaced the lid of the spilly cup.  Of course, after mixing my first drink I had to try it, which is where the trouble began. I had chosen to mix my oj with ant poison....What did I know I was only two. My guardian angel must have been paying extra special attention that day. Just as I slurped down the last of my cocktail, my mother came to check on me and realized what I had done. She grabbed and ran to the car, a convertible Cadillac, she left me there and ran in the house for her purse and keys.  What she failed to realize was that the keys were in the ignition. While she searched the house for them I was busy playing with my new rattle. Looking out the window, she saw me with the keys and came running for the car; just as I through the keys in the ivy. She franticly searched for them but they were gone.  So she grabbed me from the car and began running down the street in the general direction of the hospital. I cannot imagine what she was feeling by this point but I am sure that I had scared the shit out of her. My guardian angel must have still had his or her hand on me because she had barely run for a block when two teenagers pulled up and asked her if she needed help. She explained the situation and they got us to the hospital in record time.  There my stomach was pumped and I was placed in ICU for two days before I was sent home. Somehow though I managed to survive without any permanent damage. At least none that I know of.

						   Torn Between The smooth and the rough Feeling hurt But Haven't had enough Wanting to fight Feeling the strain Lost in the sorrow Hide from the pain Deep in the night The echoed screams You hear the words But not what they mean The silent madness Of a broken heart Tried to hard Lost at the start Drowning in tears And shallow thoughts You got what you wanted But not what you bought A cheap imitation  Of priceless art A bootleg copy Of a broken heart   In the morning light Sanity returns The minds at peace But the memory burns Trapped at 1/2 speed No master mix Forever copied Unable to fix

						   The crowd had all gathered To celebrate another year One step closer to manhood One step closer to fear The toys were all present Three candles on the cake We all sang happy birthday But the happiness was fake His mother and father now live apart And the boy is too young to understand The grandparents try to spoil him rotten More than the parents ever can His godparents could not be there So they sent him lots of money His uncle built his brand new swing And his aunt, she planned the party All the kids came to visit They ate up all the ice cream They played lots of birthday games Boy those kids could scream His great grandmother stood alone Complaining and full of sorrow She has never let happiness interfere She just worries about tomorrow His mother is trying Oh, so hard To be the strong single parent Though no matter how she tries Her feelings are transparent His father sits outside the circle Alone in an empty crowd Just watching, it hurts so bad He wants to cry out loudâ€¦  The boy he just keeps playing To him, itâ€™s just another day Laughing with his brand new toys Why canâ€™t innocence stay All to soon The days will change Another year older Nothings the same Maybe someday he will understand The confusion in this world Maybe someday he will fall in love With a pretty brown eyed girl And if he has his own child A beautiful baby boy I hope he can slow down And take the time to enjoy Because all to soon The dreams are gone The soul is empty We stand-alone To face the illusion Of our life The lost love The buried strife All to soon We die alone In a quiet town Without a phone Just a faded picture From long ago Of three small children We used to know  d.s. brueckner

						   To often it seems that in today's world some parents treat there children as if they were disposable. They pay more attention to their car, their game, their gossip, their job, anything but their children. My neighbor and I took our children to the park today. We each have two. Mine are 11 and 4. Hers are 8 and 10. Anyhow we were at the park for a few hours watching our kids play. In that time no less than two parents lost their kids and could not understand what had happened. In both cases the parents were with large groups of adults and were to busy to notice where their children had gone. Fortunately both children had just wandered off and were soon reunited with their parents.

						   Are you losing your hair Is your back to hairy Are your breasts to small Is your butt to big Are you to fat Are you to skinny Do you hate your face Do you hate your smile Just give us some money We can build a new you A new body A new face A new smile More hair What ever you want Your hearts desire Can be had for a price But when you look in the mirror Will there be a new you Will you be happy Will you be loved Will life be worth living Or will you find That beauty is skin deep And all those nights Spent crying in the dark It wasnâ€™t the exterior That filled you with dread It was the darkness you found Inside your head It was your soul That was warped By the pressure of now To be what the world Wanted you to be A smiley happy person With no thoughts of their own Following the crowd Off of the plastic cliff Where modern beauty Flounders In a tide of indifference Where the soul Has become  A spark of insignificance Left to fade In the shadows of dawn  d.s. brueckner 2003

						   I love to cook. My cookbook collection while small covers the entire food spectrum. Some are classics that have been in print for years, while others are fad books, which have yet to stand the test of time. My personal favorite is "The New Wolf in Chef's Clothing", written during a period where men were not expected to know how to cook at home unless they were burning steaks on the grill. Each recipe is portrayed through the use of pictures very few words are thrown into the mix. I have not learned much about cooking from this book but I have had many a laugh.  Most of my cooking is done from memory and by discovery. I have many memories of hours spent in my grandmother and mother's kitchen. Watching them prepare dishes from all over the world. I can recreate most of what I learned but my mother still makes the best-damned fried chicken on the planet. Cookbooks and cooking shows also provide me with inspiration, which I take into the kitchen to add my own sense of pizzazz.  Like most chef's I believe that I have more successes than failures. But when I do fail I fail spectacularly. Several years ago I came across a recipe that called for baking a corned beef rather than boiling it. I figured what the hay and gave it the old cooking school try. Basically the recipe called for the corned beef to receive several baths as it was cooking to wash away the salt. I followed the recipe to a "T" and what I created was on of the truly uneatable dishes of all time. It was horrid. So horrid that even our dog Shasta turned her nose up at it and actually whimpered and hid in the corner after one taste.

						   He found her heart sitting on a bench in Golden Gate Park. It was right where the one before him had left it. When he first saw it sitting there it was hardly recognizable. Somewhat tattered, its edges would be caught up in the breeze coming off of San Francisco Bay and for a moment it seemed it would soar away, a kite with nothing left to celebrate. As he drew closer he saw through the dust and neglect, he saw the beauty hidden beneath the pain. Within his chest he could feel his own heart crying out with primeval sorrow at the damage done to this unique and fragile flower. Upon reaching the bench he saw that her heart was trembling, crying tears of what could have been. He wanted to reach out to her but he was afraid that in this state her heart would turn to ash and the ashes would dance with the wind only to be scattered upon the rocks of Alcatrez. So, removing the bandages that protected his own abandoned heart he offered them to her. He gently, and with tender loving care wrapped her heart for her and placed it back into her weary hands. Smiling, she softly kissed his still tender heart. As she disappeared into the fog she left but one word behind, "maybe".

						   He never wanted to have another dog. After Muffett died and Muffett II was stolen he said enough was enough. But than George wondered into their world. He just showed up in their backyard one day and never left.  George was a mutt. Even the vet was not sure what breeds had contributed to his creation. What little hair he had was short, stiff and brown. He was not a large dog, he weighed about 25 pounds soaking wet. He would have never won a beauty contest or best of show but he was a warm and loving friend.  He wanted to send George away but the children would not have it and their mother agreed. So George became part of the family. No one ever saw him pet the dog, or call the dog, or even acknowledge the dog's existence. However, he never chased George away.   The two youngest children were especially close to George. They wrestled with him, chased him and he always slept at the end of one of their beds. It was as if he felt on obligation to protect them from things that go bump in the night.   As the children grew older George would follow them everywhere. It was as if he sensed that someday the children would leave and he did not want to miss out on a single moment.  One night the children went jogging and George followed. They had an argument, as kids often do, so they were running on opposite sides of the street. George was not one to take sides so he was running back and forth between the kids when a car hit him.  They brought him to the vet and he said there was little hope. He told the family that putting George to sleep might be the best choice. The children would have none of that and their mother agreed. So finally, against his better judgment he told the vet to save him. Several operations later George was allowed to come home.  For the first month George hardly ate or moved about the house. The children tried everything but George seemed to have lost the will to live.  He never really asked about George and seemed to be indifferent to his condition. However, one night he returned late from work and he thought he was the only one awake. Quietly, he opened a doggy bag and removed a large piece of prime rib. He methodically sliced the meat into small dog-sized pieces. He got down on the floor and began to hand feed the meat to George one bite at a time.   Following, that evening George began to improve. Before long he was out and about catching up on the latest happenings in the neighborhood. He was never as spry as is younger self but he still lived life to the fullest.  I never mentioned to my step dad that I had seen him feeding George. What I had witnessed though changed our relationship in a subtle way. I had always thought of my step dad as being cold and distant, someone without emotions. But after that night I realized that he had a warm and loving heart, he just was not comfortable enough to share that heart with the rest of the world.

						   In November her memory began to fade. The TV left on when she went to bed. A burner still lit on the stove when she had finished her meal. Keys left in the door when she returned from the store. It is nothing she thought, just old age beginning to catch up with me.  She sat in the front window, with the late afternoon sunlight streaming over her shoulder and warming her bones. On her lap sat a bible, King James version, which she tried to read when the day's work was done. Often she would find herself looking around, frowning, and trying to recall what it was she had just read. Returning to the page did not seem to help, as she was no longer able to recognize the simplest of words. So she returned the bible to the book shelf promising to try again tomorrow.  She continued to attend Wednesday meetings at her senior club but the conversations became increasingly frustrating. A friend would ask her about yesterday's events and her mind would draw a blank. She remembered her childhood, she even remembered driving from Missouri to California in 1926, just her and her best friend exploring the back roads of America. For the life of her though her memory of current activities was nonexistent, which filled her eyes with tears of despair. So she withdrew from the club and began spending her Wednesday afternoons at home, sitting in front of the television watching reruns of The Golden Girls.  What scared her the most was not recognizing the friends and family that she was closest to. One Sunday she went to mass with her oldest grandson. He took her to breakfast and to the grocery store and helped her put away her purchases. She was sitting with him on her back porch drinking coffee when suddenly she had no idea who he was. Why is this person on my porch? Who is he? Should I scream? Should I call the police? Before she could act on any of these wild ideas her memory came back into focus and she remembered whom he was. It did not happen everyday but when it did she had to use all of her composure to sit with the person and pretend like everything was just fine.  Her life was becoming a daily battle, she was fighting as hard as she could to hold on to her memories. It was a battle she found herself losing more often than naught. She mailed her payment to the gas company but forgot to enclose the check in the envelope. One morning she found her glasses on the butter dish in the refrigerator and had no recollection of putting them there. The money counters from her church called asking about her most recent donation. The envelope she had deposited was filled with tissue paper, in looking around her house she found the twenty-dollar bill she had meant to place in the collection box wadded up and thrown in the wastebasket.   Now each and every night before bed she struggled to hold on to her most precious memories. When she said her prayers she begged God to spare her the loss of her sense of self. Please Lord, she would cry, anything but that. However, being a Christian woman who had always placed complete faith in her creator she inevitably ended her prayers with a solemn "thy will be done."

						   I never knew her younger hands. The hands unscarred by life. When I was born her hands had already seen eighty-two years.  All the same they were beautiful hands. They represented all that she had seen and done in her lifetime. Each line, each wrinkle could tell a tale of a place visited, a road traveled or a home built.  Her nails were always neat, clean and trimmed. She never, ever wore nail polish. For, as she was fond of saying that is not how things were done in the old country.  Some of my first memories were of her hands at work. She was sitting in front of the fireplace her glasses perched upon the end of her nose. On her lap rested a skein or two of colorful yarn. In my young imagination she appeared to be a magician at work, her knitting needles her magic wands. What began, as a skein of yarn would before my eyes transform into a pair of socks, a scarf or a sweater.  I developed my love of cooking, especially Italian dishes, from watching her work in the kitchen. Everything she cooked she made from scratch and the food she prepared was seasoned with love. I can see her now with her sleeves rolled up, flour coating her arms to the elbow, while she gently kneaded the dough that she would bake into a savory loaf of bread.  My most treasured memories of her came from watching bedtime preparations. Her hands, those instruments of creation, would remove the pins from her white hair. When down her hair was in my mind as long as Rapunzel's. She would sit in front of her vanity and brush her hair with an antique silver brush; every night one hundred strokes no more no less. When she was finished her hair reflected the lamplight like the moon reflects the sun. Next she would open a bottle of her favorite cream, a gift from one of her son's, and she would rub it into the crack and wrinkles covering her wise hands.  Finally, she would kneel at the end of the bed. Her hands would come together, fingers intertwined; she would close her eyes and begin her evening prayers, in Latin. My sleep filled eyes would close and I would float away on the sound of those ancient words coming from her lips as she recited the Lord's Prayer.

						   ARMAGEDDON!!!  Armageddon had come to Southern California. A low-pressure system is stalled over the Pacific Ocean and is expected, "GASP", to bring rain to Los Angeles for the next three to four days.  I know, I know, those of you who live where there are real weather concerns fail to see the significance of this announcement. You may be digging yourself out from a blizzard. The river may be rising and the authorities may at this moment be imploring you to leave for higher ground. There may even be a tornado or a hurricane heading your way.  But this is Southern California the land of the Beach Boys, Baywatch and fun in the sun. People who live here pay their taxes expecting to see the sun 365 days per year. If there is even a threat of rain civilization as we know it comes to a standstill.  First of all every TV station goes on immediate storm watch. They break out their doplar radars and in hushed but serious tones announce that they are on STORM WATCH 2004. Even a single cloud is treated as if it were the precursor to the great flood. Cameramen and reporters are sent to locations through out the southland to report on the "storm". They have their heavy duty rain gear on even before the storm as arrived.  When and if a raindrop actually comes into contact with the ground the civilians freak out. Most of the drivers suddenly suffer a bad case of amnesia and forget how to drive. (Of course if you have ever driven here most drivers probably have very little skills to forget.) The freeways that surround the city become deadlocked. Nothing moves. Brake lights can be seen for miles. Commutes which normally take forty-five minutes take three-hours.   Basically life here becomes ugly, real ugly. Personally I would hate to see what would happen if a giant hand came out of the sky, picked up some Southern California natives and deposited them in the middle of New York City in the middle of a blizzard. They would probably curl up into little balls, put their thumbs in their mouths and cry for their mommies.

						   October 1975. I was sixteen years old and ready to conquer the world. Because I had a teenager's most important document: a driver's license.  Not that the world or one Temple City policeman thought I was ready to drive.  After wading through the DMV bureaucracy and passing my driving exams, my mother had me drop her off at work and let me have the car for the afternoon. I thought I was so cool. Cruising Huntington Drive in her '63 Valiant, complete with push buttons for changing gears. The stereo was cranked to KHJ and I was thinking about going to Bob's Beef Burgers for lunch.  Than, just as I was becoming comfortable with my newly found freedom I saw that ominous flashing light in my rear view mirror. I panicked. This had to be a record ten minutes of driving before I received my first ticket.  I began to review all of my driving lessons trying to understand what had gone wrong. My hands were at ten and two o'clock. I had used my blinker while turning at the previous intersection. My speed was okay. If anything I was probably overly cautious. Driving slower than the surrounding traffic just to be safe.   While conducting my review I forgot about the policeman until he rapped on my window to get my attention. I nervously rolled down the window.   He looked down at me and said with a smirk, "Son aren't you just a little bit to young to be joy riding in your parents car."  To young to drive, didn't he know I was free? I am sixteen with a driver's license the world is mine and I am ready to explore? Of course while thinking the above I actually said, "No sir. I just turned sixteen."  He actually laughed at me, "Come on son you couldn't be more than thirteen."  Now I was turning red. Thirteen, right. But I had an ace in the hole. Sitting on the seat next to me was my temporary drivers license. The ink still wet from the DMV clerk who stamped it. I wish I could say that I handed it to him with great drama and a memorable comeback but I didn't. Because my hands were shaking and the butterflies were trying to fight their way out of my stomach. So I meekly handed him my get out of jail card.  Now it was the officer who was turning red. He went over all the data with me and realized that I indeed was sixteen. He told me to drive safely and have a nice day. Without comment he handed me back my license.  On his way back to the patrol car I heard him muttering, "These damn driver's are getting younger everyday.

						   She sat on the floor Sifting through the remnants of her past Some years so full they overflowed with love Others so empty that she still felt their chill  She stumbled across wedding photos  Her own Buried in a box of memories With tear filled eyes her fingers searched For her favorite The one taken at sunset When he still looked at her that way What a couple they had once been So young and filled with promise But that was yesterday Now Today She wondered Where had they gone wrong When did they stray from the path Lost  Was the raging inferno That burned in her soul For that man Now her soul was cold Her heart was ash Her mind Was filled with the bitter taste Of sun filled days Of tequila nights Of a wedding day Of a gold ring inscribed "forever"  Now that ring  Was at the bottom of the Pacific Somewhere off  Of the Balboa Pier At the spot He embraced  The other woman Kissed her With the passion that once was hers  Before the ring even hit the water She was on the coast highway Peddle to the floor Wind drying her tears While Henley sang all about Wasted Time.  d.s. brueckner 2004

						   The soldier laid upon the ground a solitary witness to recent events. About him the earth had been torn and broken. Branches hung limply from nearby shrubs. Sound lay quiet upon the hill, nothing stirred. The dust had settled and the sun was slowly sinking in a blaze of glory.  The weary soldier had been left behind, hidden amongst the crevices of some large nearby rocks. He was unable to stand on the remnants of what once were his feet. Voiceless, he lay in solitude wishing someone would stumble upon him. As darkness lowered its veil he wondered what fate held in store.   Night settled and the crickets began to sing their evening song. In the distance a long mournful train whistle could be heard echoing through the canyons.   The moon rose and cast his resting place in an otherworldly glow. All about him shadows danced and shimmered bringing to mind visions of beasts that flocked like carrion to fields of blood. Glowing red eyes passed him, nose to the ground but none picked up his scent.   As the evening passed the mantle of time to morning, droplets of dew began to collect on his skin and clothing. Bringing the chill of predawn. The soldier patiently waited upon the damp grown for the sun to rise and bring the warmth of a new day.   Gently he was lifted from his resting place and cradled by loving hands. In moments he was returned to a plastic box where is brethren awaited his return. He was home. Stored away to await tomorrow's imaginary battle.

						   She once believed it was better To be alone In a world full of strangers Standing against the highest tide Protecting her heart From loves danger She wondered if it was better To cry alone at night In a darkened room Than to believe In old fairy tales And fall in love to soon She thought she would rather face The night  Alone with a bottle of beer Than listen to another man Spin a tale she couldn't bear Many times she played the fool Losing her heart  To big blue eyes Her "friends" all thought What a sorry state Their disgust they would not disguise But she kept on trying And the tears Just seemed to fall Her phone was filled With cobwebs No one bothered to call Thus the final nail Was driven in Her heart began to bleed She found that love was lost Doubt  Had planted its seed She just wanted To lay down and die But she didn't know how She contemplated Suicide It did not matter anyhow Her heart was cold and frozen Her eyes Were forever dry She tried so hard To forget the pain Caused by all their lies  So to the end She stands alone Defiant to the last Even though  She forgot her lines She still belonged to the cast  d.s. brueckner 2004

						   Have you ever noticed how the people around you clap when you are at a concert or special event? I have, and I have come to realize that clapping styles can be distinctive and vary from individual to individual.  For example: a person who attends events out of a sense of obligation and with no interest or desire in the proceedings tends to clap very slowly with long pauses between each slap of the hand. This type of clap can also be used to display sarcasm. After a speech for instance, the clapper may acknowledge the speakers words with a slow drawn out clap. Kind of like the opposition party at a state of the union address.  A person who is warm and reaches out to others will clap enthusiastically for each and every performance. Their hands will create a staccato beat with the slapping of their palms. They use their applause to reach out to the performer or speaker and embrace them with their clapping hands.  Some people tend to clap with distraction. They never have a real rhythm to their clapping and the beat of their palms will change from super slow to fast without rhyme or reason. This tends to be the same person who does not stand for an ovation while everyone around them is on their feet.  Then there is the proper clapper. Hands arranged just so. The beat is never to fast or to slow. They conduct their clapping without much enthusiasm but with an obvious sense of obligation. They clap the way they pay their taxes on time and without much relish.  I am sure there are some types that I am missing. When they come to mind I will add them to this list. There is also a second theory I have that an individuals form of clapping can say a lot about how well they make love but that one is wee bit harder to investigate.

						   My grandfather by definition was a member of a strong but silent group. One of those men who were born at or around the turn of the century and who never shed a tear or raised their voice. I can only remember one occasion in which his emotions got the best of him.  It was 1975 and I had just turned sixteen. I was working part-time at a local steakhouse, The Cask and Cleaver. I was a bus boy, which paid decent money and included tips. As a bonus for some extra work I had done I received a gift card from one of the manager's for two free dinners.  My grandmother's birthday was in December, which coincidently was when I received the card. I decided taking my grandmother to dinner would be a great birthday present. I was the oldest of thirteen grandchildren so this was the first time one of us had the means to take her out to dinner or anyplace else for that matter. She was very excited. She had her hair done that morning and she was dressed in her Sunday best. She even wore make up which was rare for her. I picked her up in my '63 Valiant and with the smile on her face you would have thought I was picking her up in a chauffer driven Roll's.   Our arrival at the restaurant was memorable. The manager, Tony, happened to be near the door and he greeted her like she was royalty. He took her arm, introduced her to the staff and gave her a tour of the dining room and kitchen. He personally sat us at our table and provided her with a complimentary bottle of wine. Which he opened and poured for her. My grandmother was a very down to earth person and she was not used to this kind of treatment. But the smile on her face told the story and she ate all of the attention up.  She had filet mignon with lobster. Accompanied by a baked potato with the works and an artichoke. She made several trips to the salad bar making sure to try each item at least once. Of course since I was underage she finished the entire bottle of wine herself. When she had finished eating, Tony had not only our section but the staff and the entire restaurant sing Happy Birthday to her. The smile that lit her face would have lit up the entire city of Arcadia for a month.   On the way home she went on and on about her evening. She kept the empty wine bottle and displayed it prominently on her mantle for years after. As I drove off she waved and thanked me again for the best birthday celebration she could remember.  I arrived home to the ringing of the phone. My mother answered and handed me the receiver. At first I was unable to recognize the voice. After a moments hesitation I realized it was my grandfather. I had not recognized him because he was choked up and I am quite sure shedding a few tears. He said he was calling to thank me for showing my grandmother such a wonderful evening. In his words he had not seen her this happy in years. Still choking up he thanked me yet again and said three words that I had never heard him say nor would I hear them again from his lips before he passed way. I love you.

						   Summer 1981  The Intensive Care Unit was a cold and sterile room. It was large and square with several beds and a nurse's station. Rather than brightening the room the fluorescent lighting gave everything a sickly pallor. Several chairs were scattered about for those awaiting the news.  I was there because my brother had recently been in a motorcycle accident.  He had lacerations, broken bones and a ruptured spleen but he would survive. He was lucky. He was always lucky. He was in numerous accidents and he always came out of them alive. I sat with my mother who handled these moments very well. She has always been a pillar of strength at times like this. As my brother was resting comfortably my thoughts and attention began to wander around the room.  The bed nearest the door was empty and naked. A mountain of sheets and blankets were folded and piled on the mattress. They were cleaned, pressed and awaiting there next mission. Even the floor around the bed was clean. No discarded weapons of medicine scattered about after another life saving battle.  An elderly gentleman occupied bed number two. He was pale and gasping for air. A lifeline of oxygen ran from a gray metal tank to his ancient nostrils but appeared to provide no respite for him. He did not appear to have the strength to survive ten more minutes no less the entire evening. Even so his eyes were bright and he had a quiet dignity about him. His wife sat next to him, a silent sentinel clutching his hand. Her love filled eyes blinking back the tears.  Several people surrounded bed number three. The group appeared to be in a state of shock. They were pale and huddled together like a sÃ©ance of ghosts. They whispered to each other, cried softly and did their best to preserve the peace of the room.  On the bed lay a woman no more than thirty years old. Her hair fell lifeless and dull around her head. Her face was pasty and her breathing was shallow. Her skin seemed to be translucent; I could almost see the blood slowly coursing its way through her veins.  As I watched the life seemed to leak from her body. I did not hear anything out of the ordinary. I did not see her spirit leave. However, just before she died I sensed (for lack of a better word) her soul leaving her body behind. Before the monitors erupted to life I knew she was dead.  Suddenly, the room had shrunk to the size of an old phone booth. My heart was racing and my lungs were struggling like a newborn for air. I felt like I was going to pass out. As I fled the room I was followed by the shrill alarm of the heart monitor and cries of sorrow coming from her bed.  After regaining my composure I returned to the ICU and my mother told me that the woman had passed away. Listening to the family my mother found out that she had recently given birth and developed a post delivery infection that went undiagnosed until it was to late. As we left that evening I imagined her spirit hovering above her bed in confusion wondering what had gone wrong.

						   How old is old? What is the definition of age? In an astronomical sense the only definition of age or time for that matter is the orbit of our planet around our sun. Someone who has achieved fifty years has seen the earth complete fifty orbits of the sun. Does that make them old? We have an obsession with age in our society. This obsession rears its ugly head in many areas from advertising to movies you are either to young, to old, or just right. Which brings me to my rant on the subject of aging; age differences in couples.  If a man is dating a younger woman (by younger I am referring to ten years or more) no one blinks an eye. It is commonly accepted through out society. His friends all look up to him and they all secretly envy him. He is player. He is hip. He is sexy. Jack Nicholson, Hugh Hefner, Bruce Willis, Jerry Buss are all out there without a word of criticism.   However if an older woman is dating a younger man we tell a different story. She is robbing the cradle. She is making a statement. She is desperately holding on to her youth. No one seems to envy her. No high fives. No acceptance. No support. Nothing.  Why the double standard?  I am not sure where the double standard came from. I only bring up the subject because two women I know and respect are dating or about to date younger men. One is ten years older; the other is thirteen years older than the man. They both have already received advice from friends and family concerning the "mistakes" they are making. Each in their own way is having second thoughts not because of how they feel but because of peer pressure.  Frankly, everyone should mind his or her own damned business. It is hard enough to find happiness in today's world without undue pressure from those around us. People say that love is blind. In a way it is. When our heart falls in love it does not consider age, beauty, wealth, or anything else. The hearts only consideration is love, the love radiating from another soul and its own. It is when our minds and especially our ears get involved that love goes wrong. When we listen to everyone else's opinion and ignore our own heart. When we rationalize and analyze and twist into knots what our hearts feel. When love becomes a confusing maze rather than a path that two souls decide to travel for a while.  My advice to my friends, fly with your hearts and enjoy the ride.

						   My stepfather was born in 1928 and raised in Texas. Two lessons that he took to heart from his childhood were racism and what he felt defined a man. His views on race changed long before he died. He learned to accept his fellow man for who he was and not to judge them by their race or creed. However his definition of manhood never wavered.  We did not always see eye to eye. I respected and loved him but I did not always accept what he said as gospel. His definition of manhood was not complicated, fix your own car, pay your own way and never under any circumstances should you show your emotions to the world or for that matter even to your own family.   He used to tell his friends that I would cry at the drop of a hat. He would than drop the hat to prove it. Sadly, more times than not I would end up crying because I hated it when he teased me. I never took his teasing well. He would tease. I would cry, which only led to his teasing me more.  It used to bother me, but now as an adult I can better understand where he was coming from. Teasing was the only emotional tool he could use to show he cared. He could not come right out and say I Love You. It was not in his blood, he was not built that way. In a way his emotions were stuck in 4th grade mode. Where kids tease their friends and family to show they care. He just did not know any better.  As for myself I was and I still am an emotional being. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cry. I cried when Old Yeller died. I cry at weddings and I cry at funerals. I have cried in movie theaters and I have cried to myself while reading a good book. I cried when my heart was broken and I cried when my children were born. I have never hid my emotions and I never will. I wear my tears with pride.

						   I am suffering from a severe case of writers block today. While I sat and stared at this monitor, my mind just wandered off. I looked for it everywhere but have been unable to locate the scoundrel. While I continue the search, I figured I would take the easy way out with today's post. The following, in no particular order, are ten movies that have real watchability for me. Not all of them are classics, but all are movies I can lose myself in. For good measure I tacked on four holiday movies that I can also lose myself in.  To Kill a Mockingbird A Tree Grows in Brooklyn The Big Chill To Have and Have Not Bringing Up Baby The Thin Man Mary Poppins Going My Way Independence Day Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Original)  Nightmare Before Christmas It's a Wonderful Life A Christmas Story A Christmas Carol (Alistor Sim)

						   Over the course of my life I can remember two instances of dreams that I revisited over several evenings. Each dream was triggered by specific events in my life.  The first instance happened when I was about seven years old. While playing at my grandmother's I was bitten by a black widow. Several hours passed before I or anyone else realized what had happened. That evening I was sleeping when my mother came into check on me. She found my arm swollen several times its normal size. She took me to the ER, where my arm was lanced and the poison removed. Upon testing they realized that I had been bitten by a black widow.  About a week later I had a dream where I was laying in bed asleep. I opened my eyes and found that my room had become filled with spiders. The walls and ceiling were an undulating mass of legs and fangs. There was no escape as even the door was covered. At that moment the realization came to me that this army of spiders had already devoured my family and I was next on the menu. I shut my eyes and when I opened them I saw that the light fixture was covered by a large black widow the size of a beach ball. As I looked on in shock its large glowing red eyes stared right at me. Than by some unseen signal they all began lowering themselves by their webs towards my bed eyes wide with hunger. At that point I always woke up screaming.  The second instance occurred when I was thirteen years old. My grandfather had recently passed away after a long illness. His passing was my first real exposure to death.  About two weeks after his funeral I began having the following dream. I found myself sitting in a railroad car. The train appeared to be traveling across the old west. There were several people in the car none of whom I recognized. In the center of the car was a coffin. Everyone kind of looked at each other but none of us looked into the coffin. A few nights later I had the same dream. Only this time there was one less person in the car. It took until the third appearance of this dream for my dream self to gather the courage to look into the coffin. Sure enough the person missing from the group was the person in the coffin.  For about a month after that night I had a very bad case of insomnia. I somehow convinced myself that if I kept having this dream the night would come when I was in the coffin and that when that occurred I would fail to wake up. Fortunately for my sanity I came to a somewhat reluctant acceptance of death before sleep deprivation drove me insane.

						   I have come to the realization that I am suffering from an incurable case of mind pollution. No, not because of the unannounced appearance of Janet Jackson's breast on the halftime show, but because of all the clutter I cannot seem to discard. The dÃ©cor of my mind has more and more become a mismatched collection of old and useless memories. If only I could have a mind sale and make a profit from my personal scrap heap.  As I wander around the jungle that is my ego I am continuously discovering archaic ideas and outdated memories. Some of the memories may be worth keeping but for the most part they should have been taped over long ago. There are snippets of songs without titles. There are bits of dialogue without film. There are even pages of books with long forgotten plot lines.   Further back in the darker recesses of my mind lies a toxic waste dump. Filled with the tattered remains of broken hearts that can be seen clinging to the cerebrum like bats in a damp and musty cave.  Here also can be found pools of pain and sorrow, collected and stored, a reservoir of half remembered tears.  If only God had thought about providing me with an alt-control-delete button so I could reboot my system and start over. Maybe something a bit more practical a memory scrubber of some type that I could use to remove the garbage, open a few windows and air out the place.   Of course if I could do that I would quickly run out of material to write about. All in all I guess this imperfect storage system is one that I will have to live with. I will continue to blindly tour the halls of my mind hoping to find my way beyond the mind pollution.

						   Growing up I was fortunate enough to have two mentors who picked me up and deposited me onto the road of imagination. They opened my eyes to the magic of reading and planted the seed, which eventually grew into the desire to put my own thoughts and dreams onto a blank page.  The first of these mentors was my mother. When I completed first grade I had done well enough in every subject but reading. Reading was my Mount Everest an obstacle that had proved daunting in my initial attempt requiring my return to base camp. The summer after first grade was the worst but most rewarding of my life. Every morning my mother sat me down for four to five hours and drilled me on phonics lesson after phonics lesson. I would cry, scream, beg and complain but her commitment to teaching me never wavered. She patiently sat with me day after day, drying my tears, calming my nerves and planting the seeds. Amazingly, half way through that summer something clicked, the seeds blossomed and began to bear fruit. My rebellion ceased and I began to enjoy the lessons and became eager to apply them to my every day world. We moved on from phonics, to Dick and Jane, to Dr. Seuss and beyond. By the end of that summer I could be found at the breakfast table with the local paper checking the standings to see how my beloved Dodger's were doing.   Thanks Mom.   I never new the name of my second mentor, if I did I have since forgotten it. She was a librarian at Live Oak Library in Arcadia, California. This was the library of my childhood. I spent many hours browsing the stacks in search of new adventures, new friends, and new lands to lose myself in. By the time I reached the fifth grade I had read all of the books in the children's section and my wandering eyes began to drift towards the adult section. One day the above-mentioned librarian discovered me browsing and promptly walked me back to the children's section. Upon my next visit I headed right back to the adult section. The same librarian discovered me but this time she sat down and asked me what was wrong with the children's section. I explained to her that I had read all of those books and that I needed something new to read. At first she did not believe me and she went and checked the cards. To her surprise she found that I had indeed read most if not all of the age appropriate books. So she made a deal with me. She said if I allowed her to help me pick out books that I could read all of the adult books I wanted. She smiled at me and we shook on it.    Thanks to librarians everywhere.

						   He was sitting on a broken, graffiti covered bench, a bible clutched in his hand. He was discussing God with everyone though no one stopped to listen. It was preaching to the indifferent but preaching just the same.  He wore a torn and tattered t-shirt, which may have been blue once upon a time, with the words Jesus Saves written in a childish scrawl across the back. His jeans were tattered and had been patched so many times that little of the original material remained. They ended two inches short of his sock less ankles exposing dirty skin and the scars of countless mosquito bites. Old-fashioned canvas deck shoes covered his feet, the laces were missing, and the tongues flopped about like the tongues on two old hound dogs.  He had a tattoo on one arm, a cross with a crown of thorns on the top and a serpent wrapped around the base. Where the other arm should have been was an empty sleeve a reminder of the price he paid in some forgotten war. His hair was a tangled mess, a rat's nest of twigs and leaves. His nose had been broken once and leaned to the right like an old weathered picket fence. His remaining teeth were yellowed from years of chewing tobacco and smoking cigarettes.  That being said it was his eyes that captured an observer's attention. They were a deep soul searching blue. Lit by the roaring fire of his faith, they seemed to cry out to passing crowd "I may be down but I have yet to be beaten."

						   Silence is no longer golden. We as a society are no longer capable of being alone with our thoughts. Wherever we go in life; our ears are bombarded with conflicting levels of sound. From car engines to sirens, from talking heads to loud music all are contributors to the surrounding noise pollution.   As I write this I am standing in the courtyard of the Paseo de Colorado, an outdoor mall located in Pasadena, California. In my immediate field of view are three restaurants and a movie theater. Each facility is broadcasting its own unique soundtrack competing for our attention by attempting to show how hip they are. However, the waves of sound emitting from each establishment have merged together into an indecipherable level of electronic pollution. If by some fluke, an actual song bleeds through the noise, the vocals are still lost in the surrounding babble. Even everyone's favorite past time of eves dropping on the juiciest of conversations becomes impossible as the best parts fade into the background.  What are we afraid of?  What thoughts are hidden behind these sonic vibrations?  Has it come to the point where we are so afraid of solitude that we have to clothe our loneliness in the artificial sounds of society?   It seems to me that now more than ever silence is as rare as and more precious than gold.

						   In preschool and grammar school friendship falls into our laps. In the sandbox or on the swings, sharing a dump truck or a doll common ground is found. Parents meet, exchange numbers and invitations to birthday parties and slumber parties are soon to follow.  Has we age and reach our teen years the social pool has been diluted. The class of thirty that we knew fairly well has been absorbed into a larger class of five to six hundred. Friends that we have know since pre-school may not even attend the same high school. Old friends fade into the mist as new friendship develop from the fertile soil of athletics, scholastics and hormones.   Before much time as past college appears on the horizon. New friends and old are scattered across the country by the winds of change. New paths are chosen. New directions are found. Some relationships have survived the turmoil from preschool thru college. Others may be new but a strong foundation has been built.  Graduation and promotions, marriage and children, all of life's responsibilities become part of our essence. Marriage and parenting bring new friends and new circles. Some of the old have drifted away. Finding new circles to swim in. If we are lucky a few of the classics have survived. They have aged like a fine wine. Meant to be savored and appreciated.  As we move to new neighborhoods, transfer to new offices or begin second careers with new corporations the friendship cycle changes once again. Something is different though. The pool is no longer expanding but shrinking. New friends appear to be mere acquaintances. They are great for lunch, a movie, office gossip but the closeness that developed with relative ease through schools and careers has become more complicated. Everyone already seems to have a "best friend". The two o'clock in the morning the world is ending I need someone to talk to type of friend.    Those of us who have that "best friend" are blessed. We have made it through three or four decades with somebody who shares memories and history with us. That in and of itself is a precious gift and one we should embrace wholeheartedly.

						   "You are a slob. Wait until you are older no girl will even look at you."  "You are so lazy."  "You are fat."  "You are so stupid."  How can she not see his tear filled eyes and the pain their words have caused him. How can she repeat the errors of the previous generation and treat him the way she was treated.   Her mother had always used words as weapons hurling them at the three siblings. She could remember hiding in the closet or under the bed anywhere to escape the pain of those barbs. Words are powerful though they are like time bombs. She thought she had avoided most of the damage but she was well into her thirties and still found herself crying in her sleep. She no longer lived with her mother but the potency of her mothers words crossed telephone lines could still cut her deep.  Yet, what she hated most about her mother she inflicted upon her only son. When brought to her attention she always brushed off the concerns of others.  "They're only words", she would mutter.   "He knows I love him," she would explain.  All the more reason for her to understand the power love gives to our words. The words of a stranger can be easily brushed off. There is no emotional investment. The words of a loved one however are filled with meaning. How can he at ten separate the wheat from the chaff. She calls him stupid, or fat, or lazy but doesn't mean it. How can he not become confused when she than says I love you and means it.   Lacking understanding he searches for the true meaning behind her words but only finds himself lost in tears of confusion and frustration.

						   There used to be conversation. Discussion. A decision needed to be made and they sat down and discussed their options like two mature adults. Sometimes one would compromise, sometimes the other. Somehow they always found their way to the middle ground where they could both accept the resolution to the problem.  No more. What used to be quiet conversation in the bedroom or around the kitchen table had regressed into territorial battles. Where had it gone wrong? Why had communication faded into the woodwork? Could they ever regain that early gift they had of mature teamwork?  Or were they doomed to one of "those" marriages where they stayed together out of comfort and not passion. Where the children were the only thing left that they held in common.  He for one was not sure. In the quieter moments, late at night he would often find himself pacing the downstairs searching for a solution to their stalemate. If he was completely honest he could even pinpoint the origin of the impasse. It was his fault, because of his irrational obsession that required him to make the entire planet happy regardless of the cost to himself. As their marriage aged he found himself compromising more and more to keep the peace. He would agree rather than fight in front of the children. At first the compromises were over little things. What color to paint a wall, how to arrange the living room furniture.  The consequences of those compromises developed over time. His wife began to understand that if she started an argument she would usually get her way. In the beginning she was careful to pick and choose the times that she would break out her secret weapon. After awhile though she through caution to the wind and began to pick fights to have everything her way. She did not see it as manipulation. She saw nothing wrong. If her husband wanted to keep the peace by sacrificing his desires who was she to stop him.  For him the problem became apparent when the children reached school age. The disagreements intensified as came to the realization that their ideas concerning education were as different as night and day. He understood that while the education system was bruised and battered with parent participation it still worked. She on the other hand wand to toss out the baby with the bathwater and home school the children. He had no problem with home schooling if the parents had the ability to create an environment that stimulated the child's ability to learn. The problem was that he worked full time and he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that his wife did not have wherewithal to maintain the proper classroom. The issue appeared to be black and white someone would have to give in.  So it had finally happened a line had been drawn in the sand and all that was left was to see who would blink first. She was adamant about home schooling he was adamant about his children receiving a proper education. This is the straw that would break the camels back. He could give in and forever surrender his ability to voice his opinion or he could make a stand. Praying all the while that it would not be his last.

						   So far I have kept my posts link free. That being said all rules are made to be broken and the following link made breaking this unwritten one more than worth it.   urlLink Ghost Town   is a site belonging to a Russian woman named Elena. Apparently her favorite past time is to climb aboard her Ninja motorcycle and cruise the former Soviet Bloc. What makes her site unique is that she does most of her touring in and around Cherynobl, also known as Ghost Town. The photos she has posted are erie and really made me stop and ponder the consequences brought about by some of the choices humanity has made. Several images have haunted my subconscious sense my initial viewing of her site. I will leave my opinions for another time so that anyone who decides to visit her site can see her photos from fresh eyes. I will say that viewing her photos brought to mind the poetry of T.S. Elliot especially the poem:   urlLink The Waste Land  .

						   Every family has their would a, should a, could a been story. Ours is no different.  In the early thirties my maternal grandfathers family moved to Los Angeles from Milwaukee. My great grandfather Herman purchased a storefront on Wilshire Blvd. in a part of town that came to be known as the Miracle Mile.  Herman and his son's Stanley and Arthur (my grandfather) opened a radio sales and repair shop. They worked hard and their business prospered. One day Stanley went to his father and told him about the wondrous new product he had seen. The television. He was very enthusiastic in explaining to Herman and Arthur how the salesman had convinced him the television was the future and the glory days of radio would soon fade. His idea was for them to slowly move out of radio sales and into television. While Arthur agreed and understood that there might be a future in television sales Herman would have none of it. Like a lot of people he felt that television was a passing fad and he was not about to mortgage his families future on a whim. Being the patriarch and owner his vote was all that counted and the family remained in the radio business.  Of course history tells us that television went on to dominate American culture. As so many others had, Herman misread the signs and ended up going out of business.  On a side note, Wilshire Blvd. and the Miracle Mile went on to become some of the highest priced real estate in Southern California. With a little bit of for sight my great grandfather would have been a wealthy man.

						   I was looking through some of my maternal grandmother's papers today. When she passed away most everyone wanted the furniture, jewelry, etc. I on the other hand wanted everything that related to family history. Letters she exchanged with my grandfather, with her relatives, her nursing license. Basically anything that spoke to me from the past. In reading through the material today I was reminded how a family's destiny is never set in stone but flows through time.  My great-grandfather Quinto emigrated from Italy to South Africa in 1899. He was a miner by trade and went to work the diamond mines. He left his family behind with the intention of having them move to South Africa once he was settled. He was not there very long before the Boer War broke out. He wrote to my great grandmother and asked her to remain in Italy until the war had drawn to a close. Once the war continued into its second year he decided that South Africa was not the place he wanted to raise his family. He discussed this with some of his fellow emigrants and found that several Italian families he knew were leaving for Lexington, Missouri. So he abandoned the diamond mines and headed home. He talked it over with my great grandmother and they decided he would head for the America first and find a home and she would follow. So Quinto left Italy and arrived at Ellis Island in 1901. From there he went to Lexington and found work in the coalmines.  My great grandmother Maria followed in 1902. She sailed with two children from Port Le Havre, Seine-Inferior, France on the La Lorraine. Being a relatively poor family they did not have a private room. They traveled in what was basically steerage class with blankets hung from the ceiling to offer some degree of privacy. Her children were Eligio 2 and Adriana who was just 4 months old. Adriana was miserable for most of the trip being both seasick and teething. The little family arrived at Ellis Island on June 7, 1902 and took a train from New York to Missouri. Where Quinto met them and they began a new life. My great grandparents had five more children that were born in Lexington. Most importantly (to me at least) my grandmother Elda was born there in 1906.

						   The sound of yesterday's laughter still rings loudly within my ears. Unwelcome reminders of promises made, broken and left behind. Teen years spent in splendid adolescent isolation. Lost in world of literature oblivious to the surrounding sea of hormones. No time for extracurricular activities when books hid new and wondrous worlds to be explored. Worked for the Cask and Cleaver bussing tables and cleaning floors. Dropped in then dropped out of the local college found out law books did not hold the answers. Had a choice to make between school and a career when BofA came calling. Chose BofA and spent twelve years as a corporate serf earning an office without a door. Mergers dominated the early nineties and was merged right out of a job. Experienced the nirvana that is unemployment recording time with chalk marks on the wall. Then Magellan left for Venus so JPL was joined. Spent a year boxing photos from other worlds and playing softball with the techies. Met Sagan before he died and watched Galileo leave for Jupiter. More photos to be boxed until one faulty antenna send funding out the door. Temporarily rejoined the shuffling unemployed before cooking for the priests at Annunciation. Before the stars called again and Griffith Observatory was joined. Counting the cash and training the crew while watching the sun set in the Pacific. Took a test and joined the City of LA still counting cash but the benefits are better.

						   I have begun to develop an outright hatred for the phone.   Growing up the adults around me limited their use of the phone to actual communication. Phone calls would last less than five minutes and actual information would be exchanged.  "BBQ at our house Saturday night." "Bridge at your house Friday" "Meeting at the lodge Tuesday"  The only exception would be those bi-yearly phone calls from long distance relatives. A rare hour would be spent on the phone catching up on the family gossip.  Now the phone has become a security blanket. People call at all hours of day or night. The calls serve no purpose, no information is exchanged and no connection is made.  "Hello" "What are you doing?" "Nothing. What are you doing?" "Nothing." "blah blah blah blah" "blah blah blah blah" "blah blah blah blah" "blah blah blah blah" "Later" "Later"  The above sounds like a conversation between bored teens but I expect that behavior from teens. I am referring to other adults who call my house with no real purpose. I know its rude but I have begun to screen the calls with my answering machine. Unless it seems important most calls I just ignore. Maybe I am slowly evolving into an unsociable being, so be it. If being unsociable means I can avoid inane conversation with know no than that describes me.  I guess in the future I will resolve to be more selective in choosing who receives my phone number.

						   Nana Part 1 was posted February 24th of this year.  In December she lost her independence. The change was gradual but soon her world had been reduced to her yard and the six rooms of her house.  The first sign of the coming loss was difficulty in finding her way home. After her weekly doctors appointment she called Dial-A-Ride for a ride home. Except once they were underway she could no longer remember where she lived. To embarrassed to ask for help she panicked and had the driver leave her off at Fifth and Duarte, which was a good mile from her home. She attempted to walk but could not remember in which direction she lived. Fortunately for her a friend happened by and offered her a ride.   The second sign came when she found herself away from home with no recollection of having left. One Tuesday morning she walked to her church apparently intent on attending mass. When control was returned to her, she found herself sitting in her usual pew, in an empty church wearing only her nightgown and bedroom slippers. Her grandson was by her side asking her if everything was OK. He took her by the arm and gently led her to the car.  The final sign came when locked gates were installed on her property and a deadbolt, she was unable to reach, was installed on the front door. In her more coherent moments she acknowledged that for her safety it was necessary. In her less coherent moments she found herself screaming at her daughter and her grandchildren using words she had never spoken aloud in her long life.  Her fear at times became so dominant that she would scream anything that came into her mind. One evening when her grandson was preparing her dinner she forgot what he was doing. When he picked up a knife, she began screaming. He attempted to calm her but she screamed even louder accusing him of trying to kill her. Before she knew it the sheriff was at her front door inquiring about her safety. Having forgotten about her screaming she had no idea why they were there. It took an hour and a phone call to her daughter to convince them that everything was OK.  In December when she went to bed she rarely if ever said her prayers. For the most part she did not remember how to pray or even remember her who God was. When she did remember God she found herself blaming Him for condition. After a lifetime of childlike faith she concluded that God was cruel and unjust and unworthy of her devotion. She embraced her doubt and refused to acknowledge his existence.

						   Summer 1982, there were four of us (two couples), who planned what should have been an exciting weekend in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. Instead it became most probably one of the worst weekends that I have had the misfortune to endure.  We drove down on a Friday night. The first clue we had that luck was not looking over our shoulder came when we stopped for dinner. No water (not that we would have drank it), no ice (ditto) and only warm beer or soda available for consumption. Being too hungry to move on we grinned and bore it. Eating our fish tacos with warm Mexican beer.  The next warning shot across the bow came when we had settled in at our motel. The couple we were traveling with had brought along a bottle of champagne, which they had kept on ice. For whatever reason the darn cork would not come out of the bottle. We tried everything but to no avail. Finally I was sitting on the floor using a screwdriver to slowly loosen the cork when the bottle decided to explode in my lap. My hands went numb and I was sure that I had lost at least one major body part. When I finally developed the courage to look down I expected to find myself sitting in a pool of my own blood. Instead I found that my guardian angel was being rather efficient, my lap was covered in broken glass but I had not received a single scratch.  The next day my traveling companion who happened to be Mexican informed us that it was traditional for tourists in Ensenada to visit La Bufadora (the blowhole). So we set off in the car for the blowhole. It was located about thirty miles outside of the city. Most of the country we drove through was farmland. The road, so called, was a two-lane highway, which the farmers treated as their own. They were all over the road ignoring their assigned lane. Several times we were almost run off the road by old jalopies being driven on the wrong side of the road. Close to an hour later we finally reached the parking lot. We walked for another half mile to reach La Bufadora. We stopped behind the provided guardrail and waited for the excitement to begin. There was a low rumble similar to thunder and then much to our amazement water shot up in the air from a hole in the cliff. We almost died so we could thrill to site of water pressure throwing moisture into the air through a hole formed by erosion. Needless to say we were somewhat disappointed after the big buildup my significant other had given it. It would have been much safer to read the travel brochure in our room which explained: La Bufadora (The Blowhole): A natural cave formed by marine erosion, throws a gush of water that rises up to 24 feet when the waves come into it, producing the sound associated to its name; an amazing natural blowhole that spews seawater and foam high into the air. Several photographs accompanied the explanation.  On our final day in glorious Ensenada we were pulled over by the police for a supposed traffic violation. Apparently, the police there have developed the habit of supplementing their income by fleecing the tourists. We could either stay until Monday or Tuesday when the court opened and deal with the judge. Or we could pay the police officer to forget the whole thing. Needless to say we paid the officer and fled Ensenada as quickly as humanly possible.

						   I miss being up before my brother and sister on Saturday mornings, so I could pick which cartoons we would watch. We may have only had seven channels to choose from but they all seemed to have quality programming at least in my ten year old eyes. I miss watching those old shows while eating a big bowl or two of Count Chocula with lots of milk. I miss cartoons that were created for entertainment not half hour long infomercials.  I miss playing smear, pickle, freeze tag and all the other games we would make up. We would chase each other around the yard until our little legs could no longer move. Collapsing into panting heaps we would rest for a few minutes than get up and do it again. I miss spending hours setting up Lincoln Logs and toy soldiers only to destroy our handy work in five-minute battles. Or reenacting our own version of the Alamo (I was always Davy Crockett), using picnic tables for walls and broomsticks for rifles we would die spectacular, agonizing deaths as our position was overrun.  I miss sitting in my tree house on warm summer afternoons. Sipping an ice-cold coke (before they messed with the recipe) and reading the latest Hardy Boys adventure. I miss hiking in Monrovia Canyon still young enough to think that trails were for losers. We would go straight up hillsides and waterfalls and come home with the scratches, bruises and poison oak to prove it.  I miss going to the drive-in, all of us kids sporting pajamas. The smell of fresh popped homemade popcorn drenched in real butter can still bring a smile to my lips. I miss heading off to the playground between movies; swinging, sliding and chasing the merry-go-round, in our pajamas with a hundred other kids. None of our parents worried about us because no one believed anything bad would ever happen and it never did.  I miss sneaking out of bed after my parents were asleep and watching Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show. Back when he was on five days a week and the show ran one and a half hours. I miss all of the old stars that would drop in just to chat not because they had something to promote. Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jimmy Stewart, and Lucille Ball you never knew who might turn up or what they might say, but you were guaranteed to be entertained. I miss the networks signing off at one A.M. Fighter planes would scream across the screen, while someone sang God Bless America. Flags would flap in the wind and a voice would announce that we had reached the end of the broadcast day.  Most of all I miss my childhood friends. David, Mark, Carolyn, Patty, Joyce, Mike, Fred, Ricky, David and Diane. We had some great times and some not so great times but I miss them one and all.

						   In the corner of the room sat a hand made oaken bookshelf. The one his great-grandfather had built in his workshop more than fifty years ago. Pops, as he had called him, left the oak in its natural state with just a thin coat of varnish for preservation.   Two of the shelves held books, mostly science fiction and philosophy with a few classics thrown in for good measure. Cervantes, Hugo, Stevenson, Dumas and Stoker were well represented. A third shelf held a small collection of National Geographic's from the years 1959 through 1965. Most of the books and magazines were well preserved although they were covered with a light coating of dust.  The top shelf held his three most precious possessions.   There was an old fashioned lighter, that had been manufactured by Ronson at a plant located in Newark, New Jersey. The lighter fluid was refilled through a seal that could be found on the bottom of the lighter. It was set into a saucer shaped piece of crystal. The crystal was mounted into a sterling silver base and held in place by five sterling silver leafs. He was not a smoker; he kept it for the sentimental value for it had belonged to his grandfather, the same one who had built the bookcase.  Next to the lighter was a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the Baby Jesus. Mary had a pink dress with a blue cape and a white veil upon her head. Her gown, cape and veil are trimmed in gold. She has blue eyes and her feet are bare standing on a rounded white base. Jesus is wearing a simple white robe also with gold trim. In his hand he is holding a white flower trimmed in gold. While not an overtly religious person he kept the statue for its sentimental value. His great-grandmother had passed it on to his grandmother who had passed it on to him.  The final item was a simple leather box. The leather was old and cracked. It had once been a rich mahogany but the color had faded over the years. The hinges on the back of the box were simple leather straps. The box was rather dusty and was rarely removed from the top shelf. Inside was his most precious possession of all: his heart. It had been retired to the box years ago. Once a vibrant red his heart had faded until it resembled a red shirt after a month in the summer sun. Several cracks were visible; they appeared to have been repaired with masking tape. In the back of his mind he had always planned to place his heart back in his chest. He had planned to give love another chance but that time had never come. So in the box his heart remained waiting for princess charming to come along and heal his wounds.

						   A homemade frame protects the faded photograph; it resides on a bookshelf next to his computer. Weeks can go by without him giving it a second thought. Than out of the blue the image will catch his eye and he will find himself wandering down some long forgotten road.  He does not have any actual memories of the picture being taken. After all he was only three months old at the time. From what he has been told the image was captured on Christmas morning. He is wearing little blue pants and a white shirt. He has a blue knit cap covering the top of his head. Two things stand out when he observes his younger self, he had piercing blue eyes and quite a head of hair for a three month old.  On his lap he clutches his very first Christmas present. A sock monkey that he received from his mother, it is brown with a red and white striped vest and matching hat. He has clear memories of the monkey because it was his favorite toy well into his sixth year.  Holding him in the photograph is his father. Sadly this is the only holiday picture he owns of the two of them together. The image of his father always leaves him with a lump in his throat. His dad appears so young, vibrant and full of life. His hair is black and his eyes are clear. His entire face appears to have swallowed by his pride filled smile. It was Christmas morning and he was holding his first-born son. Life for the moment was perfect.  If only it could have remained so.

						   He met her in 1953. He was twenty-two and just beginning his military career, he had no desire to settle down. She was forty-two, cynical and expecting nothing more from life than a bushel of lemons. Their age difference was not common for their time and the odds were stacked against them. Sometimes however there is nothing on this earth that can stand between a couple and true love.  They were soon married and what a beautiful couple they made; him in his dress uniform and her in a beautiful bridal gown. They honeymooned on the Carolina coast not far from where they had met.  She was content being the wife of a military man. He was everything she had dreamed of and assumed that at her age had passed her by. He was strong but gentle. He was handsome but not conceited. He was smart but not overbearing. He climbed the ranks without leaving bodies on the ladder behind him.  For his part he had never expected to marry. He always believed he was one who was destined to bachelorhood. However when the time came he embraced marriage with more enthusiasm than he had thought possible. The love he held for her grew beyond the confines of his heart. His love for her grew beyond space and time. His love for her he soon realized was infinite.   Children were never part of the plan. He realized this when they married. The fifties were a time of great scientific breakthroughs but it was not a time where it was deemed safe for a woman in her forties to have a child for the first time. He accepted this without question and they built there life together just the two of them.  He retired from the military as a Lieutenant General with pride, honor and his sweetheart by his side. They retired to a small Southern California community where they lived in solitary tranquility. On weekends they would walk hand in hand to a nearby lake where they would picnic on the shore. Maybe they would read together, discuss the day, or maybe they would just lay in the sun two people finding comfort in their silent thoughts.  When she turned ninety she developed emphysema and began a long but steady decline. He was there by her side each and every step. He drove her to the doctors, picked up her medicines and took over all of the household chores. At first his cooking left a lot to be desired but soon he was able to whip up basic dishes with ease.  As her condition worsened she needed to take oxygen on a regular basis. She grew to weak to manage the stairs in their home so each morning he carried her down stairs and each evening he carried her back up. He fed her and he bathed her. He combed her hair and massaged her limbs. If the weather was nice he would carry out on to the patio. There he would sit on a big cushioned rocker with her on his lap. He would gently rock her back and forth while quietly singing old standards. His love and devotion never wavered.  No one was expecting him to leave the earth first, least of all his lovely bride. However one morning he carried her downstairs, sat her on the couch. Turned to go fix her breakfast and dropped then and there from a massive stroke. After fifty years of marriage she was alone once again.   At his memorial a lot of tears were shed for him. None of them were hers. When asked she simply said there was no need to mourn because she would be seeing him again before to long. Two months later she joined her beloved on the other side. Together again for all eternity.

						   Six P.M. he roamed the basement checking on the preparations for the big party. It was the first time his parents were allowing him to host a get together of his friends. He wanted everything to be perfect.  The sodas were on ice. Chips and various dips were strategically placed around the room. Stacks of albums were ready to go on the turntable. All that was missing were his guests. He checked his clock for what seemed like the hundredth time. He saw it was still early and he tried to relax.  Popularity was not his strong suit. Belonging to the chess club and the rocket club were not part of the proven path to popularity in any high school. He was not athletic so he did not belong with the jocks. He was not the best looking boy in school, which left him out of most social circles. Those few that drew closer to him found an agile mind and a great sense of humor. They also found that he was loyal to a fault. He forgave and forgot more than most people would or should.  Seven P.M. and his best friend arrived with the pizza. They spread the boxes of cheese heaven about the room and waited for the rest of the group to arrive. Conversation was easy between the two of them and they enjoyed a fierce debate concerning the merits of the Flyers and the Kings their two favorite teams.  Eight P.M. and his sister who was one year younger and much more popular came down to check out the "crowd". When she saw that no one had really arrived she rolled her eyes at her brother's rationalizations. She loved her brother but she never held back when she had something to say. She had attempted to explain to him that most of his "friends" were of the fair weather variety. She warned him that very few if any would show up. However, tonight upon seeing the shattered look in his eyes she wanted to find those "friends" and give them a piece of her mind.  Nine P.M. he sat on a bar stool wondering why no one had even called. Traveling the road of human nature without a map was proving to be difficult for him. He could rebuild his calculator. He could decipher trigonometry without breaking a sweat. The human mind though was an ocean of uncharted waters.  Ten P.M. the cheese and pepperoni had congealed into a greasy mass. The soda was flat and the sour cream dip was watery. No one had showed but his best friend. No calls, no apologies nothing. What hurt so much was not the no shows but the lack of explanations. It was as if to most of the world he was a non-entity unworthy of common courtesy.

						   Wonder filled the eyes of every girl and boy A cyclone came and destroyed all of the toys The tears they cried filled a reservoir  Though no one knew what the tears were for Someday the toys would all be found Scattered upon the barren ground But their search sealed their fate Taking them through the twisted gate Into Plato's retreatâ€¦  Fingers retreat down yellow walls Echo's screams in darkened halls A glimmer of light, a soul unbound What was lost can never be found A reflected image in broken glass Dorian Grey in a Halloween mask Lost hope ravaged their minds Shattered families they left behind Saved by Father Murphy and his bell Before their souls were lost in hell Beside the grave, beneath the tomb No returning to their mothers womb Life is now a hopeless cause Street rats believe in a Santa Claus Who drank all of the communion wine He left his dented sled behind They played their music good and loud Floating above the thunder clouds The rain fell for a day or two While children floated in the empty pool They saw the ship sink last night Avenging angels on endless flights Bowling balls broke thirty stairs No one had a dime to spare Beaten senseless by a winter storm Lost in a fire no longer warm Plato laughed as he locked the gate Checking the schedule for tomorrow's date Another patient will soon arrive Caught between dead or alive And Plato's retreat will ring once again With the shrieks of the howling wind  d.s. brueckner

						   He lived his life as an island.  Coral reefs. Blue lagoons. White sand. Coconuts. Date palms.  The days were all warm and breezy.  The night skies were filled with ancient stars, who whispered stories in his ear while he slept.   Life was good. But life was also lonely.  So he built bridges. From his island to one nearby that seemed similar to his own. He enjoyed the visit and he traded some date palms for some pineapples.  He enjoyed the experience so much that he built other bridges to other islands similar to his own. Trades were made and stories were exchanged.  Life was good. Life was no longer lonely. Until the discovery.  He began to notice little things. When one of the other islands suffered minor damage in a storm he set out for that island and offered assistance. Sometimes his aide was needed other times he was embraced and thanked for the offer.  However when his island suffered minor damage in a storm very few of the other islands offered assistance. It was than he noticed that most of the bridges he had built were one-way bridges. They connected him to the other islands but very few of the other islands were actually connected to his.  He was not sure what to do with this most recent revelation. He sat beneath the full moon and he pondered. The sun rose again and still he sat pondering. Finally he came to the conclusion that he was not offering enough aide, or assistance. He resolved to work harder and to help more. No matter the sacrifice.  So as storms came and seasons passed he offered his help to one and all. Palm fronds here. Fruit there. Repair work here. No matter the crisis he was there to help.  However nothing changed. His help was appreciated. He received handshakes, slaps on the back and heartfelt thank you's. That was all though. When his island was in need very few offered assistance. Despite the bridges he had built he was still alone.  To be continuedâ€¦

						   Summer of '69: I was playing little league for the Arcadia Raiders. I was not very good and I was small for my age. So of course I played right field. Fortunately this was the era before overly competitive parents took over children's sports and ruined the fun for generations to come.  I digress.  The point of the story really has no relation to little league whatsoever. I bring it up only because the events of this piece happened when I rode my bike home from practice.  My mother was divorced and we lived on Mountain Avenue, which was a relatively quiet street in Duarte, California. So imagine the surprise in my ten-year-old mind when I rounded the corner and found our house surrounded by Sheriff Cars. One of the neighbors was waiting for me and took me into their house all the while explaining that my family was okay and that my mother would explain later.  It took several hours but my mother finally came over to pick me up. She was visibly shaken but appeared to be just fine.  What had happened was not horrible in nature but bizarre. Apparently a woman had escaped from mental hospital located somewhere in Southern California. After several days or weeks wondering the streets she found her way to our little neighborhood.  For whatever reason upon seeing our little white house she decided to move in. And move in she did. She fixed herself a meal. She stripped down and took a long bubble bath in my mother's bathroom. Naked she climbed into bed and fell asleep which was where my mother found her.  A regular Goldilocks she was.  The responding deputy was unable to reason with her. She cussed him out and swore up and down that it was her house and that he was trespassing. Negotiations actually took several hours but they were finally able to convince her to leave peacefully and we were able to return to our home.  However the consequences of that day were far reaching. In a neighborhood where my mother always felt safe enough to leave our house unlocked she began locking the doors. Within a year of the incident she sold our house and we moved to a new neighborhood.

						   There was nothing left to say. No roads less traveled. He had left his ring in her favorite martini glass sitting on the bar. The one place they both knew she would find it.  She had always been a social drinker. Friday nights and sometimes Saturday brunch with the girls, a martini, a bloody mary, maybe a margarita or two. While he being the son of dysfunctional alcoholics rarely if ever found himself with a drink in his hand. He had done a spot of reading on the subject and found out that alcoholism was statistically higher in the second generation of an alcoholic family. While he accepted that not all statistics were factual he was not willing to risk his family or for that matter his liver and them being wrong.  In hindsight he found that there was not one particular event or moment that pushed her over the edge from social drinker to alcoholic. Loneliness, a miscarriage, her mothers' cancer fight any or all of the above could have been the straw that stirred the drink. In her eyes she was just fine. She could handle the booze and he was just jealous because she knew how to have a good time and he didn't.  They tried counseling but it was a spectacular failure. She was opened minded until her drinking became the topic on the table. When the subject was broached, the damn broke, and she ran out of the room with tears streaming down her face.  He did not hear from her until three that morning when she called from the local jail. Her car had wrapped itself around a telephone pole on the way home from the local pub. Fortunately no one was hurt. He bailed her out but she refused to discuss it with him. As far as she was concerned the one with the drinking problem was him, because he had a problem with her drinking.  The marriage disintegrated from there. He began sleeping on the couch, not so much to avoid her, but to avoid being woken up by her when she stumbled into bed. They rarely spoke. They were islands in the same current. Sharing sand but little else. He knew it was over. Nothing would change until she put down the bottle and he knew from experience that she was not ready for that.  He remembered the clear-eyed beauty he had married. How his love for her had seared his soul. Now his soul was filled with the damp embers of that forgotten feeling. He had no tears left to cry. No words left to say. So removed his ring and placed it in the glass. The symbolism of that action saying more than words ever could. He picked up his suitcase and walked out the door without looking back. Leaving her on the rocks.

						   He stood in the corner of the weight room. The class was for high school seniors and somehow he, a junior, finagled his way in. Therefore he was below contempt and ignored. Well almost ignored because for some reason he had chosen to wear a dark green sweat suit, which caused most of the student to refer to him as the pickle behind his back.  In his hands he grasped a large brown leather medicine ball. But being an island in a sea of seniors there was no one willing to share the medicine ball experience. As his gaze traveled around the room he noticed me, off in a corner, warming up by painfully stretching various underused muscles.  He approached me and quietly asked if I would throw the medicine ball with him. I am sure my peers expected me to ignore the intruder but frankly I did not care what my so-called peers thought. I was a rather solitary soul myself and was not worried about my popularity meter. So we began tossing the ball about.  Right out of the gate he began telling me how great the Philadelphia Flyers were. Being a dyed in the wool baseball fan I had no idea who the Flyers were. But being Los Angeles born and bred I was not about to surrender bragging rights. So I informed him that I am sure that our hockey team was much better than the Flyers. Much to my chagrin I later found out that the Flyers were the most recent winners of the Stanley Cup and that the Kings were one of the worst teams in hockey.  This spirited debate led to us working out together on a regular basis. As the semester progressed he became more accepted by the other seniors who on occasion actually lowered themselves to greeting. However, neither our developing friendship nor the reluctant acceptance of his presence by the other seniors precluded us from playing a small senior prank on him.  On the Friday before Memorial day weekend I convinced him to run laps around the football field. While we went out the west door the rest of the class went out the east door. As soon as he hit the track someone turned on the sprinklers and soaked him to the skin. We all had a good laugh and he was a surprisingly good sport about the whole affair.   Until the following Tuesday that is, you see my Junior friend was the only student with perfect attendance in the class. Perfect attendance was defined by not only being present but participating in the days activities.  With this in mind we returned to the locker room that morning to change for class and one particular locker had a rather foul odor emitting from it. It was his. He had left his pickle green sweat suit in his locker over the long holiday weekend and mildew had begun the reproductive process.  In order to preserve his perfect record my friend insisted he would dress for class. Which is about when our teacher came into the room, searching for the source of the odor. He informed our stubborn Junior that his record would remain perfect and he did not have to dress for class. But no, that was not good enough for my new friend. He insisted that the record would only count if he dressed and participated in that day's class. Which he did, much to the dismay of the seniors who had to complete their fitness exam with him in the weight room.  Some say revenge is a dish best serve cold, in this case it was a dish served damp and mildewy.

						   Family lore says that my parents expected my birth to occur on or about September 11, 1959. Most parents of that era would have been at home waiting for those all important labor pains to begin. Signifying that their first-born son was on the way.  Not my parents. September 11th found them at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum taking in a double header. The were rooting for the Dodger's, Los Angeles's newest team, as they took on the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Dodger's won both games and if my sense of timing had been better I would have a great story to share concerning my birth at a Dodger game.   As it turns out my mother did not go into labor until October 1st, which coincided with the first game of the world series. Through out the afternoon my mothers room resembled Grand Central Station as nurses, doctors and nuns (it was a Catholic Hospital) visited with surprising regularity, not necessarily to check on my mom's progress but the progress of the Dodger's. The Boys in Blue lost that game to the White Sox 11-0.  Between games one and two of the series I finally decided it was time to make my grand entrance into the world. It was a very difficult delivery for my mother, at one point the doctor even came to the conclusion that he may have to chose between her or her unborn child (me). Obviously, making that choice never came to pass, as both my mother and I are still alive and well.  My mom was returned to her room with me in tow in plenty of time to catch game two of the series which the Dodger's won 4-3. Her room was once again filled with visitors, who could blame them with such a beautiful baby just waiting to be spoiled, but no they were just there to find out the latest score.  This pattern continued through out the series. My mother and I were kept in the hospital for several days to ensure that there were no complications. Coincidently, the world series lasted until we were released.   Every game day found various people from around the hospital visiting our room to share in the experience of Los Angeles's first world series. Which of course the Dodger's won four games to two. And thus began my love of baseball and the Dodger's.

						   About five years ago, I found myself driving home from work on a beautiful summer day. Nothing extraordinary had happened; it was just a typical day at Griffith Observatory. Before long I reached Los Feliz and found myself in traffic jam of epic proportions. Cars were backed up to the horizon.   If by chance you live in or have visited Los Angeles you know this is a common experience. Traffic jams are a fact of life.   As I sat in my car pondering how much of my life I had wasted inhaling car exhaust I began to feel rather sick. My head was hurting, I was having trouble breathing, and my chest began to feel tight. I thought for sure this was the big one and that I was about to give up the ghost in the middle of traffic.  At the time I did not own a cell phone so my first thought was to get out of traffic. I managed to make an illegal turn on to a side street. Part of me figured I should stop someone and have him or her call for help. The other part of me began a steady course of rationalization, its probably nothing, don't bother anyone you just have a bad case of heartburn.  Heartburn won so I tracked down the nearest grocery store to purchase some antacids.  As I looked for the medicine aisle I began to feel worse. I was on the verge of asking someone to call the paramedics for me when I noticed a shopper in a nurses uniform.  Putting vanity and pride aside I approached her with the intention of asking for her assistance. I apologized for my intrusion and explained to her my symptoms and my fear that I was in the middle of a heart attack.  Rather than be put off her eyes filled with concern and she proceeded to lead me to the pharmacy area where they had one of those blood pressure machines. She checked my blood pressure and found it to be 210/145, which is very high for me. That really put the fear of God into me and I was all for heading straight for the nearest hospital. My nurse however suggested that I sit down and take some deep breaths and see if that would calm me and lower my blood pressure. I followed her instructions and slowly I began to feel better. After about ten minutes by blood pressure was almost normal.  I was perplexed as to what could have caused this but she explained that it was quite possible that being stuck in traffic had triggered some type of panic attack. I had never experienced a panic attack before but who was I to argue I was feeling better. I thanked her for her assistance and told her that I felt like I would be okay.  However as soon as she went back to her shopping all of my symptoms returned. I tracked her down and told her I did not want to be alone so she let me tag along while she finished her shopping. As long as she was within my sight I felt almost normal, if I lost sight of her up went the blood pressure.  Upon completing her shopping I went with her out into the parking lot. We sat and chatted awhile but I could not get over the fear that if she left all of my symptoms would return. My nurse did not feel comfortable leaving me but we could not stay in the parking lot all night. While discussing what I could do, I found out that she lived just down the freeway from me. Upon realizing this she offered to follow me home and to ensure that I arrived safely.  Before I returned to my car she reached into her trunk and handed my a teddy bear. She said that she kept extras there for patients who did not receive many visitors. Handing it to me she advised me to squeeze it if I felt panicky and it would help me get home okay.   With her following me I finally made it home safely. As for my nurse or as I call her my guardian angel that was the one and only time I saw her.  Postscript: as it turns out my nurse was correct I was having a panic attack. I have sense been diagnosed with panic disorder and am taking medication to control the attacks.

						   Mr. B was my English teacher during my senior year in high school. To be honest though he really did not have to do much teaching. His class was basically a throw away class for those students who had completed their English requirements and were looking to kill 45 minutes.  The class was simply called "Book Reading". The requirements for the class were simple. Read at least one book a week and turn in a book report. Class time consisted of quiet reading and/or the writing of the reports.  Being an avid reader and somewhat competitive I asked Mr. B what the record was book reports in a school year. He informed me that the most reports he had ever received were thirty-one. No problem I told him, the record will soon belong to me. He wished me luck and I began hitting the books.  The previous record of thirty-one books fell before Christmas break. However I wanted to ensure that record was unattainable by future generations. So I kept reading and completing book reports and by the time May rolled around I had read over seventy-five books.  My biggest problem was scrounging new material to read. I had read most of the books in the school library and I was working so my visits to the public library were few and far between. Desperate times call for desperate measures so I began to delve into my mother's book collection. No big deal really, except for my mother's taste running towards Jacqueline Susann, Harold Robbins and Danielle Steele. Not the best writers in the world but they were essential contributors to my setting a record that as far as I know remains unbroken.  Whenever I approached his desk Mr. B would glance at the paper in my hand and roll his eyes when he saw the title of my latest book report. Every now and then I would mix in some classics so he would not think my mind was perpetually in the gutter. However, no matter what I read he did not comment nor make any mention of my choices. He would just smile and enter another mark in his ledger.  In fact the only mention he ever made was when he signed my senior annual. He wrote:  Darrell,  In spite of the fact that you've reported on more pornographic books than any other kid, I've enjoyed having you in my class.  Best Regards,  Mr. B

						   Midnight. Somewhere out west where a small house clings to cliff face jutting out over the pacific ocean. All is quiet as he roams the hallways. He checks on the children. Sleeping in their cocoons, protected from the outside world by their parents love. A cover tucked in here; a brow brushed there, and then he leaves them to dream in peace.  He crosses to the master bedroom where she sleeps. Her face softened by the moonlight hardly resembles the mask she has come to wear. When did she become so bitter, he wonders. What chains were holding her heart in place preventing her from soaring amongst the clouds like she once did?  Once upon a time, or so the story goes, he possessed the key to the chest that shielded all of her thoughts. Now that chest was protected by a fire breathing dragon, whose fire scalded him whenever he drew to close.  Leaving the house he sat in his favorite chair letting the cool sea breeze calm the storm in his soul.  He searched his memory for a remnant of the love he felt for her. But it was lost like a raindrop in a hurricane.   In the darkness he could hear the crashing surf erasing the debris left behind by today's swarm of tourists. He longed for the simplicity of sitting in the sand, salt water tickling his toes while he sipped an ice-cold beer.   Those days were gone though. The weight of his broken marriage was drowning his soul in self-pity. He had a choice. He could leave a note climb in his car and disappear into the northwest. No one would be the wiser.   However, he was anchored here by three very important reasons. His three children. They were the light of his life, his reason for living. The flame of love for his wife may have been reduced to embers but he would keep those embers alive for them and for yesterdays memories.

						   My first serious job was working for the real estate loan center of a major bank. I worked in the records department, which housed the real estate loans for the entire state. Basically it was a small library and our customers were other bank employees who only stopped by our little whole in the wall when they needed to borrow a loan file.   We were the stepchildren no one wanted. No budget. Few supplies. My boss did not even qualify for a secretary so I had to teach myself how to type so we could produce timesheets and memos in a somewhat professional manner. In order to make our working conditions bearable we used to make after hour raids to other departments to "borrow" equipment. Unused office chairs, a typewriter, filing cabinets and our biggest "find" a section of new carpet.  However, no matter how much we improved our work area the other units still looked down their collective noses at us. So being nineteen years old and not knowing any better I made it my life's mission to crack the faÃ§ade our customers insisted on maintaining when they visited our little corner of paradise.  I was always somewhat of a smart ass in those days, for that matter I probably still am. So slowly but surely I began to tweak the nose of the establishment.  I began by posting simple comic strips or jokes on the "For Business Uses Only" bulletin board just inside our office door. Just as soon as some bigwig would remove them I would repost the same ones. This went on for a quite a bit until I wore the person down and they gave up. At that point others began posting items and pretty soon no business could be found on the business only bulletin board.  Next step was introducing Hawaiian shirts to the white shirt black pant aliens who at some point in the past must have taken over the banking world. Normal people do not dress like bankers did at that time.  Technically our department had to do a lot of lifting and boxing so we could get away with dressing down. Therefore I began wearing Hawaiian shirts, first at random intervals during the summer. Then as it became more accepted the shirts became my badge of honor and I was rarely seen without one. Now I am not claiming that everyone began dressing down but it became more commonplace to see shirts that were not plain, ordinary, garden-variety white.  The final step in well thought out plan of confusion was to mess with their heads. I began leaving one corner of our counter clear of clutter at all times. If someone began to set something down in that spot I would ask to move his or her files to another location. It took longer than I expected but someone finally asked me why?  I looked at them for a moment like they were nuts and than explained it would not do for their files to knock over my goldfish bowl. The questioner shook their head and walked away. More people began asking and I explained about my two goldfish that I kept on the counter for beautification purposes.   Surprisingly before long people began leaving that space clear of clutter without prompting. Some would even ask me how the goldfish were doing. They were taking baby steps but our customers were beginning to lighten up and realize that banking did not mean you had to leave your sense of humor at home.  Before long I grew bored of the goldfish so I had to change the rules again. One morning I placed a pile of files where the "fish bowl" had been located. Again it took awhile but one of my regulars asked me where I had moved the fish? Doing my best to remain somber I informed them that the janitorial crew, in a horrible accident, had knocked over the goldfish bowl and they had flopped their last before I had come in that morning. All day our customers were asking about the accident and when I would replace the fish. No more fish I would say, they are too hard to protect from random accidents.  About a month later we received some new equipment and a large shipment of loans from another bank. So I reached into my bag of tricks and messed with the masses one more time.  One morning I inquired of one my regulars if they had met Jasper. They told me they had not had the pleasure and asked if he was a new employee. In a sense, he was new, but not an employee. I told them that Jasper was my invisible monkey and I left him in the office after hours so no one would walk off with our new equipment. Again it took a while but pretty soon most everyone was talking about Jasper. If something was moved from its normal location, Jasper did it. If a file was missing he misfiled it. Just to keep the stuffed shirts guessing every once in awhile I would send Jasper on a trip to Africa to visit his relatives.  But alas all good things must come to an end. My immediate supervisor received a promotion and I was moved up into his position. I sent Jasper home to find himself a bride and I had to become a bit more of a conformist than I would have liked. Though I did manage to keep the masses on their toes and my Hawaiian shirts on my back.

						   he roamed the outer fringes of sanity. preparing to protect his soul from the coming darkness. his weapons were few. aluminum foil, duct tape and a collection of barry manilow cd's.   he remembered nights spent at the copacabana with a blue-eyed beauty who had once shared a dance with him.   or had they shared matching straight jackets in the waiting room at Las Encinas. he did not know for his memory had been scrubbed clean with electric sandpaper in a room benignly labeled "utility closet" by a suit with a misguided sense of irony.  despite the wattage voices continued to call out "marco polo" as he blindly searched the emptiness for a moment's peace. beyond the horizon of what he once called reality little green gremlins chased away the sandman. leaving him to contemplate four white walls and a door less closet. where his sanity had been pressed and hung. useless armor against the sharpened needles; which promised a new tomorrow grasped in the gloved hands of doctors who promised sustenance. but he knew better. bitter experience had prepared him for the truth. behind the surgical masks were renaissance clowns laughing manically.  and he screamed

						   When I was three months old I received a Sock Monkey as a gift. Most likely it was my very first Christmas present. Some children have pacifiers. Some have security blankets. I had monkey. He went everywhere I went and he did everything I did. If I had to visit the doctor for a check up or vaccination monkey had to come along. When the doctor examined me I would insist that he examine monkey to. If I received a shot so did he.  As two turned into three and three into four my mother was sure some new toy would replace that monkey. She grew tired of washing him after a day or two of being drug threw the dirt by me. However, no matter what new gift I received monkey remained my one true love.  Then it happened, Christmas 1965, I stumbled sleepily into the living room wondering what magic Santa had performed the night before. The stockings were overflowing with knick-knacks but my young eyes had already zeroed in on the gift of all gifts.  Between the fireplace and the Christmas tree stood a three-foot tall robot. It was love at first sight. I was struck dumb. I slowly approached the robot with a mixture of awe and trepidation.  I reached out a trembling hand and touched its arm. My mother reached behind the robots head and flipped a switch and it slowly began to roll forward. Its eyes flashed red and a rumble came from deep within its chest. At the push of another button its right arm raised and fired plastic missiles. Another button and the left arm raised and fired ping-pong balls.   I was so lost in playing with my robot that I do not to this day remember opening any other presents. I am sure I did but I have no idea what they were or what I did with them. That afternoon my best friend M. came over to compare gifts like kids are prone to do. When I saw him approaching, I took robot to greet him. The first thing M. saw when I opened the door was robots red flashing eyes as it rolled toward the door. He took one look at robot and ran screaming for his mother. From that day forward M. would not enter the house unless I assured him that robot was locked in the closet.  So my mother aided by Santa finally found a gift that came to mean as much to me as monkey. The battle wasn't over though. She kept insisting that now that my brother was two years old I should pass monkey on to him. Was she kidding if I gave monkey to my brother he would not last a month. I pleaded and I begged but my mother finally insisted and took monkey from me and gave him to my brother.  I was wrong about how long monkey would last in his hands, I predicted one month but monkey lasted three. One winter's day he left him outside and that night it rained cats and dogs. By morning monkey was no more.  For close to forty years I refused to let my mother forget her role in the destruction of sock monkey. Finally, she grew so sick of hearing me moan, groan and complain that she presented me with a new monkey for my fortieth birthday. One she made with her own two hands. Don't tell old monkey but I think like new monkey best.   As for robot his fate is unknown. I played with him for several years before he was relegated to the back of the closet with the other forgotten toys. For some reason to this day when I think of him I see cracked and tattered robot on top of a rubbish heap with single red tear glistening on a plastic cheek.

						    Final paragraph of "The Gift" posted on April 22, 2004  In the fourteen years since I have only removed it for x-rays and surgeries. Also I can honestly say that this gold chain once saved my life but that is a tale for another day.   It was Thanksgiving Eve and I was on disability from my then employer due to recent knee surgery. Nothing major, just a scope to clean out some old debris. However, it was my third surgery on the same knee and my rehab was taking longer than planned. My range of movement and flexibility resembled the movements of a mime doing the old trapped in the box routine. My doctor had me in physical therapy four days a week and he also recommended a daily bike ride.  At the time I was living in North Hollywood so there were plenty of place to explore on my rehab rides. I spent most of my time riding in and around Griffith Park. For those of you who are not familiar with the Los Angeles area, Griffith Park is a huge tract of land left to the city on the condition that the land be preserved as is for future generations. Which for the most part it has.   On this particular ride I changed my normal routine and rode to my favorite use bookstore: The Iliad. A great place to browse with several overstuffed couches and books to suit every readers taste. A quick aside The Iliad just happens to be located adjacent to The Odyssey Video Store.  Upon finishing my browsing I hobbled out to my bike and began the ride home. Now in hindsight the following incident would most probably have been avoided if it wasn't rush hour and if I had chosen to ride with the traffic instead of against it.  I had ridden maybe two blocks stopping at each side street before crossing without problem. I came to the third block stopped and saw a car waiting to turn into traffic. Since traffic was heavy I assumed she would be awhile and left the curb. Unfortunately the driver of the car decided that the very small gap she saw was large enough for her to force her way into traffic. She accelerated and never even saw me.  Her car hit me broad side. My bike and I slid under the car and my tender skull seemed to be destined for a rather painful introduction to her right front tire. I closed my eyes and did my best to prepare for what I assumed to be imminent impact. Suddenly instead of sliding my entire body was jerked to a stop. I opened my eyes and her tire was coming to a stop well short of my skull. For a moment or two I just kind of laid there in a daze. As I began to pull myself together I realized that I had never hit the ground. It seems that my gold chain and crucifix had caught on the bumper and prevented my head from becoming a pancake.  When it was all said and done I walked away without any major injuries, just a sprained shoulder, a burn on my neck from the chain and various bumps and bruises.   The next day when I arrived at my mom's for Thanksgiving dinner I gave her a big hug and a kiss and thanked her for helping to save my life.

						   In 1969 my family moved away from the neighborhood in which I had spent most of my young life. The move was accomplished rather quickly leaving us less than a day to say good-by to all of our friends.   My best friend was a few years older than me. Our age differences really did not matter because we had so much in common. Especially our undying devotion to baseball and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Not a day went by that didn't include baseball somewhere on our agenda.  When I visited his house for the last time he presented me with a cardboard box full of baseball cards. We both had been collecting baseball cards for several years but my collection was a mere shadow of his. At first I refused to believe him but soon enough he had me convinced that he sincerely wanted me to have them.  In today's market the cards he had given me were worth several thousand dollars. We had no idea that these pieces of cardboard, smelling like bubble gum would someday be valuable. In 1969 a baseball card was something you either swapped with your friends or stuck between the spokes on your bicycle.   The collection I inherited from him represented some of the best to play the game in the 50's and the 60's. Over the next few years I continued to add to the collection. As each new baseball season began I would take my allowance money and buy as many packages of cards as I could afford.   By 1974 my collection contained well over three thousand cards but my enthusiasm for my chosen hobby had begun to wane. I still followed the Dodger's but the cards were boxed up and put away in the garage.  Several months passed without me giving my collection a second thought. One afternoon my brother and I had an argument, just a sibling shouting match nothing more. To this day I do not remember what we were arguing about. Whatever it was really ticked him off and he promised that he would pay me back. I never gave it a second thought but he must have given it a third and fourth thought because he did get his revenge.  We had a small hill in our back yard covered in shrubs and trees. A few weeks after our argument I was hiking about the hill when I stumbled upon a familiar looking box, soaking wet and covered in mildew. I removed the lid and there was my baseball card collection. The cards were damaged beyond repair.   When confronted my brother had completely forgotten that he had hidden the cards. He had assumed that I would notice the next day that they were missing. He had no idea that they had become part of my past.

						   My mother has gift buying down to a science. She asks me what I want for my birthday or Christmas and than she buys it. Even though I know what the gift is she insists on wrapping it and presenting it to me on the special day.   Only once in the past twenty-five years has she broken with tradition and the gift I received means more to me than all of the others combined.  To understand its value a little background is necessary. My mother is not a religious woman. She was baptized and raised a Catholic. She took her first communion and was confirmed when she was in eighth grade. My father and her were married in the church and she continued to attend mass on a regular basis. That is until she divorced my father and was told she was no longer allowed to take communion. She attempted to explain that my father was an alcoholic and an unfit parent. Her arguments fell on deaf ears. The church "graciously" allowed her to attend mass but she was banned from participation. My mother chose to no longer attend mass.  On the other hand she baptized the three of us and sent us to Catholic school. She would drop us off at mass each Sunday and pick us up when the service was over. However the only time she would enter a church was on special occasions: baptisms, first communions, confirmations, weddings and funerals. Like I said by no means could you describe her as being religious.  As I grew older I began to question my beliefs and my spiritual journey has taken me down many different paths. I continued to attend mass with my grandmother more out of tradition than faith. I never disowned the church like my mother but I never developed the blind faith of my grandmother. For me religion was something to be explored not accepted at face value.  That being said, about fourteen years ago I began wearing a silver chain with an old crucifix on it. I no longer remember the reason. It may have been a gift from a girlfriend or just something I picked up. Over time the chain became tarnished and the crucifix began to look that it had survived the two millennia since Christ's birth.  The Christmas season arrived and I had presented my mother with my usual list.    Christmas day arrived and with it the usual family festivities. I gave my mom and stepfather their gifts and my mom presented me with a very small box. I was stumped, confused, bamboozled and speechless. My mother had broken with tradition. I knew that none of the gifts on my list would fit in such a small box consequently I had no idea what was in the box I was holding. I must have sat there for five minutes trying to unravel the mystery of what could be in the package.   My wits finally returned and I opened the present. The wrapping paper had been covering a box that resembled the type that rings come in. I knew it wasn't a ring so I was still confused. When I finally managed to get my fingers working again and opened the box I was stunned.  Inside was a fourteen caret gold crucifix and chain. My mother the affirmed agnostic had purchased a crucifix for me. My mother is not one to show emotions but when she saw the joy on my face I could swear I saw a tear or two in her eye. As I thanked her she tried to hide her feelings by explaining that she only bought it because she was tired of seeing the old one around my neck. I removed my old crucifix and chain and replaced it with the new one.   In the fourteen years since I have only removed it for x-rays and surgeries. Also, I can honestly say that this gold chain once saved my life but that is a tale for another day.

						   Summer 1978: My mom was asleep on the couch she always fell asleep on the couch especially on Saturday nights when my stepfather was tending bar. I was watching the late movie. Knowing my taste it was probably a campy horror movie from the fifties.   I was lost in the movie when my stepfather walked into the room. It was all I could do to keep from screaming the whole front of his shirt and face were covered in blood. My first thought was that their had been trouble at the wedding he was working. Every once in awhile a fight would break out or someone would get stabbed. My mother always worried that something would happen to him while working a wedding. As I stared in shock at his appearance I thought to myself my mom was right to worry.  I scrambled to wake up my mother. She was always a heavy sleeper but when I explained that something had happened to Jay (my step dad) she snapped out of her dream world in a flash.  She jumped from the couch and ran to him, she grabbed him by the arms and searched his torso for some type of wound. It was than he explained to us that nothing had happened at the wedding. He had fallen asleep at the wheel driving home and missed the last turn before our street running into a tree. My mother than noticed the hole in his lip he had bit it right through. The amount of blood was due to the blood thinners he took for his bad heart.  The first order of business was to take him to the hospital but someone needed to stay with the car and talk to the police. That of course became my job. Just as we left our house we saw a patrol car slowly making its way up our street with a searchlight. It was fairly obvious that they were looking for the person or persons involved in the accident. My mom explained to them that she was taking Jay to the hospital and that he would answer all their questions there. She dropped me off at the accident scene and went on her way.  My step dad's car was a brand new white Cadillac with red leather upholstery. Not any more. The car had run head on into an old oak tree. It was totaled. The oak tree was barely damaged. From the cars appearance my stepfather was lucky to walk away with as few injuries as he did. The police officers remained at the scene with me for a few moments and asked my for Jay's basic info. They called a tow truck and informed me that it would probably be a half hour before one made it to my location. I thanked them and they headed to the hospital to complete their report.  As for me, I sat on the hood of the car and waited for the tow truck to arrive. It was chilly and I was only wearing a t-shirt. I began walking around the car to stay warm. Of course I would jump at every branch creak or owl hoot. Wondering what danger might be lurking around the corner. As it turned out I did not have long to wait.  After about ten minutes a car pulled up and a man got out. I had never believed in a sixth sense before but my senses began buzzing the moment I laid eyes on him. The weird part was that he did not look like trouble. He was dressed in jeans and a long sleeve shirt, tennis shoes and he was clean-shaven. His eyes though were like looking into an abyss. Before he spoke a word I knew that if I were to go off with him someplace I would never return. As he approached the car I kept moving keeping my distance from him. He asked me if I was OK and I explained that my stepfather had been the driver and that he was at the hospital. I told the police and the tow truck driver would be here any minute to make their report and to tow the car.  He told me that I looked awfully cold and asked if I wanted to wait in his car. I explained that I wasn't cold just nervous and worried about my step dad. Yet again he offered me a seat in his car and again I turned him down. By now I was thinking to myself where in the hell is the tow truck, he better not be on a coffee break or something.  As much as I tried to keep a distance between us he kept slowly closing it without being obvious. He began talking about how hungry he was and asked me if I wanted to go with him to breakfast after the tow truck came. No, I don't think so I'm not hungry and I am to worried about my step dad. He would not take no for an answer. He kept on trying to convince me to go with him and I kept walking away and praying for someone, anyone to drive by.   The more he hung around the more my senses told me that my very existence was in danger. I knew I did not have much longer before he made a move and I began planning my response. Just than and not a moment to soon the tow truck driver arrived. Not just any driver but someone who was probably 220 pounds all muscle. My lurker took one look at him and knew that he had no chance. He made one last halfhearted effort to convince me to leave with him and when I turned him down he left.  Not knowing if he was really gone or lurking around the corner I chatted up the driver and asked him if he could give me a ride home. It was not far but I was not about to walk it alone. However, my request proved unnecessary just as he finished hooking up the car my parents returned from the ER. I was never more thankful to see them in my life.  To this day I have wondered about that guy. In the 70's no one really talked about serial killers and other horrors. Knowing what I know now I am convinced that he was one and that I was very lucky to get away with my life.

						   My body was found today Pulled from beneath the Golden Gate By the coroner and a cop or two They laid me out on a plastic sheet Searched my body for some ID Came across my old leather wallet Empty, but for two pictures Of people I never forgot One was of my old platoon Men who died in Vietnam The other was of my girl Who left before I came home In another pocket, they found a rusty medal Someone cried "My God, he was a hero" I had won the medal of honor But still I died alone  People gathered to watch the scene Talking amongst themselves Speculating on what might have been What had brought me to this place In Vietnam I was a man in charge Of men and million dollar machines Living through days of horror Doing things I still can't believe I did it all for my country I did it all for God When I came home there was no parade I could not find a job And no matter how I searched Happiness could not be found Even when I was stoned No peace of mind could be found Tormented my so many memories Of children screaming in the dark I keep seeing old men Hanging in the park I still remember the dying screams Of both Americans and the Viet Cong Somehow I knew even then This war just had to be wrong  Stateside doctors tried to help me Diagnosing me with post traumatic stress They gave me lots of little colored pills But nothing seemed to work Finally the voices have grown to loud My mind has found no peace So many lives I have ended Will this nightmare never cease I know the Japanese understood Their warriors died with honor  So the Golden Gate was my sword And I died the death of a samurai

						   Three kids in feet pajamas. Bouncing with excitement in the back seat of the Rambler station wagon. The youngest has blue pajamas with yellow duckies. The middle child is wearing pink pajamas covered in Barbie dolls. The oldest, his nose buried in book about the Alamo, has pajamas with Cowboys and Indians chasing each other across the material.   A brown grocery store bag fails to contain the aroma of freshly popped popcorn, covered in real butter. The scent of the popcorn dances with the smell of freshly grilled burgers from the local mom and pop. Four wax cups, covered in moisture, hold the sweet taste of coke and a promise to wash down all of the good eats.  The car pulls up beneath the marquee. A large neon sign lights up the evening sky announcing to the local population that this is the Big Sky Drive-In. Four tickets are purchased. What movies are playing? It doesn't really matter it is Saturday and it is family night out.  A speaker is hung from the window of the families Rambler. An argument develops over which of the children gets to share the front seat with the mother. The oldest wins out and clambers over the seat. Elbows and chin on the dashboard he leans forward in anticipation waiting for the entertainment to begin. Before long the sound of previews and cartoon shorts can be heard through out the car. The movie begins and like magic the children fall into awed silence as they lose themselves in the action on the screen.   When the movie is over intermission begins which is every kid's favorite part of the evening. Car doors can be heard opening and slamming shut through out the drive in as kids of all age's race for the playground which stands beneath the big screen. Like the children in the Rambler most of the kids are in their pajamas. Soon the swings are full and a rowdy line has formed behind the slide. Not a parent can be found as the children enjoy a few moments of magic beneath the stars.  It seems that just a soon as the intermission began its over. The lights in the drive in blink off and on a few times and the kids abandon the playground in search of their family's car. Doors open and slam shut again and the sounds of the second feature begin.  In the Rambler everyone but the oldest boy falls asleep before the movie is half over. It happens every time the visit the drive in. He doesn't mind he is lost in the adventure on the screen. If the first movie was good enough he will sit through it again before he wakes up his mother to drive them home.

						   Fall 1974: I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am I now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as I struggled to make sense out of algebra the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there.  Great.  I returned to my studies and just as I was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my sub conscious the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there.  Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker. I thought about surprising my prankster but my math book was calling out to me and I really needed to get a handle on today's assignment.   My butt had barely touched the chair when the bell rang for a third time. I flew to the window and barely caught a glimpse of my neighbor SD running around the corner of the house. Mystery solved, I now knew who my joker was. SD was on of the more annoying kids on the block. Once he began a round of ding-dong ditch he rarely stopped until he had ramped the annoyance level to new highs.  Knowing his habits I decided that math could wait and that it was time to teach him a lesson. So I stood by the front door waiting for the next ring of the bell. I did not have to wait long. Not more than a minute had passed before the bell rang again. SD was so predictable. I flung open the door, SD through me a surprised glance and sprinted up the street toward his house. I flew out the door knowing I would have no problems catching him.  Big mistake.  Unbeknownst to me my little brother had left his skateboard on the front porch. I took one step out the door and my foot hit the skateboard and I flew up into the air like an extra from an old keystone kops movie. The flying was great it was my landing that was the problem.  There was a shrub next to our porch that had been planted by the previous owners. For support he had wire an iron bar to the plant. I fell into the plant and the bar went through my left armpit. I lay there in shock for a short moment then gently raised myself off of the bar. At this point my anger at SD dissipated and my concern turned towards my own well being. I was not bleeding to badly but it hurt like hell.  I called my mother at work and she came home to take me to the ER. After a tetanus shot and a few stitches I was as good as new. However the doctor did mention in passing that I was a very lucky young man. It seems that the bar basically scraped without damaging a main artery. If the artery had torn I would have bled out before the ambulance or my mother could have made it to the house.  So beware even a seemingly innocent game like ding-dong ditch can have insidious consequences.

						   As I sit here keyboard in hand, I am having difficulty keeping my imagination on its leash. For some reason every nook and cranny of the brain has become open game for exploration. While I am attempting to focus on one topic my mind is playing keep away with my creativity preventing me from putting together a coherent and readable piece.  It all began yesterday. I was anticipating spending all or at least part of the afternoon writing. As usual when it comes to the best-laid plans every time I attempted to sit and create the phone would ring or someone would come to the door. I found it impossible to keep my butt planted in the chair long enough to link two sentences together.  Finally around eleven PM I found myself free from obligations and distraction but to no avail. The muse had put on her best party dress and blew this dive for a night on the town with a few nouns and verbs. My reaction good for her and I spent an hour stubbornly planted in front of my keyboard pounding out one bland sentence after another. Realizing that I was only creating more stomach acid than witty prose I went to bed a somewhat frustrated artist. I figured tomorrow would be better.  Wrong. Here I sit in front of the same computer with no creative energy to be found. My muse is still hung over and the nouns and verbs found themselves in a fistfight over whom she liked better.  My only choice at this point is to refrain from pounding my head on my desk in frustration and hope tomorrow brings my writing world into crisper focus.

						   My maternal grandfather contracted emphysema after a lifetime of smoking. He was in his mid sixties and the doctors told him that while there was no cure, quitting smoking would without a doubt increase the length and quality of the time he had remaining.  Upon his return from the doctor he vowed to follow the doctors suggestion and attempt to eliminate smoking from his life. He boxed up his ashtrays and his lighter placing them in a far corner of the garage. Not knowing if he could resist temptation he asked my grandmother to go through the house and throw away any cigarettes she found. She had no problem with that as she had been after him to quit for years. Nana was nurse at the City of Hope and dealt with cigarette-damaged lungs on a daily basis.  Grandpa made good on his promise for almost a year. His lungs while still damaged began to function more efficiently. For him the biggest surprise was the return of his taste buds. For years he had been over seasoning his food because he could not longer taste it. After a few months away from tobacco he was able to once again distinguish flavors. His appetite improved and he actually put on a few pounds.  Than one evening disaster struck. While watching television some type of short circuit occurred and set caught fire. My grandfather's strength had yet to completely return and he could only manage one small pan filled with water at a time. While he was able to douse the flames before the fire departments arrival, he was not able to accept how weak he had become. His pride was shattered and that was the beginning of the end.  The next morning he went to the corner market and purchased a carton of cigarettes. When he returned home he sat at his workbench and contemplated his choices. In a short time his lighter and ashtrays were removed from the box and he began smoking again. Nothing anyone could say to him could get him to quit after that.  It was not long before he required oxygen just to get out of bed in the morning. He would sit in a chair in his room breathing from the tank until he was strong enough to dress. My grandmother then took the oxygen to the living room where he sat and breathed for a half hour or so. Once he felt up to it, he would sit out on the porch and have a smoke. Than it would be back on oxygen again until he could handle another cigarette.  This is how he finished his days, oxygen and tobacco, tobacco and oxygen. Until he fell into a coma which he never woke up from.  I often wonder how much more time he would have had with us if he had been able to keep away from the tobacco. He made the effort but his pride got in the way.

						   Summer 1972: Near where I spent my formative years was an abandoned convalescent hospital. Upon discovery it quickly became the hang out of choice for my friends and I.  Most of the buildings were two stories high and were perfect stand ins for military installations when we chose to play army. Our games were somewhat similar to capture the flag. We would divide ourselves into two teams and each team chose a building for their headquarters. The object was simple sneak past the other team and steal their flag.  One afternoon while in the middle of a battle we stumbled across a stairway that led down rather than up. Electricity was no longer fed into the building so nothing could be seen but darkness. We had no flashlights and though none of us would say it out loud we were somewhat scared of what appeared to be the basement.  For a short while the stairs were ignored and our battles continued unabated. Of course it was not long before the inevitable happened and exploring the basement became the challenge of the team who lost one of our battles.  As it happened my team lost the battle that afternoon and the three of us had to take up the dare or sneak home with our tales between our legs. Knowing we would never live it down we took our flashlights and descended into the darkness.  We explored for ten or fifteen minutes without discovering anything of real interest. The basement consisted mostly of offices and laboratories. Some old equipment and furniture was scattered about but all in all it was rather dull.   Or so we thought.  Just when we were about to return to the sunlight we found a second set of stairs that continued down into the darkness. We descended the stairs and came upon a closed door. There was a sign on the door and when the dust and the cobwebs were removed we found that it was the entrance to the morgue.  Our first instinct was to turn around but we ended up goading each other into continuing. We passed through the door and found ourselves in a long hallway. We checked several rooms and found more offices and one room that appeared to resemble an operating theater.  A sign on the wall directed us to the morgue, which was of course, the last door at the end of the hall. As we slowly moved forward it appeared that the door to the morgue was propped open. Our flashlights played along the corridor and by unspoken agreement came to rest on the floor in front of the morgue. Our silence grew so deep that you could have heard a pin drop.   We were looking at what appeared to be a white shoe, but not an abandoned shoe; no it had a foot and leg still in it. Our hearts felt like they were going to explode from our chests. We turned in unison and ran screaming from the building.  No one believed us at first, than when we had them convinced they somehow talked us into returning to the morgue with them so they could see for themselves. We made our way back down into the darkness and found the door had remained as we had left it. They saw the shoe and its contents but that was not good enough. Dares began running around the room until someone took up the challenge and went to open the door the rest of the way.  Taking two flashlights with him he approached the door. Along the way he found a discarded cane and used that to prevent himself from getting to close, just in case. He reached the door and pushed it open. Standing still as a statue he just seemed to stare for a moment and than he released an earth-shattering scream. Needing no further encouragement we broke all existing land speed records in our escape. When we had safely returned to the sunshine we fell panting to the ground.   Just as we were about to congratulate ourselves on our escape we realized we had returned one person short. Our friend who had opened the door was nowhere in site. However before we went into full panic mode he appeared laughing like there was no tomorrow. In his hand he held our "leg" which it turns out was nothing more than a prosthetic leg that someone had been left behind.

						   The ghost of his heart haunted her. Especially on rainy nights, when the raindrops fell through the leaves of the maple tree outside her bedroom window. Each precious drop of rain reminded her of the teardrops that had fallen from his empty eyes.  It was a blind date that had brought them together. She was cynical and her heart was more scar tissue than flesh. Battle wounds from the broken relationships she had experienced over the years. He was naÃ¯ve, surprisingly so, for someone his age. His heart was his prized possession and he worshiped it the way a miser worships his gold.  That first night together they spent sitting in the sand with the warm waters of the Pacific washing over their feet. They spoke of many things some serious some nonsense. They tried to count the stars and they watched quietly as the full moon danced with the crashing surf.   Despite herself she could feel some of the scar tissue softening, healing. She wanted to believe but history made that difficult. They returned to their cars with the rising of the sun. She was sure he would ask her out for a second date and she was just as sure that she would say no. Not because she did not like him but because she was afraid of him and what he represented.  He asked and she surprised herself by saying yes. He took her number and promised to call. He drove away without even trying to kiss her good by. This had floored her. Goodnight kisses were part of the ritual, part of the dance. It also intrigued her, what kind of guy would sit and talk with you through out the night without making at least one pass.  They dated for more than a month before he had kissed her good night. He may have moved slowly but she thought to herself it was worth the wait. They spent many evenings at the beach just talking and getting to know one another.  He was falling for her hard and that scared her. She was afraid of commitment, afraid of having her heart broken one more time. She was afraid of the pain.  One summer evening found them sitting around a small campfire somewhere in the Sierra's. With the moon and the stars as witnesses he dropped to one knee and asked her to be his wife.  She had know this moment was coming, had even expected it to be this weekend. In her dreams she had said yes over and over again. Now in the moment she found the word no had escaped her lips without conscious thought.  Once said a word like no in that situation cannot be taken back. She tried to explain herself but the words sounded hollow even to her. The look in his eyes scarred her heart more than any user ever could have. It was frightening because the look she saw was the same one she had seen in the mirror looking back at her every time her heart had been broken.   In unspoken agreement they packed their supplies and returned to the city. No words were exchanged for the entire three-hour drive. He left her in front of her apartment and she never heard from him again.  His heart though, his heart haunted her and spoke to her from the darkness each and every night. With each tear it cried it mocked her and reminded her that she had become what she most despised: a heartbreaker.

						   When I was eleven years old my best friend and I began work on what we considered the greatest tree house in the world.   The tree we chose was oak and one of several that were located on a hill in my backyard. This particular tree had two sets of v-shaped branches one set about five feet above the other which provided a perfect foundation and perfect roof support.  At the bottom of our street was an old bridge that was being torn out and replaced. The wood from the old bridge was set aside waiting to be hauled to the dump. So we were able to "borrow" as many boards as we needed. We scrounged our nails from an old reservoir that had become a dumping ground for the neighborhoods cast offs.  Once we began building we realized that we had enough wood and the perfect branches for a two-story tree house. Each floor was about 15 foot by 10 foot. Both floors were entered via doorways near the ladder. My parents were replacing the carpet in the house so we took the scraps and had wall-to-wall carpet in our tree house. We ran extension cords from the garage for electricity and we were set with all of the comforts of home.  We hauled an old screen door up to the top of a neighboring tree and that became our look out station. From there we could see any cars approaching our little street and keep tabs on whose parents were coming home and shout a warning to them.  In another tree just up the hill we had an old board swing that allowed the rider to just clear the top of the tree house. If they were daring enough they could leap from the swing and land on the roof.  Many summer nights were spent sleeping in that tree. We would tune our old AM radio to KHJ turn down the lights and tell ghost stories until we drifted off to sleep.   When I needed to escape the real world for a while I would bring a book and lay on the roof of the house and read for hours. Usually until the sun went down or until my mother called me for supper whichever came first.  After I moved out my brother, who was five years younger, tore down the old tree house and planned on building a new one but he never got around to it. Sometimes even now I wish I could climb back in that old thing and escape for a while.

						   He sat on the steps of the church. Enjoying the solitude that only late summer can bring. He was wearing a black tuxedo, collar open, bow tie undone. His eyes looked off into the distance without really seeing.  In the chapel behind him just one short hour ago he had given away his baby girl. Dressed in white and owning more beauty than any angel in heaven could claim. He had escorted her toward her future. A single tear in his eye as he glanced to the heavens wondering if her mother was watching and if she was as proud of her as he was.  Being the only child of single father could not have been easy for her. She had never known her mother who passed away before her first birthday. He had done his best to be all things to her: father, mother, sister and brother. He had sacrificed all he could to make her life as perfect as possible.   They were both blessed to have her aunt, his sister, who guided him whenever his parental compass led him astray. He had spent many long hours on the phone with her questioning his ability to raise such a precious child. His sister had always known when to listen and when to step in and give him some firm advice.  To his daughter, his sister had been not only aunt, but also big sister and confidant. When she had reached puberty and needed that feminine guidance she had been there for her. Guiding her through the minefield of hormones and teenagers. At times he had found himself jealous of their relationship but he buried that feeling deep within. Instinctually he understood that sometimes a girl just needs her mommy or a close substitute.  He had always known the day was coming when she would come home with MR. Right on her arm. He had made the usual jokes about shotguns and what he would do to anyone who strayed to close to his daughter. Inside though he was not sure how he was going to deal with the inevitable. Sometimes late at night he would wake up in a cold sweat filled with worry. At times like this he would ask for his wife's guidance. Speaking her name in silent prayer he always felt the comfort of the love they had briefly shared. Once calmed he would tiptoe into her room and watch her sleep. Snuggled with the old ratty teddy bear that she had slept with since she was a baby. At moments like that his soul overflowed with his love for her.  The day finally came when she brought Ben home and he knew without asking that he was the one. The way she looked at him reminded him so much of how her mother had looked at him. He was resistant at first but as time passed he admitted to himself that if she had to marry Ben was the perfect one for her. She had found her soul mate.  So here he sat on the steps of the church. Gathering himself before joining the celebration at the reception. He reached into his pocket and removed a small plastic bad. Within the bag was a lock of his baby's hair from her first haircut so many years ago. As he held her hair twenty-five years of memories washed over him.  He must of closed his eyes for when he opened them his beautiful daughter was reaching out her hand to him.  "Come on Pops, the dancing is just about ready to begin and the first dance belongs to the best man I have ever known, you."

						   I was drifting through our local farmers market this evening when I happened to overhear one of the officials that run the thing complaining to someone on her cellphone.  The gist of her point was that someone had without her permission set up a small table to collect signatures for a petition to improve the use of DNA in the solving of crimes. Her problem was that the issue was somewhat of a downer and should not be brought up where families gather.  The ironic part of this for me was that I had just past the petition table and they were set up next to a booth run by Forest Lawn designed to sell cemetary plots.

						   Memories of her had never quite left, they hid themselves in some dark quiet corner of his mind only to come bursting into the light when he least expected it.  Standing in a crowded elevator. Listening to office gossip when behind the voices his ears picked out a poorly recorded muzac version of "Desperado". He came close to tearing up when he realized that he had never come to his senses and let her love him.  Sitting in the stands at Chavez Ravine enjoying a Dodger game. When the seventh inning stretch begins and the first notes of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" are heard coming from the organ. The sound of 25,000 fans singing shoots him back to 1988 and game two of the world series against the A's. If he closes his eyes he can almost feel her hand in his, comfortable and warm. The music, the smells and his own memory almost convince him that when he opens his eyes she will be back at his side. His eyes open only to find a 65-year-old plumber from La Palma doing "the wave".  Lying on the couch one night using the remote to race around the dial. News, comedies, drama's nothing catches his eye. He stops suddenly sure that he recognizes the movie being shown. Two men, one in street clothes one in an old-fashioned baseball uniform are playing catch. He was right. It was one of his favorite scenes from "Field of Dreams". She had taken him to see it on the big screen for his birthday knowing how much he loved sports and movies. Sitting with her after the movie they had discussed the flood of memories the movie had brought out. Pick up games and little league. Baseball cards and Dodger games. For him the movie had captured his youth and preserved it for him. But now watching the ending he found himself crying not for the father and son on the screen but for himself and the mistakes he had made.  Now in the wisdom that only came with age and experience he could see what he had lost when he allowed his head to get in the way of his heart. She had loved him unconditionally and she made her choices based on that love and her belief that they would share forever together. She even accepted a scholarship to USC rather than Ohio State so she could be near him.  He on the other hand began to close doors as fast as she had opened them. He loved her but even though he was older he lacked her maturity. He was afraid. He was afraid of what he might miss if he settled down. He was afraid of the responsibility that she represented. Most of all he was afraid of that look in her eyes that said more than her words ever could.  So he ran. He hid. He cheated. And in the end he lost. While her love was strong and never ending her backbone prevented her from being a doormat. She took him to dinner at their favorite restaurant Ruby's at the end of the Balboa Pier. There they sat on the roof in the comfortable silence that only lover's seem to enjoy, sipping wine and watching the sunset into the Pacific.   He looked into her eyes and without her saying a word he knew he had stepped over the line one to many times. She took his face in her hands and gently kissed his lips one last time. She stood, turned and walked away without looking back. He would never see her again, the one who got away.

						   The first pitch of the baseball season never fails to transport me back to my youth. My memories are filled with evenings spent huddled under a blanket with my little transistor radio and an earplug. With Vin Scully calling the game one could close ones eyes and almost smell the peanuts and crackerjacks.  My parents were divorced and my father God love him was never much of a dad. He was not one for lazy days in the park or weekend visits to Disneyland. However I was always guaranteed several Saturday afternoons at the ballpark during the baseball season.  We would always arrive early for batting practice. Program in hand we would find our seats and I would begin to methodically enter the starting lineups for both teams. The one skill I learned from my father was keeping score. I could rattle off the current average for any Dodger including their most recent at bat.  If it was a good day my father would limit his beer intake and actually discuss the game with me. However his drinking at the game rarely bothered me as young as I was I still understood that his alcoholism was part of the package. If I wanted to see him I had to accept the drinking. Most nights it hardly bothered me. I was just ecstatic to be at Chavez Ravine.  The most memorable game I attended with my father was not even played in Los Angeles. One Saturday he picked me and instead of heading to the ballpark he took us to the airport. Once there we caught a flight to San Diego and a taxi to the stadium so we could enjoy a Dodger/Padre game. We had great seats and a great time. The dogs in San Diego did not match up to Dodger dogs but few do. It was just great to share the game with my dad.

						   Not unlike most young adults there came a time when I began to chaff under, what my immature mind defined as, the yoke of parental domination. My rebellion occurred in the spring of 1980.  I was dating a girl who lived in Las Vegas, which posed the usual problems of distance, and longing. Because of our conflicting schedules we were only able to see each other once every three months or so. Hence we spent many hours on the phone. Since she was a full time student and I was employed full time the onus was on me to do the dialing. I did not mind being young and in love, but my mother flipped when she saw the phone bill. My portion was over two hundred dollars for one month. Needless to say despite my age my parents came down on me and came down hard. They banned me from making any long distance calls from home. To which I argued that since I was giving them the money for my share of the bill they were being completely unreasonable. My mother agreed with the point that I was willing to pay the bill but she felt it was ludicrous for me to waste what amounted to almost one quarter of my monthly salary on phone calls. She went to say that it would be cheaper for me to fly to Vegas twice a month rather than chat for hours on the phone. Of course being young, dumb and stubborn I would not see it her way. I informed her that she was the worse mother on the planet and that it was high time that I moved out on my own. I walked away from the argument and made my big plans for the move.  Most of my friends still lived at home and were neither ready nor willing to move away from their security blanket. I was the only foolish one. However, I did know to brothers who had recently moved to Monrovia from Washington to work for their brother. After discussing it with them they were willing to rent me their couch, as neither was willing to share their room. I readily agreed, as I was anxious to begin life on my own.  D and G were good guys and even better friends. Living with them was a party waiting to happen and I was always being exposed to something new. That being said they were the roommates from hell. If I had gone into this move with my eyes open I would have been on my knees before my mother begging for forgiveness and my room back. Instead I cut the cord and moved away.  My first tour of the apartment was a real eye opener. If the five rooms had been mysteriously transported to a war zone they would have fit right in. If a twister had blown through it could have only improved the place. Knowing that I was going to be living in the public portion of the apartment I realized that my work was cut out for me.  I began with the living room also known as my bedroom. There were what appeared to be a years worth of the Los Angeles Times scattered about in various piles. As I saw it I had two choices. I could leave the newspapers where they were by some shellac and pour it over the various piles creating a set of end tables and a coffee table. My second choice and the one I made was to spend several hours bagging the newsprint and hauling it down to the garbage.  Beneath the scattered papers were shoes, shirts, and dishes that had been lost in the clutter. Those were distributed to their proper location. In one corner I found an old planter with what once may have been a miniature palm. Amazingly enough though the leaves were brown and faded the stalk appeared to be clinging to life. The soil in the pot was covered by three inches of cigarette butts, beer caps and golf tees. I am happy to report that once the debris was removed, new soil added and regular waterings begun that palm actually returned to life. Now came the living rooms most difficult task. Cleaning the carpet. D and G worked at a tile factory and came home from work covered in clay. It appeared that the carpet had never been cleaned since they had moved in. It took me seven hours and five vacuum cleaner bags to remove all of the debris, but at least the room was now livable.  If the living room was bad the kitchen cried out for white suited toxic waste specialist to do their stuff. Apparently the brother owned silver ware and dinnerware plus a pan set but they did not own a sponge. Every dish, utensil and pan was dirty and pile in the sink. I felt like an archeologist as I worked my way through layers of debris. Colonies of life were disturbed and various bacteria's became homeless. Eventually, after hours of labor the sink was conquered and once again their plates were a location safe enough to eat off of. The freezer, one that required defrosting, was so frosted over one ice tray would fill all usable space. The refrigerator held several plastic bags containing what appeared to have once been lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers. Of course without scientific testing anyone could have sworn to that fact. There was also one Tupperware container that seemed to be seeing how many different colored molds could be cultivated in one dish. In actuality cleaning the refrigerator and freezer was the easiest task. Everything was thrown away. A blow dryer was used to melt the ice build up. The unit was unplugged fumigated, aired out and returned to service.  Tales from their bathroom have been know to bring the cleaning staff from local bars to their knees in fear of facing what once existed in that small but toxic room. In consideration for those with weak stomachs and vivid imaginations I will refrain from describing that room in any detail.  Living with D and G was a great learning experience for me even if I did feel somewhat Felix Ungerish by the time I moved on. Beginning my time away from home with the roommates from hell prepared me for life on my own and for that I will always be thankful.

						   The broken body lay there Silhouetted upon the paper Trying to survive the torturous pain Trying to escape the driving rain No pity, No one cared Looking back, they could only stare They give it a thought But no, love cannot be bought So they quickly turn away Nothing left to say  The rain stopped The war was fought One casualty Dying from brutality A lonely boy Destroyed the wing Now the bee Would never fly or sing Just death Without a tear  d.s. brueckner 2004

						   Why do people insist on entering into less than perfect situations with the expectation that things will improve for the better down the road? For example:  I don't like the color you chose for the living room but maybe it will grow on me. He isn't perfect but if I stick with him perhaps he will change. She is not happy now but if I buy her this ring maybe she will be. I really don't like that restaurant but maybe if I keep eating there the food will improve.  Or the one that set me off on this rant. People who buy knowingly buy a house in a neighborhood that is less than perfect. Such as a family who buys property near a large airport than complains because the planes are too loud.  In today's San Gabriel Valley Tribune there is an article concerning such a situation. On the border between the cities of Azusa and Duarte (both are located about twenty-five miles east of Los Angeles) is a private gun club.  The San Gabriel Valley Gun Club has been in its present location since 1946, about 48 years.   Over the past twenty or so years the city of Azusa has been slowly making its way into the Foothills growing ever closer to the gun club. The newest housing tract, Mountain Cove, is located just across the canyon from the range.  When the new homes were purchased each resident was informed in writing of the gun clubs existence and its hours of operation, which are from 8:30 AM to 4:45 PM seven days a week. Each and every owner purchased his or her property knowing this.  Now the owners led by a Mr. C. are petitioning the city council to have the gun club moved. According to Mr. C. "he saw the warnings but times have changed and the gun club should get out because so many homes are within earshot."  Personally I am not a gun owner nor do I ever plan to be one. However I am sick and tired of a small group of people, the homeowners in this case, whining and crying because they want to be coddled to. The gun club members have minded their own business for 48 years, but I am sure that once people like Mr. C. complain enough the city council will cave and force the gun club to move.  What ever happened to the old saying buyer beware.

						   Summer 1976: I was sixteen and my parents trusted me enough to leave me home alone for the weekend.   Being a fairly boring teenager I did not want to test fate and lose the faith my parents had placed in me. So I followed the rulebook to a T. No friends over, no drinking, nothing just a quiet weekend at home. If I took the car out I was to make sure I was back before dark.  I watched a little television, brought a pizza home and did what I always do, lost myself in a book. This particular weekend it was the novelization of the movie The Omen written by David Seltzer. I had yet to see the film so the book had captured my attention and I could not put it down.  My brother and I shared a room and for the first time I had the room to myself. So eleven o'clock on Saturday night found me lying in my bed finishing the story. Damian and the evil satanic forces had eliminated everyone and the antichrist was free to continue growing. The book had somewhat creeped me out but I was tired and ready for a good nights sleep. I turned out the light buried myself beneath the covers and attempted to lose myself in dreamland.  Something was bothering me though. For some reason I began to feel I was being watched. I ignored the feeling assigning blame to The Omen.  I could not ignore it though. The feeling became stronger and stronger. I tightly wrapped myself in my blankets and buried my head beneath the pillow. Nothing worked sleep would not come and I just knew something was wrong.  I slowly pulled the covers back and raised my head off of the pillow. I turned towards my brother's bed and then I saw it. An evil red glow was coming from beneath the bed and projecting itself upon the ceiling. In my imagination I could almost hear the gates of hell opening.  My heart began pounding and I must have turned whiter than new fallen snow. I sprang from my bed and ran through the house turning on every light, radio and television. I went to my parent's room, which was the farthest point possible I could reach from mine. I sat on their bed and collected my thoughts. Once I could think logically I knew that nothing evil was under my brother's bed. But convincing myself to go check took nearly an hour of silent debate.  Finally I gathered my wits and slowly returned to my room. With a yardstick I found in the closet I lifted my brothers blanket from the floor and tossed it onto the bed. I lowered myself to my hands and knees and took a quick peak underneath. To quick I did not see anything.  So I took a deep breath laid myself flat on the floor and foundâ€¦  My brothers red t-shirt covering a flashlight that he had been playing with and forgot to turn off.

						   She sits on the rocks above the river. Jet boats and water skiers dance across the current. The hot desert sun slowly roasts the back of her neck. Mosquito dive bombers attack her ankles and bare arms leaving small craters in her skin.  None of these worldly distractions can bring her back from her spiritual quest.  She has spent years searching the highways and byways of many lands for answers to questions she has yet to pose. From the mountains of Tibet to the Ganges river in India. From St. Peter's in Rome to the mosques and temples of the Middle East. From Stonehenge in the land of the Celts to Machu Pichu in the Americas. Each holy shrine she visited seemed to have a small piece of the puzzle. It was as if some ancient race of giants had upended a box of spiritual clues and scattered them to the wind. Lately, however it seemed like the more pieces she collected the more difficult the puzzle had become.  Her journey had at last come full circle and she had returned to her own beginnings. She had always found solace here beside the mighty Colorado. Her first baby steps of her spiritual life had taken place not to far from where she now sat. When a Shaman from a local indian tribe found her meditating beside the river, he had taken her under his wing and planted the seeds that had led to her quest.  His most precious gift had come forth when he taught her how to silence her mind and body and allow the song of her soul to be heard. In doing so she had not only improved her listening skills but   had begun the first steps on the long road of meditation. Over the years as her ability to meditate improved the oung of her soul had becomer clearer.   So here she sat attuned to the universe her only desire one of spiritual truth.   In the suns embrace she grew relaxed and in the caress of the river's song she felt cleansed. Her mind withdrew from the here and now and at long last she released her soul to dance with the winds.  Soaring above the clouds she spotted Brother Eagle. She explained to him the purpose of her journey and she asked him if he knew how to recreate the puzzle. He appeared to have an answer but before he could share it he spotted dinner and set off in pursuit of an unsuspecting field mouse.  On the horizon she spotted Brother Wolf and she joined him on the ground. She explained to him the purpose of her journey and asked him if he knew the puzzles solultion. However just as he was about to answer the moon began to rise and he had to join the pack for a group howl.  Soaring again in the twilight sky she spotted Sister Owl just awakening from her days sleep. She explained to her the purspose of her quest and asked if she knew the origin of the puzzle. Sister Owl was sympathetic to her plight but the cries of her hungry owlettes prevented her from providing assistance.  Below her she spotted Sister Coyote pause at the riverbank for a drink of water. She explained to her the quest she had undertook and asked if she had any insight she could share concerning her spiritual puzzle. Sister Coyote though wise appeared to be uninterested in her plight and soon left her behind in her chase of a nocturnal rabbit.  Taking flight she became aware of a glow coming from the cliffside of a nearby mountain. She followed the light and soon found her self in the presence of  her friend the shaman. For a moment she paused unsure of her next move. She had received the news on her journey that the shaman had passed away but here he was. Setting aside her fear she joined her friend on the cliff face.  Before she could begin the shaman smiled at her with his wise old eyes glowing and began to speak.  My daughter for one who has put before herself such a great task, you  are much to impatient. The spiritual unity of this planet was broken while the earth was still young. You have accomplished much by finding the roots of the various religions. However your quest has just begun. In order to reassemble the pieces one must have the help of many enlightened souls. This is a task you cannot complete on your own. Before you can recreate what once was one must assist other in relearning their own soul songs. When the time is right your sould will guide you to me once again and I will aide you in the first steps of spiritual recreation. Go with love my daughter.  She came back to herself on the rock beside the river. The evening sky was filled with a billion stars and the moon was smiling down at her. For a moment she contemplated giving up her quest and just laying beneath the stars for an eternity and a half. But soon enough she returned her backpack to her shoulders and continued her journey.

						   Many grains of sand passed through the hourglass before he returned to Oak Hill Park. The summers of his youth had been spent in the playground and the pools that made Oak Hill Park such a great place to grow up.  As her walked through the park his memory appeared to be playing tricks on him. The pool was smaller than he remembered. The high dive was shorter. The tennis courts were not as grand. Even the statue that had represented the first settlers in this valley had been taken away. Worst of all, the playground no longer resembled the playground of his youth. Gone were the rocket ship and the merry-go-round replaced by the new wave of "kid friendly" toys, odd shaped bars with small slides and rings with padding covering everything. Even the height of the swings had been reduced, no longer could the boys and girls soar high into the sky pretending to be astronauts and fighter pilots. These new fangled swings have no lift what so ever.  He circled the playground, dismayed at the changes that time had inflicted upon his favorite hang out. Realistically he knew that nothing lasted forever, but recently he had found that many places he remembered from his youth either no longer existed or had changed almost beyond recognition. Wandering through the haunts of his youth was beginning to make him feel old.   Eventually he found himself laying back on the grass and watching the clouds chase each other across the sky. In his minds eye he could still see the rocket ship and his ten-year-old self sitting on the top level reading a worn copy of "Treasure Island". So many years had passed since then, so much water under the bridge. With a sigh he turned towards the bare sand where the merry-go-round used to sit. He remembered spinning for hours watching the leaves passing over head in a blur until dizziness forced him to bail out. He would collapse in the sand, turn on to his back and it was as if he could feel the entire world spinning beneath him.  His thoughts turned to that innocent ten-year-old that he had once been. If right here, right now the stars came into some weird type of cosmic alignment that somehow allowed me to communicate with him what would I say. What nuggets of hard earned wisdom would I share with the past? A very interesting question indeed.  He lay there in the grass and allowed his thoughts to follow the slippery slopes of Mount What If. So much has happened since I was that innocent child. Some of it great, some of it good and of course some of it bad.  Well he thought, I would most definitely tell him to avoid Interstate 70 on March 2, 2001, no reason we shouldn't avoid that accident if we can. I would tell him to hang out at home longer. To give himself enough time to get his act together before fleeing the family nest. I would definitely advise making better choices in room mates and avoiding the whole small claims route. And of course I would let him know that he could save himself a lot of embarrassment by not asking Lisa Ryan to the prom in front of the entire world and being shot down.  Hmm what else is worth passing along he wondered. What should I tell him about the marriage and the divorce? What could I tell him about being a father? I definitely should remind him to spend enough time with his parents and grand parents before time and age take them away. Should I mention career choices and financial lessons?   The more he pondered this scenario the more he realized that in reality he would not pass on any of his original ideas to his past self. If it were possible to pass information back in time it would be simple to warn himself about all of the mistakes he/they had made. It would be simple but it would not be right.  No if I could pass along a message to the past it would be simply to remind my former self to take the time to stop and smell the roses. Each event he/they had lived through were lessons that had been learned. Change the event and just maybe the lesson would be lost and a chance would be wasted. Forget the marriage and lose the joy of the kids. Forget the great prom question and lose the courage to approach someone you would like to know better. No, in reality he would if he could pass along a one word message: ENJOY.  As he turned his back on the playground and walked away he could almost hear the squeaks of the merry-go-round and the joyous laughter of yesterday's children.

						   AJ and I met during our freshman year at MHS. We were in the same study hall and our friendship developed through out that first semester. AJ came from a hunting and camping family. He could play guitar and wrote some of his own material. My background was citified with no musical talent what so ever. Our common ground was founded on a love of good books and the joy of a good debate. During lunch hour and after school we would spend hours in friendly arguments that ranged from politics to the environment to finally religion.  AJ it turns out was an atheist. In my short life he was the first person I had met who professed a disbelief in the existence of God. As for myself I was born and raised in the Catholic church. Upon reaching high school I had begun to question some of the tenants of my religion I never questioned the existence of God. Rather than driving a wedge into our newfound friendship our different religious backgrounds allowed us to have many spirited but friendly debates on the subject.  AJ was by his own description somewhat of a Darwinist. He believed in evolution and natural selection. He professed that the only explanation for the existence of the universe was the big bang. His favorite subjects were all scientific in nature. Upon graduation he planned to go on to college and study medicine with the intention of becoming a doctor.  However as often happens on the road of life, the best-laid plans have a way of swerving off course into entirely new directions. For AJ the slow approach of change began in our senior year.  For most of high school AJ had been an all books no nonsense type of guy. His focus had prevented him from becoming seriously involved in any social activities including dating. That was before he met Teri.   AJ and Teri found themselves in the same class first semester of our senior year. They began spending time together at school. Studying in the library, eating lunch under one of the oak trees and saving seats for each other before school events. AJ was smitten and it appeared that love would soon be blooming. That was before fate played its trump card.  Prom season was just around the corner and AJ planned on attending and asking Teri to be his date. One obstacle remained for the hopefully so to be happy couple. Through out the many hours of conversation during our senior year they never once discussed religion. When AJ finally asked Teri to the prom that proved to be the topic that would make our break their relationship.  Teri has it turned out was a Jehovah's Witness and regardless of her personal feelings her parents would not allow her to date outside of her religion. She explained that the prom was to soon for him to be accepted. But if he began to come to church with her they would eventually be able to date.  AJ had always been sure of his beliefs when it came to God. He was also an honest and trustworthy person who would never deceive someone just to go out on a date. So I was sure that her ultimatum would be the end of them. I was wrong. AJ explained to her that he had never believed in God but that he would keep an open mind and attend church with her. True to his word he began attending church, going to bible study and spending time with her family.  AJ and Teri eventually began dating and all was right with the world. Their relationship lasted for several months but as often happens with young love they eventually grew apart and went their separate ways.  Surprisingly though his time spent attending Teri's church had not been wasted. AJ developed a spiritual thirst and without conscious thought set out on a personal spiritual quest.  Several months after AJ and Teri broke up he met Samantha. They began dating and he began attending church with her and her family. Sam and her family were Mormon's and they welcomed AJ with open arms. Sam and AJ went to youth group activities together. They studied the Bible and the Book of Mormon. But AJ had just begun his quest and he was not finding all the answers that he thirsted for. Eventually Sam moved on and so did AJ.  Sean who was a mutual friend of ours was Roman Catholic like myself. However while my family had kept their relationship with the church strictly in the pews Sean's family was involved in all aspects of the church. They began inviting AJ to bible studies and to their parish for Sunday mass. Sean and I had begun attending mass with a youth group at our college and AJ was soon tagging along.  After several months of being ministered to AJ with his newly discovered belief in God decided to commit to the Catholic Church and was baptized. Sean's mother and father were his godparent and no one appeared to be happier about this than AJ himself.  However, AJ had not quite reached the end of his journey on the road less traveled. There were still a few surprises in store for our former atheist.  During this period of religious growth AJ was attending the university working towards becoming a doctor. His grades were good and upon graduation he was planning on going to medical school. That was before he met Mary.  With Mary and AJ it was love at first sight. She lived next door to his mother's house and they began spending time together. Mary belonged to a Non-Denominational Christian church and AJ began attending with her whenever he spent the weekend with his mom. Slowly but surely his beliefs once again began to evolve. While his newfound belief in God was solid his roots in the Catholic Church were young and questioning. He began to find himself more at home in Mary's church than his own and soon he became a full time member.  Not to long after AJ joined Mary's church he gave me a call. We met for dinner and had one of our usual debate filled conversations. Before long we slipped into a discussion about religion and the role it had played in our friendship and most importantly in his life. ThatÃ‚Â’s when he dropped not one but two bombshells on me. Bombshell number one was that he had asked Mary to be his wife and she had accepted. Bombshell number two was that after much though and prayer he was abandoning his dream of becoming a doctor and going to the seminary to become a minister. After I picked myself off of the floor I congratulated him on his good fortune in finding someone like Mary to share his life with and I told him that I believed he would be a great minister because he had traveled a long and varied road to reach this point in time. And that the experience he had lived through would only increase the empathy he would have for his flock.  That was twenty some odd years ago. AJ is the pastor of a fairly large church in the Midwest. He and Mary are still married and they have four children two of their own and two adopted. To listen to the man today you would never know that once upon a time he was a fourteen-year-old boy who professed to be an atheist. Life is nothing if not full of surprises.

						   He walked up the hill, hugging the side of the road. No sidewalks had been grown in this part of town and with all the blind curves one never knew what a car might do. Especially at twilight when the old pines create shadows that can confuse the senses of the commuters making their daily trek home.  He felt a certain serenity come over his soul as the road turned and he caught site of "his" wall. After all these years it still looked the same. Rocks with character had been pulled from a nearby streambed and cemented together to form the northern boundary of someone's property.   As a teenager this wall had been his place of refuge. Perched atop it he could see the valley below a patchwork quilt that stretched for miles. As the sunset he would hold his breath in anticipation of the dazzling display of city lights that would seem to miraculously appear before him.  It was here that he came to cry when he experienced his first broken heart. Probably the second and third one to if he was honest with himself. When the pressure at home became too much this is where he would hide. Silently cursing parents and siblings alike. Wanting the freedom that came with age but longing to hide once more in his mother's arms while she assured him that there were no monsters under his bed.  And now it was to this wall that he had returned. To find himself somewhere amongst all of the stereotypes he had become. He could not even be sure that his old self was still there buried in a pile of childish memories that had been discarded when adulthood called. He had learned his life's lessons so well. Lately he had begun to feel like one of those false fronts they have at all of the movie studios. From the front they appear to be real buildings but look inside and there is nothing to be found just empty space. That is what his heart and soul had become empty space.  Sitting here on the wall he could almost sense the presence of a specter from his past. His younger self who was not afraid of tears, who could cry while reading a book, or watching a movie or just because he felt like it. The one who wrote poetry and dreamt of fatherhood. The one who still believed in love and happily ever after. If only his younger self could see what they had become. So important, so successful, a life filled with material goods. Yet it was a life that now more than ever was filled with emptiness.   He could not remember the last time he had shed a tear. Or the last time he had read a good book. He thought of movies like "Old Yeller", how he had cried and cried when they had to put Yeller down. What happened to that child of emotion? Where had he gone? Why had he let him go? Good questions all but he had no answers.  Sighing he turned and began his lonely walk down the hill. Listening to the crickets sing and owls begin their nightly sojourn. Out of the darkness he heard the squeal of breaks and than he saw the lights of a car as it came around the corner. He stepped onto someone's driveway to so the driver would have plenty of room. Once the car passed he continued around the corner and stopped. There by the side of the road lay a squirrel that must have just been hit because as he watched the squirrel shuttered as it took its last breath.  He just stood there staring at the poor thing. He removed his t-shirt and used it to gently wrap the squirrels broken body. As he cradle the creature his eyes filled with tears and he began to cry. His shoulders shook with emotion and his breath came in great sobs.  He continued down the hill until he came to a vacant lot. He found an old bucket and began to dig a grave. All the while his tears fell turn the dry dust into mud. When he was finished he gently laid the squirrel in the hole still wrapped in his shirt and quietly recited a small prayer.  Silently he shoveled the dirt over the body and than he placed several rocks on top to prevent the coyotes from digging the squirrel up. Quietly crying he slowly made his way to his car. The tears had been cathartic. He did not know if this was the beginning of a new path or just a slight detour before he returned to the rut he had been trapped in. Either way the emotional release was good for him and he hoped a sign of things to come.

						   Candlelight danced with the shadows, a waltz to music only the spirits could hear. Victoria sat in her grandmother's rocker wrapped in a quilt draped with one of her favorite books "Rapture in Death" open on her lap.  In the fireplace logs from the maple tree that had come down in the big windstorm cracked and popped with delight. Providing the room with warmth and a sense of home. The comfort that surrounded her was lost on Victoria as tears slipped from her eyes and fell to the unread pages below.  Her heart and soul were still trying to come to grips with the end of her most recent romance. Everything had been going so well.  Life with him had been filled with candlelit dinners, walks in the surf and dancing in the moonlight to the crooning sounds of Sinatra. All she had ever dreamed of. Now there was an empty place at the table, cold sand between her toes and a phonograph needle soundlessly spinning.  Victoria had come here to her little hideaway in Vermont to examine her life and attempt to rebuild her broken heart. Introspection was not her forte and she found it difficult to do more than feel sorry for herself. Reviewing the broken battleground of her fractured relationships was a task best suited for an archeologist not a thirty-year-old woman who still believed in fairy tales and the eminent arrival of Prince Charming.   Experience was said to be one of life's great teachers. All she had to show for her dive into the fast lane of love was a heart that had been portioned and broken so many times that it had begun to resemble a geologists guide to fault zones. Apparently she had failed to learn anything from her experience except how to continue to make the same mistake over and over again.  If the past continued to repeat itself she would not even have to live through the relationship the plot points were as apparent as the story line for every teen horror movie ever made. She would return to the city. For a few weeks her and the girls would spend their weekends dining, drinking and clubbing. One day a new pretty boy would rear his handsome head. Her lust would overrule both her mind and a new relationship would spring to life. They would embark on several weeks of whispered passion and midnight rendezvous'. Before long her mind would brainwash her heart into believing that her latest boy toy was the one. Mr. Boy Toy would have other ideas however and as soon as she became serious he would find a reason to move on.  Suddenly Victoria slammed the cover of her book shut. She threw the quilt to the floor and began to roam the room snuffing the flame on each and every candle. In her mind she began repeating a new mantra, "no more, no more, no more." She went to the closet and removed several shoe boxes filled with dusty memories of yesterdays broken hearts. Sitting on the floor near the fire Victoria began to systematically open the boxes, remove the trinkets, photographs, and letters tossing them one by one into the fire. As each box was emptied her soul began to feel just a bit lighter.  Her phonebook was the next to feel the heat of her hearts fury. Phone numbers and email addresses sacrificed to the goddess of lost dreams. Turning from the fire Victoria went to the hallway grabbed a sweater and ventured out into the moonlit night. Head down she began walking one foot in front of the other; mile after mile, until she reached the maple trees that marked the end of her property. She sat with her back against an old boulder still warm from the day's sun. The night sky called and her mind responded soaring amongst the stars searching for truth.  In her soul however the truth was there for the taking. In the darkness Victoria began to see the light. Forgiveness was the first step on the road she hoped to travel. Her heart was heavy with the bitterness she felt towards her past lovers. That bitterness must be discarded. Her heart was scarred with self inflicted wounds not the fault of those who left but the fault of the one who made choices out of fear rather than love. As awareness of her own culpability came to the surface the scars on her heart softened and began the slow healing process.  Out of the ashes of Victoria's damaged heart a phoenix began to rise. Shedding the wounds of yesterday and embracing the hope of tomorrow. In the silence of a winter's night she was finally beginning to understand the melody to her souls song. She and only she was responsible for her string of broken hearts. By allowing the "it" factor of society to define for her the meaning of love and beauty she had abdicated the free will she had received from her creator. She had surrendered to fear and accepted loneliness.  Looking up at the full moon Victoria shouted her new mantra for the world to hear "no more." From this moment forward I will live with love and cast aside fear. My heart, mind and soul will walk in solidarity together as one awash in the light of my newfound understanding. And God willing somewhere along this road I will find a pilgrim who like me is on a quest for a soul who's melody will blend seamlessly with theirs. Until that day though I will be content to lose myself in the rhythms of the universes song.

						   The recent passing of Tony Randall dropped me into a sea of memories.  In the early seventies my Friday nights were always spent with my grandparents. Nana would fix dinner than she would take a nap before heading off to work. My grandfather would do the dishes and sit in the kitchen with a cigarette, a cup of coffee and a magazine, usually the Readers Digest.  I could be found curled up on the couch lost in a good book. About eight o'clock my grandfather would join me in the living room, turn the TV to ABC (his preferred network) and sit back in his avocado green recliner. We never talked much. I would continue reading occasionally glancing at whatever happened to be on.  About nine fifteen he would return to the kitchen and fix us both a good-sized bowl of vanilla ice cream swimming in caramel. He would return with our dessert and together we would satisfy our sweet tooth while he laughed his way through his favorite show "The Odd Couple".  I really do not remember the show all that well. However, anytime I hear the theme song or catch a glimpse of one of the episodes it is like being thrown into a time machine and being sent back to 1971.   Though I never met him I would like to take this opportunity to thank Tony Randall and of course Jack Klugman for the Friday nights I shared in quiet companionship with my grandfather. They are memories that will remain with me always.

						   Ghostlike he roams the hallways. Ignored by the living, the popular, the jocks and even the nerds. He is a clique of one. School is both his greatest joy and his most bitter curse. He thrives in the academic environment but he is being torn apart by his loneliness. There are no friends for him to turn to. No clubs that want him as a member. Even teachers overlook him in the classroom and fail to notice him in the halls.  In the classroom, he sits in the front row. Pencil in hand taking notes and absorbing all of the knowledge his teachers have to share. Though he is a straight A student he has never possessed the confidence needed to raise his hand in class. Though he knows all of the answers is voice is never heard.  In gym class he prowls the sidelines. Watching as the other boys bond and grow together.  His mind aches with the desire to belong, but he lacks the courage to stand up and demand his place in the game.  During lunch while the others join in various circles of gossip and jocularity he finds a quiet corner. Back against a tree he is soon lost in the worlds of Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke and Heinlen. In his minds eye he imagines himself the hero of one of their grand space operas. Slaying the hideous aliens and rescuing the beautiful princess. All to soon however the lunch bell rings and returns him to his bitter reality.  All of the solitude has begun to take a toll on him. Most days at some point he will find himself in a graffiti filled stall quietly sobbing tears of despair. He has become so desperate for attention that he has begun to wish that the bullies would pay atleast notice him. Give him a wedgey. Tape a "kick me" sign to his back. Trip him in the hallway. Though he knew that it was a wasted wish for some reason he was not even worth the contempt of the bullies.  Being a realist he knows that many teenagers, who found themselves outcast, broke and fell into drinking, drugs and even suicide. Others broke and brought a gun to school ensuring that everyone would soon be paying attention. He was more fortunate than either group. He may be a nobody at school but he has a very good reason for living.  Each afternoon when he returned from he would find her looking out the front window watching for him. She was his older sister whose body had been so ravaged by disease that she could no longer even communicate. Tossing his books aside he would give her a kiss and sit at the foot of her wheel chair. Her still bright eyes would light up as he filled her with tales of his scholastic adventures. Not the truth of course. Outside the house he may have been a nobody but to her he was and always would be somebody.

						   Spring 1969: After my parents divorce the one thing my father and I continued to share was our love of baseball. Several times each season he would pick me up and take me to Dodger Stadium. We would sit in the bleachers eat our Dodger dogs. My dad had taught how to keep score so we always purchased a program and I would sit there and concentrate on every pitch ensuring that each moment of the game was duly noted. Dad would mostly watch the game and sip his beer. Though an alcoholic he kept his drinking under control when we were at the games.  One Saturday he showed up at the house and told me we were going to the ballgame. It dawn on me until we were already on the road but I realized the Dodger's were out of town and I told him so. He just chuckled and said with a smile if the Dodgers aren't at the ravine we will have to find them.   Before long we arrived at Burbank Airport, now I was really confused. Without a word my dad led me to the boarding area for a flight to San Diego. He explained that since the Padres were now part of the National League he figured we should hop down the coast and check out the new stadium. We boarded the plane and for the first time my young eyes took in Los Angeles from the air. I was speechless. I felt like John Glenn as we took to the skies. I pointed out Dodger Stadium and the freeways and ocean and I am sure before long my dad was tired of my running monologue but he never said a word.  Just as I was getting used to the excitement of being in the air we arrived in San Diego. We caught a cab and arrived at the stadium just in time for the national anthem. We had field box seats on the third base side and our section was pretty deserted. Of course the dogs weren't as good as the ones served at Dodger stadium but they never are. I didn't care I was in baseball heaven.  I was so excited by all of the day's activities that I even forgot to keep score. I sat in my seat and savored each and every moment of the game. I even came close to catching a foul ball however about twenty of kids dived for it at the same time and I did not manage to be the one to come up with it. I didn't mind though I was at the ballpark with my dad and all was right with the world.  All to soon the game ended and we were in the taxi on our way back to the airport. Neither of us said much we just sat in comfortable silence. We boarded the plane and I was lost in the city lights spread out below us on the flight home.  Before I knew we were back at the house and my dad was walking me to the door. I thanked him for the great time and gave him a big hug. He gave my head a rub and walked back to the car.  I did not know it then but that would be the last ball game my dad and I would share. Before that summer came to a close he moved out of Southern California. He passed away in 1980 and I never had a chance to say good by.

						   I looked up into the clear blue sky and I saw an angel looking down He had golden wings and silver hair but on his face he wore a frown So I looked up at my guardian angel and I asked him why are you so sad He just looked at me with tear filled eyes, I never knew angels could feel so bad Than in a sorrowful voice he said itâ€™s the way things are today So much is going wrong  people believe that God's gone away There is crime in the city, hate in the schools, fathers who won't stay There are children in the street, without a chance, using drugs to chase the pain away There are worms in the water, smog in the air, the Amazons begun to disappear There are holes in the ozone, no violence free zones, humanity is living in fear He said, heavens no longer a happy place, we are filled with such despair Our hearts are heavy, our songs are sad, you see we angels truly care  With that he turned as if to go and I knew I had to speak I couldn't let him fly away without the answers he seemed to seek So I spoke to him with a hope filled voice and he stopped to hear me out  I know our worlds not the perfect place you in heaven wished it would be But in the beginning when the planets were young God he set our will free He said go out and explore the world discover what's wrong and right All I ask in return is that you seek out heavens light Now I know sometime we all forget about heaven and its glory I know there are those who no longer believe, they say God is just a story Still there is so much good on earth don't let the bad bring you down There are plenty of people filled with love just have a look around When a natural disaster strikes a country down anywhere on this earth It does not matter what they believe they find out what a man is worth Money, food, clothes or shelter, sometimes just a prayer All flow into that battered country showing that we truly care There are everyday moments that we all believe are signs of all that's good Sunsets and rainbows, rainstorms and snow or the smell of freshly cut wood There are bird songs, love songs and silly songs for fun There is a baby at birth, a baby's first words or a child learning to run There is love at first sight, falling in love and a walk down the marriage road There are horses and cows, puppies and kittens and even a horned back toad There is the first flower of spring, the last leaf of fall and moonlit winter nights There is help for the homeless, hope for the afflicted and those who protect human rights There is baseball, basketball, football and more, so much to keep our bodies strong There is algebra, chemistry, astronomy and more, designed to help the mind along There is life, death and everything that helps make this world go 'round  And then I seemed to lose my breath my voice stopped without a sound I looked up at my guardian angel and I saw that his tears no longer hit the ground He said, I guess in heaven we just have dismissed all of the little things We have forgotten how to appreciate the joy that life can bring I guess there truly is hope for this world and God's creations  And then he turned and flew away with a smile that made my heart sing I guess now even angels understand the joy that life can bring

						   As of late, Jacob had found himself looking forward to retirement. After fifty years he had begun to wonder whether or not the path he had chosen in life was the right one. Not that he ever really had a choice. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather before him had all been lighthouse keepers and from his birth it had always been expected that he would follow in his families footsteps.   He loved the sea and never really gave serious thought to straying from his plotted course. After serving two years in the Coast Guard he returned home to replace his father has keeper of the Cambria Lighthouse. In the fifties when he began, lighthouse keeping was still a career that offered challenges.  He could remember many nights when his light and foghorn had been all that separated the ships sailing California's Central Coast from disaster. After spending the night monitoring the radio he would go to sleep in the morning with the feeling of a job well done.  Like many careers lighthouse keeping had changed over the years. With the advent of computer and satellite navigation the service he provided had become somewhat redundant. At night he would still turn on the light and if the weather called for it the foghorn. However this was done more out of tradition than need. He had no children so once he retired he was not even sure whom, if anyone would replace him. Cambria Lighthouse may just become a museum reflecting the lifestyles of an era gone by. The bottom line was that he did not feel needed. Like his lighthouse he had become an antique.  Jacob shook his head, what am I accomplishing by sitting here and feeling sorry for myself. He got up from his old rocker and climbed down the stairs to get the mail. There was a small pile waiting for him inside the door. He gathered it up and took it outside to sit in the sun while he sorted through the junk. Bills, bills, more bills and one letter. He could not remember the last time he had received a personal letter. He looked at the envelope it was addressed simply to:  Lighthouse Keeper Cambria Lighthouse Cambria, California  His curiosity piqued he opened the letter, it was written in pencil and by a youngster's hand. He began to read.  Dear Lighthouse Keeper,  My name is Kevin and I am thirteen years old. I just wanted to thank you for saving my father and me. About three months ago we were sailing from San Francisco to San Diego. When we reached the Central Coast it was night and very foggy. The ocean was silent except for the sound of the waves lapping against our boat. Visibility was limited to about three feet in any direction. My father was considering waiting out the fog when he had a mild heart attack. I had no choice I had to take over and get him to shore as soon as possible. I attempted to radio for help but our radio would not work. At that moment I felt more alone than I ever had before. I began to panic. I was sure my father was going to die. Just than out of the darkness I heard the low moan of a foghorn. I turned my head just in time to catch the light from your lighthouse. I took down the sails like my father had taught me. I then started our little outboard motor and navigated toward the shore using the foghorn and light to stay on course. Once I could hear the surf I turned parallel to the coast and maintained that course until I came to a marina. My father was taken to the hospital. We are both alive today because of your dedication in maintaining the Cambria Lighthouse. Thank you very much.  Kevin Ross  Jacob sat on the bench for quite awhile. Eyes closed and the sun warming his bones. He thought about young Kevin's letter and the more he thought about it the better he felt. Maybe lighthouse keeping was not as exciting as it once was but if every once in awhile he could still save a life than it was as exciting as it needed to be.

						   Before my grandmother became tangled in the web of Alzheimer's there were various incidents that were either early signs of the disease or the normal changes that come with age. As with all seniors citizens there came a time when her driving skills began to erode and we as a family were left with deciding when the keys should be taken away.  We were luckier than a lot of the families who have been in the news over the last several years. We waited to long to take away the keys but fortunately God or fate was smiling on my grandmother because when the unavoidable happened no one was hurt.  One morning she got into her car intending to drive to her Senior Citizens club. Now her garage was attached to the house and the back wall of the garage faced the street. In order to leave her property she had to back out of the garage and loop around the house to reach the road.  She started the car as she normally would and allowed the engine to warm up. Her car had a manual transmission and when went to put in gear she missed reverse and put it into neutral. She depressed the accelerator and of course nothing happened. At that point she must have panicked because when she shifted gears again she put it into drive with the engine fully revved. She left skid marks on the floor of her garage and went right thru the wall.  In the front yard just outside the rear wall of the garage were three trees. Somehow she missed all of the trees and continued across the lawn. Separating the lawn from the sidewalk was a low brick and wrought iron wall. She went through that like a hot knife through warm butter and into the street.  The street she lived on was fairly busy but fortunately no one was coming in either direction. As she crossed the street she managed to regain some control over the car and turned the steering wheel hard to the right. She made a u-turn jumped the curb and flipped the car onto the passenger side door coming to rest right in the middle of her own driveway.  When the police arrived she was sitting on the passenger door calmly asking for someone to help her out of the car. She walked away without a scratch. The only casualty: her driver's license.

						   The body lay on the floor. Threatening even in death.  His living room resembled the aftermath of a 6.2 earthquake. All of the lamps had been knocked over, bulbs shattered leaving sparkling trails that followed the path of destruction. Photographs and paintings that had been knocked from the wall were scattered about the room. The stereo lay on its side while only a low hum could be heard from the speakers. Plants that had once stood on the windowsill embracing the sunlight were overturned with soil, roots and leaves ground into the carpet.   He sat in his rocking chair near the window. His face was red and his shirt was soaked thru with sweat. His chest was heaving as he fought to gain control over his breathing. He looked about the room surveying the damage and reliving the past fifteen minutes of his life.  After several weeks of stress filled overtime he was taking a day off to recharge his batteries. He had slept in, taken a leisurely walk and planned on spending the afternoon on the couch napping and listening to music. He had just begun to slip off into dreamland when there was a knock on the door.  Answering the knock he found someone from Fed-Ex with a package for him. Perfect timing he thought to himself as he signed for the envelope, he couldn't have knocked five minutes ago he had to wait until I was almost asleep. Thanking the driver he tossed the envelope on the table and lay back down.  As he attempted to find his way back into nap land he found himself tossing and turning on the couch he just could not find his comfort zone. In frustration he threw his pillow across the room. Thatâ€™s when he heard the sound, not very loud, but very clear. Nervously he looked around the room. There it was again. A trickle of fear ran down his spine. He was no longer alone. Somewhere in his house was an intruder.  Silently, he rose from the couch, removed the shovel from a set of fireplace tools and began his search. He stood quietly and was rewarded with that sound again, still not very loud but still clear.  He began his search in the kitchen. Everything was as it should be. He checked the downstairs bathroom. Nothing. He turned back into the living room and out of the corner of his eye he thought he detected movement. He swung the shovel and connected with nothing but a lamp that shattered on the floor. Spinning he swung again and swept a slew of family pictures off of the wall.  Calm down he thought to himself, keep your wits and you will survive, panic and who knows what the outcome will be.  He crept about the living room eyes darting to the corners looking for any movement. Again he thought he heard something behind him and in swinging the shovel he knocked over the stereo dislodging the cd he had been listening to. The sound was growing louder he could sense the intruder was near. Pretending indifference he neared the front window and let loose with a wild swing knocking all of his plants off the windowsill.   He twisted to his left and tripped over a footstool, knocking two more lamps over as he fell to the ground. He lay there on his back red in the face and fighting for air. He could hear the sound clearer now. Just over his shoulder and to his right. Gripping the shovel, he turned on to his stomach and swung with all his might. Smack! He connected killing his trespasser instantly.  He struggled to his feet and sat in his chair with sigh. Victory was his and a disaster was averted.  The body of the bee lay on the floor. Threatening even in death.  Especially to him, he had a deadly allergy to bee stings and no bee sting kit in the house.

						   He strode the sandy beach barefoot and lost in thought, oblivious to the sounds of the crashing surf and the beauty of the setting sun. Around him children built sand castles and young lovers whispered promises soon forgotten in the heat of a summer evening.  For him though there were just his footprints in the sand stretching out behind him. He walked with a purpose but without direction. His walking was an exercise of frustration. If his mind had been his own he would have spent today anywhere but here. Browsing the used bookstores in North Hollywood or watching the horses at Santa Anita the possibilities were endless and closed to him. His mind was not his own and fate had ensured that he would spend today of all days walking the sands of Laguna Beach.  One year ago today on this very beach she had walked out of his life never to be heard from again. Ahead of him he could see the cliffs where they had sat together on what he had assumed would be one of the happiest days of his life.   He had arrived before her spreading out a blanket for the two of them to share while they watched the sunset. Gourmet sandwiches had been prepared and placed in a picnic basked along with a bottle of cider since neither one of us drank. The surf was soothing and she was beautiful walking across the sand, shoes in her hand and blonde hair dancing in the summer breeze.  She had sat with him nibbling at her sandwich and sipping cider, for him the excitement had been too much and his appetite had fled. As the sun disappeared from the sky they huddled together and watched as a sky filled with diamonds appeared. Taking that as his cue he removed a ring from his pocket and asked her to be his forever.  She had taken his hand and with tear filled eyes she had whispered words that his ears were not ready to hear.   "I love you, but no I cannot marry you. If only life were that simple I would run off to Vegas with you tonight and if only words could explain my reasons I would save you from so much pain. Maybe someday you will understand. Until than hate me if you must but believe that my heart will always be yours."  He was stunned. He had been so sure of her answer that when she said no he had no response no words, no argument. He had stood up, dusted the sand from his clothes and walked away leaving her, the blanket, the food and the ring behind. That night he had driven up and down Pacific Coast Highway for hours. No music on the radio just him and his thoughts. Dawn brought him no closer to peace. So he went home and tried to move on. Sure he worked hard and hung out with the guys on the weekend, but she never wondered far from his thoughts. As much as he hated to admit it his heart and soul still belonged to her.  He came back to himself and found he was passing the cliff where they had sat last year. A few couples sat nearby in the sand and he silently wished them better luck than his. He reached the tide pools and climbed up on one of the rocks just in time to catch the end of the sunset. He closed his eyes and felt the damp ocean breeze caress his face but fail to ease the turmoil of his soul. With a sigh he lay back on the rock and watched as the night gave birth to sky filled with stars. He must have dozed off because the crashing surf foretelling the incoming tide jolted him awake.   He sensed her presence before she spoke.  "Do you mind if I sit down?"  He did not trust himself to speak so he indicated his consent with a nod. She was still just as beautiful and it tore at his soul to know that she was lost to him forever. His mind whirled in confusion why was she here, then looking down he saw his ring in her hand and he knew she was just returning his ring. His last shreds of hope crumbled and his eyes filled with silent tears.  She turned the ring over and over in her hand and quietly she began to speak. "I almost turned around and walked away when I saw you sitting on this rock. I did not know if I had the courage to face you. I couldn't though; I couldn't walk away again without at least speaking to you and explaining my actions. I loved you then and when tonight when I saw you sitting in the moonlight on that rock I knew I loved you still."  My heart leapt and I began to speak but she put a finger to my lips and asked me to allow her to finish.   "You have to realize we had only known each other two months and there was a lot you did not know about me. Just before we met I spent two months in rehab. I am an alcoholic and I had spent exactly two weeks clean and sober before you walked into my life. Over our time together I found it very easy to stay away from the bottle but that was with you. I needed to know if I could live a sober life on my own. No crutches, no excuses just me against Jack Daniels. I am sorry I had to be so harsh but it was the only way I could test myself. You are a good man and I know you would have attempted to convince me to stay. I couldn't. I had to know if the war was over or if it was just a temporary cease-fire. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s my big secret. I am now and will always be an alcoholic but for one year and two and a half months I have been a sober one. I know now I can stand on my own."  She held up my ring and the diamond sparkled in the moonlight. She looked at him with soft, tear filled eyes. "I loved you yesterday, I love you today and if you will have me I want to love you tomorrow and forever more."  I opened my arms and she stepped into them. Without a word I kissed her and placed my ring on her finger where it belonged. Arm in arm we walked back along the beach where a few hours before I had walked alone. My footprints had been washed away by the incoming tide but behind us in the glittering sand were the first footprints we had created in our new life together.

						   She was a mother of three before her twenty-sixth birthday. Before her twenty-eighth birthday she had sent her alcoholic husband packing and was supporting her children on her own.  She worked night's car hopping and waitressing. By day she changed diapers, dried tears and did her best to be the best mom and dad she could be. Before long she landed a job as a teller, which without much planning led to a banking career for her.  She was den mother and a little league booster. She sewed costumes. She taught phonics. Without much assistance she was able to purchase her own house.  She dated but if the man she was seeing had no interest in her children than he was soon sent packing. One night while at the lodge with her boyfriend she saw that a trip was coming up to Palm Springs. She asked him to take her and the kids, he said I will take you but we will leave the kids at home. The man sitting to her right spoke up and said he would love to take her and the kids. She said agreed and that how she met her one true love.  They married and they moved to a bigger house. She worked hard to make her new life work and it did. Her children grew and developed into responsible young adults. At the bank she found herself in management and began taking classes to facilitate her climb up the corporate ladder.  Just when the future seemed set in stone health problems developed. She developed breast cancer. After a mastectomy she went back to work and began chemo treatments. After six months the cancer was in remission and after five years she was cancer free. He had a heart attack.  The children moved out and life began to mellow. Now that it was just the two of them they began to travel. Cruises and cross-country drives. They had a pool and a Jacuzzi put in at the house so they could entertain all of their friends.  They began to look forward to retirement but before any firm plans could be considered he developed lung cancer and before she knew it she found herself a widow at forty-eight. She continued to work and move up through the bank. She spent time with her children and her grandchildren. She bought herself a place near Laughlin, Nevada on the Colorado river where she could go relax on the weekends.   As the corporate world changed she took early retirement, sold her house and moved to the river full time. Before she became too comfortable in her new life of leisure she had a major heart attack and a second mastectomy when the breast cancer returned.   Today her health is good and she spends her free time visiting her grandchildren and playing video poker. She is a wonderful person and I am proud to call her mom.

						   With the late spring rain Came the final scene Where the woman he loved Broke his heart It was a Tuesday In May At a little hotel In Santa Barbara Where the roar of the surf Couldn't cover the sound Of his breaking heart   Without an intro, she began There's another man she said They had been sharing a bed For the past year or two  And he felt like such a fool Watching her sit there, looking so cool While he fell apart, like a little boy Who had just lost his favorite toy  With tear filled eyes he asked her why With heart wrenching sobs he begged please don't lie He needed the truth, no matter how it hurt  She closed her eyes for quite awhile Before she whispered Once upon a time I loved you I would have sworn that love was true But as the years passed by I won't lie, that love faded away Than he came into my life He made everything seem all right He gave me his love, and he set my heart free I am sorry and I never meant to hurt you But now the time has come for me to leave With that, she turned her back And without a good by she was gone  He sat in quiet solitude His soul like a ship on a stormy sea Being tossed and turned By the waves her words produced He cried, he screamed, he considered suicide No not that he thought I want to live With her or without her I will survive A better person for loving her A stronger person for losing her Though no matter how I fight it I will love her Until the end of time

						   On at least three separate occasions in my life I have experienced something akin to a premonition. Now I am not claiming to have ESP or anything like that. However two of the three "premonitions" mentioned above did actually prove to have some validity to them. Instinctually I believe the third one was also accurate but since I cannot prove it I count it as a miss.  Premonition First: one afternoon during our junior year of high school my friend J. and I decided to take a drive. Like most sixteen year olds we wanted to test the boundaries of our newfound freedom.   Not to far from our high school was Santa Anita canyon. The road to the canyon was several miles of twists and turns, which ended at a parking lot with a spectacular view of the San Gabriel Valley. The canyon was popular with teenagers for three basic reasons, the thrill of the drive, partying and of course it was a perfect place to bring your girlfriend on a Friday night or any other night for that matter.  On this particular day I was driving and J. was just enjoying the scenery. About halfway up the mountain my entire being was suddenly in the clutches of the worst fear I had ever experienced. For no logical reason I knew I had to pull the car over as close to the edge of the road as possible and stop. Something like this had never happened to me before but I did not question the feeling. I pulled over till my right tires were almost kissing the clouds and stopped the car. My hands were shaking and J. was looking at me like I had lost my mind but my throat was so dry that I could not even explain what I was doing I just sat there.  My fear grew steadily until off in the distance we both heard the screeching of car tires. Not two hundred yards away from where we were stopped a speeding car came around the corner in our lane. If we had continued forward my car would have probably been pushed over a cliff and fell a thousand feet to the rocks below. The other car sped past us, missed the next turn and went over the edge.   I quickly turned my car around and headed back down the mountain for help. We found a pay phone and J. called the police. As it turns out that there were four guys in the car who had all been smoking pot and drinking. Three of the four survived the accident the one who didn't was not wearing is seatbelt and was thrown from the car smashing his skull on a boulder.  Premonition Second: another friend and another canyon. I was not driving my friend S. was. We had gone out to dinner and since his car was new he wanted to see how it handled on some mountain roads. So we drove up into Azusa canyon, which was not far from where we lived. It was a beautiful night, the windows were down the stereo was blasting and all was right with the world. Suddenly for no reason at all there was a cold shiver running up and down my spine. My mind was filled once again with stark terror. I managed to yell at S. to stop the car. He did and looked at me like I was nuts. In a shaky voice I explained to him that I knew if we drove much further up the mountain something horrible would happen.   At first he laughed at me because he thought I was pulling his leg. Than he saw the look in my eyes and realized I was serious. I told him I know it sounds crazy and you don't have to believe me but just turn around for me. It took a few minutes but S. finally listened to me and headed back down the mountain.  Nothing happened and S. would kid me about it every once in a while but somewhere deep inside there is a part of me that still believes if we had continued up that mountain something would have gone wrong.  Premonition Third: in 1982 my girlfriend at the time and I were moving into a new apartment. I had taken the day off from work to move our stuff. Our new place was about a block from Foothill Blvd., which is a very busy street especially during rush hour.  Two of my friends had come over to help move the heavy stuff and after a long day we were sitting around the table shooting the breeze. Again for no explainable reason I knew something was wrong. Without a word I jumped up from the table and ran for the door. A chorus of what's wrongs followed me and as I hit the landing I shouted over my shoulder that L.(my girlfriend) was going to be in an accident. As I ran down the stairs I heard my somewhat confused friends following me and in the distance the unmistakable sound of a metal on metal collision.  When I reached the corner I found my girlfriends car with the passenger side door caved in. She had been attempting a left hand turn and never saw the car that hit her. Fortunately both her and the other driver were banged up but otherwise they were fine.   So there you have it my three experiences with premonitions. I must have only been allotted a trio of premonitions because I have not had one for over twenty years.

						   Everyone has one, from your neighbor to your mother; everyone has his or her very own restaurant horror story. Most of us have more than one.   Several years ago a group of us were dining out at one of the chain restaurants. We had all eaten at this particular location before and never encountered a single problem. So our expectations were that we would be sharing an enjoyable evening amongst friends.  Right from the start clouds of doom began forming on our dining horizon. What was presented to us, as a twenty-five minute wait somehow became a seventy-five minute wait. No problem we thought, its Friday night these things happen. We were in the bar having a few cocktails before dinner so we accepted the delay without complaint.  We were finally seated after close to a ninety-minute wait, which in reality is not bad for Los Angeles on a Friday night.  Our next sign of impending doom appeared when we arrived at our table. Though someone had apparently attempted to bus the table there were still a few soiled napkins and used silverware scattered about. The table was filthy and the previous diners either had a child with them or they had been raised by wolves because the floor beneath the table held the scattered remain of at least one meal.  Without batting an eye our hostess, with a straight face, told us to take a seat and she would send someone over to finish cleaning the table. This is the point where we should have headed to the nearest In & Out for Double-Doubles and fries but no we must have been feeling rather masochistic that evening so we stayed for the floorshow. A busboy finally showed up, wiped down the table and brought us utensils and water. He even remembered to bring a sweeper to clean the buffet out from under the table.  We perused the menus, made our choices and looked about us expecting that some member of the wait staff would swoop down on our table pad in hand ready to take our orders. Of course that was entirely too ask. There was not even a restaurant employee within shouting distance of our table. Finally, just about the time we had begun to second-guess our asking the busboy to remove the floor level buffet our server arrived.  Talk about a waitress with a chip on her shoulder this woman was hauling one of the Giant Sequoias around behind her. Surly, snotty, snobbish I mean if you had seen her on the street you would have crossed to the other side just to avoid her. By this point in time we were really not concerned with whom our server was we just wanted to eat.   It was a simple order really. Everyone ordered ribs and baked potatoes easy to prepare easy to deliver right. Wrong. When she finally returned with our food instead of six orders of ribs there were three. Instead of the other three ribs we had received grilled chicken breasts. We attempted to explain to our lovely server what our actual order was but having to think seemed to confuse her so we finally asked for a manager to come to the table. He corrected the problem and replaced the chicken plates with rib plates.  It was not until we began eating that we discovered that all of our potatoes were undercooked and two of them were not cooked at all. We did not even bother to mention this latest development to the restaurants obvious choice for employee of the month as she was busy whispering sweet nothings to one of the busboys. Not once during the meal did miss sunshine surprise us with a visit to ask if we needed anything else.  Finally we managed to gnaw our way through the last of the rib bones and we decided it was time to head for home. The atmosphere was just too heady for our taste. We were finally able to get the personality queens attention and managed to convey our need for a check so we could leave.   Once we divided the tab a small debate ensued, to tip or not to tip, that was the question. Most of the table was on the anti-tipping side. Two were for leaving a moderate tip as they felt that it was proper to leave something. My vote was for leaving a dollar tip. I felt that leaving no tip was too obvious and leaving a moderate tip was undeserved. My point was a one-dollar tip for a seventy-five dollar tab was just subtle enough to be insulting. I was able to sway my fellow diners with my convoluted logic and we left one dollar.  Now for the punch line: as we headed for the parking lot we heard someone shouting for us to wait. We stopped figuring maybe one of us had left something behind. Turning we saw our waitress running toward us waving our one dollar tip. Upon reaching us she started ranting about how it was customary to leave at least a fifteen percent tip and that one-dollar did not cut it for a seventy-five dollar tab. I in turn informed her that it was customary to provide service worthy of a fifteen percent tip and since she hadn't she received the tip she deserved. At that point I reached out and removed our dollar from her hand and informed her that chasing a customer out to the parking lot was such a classless act that she no longer deserved even that tip.   With that we turned and walked away leaving one stunned waitress in the parking lot.

						   Friday nights my siblings and I would stay at our Grandmothers. Sometimes until one or two in the morning when my mom and step-dad would return from their night on the town. My brother and sister were always in bed by nine but by virtual of being the oldest I was allowed to stay up until eleven or eleven thirty.   I can still smell the sheets of the bed I would sleep in. Nana had a washing machine but she never would use her dryer. Her sheets were always hung on the clothesline to dry. The scents they absorbed were nothing like the artificial scents of today. Oranges, lemons, tangerines, fresh cut grass all of natures ingredients would mix into wonderful new perfumes that became with the linens I slept on.  Nana was a nurse and always worked the graveyard shift. On Friday nights she would tuck me and listen to my prayers while she was fixing her hair and preparing to leave for work. If I close my eyes I can still see her wearing one of those starchy all white uniforms of old and a matching nurses hat clipped to her hair with several bobby pins.  Once my prayers were finished she would sit on the end of my bed and share a few stories with me. Most children my age would be tucked into bed with tales of knights and dragons, princesses and rogues while all the while my grandmother was sharing with me the latest news and gossip from the ward she worked on. Nana worked at the City of Hope and she spent most of her career there on what she called "the terminal ward". In the late sixties and early seventies most cancer treatments were not very successful so her job was primarily to reduce the suffering of and provide comfort to those in the final stages of their battle. So her "stories" primarily consisted of which patients might not make it through the night, what families were handling things well and which ones weren't.  So as my peers floated off to dreamland on white feathery clouds, riding mighty steeds and saving the fair damsel in distress. While my dreams were dominated by the angel of death and visions of souls taken to soon wandering the wards unable to accept the fact that their time on earth was through.  Now that I think about it I would not have had it any other way.

						   Yesterday, wisps of fog could be found swirling amongst the ancient oaks, ghosts from another time. Today the oaks are without chaperones. Lonely sentinels left to guard the memories of those who are no longer gravities prisoners. The ground beneath their limbs is bare but for granite stones, cold and impersonal, scattered upon the earth. A sober acceptance of the passing seasons entwined with the denial of times never ending march. Visitors are few to these somber acres. Hidden from view behind rusted, wrought iron fences fighting a losing battle with the encroaching vines. The few who still make the journey are barely discernible from those who have already moved beyond this realm. Old beyond their years they still fight for the memory of those who have passed before them. Feeble attempts are made to clear the weeds from around the stone that marks the passing of one they loved. Silent prayers are shared as tears from still grieving eyes soak through the earth to the bones below. Each visit made is a solemn reminder that soon there will be not one but two names etched in stone.  From the top of the old hill where teenagers still park a mournful fog once again winds its way through the stones. In the silent darkness the living will drink their beer and dare each other to slip through the fence and touch one of the stones. While in the fog bound darkness yesterday's lovers, rise from the dust and dance to the rhythm of the stars.

						   She stood at the cities border her back to all she had ever known or loved. Before her lay a journey of unspeakable hardship and pain, a journey that would either break her or like Moses before her she would emerge from the harsh desert cleansed by God's furnace.  She thought about the life she was leaving behind. A small flat, where on warm nights her parents would often find her stretched out on a blanket. A smile on her face as she lost herself in the wonders of the universe and the many gifts of God's creation.   Her parents were gone now. No ones fault. She found herself avoiding the roof. In her eyes the universe held no more wonders. A god who could randomly remove her parents from her life was not a god she chose to believe in. After the funeral she boxed all of the holy books and religious artifacts and placed them in the back of the storeroom.  Many months passed but for her time had stopped. Books lay scattered about her room unread. Knocks on the door went unanswered. When she did leave the flat it was for the bare necessities: bread, fruit, canned goods and tea.   Old friends and new attempted to pass through the doorway into her inner sanctum but they were turned away one and all. Without realizing it she had begun to confuse independence with pride. Even the most independent of souls needs to lean on someone sometime. However, her pride would not allow her to see her need for friends as a virtue but clung to the belief that to lean on someone was to show weakness.  So now she stood with her back to the city she once loved and began a journey into desolation in search of salvation.   Her plan was simple her against the scorching sands of the desert. The heat and sandstorms would either kill her or heal her. On her back she carried to water skins, dates and hard bread. She had a rough map that purported to show the locations of several oasis's but who knew anything of its accuracy.  She set out at dusk figuring she could walk further with less water if she traveled by night and slept by day. Before long the walls of her small city were lost to the horizon and she found herself truly alone for the first time. For miles in every direction was empty desert, behind her barely visible in the darkness were her footprints. Glistening in the moonlight from the many tears that escaped as she roamed the desolate wilderness. Before her lay empty sand smooth and flat awaiting her footsteps.  By the third day she began to lose track of how many days she had been walking. The calendar of her old world lost its importance as she began to rely on the sun and moon as her timepieces.  Every other day or so she would stumble across a small oasis, little more than a mud hole with a few date palms taking advantage of what moisture there was. Here she would wash the desert sand from her feet and allow herself a few extra hours of rest before continuing her journey.  No matter how far she traveled she found she still had tears to cry. She cried for her parents, for forgotten friends and for lost opportunities. She found herself crying in her sleep for worlds she had never known and beings she had never seen.  Finally there came a day where she could cry no more. The bitterness, the sadness, the anger, the envy all of it had been washed from her soul.  Just before sunrise she came across a true oasis. Beautiful trees, a large pool of fresh water everything a weary traveler could want. She dropped her pack and jumped in the water soaking the grime from her skin and the last bits of darkness from her soul.  When she emerged she lie down in the tall grass and fell asleep.   She awoke to the sound of goats rustling in the grass and drinking from the pool. Nearby sitting on a large flat rock sat an old man. He had a small fire going. He looked up and spotted her.   "Come join me young one," his lips barely moved when he spoke but his voice was crisp and clear.  He began asking her questions about her travels where she had been and where she planned to go. He told her things about herself that she did not even know. His gentle eyes looked into her heart and soul and her spirit was naked before him.  He began to softly speak: "Young one you have learned and accomplished much on your journey. In the beginning you looked deep into yourself and found yourself wanting. So you set out on your own to find what was missing. You traveled across a desert that strikes fear in grown men and yet you survived. Along the way you discarded that which was needed no more: anger, selfishness, bitterness, sorrow, aloofness and stubbornness. Each tear you cried washed these traits from your soul. However my daughter you made this journey harder on yourself than necessary. Your friends and family would have held you as you cried and your tears washed these traits from your soul. Look back my daughter look at the footprints you have left behind. Each tear has brought to life a solitary rose. Roses are beautiful alone but in a bouquet their beauty knows no boundaries. You belong in a bouquet of friends and family my daughter each rose is important to the bouquet and now it is time for you to rejoin your bouquet."  She sat in silence for many hours pondering the words of the goat herder. She drifted off into a dreamless sleep. She awoke feeling refreshed, she stretched andâ€¦..  Opened her eyes finding herself not in the desert but in her own bed. On her bedside table was a bouquet of the most exquisite roses she had ever seen. She slowly sat up and looked around her something was different. What she wasn't sure but something. She stood up from her bed just as the door to her room openedâ€¦.  without thinking she flew into the arms of her parents crying tears of joy.

						   I cannot remember his name. I cannot remember the way he looked or how he spoke. I cannot remember where he lived or what he did for a living. What I can remember and what I will never forget is the affect he had on my young life and the gift that he gave to me a perfect stranger.  His appearance in my life was brief a few weekends over a two-year period. I was ten years old and a member of the local Boy Scout Troop.   I was not the most outgoing scout but I enjoyed the various events especially working toward earning my merit badges. I made several new friends and I was looking forward to the first overnight trip when someone hit the emergency brakes and brought my scouting dreams to jarring stop.  It seems that at the time the rule was that each boy must be accompanied by his father on any overnight outings. Which left me out in the cold. My parents were divorced and my father was an irresponsible alcoholic who could not be counted upon to participate in any parental activities. None of my uncles lived near by and there were no family friends of the male persuasion available.   I was fortunate enough to have a Scout Master who understood my situation and who went the extra mile to ensure my ability to participate in overnight activities. He was unavailable for the role of weekend father because his sons were already members of the troop. However he did get on the phone and explain my predicament to a friend of his who volunteered his services.  Nervous does not begin to describe how I felt on the weekend of my first ever-camping trip. In 1969 being in a single parent family was still rather rare and I was not sure how I would handle a weekend where all of my friends were with their dad's and I was with a stranger who had volunteered to be my temporary dad. Would we get along? Would he even like me? Thousands of thoughts chased each other around my head while I waited for the big event.  Saturday morning arrived and found me waiting in front of my house with my pack and sleeping bag. I was going to ride with my Scout Leader and his friend. They finally arrived and introductions were made. It was not as bad as I imagined. He was just a guy and he appeared to be as nervous as I was. He broke the ice by offering everyone a sample of venison jerky that he had made himself after a recent deer-hunting trip. While I was not interested in the hunting part I did listen intently when he described the backpacking and the wilderness skills that he had.  By the time we arrived at the campground we were becoming old friends. We chatted a bit and he taught me how to build our tent. Most of the day was spent in-group activities and my focus drifted from being without my "dad" to just participating. Time passed and before I knew it the sun was setting and all the scouts drifted towards their fathers for some quiet time before dinner.  I found my way back to the tent where my "temporary dad" was waiting. I sat next to him and watched the bonding taking place all around the campground. My thoughts must have traveled pretty far because the next thing I remember was "dad" placing a hand on my shoulder and asking me if I wanted to go for a walk. I shrugged my shoulder, got up and followed him out of camp.  Eventually we came to a small lake and sat quietly for a while skipping stones across the water.  Finally he looked at me, smiled and told me a story.  He said that not to many years ago he had found himself in a similar situation. He was a scout and his father was no longer around. He did not go into a lot of detail but what it all boiled down to is that someone had volunteered to be his "dad" for a few weekend trips and it had made an impression on him. While it was never the same as being with his real dad in some ways it was better because his "temporary dad" wanted to be there and he made the trips special in his own way. He said that he had made a promise to himself that the best way to pay back his "temporary dad" was to do the same for someone else if and when the opportunity presented itself.  He told me that this was his opportunity and the only goal he had was to make sure I had the best of all possible weekends.  I sat quietly digesting what he had told me. Finally I gave him a tentative smile and thanked him for coming along. Just than we heard the dinner call and he gave my head a quick rub pulled me to my feet and shouted; "Last one back in camp is a rotten egg!"  That and the other weekends we spent together were memorable in their ordinariness. It was as if we had formed our own little family of boys/men without dads. We hiked and ran and swam and told ghost stories under the stars. When the trips ended we went our separate ways.  Once my scouting days were over we drifted apart and lost track of each other.  As an adult I would have liked the opportunity to personally thank him for all he did for me. Since that is not possible, I mean how can I find him if I cannot even remember his name, so I thank him by attempting to pass on the lessons he taught me. I offer a shoulder where I see one is needed. An ear where I see a child who just needs someone to listen. Or a good "last one to the pool is a rotten egg" when all that is needed is someone to remind them that life is really all about having fun. Especially when you are ten.

						   July 1980 found me in love or at least I believed I was.  We had met the previous Thanksgiving over a game of Spoons. I had been sitting comfortably at home lingering over a slice of one of my mothers perfectly baked Pumpkin Pies when the phone rang. My presence was requested for a night of cards with several friends. Reluctantly I pushed myself away from the table and set off on a remarkable journey.  I was the last one to arrive and before I could say hello I found myself in the last remaining chair waiting for the cards to be dealt. Looking up I was immediately captured by a pair of the most beautiful eyes I had ever seen, I am pretty sure that there was a face that went with them but I could not get past the eyes. They glowed with a warmth that was almost physical and when their owner laughed they shined brighter than a harvest moon.  We were finally introduced and much to my dismay it turned out that she was only visiting for the Thanksgiving weekend and would be returning home on Sunday. Cards were played, hands were dealt, and people won and people lost but the only memory I have of the evening was meeting her.  She was staying with my best friend so I was able to spend most of the weekend with her. Sunday came before I knew it and as we said our goodbyes we promised to write.  Our paths next crossed most disastrously over the New Years holiday. She came back for a visit hoping to see me again. A group of us were planning to spend New Year's Eve on the Rose Parade route. All signs pointed to a fantastic night when without warning all of the omens went south.  Apparently she was not the only one who had planned to spend New Years with yours truly. Two other girls that I had dated off and on over the past year were there. So what did I do? Did I follow my heart and spend the evening by her side? Of course not, I did what every twenty-one year old male would do. I let ego and hormones take over and ended up falling for someone whom I had just met and I ignored everyone else including her.  Fortunately she was much more mature than I was and over the next few months we spoke over the phone and through many letters and she did eventually forgive me.   As spring waned and summer appeared on the horizon I flew to her hometown to visit her and her family. She gave me the nickel tour and we talked through the night. We discussed love and marriage and again her maturity saved me from my lack of, she explained that while we did love each other it was much to soon to talk about a permanent relationship.  Summer arrived and she came back to California for a visit. My grandmother offered her spare bedroom, which allowed for a longer visit.  We spent a lot of time at the beach. We went to the Long Beach Arena and saw the Eagles in concert, which as it turned out was their last before their first breakup.  We grew closer and spent many hours talking about our dreams and our futures. While I was already working she had just graduated from high school and was narrowing her choice of colleges. Life was beautiful.  The 4th of July found us roaming the streets of Disneyland with thousands of other celebrants. Haunted Houses were explored and the Caribbean was sailed once again. We chased each other around Tom Sawyers Island until we collapsed from laughing so hard.  Nine o'clock found us sitting above the entrance of Space Mountain waiting for the fireworks to begin. A band was playing a cover of "If" by Bread. As we listened to the lyrics our mood became less playful and a bit more serious.  She looked at me and I could feel her eyes capture my soul. She whispered that there was no "If" about it that she had everything she had ever wanted right here and she gently kissed my lips just as the fireworks filled the sky.  Unfortunately most fairy tales in there original telling did not have a happy ending neither does this one.  At the end of the summer she chose to move to Los Angeles so she could attend USC. She said that one of the deciding factors for her was the proximity of the campus to me.  Before school started she came out for new student orientation and once her obligations were completed we had a chance to talk. Or should I say she talked and I failed to listen.  She explained that being eighteen and on her own for the first time that she needed some space. Not because she did not love me. Not because she had a burning desire to date someone else. It was lust because she wanted to enjoy campus and dorm life a bit without having to worry about relationship maintenance.  Of course being the clod in the relationship I translated everything she said into she no longer loves me. So as college life began for her I allowed us to drift apart. I no longer called and I no longer wrote. In my self satisfied way I assumed it was what she wanted and I never looked back.  Until..  After quite a bit of water had passed beneath the proverbial bridge we somehow ended up at Dodger stadium together. We watched the game and as corny as it sounds it was just like old times.   Of course old times are old for a reason because you can never go back only forward. The end of the game found us standing outside of her car saying goodnight. She smiled and her eyes were just as beautiful as they were on the day we met.  Before climbing into her car she looked at me and said I chose USC to be close to you. If you had just been a little bit more patient both of our futures might have been different. A quick hug and kiss on the cheek later she climbed into her car and drove out of my life for good.  If  Written by: David Gates and Bread  If a picture paints a thousand words Then why can't I paint you? The words will never show The you I've come to know If a face could launch a thousand ships Then where am I to go? There's no one home but you You're all that's left me to And when my love for life is running dry You come and pour yourself on me  If a man could be two places at one time I'd be with you Tomorrow and today Beside you all the way If the world should stop revolving Spinning slowly down to die I'd spend the end with you And when the world was through Then one by one the stars would all go out Then you and I would simply fly away

						    Note: Islands part one was posted on March 11, 2004   So out of necessity he became an observer. On his visits to neighboring islands he began to note the customs and the communication style that each practiced. He was fascinated by his new project and many months passed as hours were spent in laborious note taking. Each evening when he returned home he would transcribe what he had learned into books one volume for each of his island neighbors.  His findings surprised him.  The fault lay not with the other islanders but with him.    When the need arose and he offered help to the other islands, he was welcomed with open arms and put right to work. Usually a feast would ensue once the repairs were complete and everyone would have a great time.  When his island was damaged and help was offered he had never just said yes and welcomed the volunteers with open arms. Rather than accept aide in the spirit in which it was offered he required his neighbors to follow script of his own creation.  "We have our tools and we are ready to help complete the necessary repairs."  His usual reply would be something like, "You no guys the damage is really not that bad, and I can probably handle this myself."  "Hey its' no problem all of us neighbors have to stick together. The more hands at work the quicker the job will be completed."  "I know you all mean well, but I feel bad taking you away from your own islands and your own chores. I am sure I am not the only one that needs help."   "Come on buddy, you have provided assistance to each and every one of us. We are your friends and all we want is for you to allow us to offer a little help. What is the major obstacle here?"  Reading his notes he began to realize how blind he had truly been. He was not friendless the waters around his island were filled with those who wanted to be his friend.   It was he who had issues. It was he who did not understand the meaning of unconditional friendship. Heartfelt offers of aide were made and he spent hours rationalizing until he drove his friends away.  His help was still accepted. His friendship was still embraced. However even the most loving of people will eventually tire of banging their head against the proverbial wall and he had been that wall to his friends.  Here he was all proud of myself for how well he took care of others. Always on the run, always being the first to arrive and the last to leave. He thought his island was perfect.  However, as it turns out he suffered from faults just like everyone else. His fault was having too much pride. His fault lay in his inability to accept honest offers of assistance in the context in which they were given. There is a fine line between selflessness and selfishness and he had made a giant leap over that line. In driving his fellow islanders away he had proven himself to be pride filled and selfish. To pride filled to allow others past his inner walls and to selfish to allow others the same opportunity for good deeds that they had allowed him.  That night as he lay beneath the summer stars he vowed that tomorrow would be different. He knew now that friendship was a two way street and that he had to allow others the same opportunity to give that they had allowed him.  As the moon rose he drifted off into a dreamless sleep with a childlike smile dancing on his lips.

						   Will we ever run out of reasons to justify the killing of our brothers and sisters?  Will we ever see past the boundaries of religion and come to understand that God loves each and every one of us regardless of the building in which we choose to worship?  Will we ever accept responsibility for our individual choices and not blame everything from the government to fast food resteraunts for our problems?  Will we ever come to understand that the best investment for the future of mankind is investing in the education and development of children worldwide?  Will we ever unite as citizens of this world and inform our leaders that we are no longer going to accept war and violence as solutions to international problems?  Will we ever begin to accept that we are responsible for the health of our planet or is it already to late?  Will we ever slow down the technological merry-go-round and consider the consequences of each new discovery before embracing it?  Will we ever realize that we are wasting one of the planets greatest natural resources by ignoring the wisdom of the elderly?  Will we ever embrace those who are less fortunate than ourselves rather than speed past them as if anything could be more important than seeing to the comfort of those who go without?  Will we ever turn off the so-called "reality" shows and step back into the reality of life?  Will we ever cast off the bindings of hatred that have held the human race in bondage for generations and return to the warmth of compassion?

						   She stood at the foot of disaster. Dancing with the devil until her soul ached from the strain of resistance. Her arms were bruised from the doublewide track of needle marks which served has her red badge of courage. The tattered bag clutched between her skeleton like fingers protected the tattered pages of her faith. A bible on whose pages she had made and broken many midnight promises to walk away from her life as a junkie. However the song of liquid fire was not easy to ignore and for every day clean there were months best forgotten.  Home was the ground between two shopping carts, which served has support for her cardboard roof. Old newspapers replaced the blankets she had grown up with; her pillow was the concrete of her bed.   Sleep did not come easy especially when she did not know where her next fix would come from. Distraction from her addiction came in the form of ghost's remnants of her former life.  Once upon a time she had been living a happy middle class life a living breathing clichÃ©. A house in the suburbs, a mini-van and a Honda Prelude, two kids, a dog and a cat. She had married her high school sweetheart who had become a high priced lawyer before her eyes. Her life was everything she had always thought she wanted except for the profound emptiness.  Until one evening at a fancy cocktail party one of the other wives had offered her a needle with the promise that the contents of the syringe would fill the void that had once been filled by a dream.  Without preamble she found herself addicted. Her husband put her in rehab where she temporarily kicked the habit. She stayed clean for a month but fell off the wagon when she stumbled across some drugs that her husband had missed. One more time through the rehab ringer found her back on the street trying to score even before her release papers were dry.  Her husband had found her curled up in a fetal position oblivious to the world on a street corner downtown. He did not send her to rehab again instead he served her with divorce papers. From there the downward spiral spun out of control. Nothing mattered but the next high, not her old life, not her kids, nothing but the feeling of sweet release.  Barely a year later she had one foot in the grave and with a certainty she had rarely known she knew that the other foot would soon follow if she did not find the strength to fight. The strength she had left was fragile. For several months now she had fought with everything she had to hold onto a small shred of her dignity. Unlike most of the other alley residents she had refused to use her body to get by. She suffered through withdrawals until she managed to collect enough cans and bottles to satisfy her cravings the old fashioned way with cash.  Today found her in a dank dark alley patiently waiting in line with other junkies as the dealer moved down the line collecting money and injecting his customers. She held out her arm and sighed with sweet relief as the warmth coursed through her veins. She stumbled through the alley in search of some privacy where she could enjoy her dance with the devil.  Dawn found her barely clinging to life on the steps of an abandoned building propped up against one of the doors. Through blurry eyes she saw a rainbow and found comfort in its simple beauty. Freedom came to her at last as her body gave up the fight and her spirit soared toward the morning sun.  A sign on the door above her final resting place read: "Rainbow Connection Drug Rehab Center has been closed due to a lack of funding."

						   The first automobile accident that I participated in happened on the 4th of July in 1967. My mom was driving us home from a fireworks show in our old red and black Rambler Station Wagon. The man behind her was spending too much time watching the fireworks and not enough time watching the road. No one was injured and the Rambler survived with a few dents and scratches. His insurance company was so relieved to find that my mother was not asking for more than the cost of repairing the car that they paid for our family to visit Disneyland.  Accident number two occurred several years later. After work my mother had picked us up from our grandmothers. On the way home she noticed that in the distance a car was veering into our lane. She slowed down and guided her car (a Cadillac) towards the side of the road. The oncoming car veered farther into our land and my mother continued to slow down and moved all the way on to the dirt shoulder. All her maneuvering was to no avail the car still hit us almost head on. By this time both cars were going rather slow and fortunately once again no one was hurt. The one humorous aspect of the event happened when my stepfather came to pick us up. While checking on the car a police office approached him and proceeded to explain that his "daughter" (my mom, his wife) was going to be just fine.  My first accident as a driver occurred when I was returning home after completing a twelve-hour shift at the restaurant I was working at. I was exhausted. Besides the work schedule the previous day I had just returned from a three-day camping trip in which I had very little sleep. All I remember is turning onto Norumbega which was just blocks from our house. Elton John was on the radio and before I knew it I was fast asleep. I was rudely awoken by my '63 Valiant plowing head on into a parked car, my car was totaled and the other car was damaged but salvageable. I was not hurt just a few bumps and bruises both to my body and my ego.  My next accident as a drive happened on the way to work at one of the worst freeway interchanges in the country. To merge onto the 10 east you must as a driver deal with commuters merging on to the 605 south from the 10 west. There is on average an accident a day at this interchange. In my case I was on my way to work and was part of a five-car pileup that occurred when the first driver stopped short. No one was hurt and my new/old '63 Valiant was the only car to drive away from the wreck.  The next accident I was involved in happened while my best friend was driving. We were just blocks from his house and for some reason when we came to the last intersection he kept going even though the light was red. We made it passed the south bound traffic without incident and we would have been fine if we had remained at the center divider but he kept going and we were broad sided by a north bound car. We spun completely round and the car came to rest against a telephone pole. The impact occurred on the passenger side of the car caving in the door and badly bruising my ribs. Fortunately that was the only injury I suffered.  The last accident I was in occurred in October of 1988. It was the day after the Dodger's won their last world series. I was merging onto the freeway on my way to work. The Eagles were playing on the radio and all was right with the world. Unfortunately disaster was just a few hundred yards ahead. The other driver was having mechanical difficulties and as his forward movement was coming to an end he tried to cut completely across rush hour traffic. He almost made it. I hit him going about fifty miles and hour. My pick up truck spun completely around and ended up two lanes over but facing in the same direction I had been heading. I banged up my knee and developed a touch of whiplash but as in all of the car accidents I have been a part of nothing important was hurt. My truck however was totaled.  It has been sixteen years and counting since that last accident, knock on wood, hopefully that was my last.

						   He had known plenty of fathers in his life's time. Any Tom, Dick or Harry could be a father. No education or testing required. No certificate or license. No application to complete and no interview to pass. No special requirements at all. Just puberty and a willing partner can make any man a father.  Yes he had known plenty of fathers. They came home from the office exhausted from their hard days work. They could be found feet up on the couch, beer in the hand and game on the tube. On weekends they were out on the golf course or down at the lodge playing cards with their drinking pals.   Others had divorced their wives or never married them in the first place. Some managed to pay child support and/or come around for a visit once in awhile but the majority made a brief effort than faded away like the morning's fog.  He had known plenty of father's but very few dad's including his own.  A dad.  From the beginning a dad was a different breed of animal. They can be found in the nursery after the birth of their child eyes filled with tears and wide with amazement. In the home they are changing diapers patiently pacing the floor at night with a crying baby.  As the child grows they can be found sitting cross-legged with their princess/daughter enjoying a tea party or walking hand in hand through the woods as she points out each and ever butterfly and asks for the name of each and every plant, tree or animal.   With their sons they can be found creating imaginary battlefields with plastic soldiers only to knock them all down in order to recreate the battle once again. Or spending hours with Lego's until a world has been created on the floor of the bedroom.  In the evening a dad can be found reading bedtime stories complete with different voices and roars depending on the setting. He can be found on his knees beside the bed of his children reciting prayers and discussing the tears of Angels.  On weekends he is the one with not only his kids but several other kids from the neighborhood gathered round him demanding airplane rides. He can be found rolling on the ground wrestling a mob by himself and escaping by using the dreaded tickle maneuver, which leaves his opponents in stitches. He plays catch and Frisbee. He plays hide and go seek and tag.   He is usually the dad who takes the dad less children in the neighborhood under his wing. Answering their questions and attempting to fill a small part of a large void left behind by a invisible man.  Any man can be a father but it takes a special kind of man to be a dad.

						   My childhood haunts were bordered by two former convalescent hospitals. One was located about a Â½ mile away and situated at the top of a hill. It was featured prominently in a previous post-entitled "Summer Scare."  The other hospital was located about two blocks away, down the street and across an old bridge. However having begun life as a convalescent hospital its twilight years were spent as a drug rehab center before closing due to pressure from local residents who were not happy with the proximity of the facility to their children who were still in there formative years.  Once abandoned the grounds became another set for our summer adventures.  Most of our parents would have displayed more intense displeasure at our choice of locations for long summer games of hide and go seek and ditch. However the over abundance of avocado trees and the begs of green heaven we brought home convinced them to look the other way as long as no one was hurt.  The hospital/clinic differed from the other one in that most if not all of the buildings were of the single story variety. In addition no equipment was left behind except for a few bed frames that were beyond salvage.  Most of our games included hiding as part of the process so all of us soon became familiar with the layout of the various buildings.  One afternoon found me as the designated "it" person who's job it was to search out the other hiders. As I roamed the buildings in search of my fellow hiders I came across a room I had not previously visited. Upon entering I was frozen in place by a vision my young mind could not explain.  The room was empty but in my mind I saw four beds one on each wall. The beds seemed to be higher above the ground than what would be considered normal, maybe waist high on the average adult. Though I was sure that I was alone I could see that rather aged individuals currently occupied each bed. As my gaze traveled from person to person I found my lingering on the woman in the last bed. She appeared to be in her eighties and extremely frail. I was absolutely sure that I had never been in this building before but at the same time I was equally sure that I had know this woman.  My attempt to solve the meaning of this perplexing vision was interrupted by my brother calling my name and telling me I had to go home. I walked up the street playing the scene over and over in my mind trying to decipher the clues.  I found my mom weeding the front yard garden. I asked her if we had ever visited the convalescent hospital before moving to our current residence. To say the least I was surprised when she said that we had. My father's grandmother had been a patient there before she passed away. I was about three years old at the time and my parents had brought me there to visit her. She died within the week of our visit.  I explained to my mother what I had seen and I asked her to walk down the street with me. We returned to the grounds and I asked her if she could remember the building my great-grandmother had resided in. Without err she walked directly to the room in which I experienced my vision. Upon entering she turned to me with questioning eyes and I told her that this indeed was the room that I had just seen Grandma Finn and three other patients in the beds.  Somehow my mind was able to make the connection to the room and bring back a memory that to this day I have no actual recollection of.  The hospital is gone now replaced by a group of six figure homes. I have often been tempted, but have never followed through, to visit the current residents and find out whether anyone has had a vision of four seniors on their last legs propped up in old metal beds. Maybe tomorrow.

						   They say he lost his mind on the corner of Spring Street and Seventh Avenue. Dressed for success he stood on the corner waiting for the light to change. In one hand he clutched a custom made leather briefcase in the other a cell phone. To the world he presented a picture of stability and sanity.  The light changed but he appeared not to notice and he never moved. The crowd parted around him an island of silence in a bustling sea of humanity. The five o'clock migration continued but he remained rooted to the sidewalk.  Thirty minutes passed before he began to move. Without much grace he set his briefcase on the sidewalk and sat on it. He carefully removed his loafers and his socks. He stuffed one sock into each shoe and without blinking threw his shoes out into the traffic where they were flattened by bus 994 on its way to the suburbs.   Next he placed his briefcase on his lap and sat cross-legged on the filthy sidewalk. He opened the case, removed a stack of forms and/or correspondence and began folding them into paper airplanes, which he tossed into the smog filled downtown air. He continued to remove documents, shredding them by hand and tossing the scraps into the air creating a blizzard of confetti.   He took the remaining items from his briefcase and began handing them to panhandlers gathered on the corner. Pens, pencils, wallet, credit cards, blank checks, his driver's license and even a picture of his four-year-old daughter all found their way into the hands of the homeless. Once it was empty he even handed over the briefcase.  While checking his pockets he came up with a handful of change, which he carelessly tossed onto the sidewalk creating a mini stampede. People knocked each other over while scrambling for the copper and silver glittering in the afternoon sun. His cell phone he gave to a veteran sitting in a wheelchair who was missing both of his legs.  While his personal drama had begun to unfold a crowd had gathered, whispering amongst themselves while they watched his nervous breakdown happen in real time.   With all of his possessions given away he proceeded to remove his clothing. Once he was naked he folded his suit and placed it on the top of a nearby post box. Oblivious to the catcalls and whistles he returned to the corner but rather than wait for the green light he stepped off the curb and wandered into the traffic. The squealing of brakes filled the air as the evening rush hour was brought to a grinding halt.   When he reached the center of the intersection he sat down and refused to move. Someone finally called the authorities. Communication was attempted but he would not speak. Finally an ambulance was requested and he was taken to the hospital.  With all of his identification gone identifying him became a daunting task. His fingerprints were not in the system and after seventy-two hours no one had filed a missing persons report. His picture was run in the local paper but to no avail. Various doctors spoke to him but he refused to even acknowledge them. He was given a full medical workup but the tests all came back negative giving him a clean bill of health. Several specialists examined him and to the best of their knowledge his brain appeared to be functioning normally.  After two months of attempting to identify him his trail had grown cold and he was declared a ward of the court. Since no family could be found he was institutionalized with the hope that someday he would awaken from whatever spell he was under.  On the one year anniversary of his breakdown a recap of his performance ran in the local paper. One local doctor was quoted as saying, "We know so little about the brain and how it functions that we are still baffled by cases such as this. The amazing thing though is not what happened to him but that it does not happen more often."

						   It was not that he did not dream, it was that he rarely if ever remembered his dreams. Some mornings he would waken with the script from the nights drama on the tip of his tongue, however the memory would always fade with the rising sun.  Which is what made this morning so remarkable. He had not only had a dream but he awoke with the memory intact.  This dream was like no other dream.  This dream had the power to change his life and the way he looked upon the world and for that matter all of God's creation.  This dream actually involved God herself.  Surprisingly, at least to him, the dream was neither solemn nor serious although it did manage to convey what could be labeled a truth.  In the dream he found himself walking down a deserted beach. The sun was a brilliant yellow and sky was so blue it hurt my eyes.  As he walked he listened to the song of the gulls as they soared upon the warm summer breeze. He watched as the waves rushed in to greet the sand.  He embraced a sense of peace that he rarely found in his waking world.  In the distance he became aware of another walker slowly making their way towards him.  As the figure drew closer he was forced to shade his eyes from the glow that seemed to surround the stranger.  However when they drew abreast he realized he had known her for an eternity. His soul cried out with joy for he was in the presence of God.  A thousand questions ran through his mind but he gave voice to none of them. He was speechless and for that matter thoughtless. He could not even form a sentence.  Before he could give voice to questions or confusions God spoke.  "I know what you are thinking and God's gender is not important. I chose to appear in your dream as I am but this is not my normal appearance."  "As to why I am visiting you in your dream my reasons are simple. Angels are not ticklish and I had the urge to tickle someone."  With that God reached out and tickled him until he was rolling in the sand laughing like there was no tomorrow. He laughed until tears were streaming down his face and he was gasping for air. Finally with a small sigh God stopped tickling him, smiled and headed off in the direction from which she had come.  She stopped for a moment, turned and spoke to him one last time.  "I am not really as solemn as most of humanity makes me out to be. I love to laugh, sing and dance. Besides there is nothing I enjoy more than a good tickle."  With that God faded into the distance and he awoke with his soul still smiling.

						   She sat at the foot of his be watching him sleep. She loved how his hair reflected the moonlight as if it were strands of finely spun gold. She found him to be a gentle sleeper, lying on his side with a pillow bunched up under his head.  In the darkness she found herself unafraid. As he slept she could whisper words that her lack of courage prevented her from saying aloud to his conscious self.  "I love you."  "I wish I could spend each and every night in your arms."  "I want to spend the rest of my life by your side."  The quiet of early morning allowed her soul to dance free and unfettered by expectations and promises.  Her heart could sing a thousand love songs without fear of rejection. Her mind could whisper Shakespeare's most romantic sonnets without care. Her one true love was asleep and would never know the dance steps her soul longed to teach him.  He was her roommate and her best friend.  They had shared the apartment for three years now and she understood him almost better than she understood herself. They had similar interests and they found themselves spending most of their time together: as friends.   They both dated but neither one of their relationships tended to last. Not that their bedrooms were built with revolving doors but they had both seen their share of traffic in the last over the years.  When her heart was broken he comforted her. When his heart was broken she took him out drinking because alcohol was the only way to loosen his tongue.   Both of them seemed to be searching for something more than weekend lovers. As of late she had come to realize that he might just be the one for her. She found him attractive and funny. They had so much in common that often times dawn would find them sitting up over coffee discussing philosophy, art or current events.  She found herself to be filled with mixed emotions. Should she risk their friendship and tell him how she felt? Or should she continue on her current path loving and losing until the scar tissue prevented her heart from loving again.  She had no answer. Her dreams were quicksand and she was trapped. She could not move forward but she did not want to move back.  So she whisperedâ€¦

						   In 1986 I was working for the real estate loan center of a large bank. I was the manager of the Records Department and I had a staff of fifteen full time employees and roughly thirty temps at anyone time.   One of my employees was somewhat of a special project who had come to work for me in 1982. His name was Bob and he came to work for me from a center that specialized in placing individuals with learning disabilities in the work force. One of their representatives presented their program to the bank and as it turned out I was the only manager willing to give Bob a chance.  He was thirty-six years old and he had never lived away from his parent's home nor had he ever had a real job. Bob was eager to learn and enthusiastic about his opportunity.  While training him was not easy the position did not exactly involve rocket science so eventually he was able to meet the minimum requirements for the job.  His social skills on the other hand were a different story entirely. Bob tended to invade the personal space of the person he was talking to, which of course made a lot of the employees uncomfortable. He would also ask every female he came into contact with out to lunch or to the movies. The answer was always no but he was never discouraged he just kept asking assuming that someone someday would say yes.  My employees tended to look upon Bob as a mascot and everyone tended to look out for him. Whenever possible they steered away from trouble and from the other managers who did not understand him. While Bob did have his problems he was always fun to be around. He was quick with a joke and he knew more about the movies than most Hollywood historians. He was a walking cinema encyclopedia.  Bob's birthday was in March and in 1986 he was going to celebrate his fortieth year. My employees and I got together to plan something special for him. Ideas journeyed around the table but most were impractical because our office was not in a central location and most of the staff had long commutes and were not interested in any kind of after hours get together. Someone mentioned having a potluck luncheon and jokingly added that we should get Bob a stripper for dessert. Everyone had a good laugh but somehow as the discussion progressed the stripper idea became a serious suggestion. Before I gave it much thought my phone was in my hand and I was calling my boss for approval.  What was I thinking? Much to my surprise my boss went for the stripper idea and even offered to contribute to the expense of the party. My boss at the time came across as being very conservative and his approval was very surprising.  The big day arrived and with everyone contributing we had a potluck of dishes from around the world. Bob was the center of attention and happier than I had ever seen him. We had kept the event low key because despite my bosses approval I did not thing senior management would have been happy about the day's entertainment.  The stripper was scheduled for two PM and as zero hour approached I was horrified to find a steady stream of visitors finding their way to the back of our storage room. Apparently word had spread through out the building and before I could protest the crowd was standing room only. To my surprise even senior management was represented by several of the buildings vice-presidents.  With all the mucky-mucks around I saw my career slowly swirling down a porcelain bowl. When the stripper arrived I could not bear to look and I kept to the back of the crowd. I wanted to have a clear get away if things went wrong.  The stripper provided her own music and without much fanfare began her performance. Everyone was clapping along with the music and having a good time. Bob was mesmerized and for a few moments he sat in stunned silence. Than much to my horror he stood up and began dancing with the girl. He followed her as she moved around the group.  Just when I thought things could not get worse they did. When the stripper removed her shirt Bob decided he would play along and so off came his shirt. I just about died. Any moment I expected to here her scream because Bob had grabbed her but my fears were misplaced. The girl knew what she was doing. She removed a t-shirt from her bag and placed it on Bob and than she lead him back to his chair. She explained that the show was for him but that she could only continue if he remained seated.  After that the rest of her presentation went smoothly. To my utter amazement none of the visitors from above complained and a good time was had by all.  To this day though I can't help but wonder: What was I thinking?

						   Zack attended private school until he completed eighth grade. Just after his graduation his father was laid off, while he found a new job almost immediately the reduction in salary required everyone in the family to tighten their belts. For Zack this meant leaving private high school behind and embracing the wonderful world of public education.  Therefore he was surprised when on the first day of school he ran across several friends who he had believed were attending the local private high school not RHS. As fate would have it their families had also ran into some financial setbacks making it necessary for their sons to abandon the private school route. While they had never hung out together he was pleased to know he was not the only new fish in the big pond.  Zack, while naturally somewhat of a loner never really had much difficulty striking up conversation and developing new friendships. His first weeks at RHS were no exception. Not that they were the type of friends destined for a lifetime by his side, they were however acquaintances who made the transition to public school much easier.  One in particular was Ryan Tibbit. He was a lifetime public schooler but Zack did not hold that against him. They had been seated next to each other in first period study hall and soon realized they shared a common passion: baseball. While the other students were rushing to complete unfinished homework they discovered that each of them had their textbook open with the local sports page buried inside. The clincher was that they were both reading an article regarding the previous nights Dodger game. Though they lived several hundred miles outside of Los Angeles it turned out they both bled Dodger Blue.  They began spending breaks and lunch together, discussing the standings and the possibility of the boys in blue returning to the world series. They both felt the drought had gone on long enough and were ready for some post-season excitement. Zack soon discovered that Ryan and him had something else in common: they both had world-class baseball card collections passed from their father's. Soon plans were being made for Ryan to ride the bus home with Zack on the following Monday so they could compare and swap cards.  Monday came and the boys found themselves sprawled on the floor in Zack's room pouring over binders filled with baseball cards. They found that between the two collections that Ryan owned the rarest overall card while Zack owned the rarest Dodger card. A transistor radio was soon added to the background as the velvet tones of Vin Scully called the action for the day's game.   Time passed and before they realized it six o'clock had come and gone. Ryan called his mom to come and pick him up. They began to clean up the cards when Zack's father returned from work. Zack called for his dad and asked him to come into his room to meet his new friend.  Mr. Wilson stood in the doorway while his son made the introductions.  "Nice to meet you Ryan. Would you mind if I borrowed my son for a moment I need to have a word with him in private." "Not at all Mr. Wilson, Zack and I were just cleaning up my mother should be here in a few moments to take me home."  Ryan returned to cleaning up the cards while Zack followed his father into his parent's bedroom. Mr. Wilson shut the door behind them and Zack began a mental checklist attempting to determine what house rule he had broken.  His father toward him, his face was red and he appeared to be fighting a losing battle to remain in control of his temper. "May I ask what that kid is doing in my house?"  Zack gave his father a puzzled look; he had often had friends over after school. "We were trading baseball cards, my homework is done and you never said I could not have friends over after school."  "Zack you are not understanding my point what is that particular friend doing in my house?"  "Dad I do not understand the problem, he is just a friend from school. Why is it such a big deal?"  "I will tell you the big deal Zack, your "friend" Ryan is black and I do not want him inside my house. You go back to your room and get him out. I do not care what you tell him but you are never to invite him over again and I also do not want to here that you visited his house. Do I make myself clear?"  "But Dadâ€¦"  "No buts. Move it mister. This matter is closed and you will do as I say."  With that Zack's father walked into the bathroom and slammed the door.  Zack was frozen in place his eyes were filled with tears of mystification.  He knew his father had grown up in the south but until this very moment he had not know that his father was prejudiced. For his part while he realized that Ryan was black it had never dawned on him that this could somehow make him different. He was just a kid like him who loved baseball. Why did adults have to make the world so complicated? What was the point in judging others by their DNA strands?  Zack dried his eyes and made it out of his dad's room just as Ryan was heading for the door his mom was waiting for him in the driveway.  "Thanks for coming Ryan. I had a great time you have an excellent collection."  "Thanks for having me Zack. Is everything OK you look somewhat stressed"  "Its no big deal my dad was mad at me for having company over without him or my mother being home. He laid down the law. No more after school visits for anyone." Zack could tell by the look in Ryan's eyes that he did not believe him. He must have sensed something when his father had come into the room. Zack stood in the doorway and sadly watched his friend drive away.  The next day at school things were different. Ryan and him still talked but Zack could already sense them drifting apart. Friendships were difficult enough to maintain without one friend being banned from the other friend's house for racial reasons. Soon Ryan began hanging with a new group in study hall and Zack often found himself pondering the seeds of hate that still blossomed throughout the world.  Postscript: Zack's younger sister was five years behind him in school and had their father wrapped around her little finger. By the time she left private high school he had mellowed with age and Ashley was able to bring home friends of any nationality or race without a peep from dear old dad.  Zack observed the comings and goings of Ashley's friends with a bemused expression on his face. I guess old dogs can learn new tricks and his dad was the proof in the pudding.

						   My father's last appearance in my life occurred in 1971. He had recently remarried and moved to Bishop, California where he had opened a lodge. In hindsight it was not the best career choice for someone who was swimming in a sea of alcoholism.   He had not had any contact with us for several years, partially because of his marriage to the bottle but mostly because he was not paying child support and he did not want to end up in jail.   His appearance was a surprise but was I am sure at the behest of his new wife. They only stayed for a couple of hours and as usual he was clueless when it came to gifts for his daughter. My sister received a dress that was four sizes to big and just as many years out of style. I cannot remember what he brought my brother but his new wife gave me a book on the Indians of Central and South America, which I still have.   A quick aside, I have never referred to her as my stepmother because this was our one and only meeting. They were divorced not much more than a year later.  The last time my father and I spoke was in early 1980. Once upon a time he had belonged to a local lodge and one of the members heard through the grapevine that he was ill and came up with a phone number, which they passed along to my mother.  Ill was an understatement. After years of alcoholism and smoking unfiltered Camels he had not only lung cancer and liver cancer but also brain cancer. According to the lodge members source he had no more than a year left.  I called him one afternoon from a friend's house, not wanting to open any old wounds at home. When he came to the phone a sob caught in my throat he sounded so old. In reality he was only 44 at the time but you could not tell from the timber of his voice.  We made small talk. He asked me how I was doing and how my brother and sister were. We discussed the Dodger's and baseball in general. He asked about my mom. Our conversation was all over the map but somehow we avoided discussing his fate. Maybe he was just trying to protect me from the bad news. He might not have even known that I knew. Whatever the reason our phone call lasted about thirty minutes and I never spoke to him again.  Flash forward six months. I walk in the door just in time to hear the phone ringing.  "Hello?"  "May I speak to Pat?"  "She's not home right now. May I take a message?"  "Whom am I speaking to?"  "This is her son Darrell." "Well Darrell you do not know me. My name is G and my husband and I have been taking care of your father for the past two months. This is hard to say to someone I don't even know but I have to tell you that your father passed away today."  I almost dropped the phone. My father was dead. Even though I hardly knew he was still my father. As I groped for something to say G continued to speak.  "I also wanted to tell you what a rotten no good son you are. Your father has been living near us for the past six months and you did not bother to call, write or visit. Your poor father died with no one by his side but two almost complete strangers. I hope you can look yourself in the mirror at night because as far as I am concerned he would have been better off without children."   CLICK!  Before I could respond she hung up on me. I was shocked. How could someone speak like that to a teenager who had just lost his father? Obviously there was no way to explain the history of our family. No way to explain that after we last spoke he had moved again and I had no way of contacting him. Of course with her hanging up on me any explanation was beside the point.  I walked out the door into a night that was cold, wet and windy. Without a jacket I wandered the streets until I ended up at my best friends house. Her mother let me in and we sat for hours playing gin rummy and talking about my dad.  For many years I carried a lot of what ifs with me concerning my dad and anger toward the lady who called that evening. However, what ifs will not bring my father back and any family reunion will have to wait for some other place or time. He may not have been a great dad but he was still my father and he had his demons that he could never escape.  I am no longer carrying a grudge toward G. She did not know me. Her only knowledge of our lives came from my father and I have no way of knowing what he had told her. From her perspective all she saw was a man dying alone far from the home of his youth and the children he had loved. With nothing left to show for his life but,to quote from one of my poems:  A faded picture From long ago Of three small children He used to know

						   As I reviewed my mothers photo albums over Memorial Day weekend I stumbled across several photos of an object I have absolutely no memory of. According to the photographic evidence, which I cannot dispute, we had a clubhouse in our backyard from 1965 until we moved in 1970.  Now I was ten years old in 1970 and I should have some tidbit of memory left from that year. Obviously though the brain cells where evidence of this clubhouse were stored have been damaged over the years. Maybe I should have a heat sink installed inside my brain to keep it from over heating.  Apparently sometime in 1965 I made a big ruckus wanting to know why we did not have a clubhouse at the time. My sister was only two and my brother one so the request had to have come from me yet I do not remember it.  At the time my father worked for a company in Burbank called Zero Manufacturing. They were a company that made various types of machines for factories around the world. One day some large piece of equipment was delivered to the plant inside a large wooden box. My dad took one look at it and decided it would be perfect for building a clubhouse.  He brought it home and along with my mother went to work. They cut a doorway and four holes for windows into the box. My father took some wood and made door for it complete with hinges and a doorknob. From the photographs it appears that they used actual glass for the windowpanes but my mother cannot remember for sure. My father put a roof on it complete with shingles. My mother than painted the outside white with blue trim. She even hung little curtains in the windows.  According to mom this was our absolute favorite toy. We played in it every day for the next five years. When my mom and step-dad sold the house in 1970 we begged them to take the clubhouse with us but they refused. So we parted ways after five years of fun.  I wish I could conjure up some kind of memory concerning this clubhouse but I cannot. It is almost like I accidentally when it comes to that one part of my life in the late 60's.

						   More reminiscing from the river, my mother shared with me a story she never had before concerning earliest brush with meeting a celebrity.  It happened in 1961 or 1962. I was two years old and making my first aware trip to Disneyland. Baby trip do not count because all you do is sleep in the stroller and you are oblivious to the ongoing show.  As we roamed the park we had made our way towards Frontierland, which at the time contained an Indian village complete with an Indian chief. According to my mother the chief fascinated me and I cried when she began to walk away. The chief took notice and walked towards us. He held out his arms and my mother says I ran right to him as if I had known him all of my life.  I guess I was in seventh heaven and did not want to leave. So my mother stood there with the chief while I pulled on his war bonnet and they made small talk.  It was at this time that one of Disneyland's old-fashioned automobiles drove up and stopped near where we were standing. The occupants of the car were a princess from a country that my mother has long since forgotten and Walt Disney himself. Walt according to legend enjoyed giving visiting dignitaries personal tours. He was pointing the sights and sounds of Frontierland out to the princess when he noticed my Indian chief and me.  He beckoned to the chief who along with my mother carried me over to the car. He introduced himself and asked my mother if we were enjoying the park. All the while though he kept watching me interact with the chief, finally he asked my mother if he could hold me. She replied of course and the chief began to hand me over to Mr. Disney. I however would have nothing to do with him. I didn't cry but I also did not let go of my Indian. No matter how they tried I would not allow Walt to hold me.  According to my mom Mr. Disney got a kick out of the whole thing. He told her that he thought she had a lovely family. He told her to have a great time in the park and went about his tour.  As for my Indian chief my mother was finally able to pry me out of his arms but I cried all the way out of Frontierland.

						   From a distance Josh moved like a tight end weaving his way through the secondary. With a leather briefcase in one hand and a cell phone to his ear, he conducted business on the sidewalk as he headed to the office. He rarely noticed those who shared the sidewalk with him. When they did come to his attention it was only long enough to curse them after a collision.   By all definitions Josh Stevenson was a Type A personality who with all things being equal would probably drop from a stroke or a heart attack before the age of 55. He was an ad executive who handled the accounts for several fortune five hundred companies. He brought home six figures a year not including bonuses. His house and garage were filled with all of the toys that any self-respecting thirty-something would covet.  Josh kept his eye on the ball and dreamed of one day owning his own ad agency. He allowed no distractions to interfere with his long-term goals. He never took the time to stop and smell the roses, watch a sunset or even remove his shoes and walk barefoot through the warm afternoon sun.  On this particular Monday Josh was late for a meeting with a client and was impatiently making his way to the office. He never saw the homeless man or his son until he tripped over the dad and went sprawling across the sidewalk. His suit was ruined and he came off the ground with fire in his eyes ready to give the man a piece of his mind.  As he turned towards the father he noticed a broken wheel chair sitting next to him. Looking down he saw that the homeless man was paralyzed, most likely from the waist down. Still the man should have been more careful about where he sat.   He was ready to give the dad a piece of his mind when he noticed tears forming in the son's eyes. Despite his obvious fear the boy stepped between Josh and the father. With shaking hands and a quivering voice he stood up to Josh.  "Mister I am sorry that you fell, but you really should look where you are going. My daddy's legs don't work anymore and he cannot move them out of the way." While he spoke the boy picked up Josh's cell phone which lay unnoticed on the sidewalk. He brushed it off and returned it to him.  Angrily, Josh shoved the phone in his pocket and looked at boy and his father with scorn in his eyes. "I am not concerned with your fathers problems or yours for that matter. If he cannot move out of the way he should not be on the sidewalk. You and your father have managed to make me late for a very important meeting. My lateness could cost me and my employer a lot of money."  The boy appeared to shrink into himself but he still managed to stand his ground. "Mister we would not have been on the sidewalk if my dads wheelchair had not broken. My dad is trying to find work to support us but he is unable to make it to any interviews without a chair. Could you maybe spare some cash to help us get another wheelchair? I saw one down the street at a thrift store it was only twenty dollars. Could you help mister? Josh almost laughed right out loud. "First you make me late for a meeting and now you have the nerve to ask me for help. I admire your guts kid but I did not become wealthy man that I am by wasting money on those without the wherewithal to climb the ladder of success. If your poor it is your fault not mine."  He turned to leave but the little urchin grabbed the back of his jacket and stopped him.  "Please mister. We have already slept against this wall for two nights. I cannot move my father by myself. If I get the other wheelchair I can take my dad to the shelter for a hot meal. Mister just a few..."  Josh cut him off. "I do not have money or time to waste on people like you. Why don't you walk to the shelter and ask one of the bleeding hearts that runs the place for twenty dollars and leave me alone."  With that he stormed off, brushing his suit, straightening his tie and calling his client on the cell phone to say he had been detained but was on his way. He did not look back and he never saw the tears in the little boys eyes or the defeat in the fathers.  Later that evening Josh left his building and headed for the subway. He was still furious at the day's events. The collision with the old cripple had led to him being late for the meeting and to his company losing the opportunity to close a multi-million dollar deal. While his boss had been understanding he knew that the memories of those in upper management were long and today's debacle could come back to haunt him.  He came around a corner and was immediately blinded by a sea of flashing lights. Fire trucks and police cars filled the street. Josh was about to cut across traffic to the other sidewalk when he realized a crowd was gathered where he had tripped over the old cripple earlier today.  With growing dread he edged his way through the crowd until he could see what was happening. What he saw would give him nightmares for weeks. A car, driven by a drunk driver jumped the sidewalk and crushed the father and son against the wall, killing them. There was blood everywhere. The broken wheelchair was unscathed by the accident and filled Josh with guilt.   "Twenty dollars," he thought to himself. "Twenty dollars and they would have been long gone before the car jumped the curb. Hell I spend that much tipping waitresses on Friday nights I could have given the boy that and more."  The sound of the boys voice came back to haunt him. "Please mister all I need is twenty dollars to get the chair and take my father to the shelter."  With a heavy heart and tear filled eyes Josh shuffled away from the accident.  He did not remember the subway ride or even driving to his home in the foothills. One minute he was at the scene of the accident the next he was sitting on his deck overlooking the valley. However, for the first time he could remember he did not notice the view or anything else for that matter.  The events of the day kept playing over and over again in Josh's mind. If, if, if, all of the ifs were driving him mad. One gesture was all it would have taken and two human beings would still be alive. But know that was too hard for him. He was to busy being Josh Stevenson ad executive to notice the important things in life.  As he sat there on the deck through the long night Josh realized that the events of the day had brought him to a crossroad in his life. He could move forward as if nothing had happened and keep living life the way he had. Or he could change his lifestyle completely. He knew himself to well to believe that halfway measures would work. He was to addicted to success to cut back and remain in the industry. He had to either walk away completely or not bother changing at all.  In the east the sun was just coming over the horizon when Josh came to a decision. He could not let the deaths of those two human beings go for naught. They may have died but in doing so he thought, they may have saved me. All that I have done before today meant nothing to the universe. From this day forward I am going to contribute, to make a difference, to become a man who can be proud of what he sees in the mirror.  As the sun warmed the chill from his bones Josh entered his house and took the first baby steps of his new life.  Unseen by Josh three spirits remained on the deck in the morning sun. The boy, his father and one who shown with the brilliance of a full moon. They exchanged smiles and slowly dissipated.

						   I spent Memorial Day weekend in Bullhead City, Arizona visiting with my mother. Most of the visit was spent in Laughlin and Las Vegas, Nevada as my mom's favorite past time is playing video poker. I did however find time to revisit our families history by perusing the many photo albums my mother has put together. One of the pictures that captured my imagination was of my great-grandfather Quinto Spelta with his parents that was taken circa 1895. The photograph brought to mind the stories my grandmother used to share about the old country and its traditions.  Just four generations ago in Italy arranged marriages were still the norm.   On a clear day in 1893 Quinto noticed my future great-grandmother Maria Scribante, thirteen at the time, coming home from the bakers. With just that glimpse he lost his heart and made a promise to himself that she was the girl for him.  He returned home and announced to his parents that he had found the person that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Of course, they were taken aback. Tradition did not allow for children to choose their spouses. He had to marry whom the family chose. His father asked about his son's new found love but he had no facts to share he did not as of yet even know her name.  He worked on his parents for several weeks and their resolve did eventually weaken. They told him to find out who his mystery woman was and where she lived. Armed with that information his father would approach the family about arranging a marriage.  Eventually the fathers met and without too much squabbling they were able to come to an agreement. When Maria turned eighteen Quinto and her would be allowed to marry. Unlike most arranged marriages the bride and groom were introduced once before the wedding. They did not have to wait until the walk down the aisle for their first look at their spouse.  Quinto and Maria enjoyed a long and fruitful marriage. Seven children and a move from Italy to Missouri were only two of the grand adventures that they enjoyed. The beginning of their marriage may not have been built on love but over the years they built a foundation that was meant to last.

						   Captured by cupids arrow she fell once again into the arms of a man.  The stars were aligned. The soundtrack was perfect.  Hours spent talking through the night. Discovering shared experiences. Comparing similar battle scars.  Days passed. Love went from an abstract thought to a viable possibility.  Her heart long frozen began to thaw. Her soul once again found itself in sync with another.  In each other's arms they rediscovered the lost songs of creation. Passion. Fear. Love. Heartache. Creation. Destruction. Infinity discovered in a finite moment.  Alone once again she questioned. Am I ready to love? Am I prepared to share my heart with another? Without expectations? Without preconceptions? Without promises?  She accepted that the past was the past. Mistakes made were only mistakes if she had failed to learn the provided lesson. That was the question. If she was incorrect, would she in the final analysis have the strength to walk away? Even if that meant leaving a possible soul mate behind.  In the experience would lie the proof.  Days and nights passed as one. Her heart alone for so long became intertwined with his. Their love reflected a future that she had dreamed impossible. She was beginning to believe in the impossible and in a journey shared with this wonderful man.  Disappointment and heartache however are like earthquakes unpredictable and damaging.  Outside the window the blue moon shown brightly upon the sleeping city.  On the couch she was swimming in his vision, lost in his scent. Alive impossibly alive.  Distraction came in the ringing of the phone. He excused himself and came back in a few minutes.  "Sorry about the interruption. Now where were we?"  Doubt begins to creep in.  "Who was it?"  "My ex. She wanted to ask me something. It was no big deal."  So he thinks. Doubt grows bigger. "Are you sure?"  "What is this? Of course, I am sure. We broke up a while ago. We were close though and I was close to her family. We have tried to remain friends."  Doubt has been replaced by certainty.  "Have you been with her since you broke up?"  "A few times. Not since I met you though."  Back to doubt.  Lips meet and he scoops her small frame from the couch and carries her to the bedroom. Windows open. Moonlight streaming in. Their soundtrack the sounds of the night. Crickets and owls calling to each other. She is lost once again in his arms.  The phone brings her crashing back to reality.  This time he talks for fifteen or twenty minutes.  Doubt is back in a big way.  "Boy that was bad timing wasn't it?"  "Let me guess. It was your ex again."  She can tell by the look in his eye that it was.  Certainty settles in.  "I better go."  "Why? Just because she called a few times does not mean anything."  She pulls him to her chest and holds on for dear life.  "I'm sorry", she says. "I have played this role so many times that I know not only my lines but your lines by heart. I know the stage directions. I know the cues. I know when the audience will applaud and I know when they will cry."  He doesn't speak but she can feel his warm teardrops and she can hear his quiet sobs.  "Many great women have played this role. Some better than others. However the role of healing lover is a thankless one. Those of us who have made this part our own rarely receive a reward. No Oscar. No Emmy. No Tony. We pick up the pieces of the heart she broke. We become nurse, caretaker, lover, and best friend. It is our arms comforting you as the sorrow pours from your veins. It is our love that nurtures you until you are strong enough to face the world again. What is our reward? Our thanks? Nine times out of ten when you are well enough you either return to the bosom of the one who did this to you. Or you tell us you need some time alone before falling in love again. Next time we see you though, you have your arm wrapped around a beautiful blonde and you are clearly over any reservations where love is concerned."  His tears have stopped but he is unable to look her in the eye.  "Not this time. You gave my heart new life. You taught my soul a new dance. In my visions of the future I can see us growing old together. However, you have a shadow. The shadow of your most recent love. You may be over her. You may still love her. Not that it matters because you are not over her. If you were you would have still been lying with me in bed. You would have let the phone ring. Or let the machine pick it up. You chose to answer it which tells me you are still conflicted"  She was fighting back her own tears. Knowing the lessons was easy. Putting them to practical use was the hard part.  She stood up and gathered her things.  "Now walk me downstairs and kiss me goodbye.  Time is on our side. However, now is not our time.  Maybe someday when her shadow has been erased and the scars she created have healed we can try again. Not today. Not now. I have worked to hard to heal myself. To grow. To evolve. It would be the worst of sins to throw all I have learned away. This time I will be the one to walk. Does it hurt of course. Now do not take this wrong, but it actually feels good to be doing the right thing for me."  Her bus pulled up. She gave him a last warm lingering kiss and climbed aboard. Her tears did not begin until his shadow had faded into the distance. They did not stop until the bus driver tapped her on the shoulder and informed her that she must have missed her stop because they were at the end of the line.

						   They used to spend hours in the car. Driving through the foothills and canyons near their home. Windows down moon roof open and classic jazz on the stereo.  Some nights they drove until dawn. Discussing life. Discussing love. Following the paths opened by their hearts. Comfortable in what they had in common. Embracing the diversity of their differences.   Sometimes tears would mix with the sound of laughter. Sometimes their souls soared, entwined moving to the ancient music of the stars. Sometimes silence embraced them with the warmth of an old comforter.  The stars were their compass and love was their guide.  In the days leading up to the birth of their child there drives became shorter, closer to home.   Driving to Lamaze class one evening they happened upon a small field with a pregnant mare. They pulled over for a closer look. As they approached the fence the mare watched them with wary eyes, until finally she turned her back and continued grazing.   Returning to the car he placed his hand on the life growing inside her. Still amazed at the miracle that was developing before their eyes.  The mare became somewhat of a touchstone for them. They visited daily and she eventually became comfortable enough to walk up to the fence and nuzzle their hands. Sometimes they would bring sugar cubes or a carrot for her to nibble.  On the night she went into labor they drove by the field and saw that their mare had given birth herself since their last visit. A young colt was following his mother around the field. Soon they would be holding their own miracle in their arms.  A few days after the birth of the baby they brought him to see the mare and her colt. The two mothers admired each other's handiwork, proud parents through and through.  The drives continued but not as often with the reasonability of a new life they tended to stay home more. At least once a week though they would go visit the horses.  One Saturday morning they pulled their car over near the fence and were distraught to find their horses were gone. A realty sign announced the sale of the property and apparently the horses had left with the previous owners.  The empty field seemed to foretell future events. The honeymoon was over and reality began to sink in. What they once shared slowly became foreign to them. He began going to bed later. She began going to be at sunset.  Dreams and hopes were no longer shared. For reasons that neither one understand they were drifting apart. What they once held in common now seemed to drive a wedge between them.   He loved the outdoors. She wanted to go clubbing.  He still loved moonlit drives. She wanted to watch her soaps.  He wanted a home cooked meal. She began eating out of the microwave.  Even their beautiful boy who should have been the glue to make their bond permanent became a tool. He has too many toys. He doesn't have enough toys. He is to dirty. He's a boy he should be dirty. On and on it went.  Nobodies fault really. As it often happens when hormones are far ahead of maturity. The foundation of a relationship cannot always handle the strains of growth.  Eventually they had drifted so far apart that they agreed to disagree and they went their separate ways.  After the divorce their relationship actually improved. Without the weight of marriage they became friends again and partners in the raising of their son.  The world continued to turn and before long they each found love with another. Neither let their new marriage destroy the friendship that had grown from the seeds of their lost love.  One evening he was driving her and their son home from a Karate tournament they happened to pass by the field where their horse had lived. Pulling over they shared with him the story of her pregnancy, his birth and how they used to visit the horse.  To their dismay the farm was abandoned and the stable was choked with weeds. The beauty that had once occupied this piece of land had been lost and no one had come along to restore the lot to what it once was.  As they drove away he took her hand in his as if to say that unlike the owners of the stable we may have abandoned our marriage but we saved our friendship and we are building a future for our son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   Day 52 â€“ June 11, 2003: I visited the pulmonologist with a bit of hope and a lot of trepidation. I was hoping for an easy answer or a quick solution. I feared something worse, possibly emphysema, which killed my grandfather or lung cancer, which killed both my father and stepfather.  Of course a visit to a new doctor brings with it a slew of duplicate forms that must be filled out in triplicate before you are allowed past security into the holy grail of medicine: the waiting room beyond the waiting room. You know the one that you are led to after your name is called and you are thinking to yourself the wait wasn't so bad. Then the nurse has you take a seat. She asks you a few questions, takes your vitals and then informs you that the doctor will see you soon. She than quickly leaves the room shutting the door behind her.  At this point the butterflies were fighting to escape my belly. My breathing, which of course was already bad seemed to be more labored than usual. My eyes roamed the small room taking in my surroundings. I always bring a book to these appointments but I was unable to find the concentration needed to get past the first page.  Finally after what seemed like hours the pulmonologist came in and introduced himself. We then began the usual round of twenty questions.   Why are you here?  What seems to be the problem?  What are your symptoms?  Do you have any allergies?  On and on the questions went which I answered to the best of my ability. He examined my ears, nose and throat. Asked me a few more questions and than came to a conclusion. He felt that my problem must be allergy related and he wanted me to take a series of allergy medicines and steroids.  I had already explained to him the difficulty I have with steroids due to ongoing battle with panic disorder. However, in his opinion the dose of steroids he was recommending would not be enough to cause a panic attack. I was not convinced but I did agree to give it a try.  He had his secretary schedule an appointment for July 9th and he sent me on my way prescriptions in hand.  Day 55 â€“ June 14, 2003: When it comes to illness and medicine one should always listen to ones inner voice. I made the mistake of listening to my pulmonologist rather than my instinct when it came to the ingestion of steroids.  The evening of the 14th found me waiting in the emergency room of the local hospital fighting a losing battle with a severe panic attack. My blood pressure was through the roof. My entire body was shaking. My chest was constricted and I was sure this was the big one. On the other hand the small little logical part of my mind knew it was nothing more than a panic attack but logic is thrown out the window when primal instinct strikes.  When I finally saw the doctor she confirmed that I was having a panic attack and nothing more. She gave me a double dose of Xanex, recommended that I stay away from steroids and advised me to see my primary care doctor on Monday.  Once the Xanex kicked in and she saw that I was calming down she sent me on my merry way.  Day 58 â€“ June 17, 2003: With cough in hand I returned to the hallowed halls of my primary care physician. I had not seen her since my visit with the pulmonologist so I shared the tale and explained about the steroids and my visit to the emergency room. She seconded the ER doctor's opinion and suggested that my body become a no steroid zone. However, she was concerned about the increased frequency of my panic attacks even without the influence of steroids. I was already taking Paxil but the dosage did not seem to be working as well. She thought it might be time to see a psychologist but being my usual stubborn self I resisted the recommendation.  Day 80 â€“ July 9, 2003: I returned to the pulmonologist with no progress to show for the four weeks of treatment. I explained to him about the steroids but he just did not seem to understand. I had the feeling that he had never dealt with a patient who suffered from panic disorder. With my pet cough still following around and the wheezing of my lungs still obvious he recommended treatment plan B. A non-steroidal inhaler, a different brand of allergy medicine and a follow up visit in three weeks.  Day 101 â€“ July 30, 2003: the 30th found me oh so happy to once again be sitting in the waiting room of my pulmonologist watching three tropical fish swim around an oversized tank. They were probably wondering what I was in for. Three more weeks had shown no change in my condition. Cough check. Wheezing check. Panic check. Sick and tired of being sick check. Another patient doctor conference and Mr. Lung Expert is still stuck on his allergy kick. His recommendation was one new non-steroidal inhaler, new allergy medicine and three weeks until I visit again.   At this point I am ready to call in reinforcements but everyone swears that he is the best in the area. So I take me prescriptions to the pharmacy and I begin to seriously consider searching out a witch doctor. Hell he couldn't do any worse than the pulmonologist has so far.  Thus ends Lungs In Crisis II

						   Nights were the worst.  With his room enveloped by darkness his imagination took over. Each sound became amplified. Each shadow became a creature from Stephen King's fertile imagination. Sleep came slowly if it ever came at all.  Death haunted his subconscious. Debates raged inside his head.   God exists.  There is no God.  The soul survives the body.  When you are dead, you become worm food nothing else.  These flashing thoughts would cause his stomach to form knots that Houdini himself could not escape. His breath would catch in his throat while his chest felt like he was attempting to breath on Jupiter.   Panic would ensue.  Off the bed he would pace the house. Upstairs, downstairs and back again, roaming the hallways of his existence searching for peace finding only empty space.  The television beckons and he sits on the floor legs crossed like he was seven years old again watching cartoons on Saturday morning. The channels dance across his vision random samples of the midnight world. Filled with exercise videos, music collections and the latest greatest slicing and dicing tools for the kitchen. Nothing catches his eye. Nothing offers comfort to his tortured soul.  He looks at the phone but there is no one to call. No one who understands his late night fears.  TV off he roams the halls once again. Not unlike Scrooge waiting for his next ghostly visitor. He stops before a shelf of old novels. His fingers trace along the titles but tonight even the written word fails to offer comfort.  Back upstairs he sits in his rocker staring out into the night. Watching the wind create new and wonderful patterns as leaves are blown around the yard.   Chaos.  Maybe.  He opens his closet and pulls a dusty box down from the top shelf. Removing the lid his eyes roam across the contents.   Photos of his parents.  Letters from old girlfriends.  His high school ring.  Bookmarks and diaries.  Dusty memories all.  Buried beneath the memorabilia an old friend. Pickles the last remnant of his innocent child hood. A calico cat given to him by his great-grandmother, stained, faded and missing an eye Pickles was for him comfort.  Gently he removes Pickles from his decades old bed and cradles him in his arms. The scents of childhood still inhabit the fur barely.  He shuffles back to his rocking chair and curls up with a sigh. With Pickles back he soon drifts off into a sleep uninterrupted by visions of darkness.  &nbsp;

						   Either my memory has packed up and set off on an around the world cruise without me or I have simply unremembered moments in my life that should stand out.  For the second time in recent months I was dumbfounded to find that a family incedent that I believed to have remembered clearly has actually developed its own version of Londons' famous fog.  In mid 1980 a friend of my father's called my grandmothers house to pass on some disturbing news.  At this point we had not heard from or about my father for at least ten years.  He told my grandmother that my father had developed inoperable cancer in his bones, lungs and brain. He was terminal and he did not have long to live.  Now is when my memory took a wrong turn from the memories of the rest of my family.  For the past twenty-four years I have carried a black spot of resentment toward my mother. I had until this past weekend never told her but in my soul I blamed her for me not being able to see my father before he passed.  For reasons unbeknownst to me I believed that I had been planning to drive to Northern California to see my father before he passed. I even remember having an agruement with my mother about why she would not let me go. In my heart I remembered being depressed and rebelious for weeks because of her actions.  Fast forward to the present day. I am riding with my mom on the way to her house out in the Arizona desert for a week of R&R. Somehow we came upon the subject of my father's death. Before I knew it my heart was in my throat and my stomach had been left behind somewhere near Ludlow on Interstate 40.  According to my mother (and later confirmed my brother and sister) my dad's friend did call and explain the gravity of my fathers situation. He suggested to my grandmother that if we wanted to have a chance to say goodby we better come quick.  At this point my grandmother brought it to my mothers attention. She said she would be willing to take the Greyhound with my brother and I to go and see him. My mom was reluctent at first but finally agreed to buy the bus tickets so we could go.  My sister was not interested in going. To this day she does not call our father dad when she speaks of him. She calls him by his name. She felt he had deserted her and that their was no reason for her to go traipsing across the state to see him.  It all however became a moot point. The friend of my father called back and explained that he had spoken to my father and that he did not want his childrens last memory of him to be what he had become. A human pin cushion with needles and tubes running through out his body.  So in the end we never made the trip. The bitterness I harbored towards my mothe was wasted. She was not at fault.  As we drove down I40 with the setting sun warming our backs I confessed the grudge I had held against her all of these years and apologized for somehow placing the blame on the parent who has stood by my side for my entire forty-four years.

						   Day 1 â€“ April 21, 2003: It was the day after Easter and it began the same as every Monday does when you earn your paycheck chained to a desk just another drone in the orbit of planet bureaucracy. Rather than a starship of some kind my transportation was provided by the local transit system, which is the only way to travel if you are commuting to downtown Los Angeles. Rather than spend two hours each morning locked in a piece of barely moving tin on Interstate 10, I would nap for 45 minutes while the bus cruised at 65 mph in the specially designated bus lanes.  &nbsp;  On this particular morning as I exited my bus in the historical heart of downtown Los Angeles I noticed a bit of scratchiness in my throat. No big deal I thought most probably it was caused by a bit of irritation from the exhaust emitted by the many busses spitting out passengers on the corner of Temple and Main.  &nbsp;  My assumption concerning the cause of my bronchial irritation proved to be incorrect. My throat grew rawer by the moment and I developed a cough and slight fever. By the time my day drew to a close I was exhibiting all of the symptoms of a soon to be bad cold.  &nbsp;  Day 2 â€“ April 22, 2003: I woke up feeling quite a bit worse than I had the previous evening. I called the office and informed the chain of command that I would be on the DL for at least a few days. Now it was time to pull out the old rolodex and call my doctor to see exactly what trouble my body had gotten itself into this time. After a thorough exam my doctor's diagnoses was a rather bad case of bronchitis. This came as no surprise as I had suffered from bronchitis several times in the past. She gave me a prescription for some antibiotics and some cough syrup and told me to come back in a week. She also wrote a note to my boss excusing me from work until April 30th.  &nbsp;  Day 9 â€“ April 29, 2003: One week on the antibiotics and I have shown no improvement what so ever. If anything the congestion in my chest is worse I am beginning to sound like the little engine that could chugging up the steep hill. Except I was walking slowly on level ground. Another examination by my doctor showed that my bronchial tubes were still inflamed and a round of steroids would probably help reduce the swollen tissue.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Only one problem, steroids and I do not play well together. Besides my current health issues, I also suffer from Panic Disorder. Steroids, at least in my case love to mess with my central nervous system, which usually results in multiple panic attacks. Needless to say my doctor and I were both leery about introducing any type of steroid into the mix but it appeared to be somewhat of a necessity, at least if I wanted to improve my breathing skills. Which seemed to be a good idea at the time. In order to leave me with a bit of sanity we went with an inhaler rather than the pill form of steroids.  &nbsp;  Day 17 â€“ May 7, 2003: I finished the steroids and the antibiotics with no noticeable improvement. On the other hand I am sure that residents of the Artic Circle were feeling the after effects of my week on steroids. By day six on steroids the only thing keeping me sane was my treasured Xanex prescription. I was so happy to have my Xanex that I was considering writing to Pope John Paul II and nominating its creator for sainthood. I am sure that those who had to put up with me would have seconded the nomination without question. I returned to my home away from home better known as my doctor's office so she could tell me what I already knew. There was still no improvement.&nbsp; So begins the development of plan B, chest x-rays, blood work and a more powerful antibiotic. With my body in rebellion and no sign of the siege letting up anytime soon my doctor decided to play it safe and leave me off of work until June 2.  &nbsp;  Day 18 â€“ May 8, 2003: I spent the morning at the local hospital swimming upstream against the amount of paperwork required by the insurance company for a simple chest x-ray. Three hours later I was finally able to actually enter the x-ray waiting room where I was privileged enough to wait another hour before actually being x-rayed. On the other hand the blood work at a separate facility took all of ten minutes including blood drawing and form processing. Go figure.  &nbsp;  Day 24 â€“ May 14, 2003: My body remains in rebellion, I have a constant dry, unproductive cough that would have been fired by now for its lack of production. I have no more fever but I still feel less than my formal self. A sure sign that you have been sick to long is when the receptionist greets you by name before you have even signed in. Another round of poking and prodding and it appears that nothing has changed. Bronchial tubes inflame: check. Chronic cough: check. Shortness of breath: check. My blood work showed a slight elevation in the white blood cells, which is to be expected. The chest x-ray was normal so at least initially we can rule out pneumonia and tumors. Stumped my doctor decides it is time to bring in one of those mysterious specialists in this case the dreaded pulmonologist. Also, since she has experience in navigating the rocky waters of insurance referrals she wisely extends my disability to June 23.  &nbsp;  Day 31 â€“ May 21, 2003: I received my referral from the insurance company giving me their blessing and graciously allowing me to visit the pulmonologist of their choice. Of course calling his office required another lesson in patience. I am beginning to believe that insurance companies are God's modern day equivalent of the trials and tribulations of Job. God is just testing our faith in the system. When I was actually able to get through to the office of the pulmonologist I was informed that they were booked through the 11th of June. I begged, I pleaded, I whined and I even asked for some addresses of those ahead of me on the schedule so I could attempt some form of bribery. It was all to no avail though she sympathized with me she was unable to move me up on the appointment list. O' well you cannot blame a guy for trying.  &nbsp;  Thus ends part one of Lungs in Crisis.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Martin and Blake's friendship survived a twenty-one year roller coaster before jumping the tracks and coming to an inglorious finale. No one was to blame. It was just one of those things brought about by miscommunication, hurt feelings and two more friends were cast into the canyon of friendships past.  Why?  Why did this happen?  Their friendship had survived the test of time.  In 1979 a trip to Disneyland had ended in disaster. Martin and Blake had planned to go with their friend Krista and a friend of hers from out of town. Martin had assumed that the out of town friend was a blind date for him. When Krista came down with the flue he naturally assumed that Blake would be the "third wheel". What Martin was not aware of was that Blake and Krista's friend Lori had already met. A mutual attraction had already developed. All parties involved assumed that Martin was aware of the situation. He was not. Blake and Lori were lost in each other and oblivious to Martins feelings. They had a wonderful time and were unaware of Martin spending the night fighting back tears. He had been the third wheel one to many times and this time he was really hurt.  Once they had returned home. Martin called Blake and in no uncertain terms ended their friendship. Blake tried to apologize now that he was uncomfortably aware of the damage he had caused but Martin would have none of it. The two of them did not speak for several months. Until Blake heard through the grapevine that Martin had broken his ankle in a rock climbing accident. Blake swallowed his pride and called Martin to ask if there was anything he could do to help. Upon hearing from Blake, Martin realized that ending a friendship over a girl he had never dated was not very wise. He invited Blake over and they spoke long into the night repairing the damage to their bridge of friendship.  Several years passed and their journey through life went rather smoothly. They were always there for each other. No matter the time, day or night, it did not matter. All it took was the ring of the phone and one was always there to provide aid to the other.  Their friendship was interrupted once again when Blake got married. Martin was the best man at the ceremony and proud to be standing before the guests Blake's side. Martin and Rebecca, Blake's bride, however never got along. As their marriage progressed she slowly drove a wedge between Blake and all of his friends especially Martin. Blake was oblivious to the growing distance. He was happy. He was in love. Before long he had a son. His world was perfect or so he thought.   One day Blake sat down and took stock of his life. He began to realize that he was living a life that isolated from everyone except Rebecca. Not only that Rebecca's family hated him and did all they could to instigate problems between them. The worst part though was that Rebecca never came to his defense. Finally despite the love he had for his son Blake packed his bags, walked out the door and attempted to rebuild his life. Most of his friends had moved on. Some were married. Others had moved out of the area. But not Martin he was still there and still as loyal as ever. He never said anything about what happened. Their friendship picked up right where it had left off hardly missing a beat.  Several times over the next few years it was Martin who was dependant on Blake to be there to pick up the pieces. For a while it seemed as if Martin had a permanent case of heartbreak. Just has Martin's heart would heal from one breakup he would fall in love again only to be kicked in the gut once more. Many nights Blake would awaken to the sound of Martin quietly knocking on the door in need for someone understanding to talk to. Blake would listen and Martin would cleanse his heart and soul of all the fear and pain he was carrying around.  In the mid-eighties Blake's father passed away after a long illness. He was having a hard time dealing with the loss but Martin felt he had the perfect solution, a blind date. Blake was not interested in dating he just wanted to wallow. Martin insisted though and before he knew it Blake was looking into the eyes of his future.  Blake was gun shy after his first disaster of a marriage so he did not allow himself to fall to hard to fast. It was obvious to everyone else though that when Blake met Kelly his bachelor lifestyle was over whether he realized it or not. Blake was able to postpone the inevitable but eventually he gave in to fate and they were married.  No one was happier for the new couple than Martin. Especially since he had been friends with Kelly before introducing her to Blake he knew she would not come between them.  Blake and Kelly's marriage was as smooth as silk. Martin and Blake's friendship seemed to have settled into a comfort zone that would last until they were two old men sitting in rocking chairs in front of some old age home.  Alas it was not to be.  Martin was also friends with Kelly's sister Teri. The four of them spent quite a bit of time together. In some circles it was assumed that eventually Teri and Martin would fall for each other, however the time never seemed to be right.  Several years after they were married Kelly's sister Teri developed a series of illnesses. Teri spent the next year being visited by a parade of doctors with various specialties. She had one surgery after another. As her various medical problems grew worse Teri withdrew into a shell. Before long she only wanted to be visited by her immediate family and no one else. It was part of her defense mechanisms in action.  The less people visited the less she was required to face the seriousness of her situation.  There came a time when Teri's primary doctor gathered the family for a serious discussion. Teri had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and he needed to discuss treatment options. Once the doctor left the room Teri asked her family including Blake to promise not to tell anyone. She would tell whom she wanted when she wanted. She specifically asked Blake not to mention one word of her illness to Martin.  Of course this put Blake between a rock and a hard place. Martin was his best friend and Teri was family now. However in his heart he felt Martin would understand. A promise is a promise and Blake had always prided himself on keeping his word.  He couldn't have been more wrong.  Teri's mother accidentally let her diagnosis slip out when she ran into Martin and his mother at the grocery store. Martin immediately called Blake demanding an explanation. Blake was honest he had made and kept a promise. The same way he had kept promises for Martin over the years. He tried to explain to Martin that it was Teri's illness and that she had the right to disperse the news as she saw fit. It was all to no avail.  Blake and Martin began to drift apart. Issues that in the past would have been nothing became stumbling blocks. The final straw came when Blake was unable to attend the funeral of Martin's grandmother. The funeral conflicted with one of Teri's cancer appointments. Blake had become Teri's advocate for all of her treatments. No one in her family really understood all of the issues and were to emotionally upset still to discuss treatment in a professional manner.   Blake understood that by missing the funeral he was risking the end of his and Martin's friendship. It was a risk that he was prepared to take. He did not mean to be harsh in his opinion but Blake felt that this was a time where his family had to come first. So he missed the funeral.  The day of the funeral marked the end of their friendship. They spoke a few times afterward but it was never the same. They both had said things that they probably regretted and now the bridge was broken and most probably beyond repair.

						   For the most part with this journal I have avoided politics. Discussing hotbed issues can be a no win situation for someone such as myself who has spent the past six months writing about my life experiences and creating various types of fiction and poetry. That being said with this piece I am going to dip my big toe into the waters of controversy not necessarily by voicing a hard formed opinion but providing some background material concerning the origins of some of societies wedding traditions. The following is not intended to be an end all discussion of traditions but more of a brief peek behind the curtain so maybe we can understand why we do what we do and also understand that marriage like most of our customs has continued to evolve over the centuries.  Best Men: Once mankind began to settle into villages and towns there would often times be a shortage of brides in a particular settlement. The "groom" and his "best man" would often visit a neighboring community with the intention of stealing a "bride". Once the happy couple returned to the "grooms" village the wedding would take place almost immediately. The "best man" or "men" would stand to the grooms right facing entrance of the church. This position allowed them to watch the grooms back in case the "brides" father attempted to interrupt the ceremony.  Bride and Grooms Position: The "bride" would stand to the left of the "groom" to keep his sword hand free. If trouble developed he could keep the "bride" behind him with his left hand while removing his sword with his right.  On a side note: because there was always a chance that the wedding ceremony would turn into a battle often times church alters had an arsenal of hand held weapons hidden beneath them.  Carrying the "Bride" over the Threshold: There are at least two version of the origin of this tradition. Version one states that the "bride" was carried over the threshold because of her position as a captive not a willing "bride". Version two holds that the tradition of carrying the bride over the threshold began because of a superstition that evil spirits would enter the couple's new home through the soles of the bride's feet. It has also been said that the carrying over the threshold was to prevent the bride from stepping left foot first into her new home which also would lead to bad luck.  Wedding Banns: Charlemagne who in AD 800 became the Holy Roman Empire is said to have originated the practice of publishing wedding banns.  In the 8th century record keeping left a lot to be desired. Especially when it came to recording births and tracking the lineage of each child, since not every child's parentage was clear and because the amount of extramarital affairs that were happening it was not uncommon for half brothers and sisters to marry without realizing their relationship. To this end Charlemagne made it law through out his empire that a marriage must be announce at least a week before the actual event to allow for anyone who knew of a reason why the couple should not marry to come forth.  Groom not seeing the Bride: The tradition of it being bad luck for the groom to see the bride on their wedding day came about due to the wide spread existence of arranged marriages. To often it would happen that a groom who had never met the bride would see her before the wedding and not finding himself attracted to her would fail to appear for the ceremony.  So the fathers of the bride forbade the prospective groom to see her until they met on the alter.  Throwing of the Garter and Bridal Bouquet: The wedding night was a huge party and at some point in the evening male attendants would help the bride and groom to undress. With the men fighting over the garter with the winner wearing it on his hat. Once the happy couple were undressed they would sit on the bed and the wedding party would throw stockings on at them. The person who was lucky enough to land a stocking on the happy couple would be the next to wed.  Throwing Shoes: In the past shoes were thrown at the bride to ensure a bounty of children. In many cultures feet were considered a powerful phallic symbol and throwing shoes was preferred over the throwing of wheat or rice.  Wedding Cake: Originally the wedding cake was nothing but a bit of wheat bread that was thrown at the bride to guarantee her fertility. The Romans began to bake small, rather sweet wheat cakes that were meant to be eaten. The guests however did not want to abandon tradition so rather than eat the cakes they threw them at the bride. Eventually the custom evolved to where the cake was crumbled over the couple's head and than they would eat some of the crumbs again to guarantee fertility.  Our modern wedding cake evolved from the English tradition of stacking small biscuits and other baked goods. The higher the stack the more good fortune for the couple. Tradition says that a French chef while visiting London in the 1660's was shocked at the half-hazard way the baked goods were stacked. In response to what he had witnessed he developed the idea of a multi-tiered wedding cake rather than a half-hazard stack of baked goods.  Horn Honking and Wedding Bells: Our ancestors believed that loud noises would keep evil spirits away from the wedding. This evolved into wedding bells being rung at the church and later to horn honking when the wedding party leaves the church.  Honeymoon: One of the original reasons for a honeymoon goes back in time to the stealing of the bride. Once the wedding was complete the couple would disappear for a month or until the "brides" father stopped searching for her. When the couple returned the "bride" was usually pregnant and her family would than accept the marriage. The honey in honeymoon comes from the honeyed mead that was drunk at the reception. And of course as seen above the moon in honeymoon comes from the cycle of the moon that the couple would be away.  There are many other tradition both in the west and around the world. My reasoning for listing a few of them here is not to necessarily change someone's definition of marriage but just to point out that marriage like any other tradition that we celebrate has evolved and will continue to evolve regardless of what legal arguments we are having today.

						   The hologram must be failing because he was beginning to see that what he believed to be reality was something else.  He did not bother trying to explain. People would assume he was crazy and lock him away someplace. The masses choose to see the emperor's new clothes though reality was running naked through the time/space continuum.  Not unlike an adult who can no longer suspend their belief while riding the Small World attraction at Disneyland. He can see the strings. The fantasy is lost. The record is stuck and repeating small, small, small over and over again.  The mundane moments pass the way of a summer breeze that ruffles the leaves of the maple in the front yard. Like the maple savors the spices of the wind, he tastes the moment but the cage remains empty and the watch remains unwound.  Time has no meaning. Clocks and calendars are useful for categorizing and filing away memories in a dusty attic where they are neglected and filled with cobwebs and dust mites saved for a rainy day that never comes.   He accepts the changes that his new reality has brought to his perception. He accepts the changes without fear and without prejudice.  Hot weather only reminds him that soon he will be cold.  Hunger is only a reminder that soon he will be fed.   Pain is accepted as a precursor to well being.  Tears are but a sign of the laughter that will soon follow.  The mini dramas of life are but rehearsals for the souls eventual evolving.  Death is but another door that must be opened or another road that must be traversed.  He sat watching the sunset on a deserted beach or was he watching the beginning of a sunrise that someone unknown to him was watching in Japan. Whatever the reality was did not change the beauty of the moment.  He took a handful of sand still warm to the touch from the suns passing and watched as the individual grains returned to their own reality.  Was he insane? He could not answer a question that was unanswerable. If he was that was the reality of this moment and he would ride the currents where they took him.  If he was not than maybe his perception had become just a bit sharper, his senses just a bit purer and his mind just a bit more aware of the knowledge that had always been there for the taking.  Truthfully, it did not matter if the emperor had new clothes or not. What mattered was what lesson if any the emperor had learned.

						   When my mother finds a good hair stylist she will follow them through hell and high water to keep partaking in their quality work.  Case in point. The stylist my mom used in the late sixties and early seventies was originally located just a few miles from where we lived in Arcadia. When his salon became a success he moved the whole operation to Laguna Beach which is about a ninety mile round trip from where we lived.  Did she search out a new stylist? No. She followed him to Laguna Beach which was just fine by us kids because of course waiting for your mother on the beach is much more exciting than waiting for your mother in a smelly old salon especially during the summer.  Laguna Beach for those of you who don't know is a rather pricey beach town located along Pacific Coast Highway between Newport Beach and San Clemente. Laguna's most famous attraction is the Pageant of the Masters, which takes place every summer. During the pageant performers replicate the paintings of masters by appearing in costume and posing forming a living copy of the artists canvas. Words cannot convey the beauty of this event. Viewing the pageant for the first time would be similar to ones first exposure to Shakespeare on stage or on the screen where the words begin to come alive for the audience.  Today Laguna Beach is trendy, fashionable, and a hotspot where quite a few Southern Californians attempt to park and eat on any given Saturday. While in the seventies it was popular its popularity did not compare to today.  On hair styling day we would drive down to the beach with our mother where upon arrival she would set us free for a few hours while she spent her time being pampered and spoiled.  My favorite spot then and today has to be the tide pools of which there are several. During low tide you can climb over miniature coral mountains until you are approximately one hundred yards from the sand.   The coral at low tide becomes a landing strip and a restaurant for various breads of sea birds especially gulls and pelicans. A careful observer will spot fish, crab, jellyfish and other small creatures living and hiding in the various pools.  Once my exploring nature was satisfied I would always pull up a piece of sand and lose myself in a good book, periodically people watching and adding a bit of suntan lotion to my reddening skin.  Once in awhile I would hook up with some of the other kids on the beach and get in on a game of Frisbee or football. However, sooner or later I would find myself back on my towel lost in whatever that day's beach read was.  Today I may not make it to the beach as often and when I do I rarely go to Laguna, it is much to crowded, no matter where I am opening a good summer novel brings the smell of surf and sand back to overwhelm my senses.

						   Mike was oblivious to the life changing moment, which was about to happen. Sitting in his favorite rocker reading the paper and sipping iced tea his world was perfect or so he thought.  It was midnight. A humid July type of midnight when even with the windows open no air moved through the house and you found your clothes sticking to your skin as if you had just showered in them.  In the distance he could hear the song of the coyote's and the accompanying cricket orchestra. On the radio Art Bell was debating the existence of UFO's with Rob from Rochester.   The children were away at camp and Linda was asleep upstairs. For as long as Mike had known Linda she required a minimum of ten hours sleep per night, without it her mood swings matched the pressure changes in Oklahoma before a tornado. As for himself he was and always had been a light sleeper requiring no more than five or six hours per night.  Midnight had become his private hour. His time for unwinding from life's stresses time. Some nights he would escape with a good book. On other nights he would watch an old movie or maybe sit in the old porch swing and see how many shooting stars he could count. The activity was not important the time alone was.  Noticing that his iced tea glass was empty Mike wandered into the kitchen for a refill. He heard the floorboards upstairs squeaking, looking at the clock he assumed it was Linda coming down for a glass of water. Sure enough before he finished preparing his tea she shuffled sleepily into the kitchen.  "Can I get you some water, sweetheart?"  "I'm not thirsty I actually came down so we could talk Mike. We never seem to talk anymore so I waited until the girls were away at camp so we could have a private conversation."  Needing to talk was Linda's warning flag signaling that someone was in trouble and usually that someone was him. Suddenly Mike had a hollow feeling deep in the pit of his stomach. With budding trepidation he sat at the kitchen table waiting for Linda to drop her bombshell.  Without preamble she began; "Before the girls left for camp I discussed the possibility of us getting a divorce with them."  He was in deeper trouble than he thought. Where had the idea of divorce come from?  "Don't look so shocked Mike you know we have not been communicating well and for quite some time we have shared the same house while living separate lives."   Divorce, the girls and a lack of communication suddenly Mike did not feel so hot. "What shocks me Linda is not that the thought of a divorce crossed your mind . What shocks me is you being selfish enough to discuss something like that with the girls before they left for camp or for that matter discussing it with them at all. It would have been nice if we discussed it first and than if necessary share our feelings with the girls, not you arbitrarily and alone but us together."  "You see Mike this is why we never talk you are always making a mountain out of a molehill. We had a conversation, mother to daughters, no lawyers involved. I just thought they should know what I was feeling."  "That what it always comes down to Linda, what you feel, what you think, what you want, in your mind its your world and the rest of us are welcome to it. You are skipping a few steps in your little tirade here. Like communication, talking about our problems, our fears and our concerns."  "Mike what do you expect from me. I am at the end of my rope. I have not been happy for a while and I just wanted to discuss possibilities with our girls. I am not even sure what road the discussion would take but I thought it was only fair."  Even having spent the better part of his adult life attempting to translate Linda's thought pattern into reality was not helping him here. To her discussing divorce with their daughters was no different than debating, which flavor ice cream to select at Coldstones.   "Linda you are not playing fair. Not only did you talk to them behind my back but you waited until they were gone to tell me. Who knows what fears or confusion you  planted with your little talk. Now there is nothing I can do for them until they return. You really do take the cake Linda, you really do."  "Don't talk to me about fair Michael Hammond. Is it fair that we spent four out of the last five years taking care of my mother? Is it fair that after all we did for her she still left the bulk of her estate to Annie? Is it fair that just when we got our life back you ruptured two discs in your back? Is any of that fair Mike? Well I am sick and tire of life being unfair and if your feelings get hurt along the way so what. I am looking at the backside of my thirties and I do not have much time left to have fun and if that means having fun with someone else than so be it."  "GOOD NIGHT MICHAEL!!!"  Mike sat shaking at the kitchen table. Her voice still echoed in his head even as he heard her footsteps stomping up the stairs.   What happened to the innocent and loving girl I married?   Where did all of her pent up poison come from?   What had he done to draw such wrath from her?  What am I going to do?  Those and other questions followed Mike outside where he sank into the porch swing. As he looked up at the stars he thought to himself, "The sky does not appear to be all that clear this evening." As his hand absent mindedly wiped the moisture from his tear filled eyes.

						   Dressed in a gray suit, white shirt, black shoes and not tie he cut a rather dapper figure. He was probably eighty years old but he could have passed for sixty as he walked down the street.  He sat speaking to her, comfortable in his folding chair with an umbrella to keep most of the afternoon sun from his parchment like skin.  "Dora retired last week from the bank. They gave her a luncheon at one of those fancy resteraunts. She had prime rib and champagne. All of her kids were there and the Chairman of the Board even sent along a letter with a plaque."  "Little David will be starting kindergarten in the fall. He was so cute. On the final day of preschool they had a little graduation ceremony. When it was over he jumped into my lap. Talking a mile a minute. Did you see me grandpa. I graduated. Than for no reason at all he began crying. When I asked him what was wrong he said he didn't want to graduate, he wanted to stay at preschool with all of his friends."  "Harriet Trotter passed last week. She was eighty-seven. She had not been the same since Gregory passed last year."  "I saw the heart doctor today. He said that my ticker is in great shape and that barring accidents I might see one hundred."  And on he went. Discussing with her the weather, the Dodger's, world events and family gossip.  After an hour or so he arose from his seat and with some effort knelt on the grass. He cleaned away the dried grass and a few weeds that were growing near her gravestone. He placed a bouquet of yellow roses in some water and left them there for her.  He folded his chair and his umbrella and blew a final kiss toward his young bride. Walking slowly he made his way to his car.  If anyone had asked he would have smiled and said: "Genie and I were married for fifty years. The last two she was no longer able to speak because of the Alzheimer's that was eating away her brain. I guess I spent so many years talking to her I am just not comfortable enough to have much of a conversation with anyone else.

						   From the age of seven to the age of twelve my 4th of July's were spent at the Elks Lodge to which my parents belonged. The lodge was located directly across the street from a county part and a fireworks stand where we always purchased our evening entertainment.   Through out the day all of us kids could be found in the park-playing hide and go seek, ditch, football and Frisbee. We climbed trees and avoided the older kids with firecrackers at all costs. They enjoyed nothing better than dropping a lit package behind some unsuspecting pre-teen.  When the afternoon began to wane we returned by twos and threes to the lodge parking lot where a huge BBQ feast was in the process of being prepared. There were always dogs, burgers, ribs and steaks with all the fixings.  Once everyone had filled their stomachs to their hearts content all the kids would gather in a rope off area that had been set up just for us. With a few adults as chaperones we would light off all of our sparklers, blazing flowers and fountains. Some of the littler ones would cry but for the most part one and all enjoyed the spectacle.  By the time we finished it was time for the main event. One of the local groups put on a huge fireworks show every year and the lodge parking lot was a perfect viewing location with no fuss and no muss. With folding chairs and blankets adults and children alike were dazzled by the fire filled sky.  Unfortunately my twelfth year was the last year that the firework display was put on. The sponsoring group paid for each years show from the proceeds collected from firework sales the previous year. The stand was robbed at closing in the final year and they chose to no longer put on the shows.  From my twelfth year to the current year my 4th of July memories have been a hodgepodge of various events with no real tradition to bind each year to the next.  Several 4ths were spent at the Long Beach Marina watching the firework display from the shore. The best part of the event was that all of the rockets were launched from a barge in the middle of the harbor so there was not a bad seat in the house. The downside was the crowds, the parking and the innumerable amount of drunks; at least back then the marina was definitely not a place for young children.  One year the fireworks I witnessed were from the back seat of a buddy's car as we returned from a visit to Sacramento.  There is not much time for savoring the experience while doing eighty on Interstate 5.  Another year a group of us watched fireworks from a turn off along Highway 2 in the San Gabriel Mountains. Instead of one show we saw several dozen shows scattered about the valley below us.  Over a period of four or five years a group of us would park at or near the Rose Bowl to watch their yearly firework extravaganza. The area outside the bowl became a temporary community with everyone's children intermingling and families sharing fried chicken and beer. The last few years however the parking fee has become rather high reducing the ability for most families to afford it.  My worst 4th of July happened seven years ago. Upon returning home from the Rose Bowl I found a message on my machine informing me that my mother had suffered a major heart attack. She lives near Laughlin, Nevada and her habit of visiting the various casinos is the only thing that saved her life. She lives alone and if she had been home she would have surely died. While sitting at a slot machine she began to feel ill and began walking towards the door where she collapsed. The paramedics were able to stabilize her and from the local hospital she was airlifted to Phoenix where she had a stint inserted into one of her arteries.   Over the past few years the 4ths have begun to run together. Without a traditional event it almost seems like just another day. Maybe next year I will spend the 4th in Philadelphia, New York or Washington D.C. and see if I can jumpstart my enjoyment of Independence Day.

						   Today a group of us were discussing our most embarrassing moments and/or nicknames, since I have one of each I figured I would share my embarrassment with the net and post the stories.  My most embarrassing nickname came about because of my little sister A. I was four years old when she was born and around six when she began to speak. Like most children there were words she could say with ease and words she could not pronounce for years.   One of those words was spaghetti, which always came out of her mouth as psghetti.   The word however that appeared to give her the most difficulty was my name, Darrell. No matter how hard she tried she just could not manage to pronounce my name correctly. After awhile she just gave up trying and came up with her own name for me.  Dodo.  From the first time Dodo passed her lips it stuck. Even as she grew and was finally able to pronounce my name correctly she would still call me Dodo. To this day forty some years later when I call her the first thing out of her mouth is: "Hi Dodo."  I once asked her where the nickname came from and she had no idea. I asked my mother who also had no idea. Then along came the internet and a world of useless trivia was suddenly at my fingertips. After some researching I believe that I solved the mysterious origin of the Dodo nickname.  Apparently from 1965 to 1970 there was a cartoon here in the US called Dodo: The Kid from Outer Space. When I mentioned it to my mom and showed her an episode that has been uploaded to the web she remembered me watching it all the time with my baby sister. So not being able to say Darrell she picked up Dodo from the cartoon.  DODO - THE KID FROM OUTER SPACE "DoDo, the Kid from Outer Space, DoDo can go, go any place, With propellers on his heels, Antennas on his ears, He's the science-fiction pixie from a strange atomic race, DoDo, the Kid from Outer Space. DODO!!!"  If anyone is interested they can go to    ">http://www.toontracker.com   and look up Dodo and other cartoons from our childhood.  One of my more embarrassing moments happened when I was in seventh grade. I was rather innocent and did not know much about the birds and the bees. Some of the boys who were supposedly more knowledgeable than I. They were talking about men and women sleeping together. Which of course in my naivetÃ© I assumed meant sleeping together and nothing else.  Coincidently several families from the lodge my parents belonged to had spent the previous weekend at the Salton Sea which is an inland salt water lake in if I remember correctly the Mohave desert.  Anyhow the parents had separate rooms and they rented one room for all of us kids. Since the girls outnumbered the boys I ended up sleeping with two of the girls and thought nothing of it.  That is until school on Monday when all the in boys were talking about the opposite sexes sleeping together. Rarely did I find myself in discussion with this group of kids but upon hearing their topic I had to contribute my two cents.  Big mistake.  When I told them I spent the weekend sleeping with two girls they began to ask me all kinds of embarrassing questions about what happened. When all of my responses were negative and I explained that all we did was sleep you could have heard a pin drop. Than they all started laughing as they walked away.  It did not take me long to figure out where I had gone wrong. But it took several weeks for me to remove my foot from my mouth.

						   The sheets of his bed were tangled about his ankles. His pillows had been fluffed and punched to the point that they were useless for support. An empty glass lay on the bedside table its former contents forming a small lake on the floor.  He stared at the ceiling. His eyes were red and swollen from a lack of sleep or from crying it was difficult to tell the difference. His hair was a tangle of gray and blond and his face was covered with several days of unshaven stubble.  Sleep had not visited his room for several days and the air was musty with the scent of unwashed flesh. In the background a television hissed with the poorly written soap that was trying much to hard to be hip. He was oblivious though to the television and to his surroundings. At this point in time he was captured in a prison of depression with no hope for parole.  Simply put time would run out on his life before the calendar changed from September to October. The cause was unimportant. There was no hope and there was no treatment. All the doctors could offer were various drugs that before to long would leave him in a medicated stupor unaware of the passing of time until he slipped off into that long dark night.  Refusing the medicals staffs offer of medication he walked away from his life and drove off into the desert until he had found himself here in this small backwater town renting a room who's only previous occupants were a family of cockroaches.  He was 33 years old; he had no family, no close friends and now no life. In his mind he had always been planning for tomorrow. Tomorrow I will get married. Tomorrow I will have a career. Tomorrow I will see the world. His dreams had been filled with a thousand tomorrows but now his tomorrows added up to less than a month.  Regrets he had quite a few but the one that haunted him most was that when he took his last breath there would be nothing left behind to show that he had even lived. Sure in some dusty file cabinet in some small town there was a birth certificate and who ever passed for a coroner in this town would file a death certificate but that was it. Two pieces of faded parchment added up to the sum of one mans life.  He had done nothing to leave his mark. No mediocre artwork in some second hand store. No half written novel in a safety deposit box. No charity work. Nothing to show for this gift of life he had been given.  What tore at him the most was never having been a father. Never having witnessed the birth of his very own son or daughter. Never held the hand of a beautiful woman while they gazed in amazement at the little miracle they had created together.   Who was he kidding, ten years ago when the opportunity for fatherhood had presented itself his indecisiveness had allowed the chance to slip through his fingers. What right did he have complain about missed opportunities, he at least have been given the opportunity to live.  Her name was Victoria and for him at least it had been love at first sight. She was beautiful, funny, warm, passionate and full of life. They had worked in the same office building but in different departments.  Before long he was finding excuses to walk by her desk and just to say hello or to exchange a smile in passing. He was somewhat intimidated by her and could not gather the courage to directly ask her out. One Monday however they were discussing that night's football game and without planning to he ended making a bet on the games outcome. If his team won he would buy her dinner, if her team won she would buy dinner.  His team won.  The following night found them walking hand in hand through the sand on one of Southern California's many beaches. Their conversations flowed easily and the silent moments were warm and comfortable. To his surprise as the sunset she reached up to him and gently kissed his lips.  When she saw his look of astonishment she explained that she did not want to wait as long for their first kiss as she had for him to ask her out.  So began a long love affair with a woman that in all honesty had been his soul mate that is if there was such a thing.   They spent most of their free time together. Drives along the coast. Trips to Vegas. Long nights at one of their homes watching old Bogie and Bacall films. Everything was perfect.   He knew that she was waiting for him to propose but she knew that he was gun shy having been briefly married several years before. So she bided her time and waited for him to be comfortable with the idea. And she waited. And waited. And waited.  He was afraid of marriage and scared to death of the long-term commitment. He went so far as to buy an engagement ring but he never gave it to her. That is until it was to late.  One night she showed up at his door with pizza, beer and a somewhat timid look on her face. She barely spoke over dinner and sat quietly on the couch not really responding to him or the television.  Finally he got the hint and her turned off the television, he took her hand in his and asked her what was the matter. He almost hit the floor when she blurted out that she was pregnant.  A thousand and one thoughts and emotions went through his head all demanding individual attention.  I'm going to be a father.  Am I ready to be a father?  I'm going to ask Victoria to marry me.  Am I ready to get married?  He must have sat in stunned silence for to long because she finally asked him if he had anything to say. Instead of boldly asking her to marry him, he stuttered and floundered for the right words to say. When he finally asked it came out halfhearted and uncertain. Her eyes filled with tears and she left without saying goodbye.  He tried to make things right, but to be honest he did not try hard enough. He was scared of marriage, scared of parenthood and most of all afraid of all the responsibility. While the right words kept tumbling out of his mouth they both knew his heart wasn't in it.  When she brought up abortion he did not stand up and fight he muttered something about it being her decision and when she made it he drove her to the clinic.  The last time they ever spoke was on the way home from the clinic. The tears flowed and through her sobs she wanted to know what his problem was, why didn't you fight for us, for our baby. He had no words of comfort. He said nothing.  As she climbed out of the car she looked back at him with pain filled eyes and whispered: "Truth, all it would have taken is you speaking the truth with passion and meaning. I know you love me and you would have loved our child but you did not have the strength to say it and mean it. Now our baby is gone and so is our love."  The price he had paid for a lack of courage and commitment. Instead of sharing the last moments of a wonderful life with those he loved. He was instead lying on a sweat stained mattress in a seedy motel wondering what might have been.

						   My grandfather was a meticulous man, to the point that today some people might claim that he suffered from some form of Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder.  He was already retired when I was born. To keep busy he subdivided his property. He left the family home in front and had two more houses built in the back. He performed all of the maintenance that the two houses required.  In particular I remember the way he kept the lawns and gardens in pristine condition.  When he mowed a lawn, the grass was cut to a perfectly even height. Each weed he found attempting to put down roots was immediately removed. The grass along the fences, sidewalks and laundry lines was perfectly trimmed.  One of the rental houses had a rock and rose garden. Several rose bushes surrounded by a layer of white rock. Ten years after planting the roses and arranging the rocks the garden looked just as perfect. His secret: once a year he would remove and clean the rocks one section at a time. Before replacing the rocks he eliminated any weeds and put a sheet of fresh plastic down, the rocks were than laid out once again in the garden.  A tool used by him was never returned to garage dirty, each item was cleaned and placed in its proper location before he quit for the day.  His tool bench was kept in pristine condition. He had a collection of small boxes filled with screws, nuts and bolts. Each had its own box sorted by size and type. Another section contained a collection of washers. Each tool was arranged by type and than size.  Being a smoker he had several ashtrays, on his workbench, next to his chair on the porch, in the kitchen and one next to his recliner in the living room. Like everything else the ashtrays were cleaned immediately and returned to their location in pristine condition.  From the kitchen cabinets to his dresser drawers and his closet everything he owned was organized, folded, hung up or placed in its proper location. I can never remember walking in the house and finding dirty socks on the floor or empty cans on the counter. Dirty laundry was always in the hamper and his bed was always made before he left his room in the morning.  As the years passed I began to realize that without words he had been teaching me the meaning of pride in oneself and in ones work. He was raised in a world where pride in performance was the norm and not an exception. By his example he was attempting to pass that pride in performance on to another generation. Hoping to keep at least a part of the world the way he remembered it.  Today I cannot with all honesty say that I have lived my life by his example. In our to and fro world an organized life seems to be one of the ideals we have left behind. Clutter seems to be a natural byproduct of our time. I find that the hours of the day pass so quickly that I hardly have a chance to maintain much less get ahead. I am sure though that if we were still alive he would have words of wisdom ready to share with me. He would remind me that peace of mind can be found in a home that is clean, organized and uncluttered.  So in his honor I think I will get off of the computer and go clean out a closet.

						   I was fortunate enough to spend the better part of my youth growing up in the foothills of Monrovia, California. Many days, especially in the summer, were spent wandering through the canyons and hilltops of our local mountains.  When we first moved to the neighborhood, neither my brother nor I knew anything about hiking, following a trail or about any of the dangers such as poison oak and rattlesnakes. The first weekend spent in our new house found us exploring a small hill that was located not to far away with an abandoned water tower on the top. Rather than follow a trail we hiked straight up the front through brush and weed until we reached about the Â¾ mark. My brother who was in the lead slipped and knocked us both back down to the bottom of the hill. Our arms, legs and faces were torn and scratched by the fall. My brother got off easy though. As it turns out I have a severe allergy to poison oak while he can sit in the middle of the plant without contracting a rash. Me if I even look at poison oak I break out, so this was the first of many hours spent scratching my rashes.  For us kids the best part about growing up where we did was our streets proximity to the entrance of Monrovia Canyon.  The canyon is filled with wildlife, hundred year old oaks, streams and a beautiful waterfall.  Originally the canyon was settled by the Rankin family in the late 1800's. They had four children three who died in 1877 from an outbreak Typhoid Fever. In fact there is a memorial that marks their final resting place.  In the early 1900's a gentleman named Ben Overturff built a lodge that was a popular get away spot for about forty years. Mr. Overturff finally abandoned the lodge in the 1940's due to declining health. Today there is a trail that runs past the old lodge that is named in his honor.  None of the above history really mattered to us kids though. The canyon was our own personal playground. We blazed our own trails. We played army and hide and go seek. We chased squirrels and attempted to follow coyote tracks. Some mornings we were lucky enough to see deer wondering through the empty park. Raccoons scurried through the trees, while lizards and snakes could be found warming themselves in the summer sun.  One Thanksgiving while hiking with my cousin we attempted to climb the rock face of the waterfall, we made it about Â¾ of the way up before slipping and falling into the water below. We were lucky in those days the water was deep enough to break a fall. Today with droughts and what not the water is rather shallow and we would have broken our bones instead.  As we I older I ran the trails as training for the cross-country team. Rather than moving all the time I began to take the time to sit under one of the old oaks with a good book or just to meditate. Listening to the running water was soothing and always left me with a clear head.  Of course once I discovered girls the canyon became a romantic place to visit for picnics and watching sunsets.  All in all Monrovia Canyon was and still is a great place to escape the stress of the urban environment and still be within ten minutes of home.   urlLink http://www.ci.monrovia.ca.us/city_hall/public_works/canyon_park/canyon_park.htm

						   Day 102 â€“ July 31, 2003: I made a return visit to my primary care doctor. We once again discussed the stubbornness of my favorite pulmonologist. For the time being I decided with her input that I would stay the course before starting over with a new pulmonologist.  My primary care doctor is the type of doctor who would have felt right at home making house calls one hundred years ago. When she treats you she treats the whole person and she has become rather concerned about my lack of improvement. One her own time she has been doing some research and recommended a new series of blood work that might help her to pin down the overall cause of my problem.  She also sat down with me and we had a serious discussion concerning my panic disorder. She understood that I was thrilled at the idea of visiting a psychologist but she felt that at this time it was probably for the best.  Seeing how concerned she was I gave in and promised her I would do some research and call some psychologists in the area and see if I could find someone that I was comfortable with.  Day 103 â€“ August 1, 2003: Searching for a psychologist has proven to be rather more difficult than I expected. My first choice happened to be located in the same complex as my doctor was booked solid but she did put me on a waiting list and she promised to call when and if she had an opening.  The second name on my list had available appointments but he appeared to be rushed and I did not feel comfortable talking to him on the phone so I imagined talking to him would be more difficult in his office.  The next three names were all overbooked and promised to put me on their waiting lists.  By this time my frustration level was worse than my panic attacks so I made the decision to wait until I saw my doctor again and see if she had any recommendations.  Day 121 â€“ August 19, 2003: Once again I found myself fraternizing with my two fish friends in my pulmonologists office. I feel rather out of place when I visit his office because the majority of his patients appear to have been around when the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. However, considering the current working condition of my lungs I really have no choice so I gossip with the fish while waiting for my personal lung expert.  Once in his office we discuss my current condition and he listens to my lungs wheeze. He was rather surprised to find that I had still made no real improvement. This non-improvement finally spurred him into some belated action.  I was given a referral for a series of sinus x-rays, a ct scan of my lungs and a sputum test. For now he is also eliminating all of my inhalers and allergy medicines. The only medication he wants me to take is something called Benzonatate, which are capsules designed to reduce coughing in patients with lung problems.  Day 123 â€“August 21, 2003: Back for another visit with J my primary care doctor. We discussed the lung experts latest recommendations and we both agreed that thought the forward movement was small progress was being made. My blood work came back normal none of J's latest hunches paid off. Which overall is a good thing since some of the diseases involved would not have been fun to deal with.  As I was leaving I noticed a stack of cards with the name of the psychologist who had been my first choice. I mentioned to J that I had yet to be successful in finding a therapist. I showed her the card in my hand and explained that this had been the one I hoped to see but she was booked solid.  J gave me a big smile and explained that the psychologist also a J who I will call JG was a friend of hers and always held a spot open in case she had a referral. She told me to give JG another call and she was sure things would work out.  Upon leaving the office I did just that and left a message on JG's machine. Within minutes she called back and with a laugh told me that dropping J's name was the key to the door and that she would find a way to squeeze me in.  Coming up next the bureaucracy of disability and long-term disability claims.

						   My mother, God Bless her, is a wonderful woman. However there is one aspect of her personality that I had never quite understood until just recently. I rarely if ever have heard her say I love you.  Without question through out our lives she has shown us in every conceivable manner that she loves us. No matter the crisis she has always been there for my brother, sister and I. From broken down cars to letting us each move back home at least once. From helping us with the down payment on our first homes to bailing us out of every conceivable type of financial difficulty, no matter the problem she has been the sheltering port in each and every storm that we have faced.  This past weekend I was going through some of my grandmother's old papers looking for information that would help me with the family's genealogy. While doing so I came across a bundle of letters that my grandmother and grandfather had exchanged over a one month period in 1951 when she was visiting her family in Washington D.C.  Reading through the letters provided me with a remarkable window onto the past. What the kids (my mother and her brothers) were like. Names of relatives I have never met.  Even what travel was like for people in the late forties and early fifties.  Most importantly though in reading them I began to understand where my mothers difficulty with affection came from.  The letters my grandparents exchanged could have been mistaken for correspondence between casual friends. Nowhere in 99% of the letters would the reader have a clue to their relationship. Only in one letter does my grandfather say that he misses or loves my grandmother. She however does not mention love at all. Overall the writing was without emotion and very sterile.  After reading them I called my mother to tell her what I had found. I figured she would get a kick out of some of the stories mentioned within.  Once we finished reminiscing I off handedly mentioned that I was beginning to understand why she never said I love you or ever showed much affection.  She was briefly taken aback and in a very defensive manner explained that she showed us that she loved us all the time through her action.  I laughed and told her that her love for us was never in doubt it was just that I had always wondered why the words made her uncomfortable. I went on to explain about how impersonal I found her parents letters be.  Once she understood where I was coming from she explained that her parents especially her mother never said I love you and were never big on hugging and kissing. She said that her and her brothers were all the same when it came to emotions, that they all had a very hard time-sharing them.  Before hanging up I ensured her that we all knew that she loved us and that she was and continues to be a mother to be proud of.
