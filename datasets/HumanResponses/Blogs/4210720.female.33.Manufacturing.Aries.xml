						   My co-worker said that there will come a point at which my cravings will go away or at least die down. I think I'm starting to experience it. Normally I snake during the day while working. I usually crave cookies or other carb loaded goodies. Today my only snake was a package of sunflower kernels, (1 carb), for my morning break and nothing but coffee for my afternoon break. I didn't miss the carbs. I have to pat myself on the back for the dinner I made. Broiled chicken, seasoned, marinated and sauteed with onions, served with cabbage. I read somewhere that foods like cabbage and grapefruit help you lose weight. Another thing I'm working on is getting to be earlier. I find that the longer I stay awake at night, I tend to snack.

						   Tonight I had dinner at a restaurant for the first time since starting the Atkins diet again. The fact that this particular has  the best best garlic cheese bread didn't help matters. It was sooooooooo hard. But I was a good girl.  I ignored the warm soft bread and filled up on a green leafy Romain salad.   The salad was no substitute, but at least I have no guilt.  For lunch:   I had an In N Out burger (protein style), and a diet coke. At the restaurant I had an 8 oz steak with veggies and shrimp. No Carbs......  I MISS BREAD.....Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread Bread

						   I've been on a diet  since I was 14 . Back then, the Cambridge diet was all the rave. Though I weighed about 125 lbs at the time, my body type and stature made me appear larger than I was. Not to mention, I begin to develop fast wearing a "C" cup by junior high.   I think I have truly been on every diet;  Cambridge, (liquid), diet at 14, Weight Watchers at 15 and on/off throughout my life for a total of 6 times; SeaGo, (liquid diet in the 80's); Slimfast; Jenny Craig, (diet pills and prepackaged food), Lindora, Nutrisystem, (early 90's); Atkins, SouthBeach, and a slew of other off-brand pills, teas and drinks.  So far,  the only one that ever showed results was Atkins . Three years ago when I tried it, I lost 38lbs. However, I gained back 50lbs. I think I simply ran out of food. There are only so many ways to prepare chicken. Back then people thought I was nuts with the low carb business. There were no low carb menus, wraps or alternatives. Now that everyone else has jumped on the low carb band-wagon, It should be much easier for me to stick to this lifestyle.  So I'm doing it again, this time I will journal my eating habits, physical activity, etc. A friend suggested I blog my Atkins diet experience. Here goes......    The Induction / 1st two weeks  For the next 2 weeks I can have no more than 20 grams of Carbs a day. Today I blew it. Where I usually blow it is at lunch. Today I had 6pc hot wings at KFC and a medium diet coke. I know that the breading on the hot wings went well beyond my daily allotted carb grams. I guess this means that I;m back at point A. I did really well at dinner having the Honey mustard salad at Quiznos. It's only 8grams.I walked on the treadmill, uphill, for 25 minutes then rode the stationary bike for 10 more minutes.Tomorrow will be a better day.   Today:  8/12/04 weight: 230lbs, height: 5'4, Goal: 135
