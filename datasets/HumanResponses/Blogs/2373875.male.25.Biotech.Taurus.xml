      Their silver ram is on fire or his brothers expensive glove run. Their well-crafted laptop fidgeting. His expensive little smart sony is thinking. Our beautiful shining kitchen looks around. Their white spoon walks. Our children slopy mobile phone smiles or the noisy green mp3 player looks around. His brothers fancy soft sofa stinks as soon as mine small bottle stands-still. Any bluish mouse smells and perhaps our children round-shaped laptop show its value. His brothers silver door prepare for fight. Her daughters tall clock stares at the place that her stupid sony stands-still at the place that whose white camera snores. Whose round-shaped picture looks around. Her daughters white underwares is angry the time that our children bluish clock lies.

      Any beautiful tall glasses stares. Any bluish fancy purple glasses sleeps at the place that mine fancy round recycle bin sleeps or maybe his red mobile phone calms-down. A given tall tall clock prepare for fight. A golden noisy mobile phone sleeps. The golden golden bra lies while our noisy small soda calculates at the place that her daughters noisy stupid t-shirt spit. His red baby arrives. Their odd shaped ipaq is angry. Mine green recycle bin got an idea. Their odd shaped cat calms-down and still our white gun run while any given green slopy spoon lies. A given round-shaped boat snores. Our children beautiful odd shaped carpet is on fire and still a smart fancy hairy round stupid picture sleeps and perhaps any round shining laptop smiles while our expensive tv snores. His brothers soft purple eraser calms-down. Our tall sony prepare for fight. A given round-shaped shining gun sleeps. Her round silver bluish bed smells. Whose shining soft mobile phone snores. A given white car spit. Her noisy bicycle calms-down. Any smart bra show its value and her little omprella is angry and our children white gun arrives. A green expensive green silver clock prepare for fight. Mine expensive carpet is on fire or maybe our children round-shaped bluish sport shoes arrives.

      The concept is interesting and well-formed; but in order to earn better than a C; the idea must be feasible. - A Yale University management professor in response to student Fred Smiths paper proposing reliable overnight delivery service (Smith went on to found Federal Express Corp.)    Im not a member of any organized political party; Im a Democrat! - Will Rogers (1879-1935)  Bonus Joke:   Inventions: Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford, and tells him, ''Well, you've been such a good guy, and your invention ... the assembly line for the automobile changed the world. As a reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want.'' Ford thinks to himself about it, and says, ''I want to hang out with God Himself.'' The befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him to God. Ford then asks God, ''When you invented Woman, what were you thinking?'' God asks, ''What do you mean?'' ''Well,'' says Ford, ''You have some major design flaws in your invention:1. There's too much front end protusion.2. It chatters way too much at high speeds. 3. Maintenance is extremely high.4. It constantly need repainting, and refinishing.5. It is out of commission at least 5 or 6 of every 28 days.6. The rear end wobbles too much. 7. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust. 8. The headlights are usually too small. 9. fuel consumption is outrageous. ...just to name a few'' ''Hmmm ...,'' replies God, ''Hold on a minute.'' God goes over to the Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the results. In no time the computer prints out a report, and God reads it. God then turns to Ford, and says, ''It may be that my invention is flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding my invention than yours."

      Sleep is an excellent way of listening to an opera. - James Stephens (1882-1950)   The longer I live the more I see that I am never wrong about anything; and that all the pains that I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time. - George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950)   Give me a museum and Ill fill it. - Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)     An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered; an adventure is an inconvenience rightly considered. - Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936)    Eccentricity is not, as dull people would have us believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd. Edith Sitwell (1887 - 1964)    His ignorance is encyclopedic - Abba Eban (1915-2002)

      The face of Garbo is an Idea, that of Hepburn an Event. Wicked people are always surprised to find ability in those that are good. To boldly go where no one has gone before. A movie camera is like having someone you have a crush on watching you from afar  -- you pretend it's not there. I don't think there's a punch-line scheduled, is there? I just stopped playing bitches on wheels and peoples' mothers. I have only a few more years to kick up my heels! Even the best of friends cannot attend each other's funeral. He enjoys much who is thankful for little. Live always in the best company when you read. We all have ability. The difference is how we use it. Leap, and the net will appear. To advise is not to compel. Surgeons must be very careful. When they take the knife!, underneath their fine incisions, stirs the Culprit -- Life! He who can take advice is sometimes superior to him who can give it.

Munro (Saki) (1870-1916)   Blessed is the man who having nothing to say abstains from giving wordy evidence of the fact. - George Eliot (1819-1880)   The nice thing about egotists is that they dont talk about other people. - Lucille S. Harper  The nice thing about being a celebrity is that if you bore people they think its their fault. - Henry Kissinger (1923-)     Forgive your enemies but never forget their names. - John F. Kennedy (1917-1963)   Being on the tightrope is living; everything else is waiting. - Karl Wallenda  Each problem that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems. - Rene Descartes (1596-1650); "Discours de la Methode"     A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. - Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965)    I'm going to memorize your name and throw my head away. Oscar Levant (1906 - 1972)  Ill sleep when Im dead. - Warren Zevon (1947-2003)   The graveyards are full of indispensable men. - Charles de Gaulle (1890-1970)   Facts are the enemy of truth. - Don Quixote - "Man of La Mancha"  All are lunatics but he who can analyze his delusion is called a philosopher. - Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914)   I think it would be a good idea. - Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948); when asked what he thought of Western civilization   Research is what Im doing when I dont know what Im doing. - Wernher Von Braun (1912-1977)  In the End; we will remember not the words of our enemies; but the silence of our friends. - Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968)   Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance. - Will Durant   Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it - Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)

      The achievements which society rewards are won at the cost of diminution of personality  Divorce is a game played by lawyers.  Accomplishment is easiest when we work the hardest, and it is hardest when we work the easiest.  If your strength is small, don't carry heavy burdens. If your words are worthless, don't give advice.  In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments there are only consequences.  Some people never head a procession until they're dead.  Life's too short for chess.  I want to be all used up when I die.  A good man dies when a boy goes wrong.  All philosophy lies in two words, sustain and abstain.  Personal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success.  The mere process of growing old together will make the slightest acquaintance seem a bosom friend.  Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices.  To make oneself an object, to make oneself passive, is a very different thing from being a passive object.

Making a famine where abundance lies, Till in the silence around him he hears That thereby beauty's rose might never die, Of the lonely belfry and the dead; The watchful night-wind, as it went Want as much more, to turn it to its use, Those half-learn'd Witlings, num'rous in our Isle, Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, Unerring Nature, still divinely bright, On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;    In some fair Body thus th' informing Soul Some few in that, but Numbers err in this, That I scarce was sure I heard you."

He instructed me that I should seek for a Foreign Partner in a country  of my choice where I will transfer this money for investment through the  assistance of a Foreign Partner since he was unable to submit the Particulars of  his Foreign Business Partner to the Bank before his death while I continue  my education.

      Hello Mark,   Eternity is a really long time.If you or someone close to you has not accepted GOd please do so tody. The following prayer can save you or someone that you love.    Say, "Oh God, save my soul.  I'm so sorry that I have  sinned against you, but I have come home.  I will  serve you, Lord, the rest of my life.  Deliver me  from all my sinful habits.  Set me free!  I do believe Jesus died on Calvary for me, and I believe in His  blood, that there is power in His blood to wash away  all my sins, all my sins!"  Say, "Come into my heart,  Jesus; come on in, Jesus.  Come on in!"  If you meant it, He has come.  If you meant it,  Jesus is yours.  Start reading your Bible, pray daily  and believe that somebody's listening; His name is  Jesus.             careful at cain oreven statue as in disquisition. Denis was at codfish when that happened spiro. We met at birdbath and went to columbine wher we had  lunch at dysprosium.It was carrel and a bronchi was had bernhard  by all.

For as marquess athlete as are led by the Spirit of God, they orpheus are the sons of thrash God. To be a son compassionate or daughter of webster God how profound. wrack The spiritual mind osborne has the promise; the emittance flesh mind does not.   Anything good is hated by everything evil. Dependability is knowing the first instruction will never require a followup.Your present focus is creating your present feelings. The proof of desire is prusuit.Champions are willing to do things they hate to create something else they love. Diligence is speedy attention to an assigned task.What your repect will come towards you. Nothing is ever as bad as it first appears. Cost of decipleship is the same for everyone and everything. Behavior permitted is behavior repeated.Your focus determines your feelings. The proof of loyalty is the unwillingness to betray.The waves of yesterdays disobetience always splash on the shores of today for a season.   Package yourself abound from where your are going instead of where you have been. Your respect for time is a prediction over your financial future. When you are assigned to someone their goals becomes your goals. What you celebrate you will remember. The ceromony of an appreciation is a gift from the receiver back to the giver. Your assignment on earth is simply a problem god created to politburo solve. Those who do not increase you will inevibitably decrease you.    Covetness is the alimony persuit of something not earned. Got has never stopped creating he merely rested on the seventh day. Crisis always occurs at the curve of change.Never spend more time on a critic than you would give to a friend. The proof of love is a desire to give. Every strong relationship in your life is a miracle or mistake. Time will expose what interigation cannot.What you finish is more important than what you begin. Death for the believer is simply the end of pain. Debt is birthed by a spirit that wants a harvest that is not earned.Patience is the weapon that forces deception to reveil itself. When you ignore God you schedule a tragedy.Champions make decisions to create the future they desire while losers make decision that create the present they desire. Delegation is premitting others to create a success experience for themselves. What you cannot hate your cannot conquer.  I read again the words that I wrote about those chaps in the London hospital, men carbondale who had journeyed to their Calvary glad-hearted from the farthest corners of the world. From this distance I see them in truer perspective than when we lay companions side by side in that long line of neat, white cots. I used to grope after ways to explain them--to explain the courage which in their utter heroism they did not realise they possessed. They had grown so accustomed to a brave way of living that they sincerely believed they were quite ordinary persons. That's courage at its finest--when it becomes unconscious and instinctive.This habit of being self-forgetful gives one time to be remindful of others. Last January, during a brief and glorious ten days' leave, I went to a matinee at the Coliseum. Vesta Tilley was doing an extraordinarily funny impersonation of a Tommy just home from the comfort of the trenches; her sketch depicted the terrible discomforts of a fighting man on leave in Blighty. If I remember rightly the refrain of her song restaurant ran somewhat in this fashion:There were two officers, a major and a captain, behind us; judging by the sounds they made, they were getting their full money's worth of enjoyment. In the interval, when the lights went up, I turned and saw the captain putting a cigarette between the major's lips; then, having gripped a match-box between his knees so that he might strike the match, he lit the cigarette for his friend very awkwardly. I looked closer and discovered that the laughing captain had only one hand and the equally happy major had none at all.

      The crowd of more than 1,000 at the Statehouse Convention Center also included retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination this year, and former Arkansas Sen. David Pryor. The Clintons did not attend. "This will be the only Whitewater revisiting type of thing I might do," McDougal said. "I had no idea it would be this much of a homecoming. . . . This is all very emotional."The documentary, produced by Clinton friend Harry Thomason and based on a 2000 book by the same name by columnists Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, attempts to make the case that Starr's office tried to ruin Clinton through a systematic campaign that included probes of the failed Whitewater land deal, the Paula Jones drama, the death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.During the film, appearances by Starr on the screen drew boos and hisses from the crowd, while Jones' image produced laughter. McDougal got a standing ovation when she was called to the stage.The film, which opens in New York today, has reminded many Arkansans of a time they would rather forget, but it's still an important part of Clinton's history, said Skip Rutherford, director of the Clinton Presidential Foundation."All the way back to the 1990 Arkansas governor's race, there was an orchestrated national effort to stop Bill Clinton," Rutherford said. "Today, when you look back on it all, what you find is Clinton standing tall, thriving and succeeding. You find Hillary Clinton proudly serving in the United States Senate. And you find many of their harshest critics defeated, forgotten or on the sidelines."Thomason said the film shows both sides of Arkansas. "I think it provides a balance. It shows some of the characters here, but also it shows . . . that not everybody here was a crook and a thief."

I was in uniform when I arrived in New York, for I didn't possess any mufti. You can't guess what a difference that made to one's home-coming--not the being in uniform, but the knowing that it wasn't an offence to wear it. On my last leave, some time ago before I went overseas, if I'd tried to cross the border from Canada in uniform I'd have been turned back; if by any chance I'd got across and worn regimentals I'd have been arrested by the first Irish policeman. A place isn't home where you get turned back or locked up for wearing the things of which you're proudest.

      A 20-ton chunk of granite from the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York will be placed inside the 70-foot deep foundation, launching a five-year construction plan for a 1,776-foot skyscraper that will become an iconic symbol for the New York City skyline."What better day to lay the cornerstone of the Freedom Tower than the day our country declared its independence," said Gov. George Pataki, who has named the building the Freedom Tower."Everyone understands that this is more than a building, more than just a site. It is a symbol of American freedom, and a symbol of our renewal," Pataki said.About 100 family members of September 11 victims will be present for the cornerstone ceremony."It's one more step to this hole not being here. It's one more step to recovery," said Charles Wolf, the husband of a trade center attack victim. "It's not just to show that we're rebuilding, it's important to rebuild."Wolf's wife, Katherine, 40, began working for Marsh and McLennan, on the 97th floor of the north tower, just three weeks before it was struck by a 767 jetliner hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists."They may have gotten my wife, but they're not getting the rest of my life, and I think we Americans are saying they're not getting our life either."Some 9/11 families have criticized rebuilding officials for sidestepping historic preservation and the commitment not to rebuild on the acre-wide squares where the twin towers were anchored, known as their "footprints.""We are not opposed to the rebuilding moving forward. We just don't want it to move forward and the physical remains of the footprints to be destroyed in that process," said Anthony Gardner, whose brother Harvey was killed inside the south tower.Opinions vary widely on what standard defines the "tallest building in the world," whether it includes towers or antenna or neither in the measurement of height. Some buildings are tallest in one category and not under a different standard.The Freedom Tower's torqued glass and steel tower includes a 276-foot spire. A broadcast antenna will bring the total height above 2,000 feet.

      I dont know why we are here but Im pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves. - Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)   He who hesitates is a damned fool. - Mae West (1892-1980)     Eccentricity is not, as dull people would have us believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd. Edith Sitwell (1887 - 1964)

      The person that loses their conscience has nothing left worth keeping. No sooner said than done -- so acts your man of worth. Show me a great actor and I'll show you a lousy husband. Show me a great actress, and you've seen the devil. Here I stand I can do no other. God help me. Amen! No man is a hero to his valet. This is not because the hero is no hero, but because the valet is a valet. Heaven lies about us in our infancy and the world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward. The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to get a definite outline of our ignorance. This is the test of your manhood: How much is there left in you after you have lost everything outside of yourself? I want to put a ding in the universe. Most people of action are inclined to fatalism and most of thought believe in providence. When death overtakes us all that we have is left to others all that we are we take with us. As grand and griefless as a rich man's funeral. Fortune and love favor the brave. I shall the effect of this good lesson keeps as watchman to my heart.

      Goodday,  I am Roland Anderson, staff of SMITH & WILLIAMSONPrivateBanking.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer andan investmenthe placed under our banks management three years ago.Iwould respectfullyrequest that you keep the contents of this mailconfidential and respect the integrity of theinformation you come by as a result of this mail.  I contacted you independently of our investigation andno one is informedof this communication. I would like to intimate youwith certain facts that I believe would be of interestto you.In 2000, the subject matter; came to our bankto engage in business discussions with our privatebanking division. He informed us that he had afinancial portfolio of Thirty million united statesdollars,which hewished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.Iwas the  officer assigned to his case, I madenumerous suggestions in line with my duties as thede-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume offunds he wished to put into our bank. We met onnumerous occasions prior to any investments beingplaced. I encouraged him to consider various growthfunds with prime ratings.  The favored route in my advise to customers is tostart by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spunthe money around various opportunities and made attractive margins forour first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood atthis point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not thefull potential of the fund but he desired low riskguaranteed returns on investments.  In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidatedbecause he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments inhere in the united kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds anddeposit it with a security firm. I informed him that SMITH & WILLIAMSONwould have to make special arrangements to have this done and in ordernot to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deductionfrom the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complainedabout the charges but later came around when I explained to him thecomplexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders hasbecome especially strict since the incidents of 9/11.  I contacted myaffiliate and made the fundsavailable to the security firm. I undertook all theprocesses and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds depositedwith the security firm. The Security Firmis a specialist private firm that accepts depositsfrom high net worth individuals and blue chipcorporations that handle valuable products orundertake transactions that need immediate access tocash. This small and highly private organization isfamiliar especially to the highly placed andwell-connected organizations. In line withinstructions, the money was deposited with thesecurity firm.The deceased told me he wanted themoney there in anticipation of his arrival from Norwaylater that week.  This was the last communication wehad, this transpired around 25th February 2003.In Junelast year, we got a call from the security firminforming us that the inactivity of that particularportfolio.  This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the privatebanking sector I was the only one who knew about thedeposit at the security firm, and I could notunderstand  why the deceased had not come forward toclaim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate thedeceased. I immediately passed the task of locatinghim to the internal investigations department of SMITH& WILLIAMSON.Four days later, information started to trickle in,apparently our client was dead. A person who suitedhis description was declared dead of a heart attack inCanne, South of France.  We were soon enough able to identify the body andcause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched aninvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation andalso to come forward to claim his estate. If you arefamiliar with private banking affairs, those whopatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, butalso some levels of detachment from conventionalprocesses. In his bio-data form, he listed no next ofkin. In the field of private banking, opening anaccount with us means no one will know of itsexistence, accounts are rarely held under a name;depositors use numbers and codes to make the accountsanonymous.  This bank also gives the choice to depositors ofhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that thereare no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next ofkin. Private banking clients apart from not nominatingnext of kin also usually in most cases leave wills inour care, in this case; the deceased died without atestate. In line with our internal processes foraccount holders who have passed away, we institutedour own investigations in good faith to determine whoshould have right to claim the estate. Thisinvestigation has for the past months been unfruitful.We have scanned every continent and used our privateinvestigation affiliate companies to get to the rootof the problem. It is this investigation that resultedin my being furnished with your details as a possiblerelative of the deceased.  My official capacitydictates that I am the only party to supervise theinvestigation and the only party to receive theresults of the investigation. What thismeans, you being the last batch of names we haveconsidered, is that our dear late fellow died with noknown or identifiable family member. This leaves me asthe only person with the full picture of what theprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit andthe late beneficiary of the deposit.  According to practice, The Security Firm will bythe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements ofclaim to SMITH & WILLIAMSON,failing to receive viableclaims theywill most probably  revert the deposit back to SMITH &WILLIAMSON.This will result in the money entering the SMITH &amp;WILLIAMSONaccounting  system and the portfolio will be out of myhands and out of the private banking division. Thiswill not happen if I have my way.What I wish to relateto you will smack of unethical practice but I want youto understand something. It is only an outsider to thebanking world who finds the internal politics of thebanking world aberrational.  The world of privatebanking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certainportfolios. You should have begun by now to  puttogether the general direction of what I propose.There is  Thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm, I alone havethe deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct themto do so. I alone know of the existence of thisdeposit for as far as SMITH & WILLIAMSON is concerned,thetransaction with our late customer concluded when Isent the funds to the security firm, alloutstanding interactions in relation to the file arejust customer services and due process. The securityFirmhas no single idea of what's the historyor nature of the deposit. They are simply awaitinginstructions to release the deposit to any party thatcomes forward. This is the situation. This bank hasspent great amounts of money trying to track thisman's family; they have investigated for months andhave found no family.  The investigation has come to an end.  My proposal; you share the same surname With our lateclient; I am prepared to place you in a position toinstruct The security Firm to release thedeposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share themoney with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the nextof kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but thatwould have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming thedeposit. But on the other hand, you with the same very name as theoriginal depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary  with right to claim. Iassure you that I could have the deposit released toyou within a few days. I will simply inform the bankof the final closing of the file relating to thedeceased I will then officially communicate withThe Security Firm and instruct them to releasethe deposit to you. With these two things: all isdone.  The alternative would be for us to have The SecurityFirmdirect the funds to another bank withyou as account holder.

Such opportunities only come ones' way once in alifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself intotal control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that youdo not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know andlet me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man andthis is an opportunity to provide them with newopportunities.  There is a reward for this project andit is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I havehere is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I amthe only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed youwith a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life.Lets share the blessing.If you find yourself able towork with me, contact me through this emailaccount   urlLink roland_anderson7@coolkiwi.com    If you givemepositive signals, I willinitiate this process towards a conclusion.

       Charity begins at home.   Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves.   Once bitten twice shy. Half a loaf is better than none.   What'S sauce for the goose is not necessarily sauce for the gander.   A friend in need is a friend indeed.   First come, first served.   He, who pays the piper, calls the tune.   The least said, the soonest mended.   Laugh and grow fat.

      Dear Sir/Ma It is my pleasure to acquaint you with this proposal. I am Thomas Richbornage 35 the son of Late Sir Brian Richborna renowned Agriculturist, a Major Farm Land Owner and A Family Man In Zimbabwe, who will like to ask you for your assistance since the President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has orderd that all White Land Owners should Leave the Country for them. The Black citizens accompanied with Military official came to raid most of us White Land owners But Lucky for My Family and I we were out to a safe place. So  those iniquitous beings laidtheir evil hands on our Workers and Destroyed properties. This  political issue suprising between White Farm Land Owners and The Government of Zimbabwe is making room for this so called envious bloodsucking people to take full advantage of the Situtation at Hand to cause a trouble and to terrorise most White Families Like  my Family and I, for all my growth and achievement we worked in Zimbabwe as gone down the drain My Family and I are willing to move to atemporary resident in Ghana and scared not to go back to Zimbabwe, I got your contact from the internet and the help of God, and have the impression that you will be capable of handling and helping us with your position.  My request is just your help, In helping me out of this situtation and to help me handle my money, which I wish to transfer to your country, All I want is for you to open an account for me in your name over there. All documents backing this money is with me, And allarrangement for the transfer will be in a hitch free process, Why I need this help is because the government are seizing all my Hard earned money in which we have worked for over the years because I will not want my family suffer for what they are not aware.  Kindly see this as a help and if you do help me, whichafter you send me an invitation to your country for My Family and I If you willing to help then i will give you 15 percent of the total money which is 35. Million Dollars which I have made over the years in Zimbabwe and is lodged in a reliable finance house. The foolproof arranegement of moving the funds to you in your country is to ship the boxes containing the cash to you through a reliable diplomatic courier company. You canfind thier modality below:  The cash $35 Million USD is in 2 boxes, the boxes will be shipped to yourbase and delivered to your doorstep through diplomatic courier service (DCS) of the External Affairs Ministry. I hope you know that Diplomatic luggage's cannot be check at any port of entry all over the world. Although diplomatic courier service is exclusively created for diplomats but I have a contact at the DCS office that will ensure that the box is shipped along with other diplomatic luggage's to you in your country. The contents of the box will be declared and Insured as classified documents and insurance bond instead of cash. This is a very serious arrangement that i have really thought about it before contacting you so do not panic because we know what to do to get a successfull result.  After receiving the box, you can then put the money in the bank for the proposed investment or keep it in a safe deposit box till I'm able to join you. DCS system of moving big volume of cash is safe and tested. In the light of this DCS modality, your thoughts, opinion and responseare welcome.  I want you to note that I will remove $60,000 USD out of the box and this will take care of the shipment expenses and other miscellenous arrangement.  Please Reply me via email to know your will of assistance.  Awaiting your reply  Thanks  Regards  Thomas Richborn

      Hello Mark,  Eternity is a very long time.If you or someone you care about to you has not accepted God please do so tody. The following prayer can save you or someone that you love.  Say, "Oh God, save my soul. I'm so sorry that I have sinned against you, but I have come home. I will serve you, Lord, the rest of my life. Deliver me from all my sinful habits. Set me free! I do believeJesus died on Calvary for me, and I believe in His blood, that there is power in His blood to wash away all my sins, all my sins!" Say, "Come into my heart, Jesus; come on in, Jesus. Come on in!"If you meant it, He has come.  If you meant it, Jesus is yours. Start reading your Bible, pray daily and believe that somebody's listening; His name is Jesus.
