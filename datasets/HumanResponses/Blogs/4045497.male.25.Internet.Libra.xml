						    The training should have been today!!  Going yesterday was a mistake, end up bowling myself, hahaha for 2 hrs straight. Quite good though, as i managed to pick up some new things during that time. One of the first few times, i tried bowling without a hand guard/ glove.  Again, customers call to make changes etc to websites as usual. Managed to fix one customers' issues, and now have some free time to do some typing. Still yet to eat, ...wondering what to have for lunch?   Maybe go out to eat? or making cook something for myself?  A ex-colleague called me to collect cheque etc.   Guess i have to write out a cheque soon today, for his outstanding stuff.

						    Finally settled most of my customers' stuff. Got a email from my team mate, from my bowling team, eliteebowlers.com.  They are having a adhoc session today at 4pm. Its cheaper, and less people bowling during office hours. Since my time is quite flexible, decided to join them shortly.  need to practise after my dismal performance on Mon. Got to train hard so that my aim of winning a tournament can   be achieved soon, hahaha.  So far, my best finish in a tournament is 9th. Will be training in Yishun Safra from 4-6pm. Maybe have to try playing a different style etc. Or bringing    another ball etc. Dun feel good, when i am not playing my best recently.  Will post more stuff again tomorrow then.

						   Today,   woke up, partly because of noise in the living room. My brother, who is inconsiderate to bring a group of friends for a mahjong session, and this group is really noisy, causing me sleeplessness yesterday night.  Now feel lethargic and angry. Smsed him earlier to ask his friends to keep quiet. I got to talk to my brother today, to let him know, the problems.  Might have to go to office just to FAX a letter to someone to terminate my office ADSL line. Shifting office in mid Aug, so have to do the necessary  ground work soon....  Ok, back to work for now.

						    Created my first blog, partly because someone is asking me to teach    her how to upload her picture on the blog!   But anyway, its a great start in the morning to be helping someone    though. Woken up today already by&nbsp;1 customer to update    their website, and another to help fix a problem.   Woke up late today, partly due to yesterday bowling league game.  Bowled my worst game to date! Was just having 3 handicap, which    means I normally have at least 187 per game! Yesterday a total flop!  scoring at most 160 avg. Disappointing night..hahaha.   Guess today will have to do a fair bit of work. Perhaps might    drop by office to settle some bills..later..though, as still    have to do some work..arghhhhhhh &nbsp;

						    Woke up early today. Started off attending to some clients at home.  Had to get ready to go office to do accounts today, and also fax some documents.   So had lunch earlier today, at 12noon, one of the few times i done so for the past month.     Had some good news last sat, is that one customer emailed me to tell me i have been awarded their project. Cool, but that also means it will be a busy month for me ahead.  There is my office shift on top of these projects.    Looks like its work and work for the next few weeks.    But at least at the end of the month, there is some light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps $$$ too, hahahaha.  After work today, had to go to Planet Bowl(its at civil service club, not a planet) to watch my team in action(2nd in the league) against the top team. We lost to them today, so we finished 2nd in round 1..hopefully we will beat them in round 2.  Got home, still have to get ready the CD, and a document for tomorrow early meeting at 9.30am! And now I am on this site typing ? I should be sleeping by now, have to wake up at 7 tomorrow, its been ages since I done that, hahahaha.  Ok then, wish me luck for tomorrow!
