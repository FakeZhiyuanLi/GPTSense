         Lets start with my parents wedding.My mom was fooling herself, she married my dad just to marry him.She thought she had to marry,she did have 7 sisters that were marrying or already married.She was the youngest..Than again you cant blame my mom,she never really remembered a true marraige.Her mother died when she was real young, And her farther re-married an evil bitch..Who was worse than the stepmother in cinderella.Unfortanly for my mom she didnt get a ever-after happy ending like cinderella.        She and my dad married,last for seven years.I was about 5 almost 6,When they divorced..I remember,sad really.I have issues remembering thangs,but I remember this. I was the one who sugested them getting divorced.What was I thinking? You try being 6 year old,the kid at school everyone picks on,yet The trouble-maker..And have to go home to parents fighting,throwing stuff,and hardly ever seeing your mom,and your farther forgetting your alive.      Well they got divorced by the time I started 1st grade..By the time I was about to begin 3rd grade.I lost my grandma*to my mom,the only one Alive that I had..my stepgrandma dont count as the family, mom got real issues with her.* And my grandma and my aunt were kinda like my reall close family.My aunt is still alive,and she's cool, But she lives out of state.      Well as the years went by..My dad kinda got in trouble, drank, and had anger issues everyonce in awhile..Lost his house..We moved into an apartment for cheaper than normal.Wasnt bad either, he got a specail deal to..Met some friends, infact two of my best friends now.Well one, we're kinda distant,but we still talk..She's real nice..The other she's fun and cool,but I bit to sarcastic at times..Even when she's joking you cant help but take some thangs personal.Not I,but others.Heh I've learned to ignore or sarcastic commements..      By then My dad and I we're cool,I was playing soccer..Being the son he never had,and I was taking care of the son He did have..My little brother isnt an atheltic or smart kinda boy..IM the one who has to do so well in sports,and grades.I dont mind it,Gives me something to do,and at least that way My dad knows who I am.      My dad was done with some of the bad shit he was into and etc..But than he lost alot of money..Lost the apartment..Lived with his brother,my uncle who's really sick..Infact he got better,but is sick again..Poor uncle mo.      Well My dad and bob,both getting reall down on money wise..looked,got a house togethere, got new jobs that pay alright enuff..And are living togethere..Now bob is disguesting! He smokes, drinks,parties, and is a pervert..But he's not that bad of a guy, and he's my dads best friend...THe bad thang bout this is, my dad is drinking again, gambling..We still keep in touch some.Oh by the way,Im living with my mom now.And she's stressing alot over who knows what..      As thangs started to seem good,they went downhill..Funny eh? well once your down thiers only one way to go, back up..So Im not gonna get depressed bout this, But sometimes It kinda gets overwhelming..      anywho thats the background..and now we're to the future. Me living with my mom,who's become an over-stress, raging mom..who's drinking occasionally to.. To me starting at a new school,with my old friends, but funny thang is, I only have a couple classes with my old friends.Time for new friends,and a new beginging..I just gotta tie up loose ends..      Oh I know its not the smartest thang to do, nor the safest..But I've met some friends online, from a distances..Jason, he's a great friend..and My new boyfriend Joey.      But the problem is I have a best friend thats a guy,down here..Who can be such a temptation at times,and he wont shut up..always liking someone else, and yet likes me but will never go back out with me..and Im not sure,but I just cant let go of him..Which is an issue..and I dont know if being such close friends with him will work out..so I think Im gonna try and push him away..      I started to,but he resisted..Argh..How annoying..But Nonetheless..if I want my new bf joey to work and to be honost and true with him..I need to stop holding onto Dan.         Okay Now that you know whats going on,and up-to date,and now a basic review of my past..We can talk some real shit,But Im not in the mood right now..one of my best friends*a chick one* signed on msn..SO IM OFF to chat. Toodles! heh..That is just a funny word to me..I like it dunno why..TOodles!
