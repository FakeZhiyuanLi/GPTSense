      I realized that I sometimes avoid situations the way I avoided holding my daughters hand during the past weeks. She would grab hold of my hand, I would find a way to fanagle not having my hand there while at the same time not freaking her out by mentioning about The Bugs.   First, it started like an allergic reaction to soap or something, maybe some sort of enigmatic hives...it itched and caused her some distress, not to mention the skin was peeling away from between her fingers. Ew. Athlete's Finger, par chance?  Too many cartwheels on the grass? Chemlawn? Eh? Dunno...  It is odd to think of Tiny Whos from Whoville actually LIVING inside the skin of someone you love, though, as we all know there are a myriad of itsy bitsy humanoid-lovin' parasites out there. Just. Well. You don't usually have to wash all of the clothing, linens and pillows in your abode to avoid terrible itching.   Crabs. In fact. What a hell of a name. Crabs. Scabies. Ick of the subcutaneous variety. Makes one think of the Ganges, or of fly ridden bellies in Bangladesh. But, it is, in fact, a phenomenon that knows no class, no gender, and certainly picks unwilling participants without their knowledge.  By the time you itch, it is too late.  Love is sorta like that, too, I guess. Funny, I don't try to avoid *that* so very much.

      I thought the gills were coming. I could feel them growing on the side of my head, and the word "cubit" kept circling round my cranium in a low and undeniable hiss. Too many, far too many, days without sun...Boston lingered on the verge of distinction, the dinosaurs laughing in their long forgotten graves and tar pits, laughing at us mere humans who skitter about like ants looking for the Best Deal, for the Most Fastest, and for the Less Carbs.  I seem to have forgotten how intense and hurtful the light is to my retinas. Ow. And the sound of the rustling leaves doing their chlorophillic  dance in the breeze is loud, as loud as was the rain, but a deeper and wavy sound that rushes about in distances and different forces. Forces to be reckoned with.  So this is the beginning. Or, erm, bloggining...

      It wasn't that long a trip. Just from Boston to the Berserkshires. But I always have an enormously absurd time on the road with my favorite driving companion. He is a Sparkmonkey, too. Maybe moreso than me, onaccounta he is also part Magpie, which means not only is he wired to process at warp speed in many directions at once, but he is also apparently adventure oriented and pushes boundaries like no one elses business, but I digress...he finds cool things to do, or say, or be.  "So, did I *ever* tell you about what I used to do with hotdogs when I was a kid?"  Now, that, my friends, coming from him, is, well, it is a frightening thing.  Mind in the gutter I shuddered to think aloud what glorious gifts to the Altar of Hotdog were given. And, knowing him as I do, my snicker wiggled out of my tightly pursed-for-safety-sake lips.  "Do I want to hear the answer to that question?" my response snickered at me from behind a huge smile. He was driving and couldn't really see how funny this really was. I mean, for me it is nearley juice-snorting-out-yer-nose silly.  "See, my family wasn't a chip family. No. They were a Stick family, so I took the potato stix and shoved them into the hot dog and then ate em."  Okay, so I am thinking...Ow..catheter thoughts are careening through my mind while at the same time laughter was pulling through my chest and rolling out my mouth. Sick funny things are like that, sometimes. Sorta like graveside laughter.  Then, I gots to thinking:  So did he stick em on the outside, too? You know, so it looked like a porcupine? I asked.  He answered, and I do not remember what he said, cause a beautiful deer crossed the road in front of us, bounding away into everpresent greenery on the bumpy back road to Camp High Rock.  "Damned Doe Eyed Children of Satan!!! How dare they cross the road in front of us!!!"  But it really was cute.  No. Really it was.

      My life is going to change. School will be out for the summer. I remember the way this day used to feel, as a child. It felt like the Mother of All Fridays. Endless possibility burgeoning at the outlines of capability. Pools. Ponds. Beaches. Naps. Graham crackers. Fluffnutters. Older, then...Gin and Tonics on the porch with dad, playing backgammon...tanning by Buzzards Bay.  Now, it means the end of my alone time. I am the cruise director for the summer. And the therapist, cook, maid, bank, taxi and tutor. Yipes. That sucks baby wipes. Okay, not all of it. But it *is* daunting. Especially with little money. Perhaps we should play Little House on the Prairie for the summer. Wear gingham dresses and play with gourds and corn husk dolls. Oh. That would work ever-so-well with the teenager. Ah. No. Unless said corn husk doll listens to hip-hop and can help the teeny straighten the back of her hair. And go to the store and buy her some new razors, you know the kind-with-the-soap already attached? (Fuck Jewel, it was a stupid song anyway. Intuition, my ass!)  I have spent the past few days in a flurry of creative efforts. Making wonderful cards for Pan and Skydancer, doing Paintshop Pro work, photography and a sortza other things. I felt the rotating door starting to make smaller the window of opportunity for such luxuries.  Still, I intend to set apart time each day for myself, a little anyway. And the girls have reading time, every. day. So. Help. Me. Gawd.  9:47...now less than 120 minutes away.  The heart quickens, the breath comes faster. The End Is Near.

      This is the way it is today:  I am wearing some really old and baggy cargo shorts I found last summer. They are soft and big and wey-cool. And my Woolrich socks, green, with hiking shoes. And I am jazzed on some really good MochaLatte which bathes this New England Early Summer day in a brilliant zig zaggy light.  And I am glad to be me. Today. There is a vibrancy to the world outside, a certain just-behind-the-visual buzzing. The sky is cerulean and the wind caresses just-right, also just-behind-the-visual. The muses of creativity are pawing at my inner artiste, meowling for attention. Feed Me. Pet Me. Play with me. It is a constant tinitus of the soul.  Ring On.

      My teen daughter came out of the kitchen this morning holding teaspoons under her eyes. It looked really funny. I asked what she was doing and she told me that "..it helps the sleepybags under yer eyes".  As we were watching TV this morning, all about Reagan's farwellpalooza, I mentioned that this was a man who sold arms to Sadaam Hussein. Her, serious, reply:  "HUMAN arms??!!!" I explained to her that arms meant weapons...  And then, when the announcer mentioned something about Ronald Reagan's period at the White House, she said:  "His PERIOD????????WTF?"  Not so silly:  Billy Bumperfixer says my Toyota ain't worth fixin. Boo. Hiss. So I am buying Skydancers Mazda for 600.00 on Tuesday just before they leave for California. I could not rent a car for the summer for that much, and I know it will get me through until Fall, at the least. By then I will have a better handle on what my financial status will be, what with school and all.  Getting ready, joyously!, for Earth Drum Council Weekend. My air mattress met with a kitty claw this winter and I am now trying (somewhat in vain) to patch. Grrmmm. If I had a car I would go get another mattress, but, alas, the burro she is rigid in death.  I am thinking of showing my portfolio:(http://hometown.aol.com/firespiral/myhomepage/artgallery.html)to the the Starbux in Andover. They have a rotating gallery there, and I think it would be WheyKewl to have my work up on a wall somewhere so the java-zippy uppercrusties can peruse my pixels, and maybe even find their wallet itching a little.  Who knows? The Shadow knows!

      It was the longest three seconds I have lived through in many years. Rain-slicked road. Cars stopping short. Me, wheels locked in brake, sliding, slowly...one...two...three...BAM!  As you can see from the last photoblog, my Toyota needs some dental work. Lots of it. Maybe too much of it, I dunno. Billy Bumperfixer shall take a gander at it next week.   This morning I woke up in a mild to moderate panic, anxiety attack on the horizon (not unusual for me sometimes) and yet tired at the same time. I thought about that steaming cup-o-joe that was waiting for my Benevolent Maker Ability. And I thought about that Buspar (anxiolytic) tablet, waiting for me patiently in the yellow bottle in my cabinet.  Then I thought about uppers and downers.  Then I thought about Benny and the Jets. Onaccounta Benny sounds like benzodiazapines, and Jets, well, coffee, d'oh. Made me giggle.  I am poor, but I am alive. Coffee is a good thing. And Buspar rox the igloo as far as I am concerned.  Note to self: It is gonna be okay, No. Really, it is.

      I wonder sometimes, in awe, at the contra-dance that is the morning drop-off line of cars at the Middle School. Three grades drop off at three different entrances in the back of the school. Two lanes, one rotary, many cars,kids with poster boards, back packs, girls in short skirts in the rain, and moms and dads some just-barely-awake.  People seem to grok the pace and policy most mornings, and it is an intricate web of "You go...no, YOU go's". People are *actually* polite. Go Figure. Now, in Pittsburgh, this would not be an amazing thing. Boston, um, it should be written in the front pages of the Globe:  "North Andover Residents found to be Polite in Early Morning Shuffle."  This morning, as I was do-si-do'ing with an SUV I caught glimpse of a dad-hand holding a commuter mug of coffee, wedding ring glinting in the non-existent morning sun. Wipers swishing back and forth, I found myself in midst of a poignant moment.   Some days I want an SUV life. With a "nice" man, who wears a wedding ring and holds his coffee mug on the way to dropping the kids off at school. He probably made me some coffee and brought it to me before he left in the herd of backpacks and squealing, whining preteens.   My rattling 1989 Toyota Camery bumbles into the lot bearing the bumper stickers that read:  "Well Behaved Women Rarely Make History" and "Carefully disguised as a Responsible Adult"  If it were not for the Hip-Hop station blaring on the radio I doubt my teenager would even allow me to enter the four-block radius. She hates my post-hippy-yet-well-educated-massage-therapist-to-be life. She wants a life more like Dad's, resplendent with grand pianos, fancy cars, trips to Tuscany.  I really don't want the SUV. Just the guy with the coffee cup, someone who is willing to invest in the love of his life as much and as deeply as this man is willing to invest in debt...someone to drive my kids to school, make me coffee.   Maybe the fact that I only have 500 bux in the bank after paying my $1,400 rent is getting to me.  Damn ambition.  Damn it to hell.

      My street becomes a huge pinball game on Tuesdays. Trash day. And the Waste Management Staff is rather cavalier about tossing the referenda when they are done. A slight hill taunts the now less encumbered receptacles to roll. And God help us if there is a wind, stiff or no. I always thought it would be a Good Thing to have Little People, minions (well-paid, of course) follow behind the truck at a good fifty paces. You know. To pick up the Misses. The strewn juice box, the Too Small To Bend Over And Pick Up's.  I don't generally mind playing Dodge the Can. Except when I do. And then, well, it is a pain in the ass the size of which is directly related to whether or not it is MY can rolling down the street or not.

      Someone asked me this weekend if I went to art school. I answered no. Onaccounta I din’t. I guess my talent comes naturally, and has been born of practice and vision and intent. Much less expensive than art school. I wish, sometimes, that I had gone to school for the sole purpose of honing my skill. Some inner censor tells me (in my mothers voice, of course) that I could and would *never* make a living as an artist. Despite the fact that my father attended both Harvard AND Columbia, studying art and business , in that order, he never made money painting.  But, as I sit here, I have a painting he did in Mexico in 1944, a rather nice one, and I think to myself that perhaps one day my own child will want to put some of my art on her wall somewhere.   When I really think about it, my art is more about living than getting. I prefer to be understood and known than rich and famous. I would rather be seen in a gallery than begged to drag my muse out of her sleep to perform for money. Sure, sometimes I have fantasies about being Good Enough to be wanted by some collector, or someone who seeks to surround themselves with beauty and grace and humor and color...Who knows, maybe one day my words will be published somewhere other than here, and my art may adorn the white walls of some studio space or gallery. I will sip some wine, eat some grapes and speak of my motivations with people who ask.  But, for now, I just draw and paint, print and shoot, write and ponder and spew here. Where no one asks me if I went to art school. I do wish more people would stop by here, though. Sometimes I see and hear only my own echo. At least I like the sight and sound of it. And, I pay myself well.

      Often I find myself thinking that I will remember "this" so when it is time to sit down to write "this" will all come back to me. But, more often than not, "this" is evasive at the time of writing. Like a dream upon waking. One that was so vivid in color, feel, incident, that memory surely *must* have inscribed it into the curvy grey matter for all time. Alas, when it comes time to relay the dream so surely captured, it is gone, fluttered away, spent, dissipated on a vaporous miasma of consciousness stretched only wide enough to know it is, indeed, morning, and not much else that came before.  I think to myself, quietly, (so as not to disturb those around me, or to waken them to the notion that I am, in fact, addicted to my muse, my art, my writing, at such depth that I can barely live a moment or three without wanting to jot it down, sketch it out) that I *should* write things down in a teeny notebook. And wear a sign that says: "I am blogging this". Even as I write that, my software has not a clue as to what that word "blog" means, and I know that, as surely as a waking baby during lovemaking, that I ...Will. Have. To. Explain. That. Term. To. Almost. Everyone. And then, of course, assuage their fears that I am not planning on attracting psychopath (though I suspect some may eventually read these words....Um) and that I am not (ahem) being specific about "sensitive" matters involving first names, yadda, yadda, yadda..  I like to believe that I will remember that which was so funny when I was doubled over in the parking lot beseeching my Companion to NOT invoke the Goddess of Tinkle. I am sorely mistaken. What to do? Gingko? Mindfulness meditation? Recording device?  Sometimes, Other Life intervenes. As the popsicle of That Which Is Bloggable is being held by me, dripping, something Else happens. A spill. A phone call. A doorbell. A chore. A stoplight. And, by the time I get back to "it" I have sticky hands and a mess to clean and the sharp details are all derailed and a-muck. I enjoy picking up the pieces and putting them together sometimes. Things can morph, with time, into more interesting fractals of what actually transpired. Creative License and all that.  I suppose I should just make it a practice of writing things down, little phrases to tease my memory back to erection when it is flaccid. But, the devil is in the details. And I like to chase that devil around the block a few times, making him pant for breath as I rip apart the seams of conversations, witty timing, clever metaphors and gooey insinuations. I want them at my fingertips. I want to feel the twill of an instant beneath my fingers. I want to be able to hold onto that moment and be able to recreate a quilt of furiously typed words here as soon as I am able.  My name is Julia. And I am a blogoholic.

      I held a baby this weekend. The familiar baby-sway came back to me readily, as did the football hold which kept me from throwing my child out the window eleven years ago (it was one of the few things that shut her screaming, frothing, qivering cake- hole down for a few Gawdgiven minutes). This baby belongs to my Companions brother and wife. The tiny fingers with pearly nails, the carmel smell of his newly breastfed face, the warmth and weight of his body in my arms did not issue forth the siren song of motherhood. I was ever so grateful to be an aunty, to have and hold for time that is measured in moments or hours. I felt no *ping* in my loins begging me to "try again" That would be futile. I am barren now, snipped years ago.   I looked at the long and emotionally dusty faces of the parents, tired, drained, and totally in love with this new life, and I remembered the vast ocean of time that was the minutes before daddy came home, or the ever-slight hour that was not filled with screaming. It was a mixed blessing, giving life, bringing it forth, nurturing it, feeding it, making it safe. At the cost of doing the same for myself, or my doomed to failure marriage, I am glad I sqandered what I did have to give to my children. They have grown to amazingly viable people.  I feel gratitude that I can be a part of this infants life, watch him grow into being a Big Boy Charlie, make him giggle, soothe him as he needs it when I am there. And I am grateful in equal measure that I can hand him back to the mommy and daddy and wave goodbye and smile saying "See you next time Charlieroo!"

My companion chose a strawberry shortcake shake...with cookies all a whizzed inside. It was an arduous task to make, apparently. We waited a lonnng time. &nbsp; At the point where the , um, blending came to the scene: &nbsp; "Wheeeeeeeeeeeebzzzzzzzzzzzzzwhirrrrrrrrrrrgrinnnnnnnnnnnnd" "Grinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnndgriiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd" "Zzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeegrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd!" &nbsp; My companion turned to me and said: &nbsp; "Um, yeah, I need to floss more"

      What is this puny little world coming to?  I ask you, please. It was enough to see a Mary Kay VW Bug being towed behind a Winnebago the other day (tho' at first glance, before the horror hit me, the thought actually passed my cranium guard bees that, ya know...maybe I could do that. Maybe I *could* handle driving an absurd monument to American Conspicuous Consumption such as Mary Kay Mobiles of Luxury...pink 'n all, if....if...IF it were a new VW Bug, but I digress).  But, to actually market a QUIETER feminine product? Sheesh. Just point me to the nearest menstrual hut and I will wait out the whole messy thing if it is really *that* upsetting to listen to *that* sort of noise...in...in...in a WOMENS ROOM!  Or maybe it is for all the husbands who shrink under the covers at night listening to their Lovies brush their little toofies and then go potty....and then, ew...that noise. Oh, I know that *that* means. It is "Krinkly Wrapper Noise in the Bathroom" time.  Really now. Let's just grow up a bit here. Yes, your teachers, those nuns (remember them???). They went poopie, too. Big Suprise!   And why, oh why, do we need Cooling Sensation Capsules for our NSAID's?  Would it be onaccounta you are too stupid to actually DRINK the full glass of water it takes to buffer those babies down the gullet? Or is it that the beer you chased it with is causing a Mylanta Moment you would rather forget?  God forbid you should Get Your Visitor and Need Tylenol for Cramps at the same time without either of those products. If you suspect that happening to you, stop your flow immediately. You must not go any further without a trip to the pharmacy. Oh, and bring your Extra Care Card so you can get the double coupons if you only buy six of each.

      This morning while snarfing down my espresso I decided to flick on the TV. Eeeegads! A full frontal assault of the John/John Game. Both candidates walking Kennedy-style with family surrounding, swinging the little one (woulda been a bit of a media mess had the tot's arm dislocated, eh?). I thought:  "Man, are we being PLAYED..."  I realize that *something* has to be done. I realize that *someone* else has to take the lead here. I also realize that change is slow and unlikely to be garnered within the framework of any one president's efforts of a term or two, at least at this point. The crap pile is too deep for any administration to clean out the basement and attic of these things.  But, really now.  It was as orchestrated at Cirque de Soleil...Cirque de Poulet is more like it. And for so long the TV went on and on about ages and names and ooh-la-la and all that.  It is going to be a lonnnnnnnnng year.  I think the highlight will be the Olympics...for me, anyway. Though you will see me kiss the ground if Kerry makes it. Really. At least, I *think* he will tread water instead of make this mess even bloodier. I am sad and angry, and, okay, yeah, a little hopeful that this new brood will shore up the timbers of this crumbling entity called "America".

      There is a certain feeling I get. For me, I call it The Proing. It happened today at Buck-A-Book (go ahead, kick me, I am poor) as I was shopping for a birthday gift for a kid I love. It is a hot day. Really. The first really hot one in a while. And, well, then there is that **hormonal** thing to add into the mix. Wet shirt. Mostly looking like a humongous cartoon kiss under my boobs. Such crap. I thought. What yucky little toys. Then it happened:  "PROING!!"  It is the feeling when the front opening bra, (the lavander one that is kinda sheer and sexy, yeah, that one, so...) it decides to be Free! Free the bonds that keep us together, Brother. Proing and be free. So now I am standing there with sweaty shirt and bra that has proing-ed and I wonder. How do I get this back together without appearing a shoplifter?  I gave up.  It was too hot.

       urlLink    He had never heard the term before. The waiter was probably all of 18 or so. He thought we were crazy as we giggled. "Coulotte??!", we said in amazement. "Did he just say we were having pants for dinner?", I asked. "Um, yup, I think so!" was the response from the other side of the table. "I really enjoy beef that yields to the power that is my tongue", I said. Mmmm, it was very tasty. Even with the funny name.&nbsp; urlLink

      I *was* in Vermont. Having the time of my life. Well, okay, not my life, but certainly the best time I have had all summer. Linked arm in arm with my bestest traveling buddy, strolling around Brattleboro. Going to a Clothing Optional beach on a lake. Eating absurd amounts of food, good food, and some "bad" food. We called them Lust Pies. We used to find raspberry ones at the Mobile station. They are actually called Bismarks. Triangular tasty and gooey goodness. I ate chocolate. Drank wey too much coffee. Ate the best red meat I have had in a lonnnnng time. Strawberries and whipped cream. The food was so good I couldn't imagine topping the evening off with sex, and if you know me, that is unusual.  I laughed till my tummy hurt. I was in the big bathtub. I was almost done bathing and my foot was squinching the rubber plug from the drain and it made this....amazing sound. Like a whale song. I did it again and again and again, splitting my sides with searing laugh-pain each time. Then I progressed to the deeper, fuller, resonding fart noise. Which had me almost in a fit. Okay...it *was* a fit. So childish and so pure and so real and so, so very funny. I did this for almost 30 minutes, then realizing the pruny-ness of my fingers, realized it was time to get out of the tub.  The next day was perfect. Perfect. A full nights sleep, wrapped up with my Beloved passed too quickly. Only to deposit me....  On the Other Side.  Suffice it to say yesterday sucked rusty scissors. I got a ticket for having an unregistered vehicle, DESPITE the fact that I bought and registered my car last month. Apparently they swithced the plate registration (charging me the ten bux, of course) but did not renew. No wonder I never got the sticker in the mail. 100 clams later I go to the RMV and spend another 45.00 on new registration sticker. All this , me broke, unemployed, trying to keep my little family buoyant.  I had dreams of running around NY city in barefeet trying to find a bus back to Boston. I was lost. I woke up to a new day. One cup of coffee later it feels better, so far.  But, I am a bit mistrustful.

      I got yanked over to a cool link yesterday: http://www.pranafloat.com (linky linky)  And today, seeking solace from the never ending blather of my nine year old (who is turning into a two year old day by day....clingy, spills....must be growing like mad and propriaceptively challenged I guess...)I decided to simulate float therapy in the local pond.   We go swimming there on the days we don't go to the beach. It is literally right down the street, and it has one of those loverly floating docks in the middle for jumping and diving. The shallow end was warm, almost bath-like in this August heat. Blue damsleflies were bopping about, fishies were darting in and out of the pond grass on the side, and the water was clear.   I lay back and pretended to Just Be. I attempted weight-less, and managed for more than a few minutes to really let go the rope of Life and Stress and Be Here Inside Now. The water filled my ears and I could hear the cadence of my breath, feel the sun on my face, and sense my arms draped in the water, heavy at my sides. I started to Go...Somewhere. Really. Nice....until:  "Joey!!!!!!!!!!!Come HeeeeYa!  Come HeeeeYa NOW!!!!!Joseph!! Did you HeeeeYa me???!!!I said, 'COME HEEEYA NOW!'" Splash. Splutter. Flutter. Scream. Wail.   Choke. Sputter. Flail. My daughter told me I had boogers coming out my nose when I finally found footing and stood in the almost waist deep water.  I think I shall have to go to Manchester, NH. and fork out the bux next time.

       urlLink    I am waiting for this key. And the contents of the box to which it belongs. The money will smell clean and crisp and the cool coins will slip through my fingers singing to me of the power and fluidity within the weight of them. The little tag will bear my name, and hold my future. The string will be bright red, tiny, silken, waving in the breeze below my fingers as I hold the key to the lock. The lock which stands between me and my lack of debt. The lock which betrays my needs, deaf to my plight, my burgeoning credit card bills.&nbsp; urlLink
