        Its funny how I put things off up until now.... I wish I had practice the art of saving a long damn time ago.... Here I am now out of school...Back at home ( thankful that I could come back home) with no space... I mean REALLY no space... I have suit cases they are potential firehazards in the furnace room I because all that crap cant fit in my closet or the room at all... I am constantly bumping something&nbsp; and that's to say the least. Space is VERY necessary for the life of a 23 young woman.... How can I be organized in a space fit for a mess. All of this say exclaim why in the hell didnt I do what I KNEW I  should  and   Could   have been doing a long damn time ago.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I am now tweeking because I am ready to go--- I cant.&nbsp; I mean I could but It would be in my best interest... Hmmm best interest... I obviously didnt gave a rats a%! about that earlier.....&nbsp;&nbsp; well I can do now is do what I do.... Imean making a decent salary for my age is cool but you wouldn't know by the TAX CUT.... I mean DAYUM can I get a tax BREAK. geez.... You think you are going to be ballin but you really come out smallin.   This real life stuff is something I aint ready to get used to!

         All my life I have had the luxuries of life... this I am&nbsp;now learning at the age of 23.&nbsp; Here I thought some of my other friends and it had great only to know I had it good.... That theory is still up for discussion.&nbsp; During my matriculation at Bennett College, I wondered what was to become of my life..... Never did&nbsp;I expect to be working for the dentist from hell--- in the hole of hell.... I am glad to have moved on to BIGGER and&nbsp;BETTER things like screaming on the man who just cut me off on 267, &nbsp;or maybe honking at the girl picking her nose on 66.... or maybe catching hell for being late after sitting in traffic --only to get here to kiss someone 's &nbsp;ass. Wow!&nbsp; Is this really the real world?&nbsp; Apparently so... and its just getting started... I am trying to act the best interest of my performance rating since it is doomed, since I am late and not cuss the "causcasian persuasion" out.... which you know would be nothing short of a breath of fresh air for me...      What would a good negress do???????...   Keep it cute&nbsp;I presume.... which is what I will attempt to do.....

          Thief - 1. One who steals; one who commits theft or larceny. See       Theft      .         This is the first of many topics that I will linger the gloomy cloud over today. Everyone knows of or have known a thief that has affected them in some way shape or form. My thief as of today is--- well in order to be clandestine will remain nameless. We will address  THEM  as the  THIEVES.         I do not appreciate when people talk down to me as if I just dropped out of Eliott Jr. High school at the age of 12 in grade 6. Dont EVEN try to play me! See thats the thing that blows me about people... they assume that for whatever color that you are, or whatever variable they want to draw their so called "scientific hypothesis-- follwed by their counterfactual,  and usually short-sighted conclusion" about what the hell is really going on. This is how people get uckfed in the workplace forreal. DO not underestimate a black women intelligence. She just might kirk the hell on you-- and then dare your ass to say something. See, this brings us to the noun that I am speaking of...  THEFT.  The thief would have just robbed you of your joy as you sit at you PC and entertain yourself via your CD player with Anthony Hamilton.... Why don't people get the message that I am trying to remain clam on a day when there is a continual fire and anti- terror alarm going off that is nearly sends my ass into cardiac arrest. Hence, this blog.... My joy is already being tampered with by things that I cannot control and yet you (THIEVES) want to add to the isht???? Actually no wait that was not a question. .! People are coming to me with the dumbest things.... I see right now that as you get older just go ahead and add a fat ass helping of stress on the side. . Trust me no need to pull out your wallet -- it pays for itself. I swear I can Not understand that when people have a ucking problem they have to email every damn body and cc everybody else!!!! Do something.! Get a task... These THIEVES better learn how to talk to me before they get knocked down. Just because you don't look like me gives you no right to irk the hell out of me for the small stuff... Do you see this is what I mean when I say these people will send me str8 into racism... And I am not even racist! All I am saying is approach me like an adult and show me some respect... I am getting huffy and puffy so I am gonna roll.          I hope that this is somewhat understood by others and just soley just for my personal benefit.      Lesson to be learned: Try not to let other steal your joy....... Thieves will always be in your presence even if they are dormant at the time.... so watch out.....

      Lately I've been exploring my strengths and weaknesses.  It's sometimes harder to come to terms with your weaknesses, well that is, if you are honest with yourself.  I've come to realize that there is nothing wrong with having weaknesses, it's a natural human trait.  But, we must learn to work on our weaknesses, while capitalizing on our strengths.  Often the difference between being good and being great is  making adjustments that allow you to spend more of your time developing your greatest strengths.  'Fixing' your weaknesses can be quite easy with enough discipline, determination and training,  Unfortunately, some of us tend to confuse weaknesses and limitations. Weaknesses reflect a lack of skill (how to do something) or knowledge (whatyou know). Weaknesses can be overcome by education, training,experience and practice. On the other hand, limitations reflecta lack of motivation (what you do well naturally).  It is essential to build on your strengths.  If you want to move up from being good to being great, know what your talents and motivations are, and build on them. Why? Because you will develop what you do best and enjoy most. These are your strengths, and they are yours for life. You can build on them, and they won't let you down.

        Dreams touch every level of our life. They may let us glimpse the future, or give suggestions for healing, or share insights into our relationships. Above all, they can and will steer us more directly toward God.      &nbsp;    Do you ever wake from a dream but can't quite remember where you were? Then an image may gently float in or something sparks your memory. Suddenly you recall a scene as real as the world in front of you.       &nbsp;    Dreams are windows into worlds beyond the ordinary. Some people have dreams that give them guidance about the smallest details of their daily life along with profound spiritual insights.
