      &nbsp;My headache finally went away after a nice two hour nap. When I woke up, I decided to live on the wild side for today: I would begin playing the awesome game of NOX today instead of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. OMG I know its crazy. Today marks a special day on NOX, for I have downloaded winhack, a universal game hacking tool, and used its awsm powers to make my name UNKICKABLE in games. I won't go into the&nbsp;complicated&nbsp;details of how this was done, but I will say this: I used a guide. With such power in my grasp, I couldn't decide exactly what to do. I lept towards the nearest CTF game I could find and created a new breed of wizard: THE PYROMANCING&nbsp;SPAMMER (PMS). He is currently the greatest fighting machine to grace NOX, and by far the most polite, he carries two wands of recharging alchemic fireball, and uses his magix to fire another, bigger, more explosive fireball..FROM HELL!!! When he's not blasting away on small unsuspecting groups of people with his invisibility, he's using his gift to enchant his allies nearby. He can give people force fields, give them super speed with haste, and even turn THEM invisibleHOLY SHIT  =======================  I would have some screenshots of me blowing the fuck out of weakened men and children, but I couldn't exactly figure out where the pics go when I press "Print Screen". Oh well.  =======================  After that, I moved straight to Morrowing OH YAY! Here's the lowdown on my char: He began as a travelling one-man circus with the ability to jump BILLIONS of feet into the air and land like a cat with&nbsp;some kind of hover boots. He made lots of money doing this, and spent it well (read: blue clay pots and pillow cases). Until one day...a man named Cassius Casedus told me how much of a Novice n00b I was. I just couldn't take that, so I flipped out and jumped through the ceiling and uppercutted a man named "Flingo". "I KILL U" I raged and then broke Cassius' neck in 15 different places.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a man in a black cloak approached me and threatened that if I don't join the Morag Tong, a super secret CIA group of assassins that kill random people legally for no fucking reason at all, I would-meet-my-DOOM. Naturally, I played it safe and joined, now I check in at the sewer base and collect little pieces of paper that say I can kill a certain person. I spend most of my time travelling in pursuit of the location, as the directions in my briefings suck. When I do find the place, the person always seems to know who I am and has a posse of peasents ready to back him up with a big can of running away like a bunch of pussies.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hit of my "Daedric-Dai Katana" and down he goes. I spend another 10 minutes jumping back to the base, because jumping is way more efficient than ordinary running. They always pay me 1000 gold/septims/drakes for my heroic task and send me off for a few days until they need another pawnbroker or dirt-farmer killed. In that time, I return to my "Stronghold" which is comprised of&nbsp;my one and a half story house, a three story manor inhabited by a satan worshiper, my local pawnbroker, and a doubledecker house full of a bunch of gay lovers, who I killed to make room for my Alchemical Ingredients Warehouse, and my world famous "House of Zany Things". The House of Zany Things is where I put out-of-the ordinary items I find when I go looting in dungeons and nobles houses. It's full of crazy ass stuff like drums, lutes, and the enterprising Scamp, a pink goblin down&nbsp;on his luck :(  At my Stronghold, I always find entertaining, soul eroding things to do, such as and not limited to...  1.)&nbsp;Slaughtering merchants who happen to wander too close for comfort.  2.) Whipping my miner-slaves (they mine eggs at the EGG mine LOL!)  3.) Weighting the button down on the controller so I can get ahead of the gang on my athletic skill.  4.) Going to other towns and stealing forks and spoons, and dumping them on my roof.  Yes, Morrowind is quite an addictive game, almost as addictive as that damned Harvest Moon...  ============================

      Taking more time to look at the template (and its HTML) and letting myself succumb to my worsening headache, I've decided to let it be...for now. It's not that bad, is it?

      &nbsp;Things got off to a bad start with my other blog ( urlLink http://aaronbennettspain.blogspot.com/ ) because well, I forgot my password, but then I also realized I wasn't sure about my user-name. Also when I tried to get an e-mail back for my information, I learned I had mistyped my address... So all you've read so far leads up to this being my new ☼BlogSpot☼. Right now I'm working on making the template less gay oriented, which should take a few hours. I'm pretty sure I'll do my first official post later tonight...or maybe not, it all depends on if I still have this accursed headache.

      Hi, I'm Cat Stevens A.K.A Neldardo-Fan. I'm a close, personal friend of Mr. Bennett, and I can honestly say, no one takes a shit on your face like he does! I'm honoured to be his lapdog, and making posts and witty comments on this blog. ( I'm also happy to be banging his girlfriend, but don't mention that to him, Ha ha!)  I enjoy sodomy, magic invitations to raves, and the wonderful game called Bible Thumping. Feel free to send me an IM at shortfourt.  Have a great week, you cocksucking devil worshippers!                         - Cat Stevens, AKA Neldardo-Fan
