      The following material is just something that used to be part of my aim profile section called "My Opinions" ..new material for today will be posted..keep the questions coming.   "Our Society" Once upon a time, people believed in respect, marriages were forever, and people actually gave a shit about life in general...that is until about 40 and some odd years ago when our parents were born.  Their generation helped fuck up our generation. Perhaps it was the drugs, perhaps it was the fact that their parents sucked, maybe they wanted to be rebels, who knows?? But I think everyone in my generation will agree that it was our parents who caused our generation to plummet into a moral and ethical downward spiral, as well as making life even harder than it is.  The concept of morality and good in our society is diminishing and maybe thats just party of  some sort of plan?  If you think about it, all of history has been a big wave as far as anything is concerned, and i believe that right now life is reaching the peak of carelessness.  People are becoming more selfish,  less responsible, and not focused enough on whats important; everyone is becoming so focused on "living life to its fullest" that they lose focus on the importance and value of certain things in life.  People take the concept of living life to the fullest, and abusing it.  Sooner or later though,  someone somewhere is going to wake these people up who are living in their dream worlds and bring them back to reality.  Someone HAS to start teaching our generation to make "right" what our parents made "wrong" in our lives...if that doesnt happen, the next generation is going to have to put up with the mistakes our parents made as well as our own, and their lives are going to suck double fold!..remember, only YOU can prevent forrest fires!  "Smoking weed." I know alot of people that bitch at people for smoking marijuana, when really they should be bitching at the people who smoke cigarettes. Weed is a gateway drug, true, but only to the weak. You can probably call Tobacco a gateway drug because people get used to smoking something..they indulge in tobacco, so why not the weed right? Those who smoke cigars already have half of the necessary ingredients to "roll a blunt", so why not get the other half? Everything in life has BAD effects, but people usually ignore the effects in favor of the good results...think about it..You see commercials now for medicine..lets generically call it Med-X. Bla bla bla Med-X has been known to alleviate menstrual cramps in frogs under the age of 20. Med-X is not for everyone. {lower sneaky voice} Med-X in most cases has cause side effects such as deterioration of the liver, anal bleeding, and migraines. Now..if i'm a frog under 20 who has severe menstrual pains, i'm probably going to take that Med-X to get rid of the pain..and ignore the side effects. Call me biased, whatever, but smoking tobacco products has far worse side effects than weed. Plus tobacco products are more accessible than weed, they are legal, and cheaper. People smoke them because they can. You dont get a high or anything from tobacco products...so what the fuck are the benefits? Why smoke them? If youre going to fuck up your lungs why not fuck them up and get something out of the deal. Smoking ciggarettes is like drinking a non alcoholic beer thats high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and carbohydrates..why would you drink that..i mean youre not going to get drunk..just fatter, right? You wouldnt. So whats the point of this opinion that i spouted out about for a good paragraph or so. There is none. Who cares who smokes what unless you dont like either type of smoke.

      Well well well such a heated subject these days, since nearly everyone has an "asshole boyfriend" , a "bitch girlfriend", is single because they cant take it anymore, or they just cant find "THE ONE"..relationships ahh yes, its all fun and games till someone loses an eye, or has their ego hurt.  I've seen or have been in nearly every category of relationship...I'm old..and wise... All men are assholes, or psycho, or possesive. All women are bitches, or crazy, or clingy. FACE THE FACTS PEOPLE...no one is perfect... You never will find someone that is perfect, but rather you should be trying to find someone perfect for you...aka YOUR TYPE.. The trick here is..look at yourself..figure out whats wrong with you, because people, we're humans, find out what your biggest relationship flaw is, face the facts, talk to the exes..talk to your friends that are bluntly honest with you.. WHATS WRONG WITH YOU...if anyone says.."nothing" theyre nothing but lying ass kissers...theres something wrong with every one of us.  Now once you've swallowed your pride you should first seek a PERSONALITY in a person of the opposite sex that seems to match with your flaws..using the above flaws as an example...possessive guys and clingy girls are a good match, whereas an independant guy and an independant girl are sure to fail.. Now GIRLS AND GUYS, we all know that looks are a major factor..but personality FIRST...find compatability, then look at what thet look like..theres nothing wrong with having physical taste...some guys are breast men, some girls like really big dicks, whatever...All of us, both guys and girls have their tastes, don't deny it. You have to get to really know the person as well, figure out what you like about the other person, but more importantly what you DISLIKE about the person...if what pisses you off about him/her isnt that big of a deal where you can blow it off and it not be a major emotional trauma for you, youre in good shape! Otherwise, fuck it..you can try and try and try and it will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever (takes breath) ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever... work..if it doesnt work with someone, its not a crime, youre JUST INCOMPATIBLE, get over it...move on  I've been in this spot before, and IT SUCKS, but suck it up, life goes on.. Remeber, this life is YOUR life, and you DESERVE to be happy. If youre not with someone who will make you happy, dont start all that whiny self esteem shit, just get over it. You will find someone in time...that is if you stop concentrating on the one person you arent going to work with.  Relationship people, the key is COMPATABILITY, embed that in your skulls..COMPATABILITY...you need to be paired with someone who you can deal with PERIOD.  Ooo and onto the single people...yeah the single life is fun...some girls/guys like being players, some girls/guys like being single, some girls/guys are afraid of being hurt, well join the fucking rest of the world. If someone comes along and you feel you are COMPATABLE with them, fuck it, take a shot, whats there to lose at most, a few months?? wow..big fucking deal..you have roughly 960 months in a life time, you have a few to spare..remember relationships provide somethings the single life cant, and NO NOT SOMEONE TO DO ALL THE TIME..well yeah..thats a given but..good relationships provide a feeling that you cant ever ever ever recreate with anything else...some call it LOVE...ya know..that thing you tell that guy/girl so they will do you? yeah well when it REALLY happens, you'll know it. And also, you single fucks(this includes me), DONT LOOK FOR SOMEONE...you pathetic fucks, the more desperate you look, the worse off you are..yeah..SOMETIMES it gets lonely, but thats life...stop thinking the grass is greener on the other side..and don't rush into anything..be you and enjoy life  Guys/Girls its a rough world...someone somewhere will like you for you, its your life...Remember:compatablity is key to happiness in relationships...if youre single..living life for the sake of living is key. REMEMBER: ITS YOUR LIFE..YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY, live it up mother fuckers..and read this Bon Jovi - It's My Life  This ain't a song for the broken-hearted  No silent prayer for the faith-departed  I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd  You're gonna hear my voice  When I shout it out loud   Chorus:  It's my life  It's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just wanna live while I'm alive  It's my life   This is for the ones who stood their ground  For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake  Luck ain't even lucky  Got to make your own breaks   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life   Better stand tall when they're calling you out  Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life!

      "So the good boys and girls take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits Maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers And all of our parents They're getting older I wonder if they've wished for anything better While in their memories Tiny tragedies  They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side  I wanna run through the halls of my high school I wanna scream at the Top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above  I am invincible As long as I'm alive"  So here I am staring at my computer screen talking to Cleopatra and Adrienne, with my winamp on...and John Mayer..no such thing comes on. "I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above", Mayer sings...what does that have to do with me you wonder. Well In my last post I believe i touched on the idea i sort of have that my life isnt real at all, that its just a movie.. Well have you ever thought that perhaps what you thought was the real world was nothing but a generically created atmosphere that you've been drawn into thinking is real because you've been part of it for so long? Sometimes i wonder...here's why: It seems that my life follows certain patterns for certain things, like when someone does something bad to me, something bad happens to them shortly after automaticallyl; something i'm not the cause of. If you were the movie producer and I was a character in your movie, wouldn't the viewers love for things to be bittersweet, ya know, in america, somehow the good guy always wins? Yeah.. Ever drive under a street light and have it turn off and on??? Well become me, then you'll notice it more often, since it happens too much? Oh and of course theres me being psychic. Now at first read all you fuckers will smirk at that, as if its a joke..due to what you see on TV. Well you are part right in doing that, since what you see on TV is a JOKE..its to make money, its bullshit. I have proof, people will vouch for things i've predicted.  It's not like i look into a fucking crystal ball and see things will happen, but things come to me in a variety of ways.. First, sometimes i Do  see things..those types of predicitons come to me in the form of imagination almost.  Picture yourself dazing off into space in class. Well at times i've "dazed off" and then just random things filled my head, some of which WERE just imaginations, but others have come true. I've told people when i've seen things.. i usually tell one person to be safe just so that if it DOES happen, i have someone to vouch for me.  The other form the predictions come in is kinda weird to understand.  I'll just be talking, and something random will come out, something not part of my concious thoughts; and it will happen out of nowhere. There is no set time when i get either type of prediction coming to me, i can't turn it on and off, and normally i cant tell the difference between the first type of prediction i have and imagination unless it really comes true. Messed up huh? Well yeah, pretty much but go ahead and tell the people who have been witness to this shit that its a lie or i'm nuts(ok well i AM nuts but thats besides the point).  Anyway...sometimes i joke about me being able to read ahead in the script, that is, the script of life..as if the "Director" has allowed me to do so...there are some things I JUST KNOW and I don't know why I know them.  Perhaps there is a director...  Whether life is a movie or something else, theres a chance that its not real, bottom line and I like exploring that idea. "So the good boys and girls take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits Maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers"  Well if life isnt real, then think about it, theres no right or wrong answers, everything just changes based on your choice. Usually when things don't turn out right, people usually refer to have made a mistake, but thats only because of the result. Had something good happened, its most likely because of the end result. If thats the case, why do i spend my time worrying about being good and doing the right thing...who the fuck says anything is the right thing...it may all be relative to the individual..is there really an absolute? Also, people spend their whole life looking for answers, asking why why why to everything that happens. But why ask why..it happened and theres nothing you can do. Is there really an answer at all? Why look for one? FUCK IT "They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side" thats right..there is something waiting for you on the other side, who can say if its better, or worse,but you have to take chances, seek what you do not know..ALWAYS take the chance, you can't lose something you don't have. "I am invincible As long as I'm alive" Everything in the world has a gain and a loss.  As long as you have your life, nothing can take it away except death. Don't live for death, live while youre alive..live for the sake of living.  Ok enough about life being a movie and all that..though i try my best to think that life isnt real, sometimes things happen to make it feel so real. It sucks alot because it seems like my "real life" problems are more complicated than anyone elses.  I usually have no problem solving anyone elses problems through advice and stuff, but no one ever has answers for me.. i'm fucking superman..gotta be the leader, wear a smile and not let whats bothering me really affect me, but sometimes even everyone's hero runs into something equivalent to kryptonite...sometimes i'm weak(though i dont usually show or admit it) and i need some help, but no one can usually help this hero. I'm usually stuck picking my self back up and continuing off and being a superhero to someone else.  Its a good thing i'm a strong person, who else will save the world? lol I'm sure some payoff will come for me..where i'll get mine..and until that day comes, i'll do my best to stay as sane as possible.   For right now i'm done talking about stuff, maybe i'll have more to write later, but until then.... umm cant think... fuck it

      Word/Phrase of the moment: "Asshouse"  Can be a noun-Shut up, you asshouse. Thats a great asshouse.  If it was up your asshouse you'd know it. Verb-  quit asshousing around and lets go.   Adjective-I'm sick of this asshouse food. Prounoun.  I was just talking to bob.  Asshouse said he is gay.  any use of this word must be followed by giving proper credit to R theodore lopez for its creation or legal action may ensue, you ASSHOUSE!

      Ahh yes, welcome to the odd and semi wonderful world of my life. For years now, I've been almost convinced that my life is a movie. So much happens in it that makes life seem all too unreal. If you sit and think about it, its amazing how so many tiny little things come together just for one small thing to happen.  It must be nice not to sit and think deeply about anything, to be simple and free of any sort of complication. I find myself quite often being cursed with having a brain...and it SUCKS!!  ahh yes...a journal..something to read..somewhere to post my happiness, anguish, and other sorts of feelings...This probably won't be just used to piss and moan publically about my life like alot of people's journals(now don't get upset peoples, the truth is the truth), though i'm sure i'll do my fair share of that,lol.  This will be used to jot down some memories i'd like to be able to look back on as well.  This is my time capsule so to speak. My life has been full of many interesting twists and turns ever since i've become a socially functioning human being. I've been through everything from the death of a friend to the death of a 4 year relationship on the bad side, and Being a pro wreslter to joining a Fraternity on the good side. Point here being i've concluded that in life there is no win or lose, it all evens out in the end...for every good there is a bad, for every win there is a loss, ..blah blah you get the point.  I don't think anyone has had it easy in life, and if you have, good for you, don't take advantage of it, appreciate it. My life has been kind of rough growing up.  In my younger childhood I dealt with an incompetent and irresponsible father (that i still have to deal with to this day) and my mother who was generally ass backwards, most of the time nuts, and not really there.  They had a way of never being there emotionally when I needed them to be. In school I wasnt much of a social person(for some reason i felt excluded and isolated from everyone else most of the time). If you combine those two things you have a hell of a brickwall to climb when youre growing up. Now somehow, I'm here...i've made it..alive at least..and sometimes well.  There are still alot of battle scars left over though, and here and there they poke through. I find myself at times struggling with life, and having difficulties with it that come as a result of my upbringing.  It took me a long long time to realize that I indeed do have some issues, and then even longer to do something about fixing them.  But here I am now, nearly 23 years old. I've made so much progress, through self help, through the advice of others, etc..Now that just made it sound like I have a terminal illness or something, but thats not it, its more of a curse.  You see, i'm different, and a big cause of my struggle with life is accepting difference, as my mother would often ridicule anything and everything she considered "different"(like putting clothes in a dryer).    yeah yeah..cry cry cry..  anyway...here i am, sophmore/junior in college, 22 years old. I should be out in the working world, and starting to get serious about being on my own..but instead here I am, in the sucky poconos.  There's a backstory that goes along with college and maybe it will be theraputic to me so i'm going to type it.  The setting is the years 1996/1997..I have aspiring dreams to be a pro wrestler, and I love watching ECW; the atmosphere is so intense.  I work at mcdonalds, and its a shitty job, really stressful, but is money and mom gets off my back some now that i'm working.  I'm the computer nerd of the family, as i spend a good portion of my day sitting online, talking to people, and just playing with the computer in general. Everyone in the family says I should go to school for computers since I'm good at it, so why not?  Apply to Penn State Main campus,and I think Wilkes and another school which is escaping me at the moment.  I'm not the best student in school but overall i end up with a 97.something overall average and will graduate 17th in my class....SAT scores first time around 1175 and had no ambition to take them again.  I've been in the gifted program since 1st grade at old forge.  I've gone to old forge elementary and old forge high school(which is the same building), the only "one town, one school" school district in NEPA besides dunmore.  My family is lower-middle class, we have a simple house. Dad's always working..on the road, at this time i think he's in insurance or home improvement, and mom works at either boscovs or sam's club. I have a little sister, 9 years younger than me.  We live in a simple house, nothing fancy and hell i have no real idea of what anything fancy really is, clothes, or other.  In School, i'm pretty much unknown, I talk to a few people here and there but not enough for it to count. I'm pretty much the quiet kid, i'm an observer of everyone with a life and if i wanted to be any more than that, I wouldnt know how because who do i have to learn from. I've always been somewhat shy and some even say "backward"..at this point i look 4 years younger than i am.  I dont know the difference between clothes from K mart and clothes from Structure, just because I was happy with just having stuff to wear.  Generally if you see me, I have the same haircut i;ve had for years, a really bad side part comb over, its really really lame, I wear tapered blue jeans, usually arizona brand from JC penny's, and a champion brand shirt, and the only shoes i will wear are Nikes and not because theyre a brand name, its because they are the only ones that felt like they fit comfortably.  At this point I dont think much of myself, because frankly no one else does...none of my peers give a shit about me. My friend since kindergarten, Chris, has been in a 'serious' relationship now for maybe a year or 2 and has a habit of screwing me over for his g/f quite often, and anyway i have no real life, I dont go out, i don't do anything.  I have another friend named peter but he's in the same boat as i am. My closest friend right now would have to be my cousin pat.  I hang with pat and watch and play football for fun, though hanging out with him is usually stressful for me all in itself because my mother seems to have something against that side of the family(guilt trips for spending any time with that side of the family ). So there i am, nothing to no one, and along comes a girl out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, this nobody starts to get attention from girls, and not that i havent had any girlfriends prior to this, but i've been in a slump for quite long enough.  The attention came after I joined stage crew for a play upon suggestion of peter's brother rob and some talking to chris about the girls IN the play. So..thus starts my first real relationship.  Her name was first brought up by my friend chris as being an airhead, but there was just something about that airhead that caught my eye.  Suprisingly, she wasnt the only girl in her class that had her eye on me, but all my attention went her way.  (How that relationship ended up is a long story in itself, but we're on the subject of school)..I fell in love with heather and she became the sole focus and care of my life as i really had nothing else.  She loved the shy goofy kid who looked like he shopped at kmart for clothes(and did), who wasnt anything to anyone in that school, who no one gave 2 shits about; she gave him her heart, and he gave her his.  I was in love for the first time, and for the first time i felt like i was somebody..and so what if i was just somebody to one person, thats all that mattered.  Heather and I were very different(and if  you read the above description about how my mother instilled how to handle difference into me, you'll probably be able to guess how it ended up) but we seemed to get along allright at this point.  I cant exactly remember how things were working out in the early stages of the relationship, but i think they were pretty good considering we were both just "kids".  Heather was always there for me, and though i was often embarassed about my mom being such a f-ing nutcase, she was there for me.  When it came time to decide where to go to school, somewhere along the line, a fight ensued between me and my mother(which wasnt uncommon, hell at least one a day), which ended in "I don't care if you work at McDonalds the rest of your life". gee thanks mom for the encouragement.  Well i did decide to go to school despite my mothers excessive pessimism, and chose to go to Penn State..Penn State scranton, that is.  I had to choice to go to main campus but i was paranoid about losing heather if I went away, so i stayed home..  I went there for 2 years, and in that 2 years time, i continued to work at mcdonalds, Heather worked at Mineo's pies, and things seemed to be going fine at home.  I finally got some balls, stood up to my mom and didnt speak to her for over 6 months, didnt rely on her for anything at all...i started to separate myself from her negative influences...notice I don't mention my dad much, he was never around, and when he was, he was my moms puppet.  Heather and i at this point were constantly on the rocks, and that seemed to be the only thing going REALLY wrong.  All the shit my mother put me through seemed to seep out in this time as I was probably one of the biggest A-hole psycho boyfriends you can possibly be...i wont go into details, i've had to face my mistakes enough as it is, but hell use your imagination and it probably happened.  Anyway, i had some new friends and we collectively called ourselves the Kommunity Kult...bad bad name and we had fun getting drunk and pissing off all the cool people...we were just a group of nobodies but as a group we made ourself somebodies. the year 2000  is when the hardship really came around.  My dad decided that he didnt like my mom anymore and got a g/f only 2 years older than me. Heather graduated high school, and at this point the tie that bound heather and I together was as strong as bubble gum.  The situation with my father worsened problems with Heather and I, as I began to question if i REALLY loved her.  I began to live in a world of doubt because the only thing i was sure that would always be in my life besides heather, my family, was exploding apart. I witnessed things go to shambles firsthand. I quit mcdonalds because my father had a new job at PA resources and was on the road to making over 100 grand a year, so he told me just to concentrate on school and don't worry about working.  So i Quit. PSU was about done with me so i transferred to the U of scranton to continue my studies. Not working didnt work out so well as when dad left, the money slowly stopped, dad didnt make much money as he accepted a lesser position.  Heather and I blew up totally, this along with dealing with all that goes with mom and day splitting, problems with friends, i didnt do as well as i should have at the UofS. Eventually the credit cards I had...which up until this point i was able to handle, started to get unbearable, since i didnt have a job and had no money coming in, the credit card+the mac machine was the only way to get any cash for food, gas, car payment, etc.  I had to get a job, and heather and I worked at PA resources doing telemarketing. My father hit a slump and though he had his young fuck buddy, he went downhill, when he needed money he'd come to me, who didnt have much to begin with.  Hey john, i need to ask you a favor, can i borrow your discover platinum..i need a few bucks, i'll pay ya back...sure dad....  eventually the bills got so much that paying them became the focus of my life.  I eventually stopped going to school after just 2 semesters at the U, heather and I had broken up, my life had hit rock bottom. I reconciled with my mother finally for all the insanity she had caused in my life, she apologized, and she was on medication now to help her out.  I cashed in some old mutual funds to pay off some credit card bills, but that eventually went to shit as dad needed more money to buy and fix a house and the payments got too much for me.  It was time to start scraping my ass up off the concrete after life had run me right over and start from scratch.. I didnt know who i was, as the only thing that made me me was heather, i didnt have money, i stopped going to school, no money, nothing...i was a failure...  Today December 2,2k2...Dad got his g/f pregnant, she should have the child in a few days, mom is struggling to keep the house and provide for my sister, i have HORRIBLE credit as there was no attempt made by DAD to pay off anything really, and fuck, where the hell am i going to make enough money to put a dent in like 50 grand of debt?? But there is a positive, i'm starting to finally find my niche in life and who i am. I'm a very blunt person, i like to say i'm an asshole sometimes cuz hell its true.  I love my families, i'm a very giving person, and what I want out of life is to get my feet firmly planted.  I want to be in a position where i'm not struggling anymore...i managed to get back in school, here at esu. I've advanced leaps and bounds socially..i actually go out, i worry what i look like, and damnit some people like me..people think i'm attractive now and though at times its hard to handle the attention its much appreciated.  I have a few good friends that i consider family and a diverse range of other friends as well.  I'm going to finish college in around 3 semesters which i'm looking forward to. My dad, still an ass...promised to help me go to school he'd pay for my car payment..and well...this one is almost a month overdue so i had to pay for it with christmas money my grandmother gave me to pick out clothes or things i need from her.  Next one is due in 9 days, yet he doesnt seem to show a bit of care.  I'm managing life pretty well emotionaly, but there are times where i just want to give up...i still find myself doing some things like my nutty mother used to.... but i'm doing my best to manage.  I feel like i'm too much for anyone to handle and put up with, because i'm so complicated, so deep and so different.  I've had alot of life experience so far, and i like to help people out, its like a hobby or something, but when it comes to helping myself out, its really hard because i'm so emotional.   This post has taken forever to write, i think i need a break...but hey..thanks for reading..who knows what will be in the next episode of my life...who knows...who cares? Hopefully by now..someone does~!  PS..this isnt meant to cry really, its just to kinda let you all know about some things in my life thus far... Goodbye  "I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away... I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days"-Ozzy

      I got this nice email the other day forwarded from my best female friend eeever, heather.. Read this stuff, its heart warming, and since its the holiday season and all...i know its a depressing time for some, me included..read this {most is taken word for word from the email, anything with an * by it has been added} FACTS OF LIFE 1.At least 5 people in this work love you so much they would die for you. 2.At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 3.The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. 4.A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you. 5.Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 6.You mean the world to SOMEONE. 7.Without you, someone may not be living. 8.You are special and unique in your own way. 9.Someone you don't even know exists loves you. 10.When you make the BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER, something good comes from it. 11.When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look, because you most likely turned your back on the world. 12.When you think you have no chance at getting what you want, you won't get it. BUT, if you believe in yourself, you will get it sooner or later. 13.Always remember complements you have received, forget about the rude remarks. Everyone says bad things about other people, so when you hear something good from someone take it to heart*. 14.Always tell someone how you feel, then they will know. 15.If you have a truly great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.

      Hmm...havent written in a little while....finals AND SHIT to worry about... Here's a few tips to help be successfull in life.  This isnt the complete advice article on how to be successful, since i havent totally determined EVERY variable that brings about success. Perhaps success isnt totally in our control anyway, perhaps there has to be some "outside help" to success. Just think about the last thing that happened in your life..successful or otherwise. THink about how many tiny little minute things had to happen preceding the event up until the very moment that the event actually happened.  Think about how if just one of those things was out of place it could have caused the event to not happen at all.  It makes you wonder if any facet of this life was preplanned...  Anyway here's 2 tips for you..some good advice ..some i've heard and some i've come up with myself:  Don't take NO for an answer. There is no reason in life why you cant get exactly what you want.  First, dont ask questions, rather use statements.  That way someone is less likely to respond in a negative manner.  In this case you have to be careful not to sound like a dictator. Most of the time when people tell you NO, they dont have a good reason, or the reason they have isnt as good as they think.  Don't give up until NO becomes YES. If you want something...go and get it. Don't let anything get in your way, especially some jackass telling you NO.  Don't try to do everything on your own...delegate responsibility.(thanks to Matt "Chester" Phelan for sparking the thoughts on this one) This one is officially useful for you leader types out there like me.  Many times people end up pulling their hair out because they have so much to do and so little time. The great part of having friends and family is that they can help you out if you need it.  Most of the time, people will be happy to help you out since it seems that everyone is almost always bored. You must be wise in choosing who help you in doing what.  For example if you needed someone to pick up certain alcohol for a party, it would be useless to assign the job to someone under the age of 21...it would also be useless to ask someone who has 3 brain cells to do it because chances are they won't be able to get the job done correctly..so maybe you can have the person that is under 21 pick up the munchies for this party and the other dumbass can fget the babes for the  party because usually really dumb people are good at people skills. The point here isn't how to throw a good party, its how to find the right people help you on the road to success. Befriend a computer dork, a grease monkey, a mafia hitman, a chef, a nightclub bouncer, a bartender, etc etc... People like to feel useful...make them feel useful...think about it, people become things so they can be used for those things...we are life whores~!  Remember kids...if you want me to write about a certain topic, or respond to any questions, either im them to me JMS504 or email..jms504@juno.com

      More posts coming soon, but for now just a song for some people to fucking think about.  My child arrived just the other day  Came to the world in the usual way  But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  He learned to walk while I was away  He was talkin' 'fore I knew it  And as he grew he said,  'I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  You know I'm gonna be like you.'   Chorus  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.  'When you comin' home?'  'Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then.  You know we'll have a good time then.'   Well, my son turned ten just the other day.  He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  Could you teach me to throw?'  I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'  He said, 'That's okay.' And he walked away and he smiled and he said,  'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  You know I'm gonna be like him.'   Chorus   Well, he came from college just the other day,  So much like a man I just had to say,  'I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?'  He shook his head and he said with a smile,  'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  See you later. Can I have them please ?'   Chorus   I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  I called him up just the other day.  'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'  He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'  And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  He'd grown up just like me.  My boy was just like me.

      Well its been forver and a day since i've posted anything.  Over break I got absorbed in the whole being lazy thing.  However, break is over now..so its back to the books, beer and babes.  Ahh yes..college life. Today is superbowl sunday, and I believe i forgot to give a shit or something.  I used to be big into football. I followed the Dallas Cowboys religiously..and NO I didnt "jump on the bandwagon". I liked them before they started to win their 5,287 championships.  Now I don't really want to waste my younger years away in front of the TV. When i'm old and out of college and working a real job, I can see myself getting back into it all.  Right now i'm too into "living life" and all that to put watching football at the top of my list of priorities. And Oh ya...i'm 23 now...gotta use it before i lose it.  Now back to deep thinking and things of that nature.  Its about that time fellow humans...and NO i'm NOT talking about the superbowl...NO i'm not talking about someones "time of the month" and NO i'm not talking about lunch...The time when all the animals come out to play..with each other.. The dawn of mating season for all of the creatures is about to begin..soon it will be upon us, and when the dawn breaks,  walking five feet without seeing 2 rabbits making sweet bunny love will become a rarity.  Mating season is something that applies to all animals, not just the furry ones(shut it and shave it)...we humans are about to kick into the mode where we have to prep ourselves to look the best we can for the opposite sex.  People who havent set foot on a treadmill will begin running like it's their job.  In the winter, we cover up as much skin as possible, and during mating season, we show as much skin as possible without getting arrested. It's a time to do whatever it takes to make yourself a theoretical marketing success...you want to be a hot product, that EVERYONE wants to buy. Time to SELL away. Now that sort of sounds pretty bad, whorish and cheap, but thats how we are created, that's our nature, that is nature.  There are just some facts of life that we cant deny at all..they are built in.. Nature says that all creatures will have the obligation to mate..thats right people...all creatures...male rabbits need to mate just as much as female ones.. The question is though...what kind of mate does each of us want?  Not every creature is looking for the same kind of creature...there are many different things that are taken into consideration when deciding if we want to mate with someone or not.. First there are a few categories of the type of mate we want.  Some rabbits are looking for rabbits they can have a long term rabbit thing with..while other rabbits are looking for a one time rabbit fuckfest.  Now of course as nature would have it, girl rabbits are more prone to be looking for the long term rabbit thing, but that is not always the case..there are alot of girls who just love good sex...and bad sex..just sex in general.. Anyway, finding the perfect mate for yourself is never an easy task, unless you're lucky and get a royal flush on the first deal.  But most of us have horrible horrible luck. If i knew a statistician, I think i would make a webpage that helped you figure out the chance of you finding YOUR perfect mate. You would type in things about your life via a survey type interface(ooo lets get all techinical), and then things about your ideal mate...then on the server side of the web page..a trained statistics monkey would figure out the probability that you will find your ideal mate, and then send it back to the user..who in turn will look at the screen and say..."Fuck...I guess it's time to move to cali."   It's common knowledge that finding someone who is perfect for you is nearly impossible.  All rabbits have a predetermined idea of what their perfect mate is like.  Since most of us know we don't have a snowball's chance in hell of actually finding that person, we have some thinking to do(or you can just not think and do everything of or resembling the opposite sex). In this time before the main event, mating season 2003, begins we must figure out what areas of our idea of the perfect mate we're willing to do without.  Perhaps a girl with a mustache ISNT THAT BAD...ok no wait...I take that back. This is the time us humans should think about things like this..because we can. Those dumb fucking rabbits can't think to this capacity..so they just mate with whatever...and their buddies don't bust their balls for doing that really really freaky chick with the messed up ear.  Think about what you want..what is necessary in your perfect mate(long or short term, or once and say goodbye term, whatever your flavor is) and what is not.  People who are too idealistic will be stuck with no mate and a sticky hand..while people who have no ideals will not only be laughed at by friends and non friends alike for what they did last night, but they will also kill of any bit of self esteem they may have, contract some fun diseases, and live a life of regret and shame(and really what fun is that?).  So rabbits, get your brains in gear...think some..guys,use your bigger head(hopefully) before your little head leads you to rosie o'donnel, and girls go ahead and do that guy that looks like gilbert gottfried..so i can LAUGH at you and tell you to come back and read this next year because the damage is done already.  Think before you pink.  Peace Love and happy fucking. The man, The myth, the mother fucking legend, Me

      Hellllllllllllllllllllo... I was getting ready to write a nice long post about "Pride" but i'm not so sure now I have all my ideas on the subject totally gathered and organized but I am going to give it a shot, then go off and ramble about something else that may happen to come to mind.  Pride.. You're a football player, you're proud to have made the team. You're rich, you're proud of your nice car and your armani suits. You're a midget, you're proud that if you move to chicago, you dont have to breate in as much smog as the "taller people." You're stupid, you're proud to be polish.  Pride is something everyone.  It comes in many shapes, colors, flavors, with whip cream, underneath your clothes, inside, outside and everything in between.  If youre proud of something...great...many people work hard for many things, and when you finally reach a desired outcome.  Reaching your goals comes with bragging rights, but often times things get out of hand...pride goes overboard and morphs into the evil exessive type of pride often assoiciated with ego's and the like.  So, when then does pride blow up...NEXT ON FOX...WHEN PRIDE ATTACKS!!!!!!  Instead of coming up with a generalization to create a pride meter...i've decided to leave that work up to you and in place of those few paragraphs, I am going to write about some "Proud people" who annoy the Fuck out of me.  Headline:Suicide Rates in Schools with Evil Cheerleading Cults are likely to be 98.731% higher than in schools without them. These sort of people cheer themselves on... The warning signs of this groups are the excess of self-high fives, "Like OmIgodddddddds", and "GOOOOO US's".  These people are only cool because they think they belong to something that only special people JUST LIKE THEM can belong to.  Headline:King of the world complex drives football player George Hitler to try to take over the world, only ending in him nailing all members of the evil cheerleading cult. These people only join things  because a so called status level comes with it, and once they obtain the status level, they think that everyone else in the world owes them for just being alive.  Common phrases heard among this group are " I scored the winning touchdown last week bitch, blow me! "Of course i can cut in front of you!  Don't you know i'm the president of student council."  "I'm chadwick worthington III, my father owns the company your father works for, so wash my car you peon".  Headline:"During last weeks football game, there was major traffic jams in the bathroom line. True cause unknown, but the suspected person for the incident was known to stare at herself in the mirror for hours and having her ass kissed by her only 2 friends in the entire world."  Go to a party, and look around..you'll see this version of pride gone wild somewhere in a corner, and if you see this type at the PERFECT time...which is most likely all the time, you will notice this person and his/her 2 lackies pointing  and laughing at you or any other given person that isnt inside this twisted circle jerk.  Granted some people do suck compared to some other people as a matter of opinion, these Circle jerks refuse to be part of anything but their circle. Common Phrases : "You: Hi, how are you? "Response from circle jerkee:".....(ignores you, turns to lacky) LOOK AT THAT GIRL...CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHES WEARING...WHAT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WHORE" "...." "................"  Headline: "Bruised Ego causes student to kill a girl and her 2 lackies at a party" This type is known to go off and want to start a fight on any given chance; as soon as someone says something that they feel threatens their image, this type is ready to fuck you up. This type overall takes life too seriously and their ego is the most fragile part of their body. Don't breathe on the glass ego..you do..it shatters, you die. Common Phrases: "You:My car is black. African american w/glass ego (overhearing you:OOOO YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT..I gonna fuck you up cracker..we was enslaved by your people and you aint gonna be dissin me..i'll pop a cap in yo ass"  "You(to your friend) Nice shirt fag. Dyke w/glass ego.:Ya know..FUCK ALL YOU MEN..You're all womanizing pigs, thats all you do is use girls like us for sex, (kicks you in the nuts) (dyke turns to girl next to her) come on honey..you dont need to put up with this, lets go fuck)"  Pride..have it, but don't abuse it...or you will become as beat as a read-headed step child.  And now..i'm done talking about pride.  How much pride is too much? YOU TELL ME..until then...some lyrics that apply to something...can YOU figure out what that is?  "I'm head of the class  I'm popular  I'm a quarter back  I'm popular  My mom says I'm a catch  I'm popular  I'm never last picked  I got a cheerleader chick   Being attractive is the most important thing there is  If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond  You have to be as attractive as possible  Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean  Wash it at least every two weeks  Once every two weeks  And if you see Jonny football hero in the hall  Tell him he played a great game  Tell him you like his article in the newspaper   I'm the party star  I'm popular  I've got my own car  I'm popular  I'll never get caught  I'm popular  I make football bets  I'm a teachers pet. "-Nada Surf  Peace -J

      Here's a bit of "wisdom" i found in my buddy Mark's profile: I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.  I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big weenie or huge boobs.  I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  I've learned that you can keep puking long after you think you're finished.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away.

      For the first time in a long time, I was contacted by someone to write more stories about my actual life, actually...he said i should write about my "drunken exploits" Well either way...the question lingers...should I expose any aspect of my personal life to the public? Hmm...Reality...everyone loves to watch everyone else's "real life" on tv to remind them deep down how much their life sucks. No doubt though, reality TV is pop...Shows have arisen about families in real life, such as the Osbournes..Fat girls eating real life, such as the Anna Nicole show, there are "real life shows" that cover the genres of dating, becoming a star, and surviving in the middle of nowhere for a period of time.  As of last year, Musicless T V, introduced a new flavor into the realm of "reality tv", Greek Life.  Now, we've all heard about or seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and we know(or at least we SHOULD KNOW) that Greek life and Greek weddings have only one thing in common, the alphabet.  But regardless...GREEK HAS GONE POP. MTv introduced its first peek into greek life last year upon its showing of "Sorority Life".  Many criticisms of the show have called the first season of this life watered down and I agree.  The show picked a tame sorority.  The girls were very goody goody, and the pledges that weren't, were looked down upon by the sisters of whatever sigma something something pi.  We as the public didnt get to see girls swallow goldfish, or kiss each other, or even run around campus naked with "SLUT" written on their foreheads.  Have no fear though, based on commercials, MTv is ready to correct their mistakes from last season, with Sorority Life 2 and its new series, Fraternity Life.  These kids look CRAZY..just like most greeks.  Will this give  greeks a bad name? Fuck yeah...with their parents maybe, but who cares? They'll get over it.  The general public will finally get a look at why its good to be greek.  The older people will get to see what they missed back in the day when they were too big of pussies to become a pledge, and the younger crowd will be more drawn to Greek life as a result.  Everyone wins;well maybe except for the the greek chapters put into perspective.  Many Greek organizations have laws set in place against certain likely greek activities such as hazing, alcohol consumption, drug use, and bestiality, no wait..that last one goes hand in hand with rednecks, not greeks...my bad.  These exploited chapters may very well not be chapters after the shows air, but hell, at least they made it to Tv.  They sold their souls to go pop.  Nothing wrong with that, Publicity is publicity, and in the long run, publicity is money.  Speaking of money, Hollywood is cashing in on Greek Life, and the only thing big and fat about this wedding with a greek fraternity to comedy will be Will Ferrell's wallet.  Since Greek has gone pop, this movie is a surefire hit. The movie will pull in every "greek" to the theaters for sure, along with the inquisitive, and the usual movie goers: those who like comedies, those who like Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Craig Kilborn, Juliette Lewis, Andy Dick, Seann William Scott..ok you get the point, lots of stars..lots of laughs, this movie is going to be money, and it doesnt even know it.  I'm in a fraternity, and i'm going to see the movie no doubt because it will be a good laugh, and if its not, i'll take it out on the pledges(kidding....maybe). Well speaking of fraternities, tonight is Initiation Night for our new members, pledge class, whatever you want to call them. This is the kickoff for a 6 week period in which our new guys do various activities to work their way into the fraternity and get acquainted with everything and bla bla bla.  Now obviously I cant possibly expose anything we do to the public as i'm bound by contract and fraternal bond to keep my fucking mouth shut, but if its drunken exploits you want, i'll try to give that to you.  BUT cough cough ahem..greek life is NOT all about partying...its also about doing well in school.  As academics chair of my fraternity, i'm here to promote studying hard, trading the beer for books, and getting A's. :) :)  Now with that out of the way, beer is good . Not because it necessarily tastes good, but because it has alcohol in it. Parties are good, and not necessarily because they have alcohol at them, but because they have girls drinking alcohol at them. I'm going to make an effort to let you in on  Greek Life here at ESU, and my life in general, because thats what you all want. I've always said controversy breeds interest.  Writing  these sorts of journal entries are extremely difficult because when you choose to open up your life, personal or public, to the world, it's possible many people will disagree with you, some will hate you, but EVERYONE will judge you.      It's important whenr reading entries of this type, to keep an open mind, after all it is a privlege to have a look into someone else's life.  If I do decide to write details about my life and you have a problem, comment, or compliment with what i wrote, hey, thats fine, email me ( jms504@juno.com).  In most cases I will post your email along with a response on this journal.  Happy reading. Congrats To Zeta Beta Tau Zeta PI Alpha Epsillon Class. Condom and a necktie.  Just a leadup into today's sound..i've decided to STOP being nice to those who don't merit it...So FUCK OFF...you piss me off, you're fucked..enough said.  Twisted Sister - We're Not Gonna Take It  Oh we're not gonna take it  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh we're not gonna take it anymore   We've got the right to choose it  There ain't no way we'll lose it  This is our life, this is our song  We'll fight the powers that be just  Don't pick our destiny 'cause  You don't know us, you don't belong  Oh you're so condescending  Your gall is neverending  We don't want nothin', not a thing from you   Your life is trite and jaded  Boring and confiscated  If that's your best, your best won't do  We're right  We're free  We'll fight  You'll see  Oh we're not gonna take it  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh we're not gonna take it anymore  Just you try and make us  We're not gonna take it  Come on!  No, we ain't gonna take it  You're all worthless and weak  We're not gonna take it anymore  Now drop and give me twenty  We're not gonna take it  Oh crinch pin  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh you and your uniform  We're not gonna take it anymore

      I've been meaning to post here for over a week and a half now, but i've been soo damn busy programming soda machines and all that fun comp sci stuff, going to fraternity functions, lifting, going to the mall and all the fun usual stuff that i havent had the chance.  My post that I was going to do LAST sunday was going to talk about how fucking insanely awesome Don's Party at the house was on that previous saturday.  Since theres no chance of me remembering EVERY party detail..heres a few. The place was PACKED...HOT..and covered in beer.  Working bar is the Absolute best job...thats where you meet all the people and the people love you because for an hour, you are their beer god.  Among the notable events of the night are me dumping a full cup of jungle juice all over Jenn Higbee because she spilled her beer on me, Ray dumping a full cup of beer on a girl because she was giving him some unnecessary attitude at 2am, and the girls walking around without shirts on...half naked chicks..always a definite plus.  Ray, Kayla, Erin and I had an awesome time.  Our tree in the fraternity definitely knows how to fucking throw some killer parties.  We were talking about renting a house semester at one point too, and that would be awesome...but I don't know if thats a good idea, since I don't have much free time(if any) the way my major is. I dont think I'd be able to handle more stress ontop of what I go through.  Anyway..awesome party..I was drunk...damn that evil don and his 7 kegs.  Late into the night on my way home I was treated by a FREE shower from mother nature.  In other words, it started to fucking POUR. But nothing was going to bring my  "high" down that night.  It was one of those nights where you feel like you are truly alive...high on life kind of thing..but remember, you have to come down from ever high, and I will get back to that thought later on.  The rest of the following days were hell and then some...Sunday night and Monday were spent in the computer lab..for hours and hours and hours..and hours :( NOT A FUN TIME.. you;d be surprised how annoying  and time consuming it is to teach  a computer how to sell you a fucking pepsi. ITS ALL YOUR FAULT...YOU DAMN CONSUMERS!...shit..i buy soda...fuck(HITTING MYSELF IN THE HEAD)..;) anyway...that was monday...then tuesday, some of wednesday and thursday were spent playing with cars and cdrs..which, unless you are Matt Young, you will have no fucking clue what that means either, but just know that it SUCKS... FINALLY..thursday night I got a chance to chill...stopped by the bar and grabbed some guinness and black and tan, and went to the house to drink a little...ok..more than a little.. I had a nice convo when I was working outside  with Jeff Collier about women, and then..the unthinkable happened..... I signed up for Beer Pong with My good friend, and new ZBT brother, JB Markle...we watched as The king of all beer pong at zbt, smiley, and his partner, Shaun Egge, destroyed the competition team after team. We decided it was about time to make smiley frown and crack the egge,,and BEAT THEM. Thats right...myself and JB..the underdogs. The game started out with the  champs handing us our asses, but the more cups of evil natty we had to drink, the better we got...we started to sink them...their lead shrank down to nothing and eventually we got the edge.  A half hour had passed of this INTENSE beer pong battle..it was 6 cups to 3...us ahead...and smiley...SANK ONE... FUCK!!!! EGGE sank one...FUCK FUCK FUCK  4 to 3.JB and I take shots..and BOTH miss.....SMILEY and EGGE take shots...One made one miss...3 to 3...out nowhere john and i make 2..get the balls back and miss 2, smiley makes one...2 to 3..John and I shoot, i made one, john missed.  2 to 2.  Both smiley and egge miss..balls come back..JOhn makes one I miss one. 2 to 1....Egge and SMILEY BOTH MISS.....I take the first shot and miss..and out of nowhere in one swift flick of the wrist...JB used all of his stored up redneck power...and MADE IT....WE FUCKING WON......HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!!!! WE BEAT SMILEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was one of the best nights of my life...hands down.  Friday Ray and I decided to go home and stay over night. We went to banana Joes Friday night with Zambricki and Mr. Cella..  Place was packed off the wall with alot of lovely Valley Girls...something you don't see much of at ESU...the retarted midget was giving zambricki dirty looks and flipping him off as usual.  We had a few beers...fought through the crowd a few times...played the AGG....then went into the bar in the techno room.   Shortly after. Lou "Mr." Cella..saw a few of his students...they saw him..he got embarassed and left.  LOL never fails lou. Its kinda sad, because there aren't many people at home that like to go out and act their ages..aka party...be social..etc.. Lou's an awesome friend, but what he can do is limited by his profession,understandably.. and of course we encouraged lou to pass his students along to us..but of course it was a joke.  Towards the end of the night ray saw his cousin and we were talking to him and his friends..then we went into the dance club and got elbowed by some ignorant fucks, all who strangely turned out to be black..and i wasnt the only person that noticed that either..so FU... On the ride home we did our usual half drunken ritual of singing crappy 80s songs..though we didnt have we're not gonna take it..which was disappointing...but the night was still tits.  In other good news....7 dvd;s came to my house with the correct address for a person named Joy..and under PA consumer law , i got to keep them :) Also, ESU sent me some money, so I went to Muscle Mag and got some Cell tech and Muscle gainer and 3 new shirts to wear at parties :FU, Undercover Police, and Kappa Tappa Kegga...all for 20 bucks!  Saturday night...another kick ass party at the house..Ray and I were heavily plugging our first ZBT party of the semester that was supposed to happen today,monday...the Graffiti party.  The night came to a screeching halt when the NEW landlord came and shut us down...here's the BAD part I was talking about before. The guys that live at the house had a meeting with the new landlord last night and they have 30 days to get out(something about too many people not on the lease, and he doesnt want any big parties..now what fun is that?). This leaves us without a house to throw in.  Thats a major MAJOR problem in my eyes.  Now, being in a fraternity isnt all about parties, but its an essential part.  It splits importance with academics, Brotherhood, Community service, in the respect that..the way the community gets to know you is community service, the way people get to know you is socially...especially at parties.  This is going to fuck up recruitment quite a bit.  Those who dont see that happening are blind.  People know the frats by the kinds of parties they throw..etc..thats where you meet everyone..people you wouldnt normally see on a daily basis.  Theres a colony on campus, ACACIA...they don't have a house...RARELY throw elsewhere and theyre recruitments have been pretty bad... It sucks for the guys at the house especially because they are losing where they live...that Really really really blows.  I'd be lying if i said that i didnt care about drinking, being social..parties..hell thats ONE OF THE reasons why i joined ZBT in the first place..i'm in college to finish college, but i'm also here to party...i missed out on it in high school and i'll be damned if i'm going to miss out on it now.  I love zbt...my brothers are awesome..great guys..really..something you wouldnt expect with a FRAT(and shut up..yes I DO CALL my country a CUNT.Its the only place here i have an extreme amount of fun..its the only place i feel like me.. But I know life is about change and dealing with it. As a fraternity we now have to stay afloat and get people on campus attention other ways until we come up with a soluton..Slak,Kevin,Seneca,Egge, Joe B, Curtis ,Aaron, and Steve hopefully will be able to find some place to stay too..and rituals...who knows..i'm sure our fearless E-board led by Young Matt Young will be able to come up with something.   This news hit me pretty hard because it reminded me when something I worked for, and others worked for hard, for several years, Underground Wrestling in NEPA died.  But in this situation, by no means is ZBT dead...we just experienced a setback, we'll come back..we always do...Just like last time when that fucking flaming homesexual of a sad excuse for a human being, let alone greek advisor, kevin lockwood, put us on suspension last semester...FUCK YOU KEVIN..and tomorrow is officially FU kevin lockwood day...Where at The Interfraternity Council meeting tomorrow, he will be getting a collective FUCK YOU from all of the fraternities on campus because he is being a big DOUCHEBAG...and in honor of FU lockwood day..i will be sporting my new FU tshirt.   So well those were some sorta quick details about my life...  Now a few quick thoughts about life that i came up with today while walking to the caf.  -The past is gone, the future may never come, the only thing that is real in life is NOW.  -Life is ever changing...as you read this, something in YOUR life is changing, be prepared.  Umm...no song to think about right now..maybe i'll post one later.  As always, you have any response to anything here...email it to me..jms504@juno.com.  Its great to be a Zebe. RUSH PIMP!!!!!

      Hey people..havent had a chance to update lately..lots going on..and this damn computer decided to fuck up..so i had to erase everything on it :( I just read something on a web page sent to me about life..and it says alot of what i think...weird...read it for yourself..if you havent gone through this phase yet where you think this shit...you will...its not fun...read up kids.  From Katai's Indestructible Web Site: "They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn`t know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get hot and scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to you  aren`t exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you are. You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.  You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren`t so great after all. You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want.  Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not. You are insecure and then secure.  You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the enemy and you cry and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. The stupid ones plateau, the smart ones rise.   You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can`t meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You wonder what in the hell is wrong with you. You worry about loans and money and the future and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, right now you`d just like to be a contender!  We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them. We will piss one another off, and laugh at the end of a conversation that started with angry words. We are a group that talks behind the backs of  the same people we call to meet up with on a Friday night, but we are sorry about it and we know that we were just being insecure like they have been.  What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it and we are all in this together. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are friends, and in 10 years we will be friends who have figured out where we fit in in this world.  If people expect sincerity from others, they should be sincere, otherwise do not expect anything at all. Having heart to heart conversations is being real. Wish you and myself all the best of luck. Put unhappiness aside and go with the flow.  "   Keep in mind..i didnt write that...just borrowed it from that web site. Peace and Love JS

      Ahh my precious journal..how could i Desert you like this? We haven't talked  in such a long time, other than an obligatory "Hey How's it going". But finally we have time to sit and talk about things...alot has happened since we had our last real conversation on the third of march. You've heard me time and time again talk about how  it only takes one second..one little thing to change your entire life..and how many many little things have to happen at that exact second as well...weird how life is.  Can you relate, Journal? I mean..You wouldn't even be "alive" right now had had a collaboration of many thoughts all at once...the need to express myself..the pleasure i get from someone enjoying my writings...the flashbacks to the old "Straight Up" and "Feel the experience" journals of sorts from the old JS michaels web page, my personal appeal to seeing into peoples lives(ie reality tv, matt youngs blog), some sort of odd motivation AND whatever else was going through my mind at the moment...at some point, Journal, All of thoughts sent me to blogspot.com and a few hours later..you were taking your first steps...you were alive..there I was expressing myself away..typing into this edit box what was flowing through my mind..i poured out my soul. Ever since then, when I needed you to listen, you have.  At times i've said some things here that maybe i shouldnt have exposed to the public, but still Journal, I dont see you as a mistake just because of any strife that may have come as a result of  your "birth".  "There is no such thing as a mistake...there is only what you do and what you don't do"  Write that one down..its from the movie Unfaithful.  Allright...well i'm sure some of you were amused..and most of you were frightened by me "talking" to my journal..but hell, how boring would it be if I did the conventional "haven't written in awhile" opening..that goes something like..bla bla busy..bla bla computer something...bla bla ok heres whats going on in my life...bye..  I've been looking through my link tracker and noticed a good deal of people i dont even know are reading this, and thats good..very good..for those of you new to my world..go back and read some of the older entries....half of the stuff here may mean nothing to you otherwise.  If youre not new to this journal...then keep reading....I know you've come back multiple times waiting for an update..and  I'm delivering now...Unlike the pull out method of birth control..i'm extremely dependable when i have to cater to my Audience.  Throughout this entry i'm going to write in some song lyrics from songs that are currently playing..I have my winamp on random usually when i write and there are about 2500 songs in the rotation...these lyrics may or may not have any relation to what i'm writing..Don't read into ANY of them. They are random.  I just wanted to do something different and unconventional..and I wanted to do something that pretty much made no sense otherwise..ehh..this is what i decided to do...the song lyrics will be displayed within 2 double asterisks...ya know..those star looking things... For example, lyrics may look something like this...lets pretend a vanillla ice song is on my winamp and i decide to write lyrics say NOW **Allright stop,collaborate and listen, ice is back with a  brand new invention** THATS what it would look like...and now that preschool is over, its time to dive in to my life..or something like it..  When last you really had a window into my life...the march  3rd edtion..You read about ZBT losing our house,a few crazy parties, Me and markle beating smiley in beer pong, and some philosophical thoughts about life. Just some quick updates on all of those subjects before moving on to now. The "house guys" got another house...pretty far from campus..its good for them because they have some place to live but bad for us that like to party...We did however a  few going away sorta parties and a tap with Lambda Iota **You kicked my foot under the table, i kicked you back, I cant Say i'm able** which surprisingly DIDNT suck..the first non sucky tap i've been to actually.  Smiley turned 21 at a good time because his beer pong career has been sidelined by the lack of a place for him to persue his dream...Ever since the defeat..smiley just hasnt been the same..some say he lost his smile...should we then start calling him 'y'..as in WHY did i lose to markle and sopp? hehe As far as the philosophical thoughts at the bottom of that entry..i havent yet found anyhing to make me want to modify them in any way..they seem to be holding true.  Now here's the part in my writings where I use an event to the past in order to transition into the present. In the last entry there was a mention of a trip to Banana Joe's that occurred the night before the infamous "Don's Party"...and that night that one second happened that would turn my life as i knew it upside down in a way.. I failed to detail that night but in  nutshell, heres what went down: **i aint gonna live forever, i just want to life while i'm alive..its my life..my heart is like an open highway..like frankie said "i did it my way" i just want to live while i'm alive**    **and a time to every purpose under heaven**   Ahh yes...Fraternity issues...last friday was a ritual of ours which i'm glad I attended...as you may or may not know, i have trust issues with people in general...and I think guys more that women, but anyway...I got a chance to really know the brothers that showed up..but even moreso..they got to really know me...By looking at me i doubt anyone can figure out who i am inside...my brothers that were there now know me..and I got a renewed sense of the meaning of brotherhood...we really got to **And i knew if i had my chance that i could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for awhile** bond..and to all those brothers who didnt show up..its your loss and i'm deeply pissed off about that... The fraternity seems to be quite weakened right now...the loyalty to the brotherhood is weak..and i've decided at some point to kick my skills for leadership and problem solving into gear and work on making ZBT solid as it once was...We really have a lot of brothers with alot of heart...they just need motivation and we'll be ontop in no time... If i had the chance i would certainly run for a position on the E board..and i'm really honestly considering it...but if run for anything and lose..i have  Ideas and i'm not keeping my mouth shut..i'm motivated, mother fuckers!! Oh yeah..by the way..i've been nominated for IFC VP...which i probably won't get..but it was nice to get nominated **and i dont want to lose your love tonight**  but i'd rather have a position in ZBT than IFC  Right now the thought train has died..john and ray are here..so i cant exactly be in deep thought..but thats my life right now... ohh and looking back on some quotes..i DID NOT force the songs to play while they were playing..and some did make sense with what was going through my mind but it was in no way premeditated... Time to not write anymore for a bit.. Bllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.. A few random thoughts -I hate my major -I'm hungry right now -wow..ray has a girlfriend -the vampire moth -matt likes old cdr's -war is reality tv -I miss you baby -he fought the birds for the candy bar -cinco de mayo -cheddar jay -the cuddler -a drive Thanks for reading...  Peace

      If I were to describe my life in one word overall it would be "change". I actually have to go back to the last journal entry to see where I left off..All the way back in APRIL..holy shit!! Well..where to start.. First with the fraternity: We had a sit-in on the quad for four days in the rain and cold to benefit women's resources...great bonding time for the brothers and others who showed up. We won greek week for the fourth year in a row.  We kicked ass during Greek Sing..how's this for a set..."Lose Yourself", "Livin in America", "U cant Touch This", "Proud To Be An American", "Theme From Cheers". Yeah..thats what I thought. I won an award from The IFC(oversees all greek orgs on campus) for Emerging Greek Leader. I was elected Vice President of the fraternity. We did a walk for march of dimes. We still need a house. 99's Ray, Jay, and Tyler all got the grades to get in...it's all depending on the vote now boys...  The last few weeks of the semseter were crazy, as expected.   Myself, Matt Young, and a kid named Jim did a group project on the programming language, Python, and kicked ass with that. I got 2 A's and 2 B's this semester for an overall 3.4something GPA...which is tits.  Myself, Ray and Volch took on a project which we named "MONSTER HOUSE". It involved taking the room next to the bar, and changing it from landfill status to live-able.  Stuff was torn out, Painted, Curtains were hung, TVs with stupid plugs were moved, and the end result was a room for raylo to run his brothel. Other parts of the project included adding a tv and a beer pong table to the bar, as well as a fridge, some sweet lights, a microwave and a road sign that somehow appeared in my bar one night!! ;p  The monster house project ran from May 8th to 12am on May 12th. Coincidentally, The monster house idea was STOLEN by some certain TV NETWORK...as the show airs after Monster Garage. MOTHER FUCKERS...DAMN HIDDEN CAMERAS..DAMN MY LIFE BEING REALITY TV!!!  If you noticed, I edited a post from awhile back.  Yeah, theres good reason for it...maybe its just that my heart isnt in Germany, and wasn't in Taylor either.  Yeah...thats a shoot. Burn any bridges lately?  Some news on the Wrestling front...A good friend of mine is starting a local wrestling promotion..should be interesting to see how this all works out.  I'm going to shut up about it since it's his baby, and not really my beans to spill.  I'm back in the Gym...found a great gym thats only 29 bucks a month, no contracts..This place is awesome...and thanks to that gym, my tits hurt!!!!  Hmm..i wanted to throw out the asshole of the post award to Larry Morris Jr for Never paying me the money he owed me from two years ago memorial day.  Lately, i've been thinking about the future...about life after college..and things of that nature..it's time to do some planning already...Right now i'm looking for a good job for the summer still...I am banking on one job but if that doesnt come through there are a few others I can apply for.  Coming up THIS WEEKEND is markle-fest.  I think I will end up leaving later in the day because kay has work till late afternoon and Volch does too..not too sure if he's coming though...  Speaking of parties...email me or im me and persuade me to have one!  Remind me of how good natty from a keg is...or the wonders of jungle juice. Bring back Frank The Tank.  I saw several movies... XMen 2..Matrix 2 and Bruce Almighty.. XMen 2 kicked ass...the Matrix Sequel was pretty good, and Bruce was OK...could have been better...in an "Anger Management" sort of way.  This summer is brought to you by "Keystone Light"--Whose house is this anyway?  I had several great drunk nights out with Raylo, Volch and Brick...one of which ended with cds being smashed all over my car..yes..SMASHED..and volch eating one of them. The other ended with drunk 80s song signing as usual..and cd frisbee. Perhaps I have some deep hatred for CDs...maybe I should look into getting that fixed.  I've been slaving hours upon hours to get this new web page up! Enjoy it!!!!  I'm feeling good lately..being home did something for me..or maybe it's being away from the stress at school...or maybe it's having my heart right where it belongs, or maybe its 80s music...whatever it may be..I'm feeling great...and anxious for the Fall semester.  With that, I leave you..No promises=No lies..so i'll post when I post..and hopefully it will be sooner than later. Check back frequently.  If you don't have it, you should download Poison's Cover of Rock & Roll All Night off of their Hollyweird CD.  Enjoy your Chicken Dinners -J

      "you came you drank you passed out, and thats what Marklefest is all about"-John-Bryan Markle, Sgt At Arms  Marklefest...Markle Smash Summer Bash..Call it what you will. For Myself, Kay, Ray and Volch it began on Saturday at around 545 PM.  The ride from Scranton/WB was basically a straight shot according to Markle's directions. Follow 81 South, Pick up 83 and then get of at Glen Brook..."If you guys make it to Glen Rock I'll Pick you up there."  Well..around 745 we arrived in what the exit said was Glen Rock and we told Markle to pick us up..who apparently thought we got lost but he didn realize he didn't give us directions past the exit. Ahh yes..Glen Rock...Cows...Grass..more cows and more grass...a bull..a brief strip of almost-civilization which was comprised of a few houses, a getty and a hick bar..more grass..a cow...and we arrive at the Markle Estate in Glenville.  Immediately after arriving, I dropped off the admiral, the captain silver and the 99 apples above Markle's Garage, aka..his studio. Basically its John boy's playroom..nice room too with a bar. After Greeting The Franks, The Smudins, Brad, and Sue, I headed downstairs and over to the Markle house where Mr. and Mrs. Markle had TONS of food prepared..chicken wings, lasagna, sausage and peppers, burgers, and several types of salads and deserts.  The food was really good and the "Southern(PA)" hospitality was much appreciated.  We ate as much as we could to prepare for the drinking that was coming soon and so as not to offend our gracious hosts..then headed back up to Club Markle.  Thats what i'm going to refer to Markle's Studio Room as  from here on out.  It was early yet, so Markle decided to show us some of his and his half brothers video productions and play some music live with one of his local friends.  Markle did a damn good job on drums and guitar, but I think I would have rather heard one of the cattle from a nearby field sing. Eventually a spilt occurred...the frat crowd went outside one by one..We all began to wonder where the beer was...and the preps stayed inside and listened to the music.  Eventually we lured Markle outside to ask him about the beer and to our dismay there wasn't any...BUT there was a bar down the road we could get some at.  The 2 mile trek to bar began as Kayla, Ray, Volch and Franky bod piled into my car, and the Smudins and Jersey Frank piled into the SmudinMobile. I think we were all pretty much prepared for what we were going to ecounter when we opened the door to that bar, but none of us were prepared for the sight the guy passed out or dead on the kitchen floor in front of the cooler as we walked by a side door to get to the main door.  We opened the door to find a hick bar..as expected..with the added "pleasure" of old toothless people in overalls playing fiddles and banjos creating a night that frequent patrons of the bar would call the best night in their entire lives.  We, however were a group of college age kids who knew this night would be nothing short of a nightmare had we not brought some beer back to the Markle Plantation.  Low and Behold..they had beer to go...One kind to be exact: Natural Light, which they sold at the cost of $8.50 a 12 pack. On a side note, Natty cost $9.99 a 24 pack here in old forge. Do the Math, Its easy: College Kids who need beer + a crafty mulleted bartender with a natty surplus=Profit for them and a headache the next day for us.   FINE we got the beer...we brought the party to the Markle Kingdom.  ZETA PI BABY!!! Anyway  the night unfolded as Volch kept his legacy alive and entertained the prep hicks to no end.  Everyone Drank heavily...well at least us frat boys did...now the prep hicks..they drank..and puked...and passed out..and lets face it..they need to drink more often..friggin lightweights. The Smudins both got really wasted and illustrated the one characteristic that assures everyone around that they are indeed sisters, and that being what Myself, Kay and Ray created into a new verb. First..used in context... here's an example. "Volch Smudined on the floor." Its pronounced like this SMOO DIHND Basically...When the smudins are really drunk, they have a habit of standing up...then all of a sudden out of nowhere...falling flat on the floor..and on the way down smacking their head off of something. Its an amazing thing to watch...totally amazing. During the party, Club Markle kicked in, Jersey Frank became DJ, The bright lights went off, the club style lights kicked in, and raylo became the bar tender.  I gave one of the prep hicks the idea of making a Beer Bong out of a soda bottle and a hose and the resourceful little fucker actually did it in a matter of 20 minutes...not bad!!  This is the first time we at Zeta Pi can say that we actually threw in Glen Ville, PA.  We brought the party...we added the summer bash to the markle smash, we put the fest in the markle and everyone had an awesome time.  The Party went on until about 4am...The Smudins had both Smudined on couches...the puking prep passed out..the slut went home..the mystery girl disappeared...the rest of the hick preps went home to wash their polo shirts...and volch finished entertaining for the night and passed out covered in mud from head to toe.  There was, however one soul that couldn't sleep an eye...The Bod...As Frank tried to sleep he was interrupted by an orchestra of snoring..from several people.  At around 7am, i decided freezing my balls off in a car wasn't the best thing to do and decided to go home early...so we packed up Erins camera, The remainder of our liquor, and the Volch and made our way home. I drove half of the way..dazed and confused..out of it the entire time...half from the natty still in my system and half from not sleeping enough..and apparently I had several off the wall conversations about naming my kids rolling rock and cosmopolitan..and at one point had to have something medical explained to me in terms of BBQ chicken and fried chicken. RayLo Drove the rest of the way home and eventually kay and i crashed until about 430 in the afternoon.  And Sgt markle...well..we dont know what became of him after that night...the last words muttered by him around 1015 this morning were "you came you drank you passed out, and thats what Marklefest is all about"...But to clarify..we came..we saw..we blew the roof off the markle estate..and THAT is what ZETA PI is all about.  I Hate Antelopes, -John

      Welcome back to my life. I just got back from running my usual route around Old Forge.  I enjoy doing that alot for reasons other than fitness; I get to think about some things in my life without the distractions of ims, my cat, cell phone ringing, and whatever else may decide to annoy me.  I'm still without a "summer job"...thanks to the wonderful economy, nowhere reasonable is hiring and nobody is paying anything decent either.   I joke a lot about how my job is applying for jobs and not getting hired, but really it's sad when ya think about it.  I have a cell phone bill to pay,I need money for books and Fraternity dues at school, plus cash for food, alcohol and having a life...AHHHHHHHH... I try not to think much about it though.. Being broke and unemployed, your life becomes extremely routine..well at least mine has for the most part. Stay up real late and bullshit with people online or play video games, since theres nothing worth waking up early for.  Wake up after 11, eat, gym on mondays thursdays and saturdays...on tuesdays cut the grass and go for wings, drink on saturday at tinks cuz its cheap, you see theres not much variety.  I can't wait to get back to school...more people, more parties and more money, thanks to the fact that i'll be getting a nice refund  back from my student loans.  I guess the only fun right now and the only thing that really makes me worth anything is the fact that I have been doing tons of ZBT VP work..getting things in order for the fall semester, talking with Kevin(prez) and Todd(advisor) about this and that...it gives me purpose and something to accomplish on an almost daily basis.  I really hope though that I get some kind of paying job sometime soon..i'm going to call Price Chopper Tomorrow or tuesday to see what the fuck is up. I guess this is a good time to start enjoying simple things like the beauty of nature...music..things of that sort that most people don't have the time to really appreciate.  Last week I went to "my place" twice to just relax, clear my head and tan...it really relieved me of a TON of stress I had on my shoulders, so I think i'll be going back there as often as possible. Right now my life is in a slump..but as everyone should know by now...you always hit the very bottom before you rise back up to the top.  I'm just taking this as they come.  I'm single now and its not a bad thing, so after you read this don't bother imming me with "sorry to hear that."  The reason I don't think it's a bad thing has nothing really to do with the relationship i had or the girl, but rather its more of an acceptance thing.  How many people with significant others have you heard say that they wish they were single.  How many single people have you heard wish they had someone.  It seems with most people it's better to be anything but themselves.  I'm cool with life, NO its not easy to deal with at times, but whatever I may be, I may as well enjoy it because no matter what state my life is in, only one thing is sure:That it's temporary.  I always say that the only 2 things in life that are definite are being born and dying.  Everything in between really has no constant.  So hey..i'm single, OK.  I have my times when i think back, and miss what I had..but then I realize and comprehend that was "then" and things aren't "now" for a reason.  The best thing a person can do is just live now, and work for a better future...so thats what i'm doing.  I'm thinking of cutting back on drinking alot for awhile...I dont think its really harming my life but the carbs in beer are getting in my way...and plus, alcohol is a depressant.  If you don't believe that, think about your drunk friends that either flip out when they get drunk, fight someone when theyre drunk, or get all pissy because they cant get any when they're drunk. I don't think I will ever swear off alcohol totally though, and its not a willpower issue.  Alcohol is part of our culture, our society, Especially in Northeast PA.  I often think back on all of the crazy and insanely fun and wild things that have happened in my life and I know that I wouldnt have this many memories if it wasn't for alcohol being involved.  Ironically...volch's birthday bash is Saturday Night at my house..I think i'm going to be all responsible and sober maybe a DD or something...just because I can.   I can't believe how quickly time has passed...but then again, why is it that events that happened last year seemed to have happened years and years ago? Weird.  Volch is turning 23 in a few days..its crazy..I remember when he turned 21 and we took him out...thats a whole other journal entry in itself.   I'm already going to be 24..i think it might just be about time to finish up with school.  First..i think i may have to because i dont know how much longer pheaa is going to give me money and Secondly, i'm older than alot of the people there, age wise.  Then Wisdom wise..people tell me i'm wise beyond my years and all that.. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE COLLEGE...call me Van Wilder..really..but I'm around alot of people with high school kid mentalities..people who aren't exactly adults yet mentally, and I find it really hard to relate, especially to the girls..their goals conflict with their attitudes.  Try to find a girl thats 18 or 19 thats ready to start thinking about having a future with a guy, and knows how to be a respectable girlfirend, really..try to find one..you'll see what i mean.  My run may just about be over...I don't know..in one aspect..yeah, I want to get out and make tons of cash, but at the same time...i'm not sick of the partying and I feel like I can do a lot for my fraternity if I put off graduating. Ahh choices choices.  I wonder if anyone is going to remember its my birthday this year.  I guess this comes from the same School of thought as wondering who would be at your funeral if you died.  I dont parallel these 2 thoughts at all being that only a handful of people last year said "happy birthday"..i KNOW a TON more people would be at my funeral whenever it is that I kick(NOW DONT TAKE THAT WRONG..i'm not saying i want to die or that i am dying anytime soon).  I don't really know why it is that it pisses me off so much that people dont know its my birthday.  I think its the whole bitter thing..where I do so much for people then feel like i dont get back enough, or that people somehow owe me at least a happy birthday or something..I don't know.  Maybe it has to do with  that fear inside of me that drives me..the fear of being forgotten or not being appreciated or even known for anything during my life and when I die.  I have this thing inside of me that I want to mean something to the world..I want to make a difference for someone..anyone..somewhere...everywhere....I want to leave my mark in this world when i'm gone...No idea how or when or even why i'm driven by this, but I am.  Somewhere along with this facet of my personality is an "idealist streak"...i spend so much time talking about how things should be and how i want them to change for, what i see as the better.  Add this all up and multiply it by the fact that i'm strong willed and a sure leader.  Thats one big equation..whats the result? Me.  I'd rather people love me than hate me, but some people dont like leaders, rules, and following..some people dont make sense and know no reason....I suppose this is why I have  a hard time understanding alot of people in the world..and society and things.  I don't really know where I was going when i started this journal post, and I'm not sure where i really ended up, but This is the wonder of this journal..and my mind. Until I write again. Peace, Love, and that other thing.  80s song you should have:18 and Life by Skid Row 90s song you should have:Can a nigga get a table dance by 2 Live Crew Movie song you should have:Any song sung by the Steel Dragons from the Movie Rock Star Current Hit you should have: Boys of summer by the Ataris Current Hit you shouldn't have: anything by 50 Cent An REM song:Man on the Moon A song you've never heard of: Temptation by Delerium

      The last post was about how hard i'm working..and often I wondered if all I did so far was even worth it, and if anyone actually appreciated it..after an IM from Lunchbox and the email(posted below) from Franky Bod. Its really good to know that i'm not doing all this work for nothing. ZBT ZETA PI: The Powerhouse is taking over!  from the email  "I wanted to say that we all, well @ least I know, that you have been busting your balls all summer for the sake of the fraternity.  And I appreciate that greatly!  It really makes me feel comfortbale, knowing that no matter what, after this spring I will not be an "active"/partisipating brother in the same level, that when I am gone I will be leaving this fraternity under you and Kevin, and a few others, you all "blead blue & Gold" and thats what we need right now.  It will all be good.  I can feel it.  This semester/year ZBT will truely peak to its hiest potential.  I can feel it, that hasn't been this much posative energy coming from the e board since I don't know when, and school hasn't even started.  its game on now bro!  Thanks     Franky Bod"

      I've been working my balls off for the frat now for months..and sometimes it gets hard because alot of the success of things depends on other people.  When I became VP and Kevin became President, we sat down and saw that there was so much work to do with the chapter in order to get it where it should be.  All summer has been spend creating new rules, revising old ones, creating committees, planning fund raisers, and trying to find a chapter house close to campus.   As far as the house is concerned, it's been a headache. Right now...its a week before the week people want to move into the house.  Between now and friday, I have to make sure the landlord sends me the lease, our national reviews it, we sign it, pay 3600 to the landlord and realtor and get all the shit settled. It's alot of stress on mine and kev's shoulders trying to pull all of this together.  I got home from stroudsburg last night and just crashed.  I just needed a few hours away from it all, so I shut off my phone, and just kinda laid there for awhile then went to bed.  Besides the house, another big stress point is going to school next monday and actually putting all of the new things into action and having to deal with the recoil from it.  People are going to bitch, and they are going to be the people who haven't done shit for the chapter all summer, so really I dont want to fucking hear it.  We're busting our balls to make the chapter great, any negativity can go fuck itself..and see itself to the door.  Ahh...so in other news..the gym..I love it..it's what I look forward to every day. I put on a ton of muscle this summer, and i'm on a good protein supplement. I cant wait to get to the gym today...sitting here at the comp is just fucking annoying.  I'm still trying to sell my digital video cam on ebay..let me tell ya..Paying as much as i did for that and people only bidding 50 bucks drives me nuts....ASSHOLES its brand new..comes with 2 extra batteries and a carrying case..WTF. We may as well call it EBroke.    Along with the frat money issues i'm dealing with, i have to come up with book money and frat dues money...  I guess looking at the big picture..nothing great comes without hard work, some hardships and dedication..i know that in the end me dealing with all this will produce a great result at some point...i'm sure when that happens i'll have a much happier journal entry...so sorry for any negativity..i dont think people like to read "this sucks..that sucks" kind of entries... anyway...pray for me..wish me luck..whatever.. ciao

      ...it's been hectic lately..and wild and crazy..gotta have the balance. I usually come back with a good party story, but thats not happening because I had a thought come into my head on my way out of my Computer Security class. I was thinking about lives and jobs, because I realized that most people who have comp sci as a major have computers as their lives.  I don't think i would EVER be able to have computers as my reason to live. Let's face it, i'm not a dork, i have a social life, i like people most of the time, and i'm not a shut in.  I would really like to get a job that I would enjoy as my life, though.  I guess one of the things that drives me the most is the need to be someone that matters to everyone.  Most job/life Ideas that have crossed my mind mostly deal with "pop culture" because I guarantee you that  more people in the US know who Carson Daly is than people who know who Bill Gates is.  Yes, Money is power, but Fame makes the US go 'round.  I want to be known..and i'm sure as hell not going to get known hacking away at a computer for the next 40 years of my life.  I need to fall into something...it HAS to happen..i cant stand being nobody..money makes the world go round, but without notoriety you may as well fly off of it, because no will give a shit if you do.  Anyone want to make me famous?? I'm very marketable!!!!  Make me famous damnit or i'm doomed to being miserable for a lifetime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :(

      Well it has been awhile...a ton of things have happened, things have change, people came and went. I havent written in a long while, not because I was lazy, too busy, or uninspired, but more because I really havent had much of a chance to sit here and collect my thoughts well enough to put them into text.   Most people will sit and judge their weekends, holidays, or semesters as "good" or "bad' but i really don't believe in that for whatever reason(though i ask the same kinds of questions, ya know , like, how was youre break, how was class, etc).  Basically since i've last wrote, I can sum everything up in 2 words. I lived. I'm not so sure that life is about anything else but living. That is, experiencing, learning, hurting, laughing, loving, missing,... So yeah, I pretty much lived. I apologize for the vagueness here on this one but there are so many specifics, that it would take chapters to recap and honestly, i've probably forgotten most of the important details so my stories would be lacking.    So now a break from what you've all missed reading about, to shift focus  to the title of this post. I was raised by a pack of girls.  Where most boys spend much of their growing years hanging out with their dads and uncles, older brothers, and male cousins, I had very little male influence on my life.  My dad and i never really shared any common interests, my male cousin was younger than me, and I had no brothers. In esssence, most of my time was spent hanging out with my aunts and my grandmothers doing things like shopping or watching stupid crap on TV.  As a result, I have been dealing with the fact of being different than "typical guys" all my life. I just didnt have the right influence and did'nt really have any good friends in high school to change this either.  Basically sometimes i find myself almost battling the world because i think and feel differently than the rest.  I often find myself confused as to whether i should see the differences as a problem and work on changing or rather be happy that there are some unique things about me that set me apart from everyone else.  I find myself deeper than anyone expects me to be. Guys are just suppose to be dumb creatures who thrive from sex and nothing else..who fear attachment...use women like toys and all that...GOD forbid..a guy who thinks;) I dunno..thats enough therapy for now..i realize this is a journal and NOT a shrink session, but i had to get that out. I think that in a way it heals me or puts me at ease about some of the things about me when i write in this journal. I think maybe people reading this will make it easier for them to understand me and i'll feel less uneasy about who i am. Oops back to my life.  Lots of crazy things going on with the frat..without outright saying whats up..theres a big change coming for me for sure in that area.  Honestly i havent gotten what i expected out of the frat. Theres alot wrong with it and if anyone has any issue with me posting that in public, i have two words for you. FUCK OFF.  In a  few posts i'm going to vent wholeheartedly about what problems i have with things regarding the frat, Just not now.  I'm at a good place in my life right now where i'm just enjoying whatever comes. Thanks to mom's advice i'm learning to chill out and not worry about much anymore.  I'm still in the prelim phase of this though because i have to figure out exactly what i should worry about and what i should brush off.  Life is constant learning...learning breeds change, and if you avoid change youre avoiding living.  This is really painful sometimes to change..its not supposed to be easy now is it?  Its almost christmas time, which typically has been a "down" time for me. I'm not sure whether thats because of not having a full normal family anymore or what but this holiday i'm trying to be "up" for once.  It seems that in life if youre in a more positive mindset more good things happen, and when youre down..the world shits on you. I'm going to enjoy all this holiday stuff. I was actually thinking of going to NYC to see the city all lit up and stuff.   Today has been a pretty much chill day...woke up late..ate..opened my mail and got a good laugh...went to  eat and to the mall with joey and heather. I guess after long nights like last night, thats the kind of recovery needed. Crazy club night last night..gotta love Ev on thanksgiving.  Just a sorta side note..I think the reason i'm so drawn to drama is because females are dramatic, i've been around them growing up, so without it in my live or around it, i feel out of place.  Anyway, back on track..i'm kinda tired right now but i dont think i'm going to go to bed at 10pm..who does that?  I'm thinking of putting some little things in this post that happened this semester with myself and other people in my life..and i think i may..in fact..NOW..some things only one or few people will get, so if you dont get it, youre not supposed to and so help me god if you DO interrogate me, you'll "mysteriously" end up with a virus on your comp that will fuck shit up big time. Now...onto the memories.....again..DO NOT automatically think they have to do with me directly..alot of these have to do with other people that I was just around for.  Pam The Cat's room Glitter, Duct tape, Shaving cream Hangin Tough The water pipe The tie Not watching lord of the rings Shot glass Betty What it is Dump the bitch This is John...he's smart..he just sits around and does homework all the time No Doubt Around the world Tell your roommate she's a dumbass 69 is a bad number Stupid Glasses ELEAAAAAAAANORRRRRRRRRRR...I'M IN MY TRAILER..THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR YOU BUT ITS NOT FOR MEEEEE Did he just piss in a garbage can? You are the most evil human being i know GOLF! Its called thankstakin..we gots ta take cuz aint no one givin You might be the dumbest mother fuckers i've ever met! Teapot..FROM THE TOP..WHERE THE FUCK IS JAY? This is like waiting in line for your funeral Fuck this shit lets go back to sleep You need anything ironed? I dont think so mister Go in back of that building and wait for the guy with the afro Yo boyyyyyyyy  Thats all i can come up with for right now..hey a semester is a long time...so if you have nothing to do with any of these memories..sorry but..cry me a river dickwad:) !  -John

      Drama is the one word i can use to sum up the semester. This semester was one big roller coaster ride. So many things happened both good and bad. Many changes occurred, and looking back on it. I dont think i've had such a busy, eventful few months in my life.  This week alone was crazy. During this week alone i did crappy on 2 finals, stayed up for 24 hours straight, got a girlfriend, got dumped, got a job, got drunk..what a week. Though this semester was fun filled, i'm glad its over. Its time to go on vacation and do nothing too productive for a month while I recover from this semester.   I need a break from people. Here at school, i'm around people almost constantly. I need time to step back from everything and everyone to just think...time to myself.  Life is ever changing, i just havent had the chance to catch up with it yet. One of the largest changes came a week ago when I left ZBT.  I have been wanting to leave now for over a month. It was a decision i had made awhile ago.  Basically I did it because I didnt see eye  to eye with what it represented.  Though i was in a position to change, I didnt think it was fair to force the change on a bunch of guys who liked it the way it was, so i stepped out.  A few other guys decided to leave too, but they did it on their own accord and for their own reasons.  Unlike what most people think, it wasnt some evil plot to sweep the feet out of the organization.  I left because i needed to. There was never a point where the group of us sat down and said "lets kill ZBT". The most that happened was me telling Kevin the prez to get rid of me because i couldnt do it anymore.  I guess its like putting a city boy on a farm and saying, "have a ball." It just wasnt going to happen. ZBT and I were two different worlds So we broke up. LOL sounds like a relationship and in many ways commitments were broken like one. But its over now.  Here I am, a few hours before I leave campus to return to my house, where I will sneeze and cough wayy too often due to my allergies to the damn dog. That little thing is sooo retarted.  I start my new job on saturday, which is great. I need money..as does EVERYONE else. Should be a fun experience.   I really dont have much thoughts right now going throug my head to spew out to all of you. So heres one that just popped into my head: --Every decision, even the smallest ones, alter your future. No matter what decision you make its affecting either your life or someone else's life in the future, so be careful of what you say and do. Though you never know the results of any of the choices they make until they happen, you should take care to make sure you are making the right choice. Life is unpredictable, uncaring, and unloving. We shouldn't expect it to treat us well. Life is what it is, it owes us nothing.  The only thing we owe to it is living.

      ..and once upon a time not so long ago it meant more to me. Not that it doesnt mean anything to me now, but it lost a lot of value(?) to me.  I don't really think because i've grown older..its more because that strong family aspect, which is the essence of most peoples' xmas, isn't there. Regardless though..i'm in a pretty damn good mood this christmas eve. Over the last few years i have been miserable. Anyway, there's lots of things going on around me but I stepped back from it all..and put myself at a standstill.  I decided to do this because I needed to catch up with life, as I have posted before. I have done basically nothing for the past week, nothing but watch some stuff on TV, play video games, sleep, and occasionally talk online.  Things have been so simple and relaxed..it's a nice life. I know, however, that this is temporary, things are about to get crazy again and I cant keep myself out of the loop forever.  School will be starting again in a few weeks, and that means alot will be going on in my life other than studying and class.  Everyone who goes to a decent school knows that college is more about what goes on outside of the classroom: the girls, the beer, the drama..ya thats what college is REALLY about. I really didnt give class my all this semester because I had to deal with breaking up with and going out with the same girl about 4 times(dont say a word..i know what youre thinking..i just dont care), dealing with other girls, sororities and their drama, breaking up with ZBT(reminded me of ending a relationship, scary huh?), that internet job, partying, being depressed and sleeping..you get the idea..not much time for class..BUT..i got a 3.0. If I had the motivation I could tackle harvard :)  So what's in store for me this semester? Well..firstly in class..Databases with Williams. She's the teacher from hell. She has no idea that some comp sci majors actually DO have lives. My first round with Williams was Nonlinear Data Structures. If you're not sure what that means, its OK..don't think too hard. I ended up working on programs for hours upon hours..days upon days..many sleepless nights. Now the sleepless nights I would rather be having include a hot girl in my bed..NOT with a FUCKING COMPUTER. If she overworks me this semester, I'm going to have to kick her fuckin ass. As far as the whole..being fratless thing after I cut my losses with the ZBs...Common sense..once you've been in a frat..you don't want to be fratless until youre done with college and in suits working 9-5 in a big city by day and drinking Chardonnay in a windowed restaurant overlooking the city skyline with a beautiful woman.  oops..back to current reality..Yeah..i want to be a frat boy..a crazy one..and I'll find a home..don't you all worry your little yarmulke's(ya..i think i spelled that right) off.  I'll be greek..i'll be something..you cant expect me to disappear..So whether you loathe me or love me..i'm here to stay for now..till i'm ready to go. So if ya see me..say hi and smile.   Oh and if i ignore you or am quiet..its because i'm trying to get back to my room to SLEEEEEEEEEP :) It's going to be one of those semesters...one of those crazy semesters that you see in college-themed movies, but you don't believe exists.  I can feel it.  Right now looking forward I have everything to gain this semester and nothing at all to lose...I have no responsibilities other than my classes, no real commitments, and a bunch of crazy ass mother fuckers that are sure to keep things interesting..no doubt no doubt.  Well thats enough commentary about whatever..its CHRISTMAS..so..its time to play santa clause and give gifts...So..if youre name is here next to a gift..youre lucky..if it's not here..tough shit, asshole. If youre not below..then its just because I couldnt spontaneously think of something entertaining to write here for you.  For Mr. Cella- A touchdown, Finally(and no..not football, Lou) For Volch- A drivers license For Spic- An electric razor...you've ran into THAT problem last spring..lets hope it never happens again For Pat- The band phish living in a tentyour back yard..you won't have to drive to see them 50 times a year anymore For Stony- No Doubt...some lysol to disinfect For Jamie- An online journal..or 10 for all your personalities to vent For Markle- Black & Tan..and by that i'm NOT talking about colors here For Lunch Box- You can have hazing for christmas..its all you've ever wanted. For Amy, Kay, Jamie-a thank you for the great times..regardless of what happened with us. For Amy- Hope ya have a good holiday with whats his face..and I hope that he hasn't cheated on you TOO much that you cant forgive him. For Kay- a thank you for whatever great times are to come..regardless of what will happen with us. For Erin- Some new, less dramatic, Hot female friends..after all this time..all i've ever asked you for was a hot girl..come on ERIN! For Kevin C.- An easier way to a million For Katie- A better life than the one we've grown up with, the ability to throw garbage in the garbage, wealth, success and happiness..someday For Dad- A clue For Sarah- A horse For Lauren- Signs, Fire in the sky, Independence Day, and the Alien trilogy on DVD...beats rocky! For Ashley- NOTHING UNTIL I GET MY DAMN DVD BACK For Frank- Marie For Phil- Well if erin got any hot girls, i'd share one with ya..a sane one for once For Markle's Lauren- An idiots guide to understanding JB, and an invisible dog fence..so he wont disappear as much For Addie- a 4.0 For Beavis- a new nickname For Jess- reality that i DONT hate you ;) For June- Hair to cut For Malena- Less Hair that you have to cut For Joey- A few hundred grand TAX FREE Last but not least FOR ME- a clean car, a girl thats sane+iintelligent+beautiful+mature, A new computer, 2 million dollars in cash, a manhattan penthouse, a Cali Beach house, lots of beer, a great time this semester, luck, and happy stuff. For you( yeah you..the person reading this)- Close your eyes real hard and think of what ya want..and for that one second you have it..maybe its only in your mind..but for a second..it was yours. NOW..think of how nice the thought of having it was....Guess what? Thats your motivation to take hold of life...get that one thing ya want..make your life what you want it..play this game, play it well and win. Remember, the world is yours..shape it how you want it. Do what you want..when you want..its your life..Don't you forget it.

      First and foremost...fuck you fags who are still crying about me leaving the frat.  Your own brothers are sick and tired of hearing it too..3 words for you about life..it goes on..Get over it.  Put that in your fucking profiles.  Maybe then someone may actually feel bad for you.  It has been over a month already, i've seen people get over the fact that their wives left them in less time.  If you're crying cry away..i'll be enjoying life, drinking some beer, and having fun as usual.  I am flattered however that I'm on your mind this much.  So Dave, Mark...whoever..thank you for making me feel damn special. To conclude this section of my public service announcement for anyone still whining about it is:"Cry me a river, dickwad." Let bygones be bygones..suck it up.    Anyway..oh there goes my alarm..as usual though I woke up minutes before it. I don't feel much like packing right now..but who is ever excited about packing to go back to school anyway?  THe AGONY OF PACKING... "How do i fit all of this in my car?" "I cant believe i have to leave this beer behind" "I don't want to carry all this damn stuff up the stairs!" "You mean i have to go OUTSIDE when its still light out?" "How can I pack this so it doesnt get wrinkled?" "Should I take both of my pillows?" "Take the coffee pot, or leave it?" "MY LAUNDRY STILL ISNT DONE"  See its not easy being in college..so many tough problems to solve..lol now if that isnt sarcasm, i dont know what is.  I went to the woodlands last night..had a great time with Sarah, Ray, Mr. Cella and ESU PD officer Volch.  Had 2 new drinks...a gatorade(lime vodka and 7up) and a jolly rancher(Peach Schnapps and cranberry). Normally I wouldnt get sissy drinks but given that it was happy hour(for 3 hours)..they put bottom shelf liquor in their drinks so anything where you could taste the liquor was terrible to drink.  I just turned to my left and saw my boot which got some jolly rancher on it because some ignorant ass girl kicked over 2 of our drinks, which weren't in her way, and i stepped in that..and spilled some stuff on my shoe too cuz i had to hold other people's drinks AND try to drink my own at the same time..while being half in the bag. Later on they bought me some shots of something..and then we left...I couldnt even feel the cold when i left.   Today I actually left the house before the sun was setting...and the sun burned my eyes! AHHH..no more..must go back to darkness.. enough of what i did..that gets boring to read..not saying anything else doesnt..but if you dont like it..dont read it!  Coming soon to WB: Club Underground..the newest indy music/wrestling venue. God only knows what kind of fun thats going to bring. Congrats to Joey and his right hand man Brad for bringing this together and bringing back our underground family.  I'm not going to spill anything else about that because I think the fans should be in suspense...  I'm too tired to pack....but i guess i have to. So i'm going to stop writing now...less than one day before the madness of college begins again..cant wait!

      I think maybe a year or two if you asked me what I wanted..i would have had an answer-Especially when it comes to girls.  Now, i dont know what the fuck is going on in my head.  Right now i'm at some odd point where I dont know if i can be serious about relationships. My life has changed a lot, and things have been extremely crazy..but this stands out the most in my past relationships.  Girls have my head spinning anymore..sometimes i just feel sick from it..like when you spin around in a circle till youre all dizzy and shit. I just dont know whats going on..i'm lost in a way..I I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT I WANT..NONE...i dont know what kind of girl i want...what kind of relationship i would fit into..or even if i CAN be in one at this point in time.  This isnt an attempt at venting or anything..I just figured that maybe if i wrote about it, I would get a better perspective.  I think maybe its that i'm so emotionally beat from all the shit i've been through with girls.. I'm just fucked up..lol It could be that i've hit THAT POINT in my life..the one most guys reach...where I just want to chill, be stress free, relax, and do my own thing.  Eventually I guess I will want something serious..i just dont know.  Guys, Women are evil...dont ever ever ever believe that a girl is simple, pure, or innocent. Those three words are reserved for babies..and nothing more.  Girls always used to bitch to me about "getting played". Lets be honest here...guys, we're just pawns in their game.  Woman's enemy isnt men..their biggest problem isnt men either. Its other women.  If 2 best friends like the same guy..a girl would sell her grandmother, her pet chimp, and her left nipple to get the edge over her friend.  The funny part about all of this is that somehow..in the end...they always make it the GUYS fault. Well ya know what i say about that? FUCK THAT.. thats bullshit.. women arent the victim in most circumstances... Their game just doesnt go as planned, and they turn their guns on the cock they were chasing.  I sit and chill in my room alot..when i'm not lifting or eating or going to class.. I think its just because i want to avoid the drama..i'm beat..i need a fuckin break. I wont get one though, and part of me is OK with that. I love attention from girls..I love how girls want to bone me.  My life on MTv would=ratings lately! Alright enough of the women stuff..bottom line..i dont know wtf is going on in my head..and i won't until the merry go round stops spinning and i get off.  Hmm..lifting..yeah..i've gotten alot bigger..I have started to increase my gym days to four and I take a ton of protein and weight gainer. I'm really pumped about wrestling coming back and it's pretty much my ONLY focus right now.  I just want to look good..and I dont think the girls will complain about that either.    It's friday night..i'm beat..so i'm not going out, BUT..i am going to wal mart...need some dvds..  Oh yeah..and girls..guess what!!! Mating season is on its way again...its almost spring..that means youre going to want to bone even more.  Sign up sheets will be on my door ;) For a good read, check the archives of this journal for an entry about mating season last march i think.  Peace..and happy boning. -John

      One of main things that drives me and determines many of my future decisions and actions is loyalty. Something occured today that reminded me how important loyalty is to me.  I'm not sure exactly when I've picked up such a strong conviction and belief in loyalty. Usually I can trace back my personality aspects or flaws to some occurence in the past.  This however, is a mystery.  I can't figure out for the life of me where this one comes from.  Loyalty is perhaps one of the only things i'm extremely emotional about. Just thinking about the past year..there were a few instances within a group i was involved in since I came to ESU where i trusted all of the members with something...which was supposed to be kept between us due to bonds of brotherhood.  On more than one occasion members saw fit to break that loyalty and it affected my life.  Later, that caused me to doubt my own loyalty to the organization and ultimately leave it. I guess from that example i gathered 2 things: 1.I'm only as loyal to someone or something to the same degree of loyalty they have to me 2.A break in that loyalty eventutally causes me to react to it  I think that maybe loyalty is a big factor to me because i'm a skeptical person about this world and really i'd rather have a loyal group of people i can confide in and trust in with my life, rather than have 5million friends and be prom king. Loyalty is a big issue in the mafia...like goodfellas..never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut..theyre words to live by. If a mafia style culture ruled all of this world, trust wouldnt be an issue, respect wouldnt be non existant, and loyalty would be a watchword for all of us.  Now..if youre reading this and wondering why i wrote this and what its supposed to mean...i guess you should think about it this way... when no one else was there, when no one else had the answers, when everyone else was too busy to care, there are people you turn to for help...and they gave it..without motives or anything...you trusted them and they kept whatever it was safe....in my mind..to them you owe your word..you owe respect..your payment is loyalty(but not EVERYONE deserves it)..its something hard to find in this fucked up world..its not something you can buy...Its some kind of security in this ever changing, cold society we live in.  Boys and girls, Loyalty is my safety net and what gets ME through it all. What about you?

      I'm not too sure what's going on in my head lately as you've probably understood from the last journal entry..BUT you may have caught on to the idea that there is ONE constant in my life..one thing i believe in and work for right now: My body.   I THINK...now..its possible I won't feel this way on any given day..but I THINK that i'm about to put nearly all my focus into my body.  Now, don't get the wrong idea..I've been focused.   I've religously spent four days a week at the gym. On mondays and wednesdays,I weekly alternate between two different lifting programs customized for professional wrestlers and on Fridays and Sundays I run a few miles and then follow that with some concentration lifting.  I think though that its time to kind of shut out any emotions or activities that might fuck up my focus in the gym.  One thing i'm considering cutting down on even more, or even eliminating is drinking. Don't take that the wrong way..its not for a moral reason, a self control test, or anything of that sort, its purely physiological.  As you probably know, I LOVE drinking...its one of my favorite past times but lately I have cut down considerably.  Many factors have contributed to that. Among those are how shitty the ESU party scene has become, and possibly my age...But i think i'm just about willing to do whatever i need to in order to keep my body prepared to lift. Also coming up, I will be in the ring, working off the rust, honing my skills and working on some new moves and things..so really I dont think I will have much time available to feed the alcohol beast within.  I have several big projects to work on for school too, so i think pretty much..there won't be many drunken stories in here.   I'm sure there will be a few exceptions..ya gotta let loose sometime..but my #1 vice so to speak..is going to be the gym. Lately it has been good to hear that people notice my hard work.  A "brother" of mine, Phil, pointed out how my size has doubled since we've returned to school.  I guess thats a measure of accomplishment to me..when people notice and let me know.  Well lets see if i can keep this mindset... My luck i'll end up looking like an unmotivated jackass and end up partying like a fuckin star again this week..ahh..life..cant complain about it too much..its just great to be alive sometimes..and to be human. Other times..of course..it seems better to be a rock..or a piece of pizza.  Peace.

      I decided to remove the single post because it was poorly written when I was pissed of at some people for some thing that happened. Instead, i decided to replace it with a post that meant more to some people. Those "some people" being the girls who have asked me what I am looking for in a girl. I opened up askmen.com for the first time in awhile and noticed an article about "the girl next door" and I decided to use this as part of my entry because it helps describe some of the things that I cant explain so well when someone asks me the question. The full article text can be found at  urlLink http://www.askmen.com/dating/dating_advice_100/111_dating_tips.html .   Most guys are attracted to the all-night, uber-party girl. But eventually, our focus shifts toward someone with whom we can settle down. Typically, we look for the wholesome, naturally pretty, more demure female who we've come to know as "the girl next door." Somehow she embodies all of our more mature and tamer instincts: marriage, children and tender companionship. The main difference in our thinking is that her qualities are just as important to us as her looks.    This is something I agree with. Though most guys fear the words "marriage" and "children", we reach a point in our lives when we just cant keep up with the wild, ultra social type of girl.  After years of virtually  nonstop clubbing partying, we realize that there is more out there in the world to do.  It's hard to enjoy life if youre not concious for most of it.  Yes, we still do enjoy going out and partying, but not as often.  This change doesnt come at a certain age. For me, I just got worn out from all the crap GIRLS have put me through over the years. We  get sick of the club and party girls. You can only have so many hook ups before sex loses its emotional meaning, so many guys at this point in life will often go out just to hang out with their friends.  The crazy, wild party girl, who once was "the guys" dream girl, now is seen as unmanageable.  Guys at this sort of turn around point stop looking at girls JUST for sex and begin looking at them from a potential dating viewpoint.  The "wow, she has a nice rack, i'd bang her" changes to "wow, she has a rack, i'd bang her, but there's no way i'd date a girl like that."   Men's relationship attitude change as well. Before this point in a mans life, he feels like the world is his for the taking and doesnt want to be tied down by just one thing.  Once this point comes men realize that just like anything else, its nice to have a girl to call his own.   When evaluating potential girls for a relationship, guys at this stage take into consideration every aspect of the girls personality and social interactions as well as her looks.  Guys have all sorts of views about how their 'perfect woman' should act in every situation. Generally, guys don't want a girl that is overly socially active with guys, a girl that gets attention but doesnt thrive on it, and a girl who would have strong loyalties to her man.  The AskMen.com article lists qualities of the type of girl that guys at the settling down stage are seeking.    There are so many characteristics of the girl-next-door type that qualify as "good" or virtuous. These are things we've come to look for in a woman, which earn the respect of our male sensitive side.    She's a homebody . She cooks, cleans and is not afraid of being at home, helping out with chores. Plus, she's not a fan of clubbing. She thinks the nightclub scene consists of horny drunks and game players who don't live honestly. And after all the not-so-great game players you've dated, this is a refreshing, alluring and potentially life-altering change for your dating scenario.    Bingo! Without a doubt, this is the type of girl you dont think you would ever have an issue trusting. Someone settled is important especially if you've dated girls who seek large amounts of freedom while in relationships.     She's nurturing and sweet.  Unlike so many of the women you've dated who had militant stances against being nice to you simply because you were a man, she's understanding of your needs and is willing to take care of you when you're sick. Her sweet demeanor -- and knowing that what goes around comes around -- makes you want to be with her and take care of her in kind.    Reality Check:Guys have feelings too, and having a girl that can not only find them past the macho guy defenses, but can also tend to them, is important.     She doesn't attract attention.  She's "under the radar," so to speak. Guys won't hit on her everywhere you go; not because she's unattractive, but because she prefers to remain low-key, both in her appearance and her attitude. She's neither a flirt nor is she flashy; but she has that natural beauty that doesn't require coats of makeup.    If you didn't know it already, when it comes to having a girlfriend, guys hate other guys. It's not a matter of jealousy, its that we're guys and we know how many happy relationships we have screwed up. We are evil and we are aware that other guys are as well.     She's predictable and safe.  What you see is what you get. You'll always know where you stand with her, as well as where she stands on any given topic. There's no guesswork involved and that makes her a welcome change from all the women who've played head games with you before.    Again when it comes time to trust and have faith in a relationship, you need something constant day to day to trust in. Women with as many personalities as fingers should never be trusted.     She's low maintenance.  This is one of her best qualities. You won't have to constantly buy her jewelry and other such gifts to keep her interested. She even enjoys just slumming-it for a night in or out with you. Jeans and a T-shirt are fashionable enough for a stroll around town. But here's the kicker: when the occasion calls for it, she dresses to the nines.   At this stage guys want girls to look past the way we dress and the car we drive, because we know that the biggest scumbag can shop at Express for men. Girls that constantly worry about not being dressed up properly and are always worrying about how they look can become EXTREMELY annoying.  When you're running to dunkin donuts, you shouldnt have to wait a half hour for your girl to do her makeup, ITS DUNKIN DONUTS!     She has family values.  Because she comes from a solid family upbringing, she believes in the importance of family. If you ever want to be a dad, this is the woman you want as the mother of your children.    Guys who want a family need a girl who they can see as a mother.     She has a good personality.  Although this is not something you'd want to hear about someone you're meeting on a blind date, the girl next door is easygoing and able to joke around with you about all kinds of topics. You can go anywhere with her and never get annoyed. She doesn't complain, but she does speak her mind honestly and with respect for your feelings.    Guys need a girl they can relate to and have a conversation with. Guys at this stage like to be able to have fun with their girl almost like she is one of his friends. In fact, she should be a friend and a whole lot more.  Not being annoyed by a girl is important too, because a guy won't be able to settle down with someone he can't stand.      She's trustworthy and reliable.  You can take her word to the bank. If she tells you she is going to do something or be somewhere, it's set in stone. You could give her your credit cards and never worry that she'll overspend. Now that's a headache you'll be glad to avoid.    Again, theres that "T" word. If a guy wants to be long term with a girl, he has to be able to almost trust her with his life. Girls should learn to be honest no matter what!   Now..This all sounds a bit idealistic. I am a bit idealistic, so thats probably why this article had such an appeal to me.  So is there such a girl? If you find a girl like this, is it too good to be true? Are you being played? I've been there before..it SUCKS, your world ends up crashing down and you forget who you are for awhile....TEMPORARY INSANITY ensues.  A final quote from Askmen.com  She might be playing you . The worst possible thing to discover is that this was all an act. She really is that wild child party girl who sucked you in with the "nice girl" facade, and all of a sudden, you're back playing the same relationship games that drove you to her in the first place.       Theres what i'm looking for..there is your answer! Happy?!

      Yeah..I lost my post..i'm a dumbass. I started writing the post on St. Patricks day and finished it three days later, but I had a post. I went to publish it, but since it was sitting there for three days, it needed to refresh the connection with the posting site and I lost everything.  My dumb ass didn't copy the stuff out before hitting the button, so I lost it. 2 words.. Oh Well.  To summarize that one and move on to bigger and better things, The post was mainly about how something happened where I decided to look back on the last three years of my life. I listed many of the important events and decisions I made over the last three years and in doing that, I realized how fast life moves.  You have to make every moment count and bla bla bla...Here is all that matters now but tomorrow yesterday when you look back you want to be able to have things that you want to remember.  Anyway, on to more important things. The wvZOO has opened, not officially though. Grand Opening is the end of April/first week of May. For those of you who don't know what The Zoo is, it's not a zoo at all. There are all sorts of indie bands all over the place. That's how most bands other than "Da Band"(which isnt even a band) start out playing. The Zoo is now one of these places where these bands can get a start. Don't ask me who, because I have no clue about the bands, I'm not there for that. I'm there to assist Joey and Brad whenever they need help running things and security and all that. There's also another reason i'm at Zoo a lot. After almost three years of not wrestling because of whoever and whatever...i'm going back to it.  By the way, fuck you if you don't like that..I honestly dont give a shit. I dont laugh at you because you're a pussy. Now the building that The Zoo is housed by is going up for auction, so hopefully either the new owner buys back his own shit, or the new owner keeps at least The Zoo intact. Its an awesome place, and its good to be around my real brothers..If there's anything close to being a real fraternity, and real brotherhood, it's the guys that have been involved in wrestling and the underground since it has started.  There's even pledging..but it's wrestling training, where you basically get the shit beat out of you for months..literally. One of the trainees had a fist size bruise on his back.  I'd like to see half of these so called greeks at esu go through something like this.  Oh yea..and we don't do community service..we'd rather beat the shit out of each other for charity than help and old lady cross the street like the face version of Superstar Brian Charisma.  Ok..out of that bubble..I don't know where my life is going day to day right now. Thats alright too, because i'm really getting into this living day by day shit.  In living my life, i piss people off..and i'm glad, because that means I'm real. As Pimp Daddy Ice T said last nite in his spoken word thing, you aint gonna make everybody happy...everyone wants to be happy and it overlaps with someone else's  trying to be happy, so its gonna piss them off.  BINGO.. hey if you dont like what I do..how i run my life..how i make my money, whatever.  If you think i should "just graduate already," good for you bitch..i think you should choke on a fucking dick.  I do what i feel fits my life. See that..MY LIFE.  Don't like it..aww cry me a river...I just DON'T CARE.  Oh well..its lunch and then gym time..I'm not gonna sit here and write more just so you have something more to read. Why?..because I JUST DON'T CARE!1

      The Woodlands+Open Bar+Sorority Chicks=OFF THE FUCKIN HOOK.  Remember how you hated proms and semis in high school? Yeah..me too.   Going in to this whole sorority formal thing I expected to hate it as well.   I've been sleeping all day. I gag at the thought of alcohol. Why? Because I partied all last night and partied hard.  The AST formal last night was incredible. I danced. Let me repeat that. I danced. I wasn't even playing a Teen Icon or anything. John danced.  Ya know what was wrong with all those proms and crap that you hated? There wasnt an open bar. Now of course the night had its drama, because well, in case you forgot, a sorority is a group of GIRLS. Beyond the tears, the little spats, the dirty looks...i  think MOST of the girls had a great time. The food was actually good too, which is surprising. The whole thing started at 7, I drank 7&7's, long island ice tea's and more 7&7's, I sang something, danced, and brought down a funnel.   The funnel was a good time as usual, and after that came the after party. I would probably have ended up skinny dipping but the pool was closed.  We went from room to room, and continued to drink.  At some point we ended up in a room where a KDR guy stood there and gave this 45 minute speech on how he hates acacia.. Then KDR dude left and about 2 minutes later, Craig from acacia came in and gave an hour speech about how he hates KDR.  The night was just insane! I had an awesome time. Big thanks to Sarah for taking me, and AST for partying hard and hardly sleeping. I think this was one of the best party nights in a long long time and I needed it!  Oh yeah, appparently my name is Daddy Big thanks to AST pledge jenn. Who knows?!  What a crazy fucking night..words cant do it justice. The sun burned my eyes in the morning.   Must do this formal thing again. Back to not drinking for a little. :)

      My focus in life right now is clear. It's all about wrestling.  How I eat, sleep, and everything I do during the day somehow revolves around wrestling.  This is directly related to the fact that i lift so i can look really good for wrestling. I treat lifting like a religion. I'm a meat head anymore..and i like it. Getting involved in lifting is one of the most productive things i've ever done. I love how i feel when i get done lifting...I love the compliments..i love people calling me "the hulk" or "a beast" because it actually means people are noticing my hard work. Lifting is life right now. To the big picture...Wrestling. You're reading this, so you're going. Its May 2nd at the ZOO in WB(wilkes barre, PA for all you jersey pricks). If i know you, youre going. Its only 8 bucks. The new TEEN ICONS will be debuting against The Hardcore Mafia. Its gonna be a great tag match and I hear the Teen Icons are something you just Don't want to miss. If youre from ESU..yeah its the start of finals week, BUT give up a few hours and come see me do what i love to do.  Most everyone i know well at esu, i have given advice to and help..now this is your chance to give back to me.  I'll put a link to a good flier in my profile once its available online and my away message will tirelessly advertise the event. Wrestling is something i've been waiting to do again for well over two years. There's no better time to re-debut than the Debut show of the Valley Wrestling Alliance. You're going to see wrestling like you've never seen before.  If you love me..come get an autograph. If you hate me..come yell shit at me. I dont care..just be there.  Now to close this crappy entry, Tony asked me last night if i would rather lift or have sex. The truthful answer to that is lift.

      It's nice to know the things I do for people are appreciated. I just got an email this morning from someone i was really close to.  Someone that put me through so much pain.  In the email, she apologized for alot..she sent me the lyrics to a song which applied to her side of the situation. It meant alot to me because its always nice to get an apology and ontop of that its REALLY nice to feel appreciated for once.  I do or have done so much for so many people in the past, but have receieved little appreciation at all. At times in the past i've been a sap..i was too nice. I've corrected the problem though...i dont spend to much time mending anyone elses life anymore..hell i've become pretty self centered. I just want to make myself happy anymore. Sometimes that means I have to do things that arent "right" or things that may hurt other people..and so fuckin what, right? I mean..it's my life, i'm not here to make everyone else happy. I'm here for me, and like Ice T said...there's no way in hell youre going to be able to make everyone happy. So i make me happy. And i am happy. I have some really good friends that i consider blood.  I'm in good health, I have fun. Maybe if i were rich..that would help..but hey..money isnt everything to me. I know i'm rambling..i dont care I lost my Ecard and had to blow 15 bucks on another one. I'm such a dumbass sometimes.  I had what i would call a pretty shitty day yesterday but it ended up being good after i got some work done and talked to some key people...who totally turned my day/night around.  aside from those parts of my life...  WRESTLING MAY 2nd SEE ME FOR TICKETS THIS COMING WEEK and..visit  urlLink The Teen Icon Zone  and  urlLink WBzoo.com  for more info.  GO..or dont ever talk to me again!  Peace

      I've repeated this phrase so many times since i went away to college that i figured it's about time to write a post about it.  College is work, tests, group projects, living in a room as big as a closet, sleep deprivation, eating food not meant for human consumption, being broke, paying too much money for books, falling asleep in class, getting sick every two weeks, living a few feet from people you'd normally never speak to, packing your car to the point you cant see out your rear view mirror, and carrying basically everything you own up 3 flights of stairs and then 4 months later back down the stairs.   Now thats the stuff people bitch about in college, but i definitely have to say...college is a magical, special place. It's like a disney land for those nearing adulthood and those who just wont let go of being a kid(like me). At college, things happen that people either "only could dream about"...things that never in a million years could a person see happening or even doing.  I'm going to try my best to write about those things in list form. Here goes:   Only in College..  -Will you end up having sex with two or more people in the room...while those 2 or more people are awake. -Do you go back home on a 10 minute break, chug a beer and then spend the rest of class smelling like corona -will you drink so much that fat girls appear skinny -do you feel comfortable pissing in front of people..even large groups -will you piss on cars, dumpsters, or in the middle of the quad proclaiming "i'm king of the world" -would you sell your soul for a 'free' tshirt or a keychain -would you wear a shirt that says "got crabs" because its free -will you trade a beer for a TV dinner -will you pay $5 for all you can drink really bad beer -will you encourage your girl friend to show her boobs for beads -will you encourage your best friend to feel your girlfriend's boobs -will you wear the same jeans 3 days in a row, to a party and then for 2 more days -will you budget whatever money you do have for a case of beer at the end of the week -will you not have a clue where you are after drinking the night before -will you drunk IM instead of drunk dial -will you ever find the true meaning of the words natty, beast and key -will "my bad,i was so wasted" be accepted as an apology -will you use beer pong as a measure of manhood -will you leave a party if you lose a game of beer pong -will you drink everclear -will you willingly become an alcoholic -will you do the worst thing possible just because its fun and because you can -will you smoke weed in public and not care -will you recreationally break things and not give a shit -will you sell your body for beads, dress up like a cat, wear tapered jeans and a nintendo shirt, or wear a white shirt so people can write on you, all at parties -will you take one for the team..whether there's a team around or not -will you wait in line for 20 minutes just to piss -will you learn to drive drunk well -will you forget your name, your age, and where you live, all in the same night -will you have sex in a public shower -will you get drunk, puke everywhere, pass out, then be proud of it in the morning -will you get extra sleep so you can party harder tomorrow -will you have some of the best times of your life.  College is great. Many people have alot to bitch about, but ya know what..stop being miserable, stop bitching, grab a beer, and ROCK ON.. NOW is when you make your memories that you'll never tell your kids.   If you're still in college, make the most of it!

      I'm going to get to the title of this in a little bit but first, i'm going to bore you with my finals week. VWA on Sunday was a huge success, and the Icons are definite heels in the mix. The crowd was very receptive to the show as a whole which was awesome. I've never been a bunch of nerves as after intermission.  I was in the back preparing for my match, and it hit me. We had two matches and then we would be on.  I was an excited kind of nervous I guess.  Up until the point where we cut the curtain I was running around like a nut. Just as the notes hit in Take on me, we cut the curtain, and the nervous feeling disappeared. John was left behind the curtain and JS came through. It was a great, fun match and it was awesome interacting with the fans on that scale. The fans were so into it. I never had the pleasure of working with such a crowd. Frank even made me and dan a poster that featured SNL's ambiguosly gay duo. It's great to be back in the ring!  Monday started the real 'fun' that went through friday.   That 'fun' included: 	-a presentation on a 16 page term paper 	-a full working web page and a presentation on the web page 	-a full working database and a presentation on it 	-a security certification document(which turned out to be 250 pages) 	-a cultural geography final(which ended up taking only 10 minutes to complete) 	-packing 	-more packing 	-carrying stuff to my car After all that fun was done and over with it was off to NYC, where I lost my case to fight my ticket. I think seeing all the half wit retards in court was well worth the trip, because of course the hearing room is open to everyone fighting things and i had the opportunity to watch the judge belittle so many morons. It was like watching judge judy live and in person.  Then the judge belittled me, cut my fine in half(but with a full surcharge of 50 bucks) and then I was on my merry way.   My trip to NYC included too much Jersey than I could handle. Hoboken sucks, Paterson sucks, Newark sucks, it all sucks. I got to ride my first ferry though.  We accidentally found the weehawken ferry.  The trip back from jersey was the longest car ride in the world. When that came to an end, it was more packing, more cleaning and then getting the FUCK out of ESU for a few months.  Hours upon hours of unpacking followed.  The ceiling fell a few times..that was my friday. Nice huh?  Well the semester is over and its about time for some hindsight comments, but that will come later. First, I want to touch on the title of this post. During setup staturday night, something occurred, and Brad C. made the comment, "just goes to show ya johnny, the more things change, the more they stay the same."  He couldnt be more right.  I mean, there will be those little things all around that change and wont ever be the same again, but, for the most part, much of life remains concrete. The biggest thing that comes to mind: My family, my kliq. We've all gone off and done our separate things...Ray and I went off to school, Joey started a business, Brad stayed at Domino's, Jeff suck with wea, Volch worked at a prison, Heather is at PSU, Louie is teaching at WA.. but really the glue that keeps us a family is still there.  If we got together tomorrow and hung out, we'd all be the same people, and we would pick up like nothing has changed at all.  The kliq is extremely important to me, because it's  the one thing that withstood the test of time.  Time is killer.  I know that no matter what else goes on in my life, my kliq, my family will always be there...and i can count on them. Besides the kliq though, there's so much else around me that hasn't really changed a bit. Think about your own life for a minute..it's true.  Now i'm going to go to some semester shout outs. It's impossible to recount, thank, bitch, scold, and laugh at everyone and everything but i'm going to try my best. So here goes.  Joey, Brad Cand Jeff: You guys made it happen, you made all of our dreams come true with The Zoo. You guys are my blood until the end.   Joey, as you said it has been you and I from the beginning. I'm so proud of you man. Watching you succeed brings a tear to my eyes...it's like watching my little brother win the lottery. Brad C, I think when you and I put our minds together we've accomplished so much and will continue to.  We always come up with the best ideas at 4am.  Thanks for being there at 4am during my hard times this semester to listen about crazy girls and whatnot.  I'm proud of you with the straight edge thing..extremely proud.  Allthough i couldn't imaging my own life without alcohol, I respect the willpower it takes to do such a thing.  Jeff, Man it has been forever, from the days on main street, to samurai blades and ex girlfriends, to the vacuum cleaner hose, to Iron Chef/Jim Beam Black Saturdays, we've been through alot of life.  Great job with the zoo, even though i'm sure people got short tempered with you, they don't realize if you had a little less patience than you had with them, you would have killed them all.  Volch:You are insane. Thats for the most part a good thing. You've done some of the craziest shit ever, you have some of the best stories..dude, youre still alive an it amazes me. You will forever go down as a legend in my eyes.  Heather: Thanks for the supplement advice this semester, sis.  I hope everything goes well with grad school in florida.  Thank you too for listening to my stories with all my crazy girls.  Ray: I dont know how you didnt kill me fall semester.  Me and Frank grilled you guys hardcore.  This semester, thanks for not killing me during my drunk moments where i would walk in at 5am and call you a jew or something similar.  Tony: Cool shit having you as a roommate man.  Glad we got away with it and didnt get kicked out.  Aside from the compulsive channel flipping, there are alot of great memories from this year.  They include, "tony wake the fuck up and take a shot", Stealing pizza from 2nd floor, and making fun of Kevin nearly every night at 3am.  Don't be throwing cups, we're not coming to Jersey to bail you out!   Kev C: Man you went through so much shit since christmas. Things are getting better man and i'm glad to see that.  Stick in there!  Awesome time partying wit you this year. When I first met you, you didnt do much of that, but its been crazy hanging with you.   Just 2 things I want you to remember: 1.Shut the fuck up and lift 2.Take the Bacon out of your pocket She's a 10 on the drunk scale so shes AT LEAST a 6 sober  Kevin D: Dude congrats on your weight loss. Glad to see how motivated and dedicated you have become. I cant wait to work with you in training. You already have something that we cant teach...and thats heart.  Come June, it's on like Donkey Kong BIOTCH!  Brad R: Looking forward to next semster and the tiki bar.  You are a human drinking machine. You make me proud, son...lol Let's keep making them ACACIA boys cry, it's what we do best.  Phil: First your boyfriend leaves, now you!  Great times this semester..THANKS for making me chug all that Bacardi! DICK...lol   Enjoy being away from ESU. Congrats from getting away from the ex too.  Markle: It has been a pretty busy semester, didnt get to hang and get wasted all that much, but we have a year left.  STOP BREAKING SHIT YOU CRAZY FUCK...lol  We've had some of the best times at ESU, hope all goes well with the girl and everything else.. Markle Fest this year??????? hahaha  Francis: Yous motha fucka.  It wasnt the same without you around. You missed alot of good times, but i'm sure ya don't miss ESU. You gotta come party more next year, and of course, iron my clothes.  Thanks to all you guys above who came to wrestling, it meant ALOT to me.  Erin: Havent seen too much of ya girl, I miss you.  I hope your golf carting is going well.  I hope this year we can party some more, and i cant fucking wait till you finally can come out for parade day. Thats 2 years in the making. If ya ever need anything, you know how to reach me.  June: Its nice to have ya back in PA. Thanks for coming to the show:) You're the third person i have to thank for listening to my crazy girl shit. I don't know what I would do without you and the others who have helped me. Oh yeah, I would go completely nuts.  Kayla:  The beginning of the semester sucked, and it sucked hardcore. You know why.  I'm glad after everything though, i can still be friends with you and not hate you. Really, that takes alot, but youre an interesting person to have in my life to say the least. You're unlike anyone i know.  Just TAKE MY ADVICE FUCKHEAD ;)  Addie:  You and I fight so damn much..we might not get along all that much but youre a cool girl, no doubt.  Good luck with the new guy, hopefully you didnt pick a loser like last time.  Markle's Lauren: Hope school went as well for you as you deserve. We didnt talk all that much because you've been so busy..I hope you get all A's.  Also good luck with Markle and his wandering...lol  Jamie: You and I are always on this huuuuuuuuuuuuuge rollercoaster. I dont know if or when it will ever end, but it sure as hell keeps my life interesting.  No matter where it stops, we will always have...the cat's room.  Lauren V.: Sorry for causing any shit. It has just been an emotionally fucked up semester. You're a really sweet girl.  Sorry we never got to watch lord of the rings or any ALIEN movies. Again, Sorry.  Kari:  Did ya forget how to IM Me? lol I hope my advice helped you and everyting is going well.  Sarah: You're seriously the nicest girl i've ever met. Thank you for seeing me through so much shit and being so good to me.  BUT...i still have to laugh at you for being an ACACIA rat, doing anthony, and the ACACIA gang bang ;) Thanks so much! Oh, and thanks for taking me to the formal. That was the best party of the semester, hands down.  You better fuckin start training for parade day now. If there's a repeat of this year, we're going to put nails under your tires...hahaha  Katie G-You're insane. I once thought that you were normal, and the way people perceived you was off, but really you are insane.  I cant even talk to you because youre going to go do or say something crazy, or write a whole journal entry about me that's mostly innacurate.  Again, if you want to talk shit, feel free to IM me.   Alexis: Stop looking at my journal, seriously.  You've always thought i hated you, well now its true. You fucked with kevin, I consider that fucking with me.  You lost a good guy, I wish you nothing but misery.  AST: What a semester huh?  Thanks for having such a kick ass formal!  Dan E.: Man, what a great debut. Awesome work! Thanks for all the web help and everything man.  To everyone else at the zoo: Great times guys..its only gonna get crazier from here now that i'm home for the summer. Trainees get READY TO RUN!  Rosh: Thanks for help with the web page, web space, and the gimmick. You've helped me so much in the wrestling world and I really appreciate that man.   I'm sure theres alot more that i could say here, but youre getting bored reading this. If i didnt put something for you and you're offended, im me and i'll edit this and add in something.  It's time for a whole new chapter now: Summer 2004. Let's make some crazy things happen so I have some good material for more stuff here.    Thanks for everything this semester guys, fuck you to all the assholes and psycho bitches that have caused shit...either way..i'm closing this chapter right here right now. Summer has begun.  and now 2 quotes to close: "Sometimes you gotta stop and remember. You're not gonna be young forever. Think smart, have fun, stay true, and don't ever grow up. Don't grow up. Out of all I've learned in life; you always keep your friends close to your heart. 'cause they will help you if you're falling down."-The Ataris  "You cant become if you only say what you would have done"=Len

      There are some things that I have been keeping from everyone for a long time. I've been having a hard time lately dealing with these things, and it is only now that I could expose them.  First of all, as a shock to pretty much everyone that reads this, i'll be moving.  I haven't told my friends, my tag partner, or my kliq either.  My mother has decided to sell our house here, and move with her boyfriend to Avondale, Arizona.  If I seemed at all distant to any of you lately, I'm sorry.  I guess I was just trying to make it easier on you and me to do this.  I've had a million good times here in Old Forge, in PA in general, at ESU..  From crazy nights on the porch way back in the day, to infamous Sopp or Cella house Parties, from Cinco de Mayo to New Years Eve to 4th of July. It's been great. I know that you Jersey fucks will time and time again talk down on PA, but without PA I wouldnt have learned so many things and grown.  I have met many people here, great and not so great. I've made many friends, a few new "family" members and even less enemies. Both good and bad, my time in PA is never going to be forgotten. I had conversations with many people over time about how easy it would be for me to get up, and just leave everything..how nice it would be.  But now that i'm on the verge of doing so, it's harder than I expected.  There are so many things i'm being forced to walk away from. Ya never realize exactly how important things really are until they arent anymore.  I would love to stay in PA..dont get me wrong. But, where would i live? With my grandparents?  I made the decision to go because i think in alot of ways there are so many things here i need to escape, and even beyond those things, there are better economic opportunities for me in arizona for my 2 majors.  Basically with school i'm going to be taking a semester off to get settled in.  I dont know..i'm trying to write a descriptive post of everything that has been going through, but it's hard to cover everything and every emotion. I mean just take wrestling for example. I Finally got the title as assistant trainer..i love training kids,...but now..i have to walk away and leave that..and leave wrestling again. I have to walk away from all my friends both old and new at the zoo, i have to walk away from my friends at school..its almost like dying and being reborn again...to be honest with all of you..it scares the hell out of me..i dont know how i'm going to do it. I'm not sure i CAN start over like this but i know that i have to and in the end it will pay off.  "Miles away no you're never turning back and I just can't wait anymore Miles away nothing left of what we had just when I needed you most you were miles away  when times were tough and you were down and out who was there by your side but now you're gone and I'm so tired of being alone with only your promises  the loneliness just fades away thoughts of you just memories no cryin out for what you're missing time won't forget what you meant to me"-Winger    So i'm sorry to all of you i'm walking away from and out on.   I want to thank everyone for everything throughout my life here. I will talk to you all individually before I go..i have a month left, so that's plenty of time.  I guess now..do me a favor..and think of all the good times we've had together.  Thats what i've been doing for the last month of sleepless nights.  IM me..lets catch up..maybe relive some old times so i dont forget them. I just want to thank everyone for being in my life..dont be a stranger. And lastly Dont take this seriously, because this post is all complete 100% bullshit.  I've noticed alot of people were waiting for an update, so i HAD to post something.  Ontop of all of that..we all skim..we all miss important things when we read..maybe this taught you a lesson.  Lastly I hoped this post would make whoever read this give a thought to what it would be like without me.  I figured it would make for some good IM conversations.  Some of you probably will end up IMming me without reading this whole thing...so then i KNOW i'll get a good laugh when you IM me and tell me goodbye..hahahahah This whole thing was inspired in part by "the late" Andy Kauffman.  The man is truly a genius.  If you don't know who Andy is yet, rent "Man on the Moon" with Jim Carrey.   I'll make a real post sometime soon when i'm inspired enough.  Don't take life too seriously..you'll never get out alive :p

      "I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here"  First of all..thanks to everyone who responded to the last post..let it be the people who read half and immed to ask questions or those who continued to read through and let me know about the tears you shed because of me.  This is the second time i'm writing this post because as we all know, when we have that great entry, we always lose it.  Fucking Life. Lol  Speaking of life...i'm on the verge of another phase. Not a phase as in periodic likes and dislikes, but rather a group of different circumstances, different people and overall a different life.  I got the internship I applied for at a new computer security firm.  Right now I have been given a task of building the technical side of a company ground up, and when I graduate, leading that company to success.  It's a GREAT opportunity..Assuming everything goes as planned. I'll be graduating in May and becoming a Full time computer security engineer. This is a big step..this is it..the REAL WORLD. I've had a taste of it between PA Resources and Windows America, but now this is it..the big time.  This could be my shot at finally making everything i've ever wanted happen. I've worked and fought so hard in life and i'm not about to stop, because maybe it's finally paying off.  Before I do go onto this next phase, i just  wanted to take some time to addess  everyone who was part of my life in any way over the past 5 years.  The past five years have been 5 solid years of learning...learning about technical stuff, learning about life, learning about people... With learning comes pain..and i've had my share of that too. I've gone through so many experiences..i often wonder what people, places, things, ideas, lessons, mistakes, successes and failures i will remember. For one of the first times in my life i'm almost afraid to move on the the next step because i'm afraid i'll forget some important things overall. Whether anything over the past five years has been good or bad, it has all been beautiful..over the last 5 years i've felt more 'alive' than ever.  I always said the purpose of life was just to live...and if thats the case, i've done it well. I haven't always done the right things in the right situations, i havent always made the best decisions, i havent made the worst decisions either, and i havent always done the wrong things in the wrong situations. What will i remember, what will i forget? I'm beginning to believe in fate somewhat, but in the sense that what you do affects your future..even if it's the littlest thing.  Fate perhaps is a map of goals we just cant see, and every single encounter we have from brushing our teeth to relationships, all those things are just little tiny steps..they are the transportation to lead you to your goal.  Will I forget the steps so far...in 6 months, in a year, in 5 years? There isn't much I remember about high school at all..just little things here and there. High school ended a mere seven years ago, and I cant remember most of it..so what of the last five years will I remember..what of the last 2 years? ESU has really been what I needed to learn more about life and people and all that and overall grow up.  I especially want to thank everyone i've met at ESU for the last few years, because they really did a job at defining me. What of it will I remember, I'm going to miss ESU..i'd love to remember more of it than not... But what will my mind choose to keep? will it be the fraternity I was in?  will it be the friends i've made, the girl's i've met? That's something that only the future has an answer for. I am going to live my last year at ESU to the fullest. I'm really going to take in everything and everyone and the whole atmosphere. College is a once in a lifetime thing.  I'm really going to miss it....everything..good..bad..pleasure..pain..all of it has molded my future. It just sucks because i've never had so many people in my life..being those who i know in passing to those i can call blood..and it really is hard because in a few months, there's no way i can possibly keep all of those people in my life.  Saying goodbye to something has never been so hard. I know i'm going to lose a piece of me when this phase is over, but maybe thats exactly what HAS to happen for me to really be ready for the next. I know this isn't a typical post for me if there is such a thing, but i just wanted to take time out to say than you to everyone for the last five years...no matter the person, no matter the circumstance, thanks for being part of my life.  Let's not waste this last year.  If i've had problems with you in the past, oh well..IM me. I dont want to remember anything negative about the people from the last 5 years..if anything i want to remember the good times. So if we've had any problems, still keep in touch this year!!! If we're cool, thats great..don't lose touch! Let's talk..let's hang out..cuz there may never be time for that again!! Let's bullshit, lets bitch about things, ask for some advice.let me help you..i'm not going to have time to do things like this for much longer!  Ya know..I actually like how this rewrite turned out. It's better than the first.   I like how I turned out too..I'm better than the 'first me'. I guess i'm not really afraid of the future..i survived some of the hardest things in the past few years and over all the last 5 years has really not ended badly at all, so for once i have faith in something. I have faith that the future will do the same.  Who would've thought Scarface would have inspired a post like this?!!  I'm closing with my own quote that I used to have for an away... it went something like....  In the future we're gonna look back and talk about the gold ol' days.. Dont forget those good ol' days are now, so make them count.  Much Love -Jdiddy, Oz, Sopp, JS, Stud, T&A, Killer.... aka John

      I left the theater tonight with alot of things filling my head that need to come out to people who care to read them.  Tonight I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  At the end of the movie, from the theater arose an almost anonymous applause by the audience.  That many solid Democrats? Highly doubt it!  I'm a Democrat, I've shared in the anti-Bush sentiment since the beginning of his term.  I wasn't full behind Al Gore, but since I was a registered Democrat, I cast my vote for him.  I was disheartened about the election controversy, and the fact that my first voting experience for a Presidential election ended mixed a scandal which selected the other candidate to be our four year leader.  That's fine though, what's done is done. Although I had not supported Bush at all, I've always made an attempt to understand his role as a politician, and the highest ranking Government official.  I understand how there are conflicting interests and choices have to be made, information has to be withheld, and sometimes even facts have to be skewed in order to keep a peaceful democratic nation.   Publically however, I do believe our President has made mistakes that have hurt the Country, that has taken money from our pockets, our friends and family out of their homes, and freedom away from our lives.  Fahrenheit 9/11 however wasn't for me in the sense that this movie, as I see it, is to create a balance. There are hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people who are undecided about the upcoming election and don't know what to believe.  Fahrenheit 9/11 flat out is propaganda based.  It doesnt tell the whole story, and certainly doesn't give you every angle. THATS FINE.  I'm not an avid Kerry supporter, and I certainly wouldn't take a million dollars in exchange for voting for Bush.  Fahrenheit did what it needed to do, it leveled out the see saw of politics for the upcoming election.  As sad as it may be, most people like to think what they are told to. Whoever bullshits the best to these people gets the vote.  The Bush Administration has taken some extremely large hits due to the investigations, and overall Bush being Bush. Bush's main way to retaliate, is to hit Kerry strong whichever way he can, and to put out as much political bullshit as possible so that he can avert the minds of voters from the turmoil that has occurred over the last 3 and a half years.  He's going to do whatever possible to distract the voters and cover his ass in the lies.  You've seen resignations by directors and high ranking officials, and don't be fooled. Most of those are because, Bush overall will not take the man's way out of dealing with his screw ups, because frankly who is going to vote for a fuck up President?  Bush instead will find a way to shift the blame to one department or another, saying he didn't get the correct information and he acted appropriately.  So here you have the current President of the United States, with a whole team of people to write his lies for him.  Kerry has a team to, but when the GW fuckups are playing in the superbowl against the Kerry team, who do you think has the edge? It's common sense.    In comes Michael Moore, director.  The most i've known about Michael Moore previous to Fahrenheit was that he's that fat dorky guy.  I didn't see "Bowling for Columbine" and had no idea what his political affiliations were. I am extremely happy that someone stepped out and attempted to even the odds for Kerry. That's exactly what this movie is doing. It's reaching out to us, the little people. The people who have been effected personally, emotionally, and monetarily by the past 3 and a half years. He's touching the people who don't have business interests or aren't going to be swayed by promises or bargains with our corporation for support.  Instead, Moore appeals to our human emotions. The other side of the story is shown. I call it propaganda because it's a one sided attack on Bush, and supports Kerry without even mentioning his name.  Perhaps I should say the underlying theme of this movie is "Get Bush Out of Office."  Never is it mentioned that Kerry is the ideal candidate like in the political ads.  However, if people don't vote for Bush, theyre not going to vote for some random independent candidate!!!    What's important about this film, about the political ads, about everything from now until the election, is that we think independently; That we decide whether or not to exercise our right to vote on our own; That if we DO decide to vote, we choose whomever we feel should be President.  We need to think independently. We should not let a movie, an ad, a tv interview, or a letter or email tell us what to do. In America, we're allowed to think and reason, let's do it.  Filter through all the bullshit and all the propaganda.  Don't be a beach ball bounced around by the press! We need to use our personal experiences and thoughts be a meter. We need to think back to 9/11, and over the rest of the last three years, when we choose to vote for someone, or not vote at all    I'm solid against Republicans in office.  I don't have a billion political reasons, and accounts and facts and figures to back up why.  Plain and simple, i'm your everyday person.  I watch the news on and off, I catch some things in the paper, but most importantly, like every other average Joe, i'm affected by my day to day personal interactions the most.  I'm affected by the people I work with, the people I speak to, and the rules, regulations and policies that deal with everyday life. I am a solid Democrat because, simply, I feel that when Bill Clinton was in office, his role as a leader from the business side was inspiring.  I saw money in my pocket, I saw the little guy start to make big money, and i've seen technology and innovation like never before. I saw life overall getting better.  Through the entire war, i've sort of had an external participation in the feelings related.  During the time the infamous 9/11 occurred, I was working as a telemarkenting mentor for the home improvement company, Pennsylvania Resources.  A portion of my job was to make outbound telemarketing calls to procure leads for salesmen, and the other portion was to monitor our callers to ensure compliance to rules and suggest ways to improve. That day on 9/11 we were calling the Pittsburgh area, as PA resources served that market as well as the Harrisburg, Williamsport, and Local Northeast PA. Around 9am, the staff was given their first break. We were having a slow day, so they asked me to go on the phones and get some leads.  I remember putting a lead up on the board, and a coworker from the Data Entry department in hysterics that the country was being attacked. The initial reaction from everyone, the supervisors, was disbelief, and that the plane hitting the trade center was a mistake.    So back to the phones we went, calling the Pittsburgh area, when around the same time the plane hit.  The last woman I spoke to asked me if I had the news on.  "Of course not, I'm on the phone working mam."  "The world is ending," she said. At that point, the entire marketing section of thirty or so people seemed to get the same sort of call, and put down their headsets.  Most of them were elderly people, some from the New York area, and a fear overcame everyone.  The call center was closed right there, and I can remember driving home, looking up at the sky, I think everyone was. One had to sit and wonder, what's next. I think I said a prayer that day, and I don't often do that.  It's no doubt that 9/11 affected all of us. We were all scared, angry, and in awe at that time.  America wasn't going to let this slip, not one bit, and I think on 9/11, one of the reasons we were scared is that we knew it was likely that we something big was going to happen involving our troops.   The first person that came to mind was one of my best friends, Ray.  He just got out of the Marines and was enjoying civilian life.  Would he have to go back?  I know he got aggrivated at the time when people consistently asked him if he would have to go, but I think it's a natural reaction to think oh shit, what if.  What if Ray still had that urge in him to be a Marine...What if they called him and convinced him to go?  As the efforts to start the "WAR ON TERROR" intensified, images of buildings blowing up, fires, smoke, and trails of bombs in the night sky filled the TV.  At this point, the feeling of security sort of came back for us.  There are a very few percentage of people who didnt look at the TV and say, "yeah lets get those fuckers."  We had our military efforts in Afghanistan, even though most of that was kept under wraps.  Then of course, everything shifted to Iraq.  We have all had a sentiment against Iraq from the Gulf War continuing through the present.  We attacked Iraq, and we had that "the good guys win" attitude, but yet didn't take into consideration that to some in Iraq, we weren't the good guys. I remember being in sixth grade, when the first Bush was in office. Our teachers had us making American flags, and there were trading cards out of the troops and artillery. How could we NOT be anti-Iraq?! However, to some overseas, we aren't at all the good guys, and to some at home, we sure as hell didnt win.   As we know with every war, civilian casualties are an issue.  It's an assumed risk sadly. Innocent people in Iraq died, just as innocent people in America died during the 9/11 attacks. It's a sad thing really, because life is precious, let it be an Iraqi's life or an American's life.  We are civillians because we make that choice to be, just as Iraqi civillians do.    We are sort of disconnected from the civillian deaths in Iraq though.  We feel bad, but we don't really let it sink in, because our hand are tied.  Some of us would rather have a million "Enemy" civillians die, than one of our own.   I've come across several people involved in this military mess.  An ex girlfriend of mine, Amy, had an ex-fiancee and two brothers in the military.  I've seen much of what she went through. When shit was blowing up in Iraq, her and her mother and brother who was out of the service would sit and watch the tv, speak to family members and really hurt, because people they loved were over there. I'm lucky enough to not have had to go through that personally, but second hand was pretty scary too.  Aside from Amy, I met a kid named Mike who was going to Iraq, and a friend of my cousins was one of the first to invade Iraq.  An old friend of mine from wrestling was also a Marine. It's amazing that so far, knock on wood, they all came back alive.  During that time I wondered what it would be like if someone i knew died.  What were they dying for anyway?  Basically, when youre at war, you fight to stay alive. Kill or be killed, but on either side, someones going to lose and someone is going to hurt. It's a scary scary thought, we all know at some point our luck will be up. I thought about how difficult it must be to barely know what your son, friend or family memeber, was doing. Is he alive and when is he coming home. I've seen Amy wait and wait and wait for her brother to come back. When these troops do come back, it's not your typical "I missed you celebration." This kind of return is more of a THANK GOD YOU'RE ALIVE celebration.  I've seen war from that aspect, and it's insanely scary.  Now, we're faced with a decision in a few months, and those are some of the experiences and feelings i'm going to take into consideration IF I vote. If I don't vote, will it really matter? Will Kerry do a good job if he gets re-elected? What will happen if Bush remains in office? These are questions I ask myself on a regular basis.  I look around at the things that affect me, I look at the people around me as well and the things that politics and the Country's leadership is having an effect on.    Overall, the point of all this is to keep your eyes open, and throw your X-Ray goggles on too. Don't believe everything you see, don't believe everything you hear, and sure as hell don't be afraid to think for yourself.  We are the people in the next few months that will defined the Country for the NEXT four years.  Don't let me sway you, don't let Michael Moore sway you, you think about you and your personal experiences.  Go see Fahrenheit, but just as you would with campaign ads, take it all with a grain of salt. Be proud to be human, be happy you have free will and dont let anyone or anything take that away from you. Finally, don't ever forget, this is America, this is your Country.  Just as I have had a chance to have my say in this post, you have your chance to have your say too. Don't be afraid to speak up!

       "I thought it was about presents and kisses. I never realized it was just about being with somebody. I guess it's little things like that that make you fall in love, that define you as a person and make your life what it is. Life isn't measured in how many designer outfits you have, or how much money, it's who is in your life that really matters. It's what you do with the people that matter. It's not the drunken nights out at the bar, although they make for intresting stories, it's more than that. It's about waking up next to somebody you love, not being able to envison your life without them, it's about having a real friend to call when you need to talk. Life isn't measured in how much beer you can chug, or how loud you yell at your pledges, it's about love. it really does make the world go 'round."  &nbsp;  You may have seen that as my away sometime earlier today. I think it's a pretty damn good description of love. Most people just don't get what love is..so I used that as my away to hopefully open up some of your eyes.&nbsp; I got that in an email today from a friend. It wasnt one of those chain letters either, it's just an excerpt from a much longer email where someone was trying to convey to me what i've taught them.    &nbsp;  I guess then, I hope someday you all find out what love is like. Many of you will read that above and not understand how a person can feel that way. If you're one of those people, you've never really been in love.&nbsp; I'll fight you on this one too if you think you've been in love and disagree with any of that.    &nbsp;  I dont have a really long entry to post because i'm uninspired for the most part. I'm just going to finish this off with some boring 'whats going on' sort of stuff.    &nbsp;  -Work is crazy..but i love it...look for me securing computers in a home near you..lol   -Wrestling Saturday in Hanover..not really looking forward to this being that its a LONG ass drive and I dont get to play my normal character..which sucks..i'm a Teen Icon Dammit.   -The one good thing about Saturday is that Markle will be there and i'll get to hang out with that crazy fucker. heh at least i'll get a crowd reaction this time.   -I'm getting a cell phone on friday..FINALLLLLLLLLY :)   -I cant wait to get back to school...sad its my last year though   -Thinkin bout having an end of summer party..who's in ?

      Before I get to the main part of this post, I found out some funny news. After reading Radio Matt's away message, I found it amusing that Bam Bam Bigelow would open an ice cream parlor in NEPA..I figured it was some kind of joke. Somehow though, I crossed that thought, with another thought. A few weeks ago I was at tinks on a saturday, which by the way will forever be known as DRAMAday, and someone said to me that Bam Bam Bigelow was there. Finally tonight I read my cousin Pat's away message and it said something about going to Bam Bam's. I decided to hit google up some info, and in return I got several articles revealing that Bam Bam Bigelow, the beast from the east, Dirty asbury park NJ native, has, In fact, opened an ice cream stand in Hamlin,PA appropriately called Bam Bam's. To steal Radio Matt's heat,&nbsp;I wonder why he didn't call it Greetings from raspberry park.&nbsp;  Now..makes me wonder, was he at tinks?  I think if I saw him in person, I would call him a flamer..he has tattoos of flames on his head, but in his drunken state, he may punch me, and then..i would sue and take over the Bigelow family fortune and Ice cream parlor.  &nbsp; My life has been pretty calm this summer...it's almost disappointing. It's just my life taking its usual course though. It's an incessant waves of ups and downs...or calms and storms.. Right now..i'm in the calm on the rise..which is rockin. I've been getting bored lately, which isnt usual for me. In one months time though..school starts again..my official last year..its gonna be one hell of a storm.  The highlight of this weeks social calendar is Volch's 1-week late birthday bash...i'm making the jello shots..should be a blast.  Work has been crazy lately, and alot has been stressin me about it. This is for two main reasons. One is because the future of the company is basically on my shoulders and second, the play and the work don't balance out right now.&nbsp; I try to keep things in balance in life overall, like the ying yang symbol.&nbsp; Chaos in ones life is caused by an imbalance of one thing over another.&nbsp;It seems i'm working too hard and not havin enough fun on the weekends to compensate..its really paying a toll on me. Lately i've been overly edgy, especially when i drink..i'm always tired..i'm just beat overall.  Speaking of the upswing pattern, I got&nbsp;a cell phone, which is awesome. I won't have to send carrier pidgeons now to contact someone. So call or text me &nbsp;:)  I'm not even sure what to expect for this last school year. Everything I expected the previous 2 years turned out completely different. I'm just going into this one without any guesses, just my balls and alot of beer, and i'm ready to tear shit up.  On another subject..this has been my first single summer. I can't say I miss the aggravation of having a g.f, but there are other little things that I miss, like everyone.&nbsp; Maybe this will be the year that I find love, and maybe it won't be..who knows?  I think this post is lacking because i'm lacking anything entertaining to write about..so i'm just gonna bounce.  Peace, Love, and lots of wild and crazy sex. ~Oz

       Sometimes..to get things straight in your life you need to stick a tape in your brain, hit pause, and throw that baby on rewind.   I'm feeling good right now. I've spent the better part of two hours facing alot of things I have buried deep inside because of the pain those things caused me. This included thinking back to memories both good and bad, reading some old letters, looking at pictures, all with a winamp providing me with a random soundtrack to the recollection of the last few years of my life.   In my last post, I spoke about how I felt like I was crashing and losing it, and didn't know how to stop.  I had some free time tonight and after watching the Shawshank Redemption, I was inspired to take this time I had and put it to good use. I realized I had to break free from my prison. "Get busy livin or get busy dying."  What I guess I haven't realized is that for the last few years, I have been alive but, I've been avoiding living...essentially I've been dying the whole time.     Kevin Carey told me the other night when I was near breakdown that I am too hard on myself, as I have mentioned in the last post as well.  After watching Shawshank I realized that mentally and emotionally, I, in a way locked myself in a prison. I've been through alot of hurt, pain, and just overall bad luck in my life, no doubt..but for some reason, I always carried this in a briefcase chained to my wrist...a briefcase of contempt, bitterness, self-pity, pain and remorse.      Tonight, I decided, would be the night to face those pains..because yeah, I went through alot of shit, but that doesnt mean I should have to every day wake up and be affected by the pain.   It hasn't even been directly that the negative emotions have affected me, since the "briefcase" was attached to my wrist, and not my mind or heart. Instead, these emotions had subtle effects on me..almost like they were whispering to me so quietly from inside the "briefcase" that only my subliminal mind could hear them.      So I did what I needed to do, I said, "FUCK THIS" and I went through everything emotionally painful imaginable...I took some huge wire cutters and cut the cuff that was binding the briefcase to my arm..I grabbed the briefcase and tossed it with force into a coffin.  With every tear I shed, every note I read, and every last bit of hurt, I put another nail in the coffin, and now it's closed.   I now have to bury all of this, for good. I would like to do that immediately, but i figure my subconcious and unconcious mind will best put it to rest when i'm asleep. So as of tomorrow morning, I am going to be free of a huge burden.  If you see a different me, don't be surprised, I don't have too much things to carry with me anymore.   I'm as wide eyed about my future now than ever. I'm hoping for the best to come in the future, and I know it's not all going to be easy, but from now on i'm going to face every hardship the same way I finally faced my "briefcase". I have to stand up and face it instead of locking it away somewhere inside.  The only thing left from any future pains should be a receipt saying, nice try life, John says, fuck off.      I know that I have to keep my mind in the right spot, and as long as i'm successful at this I have big things in store for me in life.      I really feel good about myself, i'm 24, about to graduate from college in less than a year, i'm good looking, and most of all, i'm refreshingly different.  I have strong desires, strong wills and a good heart.  I'm going to make alot of money...I'm going to land myself a beautiful wife in the future, and be a great father to kids who I am going to raise to be more succesful than I will already be, and to make things of themselves that I couldnt even imagine.      "It's funny how life turns out..the odds of faith in the face of doubt..camera one closes in..the soundtrack starts..the scene begins..  You're playin you now ...take a bow"

       From life.  I think right now there's so many feelings and things that i've kept inside, pushed aside or chose not to face that all of it is built up somewhere inside and systematically draining me emotionally. Over the last few weeks I have been more short tempered, more impatient, and just feeling wrong overall.  Things just aren't in order in my head. I think it would take some sort of vacation to put everything in order.  I'm kind of afraid what will be come of my sanity if I don't get away from it all and pull myself together.      Aside from that,   Friday I went to the Kerry rally. Old people dropped left and right because of the extreme heat and a lack of water due to poor planning on Scranton's part.  Made for great comedy. As Ray put it, the song of the day was "Another one bites the dust" by Queen. I hope people locally got a better idea of what Kerry's platform is. He really seems to represent a new america..thats what this country needs. Bush took this country and basically made it his whore. Now Whoremerica is laying in the gutter, as people walk by and spit on her.  It's a sad thing that doesn't sit well with me.  I've never been so interested in politics in my entire life. Well..then again..my mother claims that when I was little I would watch Ted Koppel newscasts at nauseum and would be glued to the Tv during a Regan speech, but in hindsight, the one thing on Tv I remember watching the most was Dr. Ruth.  Sex and Politics baby, thats my platform..lol   Just remember, there's not politics involved when it comes to beer.   Last night..there was a WHOLE LOT of beer...and jello shots..and everything else.    It was a great party. I was pretty much the equivalent to a fraternities "social" as I did all the ground work for the people there. It was a good drunken night, topped off with me spouting off some shit to people that deserved it.  I always say..alcohol takes away that little filter that would,  in normal circumstances, make me shut up. This ties in with the first part of this post. I really need to work out whatever the hell is eating a hole in me before I end up being swiss cheese.  I think overall it was a good weekend. I'm just not looking forward much to work tomorrow. There's alot of stress involved in starting a new business and unfortunately there is alot of work being pushed on me since i'm one of only 2 employees of the company currently. Me and my coworker Sarah have been starting to vent to each other more about Maria and this fucking job, so its helping keeping both of us sane. So...if you see me walking slower than normal, thats just the weight of the future success of the company on my shoulders.      I was told last night that i'm too hard on myself. Maybe I need to take that to heart...but really I dont know how. I dont really know what "being too hard on oneself" is...and its possible that I am..I just dont know what that means and how to stop....      Well i'm going to end this post now..and go back to singing Rent and thinking about life.   Keep it real homies.        "One song   Glory   One song   Before I go   Glory   One song to leave behind   Find one song   One last refrain   Glory   From the pretty boy front man   Who wasted opportunity...   Find glory   Beyond the cheap colored lights   One songBefore the sun sets   Glory -- on another empty life   Time flies -- time dies   Glory -- One blaze of glory   Find   GloryIn a song that rings true   Truth like a blazing fire   An eternal flame   Find   One song   A song about love   GloryFrom the soul of a young man   A young man   Find   The one song   Before the virus takes hold   GloryLike a sunset   One song   To redeem this empty lifeTime flies   And then - no need to endure anymore   Time dies"-Rent
