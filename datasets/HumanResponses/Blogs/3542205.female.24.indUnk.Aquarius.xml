      I expunged the reverie of my affection, Anticipating the notion of "us" Desperately, I tried to uncover my thoughts Did you notice my wanting? I sighed, I created a poet, An integration of your persona and mine Not blatant to convey my emotions He's veiled, like you, in my unconscious. Ecstatic, I went mad when you held me close Near me, I distinguished realism and imaginings. With me, reminiscent of the rain, invigorated my soul You were the wanderer I inexorably valued The magic unbelievable My morning prince Sanity.  Came the 5th day minx, Catastrophic! I never imagined. Twinge... Resentment... Dread... Regret... That instant I died unnoticed. In my dissolution's phantasm, I heard your song I tried to hold you for the last time But the deity came and took you away Love won't linger in oblivion. Quondam.  Soon I will be appealing for a resurrection. For now I shall subsist in verve of reality.  Live and Love.  Nevermind.

      The slayer, mean as he can be, vowed surrender. The child, gentle and innocent, pursued vengence. All for a woman of beauty, The exquisite shadow of yesterday's blossoms.  Dear Tomoe,  Could this be jealousy? I know he's mine but his heart belongs to you. Could this be madness? I'm staying with the one I love and forgetting my existence.  All my life, I waited for the recognition, But your memory lingers, Not like his scar that fades away.  I stayed, I endured pain. To the point that i plead for more.  You were his dream.   Dear Kenshin,  I chose to hide away from the past. Your silence was indeed deafening. It hadn't been more painful, I loved you and you left me.  Broken promises of love, unending goodbyes, Those were the years of seeking atonement. I, your other half, waited for the soft sound of the chime.  The battousai I feared most, and the assassin who stole my entity.  Until that day, I still long to see you smile.  A tribute to Watsuki Nobuhiro's masterpiece, "Rurouni Kenshin"

      I am dreaming of this A velvet morning together Your hand holding mine.  I wish for us to share a moonlight Your kisses to shatter my world Your body, intimate and special.  The story draws me near So close that my eyes were forbidden to blink Yet far, as you were impregnable.  He, the magnificent soul, will hold me This is a chance to delay the anticipated hurt I still ache for my euphoria!

       Why did you?    I chose to realize your meaning. I needed to know if you are worthy of my yearning.    How could you?    I had to do it. That was fatal, I admit.    Have you?    Yes, with all my heart. And will, after we part.    Can we?    Wounds will heal in time. By then, all these will end up in sublime.    Should I?    Definitely. I'd rather be a sweet memory.    Then goodbye...    I'm letting you go...    Ditto.

      We danced to the song of animosity You, a stranger; I, a dweller; Distance, our allies. In the ball of patterned hallucination, Distorted wits, Infected passion, We waltzed to the psalm of the stars.  Shielded by the memoir of curses I welcomed fear You renounced vigor Sway away in this innocence. Horrific intuition, Leads this sorceress to beauty Necromancer to majestic To lust and unrestricted copulation.  Immerse him in your body, Drown her in your steamy heaves, Breathe him, Stimulate her. Your eyes to view erogenous souls, Your hand to snatch purity, Your tongue for aphrodisiac treats, An evening of alluring harmony.

      by Lady Assassin @ Light Animations    I traced the cicatrix that was formed from the strife. Though I am remorseful, I cannot heal you. Take this as your manna, a bliss in this violent carnage. Let me be your strength, as from there, I could go on...     "The Parting" chapter (summarized)   The last battle was with Ryuji, her ally...  The majestic sun was setting behind the Casimir mountains.  Side by side, they went to the lake where Ryuji pledged love everlasting. Wind caressed her long hair that touched his shoulders.  Ryuji seized the moment to look at Casimir's princess. Strong, silent, beautiful; he described Maya.  Ryuji took Maya to the lake, beside it was an arched tree where native flowers coiled the branches. This place was shrouded with Lavander-like incense, the reason why this was Maya's favorite nook.    "I don't know if you still recall, but I proposed to you at this very spot." Maya gave a tight smile, but obvious sadness conquered her eyes. Ryuji took out the ring that was made out of Casimir's fine grass.  "Before I proposed, we were talking about our future, how we would live together... While talking, I was braiding these grasses to a ring. I..."  Maya, halting this conversation, interrupted him,  "Ryuji..."  "I suddenly took your hand, and put this ring on your finger..."  "Ryuji..."  "Then I asked you to marry me, and you said yes..."  "I don't want to hear this..."  "I said I love you..."  She briskly turned around and walked away. Hurting still that she could not think of anything from her past, she did not want to hear this memoir.  Ryuji shouted behind her, "Then you said you love me, too," tears falling down from his eyes. That was the only moment Maya saw this warrior cry. "You said you love me too, Maya..."  Stillness. Ryuji's words echoed throughout the woods that surround the lake. He desperately wanted Maya to remember their promises but it never worked.   "I'm sorry... " Ryuji wiped the tears from his eyes, inserting the ring back to this pocket.  "I understand." a firm statement went out of Maya's mouth after her long silence. It's her turn. "I went to hell and back, Ryuji, just to remember a single event from the past. I was living a quiet life until you came.  From what I gathered, we were lovers, yes... but that was time immemorial, when I was free from Luthon's spell. Now, I feel nothing towards you."  Her expression was piercing and emotionless. Every word was defined with stoicism, making Ryuji realize that everything was over between them and nothing could make her remember their past. She continued staring at him with desolation, "I will not stay here in Casimir. I will go back to the City, back to the old me. Sensei assured that Casimir will stay safe as long as the Elemental towers are guarded. I went here with you just to say goodbye and not reminisce our foolishness."  With those words, she left Ryuji, dumbstruck, aghast.   T H E  P A R T I N G    Maya's letter to Ryuji:   Ryuji,   Yesterday, I've said a lot of things that I know would make you hate me. I cannot blame you, for the woman who was with you has been deprived of her memory, the thing that was supposed to make her alive. I enveloped myself with a facade that I am resilient though I am not. I do not require anybody's love and concern because I was imposed to protect a nation. Last night, Sensei retold our story. He recounted how I was with you.  I cannot promise you anything. I do not know if I will be able to recover that wonderful past. But this is certain: someday, I will retreat, I will ease my guard, drop my sword and come home. In that very same place, I will wait for you. Until then, let fate be our guide.   Maya

      Infallible as you are to Einstein I cannot help but regard you With such wariness.   Understandably so... You, which I cannot see, smell, and touch Only feel.  The sun seizing Moments of life Dancing rapidly.  The shapeless moon  Tiptoes in the dark Leaving shadows.  Raindrops wooing Leaves golden yet shy Snow on a postcard.  Fallen friendships  Ceased breathing  Withered youth.  Love forgotten Unrequited Gone.  Love resurrected Untamed Still.  Past…  Present…  Future… You, without hands Bare of emotions.  Are you an ally? An adversary? Or just here to stay?

      One day a young man was standing in the middle  of the town proclaiming that he had the most  beautiful heart in the whole valley.    A large crowd gathered and they all admired his  heart for it was perfect. There was not a mark  or a flaw in it. Yes, they all agreed it truly  was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen.    The young man was very proud and boasted more  loudly about his beautiful heart.    Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of  the crowd and said "Why your heart is not nearly  as beautiful as mine."    The crowd and the young man looked at the old  man's heart. It was beating strongly, but  full of scars, it had places where pieces had  been removed and other pieces put in, but they  didn't fit quite right and there were several  jagged edges. In fact, in some places there were  deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.    The people stared - how can he say his heart is  more beautiful, they thought? The young man  looked at the old man's heart and saw its  state and laughed. "You must be joking," he  said. "Compare your heart with mine, mine is  perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears."    "Yes," said the old man, "Yours is perfect  looking but I would never trade with you. You  see, every scar represents a person to whom I  have given my love - I tear out a piece of my  heart and give it to them, and often they give  me a piece of their heart which fits into  the empty place in my heart, but because the  pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges,  which I cherish, because they remind me of the  love we shared. Sometimes I have given pieces of  my heart away, and the other person hasn't  returned a piece of his heart to me. These  are the empty gouges -- giving love is taking a  chance.    Although these gouges are painful, they stay  open, reminding me of the love I have for these  people too, and I hope someday they may  return and fill the space I have waiting. So now  do you see what true beauty is?"    The young man stood silently with tears running  down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,  reached into his perfect young and beautiful  heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to  the old man with trembling hands. The old man  took his offering, placed it in his heart and  then took a piece from his old scarred heart and  placed it in the wound in the young man's heart.  It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some  jagged edges. The young man looked at his heart,  not perfect anymore but more beautiful than  ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed  into his. They embraced and walked away side by  side.    How sad it must be to go through life with a  whole untouched heart.

      Eternal goodness, with hearts of light Bringer of truth and justice with might  Slays the demons that wrought havoc and despair To those faithless, hopeless, without care   Unending battle for the undying light Forever vigilant to what is right One day the Spirit will prevail Death to the torments that it entails   The spirit of light resides in us all It is within, the battle in our core Ourselves is the final ground to stand For we are the temple blessed by God's hand   Living temple of God, Masters of creation We are key to the triumph of the Fallen's liberation It's not written but it can be done The fallen as the victor and the salvation of none   Never weary, forever awake Demons of sin exists to desecrate Spirit of light, Sentinels of the temple Defend us, we are weak, be our example   Without the Spirit we are gone Our temporal will amounts to none Just a sweet whisper from the fallen Will sever our line to heaven   Minions of the dark, unseen evil of the world Torments the desecrated with horrors untold Constantly is the time and the struggle for all Ours is the burden, are we destined to fall?

      Did I say platonic? I cannot recall What matters most is the present, not was said before  I was seized by your wit and entangled in your charm Calmed by your words taintless of harm  Your prized presence, attention and thought Like the others from you, I have fervently sought  I thought it was fleeting, your addictive hold on me Waiting for it to pass thinking I’ll be free  I realized that time was not truly potent I have to break my way out from your enchantment  My reason as my sword and my will as my shield I have broken your spell, my quest fulfilled  The final blow that brought my struggles to an end Was the fear of losing you as a dear friend  Did I say platonic? Now I recall What matters most is the present and what will be from now on

      Malamig na hangin kumot sa katawan nitong mandirigma, sahig ang kanlungan.  Nakapikit ang mga mata mga labing nagpipigil ng marahang pagsambit ng libong panalangin.  Pilitin mang matulog diwa ay kusang gigising lilisanin ang panaginip may himig ng uyayi.  Malakas na pag-ungol bakas sa mukha pakikibakang pasakit kalaban ay sino?  Pait ng nakaraan asin sa sugat malaya at sariwa tuluyang naghihingalo.  Impit na pag-iyak hikbing kumakawala gustuhin mang lumimot hapdi ang ala-ala.  Bangungot ang pag-asa iyon ang pamuksa sa katawang pagal sa kaluluwang patay.  Ngunit angkin niya dugong marangal hindi pasusupil anuman ang wakas.  Maliit man ang apoy sa kalungkutan ng gabi ito’y magniningas kasabay ng tala.  Yakap ang tapang siya’y mahihimbing gigising sa umaga sisilay sa araw.    Siya’y mandirigma Dugo ang sandata.

      I was not thinking of Eden or an island ever virgin, neither of a palace in the heavens.  I was not looking at the sun’s rays blinded by brilliance or the glowing boldness.  I was not hearing chimes of yin and yang or classical music.  I was not smelling cocoa on a rainy afternoon seducing the wind.  I was not tasting marshmallows vanilla and vainly sitting on my ice cream.  I was not touching the face of Venus’ perfection; nonchalant to Cupid’s tickle.  When I said I loved you… I was not shouting at the top of my lungs I was not even listening to my voice.    It was only a whisper of a heartbeat that probably got drowned in the ocean of bliss.

      Sometimes, I’d like to die And kiss the day goodbye Sometimes, I’d like to lie down And lay still on the ground.  Sometimes, I’d like to weep Until I fall asleep Sometimes, I’d like to think Until my body sinks.  Sometimes, I’d like to pray That I be happy and gay Sometimes, I’d like to wish That I swim like a fish.  Sometimes, I’d like to live All the things that I believe Sometimes, I’d like to breathe All the things that go shit.  Sometimes, I’d like to start And fade away in the dark Sometimes, I’d like to end And follow how they bend.  Sometimes, I’d like to whisper “Farewell” Sometimes, I’d like to shout “I’m gone.”

      “So this is  Barrio Mapagkumbaba .  Hmmm, I wonder where the party is”, Sophia Spaghetti’ s noodle strands stretched as she tried to peek in at the place.  Bright green, red, blue and yellow triangle-shaped objects danced over the big crowds.  There were people everywhere.  Children came running one after another.  Different sounds filled the air – bells ringing, men laughing and women chatting endlessly.  But the loudest of them all were the trumpets and drums of silver-uniformed men marching.  Leading the parade were ladies in golden dresses gracefully twirling batons and wowing everybody watching.  Sophia Spaghetti knew then that she was to be a big hit in this merry happening.  So she twirled in her thick tomato sauce, showing off her cheesy bits.  “My, I always look best in this velvety red gown.  Everyone will say  bellissima  when they see me – because I am truly beautiful… mmmwah”.  Next thing Sophia Spaghetti knew, she was placed on a very long table covered with a huge banana leaf.  She quickly swirled her slightly misplaced meatballs and looked at her companions. What she saw surprised her.  “Who… what are you!”  Sophia Spaghetti screeched.  The others stared at Sophia Spaghetti for a moment.   Sapin-Sapin  who glowed with her violet, yellow and red colors squealed with delight, “Welcome to our fiesta!”  It was the thin noodles with lots of vegetables, which spoke next.  “Hi, ” she curled up shyly, “I’m  Pasing Pancit Bihon  and I am very pleased to meet you, miss --? ”    “Who is she to ask my name as if she does not recognize me!”  Sophia Spaghetti could only mumble.  Aloud she said, “I am So-phee-ya Spaghetti from the great Pasta family!  So, is this the party?  In this small and dusty place?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  shamefully hid under her cabbage bits and meat chunks.  Her brother  Cardo Pancit Canton , who was short, stout, and yellowish, answered instead, “This is a fiesta!  We give thanks to our patron saint who is very good to us.  And during fiestas, we have banderitas, those colorful triangles that you see hanging around.”   Cardo Pancit Canton  was proud of his town.  Sophia Spaghetti was annoyed because she does not know anything about a fiesta.  “We have none of these foolish things in the big city.  What we have are plenty of colorful and blinking lights – everywhere, every night.”   “Wow, you came from the big city!” cried the white round-shaped  Putos  as they bumped into one another.  “We’ve always wanted to go there,” they went on excitedly.  As she curved to look at them, her noodles gave out a loud swishing.  “Huh, what on earth are you!  You are totally black, like mud!”   Beside the  Putos  was the deep bowl of  Dinuguan , which turned even darker.   Dino Dinuguan  grew sad over the rude remark about his color so he kept silent.      Then Sophia Spaghetti smelled something bad.  “What’s that dreadful odor?  Oh, I can’t bear to be on this table anymore!”  The pot of orange  Kare-Kare  bubbled up in anger, “That is my good friend  Bong Bagoong .  Never judge him by his smell because once you taste him, you will surely like him.  We make a good team.”      “ Mare Kare-Kare , control yourself.  Miss Sophia Spaghetti here is our guest.  We should make her feel at home.”   Bong Bagoong  was not at all offended by how Sophia Spaghetti treated him.  “Let us all introduce ourselves so that she will know us better.”  But before anyone could start, Sophia Spaghetti sneered.  “I bet  Bong Bagoong  and  Dino Dinuguan  will be the champion leftovers here because they are the ugliest!  Shee-hee-hee!”  The others remained quiet but Sophia Spaghetti did not seem to notice.  She continued talking and scoffing at the same time.  “Why do you have such funny names?  But then again, they suit you well because you are all so funny looking.  I bet the visitors won’ t eat you at all. Their stomachs will ache from laughing hard simply by looking at you.” Sophia Spaghetti shook with laughter until her meatballs and cheese scattered.  The roasted pig lying on the middle, the King of every fiesta table, has been observing Sophia Spaghetti.  In all his shining glory, he declared, “A-hoink…A-hoink.  I am the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon .  As everybody know, ” and he looked at the others meaningfully, “it is my duty to restore the peace and order on this table.  Sophia Spaghetti…”  Sophia Spaghetti hastily interrupted and spoke in her most dramatic voice.  “I, the fairest of all noodles – the whitest and firmest of them all – is expected to listen to an old dark-skinned hog like you!  My, why don’t you just nibble on that apple in your mouth.”    The rest got angry.  To disrespect the wise and honorable Judge  Listo  was the last straw.  They all prepared to attack Sophia Spaghetti with their vegetable and meat weapons.  A food fight was about to take place when, like the true leader that he was, Judge  Listo Lechon  shook his head slowly and said, “Now, now, please calm yourselves.  Do not ever forget that we are here for the same reason.  Our duty is to feed the hungry and make everyone happy.”  Sophia Spaghetti, who grew scared at the sight of  Pasing Pancit Bihon  ready to hurl carrot sticks at her, now sighed with relief.  She jeered at the others once again, “Don’t be so jealous.  I’m sure that after they finish eating me, they will turn to you.”  “Sometimes, it’s just so hard to be the best,” she whispered to herself.  Finally, somebody shouted  -- “It’s eating time.”  Sophia Spaghetti felt the heat of excitement.  “Now, these dishes will certainly die of envy,” she snickered.  All the people flocked to the long table.  Each one wanted to taste the dishes served.  All the dishes, on the other hand, desired to be tasted.  Elders and children gathered near  Pasing Pancit Bihon .  Everyone liked her crisp vegetables and delicious chorizos.  Pasing Pancit Biho n was glad that she pleased the guests.    Everyone praised  Cardo Pancit Canton  because he was tasteful with all the large chunks of vegetables, pork, and chicken.   Cardo Pancit Canton  exchanged smiles with his sister.    The combination of  Dinuguan  and  Puto  was naturally a fiesta favorite.  So was the popular pair of  Kare-Kare  and  Bagoong .   And, of course,  Sapin-sapin  was the number one dessert.  Each dish had fun except Sophia Spaghetti.  Nobody had tasted her sweet red sauce or noticed her cheesy dress.  She felt like crying.  She never felt so embarrassed in her entire spaghetti life.  She asked herself, “Why don’t they want to eat me?”   Pasing Pancit Bihon  glanced at Sophia Spaghetti and saw that she was sinking in her thick sauce.  She coiled into a smile to cheer her up, “Don’t worry.  They’re going to like you, too.  It’s not everyday that people here see something like you.”  Sophia Spaghetti then felt sad as she realized how vain and proud she was.  She remembered how she mocked  Dino Dinuguan  and  Bong Bagoong .  She was deeply ashamed at the way she looked down on the other dishes as if she was the only one beautiful.  She spoke softly, “I am very sorry.  Please forgive me for being mean.  The honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  was right.  We were made beautiful to give happiness to everybody.”  All the dishes gave Sophia Spaghetti a warm smile.   Bong Bagoong  then  remarked, “Hey, arrange your meatballs and grated cheese now.  Your guests are here.”    Quick little footsteps rushed to the table.  Sophia Spaghetti recognized that one of them was the cute girl who grated cheese for her.  The girl asked her two playmates, “Hey, why don’t you both have spaghetti?  It tastes good.”  One of the playmates answered, “We’re not used to that kind of food.  Is it like pancit?”  The other made a face, “Yuck, is that blood all over?”  The girl urged her playmates, “C’mon, just try it.”  The playmates grabbed forks and scooped up Sophia Spaghetti.  They fell silent for awhile and then exclaimed, “You’re right, it’s delicious – it’s sour-sweet!”   The three children called on their other playmates and relatives to taste the spaghetti.  Everybody loved her.  Sophia Spaghetti was so happy.  She did not even notice that only a few noodle strands were left.  She twisted in a wide grin at the honorable Judge  Listo Lechon  and he could only wink in approval.
