      I've been busy lately, I've been attending modeling workshops and fixing something sa school. Fortunately, I still got the time to list everything that I'll do everyday. In that way, I can manage little things I'm dealing with. A lot more important, I still manage to be "ME". I do manage to put occassional posts on this bulletin blog as you may have noticed. And also, I can still be with my "love" during leisure time.  I haven't realized that there are lots of self-rejuvenation and vanity demands that I need to put attention to. Yeah-you chorus. As you guys know that I'm Mr. Conscious and Mr. Vain. I need to go into this and to that (have my hair cut, adjust my braces, et cetera). It's not easy to be me. Beauty, brains and brawn management. Was it my fault if I'm blessed with these gifts? I need to take care of it. I'm just joking. Half meant. Gah! Woohoo, partial insanity na ko mga dudes. I wish I could auto-pilot instruct my brain to do these tasks without further confirmation. I'm tired.  Last night, I went to Shangri-La Plaza to meet my "love", basta yun..I got tired and all that. It's a matter of exhaustion pero with love blending out. Sweet.  Have you noticed that there's no coherence on everything I write. (And then you'll say, Andrew does that always). To all my readers, thank you for making tiyaga on reading my articles. It's not easy to write, you know. You have to condition your mind, relax your spirit, concentrate and write. Plus, add the fact that I'm reading Split Second by David Baldacci, whew! I do that normally when I get bored, I go out to buy the latest bestselling books out of the market. Boredom was a reason and to get along with it is another thing. Hah! I'm tired. I still have to sleep for at least 16 hours to make bawi.  Later. Get some rest din guys. Zzz.

      Hey guys, it's been a long time since I posted here. I've been busy dealing with some businesses plus the typhoon that suddenly came by. Huff Puff! And as everybody may or had experienced, this typhoon was nakakabadtrip. Add a cocktail of news to everybody that Jasmine Trias got eliminated in American Idol, anybody's day would really be dealing with fingercounting boredom. As a matter of fact, I would like to inform you guys that these past days were so dull and pale. Can somebody please hit the brakes? Stop this doomtrain once and for all. We all need a break.  I am currently enrolled as a modeling workshop student right now. Practices were tough and schedules seem to be so hectic. I still find time to chat. Actually, I prioritize chatting. No, actually I am addicted to it. Waah! I need to survive. Were these things had been an effect of a long-time summer. Or was it me and the summer wasn't that long? You know guys, I don't know what I'm typing right now. It's just an impromptu and spontaneous thoughts that rushed into my mind and directly typing it here. Critics may have noticed that there was no coherence in every paragraph I made. I know and I am certain of my objective. That is, to inform everyone that I am really bored. Tapos my bestfriend left pa. I don't have any contacts with him this day. He just left a message that he's going out. Sorry for shifts and hops and I'm sure this article was all baloney. I'm surviving a primo mix of boredom................ Later. Shit.

      **How come Aga Muhlach looked happy when he gave things away?  We never knew when things will be drifting away from us. Nor in the way, we knew when things will leave us behind. Sometimes, spontaneously they just pop out away from us. Randomly. Uncool. So am I. I feel the familiar weird feeling when things slip off my grip.  I wanted to have someone that I couldn't get. Maybe because we aren't meant for each other. I don't know. And that, even if how hard I reach for that person, it keeps on parrying away or I keep on pushing him/her out. Is it a nature of a thing, or a punishment in that case?  Last night after the slumber party (or rather morning because it's already around 4am), I sort of fell on silence and I found myself slumped on a comfortable bed reflecting on different transpirations and happenings of the days that gone by and passed by. Before going to sleep, I thought why things that you I getting and thriving were the ones who keep sliding and drifting. It seems like some things aren't for me. And for me, the hardest part is...accepting the fact that they are unattainable. Acceptance is my major opponent in this life struggle. Or should I call it like that? When I woke up this morning, my phone beeped. I was staggering on my way to the side table of my room to get my mobile phone. Hmm, I shrugged on the first message, nah just a quote. I wiped my eyes and planned to get back to sleep as another beep awoken my senses again. A special friend missed me and made me feel special. Need not to mention who he/she is. I know he/she's special. In my heart. And you know guys and dudes, when things drift away from you, surely some things will be of replacement and might be better than the one you lost. Till then. Later guys.

      10:00 AM. As I walk through Rustan's doing some window shopping and checking out the latest stuffs, I felt chestered so I called some of my friends. I phoned JD and told him to gather EB-mates in the next couple of hours. Boredom would really kill me during that time. I even called Krys via mobile phone for her to meet me at Rustan's and I told her to bring some of her friends. I was just about to plot a big EB. There it goes, moments of endless steps through the mall, checking "can't afford stuffs" because all I got was nonetheless not suitable for a lucrative shopping. So I felt tired and waited them at the foodcourt. As I was about to sit, Rico texted me that they're going to come. about 5:00 PM they already came and I met them at TokyoTokyo ground floor Rustan's. Since JD and company hadn't, I texted them a couple of times and blah blah..and a while they're here na. We're 7: Rico and Leemar, JD, Tony, Leo, Sysco and I. Simultaneously, I have to fetch Krys at Mega. So we busted through Mega and met Krys looking wasted waiting for us. I never thought that they're already there since noontime. Apology. I hadn't met her friends. She told me that they've gone home already. I thought of plotting a gimik after malling. I told my cousin Krys to join Aunt Me-An and my mom so that she'll have no problem with the ride on the way home. Krys gone home, I told my company to come visit greenbelt and make tambay there for maybe some coffee, yosi and stuffs. Unfortunately, due to some financial constraints, I didn't know that they hadn't brought M with them. We found ourselves out wanting to go somewhere place. I brought them to Eastwood City, Libis. 2:00 AM. No strength, bored, no money. Finally, we decided to go home. Down Bed. Zzz.

      I'm not thankful nga pala. I have to go to my ortho...do rehearsals and fix a lot of things. I thought it would be different. I just kind of slumped myself in a corner, recovered from staggering all these time...and what's more? I'm still alive. Gah! Ortho at afternoon, go to the mall to buy some personal stuffs, order PE uniform, go home. And yes, I need to sit on a comfy seat and get some facials...I need to go to my dermatologist every 2-3 weeks, pang 3rd week na ngayon. ARRRGHH...I hate Manila!!?!?!! ortho, derma, etc this weekend. Good luck on myself. Later. =(

      I got hooked up on reading books these past few days. I can't imagine my face slumped on thin papers. I am reading Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code and finishing the last parts of Zafra's Twisted VI. Well, it depends upon my mood. Today's a freaky friday talaga. Hehe! Shit happens all the time. Ouch for you.   I feel so tired kanina upon checking out the results, I had been so exhausted and I look so wasted. As in wasted, imagine yourself standing and falling in line for about half an hour. Upon seeing the cashier feels so asar kasi she's matanda with an odd face tapos with an attitude that'll surely put everyone in disgust. I hadn't applied sunblock pa, and a cocktail mix of manila smoke belches and cigarette puffs would really cause your brain to somersault a couple of times. Sakit sa ulo, and I had this alay-lakad hella bitch parang all of a sudden I feel so weak on my knees. I went to Dapitan for refreshments, I saw my angel and everything's gone. Seems like magic no? Heaven-made. Pareho kaming good looking. SooOooOoo what? I'm proud.  And you, this is my thing. I don't need you to comment on my works. Grab an adjective and throw it on my works, I don't care. Besides, what's with you getting hooked up with my works and all. FYI, this is not broadcasted anymore. Naawa po ako sa inyo. Kung ikaw binabasa mo to, siguro crush mo ko. Ano kaya? Hehehe! Don't insist yourself on something which isn't for you. My works were not done for you.  It's the way I express myself. My "shammy" diary. Not made for you to click and read. Besides, you made me laugh. Thanks for that.

      I am back. I hadn't posted recently, there are hella things bothering me and literally does bother me. Keeps me busy. Aww..I'm school-less right now, but I'll enroll sooner or later on FEU or UA&P, I dunno where my dad will throw me. But I hope, and I'll do good this time talaga. Heheh! Silly, bitchy bitchy naughty self. Fuck Andrew.   I definitely have the rattish brain right now. I don't care. Everything goes right naman. Everything flows smoothly, I am just being preoccupied over a lot of things lately. I had been repeatedly contacted by Rose G, our motha manager in RUP, if I wanted to be included in the fashion show this July 3, 2004. I will also enroll at a french class this time. I have a lot of things to do. I also have to go to the gym daw. I promised my friend to be with him and work out for the rest of the semester. Promises as contracts. Whew! Profusely sweating over things, yet I'm still alive. Thank God.  Rat-coated life...Hehe! There are so many rats to be thrown out. Dami. I have been currently busy dealing with a lot of stuffs and I need to drop some of those works. Me thinks I am a no-superhero. Hirap din. I still have to deal with my VTR Recommendation given by Tita Rose to Ideal People and sana, I'll get accepted. Wish me luck. I need a bunch of those.  I'll keep this blog posted. I just have to do something right now. Sorry guys, have a wonderful weekend. Color your dull life. Later. =)

      **Apologies. I can't mention names.  I consider someone who's special to me. I just met that someone 3 days ago. I can't believe I'm being stunned over with that someone that fast. People around me know who I am. I had been used and exposed to massive irregularities and living through complexities. I can't say that I'm in love as well as I can't say that I'm not in love with that somebody, but I definitely can't conclude that I'm infatuated. I know myself more that anybody else. Now I'm experiencing confusions on my personal self that I myself can't work to know these. I think that's being head over heels on someone. I don't know if it's right or wrong. Close friends know that I'm a fighter over everything. I cannot always win somebody or someone out there. I respect and accept defeats. Now I'm taking risk of being in love. But I won't be able to win that somebody by the fact that "that somebody" has a special someone in that somebody's life. That somebody made my knees weak everytime I saw that somebody. Perhaps, I consider that somebody an angel in my life. I treasure our friendship so much. I can hardly fall in love over somebody. But now, I am experiencing phobia on cliffs. No, I mean I feel anxious over that. I cannot afford to fall again and get hurt. I'm willing to wait. Even water runs dry, even eternity definition's exceed over it's limitations, even risking love's capacity or over risking it. Life's taking risks. It's a law.  I think I am falling in love over that somebody, but I think this time was so odd. I told myself before that I can't be a slave over immature relationships forever. A quote stating "sino ang pipiliin mo, ang mahal mo o ang mahal ka?". Now I'm firm with my choice and I'm braced over its consequences. Heart cannot be taught. Feelings cannot be deceived. I'm not into any purpose of writing this to boast anything and impress anyone but only to state to everyone what I feel. I think I'm head over heels on somebody.  As I've said, I'm willing to wait more that eternity can bring. I can wait forever. As my trademark lives, I give 101% to anyone I love. I think I'm giving 95% already. Though, we're not for each other and we got the wrong time. I missed that somebody so much. "Every single day, every night I pray, I'll be missing you..". Did I get the right lyrics posted. Anyway, I'm just imparting mere feelings on me.  To my angel, I'm head over heels on you. I don't care what people say. I respect you. I respect your feelings, your decisions, your choice. I'm willing to wait for you. Waiting without any hesitations, any reservations, anytime. Tell me when to love you, and I'll be there in a split second. I cannot teach my heart. But being head over heels do so. It's not teaching anyway. It's doing direct expressions over you. I'm not getting "madrama" this time nor do some "pa-sweet" effect. I just want you to know what I feel.  I'll be your dear baby, your dear friend at the mean time. Till then. Later. See you in this world.

      I copied this from my friend's blog. If you have time, you can answer this and post it sa comments. =) It's sort of "before classes go in" request stuff...  Ayt..here it goes..  1. Who are you? 2. Are we friends? 3. When and how did we meet? 4. Do you have a crush on me? 5. Would you kiss me? 6. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 7. Describe me in one word. 8. What was your first impression? 9. Do you still think that way about me now? 10. What reminds you of me? 11. If you could give me anything, what would it be? 12. How well do you know me? 13. When was the last time you saw me? 14. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 15. Are you going to put this on your weblog and see what I say about you?

      Decisions bring about a change to everyone's life. I myself had gone critical decision-making so many times in my life. Kaya yun, now I have to deal with another decision again. This time, it's on setting priorities and building confidence once again.  If you read my articles, you may have known how much I'm hurt caused by a break-up and lot of disgusting stuffs and transpirations that I, myself, would never ever want to experience it again. Getting hurt serves a lesson. But the feeling it entails with seems unbearable. Overcoming them is a tough one. That's where conditioning of mind, setting goals again and tough decisions are made.  Once again, I would like to tell everyone that every decision is a choice as well as every choice has a corresponding consequence. It's a law. Nobody can change it. And it's nature was to be like that. So we shouldn't give a damn about it and we shouldn't be making "dibdib" to it. Get a life.  Keep yourself busy and let your mind get pre-occupied with a lot of things. It gradually mends and heals our broken hearts and finally it conditions our mind to start a new life over again. So next time, you've learned your lesson na... sana put everything you've learned into application. Otherwise, you'll get hurt and you'll be a slave of your stupid mind and odd decisions.  Gah...gotta be prepared...later. =)

      continuation...  First of all I want to apologize to you guys if my update was late already, I've been fixing a lot of stuffs talaga. So yun.  Anyway, on dealing with "someone special" making it "special someone" seems harder but safer. Harder in a way, we take the risk of being rejected or being accepted to advance it to another level. But if so, as what I've said, it's safer because we don't need to know the person deeper for there is the fact that you've known that person for a long time already. Kaya nga he/she was considered to be someone special. Looking at reality, majority of serious intact relationships started at friendship talaga. That's what I'm pointing out. We could definitely love someone that we consider special in an intimate way. It's not hard doing so.  Why not try to look around? Maybe it's you who has been in this situation. Being inlove with somebody you consider special...  You know guys, every decision comes up with taking risks and accepting the consequences. Whatever decision we do, there's always a consequence. And whatever consequence it may be, there's always a reason. And whatever reason it may be, we need to accept it for every reason, good or bad, colors life. Live life as always. Don't make your life a come-what-may cycle. Put a direction man. Eventhough it's a series of ups and downs, it's life's nature to be like that. Remember, don't expect life to give you the best, but in the other way, life expects you to give the best to it and to live it to the fullest.  Till then...later.. =)

      Two people, being in a relationship (doesn't necessarily be up one level to friendship) for so long may have experienced some magic in them. I definitely would like to discuss this to everyone. Let me differentiate this two separate terms: Someone special is a term used for people which you find special, and those whom you find comfortable to be with, sharing ideas and opinions, hang-out mates, gimik barkadas, maybe your relatives, parents. The other term "special someone" merely speaks of a person whom you find special in a superlative degree. Despite the despites and above the aboves. Someone you find so rare, you can't afford to lose, whom you love wholeheartedly, without any reservations, pretensions and doubts. Astig diba?  Now I'm going to ask you...when can there be an evolution of someone special to special someone? Parang you'll gonna raise it up one level pa. Oooopss...I'll just continue this tomorrow. I ran out of time. (Exciting tong topic na to, don't miss)

      I just broke up with my partner...huhu! Sad...anyway, nakarecover na ko. I guess life's just like that, some things aren't meant for you. All you have to do when you fell down, you just have to brace yourself, get up on your knees and walk again. Well, you have to continue again and walk on your life's path, you have to be careful this time. All I'm implying is that, when you committed something wrong, syempre you have to do something for it not to repeat again.  Swerving paths, swerving worlds...All of us have to live another world, rotate in a different axis and spin around in a different pathway. Things are subject to that. All things come unpredictable, at times inevitable, and some matters in these things hurt us in one way or another. We have to be ready on everything. You can't live a world wherein everything doesn't go on a balance. In a relationship, some things have to be mutual. On the other hand, it won't work if not so. Surviving. Precisely, surviving and learning to view other life perspectives will help everyone. It helped me a lot. It helped me realize stuffs that I would not want to realize. Things that I prefer to be blinded than to see those. Facing reality is hard. And we have to accept that facing non-real matters is way too harder.  I don't have any intention on teaching you these things. Perhaps, you're still the only one who could teach yourself. I'm just sharing this thing to you.  ...sometimes the things which are the most important is the one that you can't see...  I advise you to open your eyes and heart. Broaden up the "understanding" factor in you. Don't just give up on a thing. Some things can hurt us very bad. Worse. Worst. Be smart dude. Use your head. Live life. If you get hurt, rise up and start all over again. Close and end a chapter, then open a new one. I've done this. Trust me. Life's composed of various divisions...of love, of faith and of living. Each one's composed of chapters, start one and end one. Don't omit a chapter if it hurts you, rather keep it up and learn from it. Believe me, I guarantee you, every chapter makes us strong. Everything has a reason. Just think that life's intention of being imperfect makes life perfect. Nobody can live perfectly, lahat nadadapa...lahat umiiyak...lahat nasasaktan. Don't lose hope. Hope is free and infinite. It doesn't wear out and it won't leave you. Hold on. Hold on to the hands of hope...and you'll see better things that await you. Be strong.  I still am in the process of learning things. It's a part of growing up. It's a part of our life. My life. Your life. Our life.
