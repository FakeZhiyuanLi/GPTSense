         man o' man, why did i wake up when i could have saved myself from a day of torment by simply sleeping myself closer to that time when i look over at my alarm clock and smashing the snooze till i finally realize "oh, shit, i have to be at work in 20 minutes!" with a change of clothes and a 15 minute bike ride as all that i can afford time-wise to prevent being late or even fired.  brushing of teeth? pfft... that's out of the question.  breakfast?  not on my best day!  morning wizz?  that can wait till i get there.  that, folks is what i have to look forward to.       the problem is that is something i really and truly look forward to!  i resent the fact i have been both blessed and cursed with a mind that would spank the ears off of the energizer bunny itself... by that i mean during work i am able to crank out solutions to problems with scant effort, but if there is not pressing issues to be solved or troubles to shoot then i have a self destuctive tendancy to wallow in a pit of things i can't fix or simply wish i could escape from.       last night i got shot down by a huge patriot missle with the best rack in the whole room for my roommate.  now i know what ya'll are thinking..... "get over it, dude!", but i spent about an hour and a half thinking that she was diggin me (hell, she even made a point of saying so) until a potty break left her enough time to reel my buddy over who hadn't said two words to her and start attempting to extract his tonsils by way of a kiss. even better was that as i was talking to her earlier, the waitress i had chatted with a while back decides to inform my room mate that she had been interested in me until she saw me with the patriot missle.  great night... after that i proceeded to help a standed dude with his flat tire in the parking lot while my roommate got the numbers of both the waitress and the patriot missle.     but hey, i'm getting a new apartment with my current roommate which is good as he found out that i couldn't get one for myself even if i did have all the money in the world... bad credit! no, no.... 124 points out of a possible 1000 as a credit score. fun, fun, fun!     as miniscule as these things are, they aren't even a taste of the things that fester in my brain on those coveted days off!!!  i'd like to have a hobby but i can't seem to find a shut off valve that works effectively to release or express those nuggets of torture upstairs.  maybe i should get really stoned???  oh yeah... drug testing at work!!!! yeahh, baby!     why did i get up this morning?
