I am not sure what we are doing yet but on Saturday it is supposed to be crappy... I just hope at least one of the days they are here it is nice... Robbie is alot better now...he still has a cough but it is not as bad as it was the other day... Gotta get the van fixed because when I slow down the van shakes... I get to do that tomorrow... Fun FUN!!!! So well not much else going on... My buddy Kevin has a brand new neice and a brand new nephew. The neice is his brothers daughter and the nephew is his sisters son... almost 2 years ago his sister and sister-in-law had boys a month apart from each other... Pretty cool... Soo well... not much else... oh Troy is at a baseball game tonight with his co-workers...

						   Ahhh a brand new day... This morning I woke up to the sounds of a crying 3 year old because his poor tummy was hurting... The little guy is feeling much better... THANK THE LORD!!!! I really hate it when he is sick... He is clingy, crys more and I have no time for myself... OH wait but that is why I love being his mommy... So anyways... Troy decides that he wants to make ice cream... yummy.. We went to Home Depot yesterday to pick up a few things. Troy came across an ice cream maker... So being the good wife I am I said all right pick it up... So he did... I have to admit it was pretty cool watching this thing make ice cream... And it tastes good!!!!!! Yummy Yummy in my tummy... HE HE!!!! Well that is about it... Some news from the home front... My little brother graduated from high school this past friday... Troy was saying man I remember when he was going to be a freshman... I actually kinda feel old... It dawned on me that my little sister Kathy is going to be a junior next year and that means in only 2 short years she will be graduating... That means that my 10 year reunion will be that same year... Freaky... very freaky.... Oh well... So i am getting old... Later Days

						   You want to know what the most annoying sound is.... MEXICAN music... VERY LOUD MEXICAN MUSIC!!!!! Living near a whole bunch of mexicans is not bad really it is not but when you have to hear the music playing FULL BLAST!!!! It gets annoying... Most of the neighbors are cool.. They keep to themselves don't bother anyone but the ones on the very end of the block just don't seem to give a damn about anyone.. They play there music loud every weekend... and they do it outside... Oh and something else that makes me laugh... THEY USE THEIR CAR RADIOS!!!!! When they have party they use their car radios for music... CRAZY!!!! The best one I thought was hilarious was this... A few doors down this guy put in his stereo in his car and he has a remote control for it... WHO IN THE WORLD HAS A REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE CAR RADIO???? MORONS... I tell ya...   So 2 more weeks, Dad will be here with Kathy and Megan... It is going to be fun times.. I am getting excited... I just hope we can make sure they have a great time!!! Planning on going to Rocky Mountain, Estes Park the tourist type of stuff... One day I know I want to take Kathy and Megan down to Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. That should be a good time... It is a whole new world down there... Street Performers and all that...   Well that is about it for today... Trying to get ahold of my nephew Justin he turns 15 today... I was 10 when he was born... It is crazy to think that next year he will be driving... SCARY!!!!! My little bro Danny turns 19 tomorrow.. They are having a bday/graduation party for him tomorrow also... Then on the 12th of July he leaves for boot camp (marines), CRAZY!!!!  Later Days!!!

						   I just reread my last blog. It is almost a year since my mom died.. I think about her often especailly right now with all the crap that is going on back home. If it is not one thing it is another.... First of this week I find out my neice and nephew ran away from home. They got into an arguement with there mom and dad and ran away for 2 nights. They are okey now... They are working things out with the rents. Then i find out something so horrible that it basically makes me sick to my stomach. My sister who just got divorced last year had an affair with her BEST FRIENDS HUSBAND! Becky (my sister best friend) has been like a sister to me for many years.... Now I don't know the whole story... but one day I will hear about it.... So that may be a later post...   I really do wonder why people act the way they do....    On a happier note... My older brother Mike is moving down to Kentucky this weekend...He is excited... My other brother (I have alot of brothers) is in Burlington, KY... They are not that far from each other which is cool.... I am excited for him....   well all... time for me to get my self ready to get Troy from the airport... He is coming home from Houston tonight...  Later days

						   I was watching the sunset buriel of Reagon last night and I have to admit I was touched. I cried yes I did. It all started with those bagpipes playing Amazing Grace, then to hear the 21 cannon going off, not too mention the F18 I beleive going by... and of course the folding of the flag and giving to his wife. I think what really affected me was when Nancy and her children going up to the coffin and seeing her cry. I cried pretty hard. Now I do know I wasn't crying because the ex presisdent died but to see someone who has looked so strong these past few years break down, that affects a person.   It actually brought me to think about my mom. See my mom passed away almost a year ago and I never really got to say good bye. The day before she died I talked to my dad and I asked him should I go home he said no Rose stay there until further notice. So me being who I am I stayed.The next moring I went to work and at 12:00 headed to a baseball game with the rest of the gang at work. Even though I had this feeling that I shouldn't go but something inside me said No Rose just go have a good time, enjoy yourself. So I did. Only to come home get the dreaded phone call from my little brother saying I quote no lie  "we are going to have to pull the plug".  Nice... so me being here in Colorado thinking what the fu?????????? Then only to have my sister get on and try to calm me down handing the phone to Troy where he says well at least I think he was saying something along the lines that he had to go get plane ticket call later with details when to pick up Rose at Detroit. So within 1 1/2 hours after that phone call I find myself on a plane (mind you the first time I have  ever   flown.) Crazy.   I boarded the plane at 6:30 which on the east coast was 8:30.   The time my mom passed away.    She was 59.    Just 3 1/2 hours before her 60th birthday.    I miss her.    I really do.

						   Okey... So another memorial weekend come and gone... Luckily for me I had a nice 4 day weekend... My in-laws came into town on Friday... well mom-in-law and sis-in-law, Friday night I took them to Build A Bear and they made there bears, then on Saturday we headed up to Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park... we saw it snowing (yes snow) and it was cool... Troy and I went out Saturday night just the two of us.. Went to Texas Roadhouse then went shopping at the mall.. Troy was looking for a new pair of shoes he got them and I got new sandels, then we went to best buy and bought the Lord of the Rings movies... Pretty cool if you ask me... then we went home... Sunday we just bummed around the house... We had a nice dinner of Ribs, twice baked potato and corn on the cob... it was yummy... Of course all fun things must come to an end... Mom and Kathy left on Monday morning at 4:30.... When Robbie woke up he looked around and said "where's grandma"????? He misses her... and aunt kathy also.. Well all I gots to be going... Later days....

						   I have my cat now.. His name is Bernie he is about 5 months old and a little tabby cat... I heart him... He does like to wake me up about 3:30 in the morning but it could be worse.. I just ignore him then he goes away...   Troy came home from Philly last night... Robbie and him are going to Vegas and New Orleans when he turns 21... They were watching Celebrity Poker last night and Robbie told Troy that he wanted to play cards.. So Troy and him decided that when Robbie turns 21 they are going to Vegas...   In a week it will be one year since my mom passed. Hard to beleive that a whole year has passed but it did... Wow... this time last year I was on the phone with her talking to her telling her how things were going out here... 5 days later she died.. It is so unreal almost... I still wish I could pick up the phone and call her and hear her voice....   I really miss her

						   I am getting my cat on Friday... and not too mention but we are going to be getting a house at the end of august early september... It is basically just right around the corner from our house right now... It is a 2 story house 3 bedrooms, fireplace, very very nice kitchen, office and a unfinished basement... I really really love this house... Our landlord isn't even going to show this house to anyone else!!!! It's ours... It has been since 1999 for me to be in a real house... Troy hasn't lived in a "real" house since 1992... So this is a good thing... The yard is all right... There really isn't that much to it but at least we have grass!!!! There is a small area also that has a garden... Troy and I even offered if they needed any help we would be happy to help them out to get the house fixed up... I will pull weeds... I will do anything they need me to do!!!! The rent is actually not that bad... about 200 morea month but well... that is when we just got to not spend as much.... So my cat his name is Taz... he is a tiger cat... I can't wait to bring him home!!!!! I know Troy is going to like him just as much as I do... Robbie has not a clue yet... well anywhos  Later days!!!!

						   So I was talking to Troy and kinda whining that I wanted a cat... Guess what he agreed... I was surprised.. So I took a nice drive into Boulder to check out the human society... they want $95-145 to adopt a kitten or a cat... No thank you... I went to PetSmart to see about a there adoption center.. I saw a kitten there that I just fell in love with her name was Darcy.. I have a feeling that I won't get her.. Oh well... So  I came home and started looking on line and I called one lady who rescues cats... I may have to check her out... There are a few others that I can call about also...   What makes me want to get a cat.. I don't know I just really want one... I want to look at so many cats and just test them all out then pick out the one that would be the most enjoyable to have... I used to never really like cats but they are growing on me... We shall see...  Of course I still have to check it out with my landlord... but I am hoping that she will let us.. We shall see....  Later days....

						   So where was I with the week of fun I believe we ended with Monday...    OK Tuesday.... Megan, Kathy and I went horseback riding along with my friend Cindy's daughter Autumn... We went on an hour ride through a trail... I was surprised about the trail... it was pretty hard to do... Of course I was on one of the slower horses... Hey it’s been since 1997 since I have been on a horse... But we had fun... It just felt good to be out and about with my little sister... After the horseback ride we headed back home we stopped at Taco Bell in Longmont that was a trip... Two 16 year olds, one 13 year old and me... It was great times.... I have to smile about our experience... It brings a smile to my face even now.....   In the meantime my husband is about to start the pulled pork on the grill... I love the pulled pork it is great...   So we get home and we head out to Boulder to get Kathy’s nose pierced... so there we were on College Hill in Boulder at the piercing place... She gets her nose done and I have to say it looks cool on her... I mention to my dad who is with us... "The one person back home in Toledo that will have the most problem with it is Mary (my older sister)" Dads response is "who cares it is Kathy’s body she can do what she wants" GO DAD!!!!  After that we go next door to this Old Tibet store where Kathy finds this beautiful dress and Megan finds this really awesome long skirt... Dad buys me a necklace (now I just have to find a chain that is longer) and he buys Kathy these really pretty earrings...    After that experience we head for Walgreen’s to get the pictures he dropped off for one hour photo and we go to King Soopers to pick up some other stuff for dinner and some odds and ends. After the trip to the grocery store we go and pick up Robbie from daycare... Then we head home and eat... Again my dad is impressed by Troy's cooking... He asks me do you eat this well every night... I say yes dad I do....  Tuesday night finds Kathy, Megan and I at Blockbusters.... One thing about Blockbusters is this... WAY WAY OVER PRICED..... Something about renting a movie for 5.00 for a week is dumb..... But of course we do anyways... We rent Office Space and The Shining... Comedy and Horror... So we get home that night and watch movies... pretty nice.... Sleep time for me was 11:00 sleep time for girls I don't know......  Wednesday the last day... We really didn't do much at all. I took the girls with me to get my pay check stub (direct deposit is cool) and took them to the mall... We have this pretty awesome mall called Flatirons... Nice.... we had a quick bite to eat then went and played with the dogs at Pedigree Shop... I saw this beautiful Saint Bernard and a beautiful Husky... I want them... they are just too cute!!!! I also take them to Build a Bear that was really fun... So we leave the mall and head home... The girls and I decided to head up to the Boulder Falls and we watched people go tubing down the Canyon River... Pretty cool... we head home after awhile... We eat dinner and then we decided to go to Hobby Lobby so dad can find a feather for THE PIMP hat...  My dad comes across this beautiful shadow box for Troy... He says to me don't worry about the price this is the one for Troy... (I was in shock... see my dad when I was younger would have never done that... or at least I don't believe so) So he buys him this very expensive gift looks at me and says if there is anything that strikes your fancy Rose pick it up... I am in shock and can't bring myself to do that... He says to me also if there is anything that you really like please call me and let me know.... I want to buy you something.... Of course again I am in complete shock and just kind of say.... ummm well I will let you know if there is something at some other time... So then we head home and the girls want me to teach them how to make dream catchers so I do...  Kathy's comes out beautiful. Megan a mess... so Kathy I believe took it home with her to make it for her. We then go to bed... 12:00...  Thursday morning I wake up around 6:45... Get the girls up get Robbie up Take a shower head out the door with them... Take Robbie to daycare and get Dad, Kathy and Megan to the airport to head home to Toledo.... I walk through with them to check their bags and head to security... where I say good bye... I cry... I miss them... I go to the car look around and sit there for a moment and think about the week... I had fun... LOTS OF FUN!!!  I head home... the van is quiet.... I look back at this week and think wow... I really did have a great time... I realize that I feel kind of empty... Before I know it I am home... I open the door to quiet... I sit down and look around the room... No more messes to clean up, I slowly put away the air mattress... the blankets... the pillows... A sense of calm goes through my body... and I sit again.... Remembering...  The smiles  The laughs  The tears  The memories I will have forever  Later Days

						   This past week was one of the best weeks of my life. My dad, Kathy and her best friend Megan were here this week. They came in last friday at night... Unaware of the spectacular sight they were going to see the next morning considering there flight didn't get in until 8:40 and by the time we got the luggage it was pitch black outside.   I got them home went and got them somthing to eat talked to Kathy and Megan until about 2:00 a.m. and then went to sleep. I tell you two 16 year olds are a trip and a half. I had an awesome time with them. They made me realize that even with being in my mid twentys I can still have some fun. But back to the week o fun.    I wake up at around 7:30 a. m. so does Robbie. I realize oh I haven't went to the grocery store. So the girls wake up and Robbie and I take them with us to the store.. They pick out what they want to eat for the week. Surprising but I didn't really spend all that much. Head home the girls eat some breakfast.   At around 10:30 dad finally get himself out of bed. At around 12:00 we head out to Artist Point and Nederland. My dad falls in love with Nederland. We stop there and pick up some ice cream. Dad and Troy find a t-shirt they both want... Me being the good daughter and wife buys them for the two of them. We head home and have some hamburgers and french fries. Dad finds out for the first time that his son-in-law has a knack for cooking.   So after dinner Kathy, Megan and I head out to Boulder. We end up at Pearl Street. See I love Pearl Street. I love the atmosphere down there... So even though it is late we go. They love it just like I thought they would... We head home about 11:00... Get to sleep about 1:00....   Sunday morning.... We wake up eat breakfast... head to Rocky Mountain National Park. Were we see some great sights... We saw Elk and long horned Sheep... My dad is in love.... and I mean in LOVE... we head back down towards Estes Park were Troy takes the girls on this tramway up the mountain... THEY LOVED IT!!! In the meantime dad and I stay down by the gift shop were dad finds himself a few odds and ends of things and the best thing of all A PIMP HAT... Kathy of course is very much embarrased... So we head home from there were my dad starts acting like well dad... this embarasses my little sister who is just fumed... Megan and I head to Sonic to get dinner for that night. We end up at home with Kathy pissed off at me we have our little heart to heart and things seem fine we end up until 3:00 that night.   Monday morning I wake up take Robbie to the Cindys house, Troy and dad head back up to Rocky Mountain while the girls and I stay around town... We end up going to lunch at Applebees, go pick up Robbie and wait for Dad and Troy to get home. They get home around 6:45... Guess what they saw and as my dad says He can go home happy.... HE SAW A BEAR!!!!! A black bear he got a good shot of it...   So we have dinner of Tuna and Noodles which I made and my dad loved... I end up taking the girls back down to Pearl Street where we shop and have some more fun... I end up buying Kathy these very beutiful flip flops... They were black and I beleive they had butterflys on them... She was hesistant in buying them but I ended up doing it for her... we go home after that and go to sleep its 12:00... to be continued....

						   It's been a full year now... I can't help but retrace the steps I took last year... I haven't cried at all... I have been thinking about her alot today... just no tears are coming... I miss her with a passion but I just wish she was here... I miss my mommy... I have been trying to get ahold of my dad for the past couple of hours I think he is on the phone with someone...   My little brother is getting married to a woman I just don't think he should be married to... It worries me because she is like 31 and he is only 21... she has 3 kids... My brother doesn't need it... If it was up to me I would place him with a 19-22 year old kids okey (hell he has one...) I just don't know...  I heard through the grapevie my ex-brother in law is getting remarried not even a year after his divorce was final... Crazy.... I hope my neices will be all right with it... I worry about them... especially the oldest Anna... I am sure she will be all right but I just don't know...  Well going to try the father again...   Later Days  Rose
