      Does anyone feel as if the democrats want Kerry to loose so that Hillary has a better shot in 2008? I think that is the theorist in me talking.   -A   urlLink Google News : "Senator John Edwards, whom presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry chose as his running mate, is a successful trial lawyer who was seen as a rising political star when he was first elected to the Senate six years ago.

      Its been a pretty rough 24 hours I went to bed last night and for some reason kept on feeling like somebody was going to come in my room. I got out of bed several times and checked around just to make sure my home was secure and found nothing to be out of place.  Finally I got up at about 2:30 and locked my bedroom door.  I slept much later then normal almost 11:00 before I got out of bed.   I feel really really alone right now my family feels very disconnected right now.  It does not help that nobody is around right now they have all left for the time being.  I don't really feel like speaking with any of my friends right now.  I'm not depressed just lonely and I cannot peg why.  I have not been to FBX in almost a week which is very unusual.  I wish I could write all my soul had to say but I'm afraid words would do it no justice.    -A

      Ok lets shift gears life is about to change yet again for me.  Its interesting to ride the wave of flux within flux I kind of feel like and errant atom.  Speaking of which I had an idea for a band called "Unstable Adam" once but I guess that's not really on topic.   I have decided to synergise my mental and physical fitness.   In the United States physical fitness in relation to outward appearance is more prized then inner health coupled with mental and spiritual clarity. I read an article this morning with incite into Asian cultures specifically China and Japan that states true beauty can only be obtained through synergy inside and out.   So my point of the day is we spend too much time working on the outside of our homes so that everybody else knows how beautiful and elegant we are when in realty the inside has a bunch of junk drawers that need to be cleaned out.   -A

      I had a dream last night about wilde fires fires destroying the area I live in.  More specificly A giant Oscar wilde spitting flames stopping through the Alaskan wilderness. So Life is good now except for the damn smoke from the real wild fires ravaging the interior of Alaska.  My nephew is almost seven weeks old he is soo chute and chumbley.  I decided yesterday that I was going to make a new t-shirt to go along with all of the slogan t-shirts I've made its going to say JIGGLEY NiBBLIt. Don't ask me what it means its just jiggley and nibblitty.  On a side note my alter ego Dr. Cleatus McGillcutty called in yet another phone prank to my friend the honorable "JJ" in Whorelando Flordia.  He has yet to return my call I wonder if I'm on his shit list now...  -A

      Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts   urlLink Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts : "Does the world owe you a living? Were you born with a silver spoon in your mouth? Well, as a matter of fact, it does and you were. The cosmos will always do as much as it can to protect and look after each inhabitant of this Earth Just by being here on this planet, you inherit the right to feel as if your life is a special gift to be appreciated and enjoyed. That's not, of course, a guarantee of anything. Sometimes, the wrong things happen and we can't prevent them. Sometimes too though, as now, the right things occur and nothing can stop them from lighting up our lives.

      The best thing I have seen since the start of the war...  Borrowed from BoingBoing.net  LeapPads heading to Afghanistan The Department of Health and Human Services is shipping 20,000  urlLink LeapPad Learning Systems  to women in Afghanistan. While LeapPad is marketed here as en edutainment system for children, this version was modified for adults who speak Dari and Pashto but aren't necessarily able to read. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the systems will be used to inform the women about healthcare issues like diet, immunization, pregnancy, and disease prevention in, er, unique ways:  For example, said LeapFrog Chief Executive Officer Tom Kalinske, reproduction is a culturally and religiously sensitive topic in the country. The solution: a page of text and a page of pictures with the analogy of growing carrots. Growing them too close together produces skinny and not-well- formed carrots that do not look good to eat, but if you space the carrots, they're plump and appetizing -- the lesson being it's better to space children rather than having them in rapid succession.

       Well its getting to be fall here in Alaska and there is a bit of crispness to the air now. I'm pretty excited I'm ready for Moose season and being in the outdoors with watching the leaves change color. We are going berry picking this afternoon I'm pretty excited its time to make some Blueberry jam.      So what do you do when your ex-boyfriend still wants to be friends? I guess just be his friend even though I still wish I had my arm around him. He is getting ready to leave Alaska on the 22nd of September he says this is home but I kind of wonder if he will ever come back. Some days I still wish he was more a part of my journey then he ended up being.
