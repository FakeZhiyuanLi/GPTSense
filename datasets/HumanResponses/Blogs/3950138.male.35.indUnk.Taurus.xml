      My wonderful employer has the incredibly sensible and civilized policy of giving us Fridays off in the summer. Nine weeks of 4 day weeks (actually a couple of 3 day weeks thanks to the statutory holidays), what could be better? Well ok, permanent 4 day weeks would be better but hey I'm happy with what I'm given.  Today I pottered around the house, tidied up my 'workshop', built a PC which then failed to function, waited for James to get up (which finally happened at about 2:30), got the gas canister filled up and then cooked on the bbq in torrential rain, watched Silent Witness and finally blogged. What a fun day.

      I was walking to the train station from work today, strolling down Rue Stanley, when an old homeless looking man started crossing the street. He got to the middle, bent over, and stood up again with a large potato in his hand. He looked at me and said "Look, a beautiful potato in the middle of the street just for me!". Then he raised his prize aloft and proclaimed "This is the best potato I've ever owned!" and wandered off down an alley. Well that made my day.

      So what do I do every day? Well on a work day it goes something like this: At 6:10 the alarm goes off ( urlLink CBC , yes I'm getting old). I listen to the chatter on there for 10-30 minutes before struggling out of bed and into the bathroom where I clean my teeth and jump under our fabulous rain shower. That wakes me up, then I throw on some clothes (smart-ish casual), kiss my snoozling wife goodbye and run (well ok walk) downstairs. If I'm in the mood I'll throw together a sandwich for my lunch, with some fruit and whatever other snacky stuff we have.    At about 7:05 I leave the house, walking to the end of the street where the train station is, to jump on the 7:20 train to Montreal. I have the laptop on the train so I either watch a movie ( urlLink Apocalypse Now Redux  this morning) or work on some web stuff. That keeps me occupied until the train arrives in Montreal. From there its a 20 minute walk to the office.    The rest of the day is spent working on the university financial systems, until around 4 when I leave for the train journey home. I get home at about 5:20, greeted by Jen, relax for a bit, wander around our lovely garden, hang out on the deck. At some point we have dinner before vegging out in front of the tv, or finding something more exciting to do. Like  urlLink Scrabble (tm).    A couple of chapters of a book in bed, then its time for sleep.    That's it. A day in the life of me. Weekends are different of course, but they're too random to give you an average description. I'll just keep you informed when we do something fun.

      Usually there is a man on the train in the morning who gruffly announces the next station. Today the man was incredibly happy, announcing stations with obvious glee, and announcing the final station with almost a cheer. Whatever happy pills he had been taken, it affected many of the passengers too, who were leaving the train with smiles on their faces.  Happiness really is infectious.    Anyway, my brother is here from England, I picked him up from the bus station last night and bought him home for pizza and beer. Today he set out to explore Montreal and ended up spending most of the afternoon in an English pub. No imagination that boy.

      Today was our friend Cara's 30th birthday. To celebrate this momentous event we joined her and  Tyler and some friends for a very fun few games of volleyball. I was completely inept at the whole thing, as is usually the case with any kind of sporting activity, but I still had a good time. The sand was  really  hot though. After exhausting ourselves on the volleyball court (pitch? field? beach?) we headed back to their place for BBQ'd burgers and dogs and some much needed liquid refreshment. Tyler wanted to teach me Magic, but Cara wasn't having that on her birthday.

      I spend all my waking moments weeding our vegetable patch. Why do they grow so fast? Why can't they get the message? It doesn't help that our 'patch' is the size of a small sports field, I think we'll cut it in half next year. Jen mowed the lawn while I watched and drank beer, that was the fun part of the day.    So what do I have to show for our day in the garden? Well, a sunburned upper back, an achy lower back, about 874 mosquito bites, dirt under all my fingernails. Oh and a remarkably tidy veggie patch.

      I finally got around to tinkering with the computer McGill gave me. I got everything laid out on a table in the basement, then suddenly realised. I have a workshop! This is very exciting, a place I can leave junk laying around all over the place without worrying about it, and without Jen getting upset that the place is a mess. Anyway, I got linux installed, and fired up one of my spare hard disks, but it didn't have anything fun on it, so I'll be getting the other 3 installed next (one at a time because IDE sucks).    I also did a bunch of weeding and leaf raking today, I could get used to this gardening thing. Perhaps. Maybe.    Tonight we went to see the Bourne Supremacy. We got there late so got the crappy seats right at the front. It's a good movie, but not great. I think I enjoyed it more than Jen. If you like car chases and spy stuff, go see it. If not, well, don't.

      I love summer Fridays, there is something so incredibly civilized about a four day work week.     I learned about fine grain access control and policy functions today. Cool eh? Well I thought so anyway. Sometimes it feels like I'm slipping backwards in the race to stay on the cutting edge of technologies, then something happens at the university that makes me realise we're still racing, even if we're not quite up at the front. Right now I'd say  urlLink McGill  is the McClaren team in the keeping-up-with-technology Grand Prix.    Talking of Grand Prix, it's a race weekend, the  urlLink German race . Probably another home win for Michael, but here's hoping for an interesting race.

      A big yellow tent appeared by Peel on Rene Levesque today which turned out to be filled with  urlLink Scientologists . Well when I say filled, there were about 10 of them, which is quite a lot for such a pathetic little cult. The slogan on the tent was something like 'Something can be done about it'. I'm not sure what 'it' is, but doing something about 'it' probably involves holding some tin cans and getting yelled at for 10 hours. Stay away from the big yellow tent folks, the  urlLink killer cult  just wants your money!

      Improv All-Stars was amazingly hilarious, I was having trouble breathing at one point. Everything from mad scientists growing giant nipples to a cooking show with roast puppy and pussy muffins.  urlLink Colin Mochrie  was excellent as always.  urlLink Greg Proops  came out with some great Quebec/Canada gags.  urlLink Brad Sherwood ,  urlLink Sean Masterson  and Jeff Davis were all very very good too (and Jen thought Jeff was 'incredibly hot').  urlLink Drew Carey  tried hard, but he doesn't do improv as well as the others. My line got read out at one point. Greg now knows we're stalking him.    Today I made a major leap forward on my current work project, which made me tres content. I also spent some time on the  urlLink mud , but got annoyed with the whiny players so I might take a few days off from it.    I'm watching  urlLink The Godfather  on the train  to work. It's good, but I'm not sure why it's #1 on  urlLink IMDB . Maybe I'm missing something.

       After a pancake breakfast on the deck yesterday we took Alex on the obligatory Montreal tour, first heading along lakeshore, then going through upper Westmount to the lookout. They need to hack all the trees down there so we get a better view (kidding, I love trees!). We stopped quickly at our old condo then headed into Old Montreal for a wander, a boat cruise on  urlLink   urlLink Le Bateau Mouche , and a quick look around the  urlLink One of a Kind  artisan show which cost us $5 each and wasn't very good really.    Tonight we're going to see the Improv All-Stars at  urlLink Metropolis . We're stalking  urlLink Greg Proops .   urlLink

      Alex is almost here. Like a good host I've tidied the house, prepared tomato salad, potato salad, hamburgers and fruit salad. There's beer in the fridge and gas in the BBQ (I hope). Jen is en route from Burlington airport (don't ask), probably stuck at the border and swearing like a nun who just broke her vow of silence.    I'm listening to the  urlLink Prairie Home Companion  on  urlLink VPR , does this make me officially old? But I do have  urlLink Billy Talent  in my iTunes, maybe that balances things out. I wish I had Garrison Keillor's voice.

      Well I had to jump on the blog bandwagon eventually didn't I? My diary was festering in a pool of apathy and my plans to code my own blogging apparatus were just a pipe dream so I took the lazy option and came to blogger.com. Why re-invent the wheel?    Hopefully I'll fill this with enlightening, witty, sardonic, cynical and smartass comments. Or I'll forget about it after a week and it'll go to the great abandoned blog graveyard. We'll see.

      Our House is in the middle of our street. Sorry, channeling  urlLink Suggs  there for a second. We bought our house just over a year ago, a four bedroom cottage on half an acre of land in the heart of Beaconsfield. It's a great house, the bedrooms are a little small but we have nice bathrooms, a very functional kitchen, a massive family room addition thingy and a cool basement. Out back is a big deck looking out over our country-like garden.  We both love living here, but owning a house is a lot of work! Gardening, cleaning, decorating, maintaining, it all takes a lot of effort, money and time. It also doesn't help that we're incredibly lazy a lot of the time. It's all worth it though when we come back from a couple of days away somewhere and see what a great house we're coming home to.

      So Dan and Susan's newborn has been officially named, I lost the bet, his name is Simon Oliver. Very respectable and civilized. That also means his initials are SON, and as Dan's initials are DAN they are DAN and SON. Nice.  Yesterday Elisabeth and Richard came to visit and I used them as guinea pigs for my BBQ skills. I cooked beer marinated pork ribs, baked onions with rosemary and thyme, roasted garlic, baked potatoes and corn on the cob. All done in the BBQ, and all delicious, although the potato skins didn't go crispy.  We finished the evening off by watching  urlLink Fight Club . I don't think I'll ever tire of that movie.

      And Jen's an auntie! Jen's brother Dan and his wife Susan are the proud parents of a new baby boy. He weighs in at seven pounds five ounces and was born August 12th at around 4pm, after 2 days of labour (ouch!). No name or pictures yet, my money is on Gilbert or Oscar.

      After a week on my own, Jen came home from Toronto today. I picked her up at the airport, which as usual involved circling around the arrivals area until she came out, because they won't let you stop for more than a few seconds. We celebrated her homecoming with a sushi dinner then watched the Canadian Idol results show (yes Jen got me hooked, it's all her fault).

      Last night I ordered a chinese food delivery from Restaurant La Perle in Pointe Claire. It was a little late arriving, so by the time the nice man arrived I was standing at the front door with my nose pressed to the glass and my stomach grumbling loudly. The food was excellent though, probably the best chinese delivery I've had in this country. I just have one question.. Why can't chinese restaurants, or any restaurants for that matter, offer  urlLink single serving  portions? I got a bucket of fried rice and a large foil thingy filled with general tao chicken. Of course, I will wack the leftovers in a frying pan tonight and finish it off, but it would be nice to be able to get a delivery meal for one when I'm all on my lonesome at home.

      It's that time of year again. Part of Jen's job involves going to trade shows, and August is the time for the Toronto gift show. She left on Friday morning and won't be back until Thursday. I miss her already! The upside though seems to be that I am more motivated to do stuff around the house when I'm alone (ok not much more motivated, but a little bit). I finally got around to moving the server and router out of the closet in Jen's office and down to my workshop in the basement, freeing up space for her and giving the computers a cooler (cooler as in lower temperature, although my workshop is very cool in the other sense too) environment. I also attempted to tidy Jen's office, but that's a daunting task and I gave up halfway through.  The other thing I've been trying to do is recaulk the bath as we seem to have had some leakage recently. What a pain in the ass that is! The strip stuff thats on there is nasty and sticky and refuses to come off cleanly. I may have to find a supplier of undiluted acid to help me out. I finally managed to get one small area clean, and attempted to caulk it with the 'easy to use' caulk we bought. Easy to use is a relative term I guess, I'm now giving up and resorting to the same strip stuff that was on there before.

       urlLink Montreal , my city. I've lived here with Jennifer for four and a half years now, and I love the place. Montreal is a modern, cosmopolitan, vibrant and safe city with a long  urlLink history  in North American terms.  When I first moved here we lived downtown, which was a new experience for me, I'd never lived in the centre of a city before. I loved condo living, and I loved being so close to everything, but I guess there will always be a bit of country boy in me. Moving out to the 'suburbs', despite my initial resistance, has been just as good as living downtown. We're not quite as close to everything, but twenty minutes isn't that long, and the other advantages far outweigh that disadvantage.  We have a wonderful house on a large plot, which we probably couldn't afford this close to any other large city. Although it is the suburbs, it feels more like living in the country. We are a short walk from Lac St Louis, a short walk from Angell Woods and a short drive from the  urlLink Morgan Arboretum .  Every day I walk to work from the train station and back again, and I love the sights and sounds of the city around me. In summer Montreal is filled with festivals and a vibrant atmosphere. We've enjoyed the  urlLink Comedy Festival , the  urlLink Fireworks Festival  and of course the  urlLink Grand Prix .  Montreal rocks!

      Last night we had our monthly pub quiz at  urlLink Hurley's Irish Pub  on Crescent Street. A group of us gather there on the first Tuesday of every month for an evening of mindless trivia. Each month a different person (or people) write and host the quiz. This month it was our turn to host, with help from Kim.  We had eight categories, including 'Heard at the movies' from Kim, 'Jennifer's Hotties' from Jen, and a mime category from me. I'm not sure how good my miming was, but everyone got most of them right so I guess I did ok.  Tony's team won by a significant margin. Our goal now is to break their dominant run!

      For about 9 years now I've been playing a MUD online. MUD stands for Multi User Dungeon or Multi User Domain. The MUD I play is called Deeper Trouble. It's a text based multiplayer role playing game set in a vaguely tolkienesque world. For the last year or so I've actually been a wizard on the mud, which means I do the coding side of things, fixing bugs, writing new areas and maintaining the existing code base.  If you're not already hooked on the latest graphical MMORPGs and you're looking for a game that requires a bit more imagination and thought, then why not give Deeper Trouble a go? All you need is a telnet client, which you use to connect to deepertrouble.demon.net on port 4242. There is also a website: http://www.deepertrouble.demon.net/

      Today we drove up to the country to visit the in-laws. We decided to try out the ferry route from Hudson to Oka. It turns out the ferry is a barge pulled by a tiny motor boat. It was a busy day, so we had to line up for about 45 minutes before getting on the thing, but the journey itself was only 10 minutes.    It was the first day of the annual  urlLink Route des Arts du Grand Argenteuil , and Richard was busy showing off his  urlLink knife-making  skills.        It was also the day after the  urlLink Morin Heights Historical Society  garden tour, of which Elisabeth's garden was a featured attraction.
