       So, yeah, welcome to TroyGilbert.com, just like the title says. Watch this space as an interesting project is coming soon. What's that project you may ask? I don't know, but I bet it's related to games...

       Okay, here's the game design for the Single-Player project: Detours, the Game. Yes, I'll definitely come up with a better name, but I do feel as though I've nailed down the cornerstones of the design.  I was inspired while driving home one night. I noticed a detour sign on a side street and wondered what would happen if I just blindly followed the detour sign without thinking much about my route. After a bit of tumbling around in my head I came to he basics of a game design, somewhat of a puzzle game based around detours. Here's the basics, to be expanded on when I put together a proper design doc:  The playing field for the game is an overhead view of city streets, divided into a standard block-n-streets grid. Cars begin entering from the edges of the playing field along the streets. The cars are heading for specific exits based on their color. The cars take the most direct route according to a standard path-finding algorithm. Along the way, there are parts of the street that are damaged or otherwise blocked to passage. The cars' path-finding does not factor these blockages so they will blindly drive straight into them. Most of these blockages will simply bring the cars to stop at the damaged road. The player must place detour signs on or before the damaged roads to properly re-direct traffic. The player loses if the cars back up so far that new cars can no longer enter the playing field.  So, that's the basics. Of course, there are lots of other details to work out, some of which I already have and will go into in more detail with the design doc. Also coming with the design doc will be the engineering task list.  Okay, ready, set, go.

       Just finished reading Chris Crawford's excellent book,  urlLink Chris Crawford on Game Desgin . I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in any facet of game development. It's rare to have such a serious look at the process and art of designing games.  Kudos aside, I certainly have some disagreeements with Chris. While he strongly encourages designers to move outside of established genres, and bemoans our industry's insistence on relying on tried-and-true genres, he invaribly falls back on his strengths as a strategy game designer when presenting new game ideas. The chapter that he devotes to games he'd like to design consist primarily of variations on classic strategy gaming. Not that there's anything wrong with that, the designs certainly sound better than most of the me-too RTS's that have been made, but they'd still likely be cast as a Strategy/Sim/RTS by any modern game player reviewing them.  Beyond the aforementioned chapter, though, he does touch on a few interesting designs from his past, of particularly note a game titled  urlLink Siboot . This game very clearly demonstrates the fundamental elements of interactive design as outlined in Chris' other excellent tome,  urlLink The Art of Interactive Design : verbs and nouns. To boil down that whole book in a few sentences (do read the book, please!): Interaction is at its most fundamental level a conversation between two parties. The conversation is broken into three steps: listen, think, speak. This of course is the canonical computational model of input-process-output. Speaking (and it's flipside, listening) can be broken down into two essential elements: verbs and nounds, actions and the objects they act on. Siboot presents a very nice mechanism (particularly for it's time in history) for presenting player with possible verbs and possible nouns.  To get to my point: while Chris does provide some much needed critical analysis of game design as a true, valuable pursuit, he unfortunately does not give many current games any benefit of the doubt. In fact, he dismisses the First Person Shooter genre outright while admitting he has not played any of its offerings since dabbling with  Half-Life . I would consider this tantamount to dismissing comedic films that followed Chaplin's  Gold Rush  as "more of the same." While I'd be the last to regard the FPS genre as the foregront of innovative game design, it nonetheless has progressed quite a bit since its humble beginnings in  Castle Wolftenstein 3-D ,  Doom  and  Quake .  Of course, what use would critical discussion be if we all agreed?

       Okay, here's the XGDX Proposal. Please don't take the "auteur" part too seriously. I'm still trying to figure out how to best word the final title. I've shifted more toward "lone wolf" as opposed to "auteur," it seems to have a (slightly) less presumptious sound to it.   A. Topic    Single-Player: Is Auteur Game Development Possible?    B. Abstract of Presentation   You can't open an issue of Game Developer or sit in on a GDC roundtable without hearing the inevitable pounding of the drums: game development is becoming ever more complex; budgets are surpassing $10 million; teams have grown beyond the 100 people. Many see this growth as our industry's inevitability, much alike our brethren in the film industry before us. A few, though, have peaked out from the hidden corners of weblogs and back-page editorials and asked, "Where is our independent market? Where have all of our garage developers gone?"  This presentation seeks to either prove or disprove the notion of the garage developer, or more appropriately, the auteur game developer. Given today's technology in digital video, things such as prosumer cameras and desktop NLEs, it is possible for a single individual to author a complete film, much in the same way a novel has a single author. There's no reason that games cannot enjoy the same advantages, particularly given the capabilities of today's middleware and desktop content creation tools.  The race begins May 1st. The finish line is September 1st, the entry deadline for the Independent Games Festival. Four months with a staff of one working part-time. The goal is to prove definitively that a quality, professional game is possible under even the most limited conditions.  The XGDX session will serve as the official postmortem: What went right, what went wrong, what got done and what didn't. The session will delve into what limits existed because of the minimal staff, limited production skills, and shortened development schedule. Additionally, the project will be tracked over the four months on a regularly updated website. The whole of the project will be out in the open for all to see, for better or for worse.   C. Target Audience   Anyone and everyone attending XGDX would be interested. In particular, the project will strike a chord with game designers and programmers. Being primarily a postmortem, the skill level expected would generally be beginner to advanced.

       If you haven't seen it, check out  urlLink Indie Game Jam . Definitely owe these guys a lot of inspiration. Perhaps one day I'll be invited to participate. Until then, I'll be running my one man jam with  Single-Player .  This year's technology was a super sweet 2D physics simulator. Very fun to play with. Casey Muratori and Ryan Ellis' hamster game was particularly fun, as was Jonathan Blow's spiders.

       Well, that was certainly quick. Yesterday I submitted a session proposal for XGDX and this morning I received my "acceptance" letter. So, here's the lowdown on  Single-Player :  On May 1, I will begin work on a game. I have until September 1 to finish it. That's the deadline for the 2005 Independent Games Festival. That's four months to take a game from idea to gold master. Just little old me working part-time.  What's the point? To examine the process of auteur game development. Design, programming, art and music, all produced by a single individual. How much can be accomplished? What genres can realisticly be tackled? What are the limitations and what are the advantages?  The XGDX session will be the post mortem for the project, October 9-10. Watch this space until then to be continually updated on the status of the project.

Part of the project will involve the  urlLink Independent Games Festival . While I was involved as a judge last year, I plan on entering this year. The submission deadline is September 1.  In a closely related announcement, the  urlLink XGDX (eXtreme Game Developer's Expo)  will be October 9 & 10. Today is the deadline for session proposals.

       Okay, so I've been terrible about working on the Single-Player Project, i.e. my XGDX and IGF game. To be painfully honest: I've been lazy. But, to avoid embarassment in front of my peers, I will now enter the infamous crunch mode and churn this baby out.  To give a bit of status on where things stand: I'm working on the game framework that will be the basis for the game. I have done some prototypes of some aspects of the game already: world renderer, artwork drafts. I have done some extensive (for me) designs on paper for the actual gameplay. I'm on the road right now ( urlLink Meltdown ), but will scan and upload these once I return home.  The game framework I'm working on is called  Sandbox.  I hope to outfit it with the basics for graphics, events, task scheduling, pack file loading, video mode configuration, input devices, audio, etc. Once it is a bit further along I'll post some design specs on it. I'll also probably put it up online so that anyone else who wants to take a peek can. There's nothing special in there, just all the boilerplate stuff any Windows game needs.  A colleague pointed out to me today how easy it is to integrate  urlLink Lua  into a game engine. I've always heard that, and figured it wasn't too bad, but was really suprised to see  urlLink how very easy it is . In fact, it inspired me to add it the Sandbox as well. Should be a nice little framework.

       Big news this morning. It came as a suprise to all of us foot soldiers at Criterion. We've been working with EA for the last several months, fairly intensely. I guess this means that they liked what we were doing...  GamesIndustry.biz has an  urlLink excellent article  about the acquisition. Of all of the articles I've seen so far, it is the most in-depth and interesting to read (seems they actually did the footwork of interviewing those involved as opposed to just quoting the press release).  I'll be curious to see how, if at all, this will impact by day-to-day life. It is definitely an interesting twist in the middleware saga, and like the above article mentions, a potentially major event in the industry as a whole.

       Okay... it's crunch time. Time to break out the glue and string. It no longer matters how elegant the code is. It just has to run.  Now about something useful. I've decided, after some sleep, that I'm going to go with Java's listener pattern, which is just a clean version of the  urlLink Observer pattern . Less data-driven, but quicker implementation.

       Continuing to push forward on the Sandbox game framework. Attempting to tackle the event system. I see three different techniques to choose from for the event system: Windows-style messaging, Java-style listeners, and the Chain-of-Responsibility pattern.   urlLink Windows-style messaging  takes the form of a message handler function (WndProc under Win32) that receives all of the messages. This function is then responsible for dispatching them appropriately, usually through a large switch statement. By default, your message handler will be notified of all messages without have to specifically express interest for them.   urlLink Java-style listeners  are very lightweight but are hard-coded, not dat-driven. In this case you create a class that handles a specific message (or group of related messages). The class handles the messages by implementing a specific interface for specific messages, i.e. handleMouseMove, handleMouseDown, etc. This interface works for implementing UI widgets but does not handle soft-binding of messages at run-time, or scenarios where senders and receivers are unaware of each other.  This is where the  urlLink Chain-of-Responsibility  pattern comes into play. This pattern separates sender from receiver. It also allows event handlers to prematurely discontinue the handling of events by simply not pass the event further down the chain. This seems like the preferred approach.  Well, not much more to say right now. The implementation is not finished so it may end up looking different. And it's 3:40am, so it's time to stop posting...

      Last night we went to the theater and saw a girl get her first boner. Then another girl gave her head. Sounds like family entertainment, eh?  Actually, it was just the warm-up act for the main attraction. We were sitting damn near the front row of the  urlLink Alamo Drafhouse . While this gives an excellent view of the relatively small screen, it also places you too close to the speakers -- considering that they are the only speakers in the theater, they are inevitably cranked up loud enough to reach the deaf drunk in the back, which results in a deafening ring in your ears the next morning.  So, you may be wondering about the two girls. Kat and Morgan were volunteers from the audience. The MC for the evening, who was wearing a  urlLink giant foam cowboy hat  and a pair of  urlLink brown and orange Adidas  identical to mine, had initially requested two girls from the audience with the condition that they be "fun." Lacking volunteers, he eased his requirements to include "semi-fun," and finally, "boring ass bitches." Fortunately for the crowd, someone in the "semi-fun" category finally stepped forward. Of course, they were unaware of the challenge that lay before them.  Morgan volunteered to get her first boner. They laid her down on the stage. The MC then called his assistant to the stage with a few props. The first was a box of  urlLink Krispy Kreme donuts . One Original Glazed was placed on the girl's crotch -- err, swimsuit zone. The assistant then produced a banana, which he peeled. He then offered to the audience a choice: straight or bent. The audience voted "bent," which was apparently the choice of every performance before. The "bent" banana was then inserted snuggly into the Krispy Kreme.  "Of course," to quote the MC, "no boner would be complete without some cream." The MC proceeded to crown the banana with ReadyWhip. He then invited Kat to join him on his knees. It was time to "service the first boner." And she did. To be honest, it looked as though she had done it before (or had at least received professional training).  What's the point of the stroy? Is 35MPH sliding down the ladder into a smut-ridden bog of sex and fart jokes? Well, maybe, but that's not the point of this post. The point is the follow-up to the opening act:  urlLink Spike & Mike's Festival of Sick & Twisted Animation . Two hours of non-commercial animation with a seriously non-PC slant. In other words, it was quite entertaining.  One particularly well-done animation was Happy Tree Friends, from the people at  urlLink Mondo Media . Oddly, I've been speaking with the artists at Mondo Media for the last two weeks, the whole time not realizing that they did  those  animations. In fact, I'll be visiting Mondo on Monday in San Francisco. (I'm working with them to develop a demo for our products and Alias Maya.) I'll be sure to get autographs for everyone.

      Sorry no posts yesterday - I was skiing. Uh, I mean I was sick - yeah that's it.  As far as the graphics for the page - I think we need to make a sincere effort to draw this stuff out on our own, without precedent or looking to see what else is out there. 35mph is a creation of our own and I believe everything within it should come from us - not anyone else. The graphics for the front page are only a small part of an overall feel that 35mph should have. It should all relate back to what 35mph means to the group and to each of us. A little mooshy (sp?), I know but that's how I feel. If I were to pick a website that has the same cohesiveness that I would like to see in ours it would be  urlLink Tool .  Speaking of Tool, Bennett - are they doing anything crazy (a new album maybe?)

      The Tall Grunge was really just a visual treatment, not necessarily a final product for a front page or a template for the site. Just an aesthetic piece, really.  I'm not quite sure where to go with a site template. I definitely agree with Heath that the template needs to evoke more of a gritty film-like quality, similar to the previous placeholder graphic form the Untitled piece. The Tall Grunge was something starting in that direction, but it's not quite evolved to the point of a template for the site.  Come on, guys... y'all surf the web. Do you guys not see anything out there in the same genre of what we're wanting to do? Any similar imagery?

      Here's another quick 35MPH treatment I quickly put together this evening in Photoshop. It leans more toward the "grunge" style, and it's tall, so there you have it...  &rarr;  urlLink Tall Grunge   I quickly picked up some free fonts from  urlLink Chank . I then picked up some grunge brushes from  urlLink Nocturna . For the background, I took a close-up digital picture of a colorful ashtray (the blue green tones) and some potting soil (the earthier brown tones). Mix it all together and you get what you get. Enjoy.

      OK - Troy, I know that you were just playing around with Photoshop but... I guess what I had in mind for a graphic library was more related to the old frontpage of 35mph.com. Maybe what we need to do is put our heads together and develop this graphics library. I really liked the screenshot from Untitled. It gave me a good film vibe.

      Prior to the primary photography for "Shadow Vision," I'll be setting up lights and recording equipment for a Tyson Foods Event. I'll be responsible for gels, constructing rigging for lights and assistant camera work. This will be February 4-6. Though I've been contacted about "Shadow Vision," I have not received an assignment yet. I hope to hear that from Ozark Film and Video or through Alder very soon.  By the way, I researched a little concerning Alder's "Winterfest" event at Meadowbrook. It appears to have been cancelled at the last minute for insurance reasons. I think it was going to be to expensive to do legally.  Lastly, could one of you send me an email describing how to put a link in the posts?

      Take a deep breath... we're about to go deep, deep, deep into the biggest 35MPH weblog post...  EVER!   My adventure today started with a link forwarded by co-worker Ben:  urlLink sputnik7.com . This site, dubbed as "the world's first real-time audio/video Internet entertainment experience," thinks of itself as a broadcast network. It evokes a possible template for our ever evolving, deeply beloved 35MPH.com. While sputnik7.com includes video and audio "stations," I was more interested in their video on demand. Herein you can find some great shorts, mostly of the digital variety. Currently on the front of their video-on-demand archive are their RESFEST picks. And here we go deeper...  First things first:  urlLink RESFEST . This is an "annual, global festival dedicated to showcasing innovative film, music, art, design and technology." Right. Sounds like everything we love to do, so these guys have got the right idea. RESFEST is a companion to what was originally a magainze,  urlLink RES . The magazine focuses on similar topics, obviously. Always cool, always expensive (shiny, glossy, thick pages, good binding, bi-monthly... about $60/year for a subscription).  Second things second: the RESFEST picks. Four of them stood out above the others as worthy of commenting. The rest are obviously the pick-of-the-litter as far as cutting edge shorts go, but we shall leave them as an exercise for the reader. My recommended viewings are the following:  urlLink  Sweet  ,  urlLink  Everything Hits At Once  ,  urlLink  Vision Point   and  urlLink  Tongues and Taxis  .   Sweet  has the most professional cinematography of my four selections. And for good reason: the cinematographer was five-time Oscar nominee  urlLink Allen Daviau , whose work includes  urlLink E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ,  urlLink The Color Purple  and  urlLink Empire of the Sun . But, it was shot entirely on digital video... so how did they get that spectacular "film-look?" The answer is simple:  urlLink The Orphanage 's Magic Bullet Suite. This suite of tools (plug-ins for Adobe After Effects) provide framerate adjustment, color balancing, and letterboxing utilties to shift digital video from Local-And-Late-Breaking to Cinemascope and beyond. There was an interview with one of the creators of Magic Bullet on TechTV; you can find the article  urlLink here . For a more in-depth review of the product,  urlLink check out this review from Ken Stone  and  urlLink this newsgroup posting .  The second short worth watching is  Vision Point . This short introduces a unique technique I've not seen before. The camera is focused on the horizon (or an object, like a mountain, on the horizon) during time-lapse footage of a car trip. The end result is quite hypnotic and his editing is synched with the music toward a very trippy effect. The technique, dubbed Tran Scan by its creator,  urlLink Stephen X. Arthur , is showcased in  urlLink a second short of the same name  wherein Arthur travels the Trans-Canadian Highway from one side of our neighbor-to-the-north to the other.  Arthur also did another short of incredible digital trickery,  urlLink  Transfigured  . In this work, Arthur took the collected works of abstract painter  urlLink Jack Shadbolt  and brought them to life through a multitude of digital techniques. An inspriation to us all!  The third (or fourth, depending on who's counting) short to check out is  Everything Hits At Once . This short was done by a local (to me at least, in Austin) web illustrator,  urlLink Divya Srinivasan . The short was done using a non-commercial software package dubbed Rotoshop. The look may be familiar to those who have seen  urlLink Waking Life  by  urlLink Richard Linklater  (of  urlLink Dazed and Confused  fame). Rotoshop was created by artist/programmer  urlLink Bob Sabiston  of  urlLink Flat Black Films . The software is very, very cool, and I recommend that everyone rent/buy Waking Life where one can find a behind-the-scenes demonstration of the software. To provide a more comprehensive look, here are some of my favorite links:  &rarr;  urlLink From the Waking Life website: Rotoscoping (QuickTime movie)  &rarr;  urlLink Wired News: Animating a Waking Life  &rarr;  urlLink Wired 9.02: Unreal World  &rarr;  urlLink Apple: The Dreamlike Animation of &quot;Waking Life&quot;  &rarr;  urlLink TechTV: Rotoshop Animation  &rarr;  urlLink Animation World Magazine: Dream Is Destiny: Waking Life   And last but certainly not least: a bit of traditional animation. Well, semi-traditional.  urlLink Mike Overbeck 's cartoons are made in  urlLink Flash . Flash was originally developed as a web-animation tool. And for those for a mind toward history, back in the whacky, halcyon dot-com days of the late 1990's, our intrepid blogger  urlLink Troy was deeply involved with Flash . Back to Mike, though... his cartoon  Tongues and Taxis  is featured in the RESFEST picks. It's fairly funny and cleverly animated. For a little (very little) behind-the-scenes footage see  urlLink his documentary on its making . Don't forget to check out his political cartoons on his website... they're good for a laugh.

      This nice little site was forwarded on to me from Elizabeth's cousin in Hawaii.  urlLink DFILM  is a "visual communications" company that makes various things for various people. The cool thing that they've done (I'm sure there are others) is something called the DFILM Moviemaker (you can find it off their homepage).  DFILM Moviemaker allows you to create little Flash films by choosing characters, scenes, backdrops and music. You even get to throw on a title sequence. It's not perfect: the choices of scenes are fairly limited, and the characters are not very generic, but it's fun to try to make something interesting within the limits they establish. It's an interesting idea, something I'd like to see more of on the web.  To introduce everyone to DFILM, I made a little one of my own:  urlLink My Homage . This link probably won't last forever, but it should last long enough for those here to see it.  To go along with this homage, here are some expository links:     urlLink First Prize: Cadillac Eldorado     urlLink Second Prize: Steak Knives     urlLink Inspiration: The Glengarry Mix

      A re-edit or (re-shoot?) is definitely in order....but a trip to Austin, for myself, is not in the forseeable future. But then again, neither was my trip to NWA for the holidays and I still managed to share a few laughs and a lot of drinks at the Lounge. Maybe we could work something out over a long weekend. At the least, a collective mindset needs to be re-established and start up on some fantastic new project.

      Just added a link to  urlLink TroyGilbert.com . This is my own personal blog devoted to the games industry.  For those that don't know, I work in the games industry. I don't make games, but I help other companies make their games (I'm a field engineer for Criterion Software -- we make various game technologies). This means I end up seeing the inside of a lot of games -- games like Call of Duty, Dead To Rights 2, and Kill.Switch -- instead of spending 18 months looking at one game. I think that uniquely qualifies me to share my slanted opinion.  Oh yeah, I play quite a few games as well. But doesn't everyone?

      Over the next few days I'll start uploading some of our past productions. Right now, there's only one 35MPH production on-line, and it's seasonal. Check out the  urlLink Happy Halloween Stopmotion Greeting .  The sets and characters were created from scratch by Elizabeth (actual size of house is about a foot-and-a-half tall). She also did the animation (over 600 individual still frames). I did the editing, sound and effects.  We used the following software:  urlLink Stop Motion Pro  for capture and rough edit;  urlLink Adobe Premiere  for final editing and sound mixing;  urlLink Adobe Photoshop  for titles; and  urlLink Sony Sound Forge  for audio effects editing. Some audio samples were used from  urlLink SoundDogs .  The entire production, from storyboarding to set construction, filming to editing, took about two weeks (evenings and weekends). We began by storyboarding. Unfortunately, we accidentally threw them away after the shoot was finished so I can't post them. The final video is fairly close to the storyboard, the only difference being that we originally intended to have a cat as well -- it was cut due to the difficulties in animating it.  The filming was done with a Sony DCR-TRV330 Digital8 video camera (several years old, roughly equivalent to the  urlLink DCR-TRV350 ). Stop Motion Pro allows you to capture multiple frames at a time and average them together. This virtually eliminates video noise and interlacing artifacts without introducing too much softening to the image. Stop Motion Pro also provides an onion-skin mode that allows us to preview the live image against the previously captured stills, making animation far easier than without it.  The video has been featured at the top of  urlLink Stop Motion Pro's Gallery ! It may not be the Oscars, but it's good company nonetheless.

      Okay, I think we've cleaned things up a bit... and moved ourselves to the proper spot, 35mph.com. How about that?  Direct your attention to the links to my left:  urlLink IMDb  and  urlLink iFILM . Notice how they either begin with or end with a lower-case letter. That's what we in the industry call geek-chic.  Seriously, folks... IMDb may be the single most useful thing on the Internet (outside of  urlLink Google ).  And iFILM... well, it hosts a great deal of the strangest stuff on the 'net (in video form, of course).  These two sites are great "first links." Why? Because they represent some pretty solid ideals for what this site will eventually become: useful -- and more importantly -- a place where you can find some of the strangest stuff on the net (in video form, of course).

      Nice Bennett... keep the ball rolling and keep sticking your big, fat wide-ass foot in all those doors. Commercials and such would be a good departure point for 35MPH to get some real exposure as a full-fledged company. Until all of us are in the same area again (who knows when that will be?) we should start a rotating location pow-wow. We can start in NWA then to Austin and then -- wahoo -- Jackson! What do you guys think? One rotation per year, meet three times per year. We could really get some work done.

      Just got another production job. Jones Productions from Little Rock hired me to help shoot a commercial in Bella Vista. This is the largest and oldest film and video company in Arkansas. It pays $150 for two hours.  CJ, Emery and I had a talk the other day about shooting some "knock around" footage for the Frisco and/or IHCC. This footage could be mere practice or used for televised advertising. I think businesses with the right kind of character would like to use a small production company to create unique, one of a kind commercials. I think, once we're all in the same area, we could make some serious start up capitol shooting these small projects. We've all talked about music videos before and I still want to do that as well. These two types of things could be a nice sized bite to chew for our early "money-making" endeavors.

      Damn... I didn't get stuff on last night either. I was up until 230am, just ran out of time to compress and upload the final product.  For  Untitled , I pulled a copy off of tape onto my machine -- I'm not sure if it's the right copy because it doesn't have any titles (didn't it have titles at the end?). Unfortunately, when we did the original edit on the iMac in the computer lab it encoded the audio in a format that can't be transferred off of the tape via Firewire. So, I had to capture the video then capture the audio using the line-in of my sound card. Then I had to re-synch the two (since they were captured separately and the audio didn't have any timecode).  Finally, I got all of that done. Last step was to de-interlace the footage and letterbox it. I didn't mess with color correcting it or anything because I was running out of time (a few obvious tries didn't look very good). All that remains is to compress the video down to a downloadable format, which is actually happening at home right now. Of course, we'll have to wait until this evening before I can upload it to the website... so check back then.  For  Blackbird , I captured it. Didn't have any problems (probably because I used my old PC's Firewire instead of an iMac to do the editing). I'll compress it as well and upload this evening.  I gotta say, guys, watching the movies made me pretty nostalgic. And I gotta say... we didn't do half-bad. The  Blackbird  shot is pretty cool (and it's just a rough, first attempt!).  So,  Watch This Space . Check back this evening for new video footage.  BTW, would you guys be interested in me posting scans of the storyboards and notes I have for  Blackbird ?

      Thanks for the compliment on the image... to be honest, it was only about an hour's worth of work, and far from one of my favorites. But it came out nicely. I forced myself to use only photos I had taken with my camera. In that photo are several elements: the cooking element of a stovetop, the stairwell of a parking garage, the asphalt of an alleyway, and the shaving mirror from my shower. They were combined in layers, using whatever blend modes looked interesting. I built the focus around the the stairwell picture, which would probably make a decent picture in its own right.  I'll try to get the  Blackbird  and  Untitled  stuff online tonight.

      Alright guys, I'm not usually one to get upset by crap like  urlLink this  but CBS and their executives are going too far. It seems they have forgotten about the equal opportunity for every American to speak their mind. And CBS is regulating it on a national and sometimes global scale. Once you have enough pent-up anger - send them an  urlLink email  and let them know that they and the rest of the Republicans are screwing their fellow Americans.  Here is an example of what I sent them:   The CBS executives must have their hands deep into the Presidents pockets in order to justify such a double-standard, which is becoming more prominent as Election Day nears. As such a large part of the national media, it is your responsibility to be a steward of the airwaves and ensure that all people can voice their opinions - which is a right of the American people. Your refusal to run the MoveOn Voters Fund "Childs Pay" ad while running and ad for George Bush's Presidential campaign is a slap in the face of all Americans and their right to speak freely. Furthermore, if your network runs Bush's Medicare ad - which is full of lies - then by default, you must run competing ads which portray the truth. Don't be a platform for a failed and corrupted presidency.  Heath Kuszak Jackson, Wyoming  Get Proactive!!

      I like it. Of course, like you say, it all depends on the writing whether it's Hemmingway-esque or a bad episode of  Saved by the Bell . I'll reserve judgement until then.  I think this group could very much understand the characters and the situation. While I wouldn't say any of us have been there, I think we could all imagine it quite readily.  It's also a very realistic concept in that the production requirements are minimal. Dialogue, location establishing shots, no effects. Unfortunately, the quality of the final product would almost entirely rest on the ability (and confidence) of the actors we had.  As a realistic show piece it would need to fall into the sub-twenty minutes category, which it sounds as if that's where you'd be aiming. This would land it cleanly in the "shorts" category of most film festivals (I'm sure that was your plan).  In regards to flashbacks: personally, I love playing with temporal structure and am envious of directors who do it masterfully. Obviously our past efforts have specifically been built around that concept. While we don't want to go overboard, it'd be fun to break away from the normal by playing an interesting twist on flashbacks.

      Howdy all!  After several false starts, I'm off and running on the 35mph blog!  More grabass from my blog, which is grabass from life as a grad student.    Alright...here's my life, and here's what I would like to do.  I graduate in May, pass through NWArk beginning of June, and then spend June and July teaching creative writing to high schoolers in Kansas.  After that, I've got no job, but lots of plans.  If I find work between now and then, I'll probably have a week or two to dick around, but if not, the tentative plan is for me to pull up in Fayetteville for a month or six weeks, and try to find some part-time work in production...work some commercial shoots or try to find a film in the area to PA for.    I also want to make a film, and since this is up and established and looking for work, here's my pitch.     Log Line  - A recent college graduate and his drug addict friend take one last road trip through their home state, before the addict unwittingly begins drug rehab.     Story  - Matt, a college grad, heads out to Nashville to start a job and find his life.  With him is Dennis, his oldest friend, who plans to start anew in Nashville again.  But Matt plans a stop in Little Rock to take the unaware Dennis to drug rehab.  The film chronicles the drive, and acts as a Hemingway short story, where they talk about everything but the problem that they both know is a wedge between them.    We're looking at 10-12 minutes, mostly taking place along I-40 as I see it, with the possibility of flashbacks...but flashbacks have the ability to take serious topics and turn them schmaltzy, and I'm interested in chronicling friendship rather than drug addiction...Matt believes this is their last road trip, as everything will be different once Dennis starts rehab.  And he's correct.  The quesiton at the crux of this -- how would you say goodbye to a friend?  I'm working out first draft in my spare time, and wrestling questions about how to make this a drama of the mind rather than an after-school special (which it could easily tend towards if not kept in check).  So that's that.  If it sounds interesting, let me know.  If not, I've got another short that could be easier to film.

      Excellent stuff, Bennett. Photoshop would definitely make it easier. But it never hurts to get your hands dirty. Sometimes the ease of Photoshop let's you fly by the better options.

      Sorry I haven't posted much lately. I've been smashed at work with a full plate. Just a bit of info...  For most of February I was traveling around the country talking to publishers about our latest tech,  urlLink RenderWare4 . It's something we've had in development for over two years now, and it still has another year before it will be finished. It's aimed at the next generation of video game consoles (PlayStation3, Xbox2) and is a complete re-write of everything we currently offer. Really cool shit and it's leaving a lot of people speechless.  March was pretty packed as well. I was at home in the office, but there were a lot of distractions. I've been working with a 3D tools company,  urlLink Alias , makers of the modelling package Maya, to create a "cinematic real-time" demo for current and next generation hardware. It's been really cool. I believe I've mentioned it before. I was working with art production house  urlLink MondoMedia , who famously have worked on the cinematics for a recent James Bond game,  urlLink 007: Nightfire .  The first milestone for our demo was GDC (which took place last week) and I only got the final artwork the Friday before. Needless to say I spent several long nights over the weekend working on this (until 4am Sunday morning and 5am Monday morning) because I had to get on a plane 930am Monday morning. Unfortunately, I didn't get it as far as I wanted to (just the environments were rendering, none of the characters or special effects). Needless to say, I was a bit wasted at the end of the day Monday after nearly 48 hours without a single full nights sleep.  Going on in parallel with the demo at work was  urlLink SXSW  at home. Elizabeth and I (as well some friends of ours, Ben and Jenny) picked up film passes. There were definitely soom good flicks and I wasn't disappointed with anything we saw. One of the highlights was  urlLink Bush's Brain  which we were at the world premiere of.   urlLink GDC (the Game Developer's Conference)  was last week. Pretty cool stuff. We were one of the most dominant forces there with a huge presence on the show floor and meetings with most of the top movers and shakers in the industry.  But beyond the business stuff, the week was quite interesting in the "after hours" scene. To kick things off, Sony hosted an invite-only party Wednesday night. I was lucky that my Sony meeting was during the day Wednesday so I was able to get a ticket. The party kicked off as a fairly standard one: more free alcohol than is healthy, a huge assorment of food and a very decent club DJ on the turntables. They had some interesting big-screen visuals with the music, most of them tape loops of random things. The night got really interesting when the main act came on.  urlLink The Crystal Method . These guys can put on a helluva show, even though it's just two guys who look like they just arrived from watching football/soccer game down at the local pub. The show was awesome. I was about five feet from the stage and the music was about as loud as I can ever remember music being. I'm worried that I may have potentially vibrated my organs into different positions with their ultra-low bass beats. I didn't have my camera with me, but a friend did and he promised to forward his pics. If you check out their website linked above, under the photo sections, there are some pics from their recent LOB tour where they stopped off in Austin (for SXSW) and the setup looked pretty similar.  The next night had two big headliner parties, one at the "cocktail hour" and the other post-dinner. The first was put on by Criterion (that's me) and Sammy Studios, a big Japanese video game maker who's been building a big American precense (the US division is a customer of ours). The second party was Microsoft's Xbox party: Risque Cafe. Unfortunately, Microsoft is not quite as good at throwing parties as Sony. I guess Sony has all of these bands on their payroll (Sony Music, Columbia), whereas Microsoft does not. They just had a DJ (but of course had the required copious alcohol and food). They did have freshly hand-rolled cigars, though because it's California, you had to head outside to smoke them (where you couldn't take your drinks -- tough choice for some!). They also had free massages, etc. I hung out for an hour or so shooting the shit with a friend while we finished our cigars then I hit the road for the evening.  So, that's what I've been up to. I'm about to dig into doing my taxes. How fun. Mr. Rolin Moe has asked to join our little blog to present an idea, so I've invited him to join. Rolin, take it away...

      I shot three commercials on Monday. It was "run and gun" all day long, but we shot inside a Lasik surgery clinic for eye correction. It was quite interesting and gave me an opportunity to experience fitting the gear for a full production into a tiny space. We also used some creative light tricks to enhance the color of the lasers and such. It was a really fun shoot.  I also may be able to do a little traveling soon. I have lots of loose ends to tie up first, but everyone else at work is done with their vacations, so maybe I could take a little time off soon. Let me know of anything in your respective locations that would be exciting and cool. This doesn't apply to CJ, as I know what is going on here all too well.

      Well, its been a while -- regardless, I have some news that may be of interest to everyone. A new film festival -- likened to the Sundances, Tellurides, and Cannes of the film world -- is springing legs in Jackson Hole. Called the  urlLink Jackson Hole Film Festival , it is going to bring top notch indie features and shorts to Teton County, Wyoming. All just in time for the Fall "off-season" -- which won't be an off-season anymore if this thing sticks around. I plan to attend and probably volunteer. Can't hurt to rub elbows with these guys.

      There shouldn't be any difference between expensive and cheap cards, except maybe additional features and additional firewire ports. Speed also shouldn't be an issue as most cameras can only transmit over firewire while playing back, so it's single-speed anyway.  The biggest difference is usually whether or not the card also supports other types of capture, or if it can support multiple firewire devices (my old one had three firewire plugs, my new one has two). There's also a new FireWire800, which is twice as fast as standard firewire and supports cable lengths up to 100 meters. It'll probably be useful for HD signals.

      Firewire is definitely going to be the best way to go for video. It'll come out of the camera in a lossless fashion, and at a fairly fast rate.  If your computer doesn't have a firewire port then you'll need to buy a firewire card. Should be in the ballpark of $50 - $75, and they usually come with some simple video editing software (similar to iMovie, which is what we used to edit  Untitled ).  You can also get 30-day evaluations of Adobe After Effects (motion graphics, think Photoshop for animation/video) and Adobe Premiere Pro (which is essentially the 7.0/CS version of Premiere). The 30-day evaluations are fully functional with no strings attached.  If you want, I can dump all of the Untitled stuff (and Blackbird) onto a DVD and send it your way. Does your PC have a DVD-ROM? If not I'd have to send it on Digital8.

I'd also love to take  Untitled  and chop it into little pieces and put it back together again.

      I haven't had the time or inspiration to work on the short I pitched you all earlier, but I've got several first draft shorts written that might suffice for production without requiring driving shots.     urlLink Music Short Film  (approx. 3 min)  urlLink Relationship Drama Short Film  (approx. 9 min)  urlLink Character Drama Short Film  (approx. 11 min)  The first is a short I wrote for the Coca Cola Student Filmmakers scholarship, required to be shot in 50 seconds and deal with the movies.  I thought it was very good, but the content might not be family appropriate.    The second is a short I developed last year, under the question "How can you love two people at the same time?"  Not a whole lot of people I've shown it to have understood it as I want, but I think it would be interesting on film.    The last one is a recent project, based on a moment in Harold Pinter's  The Dumbwaiter .  I finished the first draft tonight, in lieu of working on my thesis feature, due to inspiration and a recent harnekning to the opera  Faust .  There are a few character issues, and the turning point might not come off as strong as I hope.    Read 'em.  See if you like the general idea of the story.  If one of these stands out, we can try to adopt it as a summer project...do a few rewriters, work out equipment and production.  The first and last could be shot in one night, albeit a long night.  The second one would require two or three days of shooting.    And be honest in your criticism.  These are first drafts, so they aren't meant to be perfect, but if something isn't working, it won't get better if you don't bring it up.

      I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get a nice graduation bonus from some family members come May.  If it happens, I'll probably invest it into an XL-1 (selling for $2G on ebay these days, including XLR adaptor and other periphials), as my career plan is to write screenplays and shoot documentaries.  Regardless, if we've got a camera body (whether it be one we own or one we rent), borrowing lenses shouldn't be a problem...it might be the only thing that my UT film degree will come in handy for (getting free shit in Arkansas).    My thoughts on the car were either an old beast wagon, kind of like the one I used to drive...or something like the Suburban that Chris Cousins flipped in Alma.  But it doesn't matter...it's basically what we can get our hands on.  I'll write it as a Volvo, if only because it'll be more visual on the page.    And I won't worry about car shots.  Sounds like we've got it under control.  I'll just write it to write it and leave the logistics to the professionals.    I've shot a few films in my day, so I've got a pretty good heads up on sync sound and lighting technique.  And I've got a pretty broad stage theatre background, as far as actors are concerned.  That being said, as the writer, I will leave camera angles and cinematography and director's intent and really everything past original story completely to the board of supervisors.  Nothing worse than a writer/director auture.    Timetable (because it never hurts to think about it early) for me - in Arkansas June 1 to 8 for pre-production meetings.  Then in Arkansas August 1 to ??? (probably Labor Day at the latest), for time to shoot everything.  My presence is not imperative, but I wanted those who live out of Rogers to know what my schedule was in case we want to coordinate.

      First: I may have access to the Canon GL-2 through the summer.  Otherwise, I could borrow an XL-1s from work (if I leave my soul as a deposit.)  Second: My first ideas for shots called for camera vehicle driving next to subject vehicle. Though we couldn't do this for the whole film, it could look nice. I believe my Cherokee would support a camera man and equipment on it's roof if we make some sort of platform to stand on. This could provide for some neat and cheap driving shots.  Third: I just inherited $5,000. This is not a joke. Though a lot of it is spoken for, I will entertain ideas for 35MPH investments. I have purchased a nice tripod and a fluid head. I don't know if we're ready to invest in a camera, but I've already mentioned options for that.  I'm extremely excited about this.

      how about this... we find a car - preferably one of those old boats that our parents / grandparents drove back in the day - that has a massive dashboard clearance from the windshield. Enough to get the lens of the camera (another good question, what camera?) 1.5 to 2 feet away from the subjects and then use a fisheye lens to capture all of the in-car dialogue between both front seats. This might be a cool effect and would also allow us to show what's going on in the periphery (passing cars, etc.) while going at real speeds - maybe not 70 mph but not 35 either.   What sort of vehicle did you have in mind, Rolin?

      After watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind again, there might be a good way to incorporate the flashbacks into something like this.    I'm a writer, and I think specifically in the story...what steps do we take to evoke the wanted feeling, plotwise?  How that is directed doesn't matter to me, but looking at how you'd shoot a story like this, it would be best for us to spend as much time out of the car as possible, mainly because we don't have the production mechanism to shoot many driving shots.  We can shoot the driver very easy, but if they both sit in the front seat, that's a bitch to shoot, and if one sits in the back, capturing both in the frame is a bitch as well.  Hollywood rigs the camera up afront the car (or on a trailer behind), and we could do something like that (more back-window shooting rather than rigging, and knowing how bumpy that damn road is...), but it would involve going 35mph in the right lane.  Passing cars would kill the idea that we're going faster than we are.    So flashbacks might be the best way to go with this.  I can write it two ways...idea would be that we film the best written one, but hopefully the easy one to film is as good as the more difficult one.    As far as actors, I have no clue.  I don't know any real actors in the area.  I'm sure we could grab a few UA students to do it.  I don't mind working in-house, but the two main roles would be best done with professionals. Putting ourselves in such a project is best reserved for cameos, so we can focus on production measures.    I'll start drawing things out over the next few weeks, starting with a character sketch, then outline, and finally draft.

      So, as a working title, we'll call it the  Labor Day Project.   To get the most work done, we're going to need to enlist local professionals. Well, at least local top-ranked amateurs. Okay, okay... locals I happen to know! Elizabeth will of course assist in any way she can. Additionally, a guy I work with is interested, Ben, and his girlfriend Jenny would probably be interested as well (particularly if Elizabeth was participating). Both of them have art degrees so their interests definitely line up with our needs.  That brings our potential crew to:   Heath, Ben and myself  Elizabeth and Jenny (if we need them)  Bennett and Rolin (and Chuck?) if you guys can be here   That's between 3 and 8 people. That's a good size crew and would be very, very cool to have all of that input.  Now, onto what we're going to do...  Well, I don't have an answer, but I have a suggestion (sorry, this is a style suggestion not an actual plot suggestion). Along the lines of what I was mentioning previously about mixing medias and techniques, animation, live action, etc.  The drawback of video is that, well, it looks like video. Not so much of a problem these days as people are getting used to it, and video can be treated on the computer to look much nicer anyway. But, what I'd love to do would be to work in a format with a higher resolution than video. While we can't afford film, we can maybe approach that quality level through some clever combinations of tech that we can afford.  I think we're all familiar with digital cameras. Even my simple digital camera can take very high-res pics (4+ megapixels), and Bennett likely has access to cameras that can take both incredible pictures and high-res (6+ megapixels). Compare this to video, which is in the ballpark of 1 megapixel.  One technique I've been wanting to experiment with is mixing animation with photographic sources. This is called rotoscoping. Rotoscoping basically involves taking some source live action footage (film, video) and then drawing over each frame. See  Waking Life  for an example of this (and see previous posts on the subject). What I'm proposing is not exactly the same, but its close.  Using a digital camera, you snap a high-res picture of your location. You then video your actors doing the scene. In post-production, you take your high-res picture and clean it up, color balance it, whatever (give it a painterly effect, apply special effects, whatever you want in photoshop). You then take the video and rotoscope the characters. For the rotoscoping, you use something like a Wacom tablet and trace each frame of video to whatever detail is desired. You can then toss the video and drop the rotoscoped characters onto your clean backdrop.  This should give a very interesting look that combines realistic backdrops with very dynamic, organic actors that are hand-drawn animated. I'm going to try to do a simple test this weekend to see how this looks.  Some advantages of this approach:   It's unique, thus it instantly makes whatever we make stand out from the crowd of amateur shorts out there.  It improves the quality of what we can produce. It should provide much sharper, cleaner visuals than video because we can essentially work at film (or at least HD) resolutions. Also, the result is never compressed significantly so the colors all remain pure and sharp.  Because it is already very manipulated, we can manipulate it much further without it looking like a bad special effect. You can make an animated character "explode" and it look "correct" in the character's world; if I have live action footage and try to make a character explode it would require very polished special effects to not be distracting.  It opens up a wide spectrum of shorts we could possibly make. Because the result is so stylized, it begs that you use it on very stylized material, i.e. fantasy, sci-fi, psychadelia, Twilight Zone kinda things, comedies, anything you can imagine as a cartoon.   So, just throwing that idea out there. I understand if everyone would prefer to do something a bit more traditional. I'd also understand if you guys think this may be too ambitious. But, considering how often we seriously do this stuff I'm tending to go whole hog on this...  And finally, my actual project suggestion if we wanted to go with a technique like above: what about doing something based on the work of HP Lovecraft? A modern interpretation, maybe?  Just a thought...  Okay, quickly, be...  *bzzzt*   ... damn, didn't finish the post before my battery died (I'm sitting at a conference in Seattle on making Windows games). But, fortunately, a power-outlet was nearby.  Let me know what you guys think!

So, excuse me if I am taking liberties here Troy, this coming Labor Day weekend a 35mph rendezvous will occur in Austin, TX.

Kylie Neal came up to Rogers from her home in Little Rock to visit me and we began dating (I'm bad with the titles, but I think that's what you call it.) I also have started playing music with Jackson Jennings at Club Frisco on Friday nights, as well as random weeknights when we feel inspired. Both of these offer an outlet of sorts for my restless mind. If any of you are in the neighborhood on Friday nights, stop by and say hello to the band and to Kylie, who usually hides from her degree-having, good-job-working, financially stable life at my no-cable having, crap-job-working, starving-wannabe-artist-poorass apartment. I hope you all are well. By the way, if you haven't checked out Hunter's website, you should. Mad Props to H.Mack. Word.

      I think I have found a story that is extremely adaptable...H.P. Lovecraft's "The Outsider."  http://www.deliverance.mcmail.com/lovecraft/outsider.htm  I have forgotten how to format text in the blogger, sorry.   Heath

      Ok, so the first week of August is almost over. Labor Day weekend is going to come chugging around the corner before we know it. I think that we need to pick a story fairly soon and go with it so we can start brainstorming how and where and what to shoot for this thing. Rolin and Troy have mentioned that they both have some ideas on where to start in terms of translating a HP Lovecraft , William Gibson or Richard Powers work into a short. I think everyone involved (that is, three or four of us) should be able to agree on one of these and begin to develop ideas on how we can make it into a 35mph Production.  And as far as I know a preliminary head count for that weekend - someone correct me if I'm wrong - Myself, Troy, Bennett.  Rolin - will you be there? What about CJ? Who else? I guess we shouldn't have too many people...thoughts?
