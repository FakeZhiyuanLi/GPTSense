      (Click on the post title to go to IGN page)  This is going to be sweet!  The bad thing is that it is going to come out in December.  Eh, before you know it, Christmas will be around the corner and we shall have our own copy of it.  If a person gets the Collector's Set, you get a small statue of Minas Tirith, which looks really nice.  I got the Collector's Set of "Fellowship of the Ring," which came with the statues of the Argonath, the two kings of Gondor (Isildur and Anarion).  I passed on "The Two Towers" Collector's Set, in which is came with a statue of Gollum.  Looking forward to it!

      After a well-deserved sleep-in, Katie is making me go to "Art in the Park," an annual event during Crazy Days in Madison.  I'm not really sure what goes on there, but apparently vendors are selling stuff for extra cheap, but I really don't want anything.  Katie loves it, so I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt to accompany her to this thing.  As for Sunday, the race is on!  It's the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono, the race that Ryan Newman won last year in his #12 Mobil 1 Dodge.  Hopefully he can get his second win of the season, he came close last Sunday at New Hampshire, where he finished 3rd.  I'll probably end up sitting around on my butt, putting in some more rosters into NCAA Football 2005 and cleaning up, especially my office, since that's a declared disaster area.  No issues for me right now, I'm kind of worn out for the long week at work.  The Democratic Convention is over (big whoop!) and Bush is out on the campaign trail, trying to save some face for the November election.  Although I'm a stout Republican and Bush supporter, he's going to have to pull something out of his ass to win in November.  If anything else happens exciting this weekend, I'll post it on Monday.

      Well, "Frankie" has now officially invaded the house.  It's a little runt of a dog.  A weiner dog, to be exact.  The cats, Clovton and Bubba, cannot really know what to make out of it.  Bubba took a swipe at Frankie, and Frankie barked like something fierce.  I picked up Frankie to haul him out of our bedroom, and Clovton was sitting on top of our entertainment center.  She looked at me with a look like, "What the hell are you doing?!  You're supposed to do that to me!"  Playing "fetch" with Frankie is an experience in itself.  He's tries to pick up a ball bigger than his head, but his large mouth manages to pick it up.  It's almost hilarious to see him run after the ball, because he's airbourne half the time with his long strides, plus the fact that he's so low to the ground.  His ears are also quite large, so a gust of wind will actually pull his face back.  It's great.  At least it hasn't shit in the house yet!

      I got this in my e-mail.  I thought it was pretty funny.  If you had purchased $1000.00 of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49.00.   With Enron, you would have $16.50 left of the original $1,000.00.  With WorldCom, you would have less than $5.00 left.   But, if you had purchased $1,000.00 worth of Beer one year ago, drank all the beer, then turned in the cans for the aluminum recycling price, you would have $214.00.  Based on the above, current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle. It's called the 401-Keg Plan.

      It ends up that Katie and I are going to watch a friend's dog while her and her husband are going on vacation for a few days.&nbsp; The dog's name is "Frankie."&nbsp; I don't even know what it is.&nbsp; It's just this little scrawny thing.&nbsp; Kind of looks like a beagle.  But last time we doggie-sat for it was when Katie and I were living at the apartment.&nbsp; That thing shit everywhere, puked everywhere, and whined when we didn't give it any attention.  I told Katie I didn't mind watching the dog, as long as it's out on the front deck, so it can poop and pee and puke out there.&nbsp; I'm sure our cats, Clovton and Cassifer (Bubba) will not care for a dog hanging around in the house for a few days.

      Now the Twins are 3 1/2 up on the White Sox.&nbsp; How 'bout a little "HELL, YEAH!"  But there are talks that first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz will be traded before the deadline (July 31).&nbsp; Probably to Pittsburgh in exchange for pitcher Kris Benson, who's 8-8 on the year.&nbsp; It'll be tough to see Dougie go, since his glove at 1st base has been so solid for the past couple of years.  Playoff tickets?&nbsp; I'm still debating that (if they make it). &nbsp;I went to the playoffs two years ago, when they beat Oakland in the Wild Card and lost to eventual champion Anaheim in the League Championship Series.&nbsp; I didn't go last year -- kind of glad, since they had their asses handed to them by the Yankees.

      Eli Manning -- the biggest baby (along with his father, Archie) in the NFL -- has signed with the New York Giants.&nbsp; He got a 6-year deal worth $54 million, along with a $20 million signing bonus.&nbsp; For crying out loud!&nbsp; A worthy fantasy football pick?&nbsp; Not likely!&nbsp; Bitch should be playing for the Chargers.  Stud-Man Brian Urlacher pulled a hamstring in Bears practice yesterday.&nbsp; They said it's a pretty good pull, but no worries, he should be ready for the season.&nbsp; I still wouldn't give the Bears defense a consideration for fantasy football, even though they picked up Tommie Harris, the first-rounder from Oklahoma.&nbsp; Rex Grossman?&nbsp; Dark Horse, baby!  And back to Ricky Williams.&nbsp; Still a druggie!  &nbsp;

      This is a debate that has lasted since the dawn of video football games.  All of us has had the experience playing almost every football game out there, whether it was Tecmo Bowl and Madden on Nintendo, Madden and NCAA on the PS One, or Madden, NCAA, and ESPN on the PS2.  Last year, Michael Vick was hands-down the best player on Madden 2004.&nbsp; Nothing could stop the guy!&nbsp; He could run, he could throw the ball 80 yards -- he was just simply too tough to beat.  But overall, throughout all the football games I've played, it's gotta be Tecmo Super Bowl's Bo Jackson on the old 8-bit Nintendo.&nbsp; It's a no-brainer that this guy could run for over 3000 yards in a season while averaging 30 yards per carry.&nbsp; Along with Marcus Allen in the backfield, the Raiders were a team that was tough to beat.&nbsp; Also, an honorable mention pick, is Rod Woodson on Tecmo Super Bowl on the 16-bit Super Nintendo.&nbsp; Woodson, then a player with the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the return man on kicks and punts and was a defensive back for that tough Steeler defense.&nbsp; Every return pretty much had a guarantee for a touchdown.&nbsp; If an opposing quarterback had the guts to throw in Woodson's direction, he would most likely snatch it out of the air, and -- you guessed it -- would return it for&nbsp;a touchdown.  Who's your man?

      I've put some more rosters into the game, finishing the Big Ten and moving into some of the teams who finished on the Top 25.&nbsp; It's a time-consuming process, but I've got the time until Madden 2005 comes out on August 10.   How do I play the game?&nbsp; Well, when I'm actually playing as Michigan on defense, I don't even control a player.&nbsp; It's all up to the computer, so it can be a bit more realistic and not just have one guy (the player that I'm controlling) rack up all the stats.&nbsp; I like to even things out, see how players match up against each other, whether it is pure ability or even just the statistics.&nbsp; With that, then it's more valid when a player gets drafted in Madden 2005, adding to the realism.  Also, when I have a really quick return man on the kicks and punts, I don't even bother returning the ball myself.&nbsp; I let the computer take over, so he'll be tackled more easily and I'll have a huge field in front of me to chalk up some yards.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'll be returning the ball a long distance, and my offensive numbers after the game are going to be nothing.&nbsp; I'm a stats man (goes back to those Tecmo days).  I rarely run the option, although I should!&nbsp; I used to run it non-stop in NCAA Football 2003 on the GameCube, since I had one of the fastest quarterbacks in the nation.&nbsp; The Triple Option is a huge play -- you can either hand it off to the fullback for yardage up the middle, have the quarterback keep the ball, pitch it to the halfback, or even drop back and pass it.&nbsp; It's simply deadly!&nbsp; Lately though, I've been huge on the passing game, although my wide receivers aren't worth a shit.&nbsp; Hopefully when the next season rolls around, their abilities will increase and dropped balls will be a problem of the past.

      It was probably one of the closest race I've ever seen on the game.&nbsp; Very exciting to see the vote totals come in.   My senior running back for Michigan, David Underwood, finished 5th.&nbsp; He had rushed for over 1500 yards and scored 20 TD's, but it pales in comparison to what the 1st and 2nd place finishers got.   In 2nd place, was USC QB Matt Leinart.&nbsp; He led the voting in 1st place votes, 2nd place votes, and still finished second in the running.&nbsp; As for the Heisman Trophy winner, that was North Texas running back Patrick Cobbs, who rushed well over 2200 yards on the season.&nbsp; Cobbs had more 3rd place votes, and in the end, finished with only 8 more points than Leinart did.&nbsp; In fact, now in real life, he was last year's leading NCAA D-1 rusher with over 1600 yards on the ground, and he didn't even play in 2 games that year!   Cobbs is going to graduate from NCAA Football and will be imported into Madden 2005, along with Leinart and Underwood.&nbsp; This all should make for a very interesting draft after the first season of Madden is complete!

      I have a new project in the making: "The Hanley Falls Nuclear War: The New Threat."  I've been working on this for a while, probably got about 100 pages written.&nbsp; This new story, is actually Part 6 in the long line, even though I only had Parts 1 and 2 written, back when I was a sophomore in high school (a LONG time ago).  I decided to fire this up again.&nbsp; I already told Mike all about it, how it's going to come together, and eventually come apart.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to give myself a little punch in the shoulder because some of what I write is so damn good!&nbsp; It's set in Wood Lake, in the ruins of Hanley Falls, and Mike's old house with his parents which is now the STUDS Headquarters.&nbsp; It's long, it's elaborate, and I really don't want to give too much away.

      We all know by now that Dolphins running back Ricky Williams retired.&nbsp; Eh, so what.&nbsp; The guy really wasn't right in the head anyway.  I'll give it up to Ricky anyway.&nbsp; He had the NCAA D-I record for rushing yards until Ron Dayne (Wisconsin) broke it, played a couple of mediocre years in New Orleans until he was traded to Miami.&nbsp; Five seasons of pro ball -- that's it!  But, I could care less.&nbsp; We Viking fans are used to it -- Robert Smith leaving after having tremendous seasons, but that was understandable, having 4 knee operations and puking all over the field.&nbsp; The only shock to me was when Barry Sanders retired, who in my opinion, is the best running back EVER to play in the NFL.  Good ol' Barry had some comments about Ricky leaving the game, saying something like "we haven't seen the last of Ricky."&nbsp; I was kind of taken aback by this.&nbsp; Barry was only like 1,500 yards away from breaking Walter Payton's old rushing record (now surpassed by Emmitt Smith) and he walked away with millions of dollars offered to him by the Detroit Lions.&nbsp; Why couldn't Barry come back, even under the new GM leadership of Matt Millen?&nbsp; So what gets Barry off, spouting that Ricky could make a return?&nbsp; Only that he's played 5 years?  It's a dead argument.&nbsp; Barry is never coming back, in fact, he's going to Canton.&nbsp; Adios, Ricky -- I could care less!

      Okay ... is this a publicity stunt?   I remember reading last month that Brock Lesnar, former WWE Champion, was trying out for the Vikings.&nbsp; Both head coach Mike Tice and former Vikings linebacker Scott Studwell said that he was "as raw as he can get," and he probably wouldn't have a chance in making the team.   Well, they've seen him work out and they're giving him a shot -- considering that he hasn't played any organized football since his high school days in Webster, South Dakota.   More than likely, he'll be on the practice squad.&nbsp; Who knows ... time will tell on this one, though I am a little skeptical.   More on this, here's the  urlLink Star Tribune  story on it.

      I basically completed the whole storyline of the game,  urlLink Grand Theft Auto: Vice City .&nbsp; Then, I checked out my stats.&nbsp; I've only got 55% of the game complete!&nbsp; I guess I still have a lot more stuff to do, but I probably will never get around to it.&nbsp; This game is absolutely huge.  In my opinion, Vice City is a bit easier than  urlLink Grand Theft Auto III .&nbsp; III was just plain tough, because I think that DMA Design (developer) re-defined the whole Grand Theft Auto atmosphere and it just became more refined in Vice City.&nbsp; Two great games, though!  Next up, is  urlLink Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas , scheduled for release sometime mid-October.&nbsp; Set in California, so things will be a little bit different this time.  P.S.&nbsp; I recently did a mission on Vice City that made me laugh.&nbsp; It was towards the end of the game and I was doing some missions for Phil Cassidy.&nbsp; Supposedly there were some gun runners going around disrupting Phil's business, and I needed to take care of it.&nbsp; There were about six trucks, and in the back of these trucks were crates filled with guns.&nbsp; My objective: knock the boxes out of the truck, break the crates, and steal the guns -- all the while I'm being shot at.&nbsp; After grabbing a couple of these new guns, a little message appeared that said: "They're getting mad, they're getting reinforcements."&nbsp; I replied, "Whatever."  Then I started to laugh.&nbsp; Apparently, their reinforcements were guys with guns, driving Vespas.&nbsp; I about died.&nbsp; I got a $100 bonus for running these guys over, so I made a bundle.&nbsp; After these guys were blowing out my tires constantly, I drove south to the docks, got me a semi truck, and proceded to blast these guys into the road.&nbsp; Talk about fun!!

      Great comments by the way, including Mike's e-mail stating that Sean has indeed bought and is playing ESPN 2K5 ... and loves it.  Sure, he can do that.&nbsp; I won't stop him.&nbsp; $20 is tough to beat!&nbsp; IGN.com gives ESPN a 9.1, and Gamespot.com gives it a 9.3.&nbsp; Madden 2005 has some hefty competition.  Is it the price that attracts you to the game?&nbsp; You're giving ESPN what they want!&nbsp; All what they're trying to do is take away Madden's market share.  When Madden 2005 comes out, are you willing to give that game a chance?&nbsp; What happened to the good ol' days -- when we road tripped to Sioux Falls our senior year, bought Madden '96 and rented a Super Nintendo (with a $50 security fee) and played that all night long?&nbsp; Madden '97 during New Year's at the Townhouse?&nbsp; Are Madden's days over?  You guys might change -- I will not.&nbsp; I will be forever loyal to Madden, not to some upstart ESPN game.  Sean, you backstabber!!

      In days of rising gas prices, it is pretty expensive for me to drive a Chevy pick-up truck with a V8 engine.&nbsp; I'll do anything to help out on my gas mileage, including my two new improvements to my truck, a new  urlLink K&N air filter  and  urlLink Bosch spark plugs .  I haven't checked up on my fuel mileage math yet, but already I'm feeling increased acceleration in my truck.&nbsp; The K&N air filter is pushing more air through the carburator, thus more power while not using that much gas!  Also, I'm using  urlLink Mobil 1  engine oil, a synthetic, to reduce wear-and-tear on internal engine parts.

      Some of you may know what Crash Productions is.&nbsp; For those you don't ... here's a "crash" course.   Crash Productions, Inc. is a little company that I incorportated in 2003, in which whatever I produce visually -- it falls under that company.&nbsp; If I were ever to make any movies some day, they would all be viewed under that banner, Crash Productions, Inc.   I also have a subsidiary called Crash Publications, Inc.&nbsp; This is for all my stories, or simply anything written down by myself (or others) would fall under this company.  I'm simply doing this just in case if I actually wanted to publish something.&nbsp; You could say this blog here belongs to myself and to Crash Publications, Inc.&nbsp; All of my home movies, or anything that I created with the computer visually would be under Crash Productions, Inc.  My future plans are this:&nbsp; I want to buy a new computer, preferrably a Sony Vaio -- which has to have a good movie program and a DVD burner.&nbsp; The reason why I chose Sony is because of the compatibility with other Sony components, like a Sony Handycam or a Sony Cybershot digital camera.&nbsp; Also, the Vaio can have a VCR hooked up to it, importing an analog signal and transferring it to a digital signal, which makes the images or motion pictures easy to deal with -- as in creating movies.  I can tell you that I have several tapes with home movies, whether it is the Dawson Road Trip, The New Year's Bash of '96, or all of the footage of The Owl Garden.&nbsp; I have created highlight tapes in the past just using a VCR alone, but with a computer, I can start all over -- have digital sound and have better transitions to the motion captured.  My future project is this:&nbsp; an Owl Garden documentary, like a 5th or 10th anniversary type of thing.&nbsp; As far as I know, The Owl Garden has existed since '93 or '94, and we've got tons of footage, either from Mike's old camera or mine.&nbsp; With that, make a whole new DVD with new music, interviews from the basketball players themselves, and so on.  I am a man of history and I have to say for all of the players who played at The Owl Garden, those memories will not fade.&nbsp; The competitiveness, the comraderie, and more importantly the friendships made on that grass-and-dirt court are there to stay.&nbsp; It's my mission, along with a few others, to make the memories live on because we simply cannot go back to the past and re-live them again.

      Big news from Lucasfilm!  Some of you know that I'm a big Star Wars fan.&nbsp; That's alright, that's just the "geek" side in me, which all of us should have some of that in us.&nbsp; Anyways, news was released on Saturday from the  urlLink official Star Wars  site that the new movie coming out in May, 2005 will be "Revenge of the Sith."  My reaction?&nbsp; It's typical -- George Lucas said he kind of wanted a title that reflect the previous Episodes (IV, V, and VI), so "Revenge of the Sith" would have the same ring like "Return of the Jedi."  As far as the story goes, the title fits.&nbsp; The Sith fight back against the Jedi, Anakin Skywalker turns over to the Dark Side and eventually becomes Darth Vader.&nbsp; Other people may be upset by this announcment, but it's all good with me.

      While I am not updating rosters on NCAA Football 2005, I'm playing EA Sports' MVP Baseball 2004, with Albert Pujols as the cover boy this year.  I'm playing through a Dynasty right now, with my team -- the Minnesota Twins.&nbsp; It's a fairly easy game to play with a lot of depth, but with a week to go before the All-Star break and a 70-9 record, maybe I should crank up the level a little bit.&nbsp; Kyle Lohse -- 14-0 with a 0.47 ERA.  I created my own player, maxed his abilities out, and ran him up through AA ball, AAA ball, and now is playing on the MLB team.&nbsp; "Tony" did well in AA, struggled in AAA -- then players like Torii Hunter and Shannon Stewart were struggling, so I brought up "Tony" and he's been ripping it up since.  The depth of this game in unbeliveable.&nbsp; Each MLB team has two minor league teams, representing AA and AAA.&nbsp; With that, as the GM, you have to keep track of several ballplayers -- like their salaries and if they're simply in a good mood or not.&nbsp; I get countless e-mails from my players every day (MVP Inbox), having players bitching me out for not getting any playing time or they're unhappy about their contract.&nbsp; DELETE!  The man for me this year is catcher Matt LeCroy, already hitting around .320 while blasting 42 home runs -- BEFORE the All-Star break.&nbsp; That a kid!  Who knows if I'll be able to finish the season or not, because we're getting into the influx of new videogames for the summer and early fall, like Madden 2005,  urlLink NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup ,  urlLink LOTR: The Third Age  and  urlLink Burnout 3 .&nbsp; I'll keep it up as long as I can, but I cannot guarantee of giving Minnesota another highly anticipated world championship!

      Mike and I disagreeing about which is the better game for the upcoming NFL season.   I say Madden, Mike says ESPN 2K5.&nbsp; Also, 2K5 is selling only for $20.&nbsp; That should tell you something!   Madden -- THE ORIGINAL.&nbsp; The game that started it all ... well, actually it was probably Tecmo Super Bowl ... but that's besides the point!   Mike is simply selling out for the cheaper game.&nbsp; It may look good and have all the off-the-field stuff -- just like MADDEN -- it don't make sense.   Mike, the Liberal.&nbsp; I thought I knew him better than that!

      The season has started for the Michigan Wolverines.  After dominating NCAA Football 2004 on the PS2 for 5 straight seasons (with 4 straight NCAA Championships), I decided to move on to the new addition that was released last week.  Michigan started out ranked 9th in the Coaches and Media polls, so working my way up to the top was a task.&nbsp; After playing the game for a while, it was a lot harder from the year before.&nbsp; The AI on defense was improved, but it could just be the team I was playing with, since I haven't done any recruiting yet.&nbsp; One of my closest games of the year was a 3-0 victory over Minnesota for the Little Brown Jug, during a rainy, cold game at Michigan Stadium.  Then came the big game against Ohio State, Michigan's rival.&nbsp; David Underwood, my halfback, put up some impressive numbers against their defense.&nbsp; I won that game, and the Big Ten title.&nbsp; I was currently ranked 4th in the nation, going to play #3 USC Trojans at the Rose Bowl.  Talk about a battle!&nbsp; Besides having players that really couldn't match up against USC's team, I held a 7-0 lead after the first quarter, then my quarterback, Matt Gutierrez, threw an interception and they returned it 74 yards for the touchdown.&nbsp; My kicker didn't fare too well either, missing two clutch field goals.&nbsp; Michigan simply didn't play very well, and I ended up losing my first game in probably over 100 games -- spanning from NCAA Football 2003 -- final score: 21-16.&nbsp; Michigan dropped in the standings from 4th to 7th, with a final record of 12-1, which isn't too bad.&nbsp; My coaching contract was extended 3 years for winning the Big Ten title, which I accepted.&nbsp; But I've got a huge beef with some of my players.  It's understandable in the beginning of a season that my players won't perform too well -- that's all in the controller.&nbsp; I'm learning the new plays on offense and defense.&nbsp; Offense is a lot tougher to master.&nbsp; Like I said before, the AI on defense has improved, so I'm always looking for those "bread-and-butter" plays which I can take huge chunks of yardage from the defense.&nbsp; As for Michigan's defense, I basically play a Cover 2 Zone, sometimes Cover 3, sometimes Cover 4.&nbsp; Rarely I do blitz, unless I have a dominating defensive line or quick linebackers.&nbsp; I'm going to wait until I do some recruiting to pick up some blue-chip players who are quick off the line to give the opposing offensive lineman some trouble.&nbsp; Back to "my beef" with the players -- my kicker was absolutely horrendous.&nbsp; There is simply no power behind that foot, even with the wind behind his back.&nbsp; He probably didn't make 50% of his field goal tries the entire season.&nbsp; Also, I'm super-upset at my wide receivers, namely Braylon Edwards and Jason Avant, the #1 and #2 receivers on my depth chart.&nbsp; Edwards ended up 2nd in the running for the best wide receiver in the nation, but he also dropped 20+ balls during the season.&nbsp; Edwards graduates now, so I'll be looking for new and fresh talent WHO CAN CATCH A BALL for the my next season.  Kudos to my halfback David Underwood and my offensive line!&nbsp; Underwood rushed for over 1500 yards on the year and scored 20 touchdowns on the ground, breaking the old school record.&nbsp; He came in fifth for the Heisman, third for the Maxwell Trophy (best offensive player) and third for the best running back in the nation.&nbsp; He also is going to graduate.&nbsp; But impressive is my offensive line, which all five starters made the first team All-America, and my center came home with the Rimington Trophy (best center).&nbsp; Super-happy with those guys, although in my opinion, they gave up too many sacks!  As you can see, NCAA Football 2005 is huge!&nbsp; I take it seriously, especially during the recruiting part during the off-season.&nbsp; I'll export the draft class (so they can be imported into  urlLink Madden 2005 ), then go off and recruit the best guys I can find for the positions I need.&nbsp; If I have any scholarships left, I'll go out and pick up the best guys for whatever positions, just so the other teams can't pick them up.&nbsp; The new thing to watch out for during the recruiting session is their GPA ... performance in the classroom.&nbsp; In the previous NCAA Football games, GPA wasn't really a factor, or not at all.&nbsp; Now, if a player cheats on a test, fails to show up for study sessions, or simply breaks team rules, you have to do something about it.&nbsp; Either you could let it slide, or make an example of that player.&nbsp; It just adds to the excitment of real NCAA Football!  As for now, the season is over.&nbsp; Oklahoma is the national champion, beating LSU.&nbsp; I'm currently filling in rosters with real names, so just in case if they get drafted in Madden 2005, they won't just be a number.&nbsp; More updates on this later!

      Well, I've decided to fire up the ol' Blog again, since there is a lot going on right now.&nbsp; It all ranges from life, movies, video games, and just plain opinions about stuff (a lot of them!) considering the current situations in the world.  I was kind of hoping to post pictures and stuff on here, but I have to route it through FTP to my server here at college, but I've decided against it.&nbsp; If I'm going to post any pictures on here, there will be a link available to click so you can be routed to that particular page.  Other than that, bear with me.&nbsp; I'm learning the new format of Blogger, since they've changed it here in the last couple of months.

      I started my Third Season with basically a new team.  New quarterback, new halfback, new fullback, four of my offensive lineman gone from last year, 3 defensive lineman gone, 2 outside linebackers gone, and 2 d-backs.  Although I have the best Recruiting class going into the Third Season, I red-shirted half of them, gearing up for the 4th season.  My first game was against Central Michigan.  Although I won 31-0, my defense is nothing compared to the Second Season.  My linebackers are slow and my defensive backs are already having trouble covering the pass.  Also, my quarterback is a lefty, so that took some time getting used to.  A bright spot though, is my new tailback Pierre Rembert, who is already averaging over 100 yards/game, having a great second game vs. Notre Dame for a 35-14 win.  Next up, the #1 Michigan Wolverines will take on their conference schedule with Wisconsin at Michigan Stadium.

      At work, a few guys I know usually have a "DVD swap meet" to trade movies and such.  Since I have a pretty large collection, they usually want to watch some of my movies and I get a little taste about what they like.  I usually have my judgements on certain movies through some of the teasers on TV, but I take my chances.  Last weekend, I watched "Eurotrip," which was supposed to be like "Road Trip" in a way, but it was worse.  Also, I took a gander at "The Transporter" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf."  "The Transporter" was a great action flick, although the dialogue was pretty poor.  The reason why I like this movie was all because of Jason Statham, the lead actor.  You've probably seen him movies like "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels," "Snatch," and "The Italian Job."  He's just a great guy to watch.  "Brotherhood of the Wolf," on the other hand, was simply a beautifully made movie.  I loved of the camera techinques, like the sudden speeding-up of the film and the sudden slow-motion of the action.  The story was simply suburb.  At first, I was all confused, then it just came together in this one moment and I simply loved it.  Another movie that I have to give mention to: "Once Upon a Time in the West."  This is an old spaghetti western, directed by Sergio Leone.  He also did "A Fistful of Dollars," "For a Few Dollars More," and "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."  Leone's work in "West" was unexplainable.  I never was a fan of the westerns until I watched Leone's films.  The characters were great, it has Charles Bronson and Jason Robards -- and the music to match the characters was something else!  I know that Mike is a fan of the western -- he actually wrote up a screenplay to be set in Wood Lake in a western fashion -- too bad we haven't seen it on camera yet!  I highly recommend "West" to anyone who wants to see a great movie.

      Katie had her ups and downs yesterday.  Let's start with the "ups."  On Wednesday, she sold her Pontiac Grand Prix for $2000, which isn't so bad considering in my opinion, it needs a new radiator.  So yesterday, she stopped down in Madison to a local car dealership and bought a '99 black Dodge Intrepid.  It is a very nice looking car and it runs great with 85,000 miles on it.  She picked it up for $5,200.  Now for the "downs."  Katie works at the local Dairy Queen, passing her time until I can get out of school so she can do her thing at cosmetology school in Minnesota.  She deals with a lot of wackos everyday, and I usually hear about it, until a couple of days ago when a really weird guy showed up in the drive thru.  This guy shows up at the drive thru window with a porn mag in the passenger seat, opened up to a centerfold.  This is no Playboy magazine, but one of the more "hard core" magazines where a person can usually see a woman's kidneys through an opening in her body (kidding).  This has happened two days in a row to Katie and rightfully so, she became a little worried.  This guy has been telling Katie stories about driving to Salem (to a strip club) and trying to kick guys out of town so he has a shot at some of the ladies who live there.  This guy is also employed within the city limits of Madison, and he's been going around telling guys there had he likes "younger women," and actually told our landlord's son who works there about how some of the girls who work at Dairy Queen are "hot."  Katie told our landlord's wife about it and wouldn't you know -- the stories matched.  Katie's all freaking out, so she is now locking the doors to our house and since I will be gone this weekend in Spencer, IA, she will be staying with her parents.  The Madison Police Department has been notified about this little pervert, and they're on the lookout for him.  Katie really didn't want it to turn into this because she is afraid it'll get back to her that she's saying stuff about the whole situation.  I told her that she shouldn't worry too much about it, but on the other hand it would be a good idea to keep the doors locked and be on the lookout for the guy at all costs.  I'm sure this little situation will blow over, but for right now, we're taking it a little seriously right now.

      (click on topic title for link)  IGN.com give Madden 2005 a 9.5.  It also gave ESPN 2K5 a 9.3.  Pretty even, the only thing separating the two games is $30.  I'm still going with Madden, because of my loyalty to EA Sports.  I'm sure Mike and Sean are happy with ESPN, but I'll be happy with my Madden.

      12 - 0.  How sweet it is!  I give all the credit to my defense.  They gave on on average 47 total yards/game, giving up only 13 points all season.  The defensive line was unbelivable, but the man was Scott McClintock, who re-wrote the record books for defense.  He finished out his senior year with 39 sacks, setting school and NCAA records, plus he had 9 sacks in one game, another NCAA record vs. Indiana.  McClintock also came in 5th in the Heisman Trophy voting.  Jerome Jackson - stud!  Surpassed the 2000 yard mark on the ground during the National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl vs. USC (yes, a rematch!).  Michigan won, 56-0, with a 200 yard performance from Jackson.  Jackson also took home a lot of hardware at the end of the season, including the Heisman and Walker Trophies.  Also First Team All-American and First Team Big Ten.  The offensive line was stellar yet again, with one of my guys winning best offensive lineman of the year and my center winning the Rimington Trophy for the second straight year.  I narrowly missed out on winning the Best Tight End Trophy with Freshman Mike Moss, who ripped it up.  Coach Lloyd Carr finished 3rd in the Coach of the Year voting.  There's so much about this team to be proud of, but I cannot list them all.  I had a great senior class graduating, plus Jackson and couple of other guys who are surpassing their senior year to move on to the pros (Madden 2005, second draft class).  I got a little smarter this time during Recruiting, giving more prospects more attention by using less points.  During my first Recruiting session, I had only signed 9 guys, but this year, I got 19.  Michigan was rated #1 in the nation as far as top recruiting classes go.  I missed out on getting a wide receiver that I was after, so I had to accept a walk-on.  Other than that, I got a pretty good incoming class of freshman coming in.  To top it all off, Michigan got the #1 spot in the Pre-Season Coaches Poll, while the Miami Hurricanes took the #1 spot in the Media Poll, with Michigan at #2.  For toughest place to play, Michgian Stadium improved from its #12 spot to #6.  During the off-season, LSU and Florida State both offered me 3-year contracts to coach their programs.  After winning the Nat'l Championship with Michigan and having already signed a 3-year contract with them, I'm going to be loyal for a while, maybe even possibly signing another deal after this contract is up.  Otherwise, it would be nice to take on another program in another conference to see what I can do.

      At work, this sometimes happens.  Anger -- just pure, pissed off at the world.  If you worked at PPD, you'd understand.  Lately, there's simply no courtesy between the shifts.  Everybody's pointing fingers at everybody.  We follow up first shift, they don't do their jobs, and we have to make up for it and plus all of our stuff that we have to get done.  But it's not just other shifts, it's simply some of the people on our shift that drive me up the wall.  There's no work ethic with these people.  We have one guy to contines to get out as much work as possible.  He complains that there is too much to do.  The only way to deal with it is just tell him to let it be and let me to it (you have to do it yourself to get it done right!) otherwise, just let him complain and bitch and tell him that he has to get it done.  Another situation with this guy is that we are continuously answering machines.  Once the part is "done," an alarm goes off, we take the part out of the machine, pour in powder or place a powder pill in the mold, and hit the start button - simple as that!  This guy just stands there and trims the parts, not even bothering with anything at all.  Then there is this girl, the gossip queen of the place.  You thought the last guy was lazy, she is worse.  Plus, she'll butt in on other people's conversations and ask stupid questions that don't even pertain to her.  All you have to say is, "Shut up."  This is not normal for me.  Generally, I'm a patient person, I'll take it as it is and I'll just do my job.  Lately though, I'm getting tired of being the bitch.  Some people just need to be put in their place.  I realize that this is a stupid rant, but this is what I go through day in and day out.  With a little more patience, I'll be at PPD for another year and I'll be done with its bullshit.

      This is going to be one of my busiest months in history.  Every weekend this month I have something going on, which is exciting, but it also has its downside.  This upcoming weekend, I will be heading to Spencer, Iowa to visit relatives who live down there.  My cousin Brady has repeadedly asked me to come down because he is now part of a pit crew for a team that races in figure-8's.  Yeah, that's right -- cars will sometimes collide in the 'X' of the figure-8, somehow making the whole race exciting.  Who knows -- I've never seen anything like this, but Brady assures me that this is the real deal.  After that, it is the annual Threshing Show back in my hometown of Hanley Falls, Minnesota.  I've been going to this thing like I was a little tyke, so this is nothing new to me.  Lately, the effect has been wearing off.  The only thing that I usually make it back for is the softball tournament, which is the premier tournament in the area that weekend, but yet again -- the tournament has lost some luster.  Also, there is a street dance uptown at the "Pop Shop," but eh ... quite boring.  But mainly it's to hang out with the old boys: Mike, Robb and whoever are partying into the late hours of the night.  It's always quite the challenge to wake up on Sundays to drag yourself out of bed to take the field with a hangover, but it's all part of the experience.  I will be available to play if anybody needs me -- I'm semi-retired, the knees aren't holding up too well anymore -- otherwise I'll be the drunken cheerleader for whoever.  On August 22, I will be in Brooklyn, Michigan to watch my first ever NASCAR Nextel Cup race, to see my favorite driver, Ryan Newman, take to the asphalt to seek his third straight win at Michigan International Speedway.  Hopefully I'll get to meet him when we venture into the pits -- he'll be driving a special paint scheme on this car, the Justice League; with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and others to make the car look somewhat patriotic.  In preparation for the race, I'm currently on the lookout for a scanner.  As a fan, you can pick up the in-car communications between the driver, crew chief and spotter and occasionally hear some colorful language.  I'm about ready to shit my pants, I'm so geared up for this.  And the last weekend of August, is Mike and Lacey's Housewarming Party.  Yee-haw!  It'll be Keg City I'm sure.  I've been to their new house before in Hanley, so it's nothing new, but now they're engaged to be married someday so we'll have to make the house warming a little extra special.  Maybe we'll just drink a little more ...  School starts for me on the 31st in Madison.  I'm excited, since it's going to be my last year in college and then I'll graduate.  The downside: limited time to spend with Katie.  Katie isn't coming along to my trips to Iowa, Michigan, or the Threshing Show, but she'll make an appearance at Mike and Lacey's house.  It's been hard on us for the lack of time spent together, but soon I'll be working part time at PPD when school starts.  Overall, quite the busy month!  Before you know it, it'll be September and football season will be here -- BOO-YAH!

      Wake up call?  Damn right!  I just don't think that they've come together as a team yet.  They've only practiced for a week now and played a few games.  Remember, this is pre-Olympics competition and there's nothing really to worry about.  But, this is the USA team!  They're supposed to be dominating!  Too many turnovers!  USA had 26 compared to Italy's 10.  That was the backbreaker, plus the fact that Italy was money from downtown.  Overall, I guess I could care less about the whole Olympics thing.  USA should win the gold medal, but now the teams that USA fields for the competitions will never match up to the '92 Barcelona team.

      Just this past Saturday, Katie and I stopped into the Cocktail (bar and lounge that Katie's parents own) and talked to Chris Hoff, a good buddy of mine and also a bartender there.  We got to talking football and plans are already being made up for our Fantasy league that we'll have later this month.  We have a huge set-up on Yahoo! Fantasy Leagues, so they automatically keep track of our stats and our trades, which is very nice.  Also, just reading through newspaper articles, they're saying very good things about the Vikings this year.  Besides the whole signing of Brock Lesnar, Michael Bennett is heathly and sports writers everywhere are predicting that he'll have over 1500 yards on the ground.  Of course, there is also Daunte and Randy -- but the big question is how much better will the defense be improved?  There is a new defensive coordinator in town (the 4th in 4 four years), so hopefully on the defensive side of the ball the Vikings can step up, compared to past years.  Plain and simple, the Vikings need to make the playoffs!  I'm also thinking about getting hooked up with ESPN's College Game Day package on Dish Network.  I'll have to look into it, because I really don't want ALL of the games being shown on Saturdays, but just a select few, like when Minnesota or Michigan are playing.  I cannot get the NFL package, since it's exclusive to DirectTV -- that's cool with me, since we'll get the Vikings on FOX every Sunday anyway and I'm not that really interested in other teams, unless I've picked them up in Fantasy.

      I'm currently working through my conference schedule, slowly moving up the standings due to some big upsets in the Top 10.  The big story is the defense, once again.  Through 7 games, I've only given up 6 points.  McClintock has been slowing down in the stats department, but he still leads the NCAA in 17 sacks on the season.  Jackson, my tailback, has taken over Michigan's single season record for rushing touchdowns, surpassing last year's record of 20 set by David Underwood.  This morning was a true test.  Michigan, ranked #3, played Big Ten opponent Penn State, who was ranked #8.  The defense came through huge in the first half, and Jackson racked up 166 yards on the ground on 20 carries, scoring 4 times on the ground.  FYI:  Jackson is in the lead for the Heisman!  Big disappointment was my fullback, Thompson, who was caught in an academics scandal when he was having other people take his tests.  I had to suspend him for 2 games.  I didn't have to, of course, but I wanted it to be as realistic as possible.  After the win against Penn State, #2 LSU lost to #25 Florida, so I now took over the #2 spot and got a foot in the door for the National Championship against #1 USC.  A rematch in the bowl game?  I'm looking forward to it!

      Jimmie Johnson wins his 4th race of the season this past Sunday at Pocono.  He pulls into Victory Lane and immediately sponsor executives place Powerade bottles on Johnson's car.  Johnson's got a contract with Gatorade.  Remember that.  Last week, NASCAR president Mike Helton decided to put his foot down on some drivers who knock down the Powerade bottles because they have ties to Gatorade.  Live and learn, I guess.  But on Sunday, Jimmie was smart.  He stuck a large cardboard cutout of his primary sponsor, Lowe's Home Improvment, right in front of the large Powerade bottles.  Evidently, the move cost him $10,000 -- but he didn't knock over the bottles.  For crying out loud!

      It was a bleak outlook on Ryan's situation going into Pocono.  Rains had poured upon the north-eastern part of Pennsylvania and practice was limited for Ryan and the rest of the Mobil 1/ALLTEL team.  Ryan only got one practice in, and that was Friday morning before qualifying.  Ryan ended up qualifying 30th (one of his worst starting positions) and the practices were scrubbed for Saturday due to rain.  In the beginning of the race, Ryan was having problems with the handling of his race car.  He would shuffle back in forth in the 30's, then pitting for an adjustment and tires, then pitted early again when he thought he had a flat tire.  During a restart, when Ryan was a lap down, Ryan started in the lead lap line, and was black flagged and had to take a drive-thru penalty.  Cripes -- two laps down.  Finally, the car came around.  Ryan benefitted from the "Lucky Dog" rule, when there's a caution, the first car a lap down or more will get a lap back.  Ryan got back on the lead lap and made the charge forward to finish 13th.  Overall, a stressful day.  Ryan was in 10th place in the points, only 100 ahead of Jeremy Mayfield.  There will be 6 more races until the cut-off, when the Top 10 in points will move to "The Chase for the Championship," starting at Richmond.  Ryan looked at danger throughout most of the day, especially when Mayfield had a great car, finishing Top 10, and if Ryan would have finished 30th or worse, his lead over 11th place would be cut from 100 to 40.  But there were so many cars in the Top 10 that had problems, like Kevin Harvick (engine overheated), Kurt Busch (tranmission), Bobby Labonte (crash) and Tony Stewart (crash).  Ryan ended up moving to the 8th spot in the standings, but still maintains a 100-point lead over the 11th place person, Mayfield.  It's a confusing point system at times, but it'll make for some exciting racing for the last ten races.  Next week, the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.  The Crown Jewel Race for the Summer.  Ryan placed 11th there last year after started 2nd.  Harvick won the race.

      I'm getting really tired of this working shit.  We've got three shifts out at PPD, running 24 hours a day, and everybody is pointing fingers at everybody.  Nobody knows courtesy out there.  I shouldn't complain, since I've only got a month left and back to part time hours (30 hrs/week).  Last week, there was a new job opening for the "bogie robot," a machine that takes the snowmobile bogie wheels and moves them down a sort of "assembly line" for robotic arms to insert bearings and snap rings.  I'm trained in on the robot, so I went straight to the HR Director and told her about it.  She said that she had already "thought of me" and she will consider it.  I would really like to get off the floor for once.  Our shift supervisor is retiring, a person who all of us on 2nd shift are loyal to, but I think I need the change in scenery.  Hopefully this week or next I will find out if I get the job or not.

      After filling 30+ teams with complete rosters for the draft in Madden 2005, I've decided to move on to my Second Season with Michigan.  Let's just say it was a huge surprise how they revamped the Recruiting portion.  Like the game, the Recruiting just got a lot harder and more stressful.  Now, you've got school budgets to worry about, like how much money you are going to give to your recruiting efforts.  There are couple of more areas, but I cannot remember them.  I had lost a lot of seniors due to graduation, and 3 of my All-American offensive lineman wanted to skip their senior year to move on to the pros.  I mananged to talk to 2 of them staying, while another decided to move on.  When Week 1 (out of 5) of Recruiting starts, you are given a certain number of points to use each week, and those points are given to high school prospects.  I only needed three target players: a tight end, an offensive guard, and a punter.  I managed to secure the top tight end prospect in the nation, but didn't get the greatest punter.  I also got a few more blue chip players to redshirt for their freshman years.  All-in-all, I only signed 9 recruits to scholarships, while other top programs, like LSU, USC and Oklahoma, chalked up 20-22 players.  Overall, I was the 10th best recruiting school in the nation that session.  I should have gotten more players than that, so after my Second Season, I'll use less points and go after more guys.  For the Pre-Season polls, USC was #1, LSU #2, Oklahoma #3, Ohio State #4, and Michigan was #5.  I've already made some progression through the Second Season, defeating all of my non-conference opponents: Bowling Green, Notre Dame, and Florida Altlantic.  That FA game: 97-0.  They're ranked 118 out of 119 teams, so it was pretty simple to do whatever you could do.  My tailback, Jackson, through 4 games has already 800+ yards rushing.  My quarterback Matt Gutierrez, who is now a senior, is a lot better, but still needs improvement.  I also played my first conference game vs. Wisconsin, and defeated them 48-0 through some stellar defense.  But the man with the plan is my strong side linebacker Scott McClintock, who has 13 sacks after the 4 games, setting a school record with 6 vs. FAU.  Along with McClintock, my defensive tackle Gabe Watson (pre-season All-Big Ten 2nd Team) and defensive end Pat Massey are "human wrecking balls" on the line.  I'm only giving up about 72 yards per game on defense, running a 4-3 Cover 2 or when I blitz my outside linebackers (McClintock and Pierre Woods), a 4-3 "Fire 2".  As you can tell, I'm having fun!  Next week, Madden 2005 is comin' out!

      As a Twins fan, it's sad to see that Doug Mientkiewicz was let go (to the Cubs), but in exchange for a minor league pitcher?  Kris Benson was a pitching prospect to come over from the Pirates, but instead, ended up playing for the New York Mets.  Usually, the Twins are very good in trying to hook something up for a little "oomph" for a run to the playoffs.  Last year, it paid off in dealing Bobby Kielty to Toronto for Shannon Stewart.  But this year, I'm up in the air about this decision.  Hopefully the front office, GM Terry Ryan has seen something in this minor leaguer who can become a valuable asset to an already tough pitching rotation.  Mientkiewicz really didn't have the bat in the lineup like he did a couple of years ago, but his glove was solid.  The Twins really haven't had a bat at first base since Kent Hrbek.  Now, with Dougie gone, Justin Morneau can fill in and with his bat and his ability to hit the long ball, hopefully shades of Kent Hrbek can return.  Joining Doug at the Cubbies is Nomar Garciaparra.  I would hate to be a BoSox fan right now.  Nomar has been rumored in the past couple of years to be dealt.  My opinion: the Cubs have a better chance at making the World Series this year than the Red Sox do.  Nomar deserves to play for a contender (even though the Red Sox are) but with the Red Sox and Yankees in the same division, it's not going to happen soon for the Red Sox.  Randy Johnson stays in Arizona.  No biggie.  That reminds me -- I was playing Arizona in my MVP Baseball 2004 Dynasty this past weekend.  The second game of the series featured Rick Helling vs. Johnson.  My player, "Tony," went 0-fer.  I wanted to clock a homer so bad off Johnson.  The Twins got the win and the save from J.C. Romero, extending my winning streak to 10 games.
