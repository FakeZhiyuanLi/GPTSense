      well, turns out mom didnt wanna go to the mall..but she took me to mandees and i got a dress 4 mar n jenns n britts sweet 16's- then me n ross went 2 kristas for a little bbq- umm ross threw me in the pool  with my clothes on - that was fun- so then i changed into my bathing suit and swam for a little- that was fun but ross started rough housing and trying to drown me, so we called it quits- we ate, tried to figure out who shot kristas house (from the grassy nole..)and ross told me how he planned out my life already..according to him im gonna be married to a guy named dan, whos a stock something for general electric..im gonna live in north carolina and drive a mini van- when my kids are like 14 im gonna get a job at anne taylor in the mall- one of my kids will be very rich but i guess ones a fuck up, so when im old the rich one is gonna take care of me..interesting life when i got home from kristas at like 6 my fam was here..i went to joes around 8 with dams kelly n brittany- joe n ross had maddd fireworks so we just watched those for like an hour..amanda n caitlin came.. but soon they left with kel n brittany to go 2 a party down the street so me n dams just chilled with like joe john ross james n kevin..some of them swam, james danced, joe made slushies...and that was pretty much it, but i had a lot of fun- mom n karen picked me n dams up at 12 and i went home yesterday i went to my moms friends house to swim- jen came..we swam, and tried to do cool dives but we suck last night me n jen went to kristas to watch a movie- ross was taking a long time eating so we started to watch the play grease that krista and joe were in from like 8th grade..it was pretty darn funny  ross came n we watched the texas chainsaw massacre..i was prepared this time cuz i saw it already, but i still jump a lot- its not really scary anymore, i just hate when shit pops out- or when jen screams.. after the movie ross went kinda phsyco and took out knives and stuff- it was actually pretty funny cuz jen was screaming..then he started throwing pillows but i have awesome reflexes..then he smacks jen with 1 and her soda goes all over the wall..oh what a mess..me n ross scrubbed the walls with fantastic but i was laughing too hard..i hope the stain went away after ross left me jen n krista watched true life about obese people.. and then i went home- i had work this morning at 8 but its tuesday so it was really slow- i was kinda bored most of the day but i didnt hate it- i got off @ 1 and now im gonna go for a run i think- its beautiful out i love summer cyaaa*    "i like it better..i like it..i like it better now"

       well..time to update this ya thinkk?    well..for   5   days i went to fieldhockey camp in  amish ville and let me just say it was hysterical..it was rough playing fieldhockey  24/7  and getting up everyday at 7 but it was worth every bit of it..i thought it was gonna get played out and annoying, but oddly it didnt- im not saying im gonna go out n play all day tomorrow, but im defenitly happy i went   we left sunday morning around 9 for a wonderful 3 1/2 hour drive..i slept most of the way, as did peluso kelsey n krista..we woke up at arby's like 15 minutes away from cortland- it kinda freaked me out..it reminded me of the weird gas station in the texas chainsaw massacre  we arrived at our dorms around 1230 and checked in..we couldnt request roomates but oddly enough me n kels were together- krista n jackie ryan were across the hall from us, and next to them was poor peluso with some weird girl  that day we had 2 sessions- we just played like half field games..the next 3 days we had 3 sessions a day- we woke up at 7, ate breakfast, 2 1/2 hour session, lunch, chill time for like 45 mins (no1 wanted to swim), 2 1/2 hour session, dinner, and at night we played 3 regular&nbsp;games  the last day i wanted to go home sooo bad but i knew i was gonna miss it- our coaches were&nbsp;all mad&nbsp;chill&nbsp;  me kels pel krista n jackie made the stay worthwhile lol- we did some funny ass shit- including writing poops on the dry erase board on the door of the camp director and telling all the hermit girls at camp about north rockland (they were shocked to hear we had security guards, and oh my god- people get in fights-  wow ..)  singing celine dion&nbsp;in the showers, or talking like we're from brooklyn n scaring all the other girls..then of course there was jackie doing her  human chicken , and dressing up with sunglasses, a towel on her face, and a dot in the middle of her head so she could&nbsp;scare girls in the bathroom and bang on peoples doors while screaming (all at like 12 in the morning)  but the   best   had to be the last day- we blasted "ghetto music" (according to the losers down the hall, who apparently didnt like it), left the doors open and danced in the hall way- our coach kaitlin heard it n came n danced too..it was madd funny  then for like&nbsp;2 hours we did fun relay races- we hadda do cool steamrollers down the field, in teams- bon joined us for that 1&nbsp;  we went back n packed our stuff n then played 2 last games- we tied both of them..although the 2nd one was the best game we've ever played, in my opinion--we got 4 offensive corners, which was really a first for&nbsp;us lol&nbsp;  there were numerous injuries, including kelsey getting punched in the face (accidently)..or hitting her head on the recycling bin cuz she was laughing too hard...or kelsey throwing me into the iron bed (i had a sheet on my head cuz we were scaring people..but i thought i was  on  the bed) apparantly not cause i have a debo blue/purple/green bruise on my arm  but nothing beats peluso being taken to the hospital in an ambulence..(shes okay now..lol)  good times...  &nbsp;  friday was brittanys sweet 16..that was a lot of fun- saturday i had work, and then&nbsp;at 630&nbsp;was meaghans surprise&nbsp;party @ her aunts..boy oh boy that was a fun night- me n ross&nbsp; did some kareoke- sweet home alabama..lol the rest of the night was hysterical cuz james john n&nbsp;mo were doing kareoke&nbsp;- i thought i was gonna die when james n mo did backstreet boys  after that&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;went back to ross's cuz james was moving the next day- im gona miss him..i hate when people move.. but anyway,&nbsp;every1 drank n smoked n shit but i just chilled.. u kno..took some cool pictures on ross's webcam..there was a little problem with me getting a ride home, so i ended up taking a taxi at 2 in the morning..my parents were sleeping when i got home so that was cool  sunday i went to the shore with my mom n&nbsp;olivia..hung out there&nbsp;till last night when we drove home..didnt do very&nbsp;much- the weather was shitty sunday so we hung out- monday was my moms bday so i went shopping&nbsp;in point pleasant n manasquan with her in the morning..then layed out by the pool with kate..then my aunts took my mom out 2 dinner so me n kaity&nbsp;babysat the kids n watched the parent trap  today i had work from 7-2, now im gonna go eat n walk up 2 gavins 2 hang for a little...then&nbsp;hopefully ill go out tonight..ive been so busy lately  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  damn  &nbsp;  ok..ttyl    &nbsp;
