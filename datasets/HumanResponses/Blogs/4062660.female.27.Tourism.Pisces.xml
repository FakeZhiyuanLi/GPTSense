      Ok. My first attempt at becoming a blogger. New words, new ideas, new programs on my computer!!  In an attempt to learn how to "do it all" I'm uploading a photo of Gary and me taken... by Gary himself! Although it looks like we are schmasched - we are not yet there. At least, I'm not yet toasted because I'm learning all these wonderful new skills of bloggerdom.  This is super cool! AND I hear Liz making more fun liqure drinks in the background. So I'm cutting this whole thing short.....

      Today was a tough day of touring.  How can taking a tour be tough you ask?  Well, let me tell you.  In the morning we all enjoyed being the tourists!!  That was so much fun!  4 hours of being on the receiving end of a tour.  It was great!!  We got to see everything, the bay bridge, Coit tower, the twin Peaks, the Chinese Pagoda, Pier 39 and all sorts of things!!  Then this afternoon, we gave the tour back to ourselves.  That was the funny part.  We didn’t actually know when we would be up and we didn’t know where on the tour we would have to speak and most of us have not been to San Francisco…  So it got interesting.  I was chosen to go first.  That turned out to be a blessing.  I got to show off Union Square.  And I got up there, nervous as I was, and starting pointing out what I was seeing.  Now, as we all know, I talk more when I’m nervous – but Randy (the teacher) said that it came across as energy and that’s a good thing.  That’s all good, but I was sitting up there trying to talk about everything I see out the window and I advertised the toilet sign off to the right of the bus.  J   Guess it’s important too.  So here are the photos I’ve been promising.  This first one is of my new friend Larra (like Sarah but with an L).  We were standing in front of San Francisco Bay and this is the beautiful skyline.     Here is me in front of the bay bridge…     I hear you can loose your heart in San Francisco – Cupid’s arrow is huge around here…     Here I am with 2 of my teachers Randy and Nicole in front of the bay area.     Here am I with my new study buddies.  Susi and Larra.  We are standing in front of the Japanese tea garden.  You had to pay to get in, so we’re just standing at the entrance.       Here I am with Thora at Pier 39 down in Fisherman’s Warf.       And here is my amazing shot for the day.  This was taken out the front window of the bus, over Randy's head and around several telephone poles...  The painted ladies of San Francisco     And last but very not least, Alcatraz

      Ug!  This is my second attempt at posting...  I lost the first one.  So, Today was much better.  We learned a ton of stuff.  I had no idea that tour directing meant I could do so many different things!!  Did you know I could tour direct for a bank!  There is this new wave thing where banks are sending good customers out on these tours as a thank you to promote business.  It's wild.    And I have a ton of homework tonight.  One thing is this long info packet on San Fran to read.  The other was to route a map.  It wasn't that the homework was tough - once you thought out of the box.  They gave us a poor map to plan our route for tomorrow and it sucked.  We spent a 1/2 an hour trying to figure out what to do when Susi found the consierge had a better map to use.  What threw us is that they gave us a specific map and said to use that one.  But we couldn't plot 1/2 the course!!  But a good tour director thinks out of the box.  Dang, I wish I could take credit for the second map...  oh well.  next time.  I've gotten in with some smart people who are here to make a living at this profession.  The others went out on a pub crawl.  I'm sorry, I didn't spend gobs of money to get toasted every night.  And although it took me longer to do the homework tonight (and I still have stuff to read) I know I'm going to be a better director then some others.  Plus, as Larra pointed out this evening (again I didn't even think of this) Ted and Randy are also observing us for recommendations to other companies.  They suggested we come 15 - 30 minutes early every morning.  I thought (origionally and stupidly) that this is still school and I don't come late to work...  so 10 - 15 is ok.  Dang, I hate  being wrong.  Thank God it's only the second day and I can still make some good changes.  I'll be there tomorrow morning 30 full minutes early - on the dot.  Tomorrow we will be taking our own tour and getting up on the bus to speak as well.  I'll be following along with my map!!  But I'll take a ton of touristy photos tomorrow and post some in the evening  - I promise Paul.

      I’ve learned that Bill Wong makes some of the best Chinese food in San Francisco!!  646 Washington Street is the home of Louie’s Restaurant.  Bill is a huge fan of tour groups and of ITMI (my new school).  We all got a round of free drinks – all 25 of us and a wonderfully huge dinner for 12.50 a  piece.  Ahhh…  good food and plenty of people that can talk as much as I do.  Can’t ask for anything better in life.  So, how was the class itself you ask!?!  Easy as pie today.  We spent 3 hours talking about what we will be doing for the next 2 weeks and going over out schedule.  (Yup, the same one that I’ve been carrying around and showing everyone for the last month)  Then we spend an hour where we interviewed the person next to us and gave a one minute presentation of that person in front of class.  That part was the second best part of the day!  What was the first?  I’m getting there….  I got to interview my new roomie.  Her name is Michelle and she’s from the Orlando FL area.  She currently teaches sales people different techniques for selling Tupperware.  But she’s very bubbly, very nice and I think we’ll get along just fine.  She actually came here with her mom, which is quite cool.  I’ve met a ton of people here who are so amazing!  And we all have this passion for traveling and talking and it has been really nice talking to everyone.  I can’t believe how well traveled some of these people really are!  We have one woman from Poland, one guy from Italy, one guy from South Africa and another man who has been to 75 different countries and has boasted seeing 13 out of 17 different species of penguins.  Ok, did anyone really know there were even 17 different kinds of penguins?!?!  So, the best part of the day was right after class.  Ted does this wine presentation for us and we had a wine and cheese party.  He had about 10 or 12 bottles of wine.  After explaining each one, he passed out a taste of each wine.  It was wonderful.  I met a girl – who is a true and  beautiful albino woman – who was allergic to the red grapes in the red wine.  So she got me to explain the taste and smell of the wine.  I felt like I enjoyed it so much more.  Tomorrow I’ll bring my camera around.  Today was just tiring with the traveling and the class and everything was a bit overwhelming….  Tomorrow should be better for pictures.  This is such a beautiful city!!  The weather has been quite nice.  A “heat wave” in the upper 70s!

      For those of you out there that belive I am sitting back, eating bon bons and enjoying boredom, I'd like you to know that I've been happily distroying rooms in my free time!  Please take a look at this fine example of painting.  It's kind of a love it or hate it design.  I personally can see all of my mistakes so I won't comment on exactly how I feel about the cabinate...     What this lovely pictures does not show, is the lovely drywall showing in the bathroom.  Yup!  Making the cabinates look old was only half the fun!  I took everything off the walls and stripped the wallpaper too!  It's been a fun week.    Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit with my dear friend Fatma up in Prescott.  I am so jelous she gets to live in this beautiful city!  Not only do they have lovely weather (it was perfect yesterday, with just a tad bit of rain to make every bloom just burst)  but they get cool craft fairs around their town center.  Truely a great city.  So Fatma and I enjoyed our time chatting and checking out the craft fair.  Sheela is one lucky dog.  She is staying there for the next 2 whole weeks on her own vacation.  And there are 2 other dogs to play with.  Life does not get better.  Today I'm working on the packing process.  Yes, I'm a nervous wreck since School starts tomorrow - but I'll try to keep that part to myself.  Especially since I tend to babble as I get more and more nervous.  :)

      Here are my promised pictures!!  All my stuff sitting outside of the pod...     A sample of Liz's awesome packing skills....     Liz also packed my car - floor to ceiling...     from the back window...     The dog's space for the ride...     I stayed in Gallup and really enjoyed the mountain view in the morning...     Here is Louie the Lumberjack at NAU!!  We rub him for luck too.  Not as cool as Liz's hippo, but handsome none the less!!!     Last but not least....  A shot of NAU's beautification program...  A great campus!! sigh.

      I did take lots of pretty photos today.  I took the promised photo of my stuffed car.  I took a photo of Louie the Lumberjack to compare to Liz's hippo (although that was a better story) and a few of the campus where I have fond memories of college.  Now with that in mind, I'm pleading with everyone (Liz) who helped me pack and move - WHERE OH WHERE did we pack the cable that hooks my memory card into the computer!?!?  It was purple...  Anyone seen it?  Do I have a chance of finding it somewhere in AZ?  Or am I better off buying a new one...   :(  A HUGE thank you to Paul who chattered with me until the wee hours last night so I could get into Gallup.  (I took a picture of the mountains in Gallup too!)  It was a pleasant and easy 5 hour drive with a nice long stop at NAU bookstore so I could buy things. Sheela and I wandered the campus, where they are adding fountains and things to beautify the place.  I showed her the student union and my favorite building - the language arts bldg.  I spent many hours there!!  I think she was most impressed with the little waterfall thingy.  (She could have been just thirsty though)  Phoenix is hot.  My sweet brother, who bought me dinner tonight, informed me that since we've had some rain the weather has been quite "cool" at 100 degrees.  And I have 5 days to acclimate myself to this "cool" weather before I jet off to "summer warmed" San Francisco with highs of 60 degrees.  I swear this country is backwards.  The fish are settled by the sink - I'm thinking its prime Real Estate for them.  Sheela is enjoying the Sun City grass and the many, many, many rabbits that live here.  She had a good run chasing several of them before I caught her again!  But hey, I waited a few minutes first before calling.  She really needed the run!  Tomorrow I'm re-arranging my room.  It has 2 dressers, 2 tables, 1 bed, 1 very large (and full) cedar trunk and 1 very full, packed to the gills, closet.  This, folks, is my new room.  My parents were kind enough to say they were coming home in September to help me re-arrange it all, instead of October.  I'm thinking it sounds like a good project for tomorrow so I can finally finish emptying out my car.  I know, a strange goal.  I did bring all those clothes.  I should at least attempt putting them in the same room as I sleep in.  Mom generously offered me the other closet.  I'm thinking that I don't really want to wander in their room looking for clothing...  At least, not after they get here.    Gee, Phili is looking good.  Now all I have to do is learn how to spell the full name and I can officially move there.  (Dallas was much easier to spell)  Ok, I'm on way too late tonight and am starting to make bad jokes.  Please let me know if you've seen my poor memory cord...  it's lost.  Also, since AZ is so odd with their time zones - we are currently on Pacific time and therefore I am 2 whole hours behind Dallas - please feel free to call me on the land line at any time.  The number is 623-780-0242.  Well, you can call anytime, but I may not answer at 3 am (or even 7 am, Mom)  I have no idea who is on the answering machine, but you can leave me a message.  I can retrieve it.

      Well, I haven’t had the opportunity to log on and update my blog much this week.  Needless to say packing simply isn’t that exciting and I didn’t feel the need to share what a long week of living in boxes it was.  I pretty much finished packing on Friday.  That is, I worked my rear end off all day packing and by the time Liz came to rescue me at 8 pm, I was really ready for that last burst of energy and lots of help she provided.  Thinking of everything, sweet Liz came early Saturday morning with Chick fil a for breakfast for everyone.  Never had it before, but YUM!  The funny part was that I was laying in bed thinking I had plenty of time before everyone showed up Saturday morning, when a nock on my door sent me scurrying for my robe!  NOT Liz!!!  It was Door-to-Door delivering early.  What a great service!  I must say, I was really impressed with the pods and with the delivery guy and the follow up service.  I definitely recommend them.  Again, due to Liz’s excellent thinking, everyone showed up early in the morning to pack the pods.  We were totally packed by noon.  It was perfect weather in the morning, humid, but cooler to pack and a really nice breeze.  So I decided I wanted to completely finish up the apartment and not have to go back on Sunday.  So Gary cleaned (thanks ever so much) and Liz packed my car (and got everything amazingly in there) and I ran around packing this, moving that and picking up the last bit of everything.  Poor Liz and Gary went home with a ton of stuff out of my fridge.  After a nice long nap, I was feeling human again (if not a bit stiff).  Gary and I went out to dinner in Frisco to Randy White’s BBQ – the best BBQ brisket in the DFW area – and actually got to meet and shake hands with Randy White!!  It was very exciting!  Sunday went by so fast – it was quite the blur.  Breakfast at Krispy Kreme, went back to my apartment to load the fish (packed in a cooler) and plants into my car, then a nice visit with Kelly O’Neil (a friend from church) and then off to the movies and my going away party.  One tiny hitch.  I talked too long with Kelly and thinking that the plants would be fine in our nice Sunday weather, I didn’t bother leaving until it was too late.  It was then I realized I could not leave my poor FISH in the car!!  So what do I do?!?!  I simply plan on explaining that these were my Seeing Eye fish and I simply couldn’t watch the movie without them.  If this logical reason wouldn’t work, I would resort to the truth.  This was their weekly field trip and they were dying to watch a movie with me.    The beauty of this whole situation is that NO ONE in the entire movie theater stopped me and asked me what was in the cooler.  I could have had beer….  The guys were extremely jealous.  They claimed they couldn’t get in with a coke!  I explained to them about the boob factor.  Obviously they work well.  :)  After seeing Collateral – a great movie even if Tom Cruse had a Richard Gere haircut – we went to Maggianos (again bringing those great party animals, the fish)  And AGAIN, no one even questioned me why I was carrying a cooler through a fancy restaurant.  I did have my excuse ready.  I am homeless now and I find it easier to pack any leftovers straight into my personal cooler for convenience sake.  But sadly I didn’t have to use that excuse either.  Then God smiled on me again.  Gary asked me if I had finished securing down the 3rd pod.  No, was I suppose to?  What’s in it?  The last leaf to my dinning room table.  Shoot.  Where am I suppose to find a blanket to wrap that in at the 9th hour?!?  What’s that?  Debbie has a spare blanket in the trunk of her car that she’s been trying to get rid of.  Sure I can have it!!  How lucky can I be!!!!  Thanks Debbie!  Liz made me 2 very nice gifts for the party.  I got a picture frame with 3 different photos of us in it that I will be hanging up on my wall right away.  I also got a stack of new CDs that have really helped pass the time in the car today!!  Thanks so much Liz!!  I made it until after dinner last night before I  burst into tears.  Much longer then anyone had anticipated (although I don’t know if anyone was taking bets or not….  I left this morning from Dallas around 9:30.  I made it to Gallup now to sleep – it’s 11 pm Dallas time, but only 10 local.  Sheela’s loving the hotel room.  She chewed on her foot while enjoying the bed and now she’s luxuriating by spreading herself out over the floor.  Because she can.  She’s done really well in the car.  She travels so nicely.  But this obsession of only peeing on grass is tough in New Mexico.  They can’t even grow trees around here much less grass!!  Thank God for Sun City grass.  She’d be hosed.  The fish did fine too.  No complaining from that quarter.  I’m hoping to be in Phoenix early afternoon to unpack some of my car and have a fine dinner with my dear brother after he gets off of work.  I have something to look forward to!!!  I’ll try to be better and post more frequently so I’m not getting this long weekend formats.  I know I’ve also bragged to many about the outlook of my packed car.  I promise to take a picture of how full it is before I unpack it!

      Not a whole lot new to add here these days.  Packing sucks and I'm not cracking to it like I should...  Instead, I've chosen to take the time (a whopping 3 hours) to sit in the beauty salon and see if improvement can be made.  So, here's my new do.  I took the picture by myself, so please understand the odd angle of me.  But the cool thing is, if you stand in front of the mirror, you can see the screen on the back of the digital to get yourself lined up in the shot nicely!!  I'm so clever!!     It only took me 45 minutes to figure out how to scale this picture down so it was postable size.  Please everyone, take a minute to appreciate it!!

      First, I would like to thank everyone involved to make this the most perfect weekend!!  Liz - my social coordinator and best friend.  I'm going to miss having someone simply tell me where to go to have a great time.  Friday night, drinks and a home cooked dinner.  Saturday night she arranged 4 day weekend in Fort Worth and dinner before hand with a great group of people!  And tonight was Paula Poundstone at the Improv.  What a great weekend.  And then there is Paul.  Normally, (without all the professional comedians) Paul is our constant comic relief.  Here's a pic of Liz and Paul that turned out very nicely.     Last but very not least - as my personal escort for this weekend, I had the most perfect gentleman accompany me to all these wonderful events!!!  I have to say that he made this weekend one of the very best ever!!  So, I'm posting our picture so that everyone out there can see what the perfect man looks like...  (I'm trying not to gush)     Needless to say, this has been an action packed weekend.  Gary and I also saw the movie "the village".  I can't tell you anything about it or it will ruin the movie.  I will say it had a good twist and I did enjoy it a lot.  I will end by saying this was an excellent weekend, which I will remember for a long time to come.  Thanks everyone!!
