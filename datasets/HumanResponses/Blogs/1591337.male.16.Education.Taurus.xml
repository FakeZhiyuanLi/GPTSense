      First it was furries. Then those various sub-cultures based on furries. And now, we have the  urlLink velvet worm fetish .     This is all your fault, Art.

       urlLink http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,10290030%5E2,00.html    Curse leaves Democrats red-faced   By Nick Buchan   July 30, 2004   AN on-air curse broadcast by CNN after US Presidential candidate John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech has left Democrats and network officials with red faces.  After Senator Kerry's speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, balloons and confetti were released into the crowd.   But apparently there weren't enough for DNC convention centre director Don Mischer, who was heard on voiceover urging workers to release more balloons and confetti.  'No confetti. No confetti yet. Go balloons. Go balloons. More balloons. All balloons. All balloons. Come on guys, let's move it," began a relatively calm Mr Mischer.  Soon afterward however the DNC director begam to panic.  "Jesus, we need more balloons. I want all balloons to go, goddamn. No confetti. No confetti. No confetti. I want more balloons. What's happening to the balloons? We need more balloons. We need all of them coming down... balloons.  "Go balloons, balloons... what's happening balloons, there's not enough coming down. All balloons - where the hell - there's nothing falling," Mr Mischer said, before finally exploding: "What the f... are you guys doing up there?"  A CNN announcer said sorry soon afterwards, apologising for the "profanity".     Cue Republican Outrage in 3...2...

       Who are you?   A political / computer geek from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.   Who am I?   A disembodied insight that will make rounds here every now and then.   What is this?   A Blog, my dear friend. More specifically, a rantground for non-secular and most-likely unkosher activities to occur.   Why?   Like all causes, from the kite to the atomic bomb: boredom.  - - - - -   Are you a Communist?   Between the love of the color red, and the constant Czarrist theme, I could come to see how you would figure this. But no. I'm more of an odd "Capitalist/Anarchist" kinda guy - almost Libertarian, except that I don't get so gung-ho about the FBI coming down in their flying UFOs and stealing our guns.   What are you like in RL?   Please, no abbrev. Anyway, in real life, it varies. When I'm online, if you approach me, I'm very quaint and calm. However, when I go outside, something involving the sun must happen. I become a bit of a fool. But regardless of the various times I've been suspended from certain structures for wearing women's cotton panties on my head, I play a little music (enough to make me seem cool), watch a little T.V., and read a little (very little - I have nothing against books, but I take a three-week investment with any book I read, and I'm very impatient. If it doesn't return in the first five or so pages, I'm out). I also know French. Well, no. But my girlfriend does, and I'm pretty sure foreign languages are contagious.   i.e. or e.g.?   Eh. More or less.

      You've seen it happen. You're in a forum, a chatroom, or sometimes even a public place, and someone with no sense of humor walks up. The hair on your head begins to rise as they approach - something is wrong here. They finally stop in front of you, and look up at you with pimple-faced joy.  "Hello", you say. Maybe "Hola", or "Greetings". It doesn't matter. He has you now.  "Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeee...."  Down you go. He has you now. You've lost. They have taken advantage of one of those unnoticed rules of society - The "Roquefort Effect", as I like to call it, i.e., as one's intellect or sense of humor dwindles, the use of the word 'cheese', especially in enlongated forms, tends to increase. I'm not sure why this is, but I guess somewhere deep in the brain, the word "cheese" has become an embedded device for human survival, somewhere right after staying alive and fucking. While most people can grasp and supress one's natural urge for utterly cheese, some people have barely progressed past basic social and evolutionary skills, and thus, the humor and social survivability of cheese becomes essential to them. The question now is, why?  Cheese, in itself, is not funny. It's an organism made from curdled milk that has an occasional obnoxious odor, and a delicious, if not strong, taste to it. Nothing funny about that - if you found that funny, I'm sure you'll also find the process of extracting rosin from trees for violin bows utterly hilarious. No, cheese is funny on a basic scale, because of two reasons - it's associated with mice, and it sounds funny.  Mice are funny. I'm not sure why, but they are. Perhaps it has to do with their caricaturized cartoon self, or perhaps the look of horror on their faces as a spring pops and sends them to their final doom. Whatever it is, mice are funny. I assume, then, that this causes a psychological pairing of cheese and mice, and thus leads to cheese being associated with humor.  The other possibility is, that the English word  of  cheese, is in fact, hilarious. Between the drawn-out "e", and the "che" that brings to life images of a Cuban revolution, the word does have a fancy for those with simple word association. Who knows.  Of course, there is a third and more direct possibility - that these people are complete idiots, and need to be put out of their misery. Thus said, if one sees a person using the word cheese out of context of the food, please do what one can do to make sure the incident never happens again.
