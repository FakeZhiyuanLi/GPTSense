      Hey guys today i found out that the saxophone parties are the best in the world. NO OFFENSE ERIC but i went to a tuba with non tuba ppl there and it wasnt as fun as ours. SO i think the saxes are the kings of partying and slacking off during marching band. Unfortunately last year we didnt keep up the streak for longest time without "section of the week" which was cool but wasnt cool because now everyone is starting to look at us more as workers than slackers. We lost some of the best saxes last year (mikey, steve, and max) and those guys taught us how to slack off even though they didnt tell us, we just watched them. Oh well so yeah go saxes and YES I CAN WAIT FOR THE THING ON SATURDAY.  Ok now back to eric morrisons party. It was actually pretty good since the number of girls increased dramatically and according to tyler, kurtis, and I, we decided there were 3 girls that we hot out of the bunch. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!! so yeah it was very loud because of some girls going crazy during a cranium game so me, tyler, and kurtis went upstairs and watched The End of Evengalism (i think). My first anime that i have seen and it was pretty good. So we need to watch another one guys!!!!!  Ok guys i hope u find morrison to be pretty cool and the saxes to be lazier than expected and with that said peace out and have a good one!

      hey guys today my friends tim and yuto fukashima left today which is sad! wahhhhh! we had a great from playing MVP Baseball 2004 to going to main event with eric, kurtis, tyler, and his friend thomas to bowl. so yeah give props to me for not killing myself one trying to understand what they are trying to say (english isnt too good). so yeah anyways i woke up and figured out how fast the summer went. My parents always say this saying " Time travels when u get older" which is totally true because of how much stuff we do, we forget about the time and stuff like that. It just sucks like in 2 days i start band camp in the hot texas sun for many grueling hours and in 2 years i graduate. so yeah think about what you really should be doing instead of watching tv or sleeping because time flies when ur having fun so live life to the fullest. Peace out and have a good one!

So yeah im happy right now but it didnt last long because I figured out that I have 2 weeks left until im dragged in the hot sun to march around in circles for many hours. THANKS CARROLL!! no actually it is pretty fun (except the heat) and I cant wait. So go Carroll Football! Peace out and take care.

      Hey guys today was the first day of marching band camp!!! WOOHOO!!!  This morning i was late getting there because I had a case of the mondays so Mr. J got pretty mad but I just blew him off so that started it off. It was hot and sticky and I didnt like it!!! I was sweating my balls off! Anyways it was really hot the whole time and no one wanted to be there. SO thank god mr. behrends finally saw everyone sweating their guts off, and so we went inside 30 MINUTES early!!!! So when we went inside my horn was so godly hot, i couldnt do anything on it. Then i didnt know if i was a whole step sharp or flat and my G# key kept sticking!!! So today was one of the worst days of the summer! oh well i gotta go to band again at 6 until 9 (im gonna miss RAW)! Peace out and have a good one!
