      It's time to blog, I feel good, but tired tonight, the silence is blissful husband to wife land, so that is super and life goes on  I think I got lots done tonight which will in turn help to ease the pressure, but there is always more there, so I don't just look at all of it with dread now as some things are crossed off.  I had a nice day with Kobi today, not too stressful, she is always so beautifully behaved when he is not around.  Well, time for a cuppa and a smoke and I am off for a early night.  Goodnight fellow bloggers.  D

      Yes, yes, I am the one giving it, not out of spite, just got nothing to say.  How could I have anything to say after all the nastiness that has spewed forth out of his mouth, I mean venimously nasty stuff, things you just don't say.  Forgiveness is the key I know, but how many times do you forgive, only to line up again.  I am so sick of the slamming doors and the tension.  I just want to take myself and my daughter away from all this, but how.  I pray that God will show me the way.  I do not like the impact it is having on my daughter.  Such innocent minds get affected so easily and I have done so much to keep her on the right track - to set her up well in her young years.  What is going to happen, where are we going, what am I to do.  Lord, I know you will give me the answers in your time, BUT, the time is now to know or do or change or whatever it is you have in mind.

      Morning world  8.53am Saturday morning, should still be asleep.  What to do today, have a cigarette, think about quitting.  Maybe go to the dump - major excitement!?*  See if I am allowed to have my car keys back today!!  Ooooh.  Husband and daughter are making pikelets.  As long as it is sweet for breakfast seems to be their motto.  Yes I am a pissed off wife, one who would very much prefer to become a single mum than go through the shit of having as ***hole for a husband.  I shall get off this bandwagon soon, just still in post fight angry mode.  Well, I shall just go for a wander around the garden and have a think about what's doin' today.  Bye all (that is if anyone actually reads my boring posts.  x

      Up working on a Friday night, the glory of being in business for yourself.  Too many bills to pay, too much stuff to do.  I must get a life.  I live in a quiet place, but there is lots of traffic around tonight, I wonder what other exciting things people do on Friday nights.  Can I really be bothered with it all is really the question I guess. Not really is the answer, I just enjoy working from home.  Am anxious re husband coming home, I hope he doesn't, it would be so marvellous if he was gone for the whole weekend, then my darling daughter and I can just have a nice peaceful weekend at home.  With no car I might add, in one of h's more glorious moments, he took my set of car keys off me, oh what a seriously unspecial person.  Aaagh, we are a happy chappy this evening aren't we.  I look forward to happier entries.  smiles. :)

      Well, this is new, I am not one to post stuff on the net and I am not sure if I really want it read, but hey, seems like a good outlet to get stuff out.  Days of Thunder, Days of Silence, my husband is out and that is seriously great.  I don't know where he has gone, but I am surely glad that he is out.  We are fighting, all started because I caught him drinking during the day and then all hell broke loose.  Would be good if someone realised that they are an alcoholic.  Life is not glittery at this day, but Glory to God and his mighty power he shall make it so.  Amen
