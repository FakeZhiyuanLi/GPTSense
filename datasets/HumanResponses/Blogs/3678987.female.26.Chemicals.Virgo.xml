      This is a little strange and scary just writing and putting it out here in the internet when I barely can understand it.....yup I'm a first timer blog virgin.  But I need this place to expound because it's true, everything is changing and quickly. I am on my last weeks with my last name. Do most women that get married have last-name-change anxiety? I can't stop thinking on it, it's like a piece of me will be leaving.....

      The night before last I had my first wedding-related stomach attack and slept for only about 3 hours. Yesterday it was pretty hard to deal with re-writing marketing emails over and over and over and only changing one little word each time, but that is the woe of the lowly ass-writer for the perfectionista.  So what I've decided is that I'm going spin my next days into a blur. I'm surviving on coffee alone as I attempt to starve myself in the hopes that my upper arm flab will dissapate.  Found out last night that another set of friends is getting married this fall. That makes 5 weddings this year and at least 1 that I know of next year. Soon the flurry of babies will start popping out of vaginas everywhere, the movement already having been spearheaded by the Parsells (http://tifandtheboyz.blogspot.com).    ARGH  Going to rewrite some more all day long.....

      This morning I come into work as usual, and it's a beautiful day so I open my window. That's right, I have an office with a window. AND a door. Anyway, I open the window because, well, I'm one of those crazy, crazy people that likes to enjoy the weather and the fresh air  And the summer breeze. It makes me feel fine, like rolling through the jasmine in my mind.   No sooner said than done when the other women come in and slap on the AC. They do this just because it's summer. Regardless of the actual heat quotient in the room. It's summer, so the AC should be on.   Each day I leave here with an awful headache and a snotty dribbling nose. No one cares that I haven't had fresh air since 1982. No one cares that I'm wearing a sweater. In summer. They are menopausal, you see, and apparently in anticipation of being even the slightest bit over their appointed 98.6, they have to condition the air in here to be about 60 degrees before the day even begins.  I would almost rather be in a windowless office building hiding in my cube than have the horrible teaser of an actual opening window that I just can't use.  Happy frieken summer.

      It's 8:40 AM. I've figured out how to use my sewing machine again, hemmed a curtain, hung said curtain, just put load #2 of laundry in the dryer, cleaned a bathroom AND watered all my plants. How about the rest of your lazy asses????  Oh yeah, and thanks to Laura, Jen, Heather & Tiff, I still look goooorgeous, dahling.

      Quoting scripture really isn't my thing, but there's nothing that I can think of now but this: who is anyone to judge me, or you, or your mom without casting doubt onto their own character? (Ok, who's amazed that I even KNOW any lines from the good book??)  I used to be a person who would gossip, who would toss judgments at others like rocks, but I like to think that I have become enlightened on this issue. Really, when you keep opening your mouth about people, it's pretty useless and usually only ends up making you look like the @ssh*le.  But when you pretend that you are doing it for "their own good" or for "the good of a child" it's even worse.  Know why? Because now you are not just jeopordizing people's reputations, people's jobs even, but now you are making it seem like you are better than said gossipees and also - you're probably inadvertantly lying.  So, I say this, let us all look upon others with kindness and a very open mind. Let us all keep our mouths shut unless there is something good to say. Let us all try and fix our own poop so that we don't feel the need to poop on others (is that how that goes??) - or for any CHS alumni out there - don't try to blow out my candle just to make yours burn brighter.  I have noticed that my last Mexican post was not right. Must have been that crazy keyboard (ok Heather, you were right, I was a little drunk). My apologies.   Remember to ask yourselves the three questions that Socrates asked of his students (BEFORE you say things, people, BEFORE!):  1. Do you know for sure that what you are about to tell me is the absolute truth?  2. Even if you don't know if it's the truth, is it useful/helpful for you to tell me this thing that you about to reveal?  3. If you answered no to the first two questions, is this thing you are about to tell me hurtful to the subject? If yes, lock it up and throw away the key.  T O L E R A N C E  R O C K S   Are there any queers in the theater tonight? Get them up against the wall. That one looks Jewish, and that one's a coon - who let all of this riff raff into the room? There's one smoking a joint, there's another with spots! If I had my way - I'd have all of you shot! (PF)

      While I was on vacation there was an "incident" at work. Now, I must preface by saying that the people I work with really can't compare to Laura & Heather's evil cube monsters, but most of them do rate very high on the ridiculous scale.    Apparently, the boss (who is not really sure how to manage people, but she just happens to own a company, that employs....people - that she manages) told one of the full time employees (there are only 3 of us, we'll call her "Z") that all the rest of the employees - every single one of us, by name, and going back to people that haven't worked here for two years - has come into her office and complained to her about Z.  Apparently the "complaint" that we have all made is that this particular employee complains too much!  WHAT?!   INTERJECTION: I'm trying to write this and the other people in the office keep coming in and telling me stuff about their work that I don't need to know, and I certainly don't care about, they just keep talking and talking and talking, and I'm ignoring, ignoring, ignoring......one of them walked away, praise Jesus for silence.   Ok, so anyway, my first day back from vaca, I walk in the door and Z announces to me that she's not speaking to anyone here any more.  She then told me the story. I don't know why, but I tried to explain to her that I never said anything to the boss about her, but she didn't believe me, I could see it in her eyes.  Now she sits in her car each lunch break (which incidentally, our boss insists that we all eat together at the same time like some sort of strange summer camp for losers) and the rest of us sit and stare at each other.  People - I never complained about this employee, and the worst part is, I don't think that anyone else here did either. I think it's an evil plot by my boss, who does think that Z complains too much (which is true, but you don't "tell" on other employees, that's so regime-like).  Boss wants Z to think that it's all of us, not her, that is sick of listening (which is also true, but unsaid).  So now Z is looking for another job. So is the other full time employee (3-2=1. ME).  Now we all know that I plan on starting school in the fall and how the hey am I suppposed to quit when I am the only one left????!!!  Oh and did I mention that I've now been here a year and received NO raise?  Heather and Laura just got a raise for no reason, just because they weren't making enough money.  Oh and did I also mention that I make at least 5 - 10 thousand dollars LESS than the rest of you a year? And - by this I mean absolutely NO offense - I think I have a lot more work to do than a lot of my friends some of the time, because I seem to have less time than some of you (wink wink).  Ok, I have to go now and cry. Why did I do this to myself in the beginning of the day? And I'd like to add that we have to clean our own office because it's "too expensive" to have someone come in and clean it and yesterday full time employee #2 found a mouse in his garbage pail. Alive.

      Here we go!  I'm in my last few minutes of officially being Eliza Hart Hansen before I go do the legal deeds.  I feel so sad, my only consolation is that I promised myself that if I ever published anything, I would do it as Eliza Hansen. But, sadly, I know myself all too well, and this blog will be the closest thing to being published that I ever get (I'm having a pity party later tonight and you're all invited).  So, as Eliza Hart Hansen, I bid you adieu and will be another woman when we next blog. Mrs. Adam LoPresti.  But just know, I will always be Eliza Hansen deep down inside.

      I need to vent.    I bring my own green plastic cup to work to drink water out of. The reason I do this is because we only have mugs here and they are dirty. No one washes them right, or rinses them all the way out, and the sponges here are at least 6 years old and totally infested.  I left early yesterday.  I now just wanted some water, and lo and behold - my plastic cup is missing off my desk, out of my office. I investigate. I find it in the sink with soapy water in it. So, I wash it out and rinse it off and go to yell at whichever troglodite has moved my cup.  It was employee Y, who tells me that he washed it because he used it to catch a mouse in after I left. Yup, he went into my office and took my personal cup and used it to catch a frieken mouse!  He tells me it is ok, since he washed it. I refuse to drink out of it. Would you drink out of this cup? Is my rage justified? I'm already plotting what I can do to get back at him and am accepting evil ideas....  And for those of you wondering- this is the second mouse this week we've found in here.

      Yes it's true. I am going skydiving tomorrow, and you never know what could happen.&nbsp; I'm not really worried, but just figured I'd take this precaution. &nbsp; If I never come back, the mighty girls can split up my clothes and shoes and anything else that Adam doesn't want.&nbsp; Oh, first make sure my mom doesn't want any of the shoes, she has a shoe fettish. &nbsp; Since none of you are truly single girls, please find a suitable woman for&nbsp;Adam in about 1 - 2 years.&nbsp; Tiff, if something happens to Steve, you know the drill, but just in case he keeps living, you should start looking now.&nbsp; Any other mighty girl is welcome to him if something should happen with your current relationship. &nbsp; Tell my work that I was planning on quitting anyway, I should have been paid WAY more for all the bs that goes on in this place, and that I actually died on purpose and told you all that it was because I couldn't take the job anymore, so I purposely didn't put on my parachute when I jumped out of the plane. &nbsp; Then, close my blog with a pretty eulogy. &nbsp; And don't cry! I love you all. Eliza

      I'm alive!  &nbsp; It wasn't even as scary as I thought it would be. Ok, it was scary. But I was let down, and here's why:&nbsp; I thought that after I jumped out of an airplane, I would be empowered, like wonder woman, I thought that I would feel all-mighty and afraid of nothing.&nbsp; But I just felt the same.&nbsp; Which leads me to believe that either A) I'm not as scared of things as much as I think that I am or B) I'm emotionally dead inside and not even jumping out of an airplane will revive my life's spirit. &nbsp; Once I figure out how to put up a picture, I will, but only because everyone needs to see how pretty Laura &amp; I looked in those wicked cool jumpsuits. &nbsp; Free falling was the best part, it was loud and exciting, and then as soon as the tandem master&nbsp; threw the chute, it was the most serene silence I've ever felt.&nbsp; Would have been more serene if I wasn't suddenly yanked into&nbsp;a vertical position&nbsp;by my inner thighs, but it was beautiful.&nbsp; It was actually very relaxing on the way down. &nbsp; On the way up was another story. I was the last person in, first person out of the plane. And the thing that bothered me the most was being in a rising airplane, sitting with my legs 2 inches from a door that wasn't really all that shut and thinking I was going to fall before I was actually attached to the guy with the chute on.&nbsp; Jumping was the easier part.&nbsp; Jen's sis Heather was right, it was actually a relief to jump out of that plane. &nbsp; Now can someone tell me - is it "skydived" or "skydove"?

      I think that I might have some advice for all you birth control pill takers out there: don't skip your periods.&nbsp; I read in some stupid magazine that it is okay to not take the last week of your pills - the week that Aunt Flo comes knocking.&nbsp; Instead, just get another pack of pills and start them&nbsp;after the third week of the first pack&nbsp;and - viola! no bothersome monthly period to deal with. Guess what people? It's just not right! Unnatural, even.   Well, of course I just thought this was a horrendous idea. But, when faced with the fact that I was going to have my period during - yup, you guessed it - my  honeymoon,  I decided that it might not be such a bad idea after all.&nbsp; Let me just tell you how much I'm paying for it now that I did take that last week of my next set of pills and allow the body to do it's job&nbsp;(well, since I don't yet have my MD, I can only assume that my current troubles are directly correlated to the skipping of the last period).   I'm dying a little on the inside. I'm retching, I'm pooing, I'm moaning, I'm crying.&nbsp; I'm doubled over with cramps, such as I haven't felt the likes of since the&nbsp;8th grade.&nbsp; I awoke with the feeling of&nbsp;sword fighting&nbsp;aliens in my abdomen at 5:00 am.&nbsp; I'm having hot and cold sweats and I haven't seen so much blood since....well, I guess since we watched Dawn of the Dead last Wednesday night.   You have been forwarned. Just go with the flow.......

       I was thinking this morning about my blog being named 'everything is different'.&nbsp; And I want to list the different things in my life because there are a lot of them. 2004 has been a life altering year for me (literally) and so far we are only a little more than halfway through! I've been feeling lately like something BIG is happening, or going to happen and I think really it's just all little things that add to my quality of life.  So far this year I've survived a wedding that involved too&nbsp;many people, consequently became married, and changed my name to something totally different than what it used to be, which is still such an odd concept in my mind. And now my relationship is different. I don't know why, I can't put my finger on it, but it's better somehow. And I have a freiken husband! And through it all I realized the horror that every teen thinks will never come - one of my best friends is my mom (and I'm turning into her)!  I met a bunch of new people this year and even though many of them have their serious failings, I pride myself on my new ability to accept them for who they are and hang out with them regularly (and no worries, these people of which I speak&nbsp;do not blog).&nbsp; This has been a real eye opener for me because I'm not flaking on people, I'm realizing we all have our shortcomings and that I stand in no place to be critical of anyone. This is&nbsp;how I've always wanted to think, but just couldn't get there. Something must have pushed me over the edge, maybe it's all the intolerance and hatred I see everywhere in the world this year, but it's definitely made me more accepting. Kind of like how Adam talks so much that I've become a&nbsp;quiet person. Which is a whole other blog.  I decided to go back to school.&nbsp; This is a big deal for me as I've been searching for the past, oh, 12 years or so, for what I want to do with my life (wiwtdwml).&nbsp; I think I may have found it and this has brought a surprising amount of peace and clarity to my mind - something I've never experienced before.  I started to practice yoga, which definitely made me feel good, especially since it's the first form of exercise I've done since I quit little league.&nbsp;   I jumped out of an airplane expecting to conquer all my fears in a 5 minute fall to the earth.&nbsp; That didn't happen, but I did realize that I don't need to do crazy things like jump out of an airplane to not be scared of stuff.&nbsp; But I like doing crazy dangerous things, I'll like it even better once we get that life insurance policy on me. Anyone want to try white water rafting next?  Speaking of life insurance, we've acquired a financial advisor, mainly because we don't want to end up like most of our parents (Adam's and mine I mean) and we are starting to invest young.&nbsp; This is something that grown up adults with money do, but Adam and I are faking it for now.  And I guess that's it so far. You may not think that any of these given things are a big deal, but they all have contributed to a totally new perspective on life from Eliza. I am happy. They helped make me happy. This is all new for me, people. The happiness has been creeping up on me for the past few years, and resist it as I might, it did finally take over.  I feel like someone else because, really, everything  is  different. It's awesome.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I went to NYC on Friday night to see a comedy show at the Gotham comedy club. It was fun.&nbsp;Adam and I got caught in the rain without an umbrella, we ate calimari and drank 4 glasses of wine at a wine bar in&nbsp;(literally) 4 minutes, we went out for hot dogs in Times Square at 3 am. But, the most fun part was when the MC made fun of my friend Brandon during the show.&nbsp; Brandon sat at the seat that was closest to the tiny stage and of course got asked the&nbsp;dreaded question&nbsp;during a break between comedians: Do you touch yourself?  Time actually stood still for a few seconds while I watched the angel on his right shoulder whisper into his ear "don't lie, man, they're going to know you're lying if you say no" and on his left shoulder there was this little naked masturbating devil&nbsp;yelling at&nbsp;him to say "no, I'm a good boy, no I live with a woman, why would I ever touch myself?!".  So he says that he does touch himself, right in front of this big crowd of people.&nbsp; Throughout the night, the same MC referred to him as "the self toucher right here" and now that is my new favorite thing.  *posted with permission from Jen, the self-toucher's fiancee

      I need to tell you all something - I'm out of commission until Monday. This is the end of a crazy work week w/ a crazy deadline. And I don't want anybody to think I'm ignoring!! Gotta run, being watched, being timed, phones are ringing, people are running by me - good thing I took that big fat vicodin this morning. I'll miss you. Comment me. Talk later.

      I've always had a problem with attracting crazy people. I am psycho fly paper.  My mom - she attracts mentally handicapped people - and I don't say this as a joke. She worked with them for so long, it's like they can tell she's sympatico. So....why do crazy people come to me??? I think to make themselves feel better.  Anyway, I had my first massage workshop tonight.  We went around the room and introduced ourselves and the chick on my right just happened to mention that she has total memory loss from a year and a half of her life because of the shock treatments.  Then I talk, and I'm what I consider to be completely normal, witty, pretty, and generally cute.  Then the woman on my left proceeds to burst out in tears because she needs a career change. Don't we all sister, don't we all.  I think what the hell I needed was a seat change.  Anyway, so of course when it comes time to do the hands-on portion of the massage workshop, I'm left in the cold when it comes to getting a real primo partner. Even the crier got a partner.  So someone says, oh don't worry, you can be partners with Rebecca, she went to the bathroom. She'll be right back. 3 guesses which one is Rebecca - and no, she wasn't the housewife across from me, or the high school teacher over a few pillows - she's electroshock therapy Rebecca, or Rebelectric as I will now call her. (Here's where I was going to say: names have been changed to protect my innocence -  in case Becks is a blogger, but f- it, I'm not going to pretend).  So we are starting and I'm air massaging (which requires way more skill than the air guitar) my invisible partner who's obviously taking a huge crap in the bathroom. Finally one of the assistants takes pity and lets me massage her. And I did damn good if I do say so myself.  After we are totally done with the first massage - over an HOUR - mind you, I figured that Rebelectric had gotten lost, or flew away, or got called home by her people or something.  Nope. She was "locked out" of the school the whole time. So she decided to walk over to McDonald's, eat some chicken mcnuggets, and put a hot fish sandwich in her car. Then someone went to the bathroom, saw her outside, and let her in.  So, she's back just in time for her to massage me, instead of the professional massage therapist that had been my partner in her absence.  The poor thing was shaking and fidgeting and kept saying "you are so bony, I'm just going to break you" and "of course I can find your shoulder blade it's sticking like a foot out of your back" and "I can't believe how smally your back is, you could use mine as a life raft" and so on.  Now, I realize that I'm not overweight, and especially not in my back.  But COME ON!!  Comments like this can really ruin the mood of the bad massage you are getting.  So there's no end to the story, that's about it. I'm going back for 7 hours tomorrow, so this should be very interesting and I'm sure I'll have more to report.  Stay away from the flakes, I know I'll be trying to.

      So the weekend massage workshop was a smashing success. I'm going to have a new career by April 2006.  I loved it, I loved every minute of Saturday.  This time, I got the high school teacher as my partner, and except for the surprise of a rather large Jesus fish tatooed on her back, there were no problems or complaints.  (please see previous post if you do not know what I'm talking about)  I'm either going to tell my boss that I'm going back to school today or tomorrow, we'll have to see how the schedule works out. Part of me just wants to get it over with and get it resolved, the other part of me wants to wait until something that really pisses me off happens so I can use this as ammunition.  I will post any developments.  Oh, and as far as what's going on in real life, we are getting a shed delivered to our house today.  Adam is really really sick.  That's about it. Peace!!

      So, as you may know, we got a shed on Monday. I planted 4 rose bushes alongside the shed. I watered them, I trimmed them, I loved them and prayed over them. I even got up early to play with them before work today (I've found that plants are much better to talk to than most people).  So when I just got home from work I found all the flowers taken off the stems, crushed, and thrown on the ground in front of each individual rose bush.  What the hell?!  I had even picked off a half dead bloom this morning and threw it about 2 feet into the trees behind the shed. That one was all strewn about as well. What kind of conspiracy is this? It may be my neighbor, Ernie. For those of you who have been to my house, he lives in the blue shack that we share a driveway with. He's mad that our fence (that was here when we bought the house) is not truly on our property, but 1 foot over our property line.  He rides around in a jazzy, so he has access to low-growing plants. HMPH!  Or if maybe Tiff or Tinamarie has any idea about what could be doing this, and how I should stop it, let me know.

      Random thoughts carouse through my head generally all day long, I need to get some out. And I need some ideas.    I'm thinking I want another tatoo. But I want this one to MEAN something. Originally I was thinking a dragon, small, on the back of my shoulder. I want it to symbolize strength, originality, and fearless-ness. Also, Adam would be open to getting a dragon too, not a matching one, but a general small dragon. Then I was thinking that all of you who want a tatoo could also get dragons and we could be a gang. But then I thought there might be something better than a dragon out there: any ideas? Has to mean something to me though.       This whole "terror alert" has gotten my panties in an uncomfortable bunch. I mean, I heard today on CNN that Britain received the same information as we did, and they are like, whatever, it's old news - and they aren't making a big national stink about it. Then again, Blair isn't up for re-election in3 months. I'm just so sick of my patriotism and citizenship being used as a pass for the fear express. It's such bs - and on the same CNN show, even the Republican callers were saying that they can't trust thier cowboy anymore. I just hope that people are catching on to the manipulation tactics.        People at work keep giving me cucumbers and tomatoes from their gardens. I have many. Anyone have a good way to prepare these? That ISN'T salad? I'm making cucumber soup, I'm going to make some tomato sauce and freeze it, and I made salsa for bruchetta last week. So I need something new.       We ordered our new carpet last night. We're getting wall-to-wall white shag, babies! (Ok it has little color flecks in it for when we spill or the dog drags his butt). When it's installed, I'm having a swinging 70's night at my house, and you're all invited. But you have to wear a robe.       I'm selling stuff in a community tag sale on Saturday at my friend's house. How do you price things for a tag sale? I have books, candle holders, a garden arch, little stupid things. Is there a blue book for these type of things? HELP! I want to get the most money, but I don't want people to think I'm ripping them off, get mad, and not buy anything. Or worse yet, shoplift.   That's all I have time for right now. My head feels lighter already. I'm having a neurotic day. I'm sure I'll be back with more questions.    UMMM I just tried to publish this and the bullets didn't appear. So, you may or may not see bullets. If you don't, I'm sorry, I'm sure this is way harder to read. If you do, then I'm hallucinating. Wouldn't be the first time.

      I thought I needed to do this too, and was struck with inspiration this morning as I watched my honey leave for the day:  10 of the 1,000,000,000+ reasons that I think Adam is hot:    He loves to clean and always picks up after I cook  He turns me on when he does "manly" things like mowing the lawn, using a chainsaw, and fixing up my car  He looks like such a Guido, especially when he wears tight shirts, and for some unknown reason, I've always been attracted to those damn Italians  He's so gentle and kind, but if anyone ever f*&cked with me or anyone in his family, I know he would kill them, or least beat them to a bloody pulp  He has dark brown eyes that twinkle brightly and mischieviously, especially when he smiles  When I stomp my feet and yell and have temper tantrums, he just laughs at me until I stop and then he gives me a big hug  Watching him interact with his neice is the best thing ever, he's going to be a perfect dad  He tosses and turns at night worrying about us being ok financially so I can follow my dreams by going back to school, he even wants to take a second job so I can go (but I won't let him do that)  He loves to learn things and researches things that interest him endlessly and that's sexy  He wants to live with me and be faithful to little old me for the  rest of his life  (bou a ha ha ha ha ha: evil laugh)

      I have a general dis-ease about work as many of you know. My current situation is this: they want to "let" me stay part time - you know, doing me a "huge favor" by allowing me to be tortured for longer.  The thing is this, I know what I do here, and I know they would have an  extremely  hard time without me, yet they want to act like they are cutting me this incredible deal and I should be kissing their asses.  So, I can stay part time if I take a pay cut (because the quality of work I will do as a part timer will obviously be much worse) and if I don't schedule things in my life the days I work. Seriously. She asked that I be available all day (and night) each day that I work.  Now, as part of my schooling I have to massage 2 people a week - every week - and as many of you know, I'm an adult with a husband and a family and a (gasp!) life.  As it is now I have something to do 4 out of 5 nights a week. AND I have family and friends out of state which means that I may want to go visit these people on weekends (what used to be my free time. THE HORROR!!).  They also want me to write up a statement and sign it that I will work certain hours no matter what. I kindly explained to them that I am going part time becuase I need to CUT my hours, not work the same hours, just at night.  So, I'm actively seeking other employment and I'm shouting it from the rooftops, I don't care who knows it.  The tangled web of shit here just keeps getting stickier and stickier and I'm like the fly who can't break free.     FOR HIRE  :  Normal person with straong work ethic.  Willing to work part time in office or from home office (will obtain DSL connection at no cost to you!).  Looking for boss that will play no mind games, will tell me what to do, will let me do tasks, and will then tell me if I messed up without calling a meeting or starting world war three.  I promise not to complain, not to steal or lie, and to work hard if you promise not to abuse me, make me feel beholding to you, or touch me in inappropriate lesbian ways.  Asking fair market value for hard work of any sort - no cleaning up feces, please.  HELP!!!

       Things that people say (quite often) to me at work that I find distinctly and highly annoying:       "  She/that/it gives me heartburn "  (referring to something like a person or a task that couldn't possibly be giving this annoying person heartburn. I suggest that it was perhaps the jalepeno ketchup doused over the mountain of fries at lunch.)    "  Find some poop out on this guy  " (this is how I'm told to research a potential author or speaker, usually highly regarded experts in their fields)    "  Put a tickler in your schedule for that  " (I refuse to think that a tickler is anything but a sexual devise and when disgusting people tell me to do this, I have a tendency to vomit)    "  People - it's five o'clock and I'm making like a goose and getting the flock out of here  " (repeated every single day no matter what)    "  Eeeeee Lie zzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  " (said in a loud, drawn-out, accented, whining manner - by a man, no less)    "  This isn't a complaint, just an observation  " (always preceeds a long winded, superfluous complaint disguised as something else)    "  Look,   I have sausage feeties  " (Yes, this is real. Said by a woman who's feet and ankles are so swollen that they often do make me yearn for a link or two, while she shuffles her feet in her 'sausage feetie' dance.)    I'm sure I have thousands more, these were all I could think of right now. In fact, I can't stop hearing these phrases over and over and over and - maybe that's why I'm crazy. What are YOUR favorite fun work sayings????

      Let us all take a moment and pay homage to my friend and yours: the cigarette.  When I have a day like I just went through, I can't stop thinking about how much I loved cigarettes, and how it really wouldn't be that bad if I started smoking them again.  Especially when I'm driving.  For former smokers, cigarettes are like the lover you tossed out when you finally realized that he was an abusive, cheating shithead: if you go back just this once, they think that they are part of your life again - they don't stop calling, they can't take a hint, and even though the smoking was hot and just like you remember it, they leave you feeling like vomiting the next morning.  How I long for the days when I was cool, when I hung out on the street corner with my sleeves rolled up and a butt hanging out of my mouth, when my words were neatly punctuated with the crisp crackle of taking a drag right in the middle of a sentence - this can be very effective if timed correctly during a serious bout of talking.  Oh for the slight head spin and random leg numbing of taking that first drag of the day - pure pure pleasure.  And by the way I still haven't figured out what you are supposed to do with yourself at a bar if you don't smoke. Any ideas? I want to meet random people by asking them for a lighter, really, without a cigarette this often fails. I want to bond with my co-workers and waste time by sharing umbrellas and smoking in shifts.  I'm getting excited just writing about this.  I want that long cylindrical stick in my mouth and I want to suck on it, ever so slightly, just enough to make the tip glow.  I want it to take my breath away with it's presence, I want to flick that filter, hear my fingernail POP a bit on the end.  I want to breathe in that tasty essence, visualize it filling me up on the inside, swirling, dancing in my belly.  I want to roll those babies around in my fingers and smell that warmth, feel how tight it's packed, listen to the paper on my skin, yearning for my lips to wrap around this beauty, ready ready ready to go. Smooth, fire-y, crackle, mmmmm, ahhh. OH!  I still have not figured out how to deal correctly with the following: feeling nervous, needing a break, feeling sad, feeling lonely, feeling bored, being at a bar, being at a party, being around people when I'm drunk, feeling like punching your boss, being at the end of my rope, driving alone - either really happily or really desperately, or what the hell is supposed to satisfy me after eating a meal? Pie sure isn't the answer.  For those of you that have never smoked, surely you must have a habit that you can equate to the ecstasy of a cigarette: jogging? eating tofu? tai bo? being Amish?  For those of you that currently smoke, I'm sorry. Pretend you never saw this post. Smoking is bad, cigarettes are bad, and you are bad for liking them.  And I love you and don't want you to die.  Stupidly, I thought this would help my craving go away. Now I  just want a cigarette ten times more. I'm going to 7-11 right now and by the time you read this it will be too late to stop me. Now, if only I had more than $5.00.  Maybe next time I get paid........
