      wow. Im in such an emo mood.I miss Caleb so much.And i miss people from school.I kinda cant wait to go back.But then again I can.But tomorrow i have a tryout for the limestone team.But im really only going just to get practice before i go to this one in pekin that i would really like to make the team for.Thats not until the 12 and 13 though so before then i have the cobras try out too which is pretty much another practice.So yeah i should be ready. I really wanna play for this pekin team. They play softball during the summer and winter. They have a dome they are building in pekin. Its gonna be soo rad.But they need 2 catchers and a shortstop.Ima catcher and aprile is a shortstop. How nifty is that!yay.ahh.I cant express how much i miss him.I will see him in three months.Which isnt far away but it is getting harder by the day.I'm just tired of him being so far away and a little young for me.bleh..im out.bye.

       So i had a good day today. My mom was sick and i cooked,cleaned,and did laundry. I felt pretty good about myself.I actually accomplished something.YAY!Anyway. The fam. came over tonight.It was fun. Havent seen them in a while.We might go to six flags with them.whoopty!Anyway.ok so im not playing for my original summer team so im gonna play for someone next summer. and i have been praying about which team i should play for and if im sure i want to give up all my time next year for it.Well my mom got a call&nbsp;from Aprile's(our shortstop)mom. She was telling my mom about some try outs that are gonna be going on because me and aprile are going to try to get on the same team. Well she tells my mom that there is gonna be a try out for washington cobras,peoria express, and pekin outlaws. i've heard of washing cobras and peoria express but i didnt know anything about pekin outlaws. well she told my mom that it is a new team they are starting up. and they need a shortstop and two catchers! how freakin rad is that! well anyway..they are also having an indoor winter league..and since i dont play basketball i can play there. so that means softball pretty much all year round except for volleyball season. which isnt bad but sometimes i do get bored with it. but i dont think i will because this is a very competitive league. so yeah its all good. but im gonna pray some more about it and make sure this is what God wants me to do. So im really excited and stuff. Anyway..So tonight my cousins are staying! YAY! its always fun when they are here..well not always but its always interesting! haha. Then tomorrow me and my cousin and my sister are going to san jose because my sister works there and so me and krystal can hang out with ashlee. She is my friend from there. and then my parents are picking Krystal up but im staying the night there. and its gonna be fun..so i will come back on saturday and then im going out with the girls! YAY!And then on sunday i have church. That should be fun maybe the bitch brittany wont be there. Gosh i dont care for her at all! She has been there for the past two sundays..damnit! Haha its on jason and her completely deserve eachother...bitch and prick..sounds good to me.haha..anyway.hum diddly dum. ok well im gonna go cuz i have nothing else to talk about.later.    &nbsp;

       wow. this weekend has almost been nausiating. I went bowling last night.I havent done that in forever.I went with my brother.Which that is always fun.He's a pretty cool guy.Despite he can be an ass sometimes.But i still love the kid!Well on the way home from the bowling alley.we got pulled over by a cop.Since we were both under age they were freakin out and they said the reason they pulled my brother over was because his license plate light was out.And im like well holy freakin hell do you wanna check for a body in the trunk or something. Yeah it was pretty gay. but w/e.So today i did nothing at all.But tonight i went to Juan's house. we watched movies. Remember the titans.and chicken run.haha.But i got to hang out w/ jess,matt,tyler,john,and my mom and dad.bleh.Im not sure if i like matt or not (different one).I mean he is cool at times. but other times i just wanna freakin casterate the kid.haha.no.we went out when we were younger and that didnt work to well.but im not sure if i wanna date him or w/e.but the word "dating" to me, does seem a bit overrated.oh well.Tomorrow i have church. I like church. Its mostly fun when brittany isnt there. stupid bimbo. I know im bad. I go to church and i cuss alot. Its bad.but when ya got kids in my youth group like i do.I'm prolly the most behaved out of all of them.but oh well.thats how life is for ya.well me at least.bleh.no matter how hard i try to get another boyfriend or move on its like i just cant let go of Caleb.or Daniel.Its like no matter what i do i know they will always be there.and i know they live very far away.but i see them both at least once a year. and i know that if i had a boyfriend at the time and they asked me if i would go out w/ them i would definently drop my boyfriend for them.Its weird.and complicated.well enough for now. later.

       yeah so today was fun. I went to&nbsp;church and that about it. I could have gone to matts with my brother but i decided not to..its still weird right now..im not sure what i want.and that blows. because i feel like im leading him on. and that is not my intentions at all..yeah anyway..softball is finally over! well we might have a game on the 27th against tremont. whoopty freakin doo. but matt S,john, jason, and my brother are going. so yeah itll be fun. We have our end of the year party at skippers house! thats always fun...Our season went by so fast. Its like it didnt even happen...but i still think last year was the best out of every summer. sigh. great fun. anyway..im really glad Goby and steph were on our team this year. they are the freakin shat! i love them kids to death! well anyway..im not sure what im gonna do for next summer..im seriously thinking about playing for bobby if he gets a team..which has its downfalls like gone every weekend..which isnt fair to my friends but if i want to play i think this is what i have to do...its not so much that i want recognition for playing..its just that if i want to go far with my softball career i need to put myself out there so they know who i am..and what i can do..but if he doesnt have a team im not sure what ill do i just want to have aprile there with me and stuff..which i know sounds dumb but its more of like a security/trust thing. so..i was thinking yesterday..i have been playing on the midwest spirit team for about...5 or 6 years..thats a long time..and the games yesterday that we played..could possibly be the last games i ever play for that team..in a way i kind of feel like a trader for it..because its been the same team and the same people for as long as i can remember and now that we are getting older some of us are going to different places...next year i think we are going to loose alot of our core players..but anyway..i just feel bad just leaving my team hanging there with out a catcher and such..so yeah..well enough about that..ima go. later

Sunday i went to church and thats about it.Yesterday i went to matts game.:) He pitched.He did very well.And then i went to his game again today.He played 3rd.He did ok.Not the greatest.But we all have our days. especially me.Hmm..Im so confused about that kid.Yeah he is pretty much the only excitment in my life right now besides some occasional calls about softball. I'm glad school is starting soon.Its gonna rock.Last year really sucked for me.I was depressed pretty much all year.And that was really bad.But this year..Im gonna make it the best.I'm glad we get the new freshman cuz i have alot of friends in their grade.Its gonna totally rock w/ jesse,tab,tyler,tiny,and all the other kids.especially jesse.she's the coolest.I donno its just weird.Its like i can be myself when im around all of them.This year i felt kinda lost cuz i didnt know how to act.Intimidation of older guys was a big problem for me.wow.JoshT.yumm..that kid is georgious!Anywho.its just gonna rock!ok well enough about that.So i get to see caleb in like less than 3 months..whoopty whoop. But i cant wait for halloween to come.cuz me and nat are dressing up like beavis and butthead.and then we are gonna hang out w/ my brother matt, and aprile.wahoo.Anyway.Ima go.later.:x

And i want it to go away. iwant my brother to be happy. i want to be happy. i want to date someone and not have to feel bad or guilty. i want to not miss him. i want to be with him. i never want to have to say goodbye again.goodbyes..i hate them. they are my worst enemy. I know God wont give me more than i can handle..but damnit im at the end of my rope. im at least glad im crying again. Its when im not that i worry myself. i feel drained. i want to find the end of my tears. Its like a blurr..nothing makes sense anymore. i cant comprehend what is going on around me. they say it will get easier..well when the hell is that supposed to happen..i deffinently do not see it...lift me up...show me the way.i dont know what to do anymore..i dont know what is right for me...im gonna go read my bible..thats the only thing that seems right for me right now. later

       So yeah i just got back from the pekin team tryout! Thats a big check in the NO column. So me and aprile decide that we were gonna play for the Washington Cobras. Which is cool cuz i like them. But i called brad and i told him i wasnt gonna play for him and he took it very well which i knew he would but i still felt bad. He said that it showed alot of character of me and aprile to call him back because alot of girls wouldnt call him back. And i told him that i had alot of respect for him and that he was a great coach and i felt that it was something i had to do and that he deserved that at the least. and hes like well thanks i really appreciate that. But yeah i have some doubts still but i really think this is where i want to play. So yeah. Well i was talking to tyler the other night and i explained to him what was holding me back about going out w/ matt. and i told him that i was scared of what aprile would say and then caleb. And i told him that if i didnt think there was anything there with me and caleb i would have givin up a long time ago because of distance and i see him very rarely. And he said to me..you know that you are only young once..and i just realized alot of stuff..but yeah im going to the movies w/ tyler, aprile, and matt tommorrow..so it should be fun.:) but i have to give all my thanks to God for letting me be on this team because he is the one who is allowing me to do so.well im kinda hungry i havent ate dinner and its 10 so ima go.later.      Each and everyday, it leads into tomorrow,and tomorrow brings one less day without you.But don't wait up, just leave the light on,'cause all the roads that I might take, will all one day lead back to you.-rise against

       I cant get passed this   Its my state of mind   A step towards the future   Is a cut from behind.   I've found myself here   face at your feet   venting my fears   giving in to defeat   To many times   I've tried to pretend   to look it passed   look to the end   the end isnt what i desire   i desire your passion   i desire your heart   i desired the times    when you gave me a part   I felt so close   never so wanted   wanting to love   and not look back   each person to see   and not what they lack   At times i see in your deep passionate eyes   and see who you are and how you feel   your eyes gave you away   you showed me your feelings   when you looked in my eyes that day   a day ill never forget   i sit and wait for you to come   and in the end i realize   i must wait   wait for your heart   wait for your love   wait for the cue from above   waiting isnt the hard part   being scared to move on is   i want to go on loving   but i cant love    like i love him.   i gave my heart to you so long ago   ill never want it back   you may do with it what you may   but never give it back   cling to it   its yours forever   It'll never be anothers   as long as i live   i will swear to you   ill hold on forever   and never let go   ill keep you in my pocket   so now you will know   it is yours keep it forever   ill never take it back   no not ever.   i love you.   forever.

      so i havent wrote in here for a while.So I've been to two softball tryouts. Limestone and Washington.Limestone said they wanted me if i wanted to be on their team.They also told aprile that too.Washington seemed interested in me and aprile both.But aprile and I are both still wanting to play for the pekin team.so on tuesday i have another one for Washington.That should be great fun.not.So im thinking aprile and my brother might hook back up.:) yay. that is way cool. cuz he is like in love w/ her. and i know when they broke up it was a mistake and they have never stopped liking eachother.Well her brother really likes me. and i like him alot too but im scared. Because i know i couldnt just forget about caleb if i went out with him.And this may sound bad but i would drop anyone for caleb anyday.I'm just kind of confused how anything is going to happen between me and caleb because he lives like 2 hours away and he hasnt told me that he likes me but everyone knows he does.I dont want to be scared to date other guys because of him but i dont want to miss a chance that i would have with him because i am dating other guys.confused.but its gonna be hard for me to actually commit. There is always that thing that tells me 'he's still there'.i donno.I dont like to get peoples hopes up and then only crush them down again. I hate hurting people.well ima go.later.
