      Who in their right mind would marry BS? She acts, looks, and just is...well...trampy. I'm sorry but it's true. Even though she knows kids watch and try to mimitate her, she still wears pretty much no clothes. And her latest videos have been pretty sick. All I know is if I had a kid, I wouldn't let him or her even have a BS CD! That's my point of view. Don't like it comment, please comment, I don't even have one measly comment!! But thanks for at least looking at my site!  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                    **Stef**

      YAHOO!! Its almost July 4th. So get out your American Flags, and wave them high and proud!! And u can't forget fireworks!!  P.S. THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON"T CELEBRATE THIS HOLIDAY ONLY: But for those who don't believe in these celebrations, just remember what we are celebrating, FREEDOM. If not for freedom you wouldn't have a choice in celebrating this. And you have a real problem if u think we praise the flag. It's not the flag we are honoring, it's the purpose and the reason for the flag. People died for Freedom. If you hate freedom, what America stands for, then just go live in Iraq, cuz they don't like freedom either. I don't say this just to be mean. I just am patriotic, and it really hurts that all these people have and are dying so that we could be free, and people make fun of the pledge, and make stupid claims like we praise the flag and stuff, and it makes me kind of upset. I hope this doesn't offend anyone.Really.  ~Peace n Love~  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                           **Stef**

      Well...The latest news on the twins is that MK Olsen has checked into a treatment center for an eating disorder. Sad, But totally believable. I mean she is so skinny, they both are, but Mk is way thinner. My favorite actresses have always been Mk and Ashley Olsen, and there were always so pretty, skinny, and popular. Why would one of them do that? Some questions are really hard to answer. People just need to realize that no matter what you can always get help before going to such lengths as an eating disorder. Talk 2 someone. Get help. It's that simple, or maybe not. But remember you can always talk and get help, no matter what. ~Peace n Love~ Adios  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                      **Stef**

      Well one of my favorite singers Hilary Duff is becoming more and more popular. And shes letting her sister Haylie Duff in on it too!! Their latest video, "Our Lips Are Sealed,"rocks. I think its so cool Hilary Duff let her sister be included, since Haylie was the one who actually wanted to be the famous siger, While Hilary kinda just fell into that role! And Hilarys newest movie, A Cinderella Story, with major HOTTIE Chad Michael Murray!! It premieres only in theatres on July 16. I can't wait!! So mark your Calendars!!

      Well guess what? 14 year old Teens may actually get to vote. Read this.   One small step for Berkeley teenager Robert Reynolds. One giant leap for teenage-kind. If the politically active Berkeley High junior gets what he wants, teens will soon be stepping up to the ballot box and casting votes just like responsible adults across the nation.

       "Aw, phooey!" Donald Duck is 70!   The cantankerous and often unlucky Disney legend feted his birthday at Disneyland Paris on Wednesday by dancing on stage under a shower of confetti as hundreds of park revelers sang "Happy Birthday To You."  A parade down the theme park's Main Street marked the occasion, with Mickey and Minnie Mouse leading the way. Daisy Duck and friends trailed behind carrying a giant pink cake bearing 70 candles.

      Today is a sad day for many. As many Americans attend President Ronald Reagans Funeral on the street Constitutional Avenue in Washington D.C. They are even thinking of putting him on the ten dollar bill. He was the most loved President, well except for Kennedy of course. There are at this moment doing a 22 gun salute. They should fill the air with sound and smoke in just a moment. Wow, Reagans casket weighs exactly 700 pounds. Rest in Peace our beloved President Ronald Reagan.                                         ~ President Ronald Reagan ~                            1911-2004 Pro-life rocks.

      Isn't it sad when you don't learn to really appreciate someone until it's too late. I always whined about my big brother Nick when he lived here. Now that he is in the ARMY and I never see him, I miss him so much. I mean i do get to go see him graduate next week  but after that its him gone for like eight months. Also, with my cat Garf. When I found out she was sick I couldn't stop crying and was with her every second i could. I loved her, but I wish, I had cared for her more when she was alive. Just remember to always tell the ones you love just how much you love them as often as you can. I know I will.  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                        **Stef**

      There are a lot of people who dislike the Military. It saddens me, that all those men died fighting so that we could be free, so that people can be different religions such as: Jehovah  Witnesses, or Christians. They died for freedom. My brother is in the ARMY, and it makes me sad thinking that he may go into War. But without War the United States wouldn't be that. We are what we are (free) because of War, the Revolutionary War. I am proud of this Country, and honored to have a brother in the United States Military. And I am really proud of all the men and women in this country who are brave enough to enter the Military. I may enter the Military when I turn eighteen, but that's just a thought, I'm not sure yet.  No matter what anyone thinks the ARMY, NAVY,and Marines are the greatest tools of this Country. Thank you to all the brave men and women. And to all the parents who lost someone in Iraq, I am very sorry. They were all very courageous.                      God Bless                    Pro-life rocks                    **stef**

      **I just read about this on Yahoo. I couldn't believe I have not heard this before. Jenn. Lopez married, and maybe even a baby?   **When news broke that JENNIFER LOPEZ wed singer MARC ANTHONY on Saturday, it was a surprise to everyone -- including the 40 friends and family members invited to the posh ceremony. Tonight on ET, we talk to US Weekly Editor-in-Chief JANICE MIN about how the superstars kept the wedding so secret and the possible reason they tied the knot so quickly!  **"There have been rumors about a baby on the way," she says. "Jennifer has made no secret that she'd love to have children. She's 34 years old, she's very family oriented, she loves her nieces, family is important to her and we know that Marc Anthony loves children too." She continues: "Whether or not she's pregnant right now, nobody knows, probably not. But I would definitely expect a little baby on the way soon."

      Top Videos: 05/31/2004     1.  Burn Usher   2.  Leave (Get Out) JoJo   3.  Everytime Britney Spears   4.  Yeah Usher   5.  Dip It Low Christina Milian   My opinion: I think Britney Spears is starting to make appropriate and cool music that you actually want to listen to. And I think JoJo might make it, but I don't know. Now Usher....I just love Usher,he is sooo hot, and a great singer, but mainly HOTTTT!!!!!! I have no idea who Christina Milian is though!! thats my view!!

Sorry I can't come. I love you Mom and Dad. Goodbye everyone, Stef.   Pro-life rocks!!  God Bless...Stef   5 Top Videos: as 04/19/2004   1. Everytime Britney Spears  2. My Band - Featuring Eminem D-12  3. Yeah Usher  4. Roses Outkast  5. Burn Usher   Hey, Stef here. I want to say hi to my friends!!     Well...A week ago at my school there was this Christian club started. I thought it was nice, since I am Christian. That same day, just because the religion group started, some person started an anti-religion group. That really made me mad. Now the anti people are trying to say that the Christian club should not be allowed, but that its ok that theres is allowed. Dumb. And to make things clear there is nothing wrong with saying "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance, and I will say it till the day I die. The religion club is not forcing anyone to go. Its for people to go if they so choose, something to do at lunch, nothing is wrong with that. But starting a club out of pure revenge of another club is just plain wrong. The religion club started theres for a reason. I wonder what the anti-religion clubs reason was.      Hey its finally Summer, and it rocks. No school 4 2 months. YAHOOOOOOOOOO!! Wanna say waz up 2 my friens. Stay cool. Happy Birthday Megan, I hope your party goes great. Sorry i can't come. I love you Mom and Dad. Goodbye everyone, Stef.  Pro-life rocks!!
