      Realisation #1: Drivers in Toronto suck!!!! I saw at least 3 accidents or near accidents on the 401 in the rain this weekend.  Realisation #2: Hydroplaning is scary as all hell! When I finally got back last night, almost on the island, my car decided to drift from the right hand lane into the left. Luckily, no one was in that lane anywhere near me. The cause; that collection of water in the turn. My fingerprints are now embedded in my steering wheel.  The zoo was cool. We saw a tiger stalk the donkey they were walking by the cage. He wanted meat. The Canadian domain is at the bottom of Mt. Everest, so my legs are still trying to recover from that walk.  My sister's graduation ceremony was long and boring, especially for a 4 year old. But the awarding of commisions the following day was pretty cool. They did the officer promenade and there were flybys by a couple of propeller planes and a pair of CF-18 Hornets. Also, they fired the Howitzers and rifles. To top things off, a pair of Canadian geese staged their own flyby, which was not planned at all.

      I need to get away from some of the stupid people I work with, like now. They complain that it's sunny and the next day complain that it's not. I needed to temp fix a problem and someone said, "No problem, I can hear what I need to hear anyway." This morning she says, "Hey, I can't hear anything, did you do something?" No shit, the thing I did we discussed on Friday. Remember, you were there.

      So now we swap out the NIC to see if we can resolve it this way. I just want this to be over.

      So last Thurday I'm in my car, driving to work and the two guys who work on this  urlLink Morning Show  decide to talk about the upcoming Friends finale. You know how it is, people spread the rumours and shit. They're almost never right. So they proceed to strip the plot bare, almost every possible detail aired live.  Thursday night, I'm watching Friends. For no reason, evidently, because the radio guys had been right. Everything they said happened. Wow, way to go, people. 10 years of watching and waiting down the drain (makes me sound fanatical, which I'm not, but I  was  pissed.  So what do I do? I write an email to the Assistant Program Director.   Hello,               I regret to say that I am writing to register a complaint about the Morning Show of Thursday May 6, 2004. At about 8:10am I was in my car listening to Aaron and Tassoâ€™s show. At this time, Aaron proceeded to reveal every single aspect of the upcoming Friends finale in detail. Having now watched the Friends finale I can say that he was 100% accurate, and in effect ruined the watching of the show. There were no surprises and no shocks in the show, making it one of the worst Friends viewing experiences I have ever had.              I do not understand why this was allowed to happen. After 10 years, I think that people had the right to not have spoilers pertaining to the series thrust into their faces without their approval. If I had wanted to have the plot ruined for me, I would have sought out one of the many spoiler sites available to me on the internet. I am very disappointed with the morning crew because of this, and I regret to say that I may feel more comfortable choosing another show for my drive to work.   Thank you for your attention.   Regards,    Now, I missed the on-air reading of this letter, but I'm told they basically said who cares and laughed at my email. Fair enough, I say.  But the Assistant Program Director couldn't be bothered to even respond. I didn't write to the hosts of the show, I wrote to a director. She could have at least acknowledged the email I wrote. I wonder if she responds to suppliers in the same way.

      So a LAN problem at work may finally be on the route to recovery after last night. We had to update the UNIX server BIOS and NIC drivers in the hopes that this will stop my LAN overload problem. I'll know more today. I was here until 8:30pm because of this and another, unrelated Windows server problem. At least I had company in the form of outside tech support.

      from the  urlLink Royal Military College of Canada  on Victoria Day weekend, so I'm heading up to Kingston with the family on the Friday. We may move on to Toronto for the rest of the weekend and go to the zoo. If the price of gas doesn't break me first.

      We'll see if it's worth it. I've never been good with a journal, so this will be quite a stretch.

      After a 21 hour service call, my Windows server is back, minus a day's worth of data. Turns out I had a corrupted backup for Friday and that's why I couldn't restore from it.

      I picked up the  urlLink HS810 Bluetooth Headset  for my new phone on Friday. It's cool so far, but I have 30 days to return it to Future Shop so I have some time to really test it. No wires is much better in the car.

      We took my daughter to pierce her ears on Sunday. After preparing her for the worst, she came through like a champ. She cried after the first shock hit, but when it was done and could see herself in the mirror, she felt much better. Now she's counting down the days until she can change them.

      I planned to spend some time on Saturday reparing my Windows 2000 server at work. Basically nothing worked as planned and I spent 12.5 hours trying to fix it. After more time on Sunday, I threw in the towel and called for the technician first thing Monday morning.  I'm tired.

      OK, I understand 7-10 business days, but it's always been 2 days tops when I order and receive my goods from the T.O. area. Where's my phone?!?!?!

      We installed managed switches to replace my 2 hubs yesterday, and so far (knock wood) things seem normal now. Now I just have to wait and see if the long term results are good.
