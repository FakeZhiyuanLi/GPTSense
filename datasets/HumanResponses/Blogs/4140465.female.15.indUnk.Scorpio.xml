      I missed a day because last night i got sick... August 12, 2004 -Bagel toasted w/ butter - then dinner which i had some bad shrimp and ended up throwing up ALL the other things i ate that night.. which is kind of a plus!  August 13, 2004 -3 slices of pizza -Cheese Balls -Chips and Dip - i ate a bunch of gum..so that i wasnt hungry....b/c my mom didnt want me to eat anything incase i had to throw up again -part of a piece of cake  GOAL! i dont know im in such a bad mood!!!! probably to go one day with only one meal and just drink a lot of water....

      Today was an ok day...even with the horseshow and the snack tent i didnt snack!!!  August 11, 2004 -Toasted Everything Bagel w/ Butter -Turkey and Swiss Wrap w/ Honey Mustard -Soup in the Cup w/ a Everything Bagel w/ Butter  Goal!!! My goal for tomorrow is try to narrow down the amount of food again....and keep the amount of excercise up!!! Today I rode my bike a mile and a half to the Hunt Club and then rode it around the Hunt Club all day which is a good source of excerise...But for tomorrow I am really going to try to keep it to 2 meals no snacking unless it is skittles...because those are just toooooooo good to pass up!! And I need to get some source of exercise...so maybe i will ride my bike to the Hunt Club or something....

      Today I had 3 meals...which was part of my goal but one of them was VERY unhealthy...i cant believe it...i got sooooo bred that i just binged!! DAMNIT!!!  -Bacon, Egg and Cheese on a plain hardroll -5 Mozzerella sticks w/ ketcup along with an Onion Ring....grrrr -Rack of ribs...i cant believe i ate them all!!! With a  salad on the side which had onions and carrots in it along with Cesar Dressing  Goal!! Well conisdering tomorrow is a horseshow and that means that i will be by the snack bar pretty often so fight temptations will be really hard...i am going to stick with my goals and try and eat less...hopefully i can get down to 2 meals..no snacking!!! if i do have lunch tomorrow it will be a turkey and swiss wrap with honey mustard sauce...NO FRIES,CHIPS OR ANY OTHER SIDE FOODS!!! and for  dinner i will eat as little as possible....and to avoid snacking i will just drink alot so every time i feel like snacking i  will just grab some kind of drink like lemonade or a coke or the healthiest thing a water!!!! Hopefully tomorrow will be a good day for my diet!!!! Well thats all I really have to say....hopefully this will happen...

      I AM DETERMINED TO LOSE WEIGHT!!!! So I am going to use a blog or whatever to help me keep track of what I eat so that I can improve my diet and lose like 20 pounds!! That is my goal! Every week I will weigh my self and I will make daily entries of things i have eaten that day....this way i can keep track..and I promise that I will not lie about anything...I will be honest and put EVERYTHING that i have eaten on that daily entry even if it is a lot of food and is embarassing...I will also put an entry below my daily intake and it will be called Goal! this will be where I put my goals for my daily intake for tomorrow!!! Hopefully this will help me lose weight!!!!!  Monday August 9, 2004 -Bowl of Life mixed with Crispix -2 hot dogs with cheese, ketcup and mustard -Apples with cheese -Macaroni and cheese -Salad with onions and thousand isle dressing -Mints -20 skittles -3 spoonfuls of fluff I cant believe i have eaten soooo much....AHHHHH!!!  GOAL!!!  OK!!!I AM CUTTING DOWN TO ATLEAST 3 MEALS A DAY WITHOUT SNACKING!!!! A meal consists of 2 or less items of food that are healthy!!!!! Tomorrow everything that I eat will be healthy no more chips and if i eat any candy it will be gum or skittles...THAT IS IT!! everything else is healthy wraps or salads...some red meat every once in a while!! I AM GOING TO TRY AND NEVER EAT FRENCH FRIES AGAIN!!! ITS AWFUL!!! AWFUL!!!! AWFUL!!!! OK so recap of goals... -3 meals...Meal: 2 or less items...NO GREASY FOODS -No more french fries -NO SNACKING!!! OK well hopefully this will work because seeing it on paper might make me realize how much i am actually eating and embarass me into not eating a lot all the time!!!

      THIS IS MY WEIGHT DIARY!!! It is going to help me get down to about 115 or 120 pounds which will help me look better on a horse...look better as a person and hopefully get my mom off my  back about being fat....right now i am at about 140 pounds give or take a few pounds and  i am not happy!! I am self concious all the time and i have never been kissed and i am convinced it is because of my appearance so i am going to fix that and lose as much weight as i can without becoming unhealthy!!!!  This is the purpose of this Journal and lets pray it works!!!!
