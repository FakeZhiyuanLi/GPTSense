       Longing for Unity   A friend recently reminded me of a humurous story that has a somber point. A man, as the story goes, was stranded all alone on a deserted island. This mound of sand, and a smattering of vegetation was his home for a number of years. One day, and to his astonished delight, he saw a ship on the horizon speeding in his direction. The crew spotted his signal, and sent a small boat to rescue him.  While ashore, the captain noticed three huts on the island. Curious, he asked the castaway why there were three huts. "The first," the man answered, " is my home. The second," the man continued, "is my church." Venturing a quess about the other hut, the captain asked, "So, is the third hut your office?" The man, with noticeable angst, responded,"No, That's where I used to go to church!"  Oh, for unity in the body.

       The Iron Bowl: It's More Than a Game   Having grown up in Pensacola, Florida, the Alabama/Auburn (or is it Auburn/Alabama?) rivalry wasn't that huge of an affair. Don't get me wrong. Though I haven't conducted a scientific survey, per capita, there probably are as many Alabama or Auburn fans in Pensacola as their are Florida or Florida State fans. However, since moving to the state of Alabama in 1992, I've taken great interest in, not only the game itself, but the entire "Iron Bowl" week.  I have realized that the Iron Bowl is more than an intra-state rivalry in which two teams are pitted against each other on the gridiron. It's much more significant than which team happens to win the atheletic contest.  Here in Birmingham, Alabama, the local news stations run segments about the game all week long. Fans from both sides are interviewed, telling their stories about past games, and sharing their particular traditions surrounding this annual event. Past games. Emotional endings. Tailgating. Travel....And fellowship.  My self-righteous side wonders why folks spend so much time, energy, and money on a football game, especially when our world is saturated with more important concerns. In precisely those judgmental moments, however, I am reminded again that the Iron Bowl is more than just a game. And, I think the church can learn from this cultural phenomenon.  The game itself is only one factor in the overall equation. To its complex configuation, you must include the evocative power of story. During the week of the iron bowl, fan after fan would tell stories of their experiences at these respective schools, and the particular games that they've witnessed. These shared experiences become woven into the fabric of who they are. Thus, they cannot help but speak with great emotion about this game--because it's more than a game.  Story is what brings thousands of cheering fans together each year. And, it is also story that keeps the fire burning through the months "until next year's game."   The Church needs to learn this lesson. We have been shaped by an over-arching story of God's love that has been experienced uniquely by each of God's people. When we attempt to reduce our identity to rules we keep, or steps we've taken, the power of the gospel is drastically diminished. The story of God is about the Holy One Who has pursued the unholy, redeemed them through Jesus, and empowered them to holiness through His resident Spirit. Each of us has a particular expression of that story to tell. May we be so bold as to tell our stories...especially as we enter the Christmas season.

      Postmodernism has become the buzz word among theologians and cultural historians. This critial/pessimistic paradigm (if it can be called that) has been gaining strength sense the 1960's. Unfortunately, only until recently have church leaders become slightly aware of this epistemic move, and just now are attempting to respond to it. If historical trends have any predictive ability, church leaders likely will chisel out a postmodern ecclesiology while the cultural stream will keep moving.   I don't know if postmodernity will become the dominant cultural paradigm, particularly sense it is a reaction against something, rather than a move toward something. What that ultimate something is has not yet been determined. This simply means that the church must continue to be "light on its feet" and respond as the body of Christ in any given cultural situation.  As culture continues to be in flux, it is important to, not only be aware of its trends, but develop a relevant ecclesiology to meet new demands. At this point, we do need to think seriously about a postmodern ecclesiology and what that means for churches who were born out of modernity.  A good resource to assist in this process is:  Ancient-Future Faith, Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern Word , by Robert Webber. The following is Webber's own words regarding the focus of his book:  "The fundamental concern of this book is to find points of contact between classical Christianity and postmodern thought. Classical Christianity was shaped in a pagan and relativistic society much like our own. Classical Christianity was not an accomodation to paganism but an alternative practice of life. Christians in a postmodern world will succeed, not by watering down the faith, but by being a countercultural community that invites people to be shaped by the story of Israel and Jesus."  I think you will find Webber's book a helpful voice for these confusing times. His points about Christus Victor, and the place of baptism and communion are especially good.

      LifeSong, the music ministry at CrossBridge, is in the process of recording its 3rd CD. Under the gifted leadership of Greg Miles, LifeSong has become an integral part of what God's doing at our church. With these releases, our prayer is that God will work outside our walls, touching countless hearts, many of whom we might never know. And, to Him be all the glory.  The title for the CD is "Worship: Here and Now." As suggested by the title, the songs generally are vertically postured, though there is the horizontal dimension of calling all seekers to worship. The prayer is that the CD will bring people into the presence of God...where there is mercy.

      Several weeks ago, my daughter Amber, my father, sister mother, and brother in law took a trip to the Grand Canyon. It was the first time I visited that famous landmark. The experience proved to be a very spiritual on for me. The following is one article of three that I wrote based upon that experience.   God and the Grand Canyon 1   I had seen pictures, heard stories, and read articles about it. I had even considered scholarly debates about its formation. Was it caused by tenacious uniformitarian forces over millions of years or did catastrophism play a large role in its formation? Being one of the Seven Wonders of the World, I knew Intellectually, that it was magnificent—truly a wonder to behold. But, I had never personally experienced it.  On my trip there, I tried to imagine the impact that the famous chasm would have on my psyche. How would I feel? What would I think? How would it affect me intellectually, emotionally, physically?  We left the Phoenix airport later than anticipated, causing us to reach the deep ditch after nightfall. Though the darkness of night shrouded the gaping crevice, I just had to stumble to its compelling edge. Even in the darkness, I could sense its vastness. It seemed as if the sky itself had been sucked into its gaping jaws. A strange sense of awe—if not fear—began to sweep over me. There, before me in the darkness, was what I had read about, heard about, dreamed about. Though I could not yet see it clearly, I knew I was in the presence of something overwhelming. “Wow,” was all I could form with my numb lips.  I became somewhat frustrated, longing to see the Grand Canyon in all its anticipated glory; all the brilliant hues of rock painted by the sun itself. As I groped along the path winding around the canyon’s South rim, I was reminded of the ultimate mystery of God. Paul said it well; “We don’t yet see things clearly. We’re squinting in a fog, peering through a mist. But it won’t be long before the weather clears and the sun shines bright! We’ll see it all then, see it all as clearly as God sees us, knowing him directly just as he knows us!” (1 Corinthians 13:12; The Message).  At that point, I nearly wept. Wept at the reality that I really do grope in relative spiritual darkness, not fully knowing the Father. But that’s not what really made the tears well up in my eyes. I was overcome with the reality that, typically speaking, I’m easily distracted from a deep longing to see His face. Pressures of all kinds capture my attention. Ministry. Family. Home repairs. Administrivia. How easily these legitimate concerns become the epicenter of my life, creating waves of frenetic responses over the landscape of my soul.  Maybe you know what I’m talking about. If so, I hope you will be compelled to at least stand at the edge of God. For even at His edge, though still shrouded by the fog of our finite minds, you cannot help but be awed by His vastness; His depth; His glory. And maybe while there, you will be compelled to plunge into His presence…and experience His grace.  Oh Lord, “we want to touch you, we want to see your face…we want to know you more!”

      Gordon Dalbey, a good friend and brother, has recently released the updated version to his classic Healing the Masculin Soul: How God Restores Men to Real Manhood. I highly recommend this book to all brothers.  As guys, we struggled with many issues, from sexual addictions to relating to our children and wives. Gordon traces out these particularly masculine issues, and points to the only true source of healing--the Father God. This book has become a resourse for me. Having two daughters and two sons, I find myself returning over and again to the wisdom packed in these pages.  To order the book, go to Gordon's website: abbafather.com

       Storming the Gates   In his highly acclaimed book,  What’s So Amazing About Grace , Philip Yancey argues that grace is the church’s single most important contribution to our broken world. One need not be a Christian, Yancey correctly contends, to do wonderful humanitarian acts, i.e., feed the hungry, build houses, heal the sick. There is one thing the world cannot effectively do—it cannot offer grace.  Building on this theme, Yancey offers what I believe to be a correct interpretation of the image Jesus used to describe the church’s destiny—“the gates of hell will not prevail against it” (Matt. 16:18). Rather than a metaphor of defense, this figure signals an offensive posture. “Christians,” says Yancey, “are storming the gates, and they will prevail. No matter how it looks at any given point in history, the gates guarding the powers of evil will not withstand an assault by grace.”  As we explore what it means to be a ministry-oriented church, keep at least three important points firmly fixed in mind.  First, all ministry belongs to, and is of, God; we are simply participants with Him. Unlike worldly humanitarianism, godly ministry is done in the name of Jesus, and by His power. Second, ours is not a struggle against physical forces. We are at war with the spiritual powers of evil that attempt to keep our world shrouded in darkness (Eph. 6:12).   Third, true ministry occurs within the vulnerable sphere of personal interaction. Jesus did not develop highly organized—and impersonal—“kingdom growth” programs to see how many people he could collect at a given location. No, Jesus simply “went about doing good.” He dared to touch lepers, grieve with those who mourned, and rejoiced with those who experienced God’s deliverance. No program will ever replace the power of a personal touch.  Each time we minister to people in the name of Jesus we apply a solid blow at the gates of hell. May the Church wield the weapon of God’s grace boldly as we reach out to our community.

       Financial Peace at Crossbridge   My wife, Carol, and I, along with about 20 other couples just completed Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University, a thirteen lesson series dealing with appropriate money management. It was hosted by two of our couples at CrossBridge whose personal experience and understanding added to the overall benefit of the class.  Ramsey argues compellingly--and passionately--for debt-free living. He further gives practical ways in which this can be achieved. I would recommend everyone availing themselves of this material as we all strive to become better managers of God's stuff.

       And a Child Shall Lead them   In our current climate of ubiquitous self-orientation, a refreshing story of selfless integrity has emerged. Nate Haasis, a 17 year old quaterback for Southeast High, a Springfield Ill. school, demonstrated true character when he had his Central State Eight conference career passing record wiped from the books.  Nate's team was losing to Cahokia High 36-20 with 22 seconds left. Not only was his team going to lose the game, he also was going to fall 29 yards short of the passing record.  Nate's coach stikes a deal with Cahokia's coach at midfield. When play resumes, the Southeast defenders allow Cahokia's running back to jog, unimpeded, into the endzone. Cahokia kicks off, giving Southeast the ball, and Nate the opportunity to get the 29 yards he needs for the record. With 8 seconds left, Nate completes at 5 yard pass to Jacque Robinson who runs without resistance the necessary yards to give Nate the record.  When Nate realized what happened, his conscience wouldn't allow him to keep the record. He wrote the conference president, asking him to remove the record from the books. "Out of respect for my teammates, and past and present football players of the Central State Eight," Nate wrote, "it is my hope that this pass is omitted from any conference record."  Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated concluded his article about this young man by stating:  "And if it bugs you that a kid this honest and this principled doesn't have a singe Division I offer yet, relax. The sooner he gives up football, the quicker we can get him to the place where we really need him--Washington, D.C."  Amen!

      The following is the last of three articles that were inspired by my trip to the Grand Canyon this past October.   God and the Grand Canyon 3   Surprisingly, I didn’t sleep very well that night. I guess I was just too exhausted, too sore from the long day’s journey. Just before daylight, my sore legs dragged my aching body to the nearby lodge for a cup of coffee. I got it to go. I was lured to the Canyon’s edge once again to see where I’d been the day before. The morning’s temperature was a chilly 30 degrees. As I made my way to the Canyon, I cradled the cup of coffee in both hands, enticing the rising steam to warm my chilled face.  The path winding around the rim toward various viewpoints largely was deserted. Except for an older couple and a jogger or two, no one was on the path. To my right, three mountain goats were grazing near the trail, inching their way towards me. You never have a camera when you need one!  Along the winding path, there were breathtaking vistas of the canyon, each one offering the observer a fresh perspective of the massive depression. As I continued my stroll, stopping periodically to take in the beauty of it all, I kept choking back tears. I prayed softly, praising God for His unfathomable power.  At one promontory, not protected by railing, was a stone structure near the canyon’s edge. Strategically placed stones created both a low bench and supports for a large flat stone. Apparently intended for group photo shots, this rock configuration became an altar for me. I knelt, and as I imagined the old Patriarchs did at the various altars they’d built, I blessed the name of God.   Before me, and below me, I saw the winding path that we walked the day before. On our journey, I thought I’d noticed all the beauty. But, in my determination to get in and out in one day, I overlooked so much. I kept saying to myself, I want to go back; I’ve just got to go back, next time to experience the place, not just to accomplish a human objective.  Then it struck me. Worship is an encounter with the living God that leads to transformation. How often have we been so pragmatically determined to “do worship,” that we fail to experience, to relish God’s power and grace? How often have we turned worship into take-home tips for controlling our lives and circumstances rather than exalting and deepening our relationship with the very God who is Lord of both our lives and circumstances? At my makeshift altar that morning, I pled guilty to these—and other—self-directed approaches to God.  The next time you gather with fellow believers, I pray you will experience worship here and now. I pray that you will be brought to a place where God is all in all, and there you’ve seen His beauty, experienced His grace. And, hopefully, you will find yourself being compelled to go back again and again for a fresh encounter with His holiness. For, in those compelling moments, we begin truly to sense that He is “all we want, and all we ever needed,” not only here and now but also there and forever.

       Down in the River to Pray   The subject of baptism tends to be a lightning rod for theological controversy. We fuss about the mode, meaning, and appropriate subjects for baptism. I've just received, and read the opening chapters of, a new book by John Mark Hicks and Greg Taylor titled:  Down in the River to Pray: Revisioning Baptism as God's Transforming Work.    What appears to be the overarching point of the book so far is to move beneath the technicalities of baptism to the trinitarian emport of this act. This is a refreshing glimpse into a church practice that has been sadly diminished by much rangling about it's technicalities.  If the opening chapters are indicative of the balance of the book, it is well worth the read. I know John Mark personally, which makes this book even more significant to me. Because of my first-hand knowledge of John's character and scholarship, I can recommend this book to you without qualification. I'm looking forward to "going down to the river to pray" in order to refresh--and rethink--my understanding of baptism. I hope you will as well.  .

      Here is the second article that was inspired by my experience at the Grand Canyon in October of this year.   God and the Grand Canyon 2   I typically dread the sickening sound of an alarm clock jarring me to consciousness. Not this day. In fact, I welcomed, even anticipated, its annoying beeping. For, this day, I was going to do something I had never done—we were hiking from the South rim of the Grand Canyon to the Colorado River and back. The prospect of such a trek was itself challenging, but we were doing it in one day!  As we approached the trailhead at 6:00 a.m., darkness still largely shrouded the canyon. After a prayer for safety, we began our decent into the monstrous hole. As we walked, the sun’s rays began to tease to light the brilliant colors of the various strata created by forces not fully known. I finally began to see all the astonishing contours of this breath-taking place.  It seemed that at every new plateau, cliff, and crevice something new, more fascinating was revealed. The stroll through Indian Garden, where we broke for a quick snack of payday candy bars, canned beans, and fruit cocktail was an oasis in an otherwise barren land. After several long drinks of water we were back on the trail. More miles of endless twisting and turning as we slowly made our way to the winding Colorado. Our haggard group, consisting of my oldest daughter, sister, Dad, and me, wondered if we’d ever reach the river with the sickening realization that every step we took down we’d have to repeat on the way out.  We made it to the river that day, where we soaked our tired feet in the chilly Colorado. We also dragged ourselves out of the Canyon nearly 12 hours after we began. We did what signs and rangers warn you not to do—we hiked to the river and back in one day. That was a great feeling!  Later, as I reflected on the day’s grueling—yet fascinating—journey, several thoughts came to mind. First, I relished the personal experience that I had with something so much larger than myself that I will never be the same. Second, what really made the experience special is that I shared it with others whom I love. Because of our collective journey, each with our own unique reactions to it, we share an experience that binds our hearts together. I further felt strangely connected to generations past who marked and traveled the very trail we trod.  Nothing can take the place of a personal experience with the Father God. Only until we individually plunge into His presence will we ever begin to understand His beauty, His richness, His grace. Yet, at the same time, there is power in shared experiences. Others who similarly have traveled into the presence of God, with their own, unique response, are forever bound together by such shared experience. Such was the longing of the downcast Psalmist who reminisced about the times he “used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God” (Psalm 42:5).  As we worship, not only are our hearts touched by the Father and drawn into closer rhythm with His, but they also are synchronized with others who share the experience. Such is the power of God’s community—a group of travelers twisting and turning along a path traveled by many before, and powerfully connected by the experience. So, come, now is the time to worship!

       Extreme Makeover   You’ve probably seen some of those “before” and “after” pictures of people who, through the magic of modern cosmetology, are transformed from antiquated “plain Joe’s” to GQ potential. One of the current popular reality shows is  Extreme Makeovers    in which people deemed to be deserving are treated to plastic surgery, the latest cosmetics, wardrobes and spas, to transition them from "undesirable" to "irresistable."   While this show deals in the extremes, it does signal what's happening in more moderate scales in the broader culture. To boost self-esteem or to create a new persona for themselves, literally millions are spent on makeovers annually. While some attempt a physical renovation through the latest cosmetological techniques, others attempt a more profound—though equally self-induced—reconstruction.  In his book,  Reaching for the Invisible God , Philip Yancey confesses his own self-deconstruction and subsequent reconstruction whose outcome was ultimately unsatisfying. Embarrassed by TV programs like the “Beverly Hillbillies” and “HeeHaw,” Yancey attempted to disassociate himself from his Southern heritage. Vowel by vowel he worked to change his accent, succeeding so well that people react with surprise when they learn of his Deep South roots. Having read great books to remove all provincial blinders, Yancey felt that he had finally addressed—and conquered—his previous self, creating a “new man.”  Through more spiritually mature lenses, Yancey began to realize the limits to a self-constructed personality. Yancey writes: “In most ways important to God, I had failed miserably. I was selfish, joyless, and lacked compassion. With the notable exception of self-control, I lacked all nine of the fruits of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5.”  Yancey not only recognized the limits to a self-directed makeover, he ultimately came to understand that his entire project of reconstructing his personality had been misguided. “God did not want to work with a wholly different personality. God chose me.”  The strong urge to be someone other than who we are actually opposes God’s purposes for our lives. Often these feelings arise from a legitimate dislike of our sinful natures. It is precisely here, however, that the gospel offers good news. God, through the working of His Spirit, is not turning us into a wholly different person. On the contrary, through the redemptive work of Christ within us, God liberates—not destroys—our true selves! In this regard, Yancey concludes; “The Holy Sprit coaxes each of us to be ourselves, flawed personalities in whom God himself has chosen to dwell. With infinite resources, God can assist every willing person on earth in that custom process. It begins with trust in God’s best for me, a confidence that God will liberate my true self, not bind it.” Create room in your heart for God, and let God show you who you truly are. You might be surprised at such an extreme--and divine--makeover!

       Give Us Eyes To See   This old Hassidic tale summarizes much of what the world—and our churches—need so desperately today. The Rabbi asks his students, “How can we determine the hour of dawn, when the night ends and the day begins?” One student suggests, “When, from a distance, you can distinguish between a dog and a sheep?”  “No,” the Rabbi answers.  “Is it when you can distinguish between a fig tree and a grapevine?” asks a second student.  “No,” the Rabbi says.  “Please tell us the answer, then,” say the perplexed students.  “It is,” says the wise teacher, ”when you have enough light to look human beings in the face and recognize them as your brothers and sisters. Until then the darkness is still with us.”  If you think about it, this rabbinical saying is packed with insight into the human condition. Typically, how we see or perceive a situation or individual determines how we feel. Our feelings in turn heavily influence how we respond. In the end, if our vision is blurred by prejudices or self interests, our reaction to others will be influenced accordingly.  Jesus had eyes focused by divine lenses. This resulted, not in a pious attempt to insulate his holiness from sin, but a tender compassion to counter their sin with his holiness. Where some saw sinners to be avoided, Jesus saw potential sons of God. Where some saw the need to shun disease, Jesus saw the opportunity to show deliverance. Where some saw trouble, Jesus saw triumph. Where most saw death, Jesus gave life.  As Jesus engaged his broken world so we are to engage ours. Faces and times have changed, but the need remains the same. May God remove the darkness and grant us eyes to recognize all humans beings as his special creation in desperate need of God’s love.

       Be Still...And Let God Work: A New Year’s Resolution   With his keen ability to find humor in the most unexpected things, Gary Larson made us laugh, caused us to blush and, perhaps more often than we’d like to admit, left us puzzled over the esoteric meaning of his satirical Far Side cartoons. Whether or not Larson intended them, I have on occasions found profound spiritual meaning from the Far Side. Consider this one, for example.  The picture is of the western “badlands.” The sun is high in a cloudless sky. The scorched landscape consists of bare, rugged cliffs and barren, sandy hills. The only plant life in the picture is a lone Sequoia cactus standing tall in the foreground. Somehow avoiding the immense open space, a bumbling cowboy has managed to guide his horse head first into the cactus. Expressing the thoughts of the irritated horse, the caption reads, “That does it...I’m gonna steer.”  Have you ever felt like this horse when it comes to your spiritual journey? Have you ever wondered where God is taking you? Have you ever thought that perhaps you could do a better job of directing your own steps rather than giving the reins of your life to God? Be honest now.  In our limited thinking, it seems that God occasionally runs us smack into painful cactuses, tempting us to snatch the reins from His omniscient hands. Job changes. Financial loss. Sickness. Death. During such trying times, it’s human nature to think, “Surely God could have guided us around these painful obstacles.” If you are facing such difficulties hear God’s Word before you attempt to retake control of your life, “Consider it a sheer gift, friends, when tests and challenges come at you from all sides. You know that under pressure, your faith-life is forced into the open and shows its true colors. So don’t try to get out of anything prematurely. Let it do its work so you become mature and well-developed, not deficient in any way” (James 1:2-4; The Message).  Have you run into any cactuses of life lately? Before you direct yourself into the "obviously-open" countryside, maybe you should think seriously before you act. It just might be that God actually has brought you to the only source of available water to moisten your parched faith. Be still...and let God do His marvelous, faith-building work. Now that’s a New Year’s resolution to seriously consider!

       The Continuing Privilege of Christmas   In his introduction to  The Message , a popular translation of the New Testament, Eugene Peterson made the following observation.   The arrival of Jesus signaled the beginning of a new era. God entered history in a personal way, and made it unmistakably clear that he is on our side, doing everything possible to save us. It was all presented and worked out in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. It was, and is, hard to believe—seemingly too good to be true.  But one by one, men and women did believe it, believed Jesus was God alive among them and for them. Soon they would realize that he also lived in them. To their great surprise they found themselves living in a world where God called all the shots—had the first word on everything; had the last word on everything. That meant that everything, quite literally every thing, had to be re-centered, re-imagined, and re-thought.   If you are anything like me, I typically experience the post-Christmas “blahs.” Maybe its my system drying out from the abnormal amount of sweets, turkey, and other rich foods I consume during this time of year. Perhaps it’s simply the emotional adjustment of coming down from all the excitement—even stress—of the holidays.  At this early post-Christmas time, I need to hear these words from Peterson. They remind me that Christmas isn’t a punctuated event in history. Rather, it’s a continuing reality that we all have the privilege to experience. God has taken up residence among us in a personal, powerful way. And, as Peterson states, it literally means that “everything [has] to be re-centered, re-imagined, and re-thought.” May God grant us the grace to “renew our minds” as we set out to determine His perfect will for our lives. Such is the continuing privilege of Christmas!

       The Passion of the Christ   I just returned from experiencing the Passion of the Christ, the film by Mel Gibson. This is much more than a film. Typical movies are about the susension of disbelief. The only disbelief to suspend in this film is the extent to which Jesus loved--and suffered--for (and because of) all of us--Jew and Gentile. The movie makes the point, in excruciating detail, how far God's love compelled Him on our behalf; something that's just hard to believe...but so true!  If you're anything like me, I nearly run out of the theater after most movies--trying to get ahead of the crowd to the bathroom. This was eerily different. It was as if an invisible hand held the audience in their seats after the movie was over. No one moved. Sniffles and sobs could be heard throughout the audience. I was literally numb.  I was just faced with the sickening reality that Jesus clung to His cross because of my sin. This film wasn't about blaming any one group of people for the death of Jesus. The blame was placed squarely on the shoulders of all humanity, since Jesus took the stripes for, and experienced the ignobility of, death for each of us. It blamed us all.  But the film ultimately wasn't about blame. It was about divine love. It was about forgiveness. It was about the worth that God places on all us fallen humans--Jew and Gentile. It was about the God of the universe facing Satan as a vulerable human being and embracing all that it meant to be human. He refused not to die. He refused to die before His passion was completely experienced.  As I write these words with my cheeks still stinging from the tears that flowed down my cheeks, I couldn't help but think about my Christian life. How I'm often more concerned about my creature comforts than carrying a cross. Forgive me Jesus! It further placed all the current wrangling over how to do church in proper perspective. It's time for God's people to hit their knees before the crucified One. There, in all it's tragic glory, will we learn what it truly means to be a community of the cross.  The film is brutal. It's graphic. From my studies, it's all too consistent with the Roman form of flogging and subsequent crucifixion. I know that, from this point forward, the words "And they crucified him there," will take on new meaning.  I don't know how to recommend this movie. Not sure where the age cut-off should be. But, I think it's a film that needs to be experienced...especially in these times.

      Anci ent Future Worship   In the January/February issue of Worship Leader, Robert Webber, well-known for his work in thinking about worship in our postmodern culture, described his experience at Mars Hill Bible Church, a megachurch that engages in "Ancient-Future worship." The following is what Webber considers to be the difference between an ancient-future service and a Boomer contemporary service.   "First, it was not a Boomer seeker service. That kind of service is designed not to confront people with truth. The idea is to interest them in faith so they will come back for more or ask questions of friends who are Christian. The new generation has abandoned the "seeker notion." Yes, seekers are there in worship. But instead of hearing "tid-bits" of the Christian faith, they hear the whole thing.  "Consequently, the truth of God's work in Jesus Christ to rescue the world was proclaimed in word, enacted in the Eucharist and sung in the great hymns of the church. The old way was to make worship a show to watch; the new generation way is to immerse the congregation in truth through participation.  "The singing was noticeably different. No choruses sung again and again in endless repetition. Instead, hymns of great depth were sung with deep emotion as people moved forward (no plates sent passively around) to take bread and wine and receive Jesus.  "These changes sound simple, but they are profound. Mars Hill, like many others churches pastored by a new generation of leaders, are paving the way for the recovery of the old! Where are you headed?   As many churches struggle to become "contemporary," being driven by "seekers," I wonder if we aren't simply rushing to join the sidelines with other churches? Are we at a point where we need to rethink completely our worship paradigm? Is it time to actually trust that if we bodly "lift up Jesus," God will draw all people to him? Yes...where are we headed?

       The Music Won't Last   As we struggle with the fast-pace of our over scheduled lives, perhaps we all need to re-think our priorities. The following poem Titled Slow Dance (author unknown), powerfully demonstrates how our frenetic life styles can distract us from the true joys of life.  Have you ever watched kids on a merry-go-round Or listened to the rain slapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? You better slow down – Don’t dance so fast Time is short – The music won’t last  Do you run through each day on the fly When you ask “How are you?” do you hear the reply? When the day is done, do you lie in bed With the next hundred chores running through your head? You better slow down – Don’t dance so fast Time is short – The music won’t last  Ever told your child, “We’ll do it tomorrow” And in your haste, not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die ‘Cause you never had time to call and say “Hi?” You better slow down – Don’t dance so fast Time is short – The music won’t last  When you run so fast to get somewhere You miss half the fun of getting there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift… Thrown away… Life is not a race. Do take it slower. Hear the music, Before the song is over.  As the last stanza of this poem suggests, we all likely have plenty of gifts left unopened. This afternoon, why not take the time to open a few. Toss a ball. Shoots some baskets. Have a pretend tea party. Take a walk. If none of these things can fit into our hectic schedules, maybe we need to slow down, hear the music...before the song is over!

       Worship Here And Now   Last evening, February 15, LifeSong, the music ministry at CrossBridge, debuted its third CD. While the evening celebrated the culmination of months of work, its ultimate purpose was to usher people into the presence of God. And, that's exactly what occurred.  Under the gifted leadership of Greg Miles, all of the LifeSong singers, in choir fashion, lead us in moving worship. One of the most moving moments occurred when our children participated in the song, "Here I Am To Worship." There's nothing like witnessing the innocent hearts of children singing praises to their Creator! Thanks to LifeSong for such a wonderful evening in the Lord.  If you are interested in purchasing a CD, you can find out more information at our website: crossbridgechurch.org. While there, you can hear samples from this great CD.  To God be all the glory.

      My day’s schedule was all arranged. My wife, kids and I were taking a trip to North Carolina to visit a good friend in the hosptial. Before I could make the trip, I had several deadlines, and a few appointments to meet. Since our older two kids had to be at the office at 6:00 a.m. Thursday to leave on the youth trip to Six Flags, I took that as an opportunity to get an early start on my day.  While driving to the office, I sipped coffee from my special travel mug and mentally organized the tasks I would perform. Becoming increasingly pleased with my plans, I felt confident that reality would completely correspond to my mental images. But, when I got to the office, our Youth Minister gave me the sickening news—our power was off. It appeared that all other offices had power but ours. After I did my own electrical investigation, and found no apparent problem, I made the call to Alabama Power.  “Now what should I do,” I wondered. With no computer, no lights, and too early to make any calls, I was stuck. I admit, I was becoming annoyed and mentally agitated. Needless to say, my enthusiasm for the day plummeted. Since our reception area had a wall of windows, enough natural light spilled into the room to allow for some reading. So, in the dimly lit room, I opened my bible to James and began reading.  It was hard to keep mentally engaged as I constantly glanced through the windows, praying to see an Alabama Power vehicle drive up. As my eyes flashed from the text to the parking lot and back, the verse arrested my attention: “Now listen, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.’ Why, you don’t even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, ‘If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that’” (4:13-15).  I literally laughed out loud at myself. I had planned out the day very well, but I had no power (literally) to carry them out. I was reminded of several things. First, we really have very little control over our circumstances. Second, our very lives—and plans—are in God’s care, not ours. Third, when our beautifully-crafted plans fail, that puts us, maybe even forces us, into the position of self-examination. Finally, and upon such self-examination, our sense of self-importance is put into proper perspective when we realize that our lives are like a “wisp of fog, catching a brief bit of sun before disappearing” (The Message). The next time you experience a power outage, think about the meaning—and true Source—of your life.

       The Servant: A Simple Story About the True Essence of Leadership   I just completed reading a book whose title appears at the head of this blog. Written in conversational tone, this book offers compelling insights about effective leadership. Unlike typical treatises on managment philosophy, this books shoots right at the heart of the leader. In short, James Hunter, author of the book, presents a servant leadership model that calls for deep commitment, and sacrifice on the part of the one who dares to lead.  I recommend this book to anyone who is in a position of leader. Particularly, I think leaders in the church will be blessed--and challenged--by its content. In a time when positional power no longer carries the day, we are searching for relational authority in which we can influence people to accomplish the call of God in their lives. This book speaks to that point.

       Tangle With A Treadmill   Treadmill. For me, the word itself sounds uninviting at best, torturous a worst. Someone with a sadistic streak must have invented this miserable device. No matter how long you walk or run, you never go anywhere. And, you never really can win when doing battle with a treadmill. It has too many speeds and can outlast the Energizer bunny!  Sometimes treadmills can be just plain dangerous. I was with a close friend several years ago when he tangled with a treadmill that left both his body and ego badly bruised. We were in an exercise room, not for a serious workout, but just to kill some time. This facility had state-of-the-art weight machines, bicycles and, you guessed it, treadmills. Just for fun, he jumped on a treadmill to give it a whirl.  His treadmill of choice was extremely high-tech. It had a heart monitor, distance meter, speedometer, and kept a running total of how many calories you burned. In addition to these electronic gadgets, this treadmill had inclining capabilities. My friend got a kick out of seeing how steep of an incline he could negotiate. He did pretty well, I might add.  After returning to normal elevation, he did something pretty stupid—he attempted to walk backwards on the treadmill. What happened next was unbelievable. Because he could not keep pace with the treadmill’s speed, my unsuspecting friend shot off the treadmill with such a sudden stop that he sat down on the moving belt. As if an invisible hand grabbed the seat of his pants, the treadmill flipped him onto his back and hurled him across the tiled floor. He landed with feet in the air against a nearby rowing machine! I still get a chuckle when I think about my friend’s stunned look as he picked himself off the floor.  That humorous story, however, can have a somber application. If we approach Christianity from the perspective of performance-based acceptance, our religion can become like a merciless treadmill. When we think that everything depends on us—even our salvation—we fall onto a treadmill that inevitably leaves us on our backs and badly bruised. In contrast, God reminds: “The people who trust the Lord will become strong again. They will rise up as an eagle in the sky; they will run and not need rest; they will walk and not become tired” (Isa. 40:31; NCV). Now that’s good news for weary souls!

       Out of Gas?   A number of years ago, a beautiful float in the Tournament of Roses parade suddenly sputtered and quit. Frantic technicians scurried about to see what was wrong. No one could be sure. It appeared that all mechanisms where properly connected, and there was no perceptible reason why the motorized cart should not move the float. It was a mystery...until. Until someone asked the obvious; “Is the float out of gas?”  To everyone’s chagrin, it was. The whole parade came to a grinding halt while someone fetched a can of gas. What makes this story even more ironic—and embarrassing—is that the float was sponsored by the Standard Oil Company. With this company’s vast oil resources, it’s little truck ran out of gas!  While I try to be careful in drawing out spiritual analogies to such stories, I can see some applications to our Christian journey here. Let me suggest two. First, as children of the sovereign King of the universe, there are vast—infinitely vast—resources at our disposal. Too often, we allow our own human limitations to dictate our responses to any given crisis. And, we are limited, weak, and broken. Paul reminds us however, that God’s “power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Cor. 12:8).  Second, and I think this is Paul’s point, we must learn to rely on—tap into, if you will—the power of God rather than our own perceived abilities. Only then, can we experience Paul’s conclusion, “For when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Cor. 12:10). Through any hardship and trial, God’s grace is sufficient for us. If we don’t learn to make ourselves open to it, however, we, like Standard Oil Company’s float, will simply run out of gas.

       Living On Purpose   In one of his Far Side cartoons, Gary Larson depicts a chalkboard, two thirds of which is filled with a long, complex mathematical equation complete with Greek letters, plenty of parentheses, and a healthy number of brackets. The sum total of this contorted symbolic expression is a big fat “zero.” Two middle-aged, “nerdish” scientists are looking at their joint effort with stoic satisfaction. The one to whom the caption implicitly is attributed stands with his hands on his hips. The caption reads: “No doubt about it, Ellington—we’ve mathematically expressed the purpose of the universe. God, how I love the thrill of scientific discovery.”  In Larson’s own unique way, he was able to capture visually the contradiction between arrogant rationalism and the primal recognition—and need—we all have of something (someone) that is larger than ourselves. While the scientists gloated over their nihilistic theory expressed mathematically, God was just as easily—and enthusiastically—evoked and, ironically, praised for the accomplishment.  As I reflected on this cartoon, God put on my heart the words of Isaiah: “Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made” (Isaiah 43:7). Our human rationality is good, for it also comes from God. It becomes bad when Satan twists it for his own evil purposes. There are many in our world who, like the fictional scientists in Larson’s cartoon, believe that there is no ultimate purpose to the universe and, therefore, to their own lives. From this perspective, we are nothing but a fortuitous combination of molecules in a world of evolutionary confusion. Such a thought inevitably leaves us empty, longing for something else.  As humans, we bear the imprint of God in our souls. We have been created in his image. Despite the loud voices of radical rationalism, we intuitively sense that God exists and, somehow, engages us. And, as Isaiah reminds us, our ultimate purpose for living is to glorify God with soul, body, and mind. May we never forget who we are...and WHOSE we are!!

       Humilty and Self-Love: Mutually Exclusive or Mutually Essential?   I don’t know whom they were talking about, but it was obvious that he was in deep trouble. Apparently, this guy had been a real “jerk” to one of them, and these teenage girls wanted his head on a platter.  I observed this scene while at a mall in Georgia where I used to live. They were huddled together, hands on hips, making those head and eye gestures that teenage girls do so effectively. Taken together, their body language said, “He’s disgusting, and we’re going to make his life miserable!”  As I walked past this angry gathering, I overheard one of them say above the din, “Yeah, he’s in love alright...in love with himself!” “Whoa,” I said to myself as I strode down the mall, “He really must be a jerk.” Like those irked teenagers, I agreed all-too-quickly that loving self is intrinsically narcissistic and, quite frankly, disgusting.  To buttress my conclusion, I quickly called to mind several biblical passages that place a premium on humility, and warns against thinking too highly of oneself (cf. Lk. 18:10-14; 1 Pet. 5:6). Yet, as I was mentally dismantling this obviously-insensitive guy, another passage nudged its way into my thinking. “Love the Lord your God... and your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:39).  “Love your neighbor as yourself?” Doesn’t that statement imply that we should love ourselves? In fact, doesn’t it imply that without a healthy love for self we cannot adequately love others. It appears, then, that the Bible makes two, mutually-exclusive demands of us: (1) humility; and (2) self-love. How do we reconcile the two?  In response to this apparent dilemma, C.S. Lewis wrote in the Screwtape Letters: “[God] wants to kill [humans’] animal self-love as soon as possible; but it is His long-term policy...to restore to them a new kind of self-love—a charity and gratitude for all selves, including their own.” I think Lewis was right. In the biblical sense, love for self does not suggest a self-centered arrogance. Nor does humility demand a self-deprecating, devaluing of our own self worth.  Taken in tandem, these two biblical principles bring our view of self into proper focus. An humble, self love means we will delight in our own accomplishments—and those of others—as the marvelous work of God in our, and their, lives. As the Holy Spirit develops these biblical traits within us, we truly will “love our neighbors...as ourselves!”

       Don't Waddle When You Can Fly   Soren Kierkegaard, a prominent theologian of the 20th Century, tells a parable of a community of ducks waddling off to duck church to hear the duck preacher.  The duck preacher was in rare form as he quacked eloquently—and compellingly—of how God had given the ducks wings with which to fly. “With our amazing wings,” the duck preacher quacked with conviction, “there is nowhere we ducks could not go; there is no God-given task we ducks could not accomplish.” With the rhetorical skill of a master orator, the duck preacher ended on a high note, “With our powerful wings, we can soar into the very presence of God Himself.”  The duck congregation was caught up in the preacher’s words. Shouts of “Amen, brother, Amen!” were quacked throughout the duck assembly as they contemplated the possibilities that existed for their web-footed species.  At the end of this most moving service, the ducks left, quacking about what a wonderful, inspiring message they had heard...  and waddled all the way back home.   This humorous story packs a powerful punch, doesn’t it? God’s word is replete with messages about the possibilities that exist for His people. Hear just a few...  “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26)  “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13)  “Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us” (Ephesians 3:20)  Wow! What possibilities! God says we can soar. There is no God-given task that we could not accomplish. Now the question is: Are we going to settle for waddling, when we have the power to fly?

       There's Got to be a Lesson in This Somewhere    LONDON — A puppy that swallowed a kitchen knife nearly the length of his body is back to his playful self after an operation to remove it.  The baffled owners of 12-week-old Jake took him to the vet when they noticed him vomiting and trying to keep his body in a straight line.   X-rays revealed why the puppy was so reluctant to curl up: A kitchen knife was running through his body, with the plastic handle at the base of his pelvis and the blunted metal point at the top of his throat.   "Dogs are always swallowing strange things, from kebab sticks to corn-on-the-cobs to tape cassettes, but this was particularly unusual because it was such a large knife in a small puppy. It really did run the length of his body," said vet Christina Symonds on Wednesday.   The owner, John Mallett, 22, said he knew something was wrong but had no idea the Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross had swallowed the knife. "He would put his feet on you and put his head back, trying to keep his body in a straight line," said Mallett.   Jake was back on his feet less than 24 hours after the operation on March 30. "He's totally back to his old self," said Mallet.   This has to be up there with Jesus' parabolic rebuke to those who strain at gnats and swallow camels!

       Vengeance: Human and Divine   It's now been nearly seven years ago that  Judge Hiller B. Zobel made a decision that sparked both anger and relief.  On October 30, 1997, Louise Woodward was convicted by a jury of second degree murder in the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. Arguing that it was time to bring a “compassionate conclusion” to the British au pair murder trial, Zobel reduced Woodward’s murder conviction to man-slaughter and set her free.  I don’t know all the sordid details of this tragic affair. But, there remains one haunting fact that will not be ignored: an 8-month-old, helpless child was killed.  I still think of the parents of that baby. Empty arms. Long nights. Strained relations. It’s situations like this one that make Jesus’ command to “love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you” even more poignant (Matthew 5:44).  This case, and others like it, create in my heart a gnawing ache for justice. And, I know I’m not alone. To use a biblical word, humans intrinsically have a yearning for “vengeance.” While polite society outwardly recoils at these thoughts, all moral beings have a sense of justice.  And, this desire for vengeance is a biblically legitimate one. Certain psalms, for example, throb with an intense desire for retaliatory justice (cf. Psalm 109: 1-19). The Bible, therefore, validates our human longing for vengeance. Yet, on the other hand, it reminds us that vengeance is the sole privilege of God, “Vengeance is mine, says the Lord, I will repay” (Hebrews 10:25; Psalm 135:14).  As we struggle with our desires for vengeance, we need to be reminded of several biblical truths. (1) God is not indifferent in a moral Universe. He does take notice of, and responds to, human acts of injustice. (2) Since vengeance belongs to God, it is not personal, human business. (3) As were the psalmists, we are invited to express freely our indignant feelings for vengeance to God.  When we keep these truths close to our hearts, we will be in a better position to live a vengeance-free ethic, and choose to love those on the other side of justice as Jesus commanded—even the Louise Woodward’s of our fallen world.

       Easter and the  Christus Victor    As I write these words, our military continues to struggle Iraq. Over a year ago, we were given a near front row seat of coalition operations by means of news personnel embedded within military divisions. If you are anything like me, it was hard not to be glued to the TV or radio, listening for any new developments that might signal a quick and decisive end to the conflict.  While the initiall  blitzkreig   into Baghdad is over, our troups remain in harm's way. Although, the victory over Saddam Hussein's regime was decisive, there is much more dangerous work to accomplish. Nearly each day we hear news of yet another American troup killed in conflict. How is it that, though a decisive victory was won, fighting--and casualities--continue?  This current situation brings home an often overlooked scriptural dimension to Easter: Jesus’ resurrection won a victory over the powers of evil (the  Christus Victor —the victory of Christ). As we typically associate Easter with niceties such as egg hunts, bonnets, and new outfits, perhaps we need to be reminded that the work of Jesus had to do with “binding the powers, dethroning the powers, and assuring his disciples and followers that the powers will be utterly destroyed and routed out of the world at the end of history” (Robert Webber, Ancient-Future Faith, p. 46).  Over the past several decades, people largely have abandoned an implicit optimism in humanity—the idea that humans are inherently good and have the intellectual and technological means to make our world increasingly better. Two World Wars, ruthless dictators, and increased acts of brutality--not to mention the tragedy of 9/11--have appropriately awakened our society to the reality of evil.  It’s appropriate for us—God’s people—to appreciate once again the “powers” that Jesus came to bind and dethrone. While Easter is now past, let’s remember that it signaled a moment in history when God engaged in mortal combat with Satan’s hordes and, by the resurrection, won a decisive victory for us (1 Cor. 15:57).  Our hope, therefore, does not lie in our own abilities to make our world a better place. It lies in the fact that Jesus Christ is alive forevermore, and has the keys of hell and death (Rev. 1:18). It is that reality that we celebrate on Easter...and every day. And, may we celebrate--and continue our struggle against evil--as victors with Christ!

       The Power of Grace   Grace. It’s a word that elicits any number of competing ideas. For some, its merely what you say before a meal. For others, its something you work hard to earn. For yet others, it’s tantamount to the soft leniency of a super-sentimental grandfather.  Biblically, it appears, that grace provides both pardon and power. It is that expression of a loving God that extends mercy to the sinner, but also provides the means for transformation. In his book, In The Grip of Grace, Max Lucado tells a story that captures this dual provision of grace.  “During the early days of the Civil War a Union soldier was arrested on charges of desertion. Unable to prove his innocence, he was condemned and sentenced to die a deserter’s death. His appeal found its way to the desk of Abraham Lincoln. The president felt mercy for the soldier and signed a pardon. The soldier returned to service, fought the entirely of the war, and was killed in the last battle. Found within his breast pocket was the signed letter of the president.”  Max’s point seems to be that the pardon (grace) extended to the Union soldier by Lincoln emboldened him to fight faithfully through the war. According to scripture, God’s grace not only pardons our sins, but God the Holy Spirit takes up residence in our hearts, transforming us from the inside out (cf. Eph. 1:13, 19-20; 2:4-10).  The soldier in the story told by Max held close to his heart his leader’s words of pardon. This gave him courage—and steadfastness—in the fight. How much more should the words of God’s grace, coupled with the transforming presence of the Holy Spirit give us confidence for life!

       World's Greatest Dad: More a Challenge Than a Description   As I write these words, we are barely over a day away from Father's Day. This day always conjures up a mixture of emotions within a community. Some grieve the loss of a dad, either to death, desertion, or estrangement. Others celebrate a wonderful--and continued--relationship with this special guy. I'm one of the fortunate ones in this regard. My dad remains with us, healthy, energetic, and one whom I deeply love. Since I'm a minister, I rarely have the opportunity to be with my dad on this special Sunday. Despite our geographical disconnect, I hold him close in my heart and soul.  On Father's Day, though, there is a deeper, inward mixture of emotions for me. These center around my own inward conflict. Through the years, my kids have given me a range of gifts and cards, often inscribed with something like "World's Best Dad" or "Greatest Dad." The most moving gifts on this day are the thoughtful notes from our kids when they just were learning to write. Riddled with misspelled words, and backward letters, these notes convey a sense of their naive, adolescent affection for dear old dad. I will always cherish them.  So, what's the nature of my conflict? It's the age-old internal battle between who you want to be and who you really are. I want to be the World's Greatest Dad for my kids, and appreciate their expressions to that end. I know, however, that I fall entirely too short of such an epithet. It's the very same struggle that Paul confessed--That which I would do, I do not, and that which I would not do, that is what I do! The answer to this frustrating cycle is not in trying to will ourselves to "do better." Strangley, such an approach does not free us from this downward spiral, but gives it even greater strength over us. We are caught in a vicious cycle of "vowing never to do again," and the numbing shame of stumbling into the same infraction. Paul's--and our--answer must center in Jesus Christ. Not in a system that bears His name, but in a dynamic relationship with the risen Lord that opens us up to His righteousness--and power. To be the World's Greatest Dad then, strangley, begins with admitting our human inability to perform this awesome task. Only in such humility can we point our kids to the only One Who can free them from themselves--our Father God. If I can at least point my kids in that direction, while "World's Greatest Dad" would remain entirely too optimistic an epithet for me, I will have done the most important thing a Father can do for his kids. Guys, I hope you will join me in that fatherly goal.

       An Ancient-Future Message   Yes, I admit the title of this blog derives from Robert Webber's book  Ancient-Future Faith  in which Webber challenges many assumptions about "doing church" in today's postmodern culture. There appears to be fresh winds blowing over the landscape of our Western culture that threatens many of our ecclesial presuppositions. For some, these winds are devastating, stressing the fabric of time honored sails that have transported the church over many turbulent seas. For others, these same winds are refreshing, blowing away chaff that for too long has obscured the kernel of authentic Christianity.  In any paradigm shift, there are dangers to avoid and benefits to enjoy. While postmodernity offers its own challenges to the Christian message (e.g., radical ecumenism; unqualified pluralism; decontructionism; etc.), it equally provides an appropriate critique of modernity that long held the church in its dogmatic grip. Strangely, in an attempt to wiggle free of modernity's grip, the church embraced the very assumptions of it's would-be captor. Such is the basic thesis of a powerful little book that I've recently re-read-- The Worldly Church  by C. Leonard Allen, Richard Hughes, and Michael Weed.   Though written in 1988, this little book is refreshingly timely. These writers boldly claim that the Church, in response to an increasingly ego-centric culture, developed a prudential gospel--a message that attempted to provide utilitarian reasons for becoming a Christian. Often, people are persuaded to come to Christ so that their marriage might thrive, that their business might prosper, or that they basically can enjoy a peaceful life. While the authors recognize these are  possible  by products of the Christian faith, they rightfully argue that such is not the call of the gospel. They write:   The call of Christ is not to personal success and peace of mind, but to brokenness, suffering, and service. Neal Plantinga put it well: "We are intended to please God--not the other way around--and the idea that Christianity is something we adopt for what it will pay us in happiness and personal mastery is an idea which must be explicitly discouraged" (p. 61).   In an equally powerful critique of the prudential gospel, these writers correctly remind us:   The scandal of the gospel today is that the gospel speaks only of a God-made person, while our culture glorifies the self-made person. The scandal today is the gospel call to surrender self, to offer self to God and his service, when the world calls only for self-enhancement. The scandal is that the heavens are open; that the sovereign God comes to rule this world and all who live therin; that salvation is by divine power, not human achievement or technique. The scandal is that we must be confronted with the depths of human evil and deceit before we can know the heights of grace" (p. 65).   In my conversation with many postmoderns, this type message seems to resonate. It appears that the up and coming generation, while also struggling with their own expressions of egocentricity, is looking for something authentic. Not a utilitarian-oriented message of self-help and self-enhancement, but one that challenges those leanings. The radical call of Jesus to self-denial is an ancient-future message whose time has returned. The question now is, can churches who have built their very identity around a prudential gospel speak--or even hear--this truth?

       Books Worth Reading   I've recently read, and re-read, a couple of books by Gregory Boyd:  God at War  and  Satan and the Problem of Evil . While at times, it's easy to get bogged down in Boyd's philosophical discussions, the book is a refreshing--and fascinating--read.   Basically Boyd writes from an Arminian perspective, but does so with sensitivity to Calvinistic leanings. He argues against the Augustinian blue print world view in which God controls everything that occurs within our world. In such a model, then, our struggle is to determine the good that God is formulating through tragedy--even the most brutal expressions of it.  Against this Augustinian blue print model, Boyd proposes a Trinitarian warfar theodicy in which free will, at least in a finite sense, implies that beings, both human and angelic, have the capability to temporarily thwart the will of God. Boyd argues then, that the question of evil involves more than just humans and God, since our world is inhabited by a host of non-human beings, all of whom have free will. From this perspective, Boyd argues that expressions of evil are not necessarily the result of God bringing about some good. Contrarily, rebellious beings can bring about evil in our world simply because they have the freedom to do so. Not everything, then, according to Boyd, is in harmony with God's purposes. While God's sovereignty is established, it constantly is being challenged by opposed forces, i.e., Satan and his hosts. And, though God ultimately, and completely will triumph over evil (which is guaranteed by Jesus' victory on the cross and resurrection), we live in a virtual war zone in which defeated foes continually attempt to regain that which was lost.  The Christian life, then, is to be primarily viewed from a military perspective. God is at war; we are at war with him. It, therefore, is important for us to be faithful to our post. Boyd, I think, does a good job of fleshing out this perspective, making for a fascinating and provocative read. This is a perspective that the church needs to re-investigate, especially in our largely politically correct North American culture.

       Longing for There...Fully Present Here    The past two weeks have been&nbsp;especially difficult for me. The difficulty arises, not from the stresses of ministry, but from an increasing longing to depart. Over a month ago, Carol, my wife, and I made reservations for a 7 nights stay on Florida's emerald coast. We've never been away for such an extended period strictly for recreational purposes, and in such a beautiful area. As the time for&nbsp;the trip&nbsp;has neared, I've struggled to remain "engaged" in my work.   When we first made these reservations, I created a calendar, complete with pictures of our destination, so we could "mark off the days" as our trip neared. As the large "x's" through each day increased on this homemade calander, our whole family's excitement increased proportionately. Food for the trip covers our dining room table. Floats, beach chairs, and a variety of swimming accoutrements are neatly placed in our garage, just waiting to be loaded in our van. With all of this stuff "sanctified" for a particular purpose in our home, I found myself "already there" while I have "not yet" fully experienced the beach. I've even picked up some of this stuff, pretending to be relaxing on the sugar white sands of my home state--sounds weird, I know, but I just couldn't help myself.   This tension of living between the times, however, speaks to our Christian reality--at least I think it should. New Testament writers spoke of the  eschaton , the consumation of the ages, in expectant terms (cf. Romans 8:18-25; 1 Corinthians 7:29-31; 1Peter1:3-9). For them, they were "already there" but had "not yet" fully experienced this ultimate reality. They were "marking the days" when they could be fully present with the Lord.   Two particular points&nbsp;come to mind as I'm reflecting on such eschatological concerns. First, Christians need to recapture a sense of "longing to be there." I wonder to what extent I've become too attached to this fallen world--the world that is in the process of "passing away." I admit,&nbsp;my microcosm is not that bad of a place to live. Nice family. Nice house. Really nice Church. Perhaps this might be one reason why Christians in the United States in particular have become so complacent over the years--why I've become so complacent. Do I, like the early Christians, begin my day with the sincere desire: "Maranatha," (O Lord, Come)?   Second, the longing for the consumation of the ages does not mean that we disengage from our current world--at least it shouldn't mean that. In some way, it--the entire physical creation--is the object of God's redemptive work (Romans 8:18-25). While we might debate the specific details of this eschatological dimension, God is working to reverse the curse from every&nbsp;aspect of His creation. And, His people are to join him in that struggle. "Maranatha" on our lips, then, is not so much a wistful longing to leave this world, but a battle cry for God's kingdom to fully dawn. Didn't Jesus teach us to pray, "Your kingdom come, Your will be done,   on earth as it is in heaven  ?"   Well, that's enough reflection for today. After all, I'm leaving for the beach tomorrow!

       Honduras Bound     &nbsp;  This evening, 16 of our folks from CrossBridge will begin the trek to Tegucagalpa, Honduras for a week-long mission effort. Though I won't be making the trip to Central America, I am driving a portion of the group to Nashville. There, they will join another church group and fly to Tegucagalpa via Miami.  &nbsp;  My heart will be in Honduras with them. The people in this region are desperately in need of the basics. This group, as many others do throughout the summer months, will build houses (really basic, one room structures), treat the sick (a number are medical personnel), work among the orphans (taking them clothes, shoes and toys), and basically love the children in that region.  &nbsp;  This trip, and the images that remain forever etched in my heart, remind me of Jesus' statement: "inasmuch as you've done it unto one of the least of these, my brothers, you have done it unto me." Jurgen Moltmann, a German theologian, has written prolifically in the area of ecclesiology. In one of his monumental books,  The Church in the Power of the Spirit , Moltmann elaborates on the concept&nbsp;he calls&nbsp; ubi Christus, ibi ecclesia . The basic meaning of this phrase is "Where Christ is, there is the church." Reflecting on the Matthew 25 text, Moltmann highlights the fact that Jesus uses familial language regarding the "least of these" when speaking to those who ministered to the disenfranchised. He called them "brothers." Contrarily, Jesus does not again use the familial modifier when speaking to those who refused help.  &nbsp;  From this omission, Moltmann argues that Jesus was reminding the Matthean community--and all subsequent Christian communities--that in embracing the "least of these" they were unwittingly embracing Him. And, where he is, there is the church--the people of God. Moltmann, in the liberationist theological tradition, seems to be arguing that the real church, then, is found among the disenfranchised, not among good religious folk.  &nbsp;  While Moltmann likely pushes the point too far, he does make an important statement. While we talk about "bringing Christ" to the poor in our mission efforts, this text reminds us that, in so doing, we paradoxically find him there. May we see in the aching eyes of everyone in need a reflection of Jesus...and may we embrace Him there.  &nbsp;  Pray for all Christians everywhere who take mission trips this summer that they might experience Christ among the "least of these."

       Figs and Faith   &nbsp;  Today I attempted to preach on Mark's account of Jesus' cursing the fig tree (Mark 11:12-25). I'm not sure where I heard or read the phrase "Optic Parable," but Mark appears to use them generously. An "optic parable" as I use it, is where Mark presents a historical miracle, which utlimately refers to some spiritual reality. The blind man, for instance, who was incrementally healed by Jesus, stood as a fitting representative of the disciples' distorted vision regarding Jesus' Messiahship (Mark 8:22-26). Like the blind man, they needed a "second touch" to see clearly who Jesus was. Until they understood the true nature of Jesus' Messiahship, they simply could not understand--or see--clearly what discipleship was all about. Between chapters 8 and 10, Jesus juxtaposes teaching about his messiahship, which involved a cross, and discipleship, which equally involved a cross (cf. Mark 8:31-38; 9:39-37; 10:32-45). Until they understood the basic self-sacrificial orientation of Jesus' Messiahship, they would alway struggled with a power-oriented discipleship that would forever have them lusting for positions of privilege in the kingdom.  &nbsp;  Another literary technique judiciously used by Mark is the "chiasmus" structure. Deriving its name from the Greek letter "chi" (which looks somewhat like the English letter x), this literary device occurs when a particular story is interrupted by another event, after which the initial story is completed. Rather than indicating the Gospel writer's "scattered mind" in telling stories, this technique appears to be an intentional design to bring emphasis to the overall point. In the case of Jesus' cursing the fig tree, for example, Mark tells the initial portion of Jesus' cursing the fig tree for its lack of fruit (11:12-14). The narrative then moves to Jesus' reaction to the moneychangers in the temple complex, prophetically indicting them of transforming God's house of prayer into a den of robbers (11:13-19). After this story, Mark provides the conclusion to the fig tree episode (11:20-21). According to the&nbsp;chiasmus literary structure,&nbsp;the story within the story, rather than a wreckless interruption becomes the focus of the writer's point. If the chiasmus structure obtains&nbsp;in the case&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;the cursing of the fig tree (and I think it does),&nbsp;the barren fig tree and&nbsp;God's people in the time of Jesus had something in common.&nbsp;Just as the fig tree boasted of figs (its foliage implied fruit) but had none, so the religious leaders of Jesus' day presented a display of righteousness, but in actuality, their faith was vacuous. The very people that God intended to "bless the nations," had become a sad display of consumerism, becoming an obstacle to those who sought to draw near to God. Just as Jesus cursed the fig tree, which subsequently withered, so the Jewish nation, due to its "barrenness of faith," similarly would meet its demise.  &nbsp;  In my sermon today, I wondered about the state of God's people. We have been called to be the body of Christ, salt and light in our broken world. Have we lost our "saltiness?" Have our lamps grown dim? In a postmodern world that is confused, do we boldly point to Jesus Christ, the only one who can save, or do we insist on fiddling with externals? Because we spend an inordinate amount of time arguing about how to correctly "do church," our world does not receive the blessing of Christ's body. I'm afraid that too often hungry people eventually stumble into our presence, but find nothing but leaves.  &nbsp;  This is true regardless of one's worship style. It can be true of traditional churches as well as more contemporary churches. If we remain focused on such externals, our tree might look inviting, but there is no substance there.  &nbsp;  The church is to offer the redemptive love of Christ to our world. A love that says "Neither do I condemn you...leave your life of sin." When church becomes a place for sinners authentically to experience such love, then, and only then, are we a fruitful tree. God grant your people the grace to be your body...and start with me!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       An Epiphany at the Feet of Jesus    On Tuesday of next week, a team from CrossBridge will travel to Tegucagalpa, Honduras for its annual mission trip to that region. Unlike the past several years, and due to a conflicting schedule, I will not be able to make the trip this year. As I've been reflecting on this trip, though, I remember an epipahny I had last year while working among the poor in this region. &nbsp; We stayed at a hotel on the foot of a beautiful mountain on whose summit stood&nbsp;a 60 meter high statue of Jesus. With arms outstretched, it appeared as if&nbsp;Jesus were blessing and protecting the large city--exactly the intent of its Catholic architects. In past years, I always saw this statue, but the frenetic nature of the trip never allowed for an excursion up to this moving sight. &nbsp; Last year was different. Our group, on Sunday evening, made our way to the sight of the "Big Jesus" as I affectionately referred to it. As we made the drive up the precariously, twisting roads to this sight, I became increasingly excited, almost nervous. I realize that I wasn't going to encounter the "real thing," but the place seemed to be holy nonetheless. &nbsp; When we arrived at the entrance to the sight, I hurried off the bus and headed down the trail. The group that followed thought I knew where I was going--I really didn't. Just like in the states, a "real man" doesn't ask for directions! We came to a fork in the road. No signs. I couldn't see Jesus. Since the trail to the left continued uphill, I assumed that was the way to go, and off I went. I made it only a few yards down the trail when Steve Wilson, a great friend and member at CrossBridge,&nbsp;spotted Jesus in the direction of the opposite trail. Much to the delight of the crowd, Steve remarked: "Now isn't that just like a preacher, leading us away from Jesus." Yeah, a lot of truth to that light-hearted remark. &nbsp; While that remark itself truly was a convicting truth that pricked my heart,&nbsp;what happened next embedded that&nbsp;nail&nbsp;deeply into my soul. Once we arrived at the foot of Jesus, the entire area was surrounded by a large stone wall that stood about 8 feet high. Embedded in the wall were iron gates. All of them were locked. I then remarked out loud, "Now that's a stunning metaphor of religion. Jesus calls with outstretched arms, 'Come to me,' but us good religious folk build walls around him--and serve as gate keepers to those who wearily&nbsp;come to him." &nbsp; That's when I had the epiphany, and I nearly wept. I began to realize that Christians often do place barriers around Jesus. How we "do church" becomes more important than an encounter with the living Christ. I wondered that day how many of those stones have I placed alongside all my other, well-intentioned Christians from various traditions. I resolved at that moment to turn from worshipping at the shrines&nbsp;Church externals, and fall at the feet of Jesus. I further resolved to redefine my ministry. Rather than serving as the one to allow passage into Jesus presence through my theologically-constructed gates, I want to usher them authentically into the presence of the only One Who can save.&nbsp;Since last year I've learned that the transformation of people's lives occurs, not at the gate, but at his feet. Once there, the very goal of relgion--transformed lives--becomes a reality. "Oh Lord Jesus, give us all the grace to stay out of your way in people's lives, and grant us eyes to see your holy work in hearts...even when it doesn't conform to our religious protocol. And begin with me!" &nbsp; By the way, we did make it to Jesus' feet that night. A well-worn path around the wall led to an opening through which many found access to Jesus. (I'm still not sure it was sanctioned, but we went through anyway). Another epiphany, people who want to get to the Lord will find a path, circumventing our well-thought out, protocols of religious traditions. Reminds of the story when the blind man, because he encountered and accepted Jesus, lost his access to the community (John 9). God save us from this spirit religious spirit! &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Volleyball Theology     &nbsp;  Once again, I've been playing on a recreational coed volleyball league this season. Our team consists of women and men from CrossBridge. So far, we've won a few and lost just as many. But, we've had a blast--at least I have. Those with a more serious competitive--and capable--edge might not be happy with our season. It's been fun, though, as a minister to get to know my fellow CrossBridgians in this different context.  &nbsp;  I've learned a few things from this whole ordeal. One person simply cannot do very well. There's too much ground, er, wood to cover. It's also true that whatever happens to one person, happens to them all. While I might have played a stellar game (only in my dreams), if we are beaten, everyone is beaten. Contrarily, even when I play my typical error-ridden game, I get to experience the thrill of victory when that occurs.  &nbsp;  While these are great lessons for the church, I stumbled across a most important theological reality during last week's game. Typically, a game is lost or won based upon how well a team   serves  . "If anyone wants to be great, let him be the servant of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and give his life as a ransom for many." Greatness through one's service is true not only of individuals (or volleyball teams) but of churches as well. It's probably time that we heed this basic call, becoming salt and light to our increasing bland and dark society.

       A Humurous Tale; A Somber Reminder   I received the following email from a friend. I--and likely many of you--have seen a version of this story. I was reminded again of how Christians are all-too willing to shed blood over nuanced differences in church polity.     I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off.  I ran over to him and said, "Stop!  Don't do it!"   "Why shouldn't I?" he said.  I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!"  He said, "Like what?" I said, "Well. . .are you religious or atheist?" He said, "Religious."   "Me, too!"  I said.  "Are you Christian or Buddhist?" He said, "Christian." I said, "Me too!  Are you Catholic or protestant" He said, "Protestant."   I said, "Me too!  Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?" He said, "Baptist."   I said, "Wow!  Me too!  Are you Baptist church of God or Baptist church of the Lord?" He said, "Baptist church of God."   I said, "Me, too.  Are you original Baptist church of God, or are you reformed Baptist church of God?" He said,"Reformed Baptist church of God."  I said, "Me too!  Are you reformed Baptist church of God, reformation of 1879, or reformed Baptist church of God, reformation of 1915?" He said, "Reformed Baptist church of God, reformation of 1915!"   I said, "Die, heretic scum," and pushed him off.   This is not intended to identify only one denominational expression of Christianity as suffering from highly nuanced forms of "doing church." It's a reminder that all Christians tend to move in such directions. My own heritage has historically excelled in the area of such a sectarian spirit. May we be one, Father, as you and your Son, Jesus, are one. And, may we love one another as you have loved us...so the world might know that we are your disciples.

       Guess What Happened in Church Today?   Depending on one's perspective, this question could be negative or positive. Too often, I've been on the receiving end of such a question, only to hear the querist describe an "uncomfortable situation" he or she experienced. On the other hand, I've also heard this interrogative remark followed by a moving depiction of God at work in an assembly.  CrossBridge is one of those places where the unusual is the usual. Yesterday was an unforgettable first, both for our church and for yours truly. In my 19 years of ministry, I've performed many weddings in a variety of settings, e.g., church buildings, homes, backyards, pool sides, chapels. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to join a loving couple in holy matrimony during our Sunday morning worship.  Admittedly, I wondered about how this was going to work. Was it going to force worshipers to participate in two strangers' marriage ceremony? How would it be received? Would it be a moving moment of experiencing the triune love of God concretely displayed, or would it be perceived as a gimmick, a spectacle of human hubris?  A couple of things coelesced to ease my mind. First, an organization devoted to family values sent out a nation-wide email, urging ministers and pastors to preach on the sanctity of marriage on the Sunday in question. Second, a lunch with the couple revealed their honest desire not to be the centerpiece of the service. They simply wanted to vow their commitment to each other at the end of the sermon.  Though quite different from anything we've ever experienced before, the entire service was a meaningful encounter with God. LifeSong, the worship team at CrossBridge, did an absolutely fabulous job in moving all of us into the presence of God through amazing songs. Jack and Julie exchanged their vows, much to the delight of all. As far as the sermon, someone with a bit more objectivity would need to judge!  Upon reflection, and after hearing many positive responses to the service, I began to better understand why this experience was so generally moving. Paul spoke of the mysterious marriage relationship as a reflection of Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:32). Jack and Julie stood as concrete expressions of the relational mystery between Jesus and each of us--His church. As they said "Yes" to one another, we were experiencing God's "yes" to us in the context of worship. In turn, we all were moved to utter our own unique "yes" to Him as well.  In a day when marriage is under viscious attack, it was a holy moment to see two people, commit to one another in the most appropriate place of all--in the context of a worshipping community. My prayers are with Jack and Julie as they begin their life together as husband and wife. And, I am profoundly appreciative of them both for allowing God to use the rather ordinary recitation of marriage vows to become a catalyst for praise...and transformation.  Guess what happened in church today....

       At Peace In The Storm   Have you ever had one of those days when everything—absolutely everything—went, not only as you planned, but exceeded your wildest imagination of the most perfect day? The kids woke up on their own, dressed themselves, and brought you breakfast in bed before they walked to the bus stop? Your presentation resulted in a promotion, 100% pay raise, and won you company-wide accolades—all before 9:00 a.m.? The Reader’s Digest van actually showed up in your driveway with the $1,000,000 prize?  While such astonishing days theoretically are possible, our days typically flow at a frenzied pace, sometimes causing us to struggle just to survive the emotional, physical, and spiritual strains of living. Deadlines. Company sales quotas. Corporate downsizing. Family tension. How can we find peace in the midst of such surging storms?  The world has set forth its prescriptions. Magazines offer “Ten Ways to Beat Busyness.” Corporate trainers promote “proven techniques for stress-free living.” Travel agents claim peace is available in Hawaii—for only $3,000! (This one sounds most promising...until the credit card bill comes due.) In our candid moments, however, we realize that techniques alone don’t produce lasting serenity. Our excitement over new programs for stress-free living can quickly cool. And, even an island paradise cannot guarantee sustained contentment for a troubled soul.  God knows that peace cannot be compressed neatly into a program or a place, but in a dynamic relationship with a Person—Jesus (John 14:27). While the peace offered by the world is short-lived and shallow, the peace of Christ is immeasurable and eternal. His peace transcends human understanding and earthly circumstances (Philippians 4:7,12).  By remaining meaningfully connected to Christ, we can be at peace when corporate representatives invade our offices. We can experience serenity in the midst of screaming kids, ringing phones, and unexpected visits from relatives. We even can remain calm when our car breaks down on the way to a job interview or when death makes its unwelcome visit.  The real secret to peace during the irritating storms of life is to abide in Christ. Such peace is not an escape from the irritants--or challenges--of this broken world. On the contrary, its fully embracing those irritants and challenges with the faith that our future is secure in Jesus Christ. And, it further reflects a conviction that God's sovereign will utlimately will prevail...on earth as it is in heaven. May God grant us such peace.

       Leading as a Bondservant   I've been leading a men's class on Tuesday nights based on a book by Steve Arterburn and Fred Stoeker titled "Every Woman's Desire." Though I've been the one facilitating our conversations, I've been the benefactor of great insights from the men in this class.  The past couple of classes dealt specifically with biblical leadership, and what that actually looks like. Taking their cue from Exodus 21:2-6, Arterburn and Stoeker argue for a bondservant model of leadership. According to this code, a Hebrew who, due to times of hardship, sells himself into slavery was to be released in the seventh year. If, during his years of servitude, he marries a wife and has children, they actually belong to his master. At the end of sevens years, he then has a choice. The man alone could go free, or decide to remain in slavery with his family. The text reads; "But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,' then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierve his ear with and awl. Then he will be his servant for life" (v. 5).  While many details of this text raise perplexing questions, heightened by the cultural differences between ancient Israel and contemporary North America, two relevant points stand out. (1) While prevailing circumstances coerced the man initially into slavery, bondservanthood was his choice. (2) The choice of bonservanthood was compelled by his love for his master and his family.  Arterburn and Stoeker, appropriately emphasizing mutual submission in marriage, use this text to underscore the true nature of biblical leadership. They apply the metaphor of "master" to the wife--the one whom the husband has been called to serve (just as Jesus served his bride, the church).  While Arterburn and Stoeker speak relevant truth using this structure, our conversations about this text revealed a subtle, but very important, distinction to their interpretation. The text makes the point that both the man and his family belong to the master. Neither the man nor the wife was "master." They both were owned by the one who purchased them. Therefore, the way he related to his wife and children was dictated by this construct of ownership. The way he treated his family reflected on his relationship to the master. To serve them, then, was an extension of his servitude to his master, whom he loves.  By analogy, we need to keep in mind that we are not our own; we have been bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:19). Additionally, the special people in our lives are not ours, they equally belong to another. My wife and children (brothers and sisters in Christ), then, are my master's. To honor him, I must honor them. Biblical leadership, then, does not derive from one's position of power, but from one's recognition of belonging to another. From that position of servanthood, then, derives the biblical concept of leadership. As with Jesus, authority is expressed, not in being served, but in serving and giving one's life for others (Matthew 20:20-28; John 13:1-5). Such is the overarching paradigm for all leadership...in the home and the church. May God grant us true leaders who understand this basic biblical principle!

       Oh, Say Can You See?   Reflections on Independence Day   As I pen these words, July 4th already has passed into the mist of human memory. Since July 4 fell on Sunday this year (thanks to LifeSong for such a memorable worship experience), Monday was the official day off for most folk. Such was the case for me, at least.  The day was filled with very little activity really. It seemed to lazily drag along. There were the usual things. Hamburgers. Watermelon. More Fireworks. In fact, neigbhors at this moment are shooting off the remander of their pyrotechnic stash (I hope they'll be finished by bedtime).  Throughout this rather lazy day, I have reflected on the meaning of Idependence Day. As I watched, and assisted in sending whistling fireballs into the air, I kept thinking about our National Anthem. Not only is the song's range one of the most difficult to vocally navigate, it's words equally are challenging. Not so much their pronunciation or even their meaning. Few folks likely fully understand Francis Scott Keys emotions as he described "Old Glory" intermittently illuminated by the "rockets' red glare," and "bombs bursting in air." From his perch on an unnamed British vessel, where he was detained, 8 miles below Fort McHenry during it's bombardment, Key strained throughout the night to determine the direction of the fight. To his utter delight, the flag remained flying proudly, though tattered, over the fort. This sight inspired him to write the "Star Spangled Banner."  Written to the tune of an English tavern song (Anacreon in Heaven), Key's lyrics to this English tune finally became our national anthem in 1931. While we are most familiar with only the first stanza, there actually are a total of four. The last stanza in particular is of great relevance to our current cultural situation. One can nearly feel the emotions of this Episcopalian swell as he scribbled on a piece of paper these final words to a moving song:   Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand  Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!  Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land  Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.  Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!    In our post-Christian, pluralistic world, perhaps we should dust off this old stanza and reflect on it's sentiments. Key saw our nation (as reflected in the tenacity of Fort McHenry) "heaven-resuced," preserved by "the Power" who should be praised, and one whose motto should ever be "In God is our trust." In reality, then, our "Idependence" was seen by those who fought for it as ultimately "dependent" on our God. May the church universal remind our culture of the One Who holds our nation in His sovereign hands. And, may he preserve us!

       Seeking His Face   Over the past several years, I’ve appreciated the change in nomenclature among folks in my Christian tribe. As a child, I don’t recall hearing phrases like, “Holy Spirit Reign” or “Praise Jesus,” or “We want to know You,” or “Guide us with Your Spirit.” Perhaps these were basic thoughts among the community, and I simply failed to grasp them. What I do recall is much talk about “Scriptural” things.  Whenever a question about methodology or a hypothetical situation was considered, the primary expressed concern was “Is it scriptural?” This concern actually exhibited a healthy appreciation for God’s written word, which I equally share. I’ve learned through experience and continued formal study, however, that “scriptural” can be an elastic term, having a diversity of meanings. One’s hermeneutical orientation typically determines its basic meaning. So, I’ve learned that we humans tend to navigate toward a “hermeneutic of hubris,” one that actually supports our understandings, rather than challenging them. As  urlLink Richard Hughes , et.al., cogently wrote in  The Worldy Church , the real challenge is not to stand “on the word,” but “under the word.” Sacred hermeneutics, or biblical interpretation, then, is not so much about interpreting scripture as it is allowing scripture to interpret us. For me, this is more than a neat twist in phraseology; it is the real task of every reader of scripture.  What prompted me to take the preceding brief glance down a long, twisting path that literally spans centuries is the change in nomenclature that I mentioned at the beginning of this blog. While formerly I would hear people wondering about the “Scripturality” of something, I now hear folk wondering if someone has been “guided by the Spirit” into a particular ministry, task, or move. I must say, that the latter moves closer to the real essence of Christianity, at least as far as language goes. But, I must wonder if the only real change has been linguistic, rather than attitudinal?  While some of us now understand that being “Scriptural” can be nothing more than one’s selfish (dare I say, Pharisaical) positions buttressed by a litany of passages that gives the appearance of biblical guidance, must we not bring our new lingo under equal scrutiny? Is it possible that “being guided by the Spirit” can shroud the same selfish (dare I say, Pharisaical) posture with a new linguistic cloak?  I’ve wondered lately about my own sense of “seeking God’s face.” Several years ago, Miranda, our youngest daughter (now 9 yrs. old) highlighted an often-overlooked dimension to this essential concept. She was still young enough to be in a car seat. While driving in our minivan with Carol, my wife, Miranda was talking to her mother. Being the conscientious mother—and driver—that she is, Carol kept her eyes straight on the road, occasionally glancing at Miranda in the rear view mirror. This simply did not satisfy our daughter. Miranda’s tone built into a near scream. “Mom! Mom!” Miranda yelled with frustration in her voice. “What sweetie?” Carol replied with equal frustration. “I’m listening!” Unsatisfied, Miranda responded, “But you’re not listening with your face!”  Hmmm. Not listening with your face. Does God feel that way about those of us who now speak of “being guided by Him?” How often have I laid out strategic plans for my life, or ministry, and only paid lip service to “seeking his face?” Has God only seen my eyes in a rear view mirror as I drive my life’s minivan along a self-chosen highway? I wonder if God ever feels like we aren’t listening to Him with our faces. You see if we truly are seeking God’s face, He should see more than the backs of our heads as we go about our activities all the while pleading his blessings on them.  Oh Lord, give us the grace to come squarely face to face with you…and listen. Guide us, O God with your Spirit into realms yet unknown. And start with me!

         A Unique Guy   I missed two successive Sundays at CrossBridge, and I mean I really missed them. I know there are wonderful communities of faith all over the globe, both in and out of my particular tradition. For me, at least, there's no place like [my] home [church]. I haven't always been able to say that, eventhough I've been the preacher at "my home church" since 1985.  There are many reasons why I feel this way--and why others feel this way about their special community. One of the primary reasons is my good friend and ministerial colleague,  urlLink Greg Miles . I've got to brag about my brother just a little.  Greg holds down a very responsible position at AmSouth bank. Most folk are amazed that Greg is not a paid staff member at CrossBridge, especially in light of all that he's involved in with LifeSong, the music ministry here. It was his leadership, inspired by the Zoe worship conference several years ago, that brought into existence LifeSong. Since LifeSong's debut in January 2000, CrossBridge has morphed into a community of sincere seekers of God. All glory is God's for this, of course. But, Greg has allowed God to use him.  Since the inception of LifeSong, Greg has led worship here on a weekly basis. He puts together astonishing ppt presentations for each weeks worship, keeps LifeSong's repertoire continually growing, insures that LifeSong is ready each week via a midweek practice and Sunday morning sound check (he usually beats me to the building each Sunday). On top of these--and other--weekly ministry responsibilities, LifeSong, under his capable leadership, has produced three CDs. Each of these has a professional quality to them that expresses Greg's commitment to excellence.  And, did I mention that LifeSong is "an aside" for Greg? Amazing!  Let me tell you a little about his heart. If there is a song that captures the essence of Greg's desire, it would be "The Heart of Worship" (I hope that's the actual title to this song.) For Greg, his ministry is "not about him," it's "all about God." In fact, he's probably going to be really embarassed by this blog. Sorry Greg.  Over the years he's been a great support to me. I really want him to know how much I love and appreciate him. I also hope that others in the kingdom will have the opportunity to be blessed by Greg and LifeSong.  BTW, this blog was inspired by my having a great lunch with Greg today. It's always an encouragement to eat a burger or some hot wings and fries with such a great friend.

       In Need of Eyes to See     Political pundits these days are ubiquitous. It's a presidential election year and the rhetoric is heating up, not only from the particular candidates, but from the analysts as well. I've heard several talking heads make the apparently correct observation that partisan politics is at an all time high. That might be an overstatement. I'm sure there have been occasions in our country where passions surrounding an election ran at an equally--if not higher--emotional pitch.  It does appear, however, that lines are being sharply drawn. So much so that if someone from the opposing party speaks truth, somehow, due to its origin, it must be false. Not only is this true of the political world, it's historically been sadly true of religious folk. And, I'm not talking here of different religions primarily, but of the diversity within our own Christian fraternity. As our world become increasingly cynical, confused, and searching for some substance, the body of Christ needs to figure out how to appropriately respond. With questions of abortion, homosexuality, and many other social difficulties, the church must offer an alternative to the rancorous rhetoric. It must, it seems to me, express radical, redemptive love just as Jesus did to the broken of his culture. For this to occur, we need to see folks through the eyes of God. An old Hassidic tale summarizes much of what our churches need so desperately today.  The Rabbi asks his students, “How can we determine the hour of dawn, when the night ends and the day begins?”  One student suggests, “When, from a distance, you can distinguish between a dog and a sheep?” “No,” the Rabbi answers.  “Is it when you can distinguish between a fig tree and a grapevine?” asks a second student. “No,” the Rabbi says.  “Please tell us the answer, then,” say the perplexed students.  “It is,” says the wise teacher, ”when you have enough light to look human beings in the face and recognize them as your brothers and sisters. Until then the darkness is still with us.”  If you think about it, this rabbinical saying is packed with insight into the human condition. Typically, how we see or perceive a situation or individual determines how we feel. Our feelings in turn heavily influence how we respond. In the end, if our vision is blurred by prejudices or self interests, our reaction to others will be influenced accordingly.  Jesus had eyes focused by divine lenses. This resulted, not in a pious attempt to insulate his holiness from sin, but a tender compassion to counter their sin with his holiness. Where some saw sinners to be avoided, Jesus saw potential children of God. Where some saw the need to shun disease, Jesus saw the opportunity to show deliverance. Where some saw trouble, Jesus saw triumph. Where most saw death, Jesus gave life. Where some saw unworthy lives, Jesus saw people worthy of His own death.  As Jesus engaged his broken world so we are to engage ours. Faces and times have changed, but the need remains the same. May God remove the darkness and grant us eyes to recognize all humans beings as his special creation in desperate need of God’s love. Again, O, Lord, begin with me!

       Community of the Cross   This morning, I enjoyed an early breakfast with Wes McCannell, a relatively new member at CrossBridge. Over the past few months, my appreciation for Wes has grown in direct proportion to my increased knowledge of him. He's a reflective type who enjoys good conversation about theology and culture as much as I do.  After my conversation with Wes over grits, eggs, sausage and coffee, I was in a particularly contemplative mood. What does it mean to be the body of Christ in our current culture? Where is that frayed line between where it's appropriate to accomodate culture and where Christians must confront it? What does it mean to be worldly or to "live godly in the present age?" These are at least some of the questions with which Christians must struggle.  As I walked into my book-strewn office, I noticed a particular volume that I've read through on several occasions. It's one of those books that I periodically thumb through, and read particular sections. Written by Charles Colson with Ellen Santilli Vaughn,  The Body: Being Light in Darkness , was an award-wining, national bestseller in 1993. Although written over a decade ago, Colson's words ring with relevance.  In this book, Colson tells a story of the town of Nowa Huta, Poland, soon after World War II. "Constructed in the 1950s as a living monument to Communist utopianism, Nowa Huta, or 'New Town,' was originally designed as a center for the workers who would make up the backbone of the New Poland" (p. 195). The epitomy of modern design, Nowa Huta was an industrial center whose skyline consisted of "mammoth steel works" and "ugly chimneys" that belched out their sulfuric fumes into the skies of Southern Poland (p. 195).  Early in the town's construction, a vacant square caught the attention of all the workers. According to Colson, this empty space represented the vacuum left by the frenzied urban planning of the Communists--there was no church; no place for worship.  The workers aked for a church. The Communist authorities were irritated by this request. Their design provided everything a human possibly could need--hot and cold water, a place to sleep and eat. The Communists bought time by nodding in agreement; "Fine," they said, "No problem."  While awaiting the construction of a place of worship, several young Christians and a Polish priest erected a rough-hewn cross on the vacant sight, to mark the place where the chapel eventually would sit. Soon, however, the authorities refused to build the chapel, and finally attempted to thwart the people from gathering at the place by removing the cross.  Determined, the citizens restored the cross and assembled there to sing, receive communion and fellowship with fellow Christians. Despite the Communists' attempts to quash these assemblies (tearing down the cross repeatedly, dispersing the people with water canons), the unflenching Christians returned to the site for worship.  In conclusion to this historical event, Colson writes: "This went on for years--the authorities tearing down the cross and the people restoring it. And in the midst of the struggle the people came to a realization that would steel their faith in a way that Communism could never steal their souls. 'The church is not a building,' they said to one another. 'The church is us, celebrating the presence of our Lord among us! Praise be to God!'"  In our current cultural climate, I think we need to listen to these words of our Polish Christian brothers and sisters. As long as we are a community of the cross, celebrating the presence of our Lord among us, the church exists. No law, or the lack thereof, no constitutional ammendment or the lack thereof can steal this ultimate reality from us. And, only embracing that ultimate reality are we truly being light in the darkness, and inserting leven into the cultural lump. Start with me, O, Lord!

       All Linked Up   It probably matters very little to you veteren bloggers who have mastered html, but I figured out how to recreate my links! I'm pretty pumped about this. Also, if you've posted a comment and received an undeliverable email message, I've fixed that too...I hope. I can now rest a little easier knowing that I'm all linked up!

       HTML and Christian Linguistics   I've been blogging for several months now, and have enjoyed this casual format for posting--and reading--rambling thoughts. Having become more relaxed with posting blogs, I ventured into the untested waters of  html  (which, I think, stands for hyper text markup language--or something like that). I set sail into this linguistic deep because I wanted to add additional links to my blogsite, and to post links to other blogsites on my sidebar menu. After several frustrating attempts, I finally was able to create a new heading for other blogs and provide a link to those sites.  Feeling pretty confident of my ability to manipulate templates, I succumbed to the temptation to change templates. After all, in our postmodern age, change is the name of the game. I just didn't feel like my previous template was striking enough. So, I chose this current template, republished the blog, and  viola , I've got a new look.  I ignored the warning that changing blogs would remove all personalized items from my page. With my new understanding of  html , I certainly would be able to recreate all of my links. That was Sunday. It's now Tuesday...and I don't have a clue how to recreate them. The  html  of the new template, while similar, has some peculiarities. The commands within the little <> and " or /= are slightly different. And, I'm frustrated. I want to go back to my old template where I was more comfortable in manipulating the  html!   Change. I understand why we resist it. Like many folk, I like to be in familiar territory--it makes me feel a little more in charge. I don't have to consider new methods. I don't have to burn brain cells contemplating the implications of new insights. After all, I've already devoted much time and energy to learning the "old ways!"  In this frustration, however, I'm learning something about the call of the church to our current culture. I wonder to what extent our accepted Christian jargon seems like "Greek" or worse still "html" to our culture? We speak of grace, love, redemption, atonement, communion, baptism, etc., all of which means at least something to us. I wonder what these concepts communicate to our world? Without doubt, people--even Christian folk--need to be moved into this important language, Christian  html , if you will. For, until we get there, our Christian walk will be superficial indeed. In our current cultural situation, however, the church needs to be the living interpretation of these underlying concepts. We need not first speak of grace, and redemptive love, but demonstrate them. When this happens, perhaps more folk will want to venture into the deeper waters of our language.  We'll, I've just talked myself into giving this new template another try. If it looks funny for a few days, just know this novice is tinkering with the template.

       I'm Back     My family and I just returned from a wonderful week at Seaside beach, an idyllic setting near Destin, Florida. Thanks to everyone at CrossBridge who made this trip a possibility. To Zane Tarence and Adam Ellis, who preached on July 25 and Aug. 1 respectively, I am eternally grateful. Thanks to H.C. Johnson, Jim Lovell, and Lynn Gurganus who covered my teaching responsibilities at CrossBridge while I was "soaking up the sun." Thanks also to Jamie Waugh, who served as a proctor for my sociology class at Faulkner University. Words cannot express my heartfelt appreciation to the CrossBridge staff (Johnny Brown, Richard Garguilo, Phyllis Jamison, Greg Miles, and Chris Smith) for "holding down the fort" while I was away. I am additionally grateful to the CrossBridge shepherds and their wives (Bruce and Susan Akin, H.C. and Bonnie Johnson, Gregg and Diana Waycaster, Ken and Chris Smith) for watching over the flock to faithfully--this gave me a tremendous peace of mind. Most of all, I'm gratefully to God for the beauty of His creation, and the special way a sunset over the Gulf of Mexico proclaims His enduring glory.  I am so glad to be back home with my family at CrossBridge. This is the first time in my preaching ministry that I've every been away from my church home for two consecutive Sundays. I simply cannot wait for Wednesday, and Sunday to see my brothers and sisters here. This church is truly a taste of heaven here on earth. I am so grateful that this church let's me minister among it! Be looking for blogs inspired by a week on the Florida coast.
