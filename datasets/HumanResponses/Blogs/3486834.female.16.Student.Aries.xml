      Aloha!! Well uhh this is Asia.. Jennifer.. YaYa (Ariana).. and Heather. Ohk we are just hanging out.. being weird, as usual. Today.. let's see all that happened was that I (Asia) woke up around 1:00.. because the phone was ringing off of the wall! (Heather and Jennifer call TOO early!!) Ohk, well at 2:00 we went to the elks and we got back at my house around 8:00.. then we went over to Paxton's.. again. Played Halo. Pretty cool! Anyways.. Only Jennifer can spend the night, cause her mom is cool. LOL j/k, so I just think that Heather and Yaya's parents are weird.. but the have stupid GOLF in the morning. Party poopers!! Ahaha..So me and Jennifer can just party and have fun without them! So right now, it's 9:30 or something, i think. Paxton just asked me out.. :-/...! I am saying no. Anyways.. next subject. Now I think that Pax is mad at me.. sux.

      Hey. I'm bored.. now this is new. What happened today..? Oh uh, I woke up, got ready.. and I thought I had plans with Jennifer, Arianna, and Heather.. but that didn't work out. We were gunna go to the mall and then see a movie.. so I ended up going with my mom. YAY! So yeah.. we saw Shrek 2!! It was soo fun! Puss in Boots is the biggest stud! Ok.. well uh Paxton and Trey were there, they sat by me and my mom. Through the movie Paxton kept saying 'dirty'.. what a weird-o! J/K, but it was sorta.. not normal.. Oh and another thing is when I got home.. Jennifer totally went off on me thinking that i went to the movies with Pax and Trey.. So that was sorta MESSED UP! But she is kinda PMSing, so I can't blame her, but shhh don't tell anyone. So it's all good between us. Well Jennifer should be over here right now, but her dad is being gay. So I am going to stay home, writing in my blog, since everyone else is busy.. no time for Asia.. :(. Ok well anyways, Michele is moving to California, I will miss her soooooo much, she is soo cool!  Much love to Micha!  I don't think there is anything else.. Hmm I am going swimming tomorrow, so that will be cool, if my mom doesn't go. Just kidding, she's.. uh.. fun.. sometimes, other times she is just .. hmm.. embarassing. Okay, well I guess I better go, you are probably about to die of boredom (however you spell it).. If you want to make me smile, post a comment, but if you don't then that's cool.

( espescially with his shirt off ;-) )today i went to the lake, wasn't to eventful. the pool at the country club opened! i didn't go, but everyone was there so that sucks.  uh well i'm pretty sure that's bout it.. oh and when i was at the lake, i got a stain on my new skirt, i guess i should be used to it. i am so freaking clumsy! sucks for me!

      this is my first time using this blog thing.  it's pretty cool!  ok well it is summer, no more school.. and no more mr. groves!! YAY! he is the biggest perverted fag teacher i know. sorry if that didn't make sense.  well anyways, so far summer has been very interesting.  hung out with jennifer.. went to a party, went to paxton's house a couple of times. when we were walking back to my house, he attacked me with water balloons, it wasn't too cool! oh and i cuddled with dylan ;) he is really hot! but i think one of my friends likes him. oh well!  today i got my report card, I DID GOOD! but it's gay cause i didn't even make honor role when i had A's in everything. i guess i am smarter then i thought!  lol.. not really. uhh what else..  i saw mean girls. it was good, but there were no hot guys there(at the movies) :( then when i got home paxton was being an ass! he got all pissed at me for no reason, and then we just argued forever. so i guess i am mad at him,.. most of it is blamed on me PMSing.. you didn't need to know that, but i might as well warn you! lol.. cause i am dangerous right now! oh and about my report card, i made an A on my exam in spanish!! go me!! i am not to good in that class.. they call me 'white' or something *shrugs shoulders* it's not like they are lying or anything!

      I am soooo bored.. I want to do something badly.. I can't do anything with Amanda tomorrow cause I have lunch with my grandmother and then my mom wants to go shopping.. again *sighs*.. i am almost sick of shopping.. That NEVER happens! Emily can't do anything cause she has an Art Camp or something. How lame can that get. I hope it's not the one with Ms. Flynn... accually to tell you the truth.. when I did that Art Camp w/ her I had a pretty good time.. Only because I got to help out with the kindergardeners and we got to swim a lot.. hehe.. Just cause I was special. Farrin is still out of town.. I think.. I still haven't seen her.. :(.. she is like the coolEST! I would go skating like I used to.. but I forgot my skates again.. I mean I am so bored that I thought about reading a book.. but it figures.. I forgot a book, too. Man life sucks! With all of this time doing nothing, I just think about the crappy things in life.. Gets pretty depressing. Oh and I didn't have nightmares last night.. YAY! I had a cool dream, but I don't have to tell you about that. It was just really really cool. lol. I am gunna go try to find something to occupy all of this useless time I have..

      These past few days have been pretty busy.. well not really. I have goine to a mall 3 days in a row. FFFUN! Except it gets old when the guys say "How you doin' ma??" haha.. I just walk  away.. I still miss everyone. I need to get Paxton a gift for his birthday while I am out of town. Everyone is saying that I'm missing a lot. Emily got like a a foot cut off of her hair.. That's like.. WOAH! But it is just to her shoulders or something. Amanda wanted me to do something with her Wednesday. She said that we coiuld go surfing or something!! WOOHOO! That would be so cool! I am soo bored right now.. My mother is getting on my nerves.. She won't stop talking about moving.. I do NOT want to move! And she started asking me what college I wanted to go to. She says that I should go somewhere in Europe. Hah.. yeah right. And this stupid GAP thingy. I really did not want to be in GAP! I told my mom and everything, but she said that she was gunna make me. Mrs. Burns even told the parents not to force the child. I feel some forcing going on.. *rolls eyes*..  I need someone to make me laugh or something. I was soo grossed out at dinner.. I don't know how the subject came up but everyone started talking about women getting their tubes tied.. i mean how nasty is that. me and gary had to put our foot or feet down.. so we tried to chane the subject.. i already have enough nightmares. It's not as if gage gave me enough.. All I did was start talking about marrying allen iverson.. and then he said that he will be all wrinkly and take viagra.. EWW! That's just not something that I wanted to think about.

      Dodgeball IS the BEST movie EVER!! I was cracking up during the whole movie. "I know you. You know you. You know that I know that you know you." Funny.. This past week has been.. fun. I went to my aunt's lakehouse over the weekend. I got like and awesome tan. Gary didn't bring his boat tho. So we were stuck with a stupid sail boat. I started to think possitive and then there was no wind.. How lame is that. Emily was scared at the lakehouse cause my mom told us that Shelley's (my aunt) grandfater died in one of the beds we were sleeping in. And she wouldn't tell us which one it was. (we faught over who was gunna sleep on the top bunk, cause emily said that old guys don't sleep on the top bunk. lol) Then I told my aunt the story that my mom told me and Shelley said that it totally wasn't true. Her grandfather died in the BATHTUB, while taking a bath, if you didn't already guess that. Like that was even better.. So I had quite an experience up at the lake.  Then I don't really remember doing anything else other than that and going to the mall... yeah my life is SO exciting!!! *sighs* Today I woke up SUPER early. It was like 9 or something. So that was pretty lame. We were gunna go up to World Market to get something for my granddad for Father's Day. It would've worked out, if my mom didn't lose one of her credit cards. And she didn't bring her checkbook. AND she didn't have any cash on her. Funny how that happens. After stressing over all of that, we went to the Lexus dealership.. we were accually on time. That's a first.. My mom's car is like messing up. Bummer. Now we have a loner car for a couple of days. YAY! I can't wait to drive it ;). Around 11, we went to my Grandad's restaurant for lunch. Yummmay! I washed dishes behind the bar. No one paid me either. I should get extra for just being so cute behind the bar =D. We finally headed home around 3. On the way home, I found myself singing Papa Roach with my mom. LOL. I feel as if we bonded somehow... This weekend is the Warp or Wharp or something Tour. Yellowcard, Coheed and Cambria, The Story of the Year, and like a dozen other bands are gunna be in it. That makes me mad.. cause I didn't get tickets.. NOT fair. I think they are sold out.. but who knows.. I am gunna call around. I may know some people that know some people that are friends with people that can get me tickets. i am just that special! hehe.   I wonder where Jennifer is..*Jennifer if you are out there, CALL ME* I haven't talked to her since Felisha was over at her house. And Heather said that she hasn't talked to her in 4 days or something. WOAH! I miss her.. *tear* I miss everyone. Especially this one special person that I miss the most. I have no idea where that came from. I am getting so bored lately that I start to MISS school. Something is seriously wrong with me now..   Jessica S. sent me the longest e-mail in the world, so I guess I should reply.. All of you out there should e-mail her. She said that I am the only one that has been e-mailing her back.. how sad. But she told me a really fun story about what happened to Kelsey at mission camp.. haha. It just made my day. bye

      I'm here at Emily's again, and I am REALLY sleepy.. we had a pretty busy day. I went to bed last night around 3 or 4.. and then I woke up a lil after noon.. my mom woke me up cause I had to call Emily. Then I went over to her house.... we went SHOPPING!! HORRAY! I got something for Robbey A. at Urban Outfitters.. that's a tyte store. They were these "smart" pencils.. lol.. they are cool.. Then I got a frappacinuo at Startbucks. It was gooooddd. Haha I got some undies at Victoria's Secret and then some Bazooka Bubble Gum at Virgin Records. Haha so now I am broker than BROKE!! So is Emily, and she owes me $3!! She just HAD to get this purse for GAP.. whatever. Just because I am such a good friend!! Plus she used her giftcard ($20).. and the purse was $22.99. Anyways.. when we got back we just hung out around the house for a lil while. And then we went swimming.. it was fun. We wrapped out goggles around our feet and then we tried to swim. It was difficult and FUN!! After we got out and took a shower, we begged Emily's dad to take us to TCBY. He said NO!! :'(. So we made our own sundaes.. YAY!! ok well I am gunna go.. later.

      Emily is the coolest EVER!! Haha.. well yeah I am at her house right now, and we are having the time of our lives.. yeah!! Ok well today.. we hung out, OMFG- we went to a thrift store with her sis. By the way her sister Laura got a '92 Volvo, it was soo hot. Ok anyways.. at the thrift store Emily got this really cute boy's shirt that says '....Tots... Gymnastics' or something like that. It was only 49 cents!! lol. I got this boy's NBA shirt and a white belt. It only cost me $3! hah! So that was an experience. Then we went swimming...! fun! So yeah now we are just being weird as usual. Well it is mostly Emily being weird. She made up a new word. ***LIZNOVE!!*** umm yeah it's a pimp word for love. Tomorrow we are gunna hang out until we start getting on ea/other's nerves.. haha. So I am probably gunna stay here for a few weeks.. i hope! This is like my 2nd home, it's cool. Cause like I LOVE wearing her clothes.. lol!! I think she doesn't mind. K well I miss everyone!! *blows kiss* BYE!! Emily says hey too! I mean bye.. whatever

      I think today is Monday, well at least I hope it is. This summer is moving pretty slow. Today I accually woke up at 9 something. I am very proud of myself... heh. Later my mom and I are going to look at some cars.. she wants to sell hers, and get a BWM.. maybe. That would be cool, i guess. And then I might do something with Emily, at least I hope so. So if I see her then I need to get a birthday present for her.. hmm. OMG Paxton told me that his dog died and her told Jennifer that Mr. Fuentes' snake died. He is probably lying. I should call Mr. Fuentes and tell him that Paxton killed his snake.. nahh.. but that would be pretty funny. I'm still trying to fix my sunt's MSN, I hope it works.. cause I can't call everyone. It's 11:30 so I am gunna try to occupy myself somehow. Sorry if I spelt that wrong. hah. later.     urlLink

      I'm at my aunts house.. horray. I think i spelt that wrong.. oh well. And so we left around 4:oo or something.. drove for a lonnnngg time and then we got to my aunt's house around 1:00 in the morning. Thank god we got there cause I needed some sleep. It was the first time I slept since Monday... I slept hard, but then I woke up at like 7:00 am. So I only got a few hours of sleep, but it was better than nothing... I haven't seen any of my old friends yet, at least I have called them. hah. I just got off of the phone with Emily.. We probably won't do anything until Monday or something cause Amanda is about to go out of town to California for two weeks... so you know they have to hang out with eachother before she leaves.. Hahah and I am not invited. I understand, cause Amanda hates me. I think today is Friday, but I am not too sure. That means that Yaya's and Lauren's birthday was yesterday. I wish I could've been in town for Yaya's birthday *sighs*. My aunt's MSN isn't working, and none of my family has AIM... *tear* lol. So like if you are reading this you should e-mail me. My mom said that the only chance of me making money is working at my granddad's restaurant. I had planned on her saying that. The only problem is that i would have to stay with him to go to work with him every morning.. ugh.. So I am not sure if I am going to make any money this summer.. I may just try to think of something else later. OMFG before I went out of town I wrote a poem.. haha yeah it was cool. But the poem is so totally lame. I want to learn how to play guitar.. that would be tyte (sorry I don't quite know where that came from). It would give me something to do, cause I am really really REALLY bored. I think Paxton and Trevor are mad at me.. lol.. I think it was Wednesday when I was talking to them on MSN.. and I ask them what they are doing.. They go 'We are taking turns making out with ur mom'.. haha so I said 'omg guys my mom just read what you wrote.. i g2g i am in so much trouble' haha so I got back on a few minutes later and they were all worried that they were gunna get in trouble and I told them I was joking and they called me gay. lol.. so yeah. hehe oops. I miss everyone soo much and I can't wait til I come home, that will be the day. My mom is planning on staying out of town for a month. This is gunna suck BIG ones.....! I have no clue what she plans on doing for that long. Oh yeah and we are gunna move into another house. Ask if you want to know the story. It's really sad... but I dunno, it may be tyte moving into another place, even tho I like our house. hmm.. too bad. I'm gunna go to Blockbusters. *kiss*

      Today has been... blah. ha. I woke up around 3 or something. I stayed up all night drawing.. weird. I found my old sketch book... I'm not that bad of a drawer, but i haven't done it in a while. So I stayed up until about 5:30 a.m. doing that. So then I just hung out til about 7.. then I had to pack to go out of town.. We are going everywhere.. California, Las Vegas.. and somewhere WAY south. Ugh.. well it took me forever to pack, since I don't really know when I am comming home. Sometime in July.. maybe sooner, if I can beg my mom to go home. It will be nice to see all of my old friends. I miss them a lot. I lost almost everyones number tho.. hmm, sux. Last time I went out of town, I spent 3 nights at Emily's house.. haha it was tyte. Haha.. that's when I called Amanda and Sophie fags.. oops. I think they still hate me for that. I forgot why I called them that tho. Well I feel bad for doing it.. So sorry and yeah :(.. I hope I'm not leaving tomorrow. Cause I wanted to see Shrek 2 again, since I didn't get to see it today. If we don't leave tomorrow, or eh today.. then we are leaving thursday. I don't want to.. I am going to miss everyone SOOOOOO much. I love you guys!! I will hopefully get to write in my blog at my aunts house or something. And I will try to call everyone, if I get a chance..  I watched game 2 of the playoffs. Damnit the Lakers won. posers. They went into overtime cause Kobe had to make a 3 pointer in the last 10 seconds or something. That makes me so mad. gah. Now i'm pissed thinking about the Lakers beating the Pistons...  Ok.. what else. .. HAPPY BIRTHDAY URIAH! lol. Two more days til yaya's birthday. Aw crap, I have to get her something before I leave. I still don't know what to get her.. hmm.. maybe she will like money. Everyone likes that. I will have to ask my mom for more money.. OMG today my mom told me that I had a lot of money somewhere in the house.. so I looked EVERYWHERE.. she wouldn't tell me where it was, cause she said it would be like a treasure hunt. how gay. well i found it.. it was 5 dollars, in gold coins.. even worse. So now.. my summer balance is at $8.71.. wow!!  that's sad.. I hope to get 500 dollars of my own by the end of this year... to buy something.  What should I buy....? Wow what could I get with 500 dollars.. I'm gunna have to think about that.    Haha I was so bored last night that I wrote a story. It's lame so yeah. Gahh I am bored. And tired. But I am going to stay up.. again. It's not like I am going to do anything til around 7 tomorrow so yeah. "A Favor House Atlantic" is a really cool song.. I am probably the only one that likes it tho. ha. Another tyte song is "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows".. I have no clue why I like it, but I thought you may want to know that it is a good one. Ok, I hope you have learned something. God bless.

      Hey nothing really happened today. I feel better now.. I talked on the phone.. a lot!! And then I had the worst nose bleed ever. It sucked :(. I am fine tho. Then I passed out on the couch for about two hours. I am still tired. I didn't get any sleep last night. Sucks. So most of my day was spent 'bonding' with my family. It wasn't too bad... i guess. I think I may like someone, but i am not too sure. I can't tell you who it is tho.. hah. So don't beg for me to tell you, cause it's not gunna happen!! I may go and see Shrek 2 again tomorrow.. hopefully. That is the best movie ever. But Shrek and Pheona should've stayed pretty, in my opinion. Cause I wouldn't like life too much if I was scaring ppl away. Well I hope that never happens to me, but you never know. I can't wait until I start cheering again. I miss it a lot... I'm a lil scared right now, I'm watching Ghost Ship, like alone. Here I go again, damn I'm lame. I need to make up a word... hmm.. *10 minutes later*.. No luck! Darn.. help me out here, plz. Ok well I am going to go to bed, I'm tired and I want to wake up early. peace.

      Trevor is like the coolest. He sent me and some other ppl an e-mail saying that he was sorry for all of the bad stuff that he has done and how he has acted. Me and him fought.. like a lot, but I am soooooooo happy that he did that. I think he made a lot of ppl happy. So yeah, he was really cool for doing that.  Cayli Perry's 10 year old cuz told me that Cayli doesn't like me.. I am mean to her or something. Thats gay cause like I don't even know her. That just sorta makes me mad, when ppl just hate me for no reason,  they say it's cause I am a prep. wtf... I am one, why are preps so bad?? LOL. Anyways. Dude I am so freaking lame, this is my 3rd time writing in this blog.. today. whatever. I am still not at the point of writing a story or reading a book.  Well reading a book well help me get to sleep. I should try to learn something. nahh. I will stick to the magazines.. hehe. I am getting lamer and lamer each minute. Is lamer a word?? I think it is more lame.. hmm.. I should look that up.   haha lamer is a word.. lam·er, lam·est 1. Disabled so that movement, especially walking, is difficult or impossible: Lame from the accident, he walked with a cane. A lame wing kept the bird from flying. 2. Marked by pain or rigidness: a lame back. 3. Weak and ineffectual; unsatisfactory: a lame attempt to apologize; lame excuses for not arriving on time.  i really did not understand that..  i think i am definition 3. coooolll.. lol perfecterest is like the coolest word ever. so is duuuude and icky! lol. i really should go. i am getting to excited thinking of words. how weird.

      I have been thinking.. If someone doesn't want to be a chicken, or a duck, then why the heck would they want to shake their butt.. that had been haunting me for a while. I know it may sound stupid, but it has already wasted 15 minutes of my life.. I need to find something to do. Maybe I should write a book. Hmm, but what would I write about....? Maybe I could write a book about my life.. or uhh.. Ok, forget that. I could... read.. something. nahhh.. OMG I just found out that Ronald Reagan (however you spell it) passed away. I can't believe it. :'(... He did a lot for this country.. Even tho i am not too sure what those things were. But he will be missed.  Now back to what I should do.. Oh and I need money, other than my mom's. Maybe I should get a job.. something that makes a lot of money.. fast. This may be more difficult than I thought. I may work the rest of this summer out at my graddad's restaurant. I have done that before.. when I was in 2nd grade. Wow, this may work out. ($$$) I still haven't thought of anything to do. I don't want to get out cause I still don't feel good and I don't think my mom would let me go anywhere. I guess I will just watch game 1 of the finals. It's the Pistons and Lakers. All I have say is.. Lakers suck big ones. So I guess I am not going for either teams.. but I want the Pistons to beat the Lakers. Oh crap.. I guess I am going for the Pistons... Ariana's birthday is in 4 days, so is Laurens.. And Uriah's birthday is Tuesday. Too many birthdays. I have written a lot. Woah and it has spent some of my time. This is brillant! lol

      Just another Sunday.... boringgg. It's Emily's birthday!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMILY!! I'm not going to do anything today. I wanted to make plans, but I dunno. I'm still not feeling good. It may just be allergies or something. If it is allergies than this is the worst I have ever had. I woke up really late today. I think it was after 2. I went to bed at 4 or something... I couldn't sleep, I never can during summer. I really need to get out.. soon. I'm going crazy not doing something, and schools out. This is lame!! lol

      It's Saturday.. I don't feel good. All I did today was go and see Harry Potter.. it was good. But I am not the biggest Harry Potter fan. I wanted to go to the carnival again, but my mom was being gay. She's on the rags tho. Again, it sucks for me!  I'm trying to look for some pics of me on glamour shots. We got pictures taken there a long time ago.. I still want to see them. They are considered sacred to my mom, so I am not aloud to touch the real pictures. I want to have some on my computer.. I hope it works. I sorta wish that I went out of town today, cause it was Emily's birthday party. I really wanted to see all of my old friends. It sux that it didn't work out. So now I think we are leaving next saturday or this wednesday. it hasn't been made too clear to me.  I am still trying to figure out how i can add links and pictures to my blog. Jon wants me to go to church with Jennifer.. I have no clue why.. I should get back to doing nothing. Later

      Nothing really has happened to me lately. Uhh I went to the carnival. Now I feel sick from riding each ride almost 3 times. I guess you could say it was fun. It was just me and Jennifer. We saw uhh.. Jaze, Jon, Santi, and Richard there. That's about it. hah I ran out of tickets really fast, so I went up to some ppl that I sorta knew and this one dude gave me a lot of tickets... it was pretty cool. My throat hurts bad from screaming on the rides so much. We were up there for about 3 or 4 hours. It got old really fast! I have a bad headache right now, it sucks. I should go to bed.. goodnight!

      Since school is out, I thought I may make fun of it. I found this on bitoffun.com.. It's really tyte..!!! Here is a cool Little Johny story...  Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question, "Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?" "None," replied Johnny, "cause the rest would fly away." "Well, the answer is four," said the teacher, "but I like the way you're thinking."   Little Johnny says, "I have a question for you. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one was licking her cone, the second was biting her cone and the third was sucking her cone, which one is married?"   "Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone."   "No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you're thinking."  HAHA here's another one....  It was the final examination for an introductory English course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out new students, having over 700 students in the class!   The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail. 1/2 hour into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet.   "You're not going to have time to finish this," the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet.   "Yes I will," replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in. All except the late student, who continued writing. 1/2 hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there.   "No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late." The student looked incredulous and angry.   "Do you know WHO I am?"   "No, as a matter of fact I don't," replied the professor with an air of sarcasm in his voice.   "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" the student asked again.   "No, and I don't care." replied the professor with an air of superiority.   "Good," replied the student, who quickly lifted the stack of completed exams, stuffed his in the middle, and walked out of the room

      yesterday i went over to kelsey's! we just hung out for a while. then laura came over. so i got to meet her.. she is like the coolest! we we all went over to kelsey's aunt's house to swim. it was like dark and cold tho. haha. omg, we all wanted to scare kelsey's next door neighbor, by like banging on her door and window. well we banged on her windows a couple of times. she like caught laura and kelsey, but not me. so i just told them to pretend i wasn't there. so while they were talking to the neighbor, i went to one of the back doors and started banging on it as hard as i could. haha. she was SO freaked out. bad thing was that she got her baseball bat and ran outside. i was about to piss my pants i was so scared. i had to hide behind a house that was supossed to be haunted.. the neighbor (mary) wouldn't let kelsey or laura leave cause she was so scared, and she wanted to call the police. i ended up staying behind the house for ovre 40 minutes.i was so relieved when we got back @ kelsey's. after we calmed down a lil we watched american wedding and then thirteen. the movie thirteen creeps me out.. badly. god 7th graders get into too much trouble.. lol. kelsey fell asleep on the couch around 2. so me n laura dressed up like drag queens and took pic w/ her cell. I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE, NOT TO PLAY WITH FIRE!! i did, and i burnt myself bad.lol. it hurt.. badly! then i bruised my heel somehow, and got a thorn stuck in my foot. more pain. me and laura didn't go to sleep at all. we woke kelsey up around 5. the sun was almost up. so we went outside to try and fall asleep on the trampoline. i didn't work.. haha! around 6 we just took and walked the dogs, sorta. one of the dog's ran of and started attacking a stray kitten. my instincts were to save it.. so i tried to get all of the dogs away,. when i did, the kitten just laid there. we used a shirt to grab it. by the kitten bit me soo hard. i was bleeding pretty badly. we took it to mary's cause she can help the cat.. i felt so bad.. but then the cat bit me again.. i don't think she made it. :'(! after all of that, we all took a 5 hour nap. then went four-wheeling! fun! my mom had to pick me up around 6. we went out o eat. now i am here. bored.. and tired..

YAY! that is, by far, the coolest movie, EVER! i stayed awake really late last night, even tho i was tired. like until 4. then my mom woke me up at 10, cause i had to "pull it together". we went and hung out with my grandad, that's always cool. at about 5, i got to go to the galleria. HORRAY! i am being forced to go to bed.. later.. and it's only 11!

      Got back to my aunt's house from Emily's the day before yesterday.. She went to Austin. I'm sure she's having fun! Yesterday I just hung around the house.. boring.. And today I went to Hurrican Harbor.. so that was really cool, but my face is sunburned, again. It will prolly be gone by tomorrow tho.. I think it's worth it, cause now i have an awesome tan! YAY! I should be home pretty soon.. I think sometime next week.. We didn't get to do all of the things we planned, cause like we have to move, and my family wants to get it over with. I'm a little ready for school. Not like the learning part, but being with everyone. Oh yeah and now Felisha can be in school with all of us!!!!!!! So many cool things happen... like Dylan trying to lick his elbow in Spanish.. and bite his ear in Math class.. That may have been the reason why I wasn't doing good in either of those classes.. Mrs. Johnson had to put me behind Jennifer, and between Andy and Dylan.. how does she expect me to learn..?! And in Mrs. Corona's class, I got a chance to get by everyone.. cause she moved me all the time. At least she didn't icolate me, like Mr. Groves did to me and Santi. He just doesn't like me... and I don't like him. He claims that I talk all the time, but I know that he is still embarrassed over "The World Revolves Around Asia".. I forgot how that started, he said that it revolved around me, and the whole class agreed.. but then he made me feel bad about it.. Uhh.. ok..?

The Crow's got back from Colorado.. so me and Emily hung out with Ryan and Jenny. We messed around on the scootchers.. FUN! It was so freaking hot, so we just jumped in the pool with our clothes on. Only for like 5 minutes tho. Now Emily is in the shower and I am trying to waste some time. I heard that Robbey's birthday was today.. SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROBBEY! Ad Paxton's is comming up.. Still too many birthdays.. I miss everyone.

      Yesterday I did SOMETHING!! I went over to Tommy's and we watched Kill Bill Vol. 1. Now I want to go and kick someone's butt! Well at least kick something. It was a really awesomely awesome movie. Sorry I could not control myself. Now it's 2. I'm about to get ready to go out somewhere.. don't know where yet. I have a feeling that i will be going to the Galleria next week. I haven't gone in a while anyways. Today is Emily's last day of her camp.. so hopefully we can do something. I think Amanda wanted me to do something with her today, but she hasn't called.. I wish I didn't lose everyone's number.. Cause then I wouldn't be bored. My mind just blanked out and I can't think of anything else to say. Bye all you sexy people out there!!

      Just found out today that Pete, my next door neighbor, pasted away Sunday.. :'(. That's really sad.  Jennifer's at camp so now I know why I haven't talked to her. I think it's another mission camp. I don't know what today is.. I think it is Wednesday or Thursday.. My mom said that it's the 1st, but you can never trust her. So that means that 4th of July is comming up.. I don't know what I am gunna do, my family probably has something big planned for everyone.  Gah it's only like 2. I'm going to get out of the house today.. even if it kills me. If only the weather was nice.. It is still really stormy and icky.  Paxton doesn't like the Longhorns.. psh. (He hates them).. Well I guess we are even, cause I hate Texas Tech. hehe. Take that!

      I heard you crying loud All the way across town You've been searching for that someone And it's me out on the prowl As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself Well don't get lonely now And dry your whining eyes I'm just roaming for the moment Sleazing my backyard so don't get so uptight You've been thinking about ditching me  No time to search the world around 'Cause you know where I'll be found When I come around  I heard it all before So don't knock down my door I'm a loser and a user So I don't need no accuser To try and slag me down because I know you're right So go do what you like Make you sure you do it wise You may find out that your self-doubt Means nothing was ever there You can't go forcing something If it's just not right  No time to search the world around 'Cause you know where I'll be found When I come around  No time to search the world around 'Cause you know where I'll be found When I come around Oh when I come around Oh When I come around When I come around  <3
