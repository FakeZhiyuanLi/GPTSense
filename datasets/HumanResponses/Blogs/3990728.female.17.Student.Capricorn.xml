      I might die. For my father want me to call him to give him a clothing sizes. What will happen you may ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will either shop alone and buy me crap I won't want to ever wear, or he will take me with him and he'll go to the stores that sell crap I won't wear. Does anyone else see a problem with this? Why can't he just give me the money and let me go shopping alone at so let's say Torrid, ( urlLink www.torrid.com ), so I'll have stuff I'll actually wear.

Angry Souls arent always  angry, but they cannot easily forgive and hold  grudges. You probably often get in fights with  your friends and family, and its difficult for  you to understand. When someone makes a  mistake, you dont let go easily and hold on to  those memories. Your very stubborn and your  rage is known to everyone. Though you never  actually mean it, you can say mean things in a  fight and go over board. Many people are  sometimes intimidated by your anger. But you  have many redeeming qualities and those are  that you are quite intelligent and smart. You  would make a good businesswoman or lawyer  because you know how to prove your point. You  cherish the ones around you, and appreciate  life, even though you can complain or throw a  tantrum now and then. The good things is, you  keep your emotions very outspoken, and are  normally a very happy person because all your  rage is let on the outside.

      How do you forgive and forget stuff? I never could and still can't see how someone could forgive someone for big things and forget about it. Now somebody steals from you or something I could see forgiving and forgetting... Or at lease forgiving. But I mean bigger stuff. Like my father. I can't forgive him or forget what he's done. Somebody told me I should but I want them to have thier father beat them as bad as he did then tell me to forgive him and forget it. [I don't really want it to happen, I'm just implying who they should speak unless some big trama happened to theirselves.] Oh well.

        Loose 150-170 pounds all together. I currently weight 300 pounds. I hope to loose 10 pounds a month so that by the Great Lakes Medieval Faire [ urlLink http://www.medievalfaire.com ]&nbsp;for 2005 I'll be skinnier.  Admit to my crush that I like him. Hopefully before he might ever leave.  Get my license. Even though I'm terrified of driving.  Get into a college. I want to go to Kent State for secondary education.  Get published. I still need to finish my story though.  Work on my acting skills &amp; medieval speak.

       I had the weirdest dream. I don't remember it all but I remember being at my father house with my sisters. His basements looked identical to my sister's friend Carrie Ann's basement and we ere in it. I was only and saw Cory Z  was on. I looked and saw him in a chat room. He never chats. I really wanted to go to the room but didn't want him to see me. That's about all with that dream.   Then I don't remember everything but I did get to meet the young Brandon from Bardic Winds at a faire.

       I have no life. I'm absolutely bored.   Okay so I started a thing calle Mission 135. It's a goal of mine to loose 135 pounds. Problem is, no support/help/anything. No money to buy things we don't have but should. So I'm screwed in the loosing weight part.

       It was in 7th grade. He just started 6th grade and was my best friend Lisa's cousin. Willie. Ah. My only relationship.   It starts on Valentine's Day. We rode the same bus home. It was a quiet trip which I found a little strange. As me and my sister, (a 10th grader), got off the bus, Willie handed me a candy wrapper. I opened it as I walked to our house and read it. Then my sister read it. She runs in to call and tell her friend about it. For on it he asked me out. How sweet of him. We went for a while. Lost contact. Remet. And in February were back together. Being young nothing much happened. But I wish I had never broke it off. Now I wonder what would of happened.   It's sad.

       Issues out my *ss. Let us list.   *School. It's my senior year and I should feel something. Joy. Sadness. Anything. But I don't. It's just another year to me.   *Further schooling. I have no clue what I've going to do. I want to go to college and get a good paying job but how do you do without knowing what you want to do. That's my problem. I have no clue what I want to do. I don't find myself good at anything really.  *The Great Lakes Medieval Faire. Very few thing can make me happy. The faire makes me happy and now it's over. I might cry.  :'(    *Family. I swear if it weren't for my little sisters, I'd never see my father. What an *ss. We barrowed his van Sunday to go to the Faire's last day and the faire was like from 10-7 or a little after and he got p*ssed off for us coming home late. AFTER I HAD TOLD HIM WE'D BE ALL DAY! But no! The dumb *ss can't ever be wrong. Or else his f*cking world would crumble. I hope to God he f*cking wakes up and realizes he needs some help. Then he makes me feel like sh*t. He b*tched my older sister for the being gone all day. I stick up for her and she can't even get the balls the fight back and tell him he's wrong. She's a wimp, he's a drunken ignorant *sshole! Then here he goes later that night. I'm p*ssed at him. When we fought he said I was a pyscho all because I was brave enough to call him out! Back to later that night, he comes in and gives my sister money before she leaves for college again. He tries to get me, I think $15 and I tell him straight up that I don't want his money and he asked me if I was mad at him! What the f*ck! Of course you stupid *ss wipe! now he thinks we haveno problems and everything is back to the way it was before. Maybe he'd see the truth if he was a drunk and if he went to some anger management classes.   *Family... again. And once more the problem is him. My father decided to go school clothes shopping. Thanks to him, I have no school clothes. For he went and bought stuff off of   urlLink  blair.com    and the stuff comes in and looks worse then what it did on the site, not that it looked good on the site to start with. I mean, this ugly stuff that you'd see old people in their 70s or 80s wearing to bingo. I wear stuff from Torrid, (  urlLink  Torrid.com    ). Now I have nothing to wear to school. Isn't that great! Thanks dad!   *I do not want to go to work tomarrow. I feel like crap and my emothions are f*cked up at the moment.    God I need help.

      Not feeling to good. I want to quit my job so bad. I can't stand one of the employees, Brianne. Having the biggest problems with her. She's such a bitch. I was working drive thru packing and she was up front. The guy running drive thru, (my work buddy Brandon), was out smoking and she had a up front one customer that she was packing an order for then two people waiting for their order to be taken. I was busy trying to pack for people waiting out side for food. She calls her someone to ring up the next order, she would collect on it so I take a quick break to ring them up then I rush back to drive thru to finish packing. Then she starts bitching cuz I rang the order and didn't pack it! HELLO! 01)She never said she needed someone to pack it. After all there wasn't many people up front. 02)It wasn't my job to even be up there. 03)I had people waiting for food too. She wasn't the only one working. God I have so many problems and the ones at work usually start with her. Work isn't my only problems. One is also my father. Surprise surprise. He went school clothes shopping without me, the clothes are ugly, and I feel rude saying they are to him. I have no clue what to do.
