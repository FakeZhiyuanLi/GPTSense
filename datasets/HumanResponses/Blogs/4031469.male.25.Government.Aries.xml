      Weather: Drizzling again at night  Mood: Feeling outspoken today.   Morning was quite rush for me. Need to rush for my photoshoot. Wow. So Glam. Correct me, but I must admit its Instant Photo shoot. Not i-weekly or Asian Wall Street Journal.  Some people says I am sentimental. Ouch punch! Hey, but I am sentimental. Sometimes, just by walking past a mall makes me think lot. My friend and I had sat there many years ago. Just by seeing Far East Plaza with that Taiwan wannabe snack stall at B1 makes me recall the tough days I had in Republic of China for 3 weeks for army training.  Its not too good to be sentimental. True, dont be heartless, but not sentimental.   After photoshoot, rushed home (meixia there?) to do NUS bidding.  &nbsp; Today is the closing bid time for NUS modules selection.   There are 1117 points. Saw that not many people opting  Calculas . So, put 1 pt. Shoud be able to secure it.  The hot modules are  Probability  as well as  Economics.     &nbsp; Had&nbsp;allocated 60% of points to Economics.   The results will be out at 2300 hrs. Wish me luck.  Called Jeff earlier. He was on his way to Fairyland in Reality concerto in NTU.   Dont know how is it. Waiting for his call later.  Its Wed Mambo night tomorrow. Went there last week.   What can I rebuke ? No critique required . The $20/pax crowd explains it all. Now , I wonder whether should I take a Bachelor Degree in Nightlife Management (Hons).  Sign an Europa Scholarship ?   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Weather: Gloomy with slight drizzle . Night was breezy throughout the islands.  Mood: Generally good, if not for my bad throat and high body temp  The day is fast with many things in a jiffy in just a day.  I woke up again feeling very sick, and need to rush to the bathroom to spit out the phelmgh that is doing its normal accumulation work in my air passage way. 'Nuff said!  Went to Jeff friendster and saw that he had posted my personal story into his blogspot (with my knowledge of course)  Sometimes, just felt that this friend of 9 years really know me a lot, more than myself.  In the afternoon, wanted to go for a hair maintanance work. But, lazziness got the better of me.   My hair needs regular body upkeep to keep up with my "afro" image. Afterall, we are only young for once. Look at our paraents at home .  Dinnertime is sumptous. Went to Suntec Kuali Asian Kitchen for a feast. Lai Yee gave me a treat. Hmm, a bit pai sei. But, sealed with heartfelt appreciation.   The food there is not bad. We had 2 claypots of seafood broth with a generous helping of handpicked seafood we chose from the ice tray.  Of course,prawns and "tua tow" are on my platter.  There were 14 kinds of cakes. Mousse cakes, Gelare , Kueh-lapis, Durian cake (which I abstained due to my sore throat) and many more.   We played with Rojak. We left out Maki . It looks wierd, not appetising enough.  All that for a price of Sing$16.80. (limited time only)  I got back. Mother chided me.   I forgot to bring my medicine out. But afterall, its all for my good. Thanks Niang !  Playing Ann Sally's Moon Dance (Track : I wish you love) while spell-typing this memoir of my day.  What else can explain this pleasure in life ?   Only I know. I am sitting comfortably in my workstation, sipping a cup of Manuka honey, enjoying the cold breeze tonight (2357 hrs) and mesmerised by the mellows of Ann Sally.  Beat me to it .  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Its the early hours of Mon morning.   I just stepped out of yesterday.  Weather: Gloomy with slight drizzle  My Mood: Dreamy  My Health: Down with Fever with a tinge of sore throat  &nbsp; I woke up in Sun morning feeling cold and tired. The first swallow of saliva threw me back with excruciating pain as I was greeted with sore throat.  I was down with fever.  I spent my morning playing Cai Qin's Golden Voice Vol. 1 in 24-bit digital mastering. Needless to say, luv it !  I had congee for my lunch. My ma said its best for sick people like me. Oh yea, I always have a weak tolerance for congee. Hmm.. unless its the Chinatown purchased one, the mixed pork organ congee. You may find it awful, but I find it awesome.  Went out with Jeff. We went to Orchard and I ate at StarHub Centre. Had Fish soup. You must be wondering.. why is Kenneth always mingling around FOOD ?  Beats Me ?   Its late now.   Gotta wake up early tomorrow.   Zzzzz.   Before I forget, need to take my medicine. Grown up already, must learn to take care of myself.  After all, those hours spent on push-ups, crunches and chin-ups at home does make me feel healthier, if not for the sudden conquest of fever.   Now hugging my little bear to bed.  Monday, here I come   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well, what can I say about such a good date?  I decided to write today beacause this evenign at 0950 hrs, satay sellers, handcapped swimmers, former swimmer champ turned mentor  Ang Peng Siong and what you have, will be gracing the PM swearing in event held at Istana.  MediaCorp will be stationing their news correspondents , lighting and sound man there .  "THE CHOICE" , a live brodcasting vehicle that sewrves as a mobile Master COntrol Room has already stationed there since Tues afternnon.  People are busying putting  potted plants aroudn the stage to give the ambience a final touching up.  In just less then 5 hrs, Hsin Loong, the descent of Kwan Yew will be announced the next heir.  He will be steering the wheels of Singapore govt and making quite a lot of financial and economic reviews. Since he is the PM now (or a few hrs later), he will have more say than when he was still a finance minister.  I really hope to see my Singapore Idol - Mdm Ho Ching (the newly crowned Mrs Prime Minister) in the ceremony.  If you are able to se this blog on time, be sure to turn in to ChannelNewsAsia by 1950 hrs.  A moment of history, a tale of 2 leaders.  Thank you Chok Tong. Thank you for your service. You are a born leader.  Thank you Kwan Yew. Thank you for creating a smooth path for Singaporean. You are the Father of Singapore  Thank you Ho Ching. Thank you for being such a gracious lady to Hsien Loong.  With that, lets bottoms up to a new cabinet.  More employment opportunities... married women given 6 months maternity leave, greater CPF contribution by employers, more such Free Trade agreements to promote Singapore to the other parts of the globe, more Anti-terror plans...

      A Wed .  Met up exceptionally late and continue to scout.  Had to get readsy fast as will be meeting Qiang this afternoon. We chatted in the morning and it was of an impulse that I recommended to watch a movie by M. Night Shayamalan.  This was the Indian guy , born in India, raised in States, who got everyone talkign about "I saw dead people".  He was also the same culprit who stole your $8.50 when you watched The Unbreakable starring Bruce Willis.  The much hyped movie SIGNS was also directed by him, to the much disappointment of his friends, who still ardously worshipped him due to his former success in The Sixth Sense.  I was also one of the population who worshipped him sheepishly.  We watched The Village yesterday at 1600 hrs.  Bought juices and fries. Sprinted to Cathay Orchard Hall 3 (G11, G12) . We were almost facing the fate of being late.  I WAS DISGUSTED.  Shayamalan regarded the world as imbeciles. We wee treated top what was known as trash.  The movie developed well, with an opening of a grp of villagers mourning for a dead communer.  The twist shouldn't be there. It was redundant.  I wanted to give Ong Sor Fern (ST movie critic) 4 slaps for giving this movie 4 Stars. If she gave 5 stars, you will know how many slaps she will get from me.  Met Jeff later in the evening together with Qiang.  We went to ZOUK Mambo night.  We boozed and danced till 0400 hrs in the cool early morning.  I shampooed my hair , wash my body and read a good book before I slept.  A day to spend my Wed? It could be bettre, if not for The Village.  Do your friends a favour. Tell them to give it a miss.  Unless, you are part of the M. Night Shayamaln Charity Foundation .

      Its raining heavily last night. The weather is wet and moist.  Its Tues. Times just flies. Saw Weiqiang's blog too.  Thks for writing to me Qiang.  Yeah, he went to Fortunate Restauarant, the now dysfunct Yum Cha Restaurant at TPY.  Well, lets place our bet and see how long can this Fortunate Rest sustain ? Of course, with the continous support of Qiang's family, they shouldnt.  I went to have my dinner at Singa Inn East Coast Kelong . Its a chinese seafood steamboat.  There are lots of LIVE prawns and Tang Or vege. The prawns are still struggling for survivl the moment I put them into the hotpot.  Its cruel, but sumptous.  I had crab claws, crab roe, LIVE prawns scooped from the fiah tank coated with algae, Tang Or, shellfish which I should take in small amount since I am allergic to them et cetra.  The dinner ended with a bowful of Almond Jelly and Kwai Lin Gao.  Its supposed to detox all those sinful food I taken. Of course, hope it also detoxify the atrocous act thtat I committed by putting the LIVE jumping prawns into the hot pot. But ,i did helped to shortened their suffering by pushing the prawns ith my laddle into the hot boiling soup so that they will die instantly .  God forbids.  Anyway, will be meeting Qiang, Guowei, Iver and Colin tomorrow.  Looking forward to this rendezvous. Hopefully we can have a cuppa in Secret Gardens. If you haven't been there, its not a metaphor but really a drinking place with registered under the name Secret Garden. Its near the dysfunct Nanyanf Academy of Fine Arts near Middle Rd.  Visit them. Nice ambience with inexpensive drinks.  Good place to chill out though @
