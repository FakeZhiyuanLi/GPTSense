      Hey, Xplain This!  Who came up with the kooky scoring system for tennis, and how did they succeed in convincing everyone else that 1-2-3-4 was a bad idea for keeping score in a game?  I mean, 15-love, 15-all, 40-30 etc.  It makes no sense.  What gives?  Do a post and give me your best theory.  Your readers want to know!

        As you all have probably been told, Santa Claus is not real.  However, Santa is a figure of great respect in the eyes of children all over the world.  So many children believe tales of flying reindeer and little toy-making elves.  As these children grow older, however, they begin to see that this "Santa" can not be physically possible.  They realize that the Santa they have always believed in breaks too many laws of physics to be real.  But... What if I told you that there is a way that Santa could be real.  You would most likely think I was crazy, but listen as I tell you my theory on "Santa Claus"...  Though children have been deceived by some of the stories told about Santa, not all of them are lies.  Let's start with Santa himself.  We all know that it is impossible for one man to visit all the homes of every child around the world in one night, that is why I believe that Santa in not a "one man job".  I believe that there is a top secret organization called Santa Claus United, that is home to hundreds of overweight, white haired, men, who are full of good cheer.  Each Santa is in charged of a different district around the world, and by dividing the world into small manageable sections, Santa Claus United is able to cover the homes of all the children in the world.  The next objection some one might have to my argument, is that a corporation as big as Santa Claus United could not possibly exist without the knowledge of many other people.  This objection brings me to my next point: Where is Santa Claus United based?  One of the legends about Santa is that his work shop is housed in the north pole.  This is also true about Santa Claus United's home base.  However, the SCU (Santa Claus United) home base not just sitting in the middle of the polar icecap, because if that were true, some one would have found them by now.  No, instead of being right out in the open, SCU is buried under the north pole and it's headquarters are made up of thousands of intracate tunnel ways and caves that were made thousands of years ago by the first members of SCU.  In these caves and tunnels, the many Mrs. Clauses, answer phones and organize the shipping of all the toys.  These toys, however, are not, infact, made by elves but are bought from huge toy corporations such as Toy's R Us, Tyco RC, Lego, Barbie, Bratz, and many other toy stores and manufacturers.  The money for these toys is earned through donations to fake "front" companies run by the SCU.  Some of these companies include, the United Way, the Red Cross, and Ronald McDonald House Charities.  However, not all of the money donated to these companies goes to the SCU, a portion is kept and given to needy people to help keep these companies out of suspicion.  Some one might say that it is impossible for Santa to get inside peoples houses to leave presents, but all of SCU's Santas are trained experts in locksmithing and breaking and entering.  Some one might also say that they have stayed up all night and no Santa has come to their house.  The SCU has state of the art surcvallence systems that watch the houses and if anyone is trying to uncover the mystery of Santa, by waiting and watching, the Santa in charge of that house is contacted and ordered not to show up at that house this year.  These surveillance systems also notify SCU authorities on whether a child's behavior have been good enough this year to receive gifts from SCU.  If a child has been behaving badly over the course of the past year their Santa is also ordered not to visit them that year.  Finally, you may be wondering how I know all this,  and in answer to that question I am telling you that it must remain a mystery.

      I am going to tell you a very sad and tragic story about a very pitiful boy... Once upon a time there was a young boy named Bryan (this boy is not me and is just a young boy who happens to have many things in common with myself). This young boy was told, "You have a very creative mind." And so this boy started out to make good use of his mind. He was looking into ways to utilize his talent when he stumbled upon some thing called "Blogging." Bryan thought this was a good opportunity to test out his skills so he created a blogsite and dedicated it to explaining random things in the world (again remember this is not me, it is a just a coincidence that this boy is so similar to my own individual person). As Bryan started explain things he realized that with each post his vital creativity life organ thingamajig was being drained. However, Bryan refused to stop his posting. Soon it became so bad that that Bryan had to be brought to the hospital to be hooked to the creativity life support. Then another disaster struck. The hospital realized that their supply of creativity was critically low. Now Bryan's life hangs in the balance, threatened by his ever-hungry vital creativity life organ thingamajig. The hospital's only chance and Bryan's last hope is for generous donors like yourself to give ideas to feed his vital creativity life organ thingamajig. Please if you have any ideas or suggestions give for Bryan and help his good cause. Donate IDEAS to the Xplain This Creativity Fund (XTCF).  Thank you so much for your support and be looking for ideas!

      I know we have are all guilty of thinking of crazy people as "weirdoes," "strange," or "messed up". I know I'm guilty, but it's really hard not too. I mean look at them, they have imaginary friends, they think some one (or something) is always following them. Some of them think that our country is over flowing with spies or the government is plotting to brainwash us. We look at the world around us and say "Yeah right." I mean this is total bogus. Again as always, I am going to present to you a whole new (and most definitely "interesting," to put is nicely) view on Crazy People. Now before I get started I am not trying to offend anyone in anyway (and as I xplain my theory, you will see it is the "normal" people who I will be ragging on). Have you ever wondered if those few different people (this is how I will be referring to "crazy people") were really not the "different" ones after all? What if those few gifted people who we ruthlessly lock away in padded rooms, are the only ones who see the world as it really is. Maybe we, the "normal," are blind to the horrible nature of the true, real world. What if this world is so corrupt that it's primary race, humans, cannot even see the reality of it. The different people might have been born with a gift and were meant to go out into the world to open our eyes to see what they see. Yet we lock them away and ignore what they have to say. What if "the government" really has brainwashed us, and their are always spies sent to follow and watch your every move maybe the only one in this world who we are supposed to be able to trust is that thing which we call an "imaginary friend." What if the different people weren't different but just gifted... Or maybe the different people are just plain CRAZY!

      Being a tennis player myself, I have always wondered where the game’s weird scoring came from. I think that once this scoring system was invented people just accepted it as different and started to use it. The question is WHO? invented it and WHY? Well first, let me start off by explaining exactly how the tennis scoring works. The serving player's score is always said first. When the score is: 0 to 0 = Love to Love (Love All) 1 to 0 = 15 to Love 1 to 1 = 15 to 15 (15 All) 2 to 1 = 30 to 15 2 to 2 = 30 to 30 (30 All) 3 to 2 = 40 to 30 3 to 3 = Deuce (40 to 40) 4 to 3 = Server’s Advantage (Ad In) 4 to 4 = Deuce 4 to 5 = Receiver’s Advantage (Ad Out) 5 to 5 = Deuce And so on and so forth... If a player reaches 40 he must win another point to win the game, but the player must win by two points. That is why the score goes to Deuce at 40 to 40, either player must win two consecutive points to win the game. If the score is at Deuce and the server wins a point the score is Ad In because the server only needs one more point to win the game. However, if the receiver takes the next point the score goes back to Deuce, signifying that each player needs two more consecutive points to win. Now that you understand how the scoring system works, I am sure you can see how weird it is. As hard as I have tried I cannot find a simple pattern tying these numbers together. However, I have come up with a plausible theory on how this “kooky” scoring system got started. Let’s start with the easiest part, Deuce. Deuce means 2, and this makes sense because when the score stands at Deuce each player needs 2 points to win the game. Ad In clearly shows that it is the server’s advantage meaning that the server only needs one more point to win and Ad Out is the opposite. Next I believe that Love is used as zero in tribute the game’s inventor or one of it’s very, very earlier players. Love may be the last name of a person who has some role in the game’s history. I also believe that 15, 30, and 40 are just random numbers some one came up with. That would be the simplest solution. I also believe that people accepted this weird scoring system of 15, 30, 40 because it sounds good together and people were ready for a change from the traditional scoring system. I have one other solution to the 15, 30, 40 question. The original inventors of the game might have wanted to give people the feeling that they had more points than they really did. They wanted the first two shots to be worth 15 points (Love + 15 = 15; 15 + 15 = 30), and the next shot to be worth ten to give the person who is behind the feeling that he has a chance to catch up since he is only ten points away instead of 15. This was a very difficult question, but I did my best to think up a theory. I you have any questions or find a flaw in my theory, feel free to post a comment. You may also post comments to give me new ideas for theories.  Till next time, Bryan Strelow

      Sorry, I have not been able to answer any of your questions recently.  I have been on vacation for the past three weeks.  But enough about me...  I have gotten several questions which I am going to answer, first, "Why are blondes so stupid?"  Well this is a difficult question but I have a theory...  First, I believe that being a blonde is much more than just your hair color.  I also believe that not only blondes are affected by what I like to call "ditzyness".  It just so happens that many blondes are born with this condition.  I have concluded, due to first hand experience, that there are some cases of people with severe "ditzyness" that are not blonde.  I think that "ditzyness" is a combination of many minor disabilities such as very slight dyslexia, an unbalance in their equilibrium, and other such handicaps.  This handicap is passed down though a person’s parent’s genetics just like hair color and downs syndrome.  It is fair to conclude that the genes involved in this handicap are present in most blondes and are recessive (non dominant).  This means that unless both parents have this gene the person will not be a “ditz”.
