						   It's been about a week and a half since I've last written...and in that time I've been maid-of-honor at a friend's wedding, visited family, gone to a family graduation party, rallied friends for a roadtrip, worked my butt off, and drove 3 hours up to Mass. after work to stay for 11 hours total before driving 3 more hours back to NY for work the next morning.  And all of this done in the name of love.  Or for love, regarding love....it's all about the love.   I used to have this theory that if you took any action that a person has done that may seem wrong or evil or bad or whatever and explain it through love, it could help the world be a more understanding place.  To define everything as being motivated by the love of something.  For example, a person may steal to feed their family whom they love.  Obviously the morals and ideas get warped along the way, and the more horrible the crime, the harder it is to make the connection, but I tried anyway.  I also try to believe that everyone is good at heart and to love everyone...but lately...well...I'm begninning to doubt these things. There's so much in this world that is just so fucked up....can I write fuck here?  I don't know...but whatever, it's true.  Everyday I hear another story of some weirdo doing some heinous act, or not even that extreme, just some damned rude lady at the cab company talking to me like I'm some bane to her existence when all I was doing was ordering a taxi.... Or people that lie and care nothing for anyone else but themselves, satisfying their immediate primal urges in whatever quick and easy way they can, regardless of how much it may hurt another human being.  -   It's things like this that make me wonder...maybe we aren't all good at heart, maybe evil is a true and real thing that exists, that pulses and breathes within the hearts of some.  I've heard evil described as an absence of God...and I like this definition because I've always defined God as Love.  An absence of love...  it's kind of like how hate is not the opposite of love, but apathy is.  How most people feel the strongest hate only for people they have loved, but the worst hurt is done when you couldn't care less about someone.  Why bad attention is better than none at all.  Evil is the void created in a person's heart when there's nothing left to love.  I think the Cherokee refer to it as a "hickory nut spirit."  When a person's soul is so small from lack of use that it won't survive another incarnation...but while living in this life they cause so much pain and destruction in the world.  But in the meantime there is family, and friends, and trees, beautiful green lush trees on a sunny midsummer day, and there are people, thousands of people, struggling to be heard, to be seen, to be understood, because they do love, they still love despite the weight of the world's problems pressing down upon us, despite the hypocrisies and facades that are forced into our psyche, dementing our concept of truth and beauty....they still love.  It is to all those people I reach out, and if we all reach out together, just enough, I'm sure we'll meet somewhere in the middle, and the strength of our combined lights will obliterate the darkness in the souls of all the rest.  For those of you who do not know, this is a year of transformation...it's a hard thing to do...letting go of past ideas of self, to make room for newer ones.  Rebirth is a wonderful thing...but you gotta withstand the flames first.  Here's to reaching...may it not be in vain...

						   A friend of mine is getting married on Saturday and I'm her maid-of-honor.  We've been trying to figure out how we can get her to fill all the "something old, something new..." requirements, and I suggested a blue garter.  She didn't have enough time to order one, so after talking with her today I decided to make one...I mean..how hard could it be really? Well...maybe not so bad if I already knew how to thread a sewing machine...not to mention sew with one.  But I didn't know these things.   My mother bought me a cute, tiny little sewing machine a year ago, and I never even took it out of the box until today.  Today...7pm..the night before the wedding festivities begin, in a desperate attempt to sew blue ribbon onto white lace.  After a half hour I learned how to thread it, and figured it would all be downhill from there...but no.  There are apparently many things involved such as thread tension and timing...and frankly..I'm not cut out for that sort of thing.  After another hour of honest trying I gave up.  I may still try to hand sew SOMETHING she can wear...but since it's after midnight already...maybe not.  I got an email from a fellow writer friend today...I think I'm beginning to see something I think the universe has been trying to tell me for months now...at least.  I'm not as alone in this world as I thought I was.  It seems there is a fellowship, although it's members may yet be mostly unknown to each other...but I'm starting to honestly believe there are a great many of us who think very much the same...and THAT is a very encouraging thought.

						   Today was a good day.  Soon after it began I found myself sitting in Hella traffic on the way to the Whitestone bridge...don't know why, it just seemed like everyone suddenly had a great desire to go to Westchester.  I was in the left of two lanes crawling along towards the bridge and I noticed in front of me, a merging car far off to the right motioning to the guy in the SUV next to her, pointing to the lane WAY over on the left.  He in turn, opened his window (probably disturbing his Air conditioned haven) to motion to the car next to him that this other lady wanted to get over.  Then he backed up his truck to let her through, and the little 4-door snuck through onto it's desired path.  Then the guy shared some words, maybe a joke with the folks in the next car, and they seemed to be enjoying a moment.  I sat behind them, enjoying their moment as well, and thought to myself how considerate people can be when they choose to be, even Traffic-Trapped, Sweltering-in-the-Summer-Heat New Yorkers.  ...  However, not so sure if that's on option for certain postal workers...as I encountered a very angry PO (that's post office AND pissed off) manager in New Rochelle.  I had to mail some father's day cards...{more on that later} and the line was too long, so I decided to use the machine to get stamps...BAD idea.  The machine SHOULD have had an "out-of-order" sign, but it simply told me that it wanted exact change...which I tried to provide it with.  However, after happily excepting my dollar bill, it just kept spitting out the coins I offered right back at me.  After a few minutes of cajoling, I gave up and hunted down the manager who was apparently stressed.  To make a long story short, I got two stamps out of the machine, but it still had 26 cents of my money...the manager came to take out the money for me, but when I explained to him that I only needed 2 more stamps he became very angry and hostile yelling about how he couldn't help me when there was all these other people on line.  Never mind the fact that if I had gotten on the dumb line in the first place instead of trying to save everyone some time, I would have had my stamps already and been outta there...he did not care...not one bit.    In my own frustration and anger I left in a huff, found a copy shop that sold me stamps with a 8-cent surcharge and got to mail all my cards afterall.  It made me sad that this man was so angry and unreasonable...I mean really, would any of those people been upset if he sold me two stamps?  I didn't think of it till after I left, but I should of just turned to them all and asked outright...I wonder what would have happened... |||**Question to readers:  Would you have been annoyed if the manager allowed me to "cut" to buy two stamps??**|||  Your input would be greatly appreciated :)   I've been reading some blogs...and I find it oddly exciting, a bit comforting, but a bit eerie that there seem to be many bloggers out there whose thoughts and days reflect my own experiences...I wonder what this means.

						     I went to the Diner tonight with my roommate.  He ordered a Stawberry Milkshake.  Those things are amazing and definitely have magical powers.  Then we came home and watched ATHF.  There was a shake there too, although I don't think he's strawberry...a little too sarcastic for that.  I've decided to start a blog.  It's something I think I've always wanted to do, but never knew it existed.  This is the first post...we'll see where things go from here...but Hello World!   As a fortune cookie once told me: "Adventure can be a real happiness."

						   I'm such a loser sometimes.  There are so many things that I want to learn, but I've been so damn lazy my entire life.  That's not true entirely, it's just that a lot of things came easy to me in school early on, and I got used to doing well without doing any work.  But life isn't like that.  To accomplish anything that is really important and meaningful you have to work your ass off.  Effort.  A simple thing really.  A thing in theory I'm not afraid of, but I create all manner of distractions and delusions to keep myself from actually sitting down and practicing flute or studying herbs, or doing anything that will get me anywhere I want to go.    Ani DiFranco has a lyric:  "I wonder if everything I do, I do instead of something I want to do more....this question fills my head..."    Mine too.

						   Friday night I went to the Irish dancing at Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing.  It was, as usual, awesome.  At one point during the evening my partner left the floor to get some water, and I stayed on, watching my other two friends and the rest of the people dance.  The band had taken a break from the reels and jigs to play a simple waltz and the Irish Sets broke up into pairs of people doing their own little thing.  I stood, by myself, watching all the happy couples. Friends, lovers, husbands and wives, sisters, parents, and children.  All of them dancing together.  I saw a man with a blue mohawk waltzing with an average looking woman.  There were barefoot teenagers and foreign grandfathers.  I looked around at everyone and it occurred to me that no matter who these people were, where they came from or where they were going, they all were there to have a little fun, dance and celebrate life, for just a few hours on a Friday night, to laugh and be outdoors and not be bogged down by the oppressivness that life too often becomes.  It reminded me of tribal times, when all people had to do was find food and shelter to survive, and live their lives.  When did we forget that life is meant to live, to enjoy?  When did we stop dancing?    At one point, my dear friend 'Arthorus' pulled me in to make a trio with him and another friend of ours, but I pulled back and let them dance normally, without me.  The other friend turned to me and said "You look so lonely!"  To which I replied: "How could I be lonely?"     I've learned something recently about life and love.  I am not alone.  I have so many dear friends who are all soulmates to me.  It is them I turn to, them I need.  I truly can never be lonely again, because I've acknowledged the love I have for them, and the bond we share, and that is something that will never die.  The next night a friend of mine got tickets for De La Guarda.  It was FANTASTIC!!  In this too, at one point, there was dancing...and it was very real and very alive.  Everyone should go see this show, it was very powerful.  At least, IMHO.  My friend did not get as much out of it as I did.  But if you are passionate, if you like drums, if you like thunderstorms...then you'll like De La Guarda.  Dancing always makes me feel alive.  It inspires me.  I think everyone should dance more, I think if we did, there would be less wars.

						   When I was younger I had an inherent ability to keep secrets.  This is something that has stayed with me throughout my life. I can always be trusted to keep a secret. I pride myself on this ability because it makes me trustworthy, and that is a trait I value highly.  There is also the allure of the mysterious that keeping secrets has.  I remember a time in pre-school when some fellow 4-year-old or whatever asked me how I intended to do something, and I replied (in the most mysterious of ways that a 4-year-old could have) "I have my ways..."   Unfortunately, I remember the response I got to this statement was more of a laughing and mocking than the desired sense of awe and power.  But ah well...what do 4-year-olds know? There is something to secrets, however. Something necessary in them, for the soul.  The book Anam Cara by John O'Donohue has a section about this which I agree with completely, if anyone cares to check it out.  Basically, a secret keeps something sacred.  There is power to a knowledge kept secret.  It demands a certain respect.  In recent years my ability to keep secrets for myself has failed me.  I never stopped being able to keep others' secrets, but I seemed to lost the ability or desire to keep any of my own.  I am by nature a very trusting and open person I think, but I let that get to an extreme where I was ready and willing to tell any passing person my entire life story.  "I have no secrets, nothing to hide."  seemed to be my attitude.  But I did not realize the importance of secrets.  Being honest is one thing, being open another. But revealing the depths of my soul to any passer-by is by far a different thing entirely, comparable to the bible analogy of throwing pearls at swine.  Because something I might consider important when let out into the open, for all to stare at and comment on, often times would appear not-so-special anymore, as it suffered the weathering of being exposed to the critical, mundane attitude of the world at large.  It seems lately I have started to collect secrets again.  Unfortunately not all of them are happy ones.  Some of them are things which I am saddened by, things I wish were not true, but that I cannot change.  There are a few close friends who I will share these with, but I am keeping them secret.  Others I am happy about, very happy about, but I am not sure of their effect on other parts of my life or what they mean, so I choose to keep them secret as well.  The trick to keeping secrets, for me, is maintaing a balance of honesty and secrecy.  I do not condone lying, I hate it with a passion, in fact.  I feel lying is a waste of time and energy and makes everything worse for all involved parties.  But there are degrees and lines, and they seem to always be in flux.  It is quite possible to never tell a lie and yet deceive a person completely and cruely...as Robert Jordan illustrates so well with his Aes Sedai in the Wheel of Time series.  I have 3 rules I live by that I have developed over time:  1.  Follow your heart.  2. Respect others.  3. Have Faith.    I think the lack of respect for each other has reached a terrible point in American society especially and I think it at least partially the cause of so many problems from relationships to the failing economy.  Some of my secrets I have to share out of respect to others, and this will be difficult, but I am no longer going to share my every experience with all manner of aquaintances.  There is something refreshing in this.  Allowing part of my soul to find rest in the darkness again, without the harsh glare of exposure.  One side of the earth, one side of the moon is always in darkness, it has to be this way.  My religion follows nature because that is the closest we can be to Truth.  Everything has a dark side, and to deprive oneself of this can only be destructive.

						   Lately I'm beginning to realize the immense importance of the ability to focus.  To stay centered on any one task at a time, to remember what you're doing and why you're doing it.  I don't know how many times I am at work, or wherever thinking of all the million things I have to do and feeling very inspired and energized to do all of those things.  Then the moment I get home somehow everything gets fuzzy...Or if the inspiration comes at night, by the time I wake up in the morning I've forgotten everything...why did I want to wake up early?  Where is this motivation I felt not so long ago?  Why do I want to live again?   It's not like I just have a bad memory, cuz I can make lists and whatever...it's like I forget the point...I lose sight of the goal,  I forget why I cared in the first place.  Now, I always remember after some time...but it's like I can't keep the ball rolling, I keep hitting little speedbumps along the way and I come to a dead stop, and find myself staring off into the distance for hours, with nothing but an undefineable question floating around in my brain...

						   This morning I started a new job...I'm a massage therapist, so a new job for me means just one more place I work at to try and pay the rent...this would be the fourth different place, working for a chiropractor, once a week, and (here's the exciting part) getting paid per hour whether or not I have patients.  So I drive the 15 minutes, find parking, then go to the office...I meet the doc, and he starts explaining how "he isn't sure how this is going to work..."  I guess he's not as busy as he thought he was going to be.  No problem...he said we'll try it for a few weeks and see what happens.  But he also explained to me how the Physical Therapist seemed to be working out better for his purposes since she can do other doctor-type related stuff, like set up patients for whatever.  Anyway...me and the PT go into this room and hang out for a few minutes, then she gets called to do an errand...2 minutes later the doc comes in, hands me a fifty dollar bill and tells me I can go home, and if he needs me in the future he'll give me a call.  Woo hoo!  So basically I made 10 bucks a minute this morning...too bad it couldn't last...  Having been released from my morning obligation I was able to call my other two places of work to tell one I could come in early as requested, and the other that I could cover if anyone wanted a massage since the other therapist called in sick.  Then I went home to clean out my car, and up my house.   This weekend some friends and I are planning a roadtrip up to visit another friend upstate.  The actual of number of people going has been in constant flux since we thought of the idea 3 weeks ago.  As of this morning..there were only four of us, but after meeting with a friend for lunch and telling him certain people were not coming as expected, he was reconsidering his own attendence for the adventure...  Meanwhile I go to work and have a lovely time...  On the way home I'm blasting my music, dancin' in the car, window rolled down, in my own happy world, singing along.  In the back of my mind I think to myself..."something feels weird about my car."  but I pay it no mind cuz the radio starts singing..."get your motor runnin'....head out on the highway..."  And I start screaming my lungs out.  I'm almost home and "Moondance" come on so I drive around singing, looking for a parking space, then finally find one and park the car...I put on my Club, get out of the car, and then the asian man standing nearby watering his lawn goes to me, "Miss...you have a flat tire...."  What??  I had no idea!!  I can be such an idiot sometimes..  So it's almost 9pm, almost dark and I have to change this tire before I can't see anymore.  My roomate was kind enough to interrupt his laundry doing to help...both of us never having actually changed a tire before.  I have changed my brakes though, which is almost the same, but not by myself.  Anyhow...we manage to pull it off in time for him to get back to his clothes, but I'm left with the dilemma of not being able to drive upstate w/ a donut for a tire.   I was beginning to think the whole trip was getting called off due to unforeseen circumstance...then I called my friend. It seems somehow, during the 7 hours or so since I last saw him, he managed to rally the troops and change the minds of the stubborn and get another 4 "maybe's" for the roadtrip...so now we'll probably have a total of 8 people for the trip...but maybe no car.  I told my friend about my incident w/the road and we both just had to laugh...lookin' up at the sky...wondering...wherever *they* may be.., the ones who orchestrate this whole bunch of nonesense that becomes our lives..."cute, very cute universe...we get it...very funny."  So tomorrow morning I must get a new tire, or get my old one fixed, besides the million other errands I am supposed to do before work, and get everything in order for the trip.  I'm sure I'll get it all done...but never a dull moment...the adventure has begun before we've even got the motor running...

						   ...since I could hold my head up high... ...since I could say that I wasn't addicted... ...since I can say I love myself as well as...  I've realized something today, something I should have realized sooner, but I tend to be dense when the universe is trying to get through to me.  Where was I?... I was at my friend's house, waiting for her to change, looking at things in her room, looked at myself in the mirror, and somehow it just hit me:  Maybe people like me just for who I am.   It seems like a silly thing, something everyone should know, "be yourself" it's the most-used phrase in the book of happiness in life, love, relationships, success, etc.   It's just that I never realized I had this fear: that "myself" was not good enough.  That because I can be bossy or pushy at times, because I may sometimes seem arrogant, and at other times seem like a total ditz, that people may not like me.  How I don't know everything, but desperately want to.  How physically there are things about me that I hate and wish I could change, that I try to change repeatedly in different ways, only to have the same problems return, or else transform into something else.  I have a fear that people see these things that I hate in myself, and also hate them.   Wow...there it is...you've just witnessed a personal epiphany, folks.    Despite all of my many, many, countless flaws, I still have friends who love me dearly and who accept me with all of my imperfections.  Hell, some of them even like me more because of some of those flaws!  I've been getting the message of "acceptence" repeatedly lately.  That the only way to change is to accept the way things are now.  If you deny something you only feed energy into that very thing you are trying to get rid of, and even though it's negative energy, it's still energy, and it feeds the thing instead of overcoming it.  It's the principle behind many martial arts, fighting something never works, you have to deflect the agressive negative energy away from you, and/or transform it to work for you.    I'm going through a period of intense change right now, and I know it's just the beginning.  In 3 weeks I'm moving to Buffalo to live with a new boyfriend who is a very old friend.  I am so excited and hopeful about this move, but the process right now is difficult and scary because there are certain new things I have to deal with, outside of the relationship, and I will not have time to completely deal with them on my own before I move to be with my boyfriend.  So I will be bringing things to the table there that I am unsure of, and I don't know what effect that will have on the relationship itself.    Part of this change, part of the transfomation I am going through, as I have recently discovered, is learning to be myself, completely.  I seem to have formed a strange habit for myself, of hiding.  I've become afraid.  The funny thing is that really is not part of who I truly am.  It's like a virus I've picked up along the way...this fear.   But maybe it's been there longer than I care to admit, because thinking back, I remember a similar fear from years ago.  Being afraid, but for no reason I could pinpoint.   I remember standing on the shore of our beach at night with an old boyfriend and asking him, "If most people fear the unknown, when you don't know what it is you fear, is that just fearing fear itself?"  I don't think either of us really found a solid answer to that question, but I think when you don't know what you're afraid of, it's because you're afraid of knowing.  If I know that I am afraid of people not liking me, that illuminates a weakness in myself.  When you don't know what you fear, it's because you're afraid to admit that you fear at all.  So yes, actually, I guess it is, just fearing fear itself.  Look at that!  Epiphany #2!    I've been trying so hard, too hard, my entire life to be somebody.  To make a difference, to change the world.  And all of my fits and starts have done nothing to that effect, at least nothing noticeable.  That same boyfriend on the beach, (now dear friend) recently told me, in response to my questioning the seemingly-destined doom of any romantic relationship, "maybe you're just destined for greatness."   I laughed at that, because I used to believe it, in my deepest of hearts, that I was, in fact, destined for greatness.   But I've stopped thinking that after all my failed attempts.  Now... well, I have accepted that I just do not know, and will not know, until the end.  But at that point it will not matter.  What's done is done.  What I do now, well... I've decided I want to be happy.  I do want to change the world.  I do intend to, but perhaps in not so grand a scale as I had hoped, maybe it won't be until my next lifetime, maybe it will be too subtle to really matter at all.    It's just that the way I have been living, recently, has not done much good for me or anyone around me, and I'm so very very tired of it.    I've decided to let go of my old ideas on who I was or what my purpose is, and just live.  I trust that through living deeply, my purpose will unfold, and my self will blossom.
