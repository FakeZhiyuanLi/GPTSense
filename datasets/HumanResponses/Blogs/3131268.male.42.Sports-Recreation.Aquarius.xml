						   The last couple of days in Tetbury have been fairly easy, people turning up when they are supposed to and all that.  So I agreed to do a late duty manager shift in Cirencester this evening, not that good an idea when you consider that Thursday lates are one of the toughest.  Anyway, all was going well until just after six o'clock when we notice that one of our team has not turned up for his shift.  "Where is Nic?" we all asked ourselves.  "Could he be late?"  Well it got to about 6:15 and I got on the phone to him to find out where he was, and he was on his way home from his other job.  "What about your shift here tonight?" I asked.  "Oh, I forgot about that" was the reply, "can you find someone else to do it.  I was a bit slow, what I should have said was "CAN I F***!"  Having not found anyone, I am now doing the late shift with only three lifeguards, and only one operational member of staff until 11 o'clock.  In the mean time I am considering the practicalities of having rogue lifeguards bumped off.

						   I was right with knobs on about yesterdays shift, it seemed to go on for several lifetimes.  On top of everything, one member of staff didn't turn up for her shift, which she apparently didn't know about, and could not do anyway.  I don't know who put her name in the diary, but I would really like to give them my most sarcastic thanks.  I did manage to get several shifts covered for next week, but I initialed them so that no one is left in any doubt about whether they have been covered or not.  I've got a 9-5 shift in Tetbury tomorrow, just me and the work experience boy; oh joy!  Still, it should be fairly quiet, and I have several little jobs that need doing, so something good should come out of it.  For a lifeguard, Tetbury has one great quality most of the year; no pool.  Only during the summer holidays do we borrow the use of the school pool.  That might be a good time to start taking holidays.

						   Weekends are easy, depending who you work with.  On Saturday I was working in Tetbury with Kelly, someone you can rely on to turn up and do a good job, even if she does have her blond moments.  On the other hand I was also supposed to be working with a new lad, you know the type, bad attitude, turns up when he feels like it, won't be on the staff much longer etc.  He didn't turn up surprisingly.  Last night I was duty manager in Cirencester, an all together different box of monkeys.  The manager phoned in sick for today; apparently he got hit in the face with a cricket ball and now has five stitches around one eye.  The safest approach to cricket is to watch it on the telly.  Now I really hope England finish off New Zealand today, but they could look a bit more enthusiastic when doing so.  Today I have one of those daft 12 'til 7:45 shifts, a case of get in there and bear it.  Still I'm sure I'll find some way to have fun, I always do.

						   Yes, part of my job is staring into a whole in the ground filled with water.  I just thought I'd create this blog in order to let anyone who may be interested what I get up to while I carry out this amazing occupation.  Well to start with, today and tomorrow are days off, so there's a good start.

						   I have taken several days off in the last week or two, to do things like take my nieces to  urlLink Alton Towers , enjoy the sunshine, etc.  I need to make the most of opportunities like this.  At work at the moment I am organizing the COSHH files, organizing part time staff training, organizing much of full time staff training, organizing resuscitation training, organizing a pool lifeguard course for next month, staring into a large puddle with people in it and getting very hot.  The straw that broke the camels back was being told I was spending Monday afternoon teaching swimming as I was the only fully qualified teacher on duty.  I intend having words with the boss in the next day or two!
