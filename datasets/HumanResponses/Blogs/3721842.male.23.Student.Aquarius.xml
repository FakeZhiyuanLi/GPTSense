        urlLink    so heres today's picture. its a picture of me on the tower of terror in disney world. thas my dad in the center in the green coat. as you can see, he is totally terrirfied by this tower. i am to the left of him. i am equally terrified to be in the tower. but look at the sistah in the front row in red. shes totally cool about being in the tower of terror. shes all like "yeah... what... this tower is my beeeotch. lets roll out..." contrary to that woman's expression, i must tell you, my friends, there was much terror in that tower... that tower of...  terror.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink    ok... 1 blog and 1 comment later, thanks alan... i'm gonna go ahead and post what i said i was going to do. this here is a picture that i took during my first ride on my recently purchased bike. i would say that "i like this picture" its the washington monument... theres some pretty trees... they have flowers. all around very nice. except for the chick in the corner. she totally ruins the scene and i get quite frustrated when i look at the picture and absorb in all its goodness and then remember that the girl is there in the right corner. i'm sure she's really great in real life but in this picture, i must say i dislike her with all my might.  anyways... back to work. please post a comment so ill know if people are reading this. you dont have to register or do anything funny to post either.  talk to you later.  otto&nbsp; urlLink

       hi all, this is my first blog.... i dont know what im gonna do with this thing. i mainly signed up because i hear if i post a couple of times to this thing ill get a gmail invitation.  anyways... i think maybe ill put pictures here... and if anyone here looks at them then they can say something about them... like "i like this picture" or "i dont like this picture" and then ill reply and post here something like "i agree with you" or "i disagree with you" and it should be a grand time for all.   what do you think? what should i put here? (other than porn) if you dont know what i should put here at least say hi to me and let me know that people will actually look at this. i promise to post much more witty, insightful, intelligent, thought-provoking, compelling, smart, fresh, funny, original, and witty, and intelligent, and insightful stuff if i know people are looking at it.  talk to you soon otto

       hello all, well i broke my promise and didnt post pictures sunday, but here they are for real this time. in celebration of this coming weekend's beach trip and hopefully crab fest, i will finally post the rest of the pics from my first beach trip with shel and boyle...     thrasher's fries are so good. as you can tell both shel and boyle think they are money. shel is a nice guy. he will probably blog here soon about food that is good. trust me, shel is probably one of the world's preeminent authorities (along with myself) in classic, as well as, modern foodology. im thinking if you ever meet shel, you would have to at least refer to him as dr. shel. anyways... hopefully that was enough shameless plugging of shel that he will continue to read this blog and not cut my readership by 33%. oh by the way, did i mention that shel is very good looking and very much what the ladies want?      anyways, back to the beach trip. the boardwalk is always tons of fun at the beach. here you can see me having tons of fun spraying pirates with water. haha... silly pirates....     well... as you can see after all the fun at the beach, one can get really tired, especially after eating thrashers, grotto pizza, a couple of lemonades, water, a soda... yep its a tough life at the beach.  so that was my beach trip. maybe next week you'll get to see some pics of guys eating crabs. oooh... doesnt that sound delicious?  talk to you all soon. otto

       sorry the posts aren't coming as frequently as before. once a week is still pretty good right? first off let me respond to some comments... no alan, gmail doesnt mean gay mail or girly mail or g string mail or... galapagos islands mail. it is a free email account from google who owns blogger.com. you get 1gb of storage which is a gigando amount of storage which i intend to fill with pornography, bootleg movies, and illegal mp3 downloads - the only 3 useful things to use the internet for. this is contrarty to what most people believe the internet is useful for.  in fact, practically no one uses the internet for meaningful research, doing online banking, or keeping in touch with old friends. even if people do use the internet for such activities there are vastly more people using it for downloading porn, and illegal movies and music. anyways... thats what gmail is.  right now not everyone can get it. you must be invited to receive it and i hoped that starting this blog might get me one of those coveted invites. contrary to what jd said, you are basically not cool if you do not have a gmail account. it is a known and proven fact that people with gmail accounts are money. they are more likely to be cool, successful, and have a much higher percentage of scoring with insanely beautiful women. so you see jd, it is very important for me and also for you, and for that matter, everyone to get gmail accounts. if we dont get one soon or have to wait till gmail gets released to the general public we might as well shoot ourselves in the face.  ok, enough with that now on to today's pictures... actually i have to go now and take a shower, so i promise tomorrow i will post pictures.  talk to you all soon. otto

       sorry for not blogging in so long. things have been sort of busy and i have switched to a new computer. its also become clear to me that i will probably not get gmail by doing this so these past couple of days ive been deeply pondering what to do with this blog... and after many a torturous night, wrestling with my inner demons, and searching the deepest depths of my soul... i have decided that.....  the blog must go on....  so loyal readers (sasso, shell) fear not, for more witty, interesting, compelling, funny, light hearted, serious, intriguing, enlightening, intelligent, gripping, and witty, and light hearted and interesting commentary on the issues that matter most to us will be coming soon. there's also been massive interest from numerous readers (sasso, shell) to open up my blog so that others may try their best to provide witty, interesting, funny, serious, compelling, enlightening, gripping, witty, and funny posts. however, this blog shall remain otto's blog because... i have no idea how to change the name of it. in any event... if you want to blog about stuff email me and ill figure out how you can do that. either way... if you post a comment that gets automatically posted on the blog.   so yeah... look forward to guest blogs about pirates and dinosaurs and why they are so money and why ninjas are big fat hurtings... and also blogs about pictures ive taken and maybe blogs about food i've eaten along with blogs about food shell has eaten.  sorry no pictures today. i dont know how to do that with this new computer.  see you all soon otto
