      Finally after the ritual of meeting all relatives (something I do on every visit to pune)&nbsp;and giving away the gifts on saturday I'm a free bird to do what I want ..went to Sheela's birthday party last nite and met ofcourse Sheela (who was conmpletely surprised), Snehal, Santosh and Sritej, and Shama was there too...  &nbsp;This afternoon&nbsp;I met all my friends at our adda (Marzorin) akki didnt make it but I was so so so ....happy to see Rohan, Burhan &amp; Vishal&nbsp;and was surprised to see Pragnya with Rohan !  We had a ball chatting up pulling each others leg and Rohan and Burhan as usual arguing about everthing on earth...I'm missing this all for the last 3 years and Rohan kept saying " WHY dont you come back...? You hate being in Hyderabad and we all miss you then WHY "? ...  Even I ask myself the same Q ......  &nbsp;  Is it all worth it? Will I get what I want and be able to do what I want?.....

      Monday is an extended weekend due to July 4th...And Rahul has finally convinced me to watch   SPIDERMAN   ..so i watch the movie and guess what? I liked the movie and also Toby Maguire!   Its time to say "seeya" to Rahul (I hate saying Goodbye)...dont know when I'll see him again. I feel very odd,feel as though I've lost something precious...  Why is life always so difficult? Why can't life give you what you want?  And why are there tears...after happiness & joy?  I miss Rahul...

      After a superb saturday,with great plans for Sunday which were modified till the last minute...I'm not complaining, instead I'm glad the way it turned out.  The spirit of Santa Monica and Promenade is still fresh from last evening and today I'm taken to a new world in   Malibu  . It's one of the most scenic drives I've had...gazing out of the car window to catch a glimpse of the Pacific in between the hills ..WOW!!! What a sight! Will forever be etched in my mind. The drive lead us to a very beautiful   Temple   of Lord Venkateshwar & Ganesha. My dad's gonna be glad coz he wanted me to visit a temple while I'm here.   After pleasing the God's it was back to the  Beach . I have never ever enjoyed myself at a beach as much as I did at Malibu..Not to much of crowd,clear water, and Rahul with me(He would have thrown me into the water..   he thinks!hahaha   ),What else could I ask for?  Every time I said I want a picture ,or please hold the camera..Rahul would go..."you Tourists are...". Hey but I've managed to capture him in some wonderful shots.  The evening ended with some good Indian food at a restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard.. And what I had there and after that is a secret I share with Rahul.. Also I had a long conversation with my Mom in the night!!!  In short I had a blast...

      This is my last weekend in CA...next friday I fly back to India. I DONT want to go back..but... Friday was half day at office did almost nothing. Rahul ( my cute friend  ..according to EKTA)came over to Ontario and we watched  Farenheit   9/11  together. He narrated some of his  JHOLS . He is just so......               On saturday drove around the beautiful Beverly Hills and then to Santa Monica where finally my desire of touching  the waters of Pacific ocean  was fullfilled. Walked across the   Promenade...  it was buzzing with lights , people and more people. Reminded me of my time in Times Square last year.  So many stores to look around..I did my best to irritate Rahul by taking him into every store that sold Shoes.And finally as He had predicted didnt find anything to my liking. In short my  hunt for shoes  is still ON! Some more plans are on for a Superb Sunday...Catch Ya!!  Thanks Rahul for such a Memorable Weekend !
