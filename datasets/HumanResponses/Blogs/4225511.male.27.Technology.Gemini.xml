      Dude, you'd think it's a joke but uhh... they made a Ultra-man style Kiko-man (kikoman is a soy sauce brand if you don't know). I hope it's a prank... I thought Pepsi Man was kinda crazy already.   urlLink http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/000322.php

      I've always been confused about the two terms and I finally did a little research on it.  Very informative read here:  urlLink Twin Scroll Turbo   Now when it comes to Twin Turbo, there seems to be two different versions: Sequential Twin Turbo, and the regular Twin Turbo. Twin turbo is simply fitting 2 turbo chargers under the hood; while the Sequential Twin Turbo means having two different turbos under the hood, having 1 cover for the other's shrotcomings.  Here's a short quote: "he Supra's engine has a 0.5-litre swept capacity advantage and it also relies on just one of its sequential twin-turbos to give a massive whack of boost (and therefore torque) at low rpm and load. The second turbo then comes on to maintain torque in mid-to-high rpm and load ranges. Put simply, this two-stage turbo system gives a tremendous dollop of torque everywhere in the rev range.  The Soarer - most unfortunately - doesn't have a sequential turbo set-up. The gasses exiting its 1JZ-GTE head are constantly divided into two simultaneously operating turbos; this means boost response and low-rpm torque are both a fair way behind the sequentially-turbo'd RZ Supra."  and that's not it... there are quite a few other turbo variations such as twin entry turbo which has 2 divorced turbo inlets.  I think I've had enough of this for the day...

      Well I never thought I'd get one of these... but I really can't come up with a better way to store my bookmarks across all the different computers I use.  I was going to put the links on a page and put it on one of my sites, but I'll have trouble keeping a single most updated version without confusion.  So here we go :)   I was browsing  urlLink nasioc  and somebody was asking about those white lights (with a blue film).  I came across a very good read a while ago, and learned a lot from it.  See the link below:  urlLink http://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/bulbs/blue/bad/bad.html   Modding my car has been a very good learning experience, although it's uhh... quite expensive.
