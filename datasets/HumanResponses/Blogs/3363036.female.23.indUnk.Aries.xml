      I have attended thus far, 5 theory lessons and i must say the best was conducted by this guy named Mr Woo. I enjoyed his lesson coz he related it to real life driving disasters haha..   Altho he has this 'i-take-no-nonsense' kinda look,he is actually an interesting guy! Anyway, i juz wanna share with U some stories he told us during the lessons.    STORY#1: Animals Ahead    Mr Woo was doing his job as usual as an instructor with his learner driver. They were driving along and he spotted a bird on the road ahead. Hence, he warned his learner. The learner said, "Where? Where? Got meh?" and before Mr Woo could say another word, they heard crushing sounds of bones beneath the car. Eeiyer, some of u say.. but the learner say "Where got? Dun have wat.." Pekak-badak ke budak tu sampai sound camtu pun tak dgr! Anyway, they made a U-turn to go back to the site. The poor animal was like pancake and it made the learner totally freaked. At the traffic light junction, Mr Woo said the learner was perspiring all over altho the aircon was on. "Eh, got animal ahead!"Mr Woo said after they continued their drive. Immediately this learner stopped the car (nasib takde kreta lain pat blakang)"How now?" said the learner who spotted the animal on the road. "Shoo it awaylah," said Mr Woo. "Shoo! Shoo!" the learner went (complete with the hand actions). Mr Woo said to us in the class as he related the story, "When my learner did that, I laughed like hell lah in the car. She was shooing the animal from inside the car!" Macamlah binatang tu leh dgr with all the windows of the car drawn up, kalau iya pun use the horn-lah.. haha. "Lucky thing she didn't get out of the car to shoo it away, that would have made me laugh harder and perhaps even the passing drivers," said Mr Woo. Apparently, this girl selalu kena animal related incidents after that. Once, they drove along Bt Timah and they had to stop for a tortoise to cross. Tu kalo horn pun tak guna, tak leh speed nye! hehe.. Muz be the curse of the pancaked bird at work gaknya.    STORY#2: The Zig-zag cyclist    This cyclist seems to enjoy making things difficult for learner drivers from this driving centre i enrolled in. Mr woo tells us of this man who would immediately ride his bicycle in a zig zag fashion whenever he spots cars from this driving centre. The worst part is he would do his zig-zag cycling across the whole lane, making it impossible for the learner driver to proceed without hitting him. A while back, this man did as he usually would when he spotted one of the driving centre's car. The driving instructor in the car told the learner, "Juz horn once and overtake on the right." The learner did as he was told and the as soon as he had overtaken, the cyclist tailed them all the way to the driving centre. At the drivin centre, he created a commotion in the instructor's room (sebab he cdnt tell who was who, all instuctors wore the same uniform pe!)"Wei! Whose the fella who horn me huh?" To settle things, the supervisor was called and the instructor apologized. Howver, the apology failed to appease the angry zigzag cyclist. "U all better watch out, u dunno where i came from." After that day, whenever the instructors spot this zigzag cyclist ahead, they will tell the learners to either right turn, left turn or U turn to avoid him. Of late, this zigzag minded cyclist is no longer seen around. Perhaps he has returned to where he came from -Changi Prison. ;p    STORY#3: The Taxi Driver    There was once this taxi driver working the late night shift. He drove along Lim Chu Kang area and a lady dressed in white flagged the taxi at one of the deserted bus stops. Being the smart taxi driver that he is, this guy stopped his cab a slight distance ahead of the bus stop. He did it to get a good look of the lady from the rear view mirror.. juz in case.. u know..He looked at the rear view mirror and noticed that this lady who was in all white outfit had messed up hair. He didnt feel too good about it. So apa lagi, he engaged his gear and terus drove off-lah! Next morning.....   "Hello, Mr XXX. We're caling from LTA"  That lady at the bus stop had filed a complain against him.
