      My wife did not come with me, so as expected, I got to church 15 minutes early.  I left my daughter at the child’s room and I headed to the auditorium. Enjoying my solitude and taking advantage of the absence of people, I looked for a seat close to the stage and began to drift away. Without any notice, the musicians came out, I looked at my watch and it was still early for the service. They grabbed their instruments and began to play their music. The singer was not there, so I figured the musicians were just warming up. The drums, a bass, a saxophone and a piano opened the show. Soon afterward the guitar player appeared, he was a chubby white guy with glasses, he was wearing black pants and an extra tight black T-shirt. He stopped walking and stood still. Then, the pianist looked at him and gave him a sign with the head. The guitarist began to play. The chubby guy was just amazing. He was a genius with his instrument. The tunes, scales, and chords got more complicated and complicated by the minute; and with that, the music was getting better and better. I just couldn’t believe this geek looking dude was so darn great. I looked around to see how the people were reacting to the show in front of us. For my surprise, they weren’t even listening, they were talking with each other without noticing the great musician on stage. Santana, Slash, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton would have loved to listen to this kid play. They would have probably learnt one or two things as well. The music was getting better by the second now. The guitarist at this time had his eyes closed and got lost in his own music. A minute later, he looked disturbed, like he was not breathing correctly.  Next second, he jumped onto the center of the stage and start moving his whole body like he was possessed by his music. He let all the weight of his body fall upon his knees. He was still playing his guitar, but now he had an expression of pain on his face. The music became faster and louder, he was on fire. I looked at the rest of the band and they were playing without noticing the chubby kid. I looked at the audience once again and they were still talking with each other unaware of the magical performance. The guitar player could not hold it anymore, he was living the music; he threw away his glasses, ripped his shirt off and smash his guitar against the floor three times. He ruled. I stopped breathing for a few seconds. Then, I heard a voice from behind that said, “That was unbelievable.” I turned around and it was probably a fourteen-year-old kid who was trying to talk to his parents. They didn’t answer to him. He then looked at me and repeated his declaration. I nodded comradely without saying any words.

      How many times do you have the chance (or the courage) to tell the people you care about that you love them? I mean, you may show it with actions; but do you actually say it? I’ve heard that before somewhere, but that thought just came from nowhere that afternoon. So I was decided. As soon as my class was over I jumped into my truck and I hit the road anxiously. I got home fairly quickly, but followed by some ignored stop signs yelling at me for respect. I shut them up and walked towards the front entrance. I opened the door and saw my mother-in-law in the living room watching her dull soap opera, I mechanically nodded to her and skipped some routinary questions. I looked around and I knew it. I went to the kitchen, my two-year-old daughter was sitting on her chair in front of the dinning table. I took a big breath, gave her a kiss, neared her ear and proceeded. I declared the obvious information to her. She listened to me. Next, she moved her head back and looked at me, keeping silence for two or three seconds with an expression that confirmed her understanding of what I meant. Then, she looked at the piece of paper laying on the table in front of her, looked for a crayon, grabbed it, and said to me with the cutest voice in the world: “Paint?” Undoubtedly, her brilliant answer made much more sense than my foolish attempt. We drew and painted silly faces. We loved each other forever.

      Television has its ways to give you pleasant surprises once in a while. I was being the victim of a steady succession of really bad music, to the point that I was going to give up to a virulent reality show or a low budget sitcom. After probably 20 minutes of  “Hit me baby one more time”, “I’m pretty, that’s why you buy my album”, and “We are all sweaty ‘cause we shake our booty,” they abruptly appeared.  For a moment I thought I had changed the channel by mistake, I saw these Hispanic looking guys dressed with clothes that somehow resembled Tex-Mex bands, but no, I was still with VH1. They were three, two of them would have been considered fat for the American standards, and the last one, the vocalist, was tall and slim but with very long hair, maybe too long to be reckoned cool. Two of them, also, had the incipient and immature mustaches that reveal the old mixture of Spaniard and Indian blood in a past generation. They were not the kind of people you usually expect to see on that particular TV station.   For my amusement, the music was great, the tunes very well constructed, and the lyrics decently catchy. The voice of the vocalist was not pretty, even better, it was cool. The band is just great as a whole. Their name, “Los Lonely Boys”, and the song “Heaven.” So if you want to hear a song that will make you feel cool while singing in the shower, while trying a new move looking at yourself in the mirror, or while driving on the highway at nigh or by the beach; give it try, you may enjoy it very much. Vamonooosss!!!

      I threw the boomerang that hit me. We were in class when I told my friend I had just created this little place on the Internet: my own  blog . He gave me a half smile and, confident of the effect he was going to cause, he said, “Why? Do you wanna tell the world how you feel?” I didn’t answer and we both laughed convulsively. We knew it.

      Yesterday my left index finger suddenly attacked me. We were at work, eyes looking at the computer monitor, left hand and fingers holding my face, my forearm standing straight, and my elbow loyally supporting all the weight of my head against the desk. But unexpectedly, for reasons that I have not figured out yet, the little fellow scratched my right eye. Seemingly, my eyelid played its role in this kind of agitated cartel; it stayed wide open letting me experience this insurgency. I was blind for about one minute keeping my eyes closed thinking how all this happened. It is not like I have been giving reasons to my fingers to rebel against me. I wash them everyday and cut their nails weekly. On their side, they are good guys, I mean, some times they let drop glasses full of water or particularly fragile objects; but besides that we have always been in the same team. Furthermore, we’ve been together for over 23 years, come on, I respect them, they should do the same. I pictured my eye just like those scratched sunglasses or goggles you put on and you can actually see the mark. I thought I was going to have to polish the surface or order a replacement. I even looked for a mirror to try to find a visible scratch on my cornea. Yet, I didn’t find any more reasons to feel disconcerted. For the rest of the day my eye was hopelessly sensitive to any bright light.  But today, after tedious protocols and lots of lobbying, we signed a treaty. Some cells died for it, and some others were taken directly to the nearest infirmary. They decided to help my finger make up its defiance. Thanks to that, my eye feels fresh and renovated, like nothing ever happened. My eyelid blinked “I’m sorry” and we all promised to look out for each other just like in the old days. We are just terribly alive.

      Today I am giving birth to a new output of my thoughts and feelings.  This place will be the reflection of my lately inhibited necessity to write for pleasure. Future lines will attempt to be well intentioned and honest, hoping that my distorted, spoiled, ungrateful, and often selfish perception of the world bears with them. “Seasoned Happenings” start crying, start breathing, start looking around you and within yourself, start smiling, and start sobbing.  Live.

      You stab their backs and then you bleed for them.  You promise rose petals, but again, you deliver spikes and rust.    "Yo no sé  cómo hay quien malversa la vida  cómo hay quien invoca una herida  como pueden gastar el amor.  Yo no sé  Como si nos faltaran cadenas;  como si nos sobraran las cenas  como si diera dicha el dolor.  Yo no sé" ABRACADABRA - Silvio Rodríguez
