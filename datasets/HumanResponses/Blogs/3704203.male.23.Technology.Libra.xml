      Interesting development in my professional life lately.  This all started about a month ago, I saw an ad in the local paper for a Network Consultant gig.  I sent a resume in thinking I was way under-qualified and way out gunned when it came to getting a call back or interview or anything.  To my suprise, I got a call on my cell phone about a week later, wanting to set up a phone interview to talk about my qualifications.  I go through the motions of talking with human resources, and doing an initial interview, still not taking it too seriously as I am pretty happy with my current gig.  So, a few days later I get another call, they want a 3rd interview with me.  The firm I am interviewing with is a fairly large company, so I thought the third interview would be nearing a final decision.  I went into the interview not expecting an offer... I left with a verbal job offer, which I accepted on the spot.  The new gig is doing consulting, which I have always wanted to do on my own anyway, I just have never had the jack to get a startup off the ground.  Midwestwired.net went out on 3 service calls then was disbanded.  Gelttech.com went under before registering a successful service call(this happened while I was in college, so I wasnt really into it anyway).  The last venture has actually been doing pretty well.  I have been doing private consulting since I came home in march of 2003.  I am by no means striking it rich fixing old ladies email and internet accounts or removing spyware from overburden windows desktops, but the extra $ comes in handy at times!  Stay tuned for updates on the new gig and exit woes from the current...

      So a few months ago, I bought a used jon boat for use on the Mississippi River.  The bank was like, "Sure, we can finance this for you!  Just write a check and well take care of it."  Fair enough.  So the loan all gets set up with a direct withdrawl from my checking account on the 20th of every month, I check today- the automatic withdrawl from my checking account never went through, so now my loan is late.  Then I get a note in the mail from my bank wanting insurance information for my boat.  I called my insurance man and set up all the insurance, etc.  I found out today that they never bothered to send proof of insurance to my bank, so now my loan is in default.  What a pain in the arse-  I dont know why this has to be this hard...

      More and more I realize that although CLECs are a necessary and sometimes good alternative to monopolistic dial tone carriers, they are just not technically equipped to handle the needs of a modern telco.  For example, the CLEC in my town  urlLink Mediapolis Telephone Company , now offers dsl and has offered dail-up internet access independently for some time, they do not have a technically proficient enough staff to make sure that service levels of critical services, read:email and web browsing, are not interrupted continuously by the threat of virus traffic.  I understand that small CLECs have limitations, I just dont see how these limitations should cause degraded service problems for paying customers.  I think that if more local carriers who offer internet access would treat their services like a WAN environment, where security is important, a lot of the problems people have with email viruses constantly going around from local user to local user and as recently problems with worm invasion of the networks would go away.  But in the mean time, I am happy fixing the mess left behind by our incompetent telephone company- the more service calls the better!

      I am not sure how many people that may read this are familiar with dirt track oval racing in the Midwest, but the mix of people that you get at any even of this genre is quite interesting.  I am pretty sure that I am the only person in the grandstands this evening who had a collar on my shirt, let alone a Polo shirt with a colar.  For the un-initiated, I live in a very blue collar corner of the world.  Southeast Iowa, USA, is in the heart of the old manufacturing rust belt, and the rich agricultural corn belt.  In no way am I bashing this kind of thing, it is very necessary, in fact vital to the world economy that the people that live here do what they do;  farm or work in a factory of some sort.  The majority of US exports of soybeans and good percentage of corn exports come from Iowa;  every Case Backhoe in the world at one time came through the Case (now Case-New Holland) plant in Burlington.  The world still very much needs welders, mechanics and farmers- it would be a very different place without them.  My point is that sometimes I wonder what I am doing here.  Tonight at the races I am pretty sure that I was the only one there who can write html, understand how the internet really works, can configure a router or even knows what a switch is.  I am definitely a minority here... so if you live in Southeast Iowa and know anything about network technology, please email me- im feeling a little isolated...

      All of this bluster surrounding the propaganda piece "Farenheit 9/11" has really got me into a frothy lather lately.  I am in awe or how people can look at a clearly biased "documentary" like this and draw any reasonable conclusion other than Michael Moore is a total leftist idiot.  Further, the man is anti-american in the worst possible way, he spews forth anti-american rhetoric any chance he gets.  Granted, he is entitled to do so, in fact, he is protected by the very consitution of the country that he rails against when overseas.  As the saying goes, the cuffs dont match the collar-  the man is a crum bum, end of story.  For more in depth  FACTUAL  information on why Micahel Moore should be sent to Etheopia for food see  urlLink moorewatch.com
