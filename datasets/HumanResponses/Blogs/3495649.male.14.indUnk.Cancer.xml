            Morris was almost asleep when he heard the man walking toward the bench. Morris's bench. The man was well groomed and had long, gelled, black hair. His small beard could give someone the impression that he was a single Russian man. He was a single Russian man. His rag-tag moose-skin jacket made him look unemployed. He was unemployed.  A sound eradicated through the park as the man stepped on a small branch.   "Buhgaa, Hawuuga!", screamed Morris as he fell hard from his bench to the gravel.  "Hey, comrade, is vonly me!", the Russian Man jumped as he saw the hobo fly into the air from the bench. He ran over and found Morris fainted on the ground. He needed to wake him up. The Russian Man picked up Morris and threw him into the pond behind the bench.  Morris woke up. As he screamed and sunk into the murky waters he looked up and saw a tall hairy man standing near his bench. The man was gripping the bench like he was going to brake it. "No! That's my bench!", he screamed helplessly as he sank. He couldn't pay to take swimming lessons.   His head submerged into the cold water. He tried flailing his arms to pull him back up. His face came out of the water again. Suddenly he realised there was a tall hairy man gripping his bench. He let out a girlish scream as the hairy man jumped into the water on him. Morris could feel large, strong hands grip his back, trying to pull him up. He bit the man's neck. Another hand grabbed his collar and pulled him to shore. As he struggled to breathe, he noticed his best friend, Dmitri Varkov, soaked next to him also trying to breathe.  "You...", whispered Morris "I can't believe you... you... fended off the hairy man!  "What?", resonded Dmitri.  "The hairy man who tried to steal my bench..."  "Ummm... Yeah that's it. I uh beat up the hairy man."  Another branched snapped in the woods.  "He's back.", whispered Morris" The bastard!"

           It was cold, very cold. The man sat upon his bench in the middle of Central Park. His bench was his friend he had come to it every time he got depressed or needed someone's love.      Sometimes when people came to the park to cheer him up, they would say things like: "This isn't  your  bench" or " I don't see your name on it." The man would just stand and show them the many times he had wrote on the bench Morris's bench.      This bench was Morris Dempsey's house. The only place he had. He was a sad homeless man who was abortioned by his parents who remarked, "We only did it for the fun."      For 32 years Morris had lived here on this bench talking to squirrels and cursing and at women's babies. But tonight that would all change. Soon, even the rich people would envy him. Yet, he had no idea of what was to come. So he sat on his lonely, wooden bench.

      "Ummm... I need to go.", Trent got off a woman's lap.   Screaming could be heard from the hall, "You'll never take me alive! I swear by the grave of my Bonzi, i'll break out of jail and kill each and every one of you!"  Trent trotted out of the bar and down the hall. He walked up to the elevator, pushed the button, and waited. A ring came from above the doors. They slid open.  "Sir I've been looking for you everywhere!", a short, young exeutive ran out of the elevator and handed Trent a clipboard. "This is GeneoTech's yearly income. As you can see it's dropped a lot since October."  "Mr. Lawson, I'm kind of buzy."  "But sir, if this continues, we'll be bankrupt by September!", Ferguson Lawson screamed.  "Do you know what the source is yet?"  "Yes sir. Sector 23. What ever they're doing done there it's not there job."  "Ok go down and check on them.", Trent got off on the next floor.

      Trent walked past them as if they weren't there. He trodded gracefully through the club to another large double-door labled: No Entrance. Kicking it open, the aristocrat glided into his personal joy room.   He sat on a soft couch surrounded by beautiful woman in Victoria's Secret bikini-wear. One burnet aproached him from behind, unbuttoned his shirt, and began to massage his shoulders. The other women started to inch closer to him and caress his body.  "How does this feel Mr.McCain?", the massaging girl said.  "Emmmmm. You have no idea.", Trent closed his eyes in relaxation.  Through the double doors, in the dance hall came the sound of a yelling man.  "Move!", the man awoke Trent from his relaxation."Get out of my way!"  The doors shot open. "I can't take it anymore!", it was Glen Sneedly, one of Trent's high-assistants. He had round glasses, a pointy nose, and short gray hair.  "What, what is it?", Trent stood.  "It's the new intern, Davis! He is incooperative and mean and all he does is talk back! Like yesterday, he stole my lunch and ate it infront of me. And today! Oh let me tell you what he did today!", Sneedly had a crazy, hysterical look on his face. "Today, he got on my computer and deleted my Bonzi buddy! And I was just sitting at my pc, crying, with no Bonzi to cheer me up.", he started to cry.  "So go do something about it. You're a higher rank.", Trent sat again.  "Oh thank you sir. I'll do something about it.", he went from weeping to laughing hysterically almost instantly.  He ran out of the room. About 30 seconds later, his scream was heard again, "There you are you little punk." Three gunshots rang out in the distance. The dancing stopped.

      Trent McCain glided down the hall struting like a movie star. He pulled up the folded-down collar of his bright white button-down. He was also wearing matching white pants with black leather shoes. His shirt was swinging open with a blue undershirt underneath and a red tie.  He was in a long, curved, marble hallway with large windows on the left looking out on the lawn and doors on the right. His bright brown hair was gelled up like a wave.  At the end of the hall, sat large double-doors. With a swift push, they glided open. Inside was a dark room full ofdancing people. To the right there was a bar and a disco ball hang from the ceiling. As he entered the room, six women came running up screaming.  "Oh my god, it's Trent!", said one.  "I saved a dance for you", said a half-naked woman belly dancing.

      His head shot out of the water like a jet. His hands smoking. His long black hair and beard were once again soaked. He climbed out of the water gasping.  "I guess I'll have to wait for it to cool off. So um hairy man... Since we're gonna get to know each other.", Morris didn't notice the hairy man roll his eyes. "Why not start now. I'm Morris Dempsey and the man on my left is Dmitri Varkov. So um who are you?"  "My name is -"  "Stewie?", the woman was begining to wake up."Stewie what's going on?"  "Your husband has now officially become my financial helper.", Morris said with a grin.  "Who are you?", said the woman. She had long, blonde hair that curled at the bottom into her thin neck. Her face gave away the impression that she was an angel. From Morris's first view of her he could tell she was just with the geek for the money.  "My name is Morris Dempsey and this is Dmitri Varkov. Your moneymaker was just about to introduce you two.", Morris said moneymaker because he couldn't think of anything correct to say. He wasn't a boyfriend because you have to be in love to be boyfriend and girlfriend.  "My name is Stew Catsenburg. I'm a stock broker for a very famous and rich company called GeneoTech. And this is my wife Sandy."

      Morris looked at the burnt plank in his hands. It was splintered on both sides and was about a foot long. He hugged it. "So um, Hairy Man.", he looked as if he was about to cry. "Um...How are you gonna make up for this?"  "What? I didn't do this!", the man wriggled in his rope. "I'm just a severely confuse stock broker!"  "That's it. You'll be my financial helper! I need lots of money and you're gonna make it happen."  "You know,", the stock broker said with anger, "when this is all over, I'm going to sue you for every penny you've got!"  "Oh, that's a problem you see.", Morris pulled out the innards of his pockets. Nothing came out.  "I'm not doing any work for you!", the glasses on his face fell crooked on his nose. He couldn't fix them.  "Wrong answer!", a smile/menacing look came across Morris's face. He pulled the man by the neck to the edge of the pond and dunked the man's head into the water. He didn't pull it up for another minute.  The man's head came back out of the water and he took a heaving breath. "Okay! I'll help you just don't hurt me!"  "Thank you. Now... Give me advice. How can I become rich? Huh? Huh ?"  "Um... Sell... The rock.? Yes! Sell the meteor to a museum! That's it!"  Morris got down into the crater. He grabbed the red hot boulder.  "AAARRRGHHH!", for the third time that night he dove into the pond.

      The hairy man began to squirm in the water. It's hard to swim when your arms and leg are tied up.  "Vese people hoff notszing to do vith zis.", Dmitri yelled. Almost tripping over a branch, Dmitri ran beside Morris and pulled the man out of the pond. "Are vou crasy?", Morris started screaming at Morris.  As Dmitri continued to scream in Morris's ear, Dempsey heard none of it as he stared at the meteorite in the crater where his bench used to be. It looked like a big, mishapen ball of fire. It was red hot and cooling down.

      Morris stood in shock staring straight forward into nothingness. He didn't even notice the hairy man and the unconscious woman fly 6 feet in the air over him. They then landed abruptly on the lawn near a couple trees. The man was moaning in sharp pain and the woman was still laying unconsciously on the ground, but now had a bloody nose.  "Buh... Vhat? Vhat happened?", Dmitri lay sprawled on the ground in a way no man should ever be tangled. He was huffing to get a breath.  Morris was still staring past the flaming wreckage blankly. For the first time he moved. His stiff body fell to the ground and landed on a sharp rock. In a normal situation, this would have caused great pain causing the  faller to scream and get off the rock. However, this was not a normal situation. Morris hit the rock, felt the pain, but did not move. He was as frozen as an icicle.  "Morris? Morris!", Dmitri ran and kneeled by Morris's side. He began to wave his hand in front of Dempsey's face.  Morris blinked. He sat up his back to the flaming crater. His head shook, "Where am I? Dimtri... is that you?"  "Yeah, stay calm. Everyving is ok."  Morris turned around and saw the fiery crater. He gasped. He ran forward to the wreckage. The was only one piece of his bench still together. It was on fire. He quickly grabbed the piece with his bare hands and jogged with the flaming 2x4 and jumped into the pond.  When he finally climbed out of the water with the blackened, put-out wood he walked painfully toward the crater.  "What?...", he was breathing heavily "What happened here?"  "Ve don't know.", gasped Dmitri.  Morris then noticed the 2 tied-up bodies on the ground. "YOU!", Morris screamed at the hairy man. "You did this!" Morris began to log roll the mall down the hill and into the pond.

      2 seconds after the man woke up he noticed a tall, raggy hobo. This made him jump. Suddenly he realized he couldn't jump because he was tied up. This also made him jump.  "Who are you?", said the man hesitantly.  "Names do not matter right now. You are the hairy man.", Morris stated matter-of-factly.   "The what..."  "The hairy man, who attacked me."  "I'm... I'm not hairy.", said the man while glancing at his chest.  Morris got down on one knee and leaned over the man. "How much money do you have?"  "Middle-class, why?", the man's glasses fell off his face.  "Because I'm gonna' sue you for all you got! You are a slime to humanity, you rich people that beat up defenseless homeless guys!"  "What are you talking about?"  "Ves, vhat are vou talking about?", said Dmitri with an quizzical look on his face.  Everyone's attention was on this conversation, thus no one noticed what was happening in the sky.  "You make me sick! All I've got is this bench, and I tell you, not even the hand of God himself can take it from me."  Suddenly, the bench exploded into flying, flaming pieces of wood.

      Dmitri watched as Morris pulled yet another body from out of the woods. This time, it was a woman. She was an attractive, blonde who was wearing a dark blue business skirt and black high-heels.  "The rope.", said Morris not even looking at Dmitri.  "Listen, Morris. 'Ere vas no man who attacked you. I vas trying to wake you up. I couldn't sleep and needed someone to talk to. Fluffy can't support me 24/7 vou know.", He quickly hid a teddy bear behind his back. "We haff to let these people vo. We'll be arrested!"  Morris stopped winding the rope and glanced confusedly at him, "I saw him with my own eyes, Varkov. I know what happened."  "The hairy man, that was just me!"  Morris stared blankly into his face. He looked utterly afraid. Then, he burst out laughing, "Hah, I get it Dmitri. You were hallucinating. You do it all the time." Dmitri suddenly realized he wasn't holding a teddy bear. In fact, in his hands lay a stick. "There really was a hairy man, you were just hallucinating."  Indeed, Dmitri did have problems with hallucinations, however, he was telling the complete truth.   Leaves ruslted.  "There must be another one.", said Morris. Then he realized the rustling was from leaves under him. He looked down to find the man coming to and sitting up.  "Awwww. What happened.", said the man 2 seconds before he noticed the raggy, towering hobo before him.

      Morris creeped out the water. He stepped carefully over the branches on the ground near the pond. There was a fairly-good sized rock about maybe 3 feet away. He crept toward it.  "What are you doing?", whispered Dmitri.  "Shhhh." He picked up the rock. Another branch broke not too far away. "Take this, Hairy Man!". The rock was hurled into the air. It flew past the trees, and toward the noise.  "Dewww!", A loud, raspy, moan came from the trees.  "Bingo!",Morris started to jump up and down.  "Morris. Morris, 'ere vas no hairy ma-", started Dmitri.  "Come on." Morris dashed into the woods. Dmitri watched as Morris dragged the unconscious body of a man in his mid-forties. The man had gelled-back, brown hair and oval glasses. He was wearing a green sweater and brown khaki pants. He looked like a Wall Street whiz Kid.  "C'mon, Varkov, help me tie him up!"  "Vhat? Listen Morris, 'ere was no hairy man!"  "Well obviously. I guess the moon mad him look like he was hairy.", as Dempsey spoke, he was tieing the man's arm to the bench with a wound-string rope.  "Stewie? Stewie are you there.", a woman was calling from the nearby trees.  Morris stood quickly, grabbed a large rock and hurled it into the trees.  "Ahhhhgggg!", a high pitched voice emitted from the woods.

           Mikey says that my blog is full of spelling errors. It's not I checked.       Yesterday my relatives came over and my 5 year old cousin, Megan(I think thats how it's spelled.), was complaining about wanting to go in the pool so I told her she couldn't because she didn't have a swimsuit. Next thing I know she's butt-naked trying to open the door. DISCUSTING!!!      Today I was in the Memorial Day parade and the band leader wanted me to play cymbal. He gave us the music 5 minutes before the parade so we didn't read the music and just improvised. WE SUCKED!!      Yesterday I got an awesome idea. I would write a book in a blog and add a little every day so here it is: http://morrisdempsey.blogspot.com

      Hi. I am Pat Leonard, author of such books as  The So-far Unnamed Book  and  The Rise and Fall of Morris Dempsey . I like to add emotion to my stories.

So, I will give  You  the power to choose an emotion for future characters in my sci-fi story. However, all I'm going to tell u is there name.

He said, "You giving me this is just like if you gave me a snowball. I'll press the wrong button." Wow. God I hate old people. Dog.  Today I ordered Simpsons season 4. Lets see how many more seasons is that than Mikey has. Oh yeah, 4.  The reason I haven't posted in a while is because of finals.

      I kept track and this date 1 year ago I had a kid with a seal. It happened at Gillians. There was a machine that told you what your kids would look like. Mikey and Greg had a couple and I had one with a seal and one with a supermodel. The supermodel kid looked exactly like Frank Valenti so that's what I called him. The seal/Pat thing I called Bahivan!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

      Mikey wants me to talk about the racoon part, so here it goes. During the mem. day parade there was a dead racoon on the side of the road and a humongus blood stain in the middle of the road. For Field Band we are supposed to walk in a straight line. So I was forced to walk in the stain.  Not much happened today. Goodbye. I'm God.
