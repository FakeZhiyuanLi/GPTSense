Please try to get away frome those nasty burp brains and leave me another post, Stoney. Your Mama wants to see you. This time don't let those clumsy klutzes near my little garbage can.   It may cause you to disappear again. Ah hem.

       urlLink    Oh My!! Is it really you, Stoney? I never thought I'd see you again. I see those nasty dingo's at least taught you something. I din't know dingo's had computers. Please come and see your long lost Mama. I want to get a good look at you. Just follow the trail of meaty bones I've left  for you in the forest-but don't tell the dingo's! You and I both know what greedy little lard-asses they are. Love Mama

      'UGH, UGH, UGH.'she heaved a huge sigh and realized why she had chosen dreamonmissy as her name. 'They are almost always just out of reach--dreams. If only.' she thought, over and over.  She had been applying for jobs for herself and her partner all over the globe despite the fact that they had a very well paying job to go to in just 2 weeks. However, the whole point of exploring other avenues was the same goal most of us have-to make more money- hopefully at a nicer camp, maybe a different country for some adventure? She had applied to so many places-in her partners name, since he has the ticket-the process of applying became a job in itself. Okay, a kind of obssesive job with seemingly no purpose as no company had really bitten. Just when she was ready to give up and concentrate more on working out and preparing to leave for their camp job the long awaited, e-mail that never arrived, arrived. "Oh, of course," she breathed at her shrunken down golden retriever that looked a lot like a yorkie. Okay, it is a yorkie. "Princess! Who would have guessed?" It was a job she never really thought she'd luck into, living for free on an island on the west coast of B.C. where she could watch whales in her spare time. She'd have plenty of that since it was a 40 hour work week, instead of the 12 hour a day, 7 days a week type of job she was heading to the bush for-because of the money. That's where the UGH came in. The money. She knew her partner would never go for it. They were basically offering half of what they would make on the GORGEOUS island. She had researched the island all day, ignoring the money thing, hoping they would come up with a better offer. 'Geez, the marina had mountains behind, an ocean in front and WHALES!' she thought again, and again. All day she dreamt of the all that it would be. 'A lighthouse.." she'd always loved lighthouses. 'Diving, sailing..' though she likely wasn't brave enough. But mainly, she couldn''t stop dreaming about having that vast, mysterious, changing, beautiful blue ocean stretched out in front of her every wonderful day. Her partner had been up north at a temporary job so she had to wait for his call in the morning to get the answer she already knew was coming but couldn't help trying to think of a way to gloss over the money thing and ever so cunningly plant the picture of it all in his mind. ' He could come around-not. Dream on Missy.

      Hi all. Found this site and figured it would be a good way to keep in touch with the real world while I'm stuck in the northern bush. Not gone yet but will be soon! Whenever I can, I'll be here to give you all a taste of the remote camp life. I'm sure it will sound a lot like a soap opera since camp dwellers all become intertwined in each others lives, being stuck together for so long. However, any similarity to actual people living or seemingly dead is purely coincidental. From here on in this is a work of fiction. Pick a bush - any bush (by Fort Nowhere) and that's where this takes place.   wink, wink  :) The next time you see me I won't be here - I'll be there.

      i've never done this before,and although there is exorbitant amounts of caffine pumping through my weak and frail carcuss, i cannot think of anything interesting to say, for it is 2:30am and i'm tired.i'm sure you guessed that i'm not really a town sherriff,in reality i am only a night shift working school janitor who has a few weeks off since it's summertime. thank God for that. thank God for weekends too.but anyways,this time off is making me want more time off.i'm investigating Jamaica as a potential travel spot,so if anyone out there knows anything about jamaica, feel free to give me some tips.well, the powerful effect of this coffee seems to be wearing off,so i better pry my cold and shaky fingertips off this keyboard and stumble into bed, sincerely and wearily,  its all gunsmoke

      Did I hear an irritating voice from my past that sounds alot like my Ma? I couldn't hear you over the constant pings and whirs coming from my never ending coffee pot. Of course, the cowboy songs in the background don't help. Heh, Heh, Heh. Stoney
