      yes, i went to Starbucks for lunch, i'm so buzzed.   im so much more relaxed now. and the cashier was the NICEST lady ever! She's an asset to Jefferson Road Starbucks. She's kind of like my dealer i guess.

      Starbucks is my heroin. Really. Even whan I'm drinking a Starbucks (yes, i use the work like that) I'm thinking about drinking more Starbucks. I just crave my triple grande soy caramel macchiato every waking moment. Its actually a little scary. This morning, waiting in line to order and then waiting AGAIN for the barista to make my tasty beverage was killing me. There's this awkwardness before i get my fix that makes me feel like a caged monkey, I can't stand it, and i wish it didnt affect me so much, but i can't help it! Now I need another one. All of this talk of the SB has me all riled up.   "I feel like and addict must feel when he feens." - Alicia Keys, "Dragon Days"  Sing it, girl. Sing it.

      Whoa, I just got to spend an hour ouside in the grass, on a beautiful, sunny day. I alternated between just lying and relaxing and reading "The Catcher In The Rye". No, I've never read it before. I'm trying to avoid carbs.  I wanna go play outside! Since I can't do that, i guess, i'll just enjoy what I can. :)

      But then I got to work and everyone said i did a great job with the breakfast spread! That felt really good.   After all that schvetzing I got some appreciation. Sometimes I feel like i'm starving for validation and just wanting to feel like I matter. Kinda sad when people praising your bagel-buying is just about the nicest thing you hear all week.  Ah, modern life.

      So its my day to bring in breakfast to the office today, which is a whole lot more stressful than buying bagels should be. PLUS, i woke up late which sucks and sort of threw off the morning schedule. BUT i ended up buying 2 and a half dozen bagels, 2 packs of muffins, a dozen bagels, 3 tubs of cream cheese and a tub of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter Light. And then the cashier was grumpy! Come on, smile for your $5.15 an hour.

      I just met Chris, Nick and Nicole for lunch at Pizza Hut. Rather I should say, the lunch  buffet . I remember it being a whole lot better. I didnt eat any salad because the vegetables were terribly under-ripe.  They were so young that Michael Jackson what hovering over the cherry tomatoes.   So I stuck with the pizza/breadsticks angle, and i gotta tell you, it just isnt what it used to be.   Shame on thee, Pizza Hut. Shame!  well, i'm glad i got that out of my system. I'm going to stick with my non-buffet-eating lifestyle.

      Last nite after work was the most fun time ever. I left work, ran home to get changed, and went to Jillians to meet Chris(Chrissy), Nicole(Canole), James(Jenna Jameson), Pete(Patsy), Kevin(Kevina, i think?), Rico (Ricola/Grundle), and Antonio(Tuba). I was playing the role of Norma Jean. We all had pseudonyms on the electronic scorers. I got there just in time for bowling. It took me a few frames to get into the game, since I haven't bowled in maybe 5 years. But then I got a whole lot better and even started getting a few strikes (holla) which meant i got a few shots (holla x2) and the game got a whole lot more fun.

      trite, but applicable.  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You

      i'll be true, i'll be useful... i'll be cavalier...i'll be yours my dear. and i'll belong to you... if you'll just let me through. this is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. and this is wonderful as loving goes, this is tailor made. whats the sense in waiting? and i said i've gotta be honest i've been waiting for you all my life. for so long i thought i was asylum bound, but just seeing you makes me think twice. and being with you here makes me sane, i fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side. you've got wits...you've got looks, you've got passion but are you brave enough...

      Okay, I realize that my blog has been a tad morose lately, so I'm going to start collecting a lot of funny things that i hear, think, and say.   "Go back to your home on whore island." - Anchorman "I pooped a hammer." - Anchorman "It's so hot. Milk was a bad choice." - Anchorman  "Wanna have a jumping on one foot contest?" "No, we'll get in trouble. I'm a goody-goody." - Me to Sarah at work today  Walking out of the office with our new marketing kit, holding it like a waiter with a tray, talking to Kelly: "Excuse me, Madam, did you order the veal?" "No, the t-shirt. Hold the baloons."  more to come

      As life gets longer, awful feels softer,  and it feels pretty soft to me.  And if it takes shit to make bliss,  well I feel pretty blissfully.   If life's not beautiful without the pain,  well I'd just rather never ever even see beauty again.

      I bet you wish you knew what time it is - And it's clear that you don't understand a love that required fewer words - it's been a while since we spoke. But there's still hope. If we materialise the myth - never trivialise the kiss. It feels like there's no fire left in your eyes. and this is how love dies.  -Damon Gough  i wish i didnt find that so affecting right now.

      And if i knew the answers i would tell you now Just what would be the chances that i could show you how If i knew where all the tears were coming from Add up all the days that you've been gone This is that new song I told you about 20 years ago  Do you know what true romance is and could you show me now  Just what would be the chances that i could tell you how If i knew where all the tears were flowing to Guide them to a river where i'd swim with you downstream This is that old dream i told you about 20 years ago  And could you hold me now...

      AWESOME WEEKEND. I miss it a lot. but my housemate Tim is a douche and we don't have Digital Cable OR internet at my house right now because apparently he didnt pay the bill that we gave him the money for, and apparently he lied about it and told us it was some interruption in the service due to some Time-Warner phone service test. He's such a dickbag.  But my triple grande soy caramel macchiato is delicious this morning!  I miss Chris. A lot.
