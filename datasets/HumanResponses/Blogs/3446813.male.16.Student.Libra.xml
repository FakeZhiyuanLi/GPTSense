      woo! got my yearbook finally, geez i've been waiting for ages to get this mother f-ing thing and now that i have it, i'll get everyone to sign!!! mwhahahhaha! yup, junior year i didnt pick up my yearbook on the designated date and   BAM!   they're all gone and i couldnt pick up another one until after the seniors had already left *tear*. so ,i, in effect had 1/2 the signs i coulda gotten and i couldnt get any senior signatures. in addition to all this maddness my picture was in the freshman section,  AGAIN!  so now this junior year yearbook has to be my redeeming highschool milestone.  on a side note, i'm still not goin to prom, yea i know *tear*. but i am going to a separate  par-tay ...in a sense, so i guess i'll have some fun. though its really hurtin that im gonna miss my last chance to dance and have fun with my senior buddies. but you know, thats a whole nother reason why i need to get my yearbook signed by all the seniors and underclassmen that i know...and i guess anyone i dont know, as long as they wanna sign.  umm what else...oh anthong is gonna apply for a  urlLink job  at  best buy , according to his plan filled with "wishful thinking" he'll have enough for paying off band and parts for a new computer. all i can say is good luck anthony, cuz its not gonna happen.  on a foresight type note, im gonna have work + school's summer school + chaffey college summer school + comp summer camp + possibly band camp all during summer. yup a lotta shiznit to be worrying about, hopefully none of it clashes, or else im gonna have to decdide which is more important, and they're all basically equally important, so i wouldnt know what to choose...anyways the rambling should end.  well peace out fo sho

      now that i figured out how to basically use this, i guess i'll start using this in concert with my original sub-profile to relate the "coolness of tim" to all my friends and admiring fans. yup becuz obviously one sub-profile wasn't enough to cater to all my friend impressing needs and such.  anyways, the school year is coming to a close with a lotta things still up in the air. my grades still have to make like a hairy baboon and climb. still have to get my summer school schedule at college figured out. then there is marching band, hmm, one can only guess if i'll get in or not, i hope i do. anyways, i wont be able to go to prom, grr, friends and their deceptiveness, tricking me out of going...  umm, aside from that i still got some unfinished social business to tend to (cant finish the year with tainted events uncleared in my life). especially the stuff my friends kinda screwed up for me. heh not that im blaming them for anything or anything like that...  at work i am replacing an old lady who used to work with the little kids, but in a sense i am "demoted" *sigh*. Though the constant interaction with little kids keeps me awake, i guess its the principle of the thing...or something. though this is unrelated, i've noticed im flat broke and i need more money to survive. heh, though my little excursions with friends to tapioca express and what not dont help the situation at all.  well i'd keep chatting but i have a math test to study for and a lab to do and yes, they are all important, cuz they are both for classes i wish to get a higher grade in, so everything counts.   peace out, a-town  ps did you notice that i didnt give a crap about capitalizing and punctuation and junk, like i did in the first entry? i told you it would happen  well, peace out, thunderclap   HEY!

      So I'm just typing this up wondering what it'll look like when I actually publish this...yup...just typin.       So I guess if this turns out cool I'll start writing more and this may actually become a more updated source of "Tim's Coolness" updates then my subprofile, because their servers are totally unreliable, not to mention slow. Hmm yup, well I guess for the sake up linking the two places up I'll just give you a link to my sub-profile, let you decide for yourself how things are. Well yea here it is  urlLink my old sub-profile  enjoy.       On a sidenote I guess I realize that I'm totally going out on some tangent using Blogger, something I have never heard of until 2 minutes ago when I just happened to come across it surfing the internet. Yea since I'm asian and all guess I "should" be using Xanga or something, but you know, I'm a non-conformist, so sue me.  For the sake of this being the first entry, I actually went through the whole thing and took out internet slang and capitalized all letters needing to be capitalized. Feel lucky that I am providing you people with such luxury. So yea, don't expect such elegant entries from now on out!

      Well let's see all thats happened thus far from the last update...i dont really know what i wrote for the last entry so i might repeat a few things, but you know...who cares.  Okay first of all im in band! yup its true after a little negotiating i'm in band, though not very high ranking, who cares?! im in band and i get to go to grand nationals and state champs and the whole schiznit! yup so cool, though its like a probationary membership since i can be pulled out in an instant by my parents if i dont plan and finish my eagle project in time. but its summer, im sure i got enough time to complete an eagle project...  on another note, instead of going to computer tech camp in silicon valley *cough*nerd*cough* i get to go to hawaii! woo its so cool cuz, i've never been there and now im gonna just jet over for some fun in da hawaiin sun for 10 days.  of course both of these perks comes at a cost. i have to quit my job during august and beyond because i wont have time to fit it all into my schedule. well technically besides august i can do, but my parents feel that that will overload my schedule and not allow me to maintain high-ish grades if i spend my time working on top of band-ing, school-ing, and other stuff-ing...so yea, gotta leave my friends at work *tear* though many of them are going off to college anyways...well a lot of the cool ones...  on the topic of work today brian and anthony also applied to get a job where i work. though its funny cuz they took like 40 min over the recommneded time limiit, which was about 20 minutes...sooo they went over and took about an hour to complete a simple skills assesment test. in any case i hope they get their job for the only amount of time they can work...lik one month, cuz like me they have to quit in august anyways.  i think thats about it...oh and if you ppls are wondering about my website...which im sure you're not, its not really under construction right now. i mean i had to build and maintain a site for a certain purpose and that purpose has been served so now i gotta turn my attention to like...doin other important stuff, and i'll update my site when i can, or i feel not so lazy.  ummm and on another tangent im taking english 11 cp during summer school.   BLEH!!!  anyhow its easy so far, only been watching a movie on the crucible and taking study guide notes from it, instead of actually reading the book...i must say a smart teacher *cough*. anyways i hate that, but yea who wouldnt, damnit i shoulda done better during the school year...well whatever, peace out my ppls.

      I'm creating a new website, its totally crazy. So i really wont have time to update anything here. sorry all you fans of my writing *cricket chirps*...well come visit my site anytime (though its still being built) its all good. well the site would be  urlLink at tripod!   cya there fans o' mine!  ps i seem to have the same sn everywhere i go...i guess thats good...but then again very unoriginal. i've had this sn since like 7th grade, is it time for a change? i guess i possibly might be, since so many other ppl get new sns all the time. even my site's name is in my name (coolgi4) well...lets just hope it helps anyone searching for me find me easier cuz thats what im here for...i guess...to be found...or something... SHUT UP!!! MY ILLOGICAL THINKING DOES NOT NEED TO BE CRITICIZED!!!  *runs off crying*... *in a masculine sort of way*

      well school is finally over an man am i glad, hahaha...or am i?  i mean i am glad that there is no more freakin ap or anything to put up with cuz that was horrid, or at least most of it was. there is also no more waking up early to go to school and things like that (i woke up at 12 today). so presumably now i should be livin the good life with no school and a bunch of free time on my hands, but then there are a couple negatives i guess.  all my friends are in band (well almost all of them) so it goes without sayin i wont have much company when i want to go do things during this lovely time of the year. summer...or at least the beginning of summer marks the entrance of school report cards, which if they arent good are gonna bar me from joining band, which sucks. thus i'll be at home withering away while all my friends go off to practice in the summer heat and then head off to grand nationals and state champs and what not *tear*.  lets see besides that i have a big to do list i need to do now...well actually its only 6 bullets worth of stuff i need to do but whos countin? some of which include doin driver's trainin, which i guess could end up being quite fun...hmm well i guess its all good...or something  well its summer i gotta go enjoy it, dont know how, but i will.

      heh wanna know what my dream is about? well lets say its about a girl i had a crush on a while back. but then after awhile i lost interest in her after i started with someone else. but then after it was broken off with this new person i was goin life single, which isnt half bad, but anyways i was mainly concentrating on studying like a mofo to raise grades...i think they turned out worse than ever compared to my past 10yrs of school but better than i expected for this semester compared with 1st semester. anyways with my mind pre-occupied i just didnt really think about girls, until this dream. it re-inflamed my crush on this girl from the recent past (?, a little late i might add since it did happen a day b4 school's end.   anyway it had me and this girl i like sitting together for one reason or another and after some talking i leaned in to kiss her (she didnt slap me back so at least i know my subconcious is on my side) and it was great. then it ended up with us two (how you say) getting closer. hehe then i woke up like at 7:25 freakin late for class pretty unprepared for the finals that lay ahead of me.  well now school is over and im bored as heck, but my plans are to pick up a ton of school work on monday, lets see how that works out.  on a sidenote i wasnt able to get my yearbook signed by everyone i wanted *boo hoo coo coo kachoo* but anyways yea...

      wow i had the coolest thing, at the weirdest moment in time...  i was chugging along at 3am-ish or somethin on math hw studying for the final (hopefully i got an A on it, which would get me an A in the class). anyways i was goin along until i happened to drift off and fall asleep... then of all times in that most stressful situation did i start dreaming. i mind you i havent had dreams in a while since all those late nights make my brain too tired to dream for me or something...anyways i havent had any in a while. the strange thing is its not any normal dream, but a dream about something i havent been thinking a lot about lately.  now for the longest time i've been only thinking of how to raise my grades like a mo-fo and how to get into band. so i guess this dream of mine was to take my mind off things or to fantasize or to prophesize or soemthing...but in any case it was cool and i was very pleased. *pats brain on the back*  yup...now all i gotta do is take care of my french and chem final and im set wiff my semester grades. lets just hope i can pull this schiznit off...o man so scared.  anyways, back to studying

      hehe the school year is coming to a close and all the projects are being shoved into the little AP kid's hands at once, oh is it hard.  So it turns out one of these projects is a gc, which i might add must be the funnest projects to do ever in the history of school. anyways in my venture of filming this gc, there was a certain scene to pull of MIB style kick in door scenes as seen in the aforementioned movies. anthony graciously volunteered his house for this scene and basically the whole gc (maybe cuz his house has never been used b4 as opposed to my house which has been in 2 or 3 videos.  anyways, in our little venture of kicking in doors, yours truly might have kicked the door too hard (i must have MIB blood within me) and punched a hole in the inside wall with the door handle. hehe it'll be in the gc bloopers, to my embarrassment i guess. so now anthony's parents are rightfully really pissed at me and want me to fix and/or repair the whole that i have so artfully crafted into the architecture of his house. though i must say splitting the cost with my gc group would be mighty nice, i mean i did do it for the better of our grades right? so yea...  besides all of this madness i still got a bean trees project, history project, french final, trig/pre-cal final, comp tech final, and chem final b4 the close of the school year. so this should be fun, see if i'll indeed end up in band or if i'll just end up working out at the gym or whatever during summer becuz i'd have nothing better to do (like tami evnin the x-colorguard). so yea...fun stuff this year is winding up to become...

      it seems that time is running out for everything nowadays...though i guess its only logical since technically it is running out in a constant and perpetual manner. but in any matter, what im trying to point out is, is that holy crap junior year is almost over and im gonna be a senior and not in band *tear*.  yup as of now i have no idea how i could possibly join band, time is running out, because parent meetings and stuff are over but if i could just convince my parents by band camp im sure i can still be accepted in. i mean Brian from the BATmen is a Drum Major for crying out loud! not to mention th eA from BATmen Anthony is section leader of the *cough* flutes *cough* which is crazy because being chosen for any kind of leadership position is crazy! anyways while this is going on i stand by helpless not in band and all...  since the school year is winding down there is virtually no time to improve grades, thoguh math is practically and A! but chem will surely stay a C, awww... Anyways *cough* after bombing that lab practical *cough* im more than sure thats how its gonna turn out...  now that i think about it, i guess now that i dont have band i dont have any extra-cirricular activities...aww boo hoo coo koo kachoo for me. yea...that'll surely look good on my college applications, with that big  slacker  stamp across my transcripts, how depressing.  on a lighter and darker note i heard ppl had a lotta fun at prom. though i have heard first hand the anal craptacularness of our school administration. one of my friends from comp tech class told me that he arrived 8 minutes late his whole party mr melendez and mrs yarboi wouldn't let them in  ON PROM!  It was his senior prom too! thought hings basically turned out all-right sort of when it was found out they had a kickass chauffer. first he argued with mr melendez about how he's ruining the kids lives and scarring them for life and junk up to a point where mr yarboi caome out. then both our wonderful administrative school leaders started threatening to sue if he didnt scram, so they left. the driver was nice enough to give each guy $20 and drop them off at down town Disney! after they got bored there, the driver used his contacts to get them a private party at a marina club or whatnot where they got free drinks and all. but all in all i guess it still sucks they werent allowed to make it into their own senior prom. oh well, what can ya do?  yup well got studying to do, cya
