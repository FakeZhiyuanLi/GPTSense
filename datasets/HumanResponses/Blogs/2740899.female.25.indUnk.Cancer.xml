      It is just before 12:30 PM, and Chris hands me a cup of coffee in a blue mug with a moon on it that  someone gave to me for my 16th or 17th birthday.  It's funny the way that these things traveled with me from home to college to Honolulu.  With our meeting with the potential investor only a few hours away, I am re-crunching all of the numbers, checking my formulas, and wondering what to put in the "Market" section.  Chris hates the nice normal mugs in the cupboard--the ones that come with saucers.  He usually uses my Princeton Coffee House mug.  It is the only mug that we have that is white, and he thinks that the blue ones distort his view of the coffee.  Our first offer on the bakery space was rejected yesterday.  We had to up our numbers and reduce our requests, and we are still not sure that we are going to get it.  It makes planning for this meeting more than a bit difficult.  And we just want to be started already, opened already.  We want to build a fire in the oven, mix huge batches of dough, and bake.

      Our meeting was cancelled this afternoon—leaving me with a folder full of projections and nothing to do with them.  It was rescheduled, so hopefully it will still come together.  But, as a bonus, I became an Excel Expert today.

      This morning the alarm went off at 7:30 am, and to my wild and sleepy amazement, Chris got out of bed, turned off the alarm, and went to shower.  I, however, stayed in bed for a bit longer before getting up to check over last night’s calculations before our meeting with our accountant.    Honestly, it feels very strange to have an accountant.  Travel coffee mugs in hand, we arrived at the office as close 9 am as we were ever going to be.  We sat in the waiting area for a few minutes and thumbed through an issue of  urlLink Bon Appetit  with a mention of Chris’s old boss at  urlLink Trio , Grant Achatz.  A few moments later, we met our accountant, and he began an hour-long lecture on the different forms our company could take and the financial repercussions for each: LLC, S-Corp, or Corporation.  Apparently, LLCs are fairly new to the state of Hawaii, so it is unclear what sort of liability protections are offered.  We blinked a lot and tried to interrupt him a few times to point out the specifics of our case, but I think that the lecture was unavoidable.    He referred us to a few attorneys, and even offered to come along with us in order to be a part of the discussion on the final decision of our legal form.  He also recommended QuickBooks, which was helpful.  But both Chris and I left the meeting feeling angry and it took us a little while to figure out why.  Neither one of us appreciated being treated as though we were twelve, as though we would have walked into an accountant’s office without some numbers, a plan, a size in mind.  We were lectured on the tax benefits of a corporation if the profits were over $399,000 per year.  This does not apply to us.  And he ignored us when we tried to point it out.  We were there for specific information—specific to us information—the rest of it could have been gleaned from books and the internet.  In fact, for us, much of it already was.   So we went home, fuming and annoyed, and feeling sort of powerless in the face of this huge world of things that we do not understand the vocabulary for but do not fail to comprehend the meanings.  And then we tried to deal with the flour.  Chris purchased  urlLink Artisan Baking Across America  a few months ago, and really liked the story of Thom Leonard and his bread.  Imagine Chris’s surprise when he finally received an email back from potential flour supplier  urlLink Heartland Mill , and the email itself was from Thom Leonard.   Here’s the tricky part: how do we know that it is same the Thom Leonard?  It could be some other guy, with the same name, who happens to be in a related business—high quality, and even organic flours, ideal for artisan bread baking—as this other guy who baked bread and was featured in a book.   This also leads to the question, are we, perhaps, bread groupies?  In a response to Mr. Leonard’s email, Chris covered business and then asked, “Are you  the  Thom Leonard?”  Mr. Leonard wrote back that he didn’t know that there was a  the  Thom Leonard.  Chris, at this point, was a little unsure of what to do.  So, he titled his reply, “Artisan Flour Across America” and left it alone.  Mr. Leonard wrote, “Oh,   that  , Thom Leonard.”  But he still did not answer the question.  Aside from the identity confusion, Mr. Leonard has been incredibly helpful.  A major problem is going to be the size of our production.  We are planning to use about 5100 pounds of flour per month, which isn’t nearly enough to make it efficient to bring in flour from Kansas. At that rate, it would take us about eight months to go through a container of flour.  Of course, we could order a half-container, but that is still four months and a lot of storage space for a small bakery—oh yeah, and the space would have to be temperature controlled.  And so, with Heartland in the back of our minds, we have started working with the Bakery consultant at  urlLink HFM .  He worked at Bay Breads and even worked on the  urlLink Panya  sourdough—which leads us to the problem of the day.  We don’t want a Bakery consultant working on our recipe.  We have a recipe, and as I have written before, people who try it, love it.  This is why we are opening a bakery—but the guy, though very helpful, seems fairly certain that we are doing it all wrong.  I think that he tried to fire Chris when Chris told him that we are hand mixing, hand shaping, all (only) 240 loaves.  We have a theory here, we have—I guess what are amounting to beliefs—on how this should be done in our own bakery.  And we are sticking with it.  We have decided to take the high road, and to bring along a bit of bribery when we meet the consultant to pick 50 lbs worth of sample flour.  We are going to bring a loaf of LBH Bread.  That does it for everyone else, and I expect it to work at HFM, too.  Chris picked up  urlLink Andy’s  for lunch and met me at our friend Sarah’s house.  We hung out and had a lovely afternoon until Chris’s dad called with car trouble—and so Chris’s improving day got worse.  All the way to  urlLink dinner time ,  But now, we are hanging out at home, listening to music, and debating whether or not to stay up all night for the fun of it.  The meeting with the potential investor is tomorrow—hopefully it will be a better day.

      Just to change things up a bit, neither one of us set the alarm clock last night.  Honestly, I think that Chris did like the running log of just how many times we failed on the alarm clock front.  Not setting the alarm was very nice.  And having had no specific time to judge ourselves  made the morning fairly guilt-free and lovely.    Chris made  urlLink  the coffee  and we hung out a bit before heading to  urlLink Minato's  to join a customer-turned-friend  urlLink Sun-Ki  and a really cool former restaurateur named Eddie for lunch.  The four of us sat and talked for two hours about the bakery, and about the direction of food in Hawaii.  Eddie once co-owned a portuguese restaurant in Honolulu for ten years in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  His perspective was clearly bottom lined based, and he was happy to know that we were thinking about the bottom line a bit, too.  He asked us questions about production numbers, materials, and he was very interested in the functioning of the oven.  Chris explained for a while how the heat retained oven works--it heats up the chamber until the bricks are even and then after the fire dies and the ashed are raked out, the dough goes directly on the brick and is cooked by the emanating heat.  Chris even talked about the oven at  urlLink Au Vieux Four  in Tours, which was built in 1641.  It was an animated discussion.  Standing outside of the restaurant, as we parted, we shook hands and Eddie told us that we are infectious and that he is excited for us.  Most of all, he hopes that the way that we feel about food spreads.  I hope so too, not just because of our business, but because I would love to enjoy the food and restaurants that such a growing sentiment is likely to produce.  Chris and I walked to the car, holding hands on our way out of the parking lot.  After lunch I headed out to buy a card for  urlLink my roommate Michael  from  urlLink college .  He emailed me this morning to tell that he and his wife are expecting their first baby. I feel like I have been card shopping a lot lately.  In the store, surrounded by the scent of fake flowers and spices wafting from the candle section, I started to think about the way that my mother stockpiled cards when we were living in Greece so that she could send them to our friends and family in the States for all sorts of occasions.  And then it reminded me of the recent Hallmark commercials, suggesting the same sort of behavior.  It would be sort of appealing to not have to run to the card store twice in one week—but on the other hand, I would much rather pick out a card that is not just appropriate for the event but also for the recipient.    Maybe this is some of the same appeal in our feelings about food and even about the bread, the feelings that Eddie found to be so infectious?  The bread is a very special product, we both feel it.  And almost everyone we talk to about it feels the same way.  This is natural levain bread, and when we build the oven, it will be hearth baked.  Just thinking about it, I start to understand what Eddie was talking about.  But I just cannot put my finger on it.  Tonight has been so busy that I just now realized that Chris and I forgot to eat dinner.  I was drafting eight pages of preliminary projections to prepare us for our 9 am meeting with an  urlLink accountant-to-the-stars  tomorrow.  He has promised to explain all of the different ways that we can set up the finances in an LLC, and we are hoping that he can recommend a lawyer.  And so the alarm is set for 7:30 am.

      I just received a lovely email from our friend  urlLink Lance , who is making us very happy by moving back to Hawaii from California later this week.    He wrote, "Have you thought of doing the suggested donations thing? Like $50 is a "Friend," $75 is an "Honorary Baker for the Day" or something? This is standard operating procedure in the world of literary magazines, it seems, though admittedly lit mags have nothing to do with cooking, and oh, no one ever donates (except when an editor dies)."  In honor of Lance's move, anyone who clicks on the little "Make A Donation" button to the right-hand side of the screen and makes a "donation" of $75 or more and wants to be named, will be listed on this site as an "Honorary Baker for the Day."  And just to be clear, by donation we mean that you give us money for nothing, no service, no product, no stock, no equity, nothing except the warm and happy feeling you will have when you help us on our way to the oven.

      Chris set the alarm last night for 6 AM.  We did not get up for hours, and when I finally stumbled out of bed, I headed for the kitchen and made  urlLink strong coffee .   I think that it has been hard to get up for the last few days just because the mornings have been sort of cool.  And these mornings are the only time when I get closer to memories of the heaviness of a down comforter weighing down my body in the tingling of the cold early morning air in  urlLink my mother’s house,  just before I snuck out of my room to turn up the heat.  We have a meeting on Thursday scheduled with a potential investor—even though we are moving away from the idea of having major investors at all.  I want to build a consortium of small investors so that we do not lose any creative control, but as I am entirely unsure as to how to pull this off, we are exploring other options.   And really, either way, we are going to need numbers on pretty paper.  And I have been good and actually working on a sort of quick draft of a business plan.  Today’s goal was to analyze our target market, based upon our assumptions on the make-up of our current following.    Now, I use the word following--but Chris has pointed out on more than one occasion that he doesn’t think that we can call it a  following .  We are on a first name basis with all of our customers—and with a 16 loaf limit, this should not be too surprising.  Over  urlLink lunch , I pointed out that we should try and keep this up, that we should try and follow  urlLink Chez Panisse  and have business contacts who are also friends.  Chris rightly reminded me that we do not live in Berkeley.  So I have changed my tune.  I think that we should have business contacts, purveyors, customers, who are all cousins, who are or will become family.  And Chris agreed.  And then I spent this afternoon pouring over census data, trying to figure out how many of which people in our possible initial markets there are on this island.  I have identified six initial target groups, from which I expect the word to spread after we get going full steam.  Those six are: 1) Foodies; 2) People who read widely for leisure, probably well educated, well traveled, professionals and academics; 3) People who practice or appreciate sustainable agriculture, health foods and healthy lifestyles; 4) Younger hip people who have some money to spend and who probably no longer live with their parents; 5) People with large families who will appreciate the value of a large loaf of high quality bread; and, 6) People who attend dinner parties.    I have a feeling that these are the sorts of categories that the potential investor isn’t really going to care about.  So, research shows that the  urlLink census web page  does not sort age specific data on level of education attained for the state of Hawaii or who is likely to go to a dinner party for that matter.  I did however find out that on  urlLink Oahu , I am one of 2,178 people of American Indian descent and one of 109,571 who have a Bachelor’s degree or higher.  In fact, 27.9 % of Oahu has a Bachelor’s degree or higher, whereas the percentage goes up to 31.1% in my neighborhood.  (As a reference, it is 24.4% for the rest of the country.)  But that is as far as the census got me, and without the funding to put a poll or a survey in the field, it is just going to have to do.  With these numbers behind me, now I just have to figure out how to write it, how to present it, and how to not be incredibly shy at the meeting on Thursday.  Instead, I am going to read a little about    urlLink Goya , finish my  urlLink Campari  and enjoy the rest of the evening.

      And I mean  urlLink Sunrise  in the  urlLink Norah Jones  sense--which is the ignoring-the-sun-rise sense.    Chris set the alarm clock last night for 7 PM.  He claims that it was not a subconscious thing.  I have my doubts.  So I woke up this morning cold and fuzzy behind my eyelids, listening to the sound of Chris stirring a coffee cup in the kitchen.  This is a much more pleasant first-thing-in-the-morning sound than the blaring of the lime green alarm clock on the short bookcase by the bed.  I woke up slowly, balancing my coffee cup on our slightly used and dirty copy of  urlLink The Bread Baker's Apprentice  while reading  urlLink the morning paper  and listening to Chris read aloud from  urlLink Bertolli's  "Letter to my Newborn Son" and then the introduction to the play Bertolli wrote wherein his wine interacts with the flavors of his meal.  In truth, I, of course, had mildly traumatic flashbacks to  urlLink Circe .  I find Bertolli's writing charming, and I partially credit  urlLink him  for getting the baking going.  Chris had  staged  at an  urlLink artisanal boulangerie  when we were in Tours, but he never really baked at home before being sucked in by Bertolli's prose on the bread making process.  And so here we are,  urlLink opening a bakery  with our own levain, our own recipe and method.  It is pretty amazing.  After coffee and Bertolli, instead of eating last night's  urlLink ciabatta , we went for the usual Sunday  urlLink lunch  with Chris's parents and talked over borrowing vs. investor strategies.  We've pretty much dropped the idea of hitting up a random restaurant mogul type cousin in Manilla for start-up money.  Instead, we are moving on to thinking about  urlLink Small Business Administration  backed loans... So now I have to regret dropping out of  urlLink UC Berkeley's Business for Arts, Sciences and Engineering  summer program in the summer before my fourth year at the  urlLink University of Chicago .  I am excited to develop and run this business, but I just don't have a grasp on the vocabulary that business types use.  So I am struggling along.  And yet, I am sitting here listening to  urlLink True Love Always'  album from 1998, pretty much ready to tackle the business plan.  Oh, and Chris, Ben and Scott (Team M) beat Kelsa, the other Emily and me (Team W) at  urlLink Trivial Pursuit  last night.  We clearly need a rematch.

      Chris set the alarm last night for 8 am.  That would have given us ample time to think about hitting  urlLink the KCC Farmer's Market  to pick up some of Jeanne Vana's  urlLink Big Wave Tomatoes  or for me to show up at the free Saturday morning  urlLink French Language Table  run by Hawaii's chapter of the amazingly far flung Alliance Francaise.    We didn't get up until almost noon, when we were forced to jump out of bed and pose on the couch with our laptops when Ben showed up--just to pretend that we had not been asleep since just after he went home last night.  He had stopped by on his way to  urlLink cover a baseball game , but had somehow left his house without shoes.  He tried on Chris's very professional  urlLink Birkis , but Ben's feet stuck out in the back of the shoes, so he was forced to run to Macy's for a proper newsman's brown shoes.  Hungry, and with our  urlLink stash of coffee  running too low for us to eat the leftover pancakes at home, we headed to  urlLink Kaka'ako Kitchen  to work numbers over an ahi sandwich and the mixed bbq plate.  So far it is looking like a possible 35% return, though probably more like 27%.  Running at Chris's full capacity, the bakery is starting to look like we might even be able to pay our bills while making the kind of bread we want to make the way we want to make it.  A staggering first estimate of $3400 per month on flour makes me look at the stuff a little differently tonight while Chris has his hands in yet another bowl full of flour, water, and a little bit of salt.  Our friends Angela and Grant had their second son late last year, and he had been having trouble breathing, but is doing better now.  We stopped by Border's to pick up a get well card and decided to get a copy of  urlLink Saveur ... I know he's not old enough to read, but with those two as his parents and  urlLink his particular namesake , I am going to assume that even as a newborn, baby Keller will at least enjoy the food-friendly pictures.  While we were at Borders, I checked out the Business section and finally found a book that didn't have some permutation of the word "Idiot" in the title.  Here's hoping that the  urlLink A Resource for Startups and Growing Businesses  has something useful between its covers.  Chris purchased Paul Bertolli's  urlLink Cooking By Hand , which was too expensive but thus far beautifully written.  I love that he cannot corroborate the Elizabeth David quote in the beginning--and after a quick look through our book shelf, neither can I.  Bertolli writes that Elizabeth David may have written that "Good cooking is trouble."  And he takes it as sort of a reference to the difficulties of cooking in a way that  urlLink Slow Food  people would appreciate.  I can understand that, given the way that we are making the bread.  Anyway, we just finished our dinner from  urlLink Olive Tree  along with a lovely bottle of Barbara d'Alba from Fujioka's.  We are sitting down to play Trivial Pursuit with Kelsa and Ben.  And maybe the other Emily and Scott will join us soon.  It's Saturday night in the Little Blue House, and I just hope that we don't end up playing Pictionary.  And since Kelsa just explained my color blindness to everyone else in terms of genetics, I think that I am going to be okay on Science and Nature questions!

      It is after 6 PM on Friday, and Chris hands me a list of possible wholesale accounts so that we can sound like we know something if we actually meet with the banker he spent an hour on the phone with this afternoon.  Some are already friends, like  urlLink Mariposa , and others are already interested, like  urlLink R. Field's  and  urlLink Diamond Head Market .  Others are cold calls--sort of a problem given the shyness factor.    Chris has already spoken to not one but two bankers today, one from First Hawaiian and our friend Ben's brother-in-law at the Bank of Hawaii.  First Hawaiian seems to be jumping at the opportunity (that is until they realize that we have nothing but a regularly broken-down 1997 two door Saturn to put up against a loan), which the guy at Bank of Hawaii thought was a little strange.  Actually, he told Chris that if First Hawaiian extends a loan, he wants the name of the banker to hand out to friends.    It is kind of crazy the way some people seem to jump on board for this... Of course, we still have absolutely no money in our nonexistent business banking account.  So that says something about "seeming to jump on board," I suppose.  Chris also talked with an equipment supplier about deck ovens in case we cannot raise the funds to build the oven.  We are looking at some Swedish oven, hoping we never have to buy it.  Chris has been like superman today with the phone calls, contractors fall at his feet and (before we tell them that we have no money) tell us how excited they are to consider fitting us into their busy schedules.  More good news is that Chris did some research, and while a cord of Kiawe wood (4x4x8, so big that it would take two pickup trucks to move) costs over $400, it should take us about a month to go through a whole cord.  Someone in Ottawa even claims that the cost to bake bread is only 2 Canadian cents per loaf.  But that is Canada, and they have lots of trees... And last I checked?  They probably weren't in the middle of the Pacific.  I guess that I have lots of phone calls to make tomorrow.

      And so, here we are, standing at the beginning of some pretty scary stuff.  Last week, we trademarked the name for the bakery, got a tax license, and now we are fielding questions from potential flour purveyors, firewood suppliers, and masons.  How in the world did we get here?  I think that it was October when I put up  urlLink The Little Blue House  web site one afternoon when I was bored and procrastinating.  Somehow, the mention of natural levain artisan bread being made in Honolulu caught someone's eye and we started fielding emails and requests and  orders .  No one seemed to care that we were doing this out the house and that we didn't have a price list because we had never sold the bread before.  And yet, we ended up in a 10 am meeting not much later, armed with samples for Karen and Doug at Mariposa.  Instead of giving us polite advice, they asked when we could get going on a slightly larger scale.  Now, we have to secure a space, pay the security deposit, hire a contractor, find fire bricks, a mason, and some sort of insurance in case something happens to Chris's arms (handmixing and hand shaping all of the dough for hopefully 240 loaves...).  Oh yeah, and money.  Lots and lots of money.  Like $70,000.

      Chris set the alarm last night for 7:30 am.  He turned it off at around 8 am, and fell back into bed.  For Chris, the rain lulled him back to sleep.  But for me, I noticed that the sun never became brighter today than it was at 8 am.  Indeed, the rain has been so loud, that after the real estate agent called this morning, I couldn't fall back asleep.  Though maybe the reason I couldn't fall back asleep, or think in a straight line, was the call itself.  The contract is ready to be signed for the space, so this weekend, we will review it, try not to scream, and sign on for five years.  This is really, really happening.  After the real estate agent, I tried to call our accountant to the stars, who hasn't called us since our meeting with him last month--but there was no answer.  The rain has been a major news story here, so I gave up trying to call all people at their offices at around 10 am.  Few people were going to leave their houses, brave the flooded off-ramps of H1 and go to work.  Instead of phone calls, I turned on  urlLink this morning's opera selection , made  urlLink coffee  and sat in the kitchen admiring the grey sky through the slatted window.  This afternoon, Chris bundled up in his jacket and little black hat from our winters in Chicago and went shopping for all the makings of a feast for our Oscar gathering on Sunday.  He is making food from Brazil, and came home complaining about the cost of pigs' feet.  I have spent my time curled up and watching  urlLink L'Homme du Train , which seemed like a good rainy day movie.  The rain is supposed to continue all weekend, which is sort of nice.  I love the rain.  And we have the luxury, at least until mid-April, of living in a beautiful little blue house that is raised slightly off the ground.

      It turns out that our landlord wants her house back, so instead of renewing our lease, we have to go apartment hunting.  We have 45 days to find a new place to live--in a town where our good friend Ben has been looking for an apartment since June!  So March 15th we get into the bakery, and April 15th we move into a new place to live.  I think that we are going to need boxes.  Lots and lots of boxes.

      Last night, Chris set the alarm for 6:30 am. We did not get up until later, when we had to juggle real estate agent phone calls, Chris's parents calling to let us know that they had arrived safely back in town, and a guy from the health department returning yesterday's phone call.   According to the friendly guy from  urlLink the Department of Health , we need at least ten major things: 1) mop bucket; 2) a way to get rid of dirty mop bucket water; 3) no exposed pipes or other debris falling from the ceiling; 4) easy to clean floor, walls, and ceilings; 5) proof of pest control; 6) easy to clean equipment; 7) food contact certified equipment and utensils, like the bins that the dough is mixed in; 8) a three compartment sink; 9) all products must be stored 6 inches off of the ground or in plastic or steel containers; and, 10) screen doors. And, he and his colleagues are excited about our oven. They've never inspected anything like it before. Is that a good or a bad thing?   At 1:30 PM we headed over to the bakery--still not quite ours yet while the owners draft the lease--to meet up with our friend Jim Walfish, engineer extraordinaire, in order to go over the structure and get a quick opinion on whether or not we could do the renovations even with our very small budget. I think about the space so much that it was strange to actually be standing inside of it this afternoon. It is small, cinder block, painted white, and very dirty. The windows and glass door onto the street face a small temple and a medical center. Cars zip passed, and the street in front is littered with candy wrappers. But the ceilings still go straight up, and I cannot wait to stand outside on the street and see the facade of our oven peeking through the back wall.   This evening, Chris,  urlLink Ben , the other Emily, and I headed to the  urlLink Aveda  in Ala Moana to check out their "Get in Bed with Aveda" anniversary party. We wandered around the spa, drank pink, green and dirty drinks, sampled puffy pupus and strawberries dipped in chocolate. We had hand massages, and drooled over the massage tables, and went home with custom blended shampoo and coupons for a free hydrotherapy (read: really, really big tub with jets and bubbles) session.   Emily dropped us off back at the house, and Ben stayed for a while before heading home. Chris is falling asleep and I am sitting around, listen to  urlLink music  and looking over the oven plans and thinking about getting ready for bed. It has been like everyday with its tiny steps forward--no lease yet, but we have an appointment with our contractor for February 19th at the bakery to go over everything and set up a timeframe.   It is time for bed. The alarm is set for 8 am, and I expect that we will be up then. Go ahead, call us then. I dare you. We'll be up. Really.

      I know that I am in trouble when it is 2:18 am and I have reached chapter 16 in  urlLink Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government , and I am still excited about it and not at all sleepy.  Why didn't I suffer this sort of insomnia in  urlLink school ?

      We were both expecting a tube, but the plans for the oven arrived this afternoon in an innocuous priority delivery envelope.  We were surprised that they were not blueprints or, for that matter, particularly technical.  It is one more step that has been accomplished, one more thing that had to be lined up before the beginning even got under way.  Now it is time for the meeting with the contractor, to get the estimate for the construction, the timetable, everything.  But in the intervening time, the days go on just as they have been.  Chris got out of bed last night at around 11 PM to bake the bread, and I crawled into bed not much later.  I set the alarm for 8:30 am and stumbled out of the bedroom at around 10 am to the smells of fresh baking bread.  While I sat on the couch waking up from an hour and half of ten minute action dreams full of horse drawn carriages, old friends and strange phone conversations between snoozes, Chris made coffee and brought over a plate with fresh buttered bread and salami.  I started my day off with  urlLink some music  before working on crafting a narrative for the business plan, making a health department phone call, and heading out with Chris to deliver the 22 loaves of bread.  We spent the afternoon hanging out with our friend Sarah, watching some television, talking about our upcoming Oscar Party, and watching Chris slowly fall asleep sprawled out across the love seat, his eyelids dipping lower and lower for longer and longer moments.     We are planning a walk through of the bakery space with an engineer and a health inspector this week to make sure that everything is in order before we sign the lease.  So forward it is, apparently.  Always forward--after some sleep, of course.

      We woke up this morning at around 8:30, when our real estate agent called to talk about the contract for the space for the bakery.  It was not the best way to start the day.  And honestly, I am getting cold feet about it.  Everything about the space is turning into a hassle.  They turned down our first offer without even looking at it, they are refusing to do any work on the building--this includes refusing to open a side door that has been strangely plastered over and even refusing to touch up the floor or the paint.  By the time they started responding to our offers, they decided to up the annual increase from 3% to 5%.   They originally wanted a 3 year lease and we originally wanted a 5 year lease with an option to renew.  Since we are planning some hefty renovations, for which we are getting pretty much nothing in return, we wanted to lock in the space.  They said okay to the 5 years, but no to the option to renew.  After doing some more calculating, we proposed 3 years with an option to renew for 2 more.  And now, here's the kicker: They said no.  I am not sure that I want to stake our bakery on this landlord--and it is giving me little quibbly feelings in my stomach.  I want the bakery, I want to open it now, and everyday passes with a new landlord related hassle.  But it is a nice space, decently located, right size, with windows and tall ceilings.  I feel like the landlord is trying to show us that he has all of the power and that we are helpless little things, tittering around and waiting for him to exercise his will.   After the phone call, we hung out around the house for a little while, and Chris watched two old episodes of  urlLink The West Wing  on  urlLink Bravo  before we headed out to an early lunch.  In the car, on the way back from lunch, we talked about what the schedule will be like at the bakery.  What the space will be like when we are up and running.  What our  lives will be like--how funny it will be to see me wheelbarrowing the wood in from the shed to build the fire every afternoon.

      Last night, Chris set the alarm for 4:40 am.  And then to my surprise, he got up.  We took the weekend slow, and mostly, we took the weekend off.  On Saturday afternoon we went to the Punahou Carnival with Chris's two and half year old nephew and had a pretty good time eating hamburgers and pizza, playing games, and going on rides.  Saturday night, we rented some movies and hung out around the house until we went to  urlLink Sansei  at midnight for a very late dinner.  When we got the bill we realized that everything is 50% off on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights from 10 PM to 1 AM.  We would have ordered more had we known, but it was a nice reward for straying a bit outside of our normal haunts.  (As a note, according to our very nice waitress, they are also 50% off from 5-5:30 PM on Sunday and Monday evenings.)  With Chris's parents out of town, we enjoyed a lovely little sleep-in on Sunday morning.  When Ben stopped by on his way to the baseball game, we were just getting up. He, of course, made fun of us. In the end, Chris and I spent Sunday afternoon on a rather fruitless trip to  urlLink Molly's Smoke House , which as it turns out, is closed on Sundays.  It was a bit disappointing--so instead of just coming home in defeat, we stopped by the  urlLink Party City  in Waikele in order to stock up on Sponge Bob Square Pants party hats,  urlLink Snuffleupagus  party favors, and a very tacky birthday tiara for our friend Sarah's birthday party that evening.  Which pretty much brings us up to date.  It is around 8 am in Honolulu.  It is cool this morning--I am actually wearing a sweater.  We are drinking coffee from Sure Shot, listening to  urlLink this morning's opera , and I am getting ready for the day.  There is a list of things almost a mile long that needs to be done if we are going to sign the lease for the bakery this week.  And time is getting shorter...

      When I was little, someone told me to try counting as high as I could in order to fall asleep at night.  And so that night, I tried it.  I ended up staying up all night, reaching higher and higher numbers until dawn.  The truth is, I was so excited by the prospect of counting that high that it was impossible for me to fall alseep.    One of the problems of opening The Little Blue House is that I am very excited, just like that night.  There are so many things to get done so that we we can open, and I want to start right now.  So it is 3:15 am and I cannot sleep.    I wrote before that I hate waiting.  And now every night is all about waiting until I can make phone calls, and every day is about waiting for something to get done so that we are on track.  It is as though every night is like the night before a huge event and I run through unending lists of things to do in my head.  And I want to get them all done.  Right now.  At 3:21 am.  Anyone know a Honolulu lawyer who doesn't charge extra for strange hour phone calls?

      Driving home from Kat's Sushi, Chris and I ended up next to the Spam-Mobile, a huge blue Spam Box on wheels, with the license plate SPAM4U registered in Minnesota.  They must have shipped it here--and I can only begin to imagine how much fun it would have been to be working on that boat.

      Last night, Chris set the alarm for 4 o'clock in the morning.  He is taking notes on the performance of the HFM flour he picked up last week.  And, he is practicing mixing larger batches of dough by hand--even though our oven cannot begin to handle the output.  He is forced to throw the leftovers away in doubled garbage bags, and we seriously hope that the dough does not continue to grow and take over our garbage cans.  When he was done, he set the coffee pot for 8:30 in the morning and crawled back into bed, where we both slept through the smell of freshly brewing coffee.  When I finally got out of bed, I warmed up some milk, added the  urlLink coffee  and three teaspoons of sugar.  I turned on  urlLink this morning's opera selection , and shut the door to the bedroom so that Chris can sleep a bit more.  In  urlLink The Physiology of Taste , Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin wrote that sugar, when mixed with coffee and milk "makes a light, agreeable and easily procurable form of nourishment, most suitable for those persons who have to begin work immediately after breakfast."  I am not sure how cafe au lait became my morning drink of choice, though usually having to begin work immediately after breakfast may have done a bit to reinforce the leaning.  Much like today.  Work starts right after breakfast.  In our meeting with the potential investor, and during some email exchanges, he had expressed concern that our business insurance could be very expensive--and that he was a bit worried on our behalf.  Yesterday morning I spoke with an insurance guy the potential investor had recommended.  He seems very nice, and even reassured me a bit by giving us an unofficial window for the price of the insurance.  This morning, right after breakfast, I tried to return his assistant's call from yesterday in order to have a more firm number to work into our projections for start up cost and running the business.  No one was there, so I tried the lawyer again.  No answer.  I think that these sorts of things are going to be our major problems.  Sometimes it is hard to remember that this project, which is so important to me, is not as important to other people.  It is hard to remember that they have other things to do, and that they are not just sitting by the phone and waiting for  urlLink The Little Blue House  to call.  I need the numbers in order to re-crunch our projections, and I just have to wait.  I hate waiting.  Tonight we are having dinner at  urlLink Kat's Sushi  for Lance's birthday.  It is all you can eat, so we might end up skipping lunch in preparation, so I am looking forward to dinner and then tomorrow's cafe au lait.

      This morning I woke up to the commotion of Chris bounding into the bedroom--FedEx Package in hand.  Chris has always wanted to receive and sign for a FedEx package, and in his hands, he held his very first.  He kind of thrust it at me with a sort half-grin and half-smirk that I immediately understood when I saw the return address.   The Shipping Department, Charlie Trotters, 816 W. Armitage Ave .  When Chris and I lived in Chicago,  urlLink we had a couple of run-ins  with  urlLink Charlie Trotter .  The end result is that I send him a card every year around the holidays.  And it goes unnoticed.  At least, it usually goes unnoticed.  Inside the box was a signed copy of Chef Trotter's newer book,  urlLink Raw , co-authored with  urlLink Roxanne Klein  and a typed letter.  It read:  "Dear Emily & Christopher, Thank you for the holiday card.  I am enclosing a copy of my new book, RAW, co-authored with my colleague Roxanne Klein of  Roxanne's  in Larkspur California.  I thought you might enjoy this sensual and intriguing approach to cuisine.  I look forward to visiting you soon in Honolulu but until then, I wish you my very best.  With high regards, Charlie"  And right when I've run out of thank you cards.  Can you believe that I have to go back to the card store?

      Oh my goodness gracious, the management company has accepted our offer on the space and now we are moving forward at breakneck speeds.  They want to start the lease on February 15th--how in the world are we going to have the money together by then?

      We did not set the alarm clock last night.  But this morning, I sprang out of bed at 8:55 am when Ben's cell phone rang in the living room.  Ben--in case you are reading this--your cell phone is in our living room, apparently.  It is on the seafoam and white tile coffee table in front of the 1960's blue seashell print couch.  But I was up, and after chosing  urlLink this morning's opera selection  on the iPod, I sat on the couch  urlLink reading the paper  and waking up slowly.  Just as I was about ready  urlLink to make coffee  and pester Chris into getting out of bed, my friend Aaron sent me a text message announcing both his brand new job and his brand new niece.  I called him back and we chatted, until he pointed out that he should get back to his family as they were still in the hospital.  His niece had actually  just  been born about an hour earlier.  Cell phones are crazy things.  So later this afternoon, I am going to have to go buy happy-new-baby card for his brother and a happy-new-job card for him.  And I really enjoyed talking with Aaron because I was able to sort of catch him up on the bakery stuff.    We are, thus far, keeping the accountant with whom we met on Wednesday, regardless of his lecturing tone.  He seems like a good guy, so tomorrow we we will call one of the lawyers he recommended and set up a meeting.    Everything seemed to go well the potential investors we met with on Saturday afternoon.  They were pretty young and really quite cool, and we got a kick out of hanging out with them--even aside from their possible interest in helping us get started.  They seem to want to do this for all of the right reasons, and even more importantly, we all seem to agree that  urlLink The Little Blue House  is about quality artisanal bread.  They like the idea that we are building an oven with a capacity of 450 loaves even though we only plan on getting up to 240 loaves a day.  It leaves room for growth if Honolulu bread eaters really seem to need more than 240 loaves a day.  We had a lovely time, and now Chris and I are much more comfortable with their interest--provided that they still have interest, of course.  This whole thing is scary.  I know that I've written that here before.  But we here we are, young enough that our accountant treats us like junior high school students doing a project on how to start a company, and we have lined up about half of our start-up money.  And now, these strangers are talking about giving us close to the other half.  I am so excited that I cannot fall asleep at night, and when I do fall asleep, I have vivid dreams about tidalwaves, Chris's brother  urlLink Mike  yelling at me, and my friend John Perkin's family walking through my Aunt Casey's vacation house in Bar Harbor, Maine.  Of John and other greeting cards needs, after playing phone tag for about a month, I finally got in touch with him yesterday.  Over the last month, I had received his phone messages while I was everywhere from London to Honolulu, and it turns out that he had been trying to get a hold of me to announce his engagement!  So now I need a happy-engagement card too.    And if the card store has a happy-imminent-pop-stardom-card, I might send one to  urlLink Ben Jelen , a friend of mine from high school with whom I have completely lost touch--and whose pre-released single on iTunes sent me back to my old yearbooks to compare pictures just to make sure that it was actually the same guy who sat in front of me and Ali Tracey in Doug Snyder's AP US History Class so long ago.  Of course, I still wasn't entirely sure until after getting confirmation from  urlLink Ned Norland, the music expert .   But really, so many greeting card needs, so little time.

      So, our real estate agent called us this morning to tell us that the landlord set a sign by time of 4 PM today. After a couple of lawyer calls, we were informed by the landlord's real estate agent that they were unwilling to negotiate the lease at all.  So, just under 2 weeks from when we were given the lease and our spirits were high, we've turned down the space and have to start over.  We are both very sad.

      This morning, Chris set the alarm for 7:30 am.  When I heard the alarm go off, I stumbled into the bedroom and tried to wake him.    I am sleepless again.  This morning, I was still up from the night before, and have had about two hours of sleep since. So today was a hazy of lawyer phone calls--four different lawyers actually--and attempts to figure out various leases.  Everything is a bit blurred, but Chris made a lovely pity-party dinner with American Kobe, Tuna Belly, fresh wasabi, limes, kale, sparkling white wine and fuji apples for dessert.  I hope that I am so full that I cannot help but sleeping.

      This afternoon Chris told me that he has probably exhausted the internet's resources on masonry ovens, flour, flooring, bakeries, everything.  I had just found  urlLink a great brick oven link , so I sent it on to him even though I expect that he has already seen.

      Last night, Chris set the alarm clock for 7:15 am.  He got up at around 9 and the sounds of the  urlLink West Wing  re-runs on  urlLink Bravo  filtered into the bedroom for two hours.  All the while, he made phone calls and consulted with our architect on one of the latest problems.  I had strange dreams.  From the minute that Willy saw the building last week, he suspected that the attached carport--the soon to be home of the oven--is in fact an illegally built structure and that if we applied to build the oven in it, we would be rejected as the building does not legally exist.  It is made from the wrong material.  It is too close to the property line. And so on.  This is also a problem because the landlord is assessing our share of all of the fees and property taxes on this strange 640 square feet calculation.  And I say strange, because the interior of the building is about 360 square feet.  We, of course, accepted the 640 square feet when we decided to build the oven mostly in the carport, but now it just seems rather bold of the landlord to be making us responsible for a whole lot of illegal square footage.  To settle the matter, Chris headed to the  urlLink Department of Planning and Permitting's  Office of Data Access and Imaging.  He discovered that the building was erected in 1941, and is designated as a warehouse.  We are going to have wait for the rest of file for a while because of its age.  Apparently, it is a paper file.  But, the nice Planning people were able to answer one question.  It turns out that Willy was right.  According to the city, the building is 360 square feet with no external structures.  Is this, perhaps, the reasoning behind some of the language in our lease?  The language that makes us responsible for fees assessed by the City and County of Honolulu, and makes us responsible for making any repairs mandated by the City?    While Chris went out, I stayed in bed for a long time this morning, drinking my  urlLink coffee  while reading and then typing away.  The lawyer I called yesterday about the lease called me back to say that while he would love to read it over, he is out of town until Friday.  Another lawyer, to whom I was referred by a lovely woman named Georgia who seems excited to help move the bakery forward, got back to me by email and referred me to someone else.  And then I made a few phone calls about finding an apartment, and found nothing there either.  It was disheartening.  I love this house, and I hate to leave it, but more than that, I want to not be homeless next month.  I have too many books to cart around.  And Chris has too much flour.  We went to  urlLink a calm and rather late lunch .  We didn't talk about the bakery much. Instead, we flipped through a copy of Food & Wine with  urlLink the Laura Cunningham interview .    Chris liked that they stack things on their coffee table, since it is not something that I am willing to do.  And then we came home, and made more phone calls, and Chris took a nap while I finally finished reading Hughes'  urlLink Goya .  We had leftovers from the Oscar Party for dinner and hung out a bit.    Now he is up, baking bread and playing with a recipe, and I am getting ready for bed.  So perhaps, I will be up before him in the morning.  And at least, I will have some lovely fresh bread to go with my coffee.

      This morning, the phone started ringing and never seemed to stop.  Real estate agent, parents, architect, parents, lawyer, parents... Chris had set the alarm for 8:30 am, but we had both been up to the phone and back to bed before it started beeping.  I was tired, groggy, and a bit raccoon-eyed after wearing mascara and even dressing up in  urlLink an old gold and lace dress of mine  from so long ago... from so long ago that I had a need for a semi-formal dress every once in a while.    We had, what Emily Robinson has taken to calling our "First Annual Oscar Party" last night.  I wore my hair up and rabidly enforced a dress-up dress code.  Chris made fabulous Brazilian foods for fun.  We ate Feijoada and rice with carrots and kale with garlic and chickeny flavors.  Chris complained that pig ears and tails are too expensive to actually buy.  We drank very un-Brazillian Mojitos, and I ended up with my arms, face, chest in lime juice and little bits of limes from muddling the limes, sugar, mint and rum in a morter with a pestle.  We made ballots and voted for our favorites and those that we each thought would win.  I got every single catagory wrong.  And then, Lance, Ben, Chris and I went out to Aaron's atop Ala Moana Hotel to look at Honolulu from above.  We could see a bit of ocean, and Ben pointed out the breakers between the buildings.  And then we came home.  It was lovely to take off high heels and plant my feet flat on the floor, but it was just as lovely take have worn them to feel the change.  And then this morning, the phone started to ring.  The problem is that we received a copy of the lease for the bakery on Saturday.  It was prepared by the landlord's lawyer, and it is scary.  It has us as responsible for everything.  If by no fault of our own the building falls down, not only do we have to keep paying rent for the term of the lease, we have to rebuild so that we can return the building in the state in which we received it.  If there is an EPA or ADA claim for structure or past pollution, we have to pay to fix it or clean it or pay damages, or whatever.  My jaw dropped as I turned pages, and then I covered them with scrawled and angry notes about liability and reciprocity.  And now we are back to scared--because we want the building but we are not willing to take this lease.  And we cannot find a lawyer, and we have to act quickly, and time keeps on going, and the phone continues to ring.  So we went to lunch with Chris's parents, and left the phone where it was, sitting on the edge of the couch that use to be covered in large 1960s blue seashells and tears, though now they are hidden under little pale lime and white stripes.     But Chris's parents were late meeting us, so we sat and stewed for a while, looking at each couple's silhouette behind the dark screen that blocked our view of the door.  We guessed when we thought that it was them.  Much like the Oscars, I was more than occasionally wrong.  When they arrived, we talked about the lease a bit more.  We stewed a bit more.  We ate  urlLink a lovely lunch .  I am hoping that if I keep my fingers crossed that the landlord will relent and we will have this little building for our bakery.  But I am losing hope.  After lunch we drove around a bit and looked for "For Rent" signs in stores and houses in Kaimuki.  I called a real estate agent after peering in the windows of a space that Chris says use to be a Pizza Hut--we could see the old oven through the window--but it is too big and too much per square foot.  But this evening, Chris, Ben and I watched  urlLink L'Auberge Espagnole .  I sat facing the television, watching the movie for a second time, and thought about the adventure that is in front of us.  Chris and I are 25 and 24, and we are about to start this amazing new thing--this thing that is separate from us, but is going to be a huge part of our lives.  With a 5 year lease, it is going to define us until we are 30.  This is our adventure, and it is hard to remember that sometimes.  It is scary, and hard, and heartbreaking, but we are creating this thing, this space, this life.  And it has been starting, and keeps on starting, every day.

      We had a great meeting this morning, and our contractor and landlord really seemed to get along. They were on the same page by the last handshakes.  That's right, the Little Blue House Bakery is going forward.  Construction will probably begin in late June or July and take about a month.  Here we go...

      When we pushed open the bedroom windows this afternoon, Chris sat on the bed to start the very last chapter in the  urlLink John Adams book  he has been reading for almost three years.  He said that it felt like sleeping outside to have the breeze rush in while he sat on the bed, leaning against the pillows and the wall.  Pretty quickly, he fell asleep for an unplanned afternoon nap.  I left him there for a couple of hours--after all, I was the one who made him get up early this morning.  I woke up at around 5:30 am, and sort of refused to believe that I was awake until around 6.  I got up, I  urlLink read the paper  for a while, and flipped through a  urlLink cookbook  or  urlLink two , and ended up blindly surfing the internet for a while.  Good for me, because I stumbled on the scheduling for tonight's showing of  urlLink American Masters: Alice Waters .  Chris, however, did not appreciate it when I went bounding back into the bedroom at 6:47 am to tell him the good news.  Surprisingly enough, though, when I finally got him out of bed a bit more than hour later to go to the  urlLink Farmer's Market , he still remembered.  We ended up not buying anything, but we sat in the shade on a blanket and drank our coffee.  It was very nice.  But I can understand his nap.

      According to  urlLink Alberto , today is  urlLink UNESCO's World Book Day .  Apparently, April 23rd is a big birth and death day for famous writers.   In 1616,  urlLink Cervantes ,  urlLink Shakespeare  and  urlLink Inca Garcilaso de la Vega  all died on April 23rd. Other authors who were born or died on this day?  urlLink Maurice Druon ,  urlLink Vladimir Nabokov ,  urlLink Josep Pla  and  urlLink Manuel Mejía Vallejo .  It was interesting enough to amuse me in between juggling phone calls, I suppose.    The alarm was set for 8:30 am, and I sat bolt upright at about 8:28 am.  I don't know what woke me up, but there I was.  Awake before the alarm.  I sat in bed for those last two minutes, and around when  urlLink the alarm went off , the phone started to ring.  It is unusual for Chris's mom to call at 8:30 in the morning.  It is not all that unusual for his dad to call, or his aunt, or even for his friend Lee to call then.  My little sister Maggie has even called at 6 am.  But not Chris's mom.  This should have set off bells, but it didn't.  Chris's mom scratched the side of her car against a post in a parking lot.  This is a big deal because the car is pretty nice, and Chris's dad is a little overprotective of it.  So Chris's mom was calling us on the sly, trying to get the skinny on fixing a car before Chris's dad could find out.  Luckily, we are those crazy people who actually have a great mechanic.  (If you live in Honolulu, and need a mechanic, email us and I'll give you his number.  He's that good.)  Anyway, I called up Mechanic William and he gave the name of a guy who can fix it.  I don't know anyone else who is that hyper at 8:30 in the morning--I expect that he was actually bouncing off of the walls in the garage.  So now, before I head to my wonderful  urlLink eGullet lunch  at  urlLink El Charro , Chris and I have to sneak the car to get fixed.  It should be an interesting day.  Did I actually use "get the skinny" and "on the sly" in one sentence?  Oh goodness gracious.

      On April 28th, at 8:30 am, Chris and I will meet with our contractor, our architect, our structural engineer and the landlord.  We will make sure that everyone is one the same page, that what we are planning can be done for a reasonable amount of money in a reasonable amount of time, and then we will sign the lease.  The alarm was set this morning for 9 am, but I woke up with a start at 8:49 am and lept out of bed.  I phoned the contractor and left yet another message, and this time I was sort of mean of mean about it.  When I called the other day, I had been very specific about our landlord's requirement to meet and talk with contractor before we get to sign the lease.  In no uncertain terms, I explained the timetable and so on.  I thought that maybe the contractor had dismissed us as flakes after the Liliha space fell through, and I wanted to make sure that he knew that we really aren't.  And then no one called me back.  Hence this morning, when I very politely asked them to call me back  whether or not they wanted the job .  Chris answered the phone a few hours later, and our contractor's assistant begged our forgiveness, took all the blame, and set the meeting.  So voila.  We have a plan, sort of.  We celebrated with the  urlLink coffee  I made this morning and the extra baguette Chris made to go with dinner last night.  He sliced it down the middle, smeared sweet butter all over both sides and topped it with thick slices of  urlLink Bellwether Farms'  Carmody, a hand made Jersey cow milk cheese from Petaluma, California.  I guess that this means that I no longer need to keep reading  urlLink The Iliad  in an effort to discover enough military strategy to find the contractor and drag his armour in the dirt--even though this is what a very wise person told me to do.  I guess I'll keep reading just in case we get into trouble with our flour suppliers later on...

       urlLink Temecula Sweet.   Satsuma x Ponkan, first fruited in C.T. Lin's Montana greenhouse in 1981. Large, round or necked; rind thick and bumpy; flesh relatively dry but very sweet, similar to Ponkan; seeds few; late season.  Proprietary variety, a big hit at Asian and speciality markets in Orange and Los Angeles counties.  Now all I need to do is find this C.T. Lin and have all of my Temecula questions answered.

      I woke up this morning slowly.  Knowing that there was no  urlLink coffee  left, I idled in bed listening to  urlLink music  and watching old sheer white curtains billow in the breeze the way I have always imagined them billowing when my mother first hung them more than 20 years ago in Athens.  These curtains were made for a breeze like this, and all of those years that they hung in our apartment in New York--where I remember them from--seem like a waste.  These are tropical curtains.  The gecko look about right when the occasional one ducks under the folds.  This is how I think in the morning, I guess, putting back together memories of wind from when my family lived in Greece and I was too young to remember anything.  We got up and I  urlLink read  while Chris fed the starter.  He is planning to bake bread on Thursday and Friday to get the feel of the oven here--though he is itching to start baking in an oven that has been heated by a woodfire, this one will have to do for the moment.  We went for coffee, and most importantly to buy coffee for the next week or so, and then spent the afternoon running errands.  While I silently planned my perfect grilled cheese sandwich for dinner, I also made a couple of bakery phone calls and left pleading messages for people to call me back.  As Chris often points out, I hate waiting.  And all of this waiting is driving me crazy.  The amazingly bright spot was the fabulous belated birthday gift that Chris received from his brother and sister: four pinot noir glass from  urlLink Riedel's new O collection . (thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I wasn't even the birthday boy.)  They are very cool.  His sister gave them to him in a bag, each set of two wrapped in a different box.  You know he didn't see the gift coming because he greedily reached into the bag, took out a box, lifted it his ear,  and started to shake it .  Half a shake was all it took for him to hear the rattle, and suddenly his face shifted from curiosity to horror.  He was convinced that he had broken them.  After a frantic, yet careful unwrapping, we discovered that all of the glasses were fine... And I was thankful for the fact that he can recognize the sound of Riedel!  He is feeding the starter again, as everyday goes.  And tonight we will set the alarm for a little bit earlier because a friend has come into two fresh Snappers and Chris is excited to figure out what to do with them for dinner.

      The alarm was set this morning for 8 am.  I am not sure when we turned it off, but we did.  We did not get up for a while longer, and the grey skies above our little house made it seem like early morning for a long time after it no longer was.  A bit for 8 am, a bit before the alarm turned on and we turned it off, there was a sound like a garbage truck backing up our neighbor's driveway.  Chris made a mad dash for the door to put the can out, but instead of a garbage truck it was a truck full of construction guys and equipment.  They've been working on the roof of the house next door ever since.  They have these nail guns and huge staplers for attaching the shingles.  When I hear them from the bedroom--a room and a few doors away from the living room picture window view of all of the action--it seems to me like someone is going crazy on a typewriter.  It is sort of a cool image.  We are still trying to arrange our meeting with the landlord, our structural engineer, our contractor, and our architect to view the bakery space before we can sign the lease.  The meeting may happen tomorrow, but no one seems to be getting back to us as quickly as we would like.  It is driving me crazy that these things take so long, but at least we've had some time to move in to the new house, settle in, and admire the huge pile of things in the living room that have not yet been put away because we haven't quite figured out where to put them.  Chris seems to have finally gotten over a bit of the shock of the move, though he is still saying angry things about the number of books that move around with me.  I suddenly can no longer remember all of the reasons for signing a six month lease for the house--something about finding a place we plan on settling into for a while, and moving that one last time for a long time.  We've become those people who, while driving down the street, point out every "House For Sale" sign we can see.  It is very strange.  This weekend, Chris cooked dinner for our friends Emily and Scott, as well as for the ever present friend Ben, to thank them for helping us with the move.  We went to  urlLink Marukai  to abuse their sale on prime beef and discovered temecula oranges.  They are wrinkly and sort of deformed, but when you pick one up it feels light and hollow, like the skin was about to fall off and it sort of had nothing to do with the orange.  The fruit inside seemed to jiggle. We purchased two, just to try.  While Chris was playing with the steaks over the fire, I peeled into one of the oranges.   The flesh was really intense, Chris called it super concentrated orange flavor, a really pure expression of what you'd imagine the perfect orange to taste like.  I spent part of yesterday afternoon googling temecula oranges and didn't come up with much.  Temecula is just a town in Orange County where a large portion of the oranges in California are grown.  Neither Chris nor I were able to find any positive references to shrivled fruit.  So now we just have a mystery, and the bag of temecula oranges we went back to buy yesterday.   (Why do I feel like the title to this entry should occur at some point in  urlLink Little Miss Strange ?)

      It is 5:53 am on Tuesday morning, and the alarm is set for 8 am.  Chris is snoring away, the birds are chirping, and I am pretty sure that there is some more light outside the windows now than there was 20 minutes ago.  Or, I guess 7-11 may have just turned up their parking lot lights.  We are in the midst of moving.  The books have all been moved, and most of them have been put onto the shelves.  Chris and Ben were able to get the dresser into Ben's car and then struggled up the little path with it.  They were both red and sweaty by the time they got it up the stairs to the porch.  Table, chairs, couches, television, all of these things are starting to fill the new house.  We are still sleeping at the old house though.  We are not quite ready to give it up.  Two nights ago, we moved the bed out from the bedroom to the middle of the living room.  So now, I am sitting on the edge of the bed in the rising light, listening to still hard mangos fall from the tree and hit the front walk with solid sounding booms.  At 6 am,  urlLink Jamba Juice  will start giving away free smoothies.  I tried to convice Chris that it was for his birthday, but really, it is a fundraising even for Juvenile Diabetes research.  I might go get one before it is entirely light out and I can no longer tell myself that it is too early to get back to packing.  Yesterday afternoon, I spoke with the landlord about the Chinatown space for the bakery.  I told him that we want to sign the lease.  So we will make an appointment to tour it with our contractor, engineer, and architect and then we will sign it.  And The Little Blue House will be on its way.  On an important note: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CHRISTOPHER HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.... and many more.  Love, Em

      Fabulous Princetonian  urlLink Jannon Stein  has seen fit to donate to The Little Blue House Oven Fund.  You too can can be an Honororary Baker for the Day by hitting the "Make a Donation" button on the right.  Jannon has always been a hip, trend-setting, kind of girl, so maybe we are seeing the beginning of a trend.    Maybe you will follow Jannon and hit that button to help us build the oven.  You know you want to!  She made leather jackets cool again, she made Modest Mouse not so modest, she had a semi-formal birthday party at a mini-golf course!  Strive to be like Jannon: give us money.  Or, keeping in mind that tomorrow is  urlLink Chris's birthday , just help us out a bit because we have a dream and plan and we can get there with a little bit of help. Your help.  Geez, now I feel like  urlLink Ira Glass  in all of those NPR beg-a-thons, except for the glaring fact that I am just not funny.  Please put me out of my misery!

      For Our Local Readers and Friends: Chris was playing with recipes last night, and ended up making nine extra loaves of bread.  They will be available on a first-come-first-serve sort of basis this afternoon, so follow  urlLink The Little Blue House link  for more information on our bread or  urlLink email us  to make an order.  For Everyone Else: I did a quick read through of the lease and will take a more thorough look later this afternoon.  It actually looks good.  Keep your fingers and toes crossed!  We may have an opening date to post here soon.

      We should have some good news soon regarding the bakery.    Here's the thing: we are picking up a lease tomorrow to review it before signing.  It is for a beautiful little space in a brick building in Chinatown. We would have about 340 square feet, and a pretty view of the interior courtyard and a chance to expand in a year or 18 months.  About a week after the Liliha lease fell through, we went on a Saturday morning walk in Chinatown with Chris's aunt.  We wandered into the courtyard of this particular building, and looked around to see if there were any "for lease" signs.  There weren't.  And then, Chris's aunt made me ask a guy sitting in one of the stores about the landlord.  Shy as I am, I was enamored with the building and the courtyard and the brick, and I asked.  And that is how we found this space.  There is bad news, however.  The space is currently occupied on a month-to-month basis with a clause guaranteeing three months notice before eviction.  So, we will sign the lease this week but not be able to get started on building the oven until three months later.    Having just watch Pollyanna on the Hallmark channel yesterday--Chris still has never seen it and he fled as soon as I turned it on--now seems like the right time to play the "glad game". Because, though we are tired of waiting and getting nervous as the date for regular income gets further and further away, I am glad that this delay will give us time to secure building permits, materials, and contractor schedules far in advance.  Hopefully, this will help keep down the costs.  See, there is something to be glad about.  Really.  There is.  However, perhaps this is the time that I should again plug our HONORARY BAKER FOR THE DAY program.    Anyone who clicks on the little "Make A Donation" button to the right-hand side of the screen and makes a "donation" of $75 or more and wants to be named, will be listed on this site as an "Honorary Baker for the Day."  And just to be clear, by donation we mean that you give us money for nothing, no service, no product, no stock, no equity, nothing except the warm and happy feeling you will have when you help us on our way to the oven.

      This morning my friend Heather Mohn, from a time long, long ago  urlLink on a mountain far, far away , sent me a cookie recipe without warning and without a note.  I cannot resist titles of recipes that start with "Grandma", so I will leave it here for you to ponder.  Grandma Siegried's Molasses Cookies   1 cup gran. sugar 3/4 cup Crisco (no Oil) 1 large egg 1/4 cup baking molasses 2 tsp. baking soda 1 tsp. ground ginger 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/2 tsp. salt 2 cups sifted flour   Cream Crisco and sugar until fluffy, add molasses and egg.  Beat well.  Sift remaining ingredients together.  Add to creamed mixture, mix well.  Refrigerate overnight.  Roll into balls or thin strips.  Roll in granulated sugar.  Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  Leave on pan a few minutes as they break easily.

      Chris took the "What Villan Am I?" Test, and is it turns out...       Chris took the most accurate villain personality test   created by:   urlLink The Arch Villainess Gracie      It works, of course, as Captain Hook was a bit of a chef. Let's see if I can remember this correctly, something about cooking a cake quite large and filling each layer in between with a layer cooked with poison until it turns a tempting green.... I feel a tango coming on.

      We now have an official construction start date of July 1st.  Lots of things have to be done before that, mostly involving building permits and tacking down exact numbers for estimates.  We still need to hammer out some legal stuff with investors in order to do this the way we want to it, but we really do appear to be on our way... Yet again!  At the latest, hopefully, with fingers crossed and aimed at our contractor, doors will open softly around September 1st.

      I received a Recipe Exchange email from  urlLink an old friend  a few days ago--and while I don't usually pass on chain mail, I loved the idea of this one so much that I did.  I finally got one back this afternoon:  Anne King's Banana Cookies 3/4 cups butter, softened 2/3 cups sugar 1 egg 1 1/4 cups flour 1/8 tsp salt 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1 1/2 cups rolled oats 1 cup mashed banana (approximately 2 bananas) 1 cup chocolate chips or dried fruit (raisins, dried cranberries, dried cherries) 1/2 cup chopped nuts  1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2.  Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. 3.  In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, and cinnamon. 4.  Beat flour mixture into butter/sugar mixture. 5.  Mix in oats, banana, chocolate chips or dried fruit, and nuts. 6.  Drop by teaspoons (forming into somewhat smooth balls, then flattening slightly) unto greased cookie sheet.  7.  Bake for 12 to 14 minutes.

      So, yes, emails have started to come in, egullet posts are starting to wonder, etc, so I suppose that it is time to let the reading public know what is going on...  We have decided to put off the bakery for a while--as an in a year or two.  There are lots of reasons, of course.  Some have to do with questions about the space, about the funding, about the oven, about the future, and then in the middle of all of the questions, I rather surprisingly was admitted into a one year master's program at NYU.    We are still excited about bread, we are still excited about unleashing Chris's talent on Honolulu, but we are going to take a year or two on the mainland to come up with an even better way of doing it.  The opportunities in New York are amazing, and we are going to take full advantage of them and bring back everything we learn.  And now the question is, do you guys want me to keep posting here?  Do you mind watching a much more drawn out process?  Or would you prefer if I close up the blog until we are back on Oahu?  PS: Chris is still in Honolulu, stuck with packing up the house.  So cut him a break if you run in to him.  I am already in New York--I've already found us a tiny little apartment that makes the Little Blue House look like a mansion.  It's a pretty neat area, and being the crazy bread folks we are, I have to tell you that I am pretty excited about being right up the street from the  urlLink Sullivan Street Bakery , for those times when Chris is too busy working for someone else to keep the bread baking at the current rate.
