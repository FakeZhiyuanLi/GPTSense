      Maneka gandhi believes that she knows it all; I ask you people does she really ? I think otherwise, here is how and why ??  you know old habbits die hard, and so the habit of being in lime light, but the problem with dear Ms.Gandhi was that she was hardly getting anything to just reannounce to the world that she is still there. We all know that GOD is so kind, so HE wasnt able to see our Ms.Gandhi in pain of not being in public light, so the GOD made our very own pro - poor and socialist Sri Lalloo Prasad yadav a medium to provide Ms. Gandhi with her desireOur Lalloo Jee famously announced just within the minutes of sworning in as the Railway Minister, that now onwards - if you travel by rail then be ready to have the VIDESHI COLAS in our very own DESHI KULHADS(clay pots).He reasoned that it will not only be enviornment friendly but also will be employment and trade generating for the poors.  But his Hard luck ! Maneka Gandhi,( the know it all of Eco System, the Environment sc. and what not ?), just got the time she was looking for months now;Once she famously wrote in a National weekly - that Indians digesion system can not digest milk, so taking milk as nutrition is of no use, now she writes that these Kulhads are not going to help the environment(again in a National weekly).The reasons which she had provided there reflects that she knows all those sciences and others hardly have any knowledge.  She says there that Kulhads can not be destroyed, is hard to dump ?(so I ask that if the clay pots are hard to degrade, then what about the plastic cups ?).We never knew, we have hardly seen any Kulhads, and have hardly used it.She says that it will make those working in the plastics industry unemployed, Dear Ms. Gandhi dont you know that these plastic kind of industry are just concentrated in few places, taking a very less population in its fold, but if the Kulhad industry will start - it will support the wide population and the much needy one.Second thing that the plastics industry employes lesser manpower because of its automation, where the kulhad industry is less automated and more physical labour involving, so creating better employment opportunity.And just by stop of the use of plastics in Railways is not going to ruin this industry, because it has so deep penetration in the daily use that it will continue as a growing industry, offcourse there will be a decrease in volumes but hardly the unemployment scenario it will bring which Maneka has projected.  So Madam ! at least see the poor Lalloo jee, he had hardly done anything productive (except having so many offsprings) to be remembered as a good reformer leader; here he does something really good, but because Ms. Gandhi needed something as platform to renounce her presence, so she choose this one, why madam why ?At least think about the poor Lalloo jee if not about the poor labour getting his job back of making kulhads, and even you can not consider that then at least consider that trying to announce that I AM JACK OF ALL TRADES also brings the suffixed line --- BUT YOU ARE MASTER OF NONE.

        Expectation is the major cause of frustration, isn't it ? So, whatever we get, we wish to get more, but have we ever thought these :-
