      The Importance of Clarity  For a worship leader to be the most effective, he or she needs to be very clear on who the audience is, and what the context of the worship is.  Ask youself...  1. Am I leading worship at an event for believers, seekers, or both? 2. What is the age group? (for stylistic purposes) 3. Who (if at all) is speaking, and what are they trying to accomplish?

      There are certain criteria that a song has to make before I will use it in worship services at my church.  When I hear or look at a new song, I ask the following nine questions: 	1. Is this song biblically true? 	2. Do the lyrics make sense? 	3. After hearing the song only once, do I know what the song is about? 	4. Are there several spots in the song where it can be repeated? 	5. Can the average attender at NBC sing this song? 	6. Is this song a fresh expression of worship? 	7. Can this song be done in a small group setting? 	8. Is this song easy to learn? 	9. Will a visitor to our church be able to understand what this song it about?  If I can answer “yes” to all nine of these questions, then I consider it for introduction in our worship services.  If I can’t answer “yes” to all them, then I consider the song for special music at a later date.  If I can’t see us doing the song as a special music one day, then I put the song away all together.   	One of the most important things to remember about worship music is that each song has to hit a very wide target of age, gender, doctrine, and genre.  There are a lot of worship songs that I don’t particularly like, but I do them because they meet all nine of my criteria, and because they both connect and minister to people in my audience.  We serve in a Church full of all kinds of people from all walks of life, and it is vital that we worship with music that is accessible to them.  	Two other things that I highly value in worship music are participation and simplicity.  If there is a song that I do that congregation tends to not join in with, unless it is fairly new, I pull that song from our list.  There are some songs where part of the song is meant for presentation and the rest is meant for participation, and that is fine with me.  (For instance, a solo on a verse and everyone singing the chorus). Simplicity is VITAL in worship music.  When I write worship songs, I purposefully keep it simple (think "Be My Strength") because the Church needs songs that everyone can sing and just about anyone can play.  This is why I usually write in the keys of D, E, or G.  When you learn guitar or piano, these keys are what you learn first, and that's what I mean by saying that just about anyone can play them.  Simplicity allows the heart to focus on God through the song.  While pieces such as Handel's "Messiah" are incredible works of worship, the average church could never do it.  Simplicity is key.

      The Purpose of Lament  Here's a great question that was asked in a message given by Wade Hodges from Sterling Drive Church in Bellingham.  He asked "why don't we use the emotion of lament in worship services?"  This is a GREAT question. I don't want to be Sam-centered, but as a songwriter, I want to look at one my songs, and show you why I wrote it the way I did, and why I didn't write my full thoughts into the song. Bear with me for a moment, I promise I'm going somewhere with this...   Be My Strength is the name of the song. Here are the simple lyrics.   Be my strength, when I'm lonely and afraid  Be my strength, guide my life within Your way   You alone are my joy, You alone are my peace  You alone are my God, be my strength   Be my strength, keep my mind on things above  Be my strength, I cannot breathe without Your love   (repeat the "You alone" part).   I wrote this songs sitting on the stage at Sterling Drive Church in Bellingham in the middle of a hard season in life. I wanted to express my heart's feeling that I was out of strength and that I had felt that God was holding out on me. I couldn't feel His presence, and I couldn't find the intimacy that I had once experienced on a regular basis.   The original version of the song had two lines before the chorus (the "You alone" part) that said...   I long for You to be near  I wish that I could truly feel that...  You alone are my joy  You alone are my peace  You alone are my God  Be my strength   I took the two lines out before the chorus because several people who were critiquing the song for me told me that it felt like this song was not a song of hope, but a song of sadness. They said that this wasn't a song for corporate use because churches need songs that acknowledge God's constant presence in our lives. I took the advice of this Christian publishing company (who will remain nameless, and with whom I have taken back copyright title from) and I took out those lines. I regret having done it almost every time I sing it or hear it performed.   Why aren't we more honest with ourselves? Don't we all go through dry spells in our faith? Haven't we all had experiences that parallel the writings of the psalmist crying out in anguish to God?   I wonder if we are presenting God, or if we are presenting out ideal view of God.    If you look at pop culture, you'll see a zillion different songs of lament.  Bands like Radiohead, Nirvana, 311, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and even Creed have songs full of angst and sorrow, and we buy they're records by the armful.  Could it be that our nation needs a church that can teach them how to approach God with their sorrow?  On his website (www.wadehodges.com), Wade said this...  "I think there may be a credibility issue at stake here. If our witness to the world doesn't include appropriate forms of lament, then we may be judged by some--those who are in the pit--as being out of touch with reality. If we are looking for ways to be a counter-cultural influence in the world, this is a golden opportunity. We can do a service for the world by showing those who are suffering how to articulate their pain to the One who can do something about it, and hopefully win them to Christ, (who remember, cried out "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?") in the process."  I couldn't agree more.  For those of you are worship leaders, especially if you are a songwriter, I want to know what you think about this.  Sam Middlebrook sam@nbchurch.com

      If our appearance says something about ourselves, what are we trying to say?  For me, I try to say that I'm approachable.  If I go to a party or to any other social setting, I try to figure out the range of attire from casual to formal, and I try to dress right in the middle.   At church, this rule also applies.  For instance, if I know that there will be people in the audience wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and sandals, but that there are also people in slacks and dress shirts, then I might wear jeans, a button-up shirt, and my trusty sliders (look at this link - these are the best shoes I've ever owned)  urlLink SLIDERS .  (Click on "casual", then click the "Sliders".)  I do this not to make any sort of fashion statement, but to hopefully make the attender feel comfortable.  If I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and the attender is dressed more formal, that might make them uncomfortable, and vice versa.    Just something else to think about.

      Okay, I admit it.  I'm way out of shape.  I'm 6'3", and according to my ideal height/weight chart, I should have a nine-year old standing on the scales with me to make them read what they do.  So, I'm doing something about it.  I'm starting the Slim-Fast diet (again).  For those of you who were around me at the time, you'll know that I lost almost 40 pounds doing the Slim-Fast program about a year ago.  So, I'm back on track.  This morning I left my house at 5:50am and walked five miles.  I know, I know, it's nothing that the Olympic Committee will be impressed by, but hey - you have to start somewhere.  I say all of this to let you know that I've been doing some pondering.  If I am worship leader, and I am a "high profile" leader in my church, shouldn't I be the one leading the way in health disciplines?  I want to be able to express simply by appearance that Jesus Christ is my Lord - not food.    Does appearance make a difference?  It shouldn't - but it does.  Just something to think about.

      As a worship leader, musician, and person, I realize that I live in a unique place emotionally.  Because I am an "artist-type", I tend to be really emotional, whether I show it to those around me or not.  As a musician, I appreciate the creative side of everything, and try to apply creativity to everything I touch.  I have to stop every now and then and remember that not everyone in the world is like me.  There are different personality types, different worldviews, and different emotions.  As a worship leader, this is crucial.  Not everyone is going to worship like I do, and not everyone will experience God the way I do.  I could sing the chorus to the song "Holy" about 80 times in a row and think it was the best worship ever...  Holy, holy, God almighty, who was and is to come God of glory, You're so worthy, all the saints bow down  Holy is Your name in all the earth Righteous are Your ways, so merciful Everything You've done is just and true Holy, holy God are You, holy holy, God are You"  However, while I'm singing and playing my guts out on this song, someone in the audience could be thinking "holy cow - how long is this stupid song?".  What are we doing as worship leaders to experience worship in ways that are not familiar or even preffered to us?  If we get stuck in a worship vaccuum, we become ineffective.    Something to chew on.  Sam Middlebrook

      Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, it's Thursday, and I haven't written anything for a few days.  Sorry.  I'm sure that you've all been aimlessly wandering about your local neighborhood banging your head against any hard surface that is within reach while subconsciously humming the greatest hits of Poi Dog Wandering  (you might have to look that up) trying to vent the frustration that you feel at not being able to read anything new on this site.  There are some worse things that could happen, so let me list a few...  1. Having to listen to concert of Andy Griffith singing your favorite U2 songs.  (Think "With or Without You")  2. Being forced to watch the same episode of Beavis and Butthead for three days straight.  3. Richard Simmons could move in with you.  4. You could become the next DC Comic hero, only your name would be "Limp-Legged-Llama", and your wool could be pink.  5. Ralph could start building the commune in your yard (inside joke for a few readers)  6. You could go the vending machine at work, and instead of getting a Snickers, you unknowingly select the Sara Lee Muffin of Death.  7. I could keep writing like this every day!  (wouldn't that be marvelous?)  Enough random frivolity. Have a great day.  Sam

      We've all done it before.  You know the feeling.  You are in the middle of the slower portion of your worship set, and you find yourself  thinking...  - I wonder how this song would sound if Art Garfunkel played it? - What am I having for dinner? - Why did I wear these pants? - I wish I had a G&L ASAT Classic instead of this pawn shop Gibson rip-off guitar.  urlLink (G&L Guitars)  - Who's that in the third row with the weird hair? - I've got finish that project for work!  You may have your own little thought paths that mind likes to meander down, but I think you're getting the picture.  It happens so often when we are in front of people.  We lose sight of what it is that we are doing.  I find that every time I experience this, when I look back at how I have managed my time that day or even in the previous week, that I haven't been living out the spiritual disciplines of a worship leader.    Can I honestly ask people to give their hearts and minds over to God in worship when I'm not doing it in my own life?  I'll be talking about this in the next few posts.  Feel free to e-mail me with your thoughts.  Sam

      Wow.  You guys have some pretty strong feelings about what I should write on this site.  For those of you who know me personally, you know I'm pretty laid-back.  If what I wrote in my last post offended you, I apologize, but hey - lighten up.  When you enter into my webpage, you're going to get me and my thoughts.  It's like coming to my house.  I'm going to be hospitable and gracious, but I'm also going to relax as well.  That being said, I intend to have fun on this site as well as discuss worshipping our Creator.  If you're looking for a nugget of wisdom every time you visit here, you are looking at the wrong site, and for sure the wrong person.    Anyway, tomorrow, I'm going to start writing about the role of worship leader when you're not on stage.  It's the most important part.  I pray that what I'll share will be helpful, and will hopefully spark some thought and some dialogue.  See you tomorrow, Sam By the way - I'm still learning how to do this HTML thing, so sorry for my discombobulated site.

      Okay, this is getting ridiculous.  When I started this site, my intent was to have about fifteen people read it - those who I am in the process of teaching to lead worship, and those who were a part of my Oasis Worship Team.  It turns out that people are reading this site because they sing songs I've written at their church or because I've been to their fellowship to lead worship.  I've been getting e-mails from a few of these readers who think I'm arrogant for publishing such a page saying things like "who are YOU to say that you know how to best lead worship?".    If you visit this site and you don't like what you read, simply stop reading it.  This site is for a purpose, and I believe it is being effective for its intended purpose.  To quote a pastor friend of mine, "Don't go away mad, just go away".  This is the last time I'll address this on this site, and if you send me e-mail on this subject, know that it will be deleted and not responded to.  Okay, back to business....  We've been talking about the role of the worship leader when we're not on stage. Today, I want to talk about the musical aspect of it.  A very important but easy-to-overlook part of leading worship is rehearsal on your instrument, be it the drums, the guitar, or your voice.  The reason why this is so important is that the last thing you need to be thinking about while leading worship is music.  If you spend your time thinking "we're in the key of E, so I should bridge the F#m7 and C#m7 chords with an E/B and a Cdim", then I applaud your knowledge of theory (in this case, on the guitar), but your thoughts should be on God, and playing to glorify Him.  You should be working on that bridge in you practice time at home so that once you get on stage, it comes effortlessly.  For the vocalist, this means knowing your range very well.  If you're singing the song "Famous One", and you know (for a tenor) that you can hit a high G effortlessly, than you know that you can sing the harmony parts in the chorus.  Othetrwise, you spend your time thnking "can I hit this note?", and your thoughts are in the wrong place.  You don't have to know every note of every song by heart, but by reahearsing when you are not on stage, worship becomes more of a gift to God instead of a musical workout.  By spending time working on our various musical crafts, we are better prepared to lead worship with our hearts, minds, and souls.  I'd love to know what you think.  Drop me an e-mail.

      When not examining our inner rock star, we have been talking about who a worship leader should be off the stage.  I appreciate the e-mails that I've gotten - it's lets me know that I'm striking a chord with you about being musicians. (every pun intended)  Today, I want to ask you to think with me about freshness.  A few of you are worship leaders in fellowships that cherish traditional liturgy, and your worship services look the same from week to week.  For those of you in that situation, I praise God that you are able to find Him through those avenues, and that your christian fellowship feels the same.  However, I need to speak to those in the audience who experience God in a unique way when there is innovation and freshness in the worship service.  A mentor of mine once told me that he regularly visited three churches when he was not leading worship.  This person happens to be from the Baptist tradition of churches, and so he would visit a Catholic church, a Church of Christ (who usually worship with only singing), and a local Pentecostal fellowship.  He told me that as a worship leader, he found that visiting the Catholic church renewed his sense of reverance towards God.  He would visit the Church of Christ in order to remember that his instruments were not always crucial in worship, and he would visit the Pentecostal church in order to be stretched in learning how to move with the Spirit in a service.  Now, my friend didn't use liturgy in his own worship services - He rarely led a song without playing his instrument, and he doesn't have a charismatic bone in his body, but he did these things in order to break out of the bubble that he was placed in as a worship leader.  I think it is vital that we get out and experience worship in different venues.  If we stay only in our place of worship, then our worship will always look and feel the same.  If you want to grow as a worship leader, be sure that you are not only allowing yourself to be led in worship by someone esle, but try to find a place outside of your typical fellowship and culture and get stretched a little bit.  Your worship life with be glad that you did.  Sam

      "Busyness is not an indication of effectiveness, but instead, it is a product of our own vanity and laziness.  On one heand, we keep ourselves busy because we want to believe that we are important.  The incredible hours, the crowded schedule, and the heavy demands on my time are proof to myself - and to anyone who asks - that I am, indeed, important." Eugene Peterson, from "The Contemplative Pastor" 1997  The busy lie is one of the biggest that the enemy tells.  We are pursuaded to think that is we fill our schedule up to overlapping, that we are living life the right way, squeezing every moment that we can out of our day.  We're wrong to think that.  As worship leaders, we should be the least busy people on the planet.  Sure, we have jobs to do, songs to prepare, guitars to re-string, keyboard patches to edit, and people that we need to meet with, but really - do we have that much that absoultely MUST be done - or things that we WANT to be doing?  I've been thinking about this a lot lately about what I need to spend my time doing.  As an individual who desired to lead worship, I can think of four main categories that my time needs to be spent in...  1. Spiritual Formation     - Setting aside a regular time for personal worship      - Being accountable to someone else for my spiritual growth     - Keep my priorities on loving my King  2. Family     - Spending both quality and quanity time with my wife     - Spending time at home with no expecation except to just be     - Leading my wife in a relationship in Christ  3. Musicianship     - Keeping my love for my instrument kindled     - To try to keep beoming a more versatile musician     - To learn all I can from the musicians I respect  4. Mentoring     - Making sure that I'm not the only one learning about worship     - Investing heavily in the lives of people who are gifted in worship     - Nurturing a trust among these individuals  If I spend my time in thses four categories, then I am doing well.  Why do I feel the need to fill my plate up so high that I forget what all I put on it?  Do you struggle with this?  Do you have any helpful thoughts?  I'd love to hear them.  Sam

      A few of you have been asking about writing worship songs.  From what I read in your e-mails, you're looking for magic formulas on how to write great worship songs.  I can't give you a formula for writing a great song, because there is simply not one.  For worshippers who want to use their natural ability to write worship songs, here's my advice...  There is only one you. There's no one else with your view of the world and what God is doing on the earth. Write honestly what is on your heart to God, and sing it to him in secret. Let that be your biggest reward. You are having a private audience with the King, the Father who loves you without measure!!! If that song is meant to have a wider audience, He is fully capable of arranging things without a huge amount of help from you. The best songs find their way out without a lot of effort by the songwriter. When I began to lead worship I never used any of my own songs. That came several years later, and began one song at a time. Be patient, but be willing to work hard. Never sing a song in public that you don't 'own' in private first, and make sure that the theology of what you are singing is based the Scriptures and on orthodox theology, not just your own experience, though if you are not 'living the song', you won't have much passion or authority to sing it.  Let me know what you think...

On the collegiate level, the Texas Longhorns are still on a roll.  On Saturday afternoon, I'll be lounging in my favorite green chair watching them beat the heck out of Oklahoma.  (hopefully)  Don't worry, I'll write more about worship stuff tomorrow, but you have to understand, it's football season!  By the way, I'm rooting for the Minnesota Twins to take it all this year.

      I hate computers. I returned back from an incredible trip to Bellingham, only to find that my laptop had thrown out the red carpet for the "klez" virus. My hard drive has been giving food and shelter to this very unwelcome guest for a while, just long enough to erase my ENTIRE hard drive.  I'm sitting at a different computer right now to write this.  I'm hoping to have everything back online within a couple of days.  I'm currently having to reinstall Windows and everything else on my computer.  I'm a little frustrated, because my backup disk has the virus on it, which means that my backup files are infected, so it looks like the last three years of my computing life are toast... Original songs, letters, e-mails, worship orders, databases, addressbooks, and yes, Tiger Woods Golf are all gone.  Why can't we all go back to just using pen, paper, and the Pony Express?

      Is Barry Bonds the greatest player in the history of baseball?  YES.  He's proving it in this series.  He is simply, the most feared hitter we've ever seen.  If you enjoy the game of baseball, then I hope you are enjoying watching this World Series, I have a feeling that is going to be a down-to-the-wire classic.

      I once invited a gifted vocalist to sing as part of the worship team for a conference. Shortly before the event, she became ill, and arrived unable to sing a note. A few weeks later, I received this e-mail from her. (Thanks for letting me share this, Brianne)  "I experienced God in a unique way this year, and I wouldn't trade being sick for the world...I pretty much whispered through worship.  Not being able to bring anything musically to the party did not distract or disappoint me at all (by His grace). In fact He allowed me to experience worship from my heart in a richer way!  He is so faithful to dig a little deeper, bring it around again, and show me another layer of pride resident in my heart... He can take my voice away and teach me more about how to worship Him."  Her attitude exemplifies the heart of a true worshiper.   How do I know I've been worshiping God? If I've been playing my instrument in front of lots of people on Sunday morning? If I've been singing worship songs? If I feel "caught up" in the music? A more accurate assessment comes from looking at the way I've been investing my free time, my money, and my thoughts.  As Mark Dever, pastor of Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., once said, "Christ's sacrifice didn't just secure our happiness while singing, but our holiness in living."  That doesn't mean it's wrong for me to present my music to God as an act of worship. In fact, I should do that. However, the worship doesn't stop when the music does. It continues as I listen to the message, speak to my friends when the meeting is over, or help tear down the equipment.   We're always worshiping something or someone. We can't help it. The question is WHO will we worship at each moment?   Every Christian musician is called, by God's mercy, to see worship as a way of life.  Blessings, Sam

      This is weird.  I haven't written in a week, and so I feel like my first post after a long break should include something incredibly profound and life-changing, but I'm struggling to think of anything important to say.   For all of you guitar players out there, I stumbled into a new tuning in my practice session this morning.  Low to high, tune your strings to CGCGCE.  When you strum it open, you get the root chord for the key of C.  It's a lot of fun once you start getting into it.  A great example of this tuning is Dave Wilcox's song "Rusty Old American Dream" (see the link at the bottom right of this page to his website).  I wonder if Jesus ever had fun with who he was when he was a kid.  I mean, think about it.  If you're Jesus, wouldn't you have frustrated every other kid when they hid something behind their backs and made you guess which hand it was in?  What about the old hide-and-seek game, and Jesus ALWAYS found you.  Do you think he had fun with this.  What about when someone came up form behind him and covered his eyes and said "Guess who"? , and he did... consistantly.   Sorry, I think I'll stop while I'm ahead.

      Well, it is official.  I have resigned from my position as Worship Arts Minister at New Beginnings Church here in Houston, Texas.  My wife and I (along with our dog Lucy and our unborn son Levi) will be moving to the Skagit Valley area of Washington State. I will be taking a position as Associate Pastor for Christ the King Community Church, whose website I have listed in the "churches" portion of my links on this site.  I will be driving the moving truck from Houston, Texas to Burlington, Washington on the first week of December, and will start work on Sunday, December 8.  I am very, very excited about my new job, as it revolves around the mentoring process.  Please pray for Shannon and I as we make a lot of transitions over the next few months.  Over the course of eight weeks, we will have...  - resigned from a job - sold our house (hopefully) - moved across the country - started a new job - moved in with her parents - moved out of her parents house and into an apartment (again, hoping the house sells) - delivered our first son, Levi Coltrane Middlebrook  That's a lot to deal with in a short amount of time.  We covet your prayers.  Sam sam@nbchurch.com

      I want to talk about worship leading dynamics, and so I'm going to break up the worship leading experience into three phases.  PHASE ONE - The "Pre" Phase.....  - Get in the habit of rehearsing personally before you rehearse with the team. This helps for a quicker learning of the songs together. It also helps the team have a sense of security in you as a leader. If you know the songs well and memorize all of the guitar progressions, then they will know that they can trust you musically.  - Be well prepared for rehearsal in other ways as well. Make sure the vocalists have water, pencils, and the lyrics they need. Make sure the band has all of the chord charts and something to write with. Paper is cheap, so have a few extras of everything just in case.  f you are like me, and your struggle to keep up with paperwork filing, delgate it to someone who is naturally organized. I had a worship team member one time who spent time every week in my office organizing and working on files, and it was one of the biggest blessings!  - Be sure that your techincal crew knows what to expect. Give the technical director written cues on what you would like for sound, lighting, and powerpoint. Also, be sure that you sound engineer knows exactly what you need as far as inputs, cabling, etc...  - Select songs that you love to play. If you are confident in your musicianship and you are enjoying yourself, chances are, people will follow.  - Leave room for the Spirit. Don't cram your worship set so full that there is no room for alteration or change. There should be a small space to spend time in spontaneous worship, don't neglect that ministry.  - Memorize the songs. Memorize the songs. Memorize the songs.  - Make small musical steps every week with your team. You work with an incredible group of artists. Artists need freshness and challenge. Don't bore them with the same stuff over and over. Re-vamp your songs. For instance, take the song "Cry of My Heart" and re-arrange it from 4/4 raggae song to a 6/8 jazz song. It's fun, and your band will love the challenge.  - Lastly, make it a habit to be on constant communication with the pastor or the leader of the assembly. They have the ultimate responsibility for equipping the saints, and your role is aid them.  PHASE TWO - The "Present" Phase...  - Sing and play confidently and clearly. When you lead vocally, lead! Don't mumble through words, and make sure that the lead melody is the strongest sound of the whole team.  - Keep your eyes open the majority of the time. If you want to know what God is doing in the midst of your assembly, keep your eyes open when you pray so that you can see waht ministry is being done. For instance, if during a prayer, you see a group of people laying hands on someone, then you know that you should keep the musical climate appropriate.  - Use simple signals with your worship team and technical team so that they know exactly what you are trying to communicate. A good technical crew will have their eyes on you, waiting for a cue to change something, so have pre-arranged signals that are not distracting to the worship.  - Keep eye contact with your Senior Pastor. You don't lead in a vacuum, you lead as a team. Your Pastor is called to have a sense of the overall pulse of the gathering, and it is crucial that you be able to communicate with him. You're not just a maverick, doing your own little musical thing... You walk in submission to those God has given primary oversight, and your gifts and leadership follow suit.  PHASE THREE - The "Post" Phase...  - Recieve all input graciously, whether it is positive or negative. Regardless of age, sex, musical experience, or taste, all input can teach you something. Be humble and learn from it.   - Learn from your mistakes. Get together that evening with your team and your techincal crew, and talk about any glitches that happened so that they won't happen again. Try videotaping yourself sometimes. I did this and learned that I usually don't stand still for longer than two seconds, and that it was really annoying! Watch yourself on tape and learn from it.  - Take the initiative to ask your Pastor how he felt the worship time went, and if they have any input. He will respond to your teachability with some valuable insight and perspectives. Take the criticism with humility, and take the praise with even more humility.  - Always, Always, Always give the glory to God after you have led. I have a friend who says that glory is like radiactive material... It's powerful stuff, but if you hold it for too long, it will kill you. Take the time to give the glory back to God!

      And, in the pointless category of this website....  (from CNNSI's daily "SportsToday" newsletter)  We've all done it -- as kids mostly -- to settle such things as who's gonna get that last piece of pizza. But nobody does it as well as Pete Lovering. The Toronto man is the world's top Rock, Paper, Scissors player -- and he has $1,200, a video game system and a gold medal to prove it. Lovering bested more than 250 adults to win first prize in the World Rock Paper Scissors Society's first international championship last weekend in Toronto. For the uninitiated, RPS, as it's known to players, consists of three simple gestures: A clenched fist (rock), two extended fingers (scissors), and a flat hand with your palm down (paper). Two players each throw down one of the gestures. A rock smashes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers a rock. While most consider RPS a game of chance, championship co-organizer Douglas Walker said there's more to it. "The patterns start to emerge fairly quickly and the good players know what they're looking for," he said. "You know by facial expression. Some of them are more concerned with looking at the flexing of the hand." Exactly, said Lovering. Well, sort of. "I call it mindfulness of being, which is if you think about what your throw's going to be before you throw it, the other player can pick it up," he told the Ottawa Citizen. "Just focus strictly on what you're going to throw and if you throw what's right for you, it'll be the right answer."

      God's faithfulness is incredible.  We have begun the process of selling our home!  The potential buyers have agreed on an offer, and we will be signing the initial paperwork today.  After an official home inspection, and after the all the financing stuff is legitimized, we should be closing on our home on December 13th.  God is amazing.  Period.  Thanks for praying.

They have accepted our counter-offer of price and terms, but on one condition... they have one other home that they just heard about that they want to go see.  So, please be praying that they will buy our house.  It will not only be a HUGE financial relief, but also a confirmation for us as walk through a huge season of change in our lives.  Thanks for beng faithful friends.  I'll keep you updated, as I should hear something tonight.

      It's 7:30 am on Thanksgiving morning.  I woke up and the first thing I saw was my wife, Shannon.  God has blessed me with the most amazing wife.  Shannon is an incredible partner in my ministry.  She is an intercessor, and administator, and an organizer (and what musician doesn't need an organizer around them?).  I put my arm around her, and immediately, our unborn son Levi started kicking my hand.  He'll be on the scene in around three weeks, and I am in awe of how God allows life to give life.  I am blessed also with a son, who I am excited to meet.  I walked out of our bedroom and saw my guitar case.  I'm blessed that my wife sacrificed a couple of years ago, and bought me a Taylor 514ce, an acoustic guitar that I love. I never thought I'd own a Taylor!  I then turned the corner and saw my mother-in-law, Nancy, working in the kitchen preparing the day's food.  I was reminded that I'm blessed with family on both sides of the marriage that love the Lord and work hard to contribute great things to the Kingdom and to the Church.  After a quck visit with Nancy, I walked into the family room and got online ot check my e-mail.  I was reminded of the great friend and mentors that God has placed in my life to help shape and sharpen me.    I'm the most blessed person alive, and I hope that I don't forget it.  I pray that my worship life is one that reflects the gratefulness that I have to my Creator for blessing me with both essential things and great gifts.

      Well, it's time to move.  Tomorrow morning, my dad and I will drive a little under 3,000 miles from Houston to Burlington, Washington.  Due to winter weather and the weight of the moving truck/car in tow, we will be taking I-10 east to L.A., and then turn north on I-5 until we get to Burlington. I'll be out of pocket until Friday when we (hopefully) arrive safely in Washington State.  Please pray for Shannon, that Levi won't want to come out for another two weeks, and also pray for my safety.  Lanny Hughes, welcome to my site.  Happy reading, my good friend.

      Something to chew on...  "It {our current philosophy in worship} is an attempt at worship relevance that has gone way beyond the original intent of market application to market servitude.  And when worship becomes a pawn of marketing, it ceases to have much to do with the expression and experience of a living, intimate relationship with the true God.  In reality, it ceases to have much to do with God at all.  Rather, it degenerates into a colossal Monopoly game: warm bodies substitue for real estate, and the net worth of both senior pastor and worship director rises or falls with the final attendance tally."  taken from the first chapter of "Worship Evangelism" from Sally Morgenthaler  Ouch.  That hurts.  Sam

We're doing a Christmas Outreach service, and our band is gearing up with songs like "Feliz Navidad", "Winter Wonderland" and "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" (heavy on the Rockin') for fun, and we're also doing the standard Christmas hymns.  This should be a lot of fun.  I'll update you on how it went next week.  Sam

      One of the most potentially gifted worship leaders I've ever met struggles with addiction.  He regularly attends AA meetings, and wishes he didn't smoke so much.  He loves sweets and caffeine, and laments that, too.  God is going to use him in ways that he doesn't even fully realize yet.  I spent time praying for this individual today, and it dawned on me how critical we can be as humans, especially those of us who are saved.  We tend to look down on anyone who struggles with the things that we have under control.  I don't crave a drink every day, but I'm tempted with dishonesty every day.  This worship leader that I'm talking about is one of the most honest, genuine people I've ever met.  We choose to not beat each other up over our shortcomings, we just love on each other.  As worship leaders, it's not our job to hold ourselves to an unattainable standard.  We can't constantly be allowing ourselves to be caught in the Enemy's trap of thinking that we're just not good enough.  Sometimes, it is the very brokenness that we despise that God WANTS us to have in order to be more effective in our giftings.  To the worshipper that I'm writing about, if you read this. I love you.  God loves you unconditionally, and you'll be suprised when He uses your weaknesses to show His strength as you grow as a worship leader.  Sam

      What is the point of worship leading?  Is it to make sinners into worshippers, or is to make Christians into singers?  I've been thinking about that a lot lately.  I've come to the conclusion that, within the context of my church culture, my job in leading worship is to encourage sinners to worship.  I'm going to do my best to stop trying to make singers out of Christians.  There's no reason why I should spend my time worrying about the musical compentancy of my church fellowship, instead I should be considering how I can better encourage them into greater depths of worship when they're not at church. Does musical quality act as a form of worship?  Of course it does.  Is it the ultimate goal?  Absolutely not.  I'm tired of worship leaders who encourage their fellowship to "sing this verse really loud" or to "sing with all your voice".  I used to be one of them, but for the last few years, I've not done it.  I was reminded this week of the importance of not doing this when I had a really good conversation with my worship leading mentor.  Musical competence/performance is not the goal of worship, but a heart exposed before the heart of God should be.  What do you think?  Sam sam@ctkonline.com

      Because of Christmas, I've been thinking a lot about the life of Christ.  Since I'm anticipating becoming a parent any day now, I've been thinking a lot about Jesus as a baby and as a little boy.  I put myself in the shoes (or in this case, sandals) of Christ, and I just smile.  I wonder if Jesus played any of the fun tricks that I would have played.  Let me list a few...  1. When someone grabbed my lucky rock and put it behind their back saying "Guess which hand it's in!", I would have.  Correctly.  Every time.  2. Do you remember going to school and not liking your lunch?  I would have just grabbed the lunch of the kid next to me an multipied it until I got full.  3. What about when Jesus and his cousin John went swimming and tried to race across the lake?  If I were Jesus, I would have just run across the water.  4. The teenage years would have been a lot easier for sure.  If it was the day of school pictures or the prom, I could have healed my own acne.  I'll stop.  This is not very funny.  Welcome to my brain.  Sam

      Saturday night was great!  We setup in a school cafeteria: acoustic guitar, keyboard, bass, electric guitar, drums, and three vocals.  We had a blast with the music - but it was different for me, since I was standing three inches from a ride cymbal!    The night overall was great.  We had 87 people come out for the service, the majority of them first-time guests!  I'm looking forward to starting services on Saturday, January 4th.  Thanks for being in prayer over this.

      Yesterday, my pastor, Dave Browning gave a message called "A State of Grace".  He compared our relationship to God like being at the bottom of a ladder, with God being at the top.  Dave said that we are all climbing to get to God, and that some will be able to climb higher than others, but that no one can get all the way to the top.  He said that no matter how high we get, God still has to climb down towards us so that we can be touched by Him.  He then said that we tend to focus on being better ladder climbers, when we should rather enjoy that God climbs our way.  I realize that I'm not conveying the message that he gave to you very well, but it was an incredible lesson, and one that is affecting my worship life in a big way this morning.  I've been taught all of my life that God wants me to be a strong Christian.  Yesterday, I heard that God won't make me strong, instead, He delights in my weakness because it is in that weakness that He is strong.  God isn't strong in my strength, He's strong in my weakness.  I grew up thinking that God had things for me to do out requirement, but instead, I'm learning to do them out of love in response to His grace.  Sam

      "Worship is about relationship. Relationship means that life is exchanged. In other words, a lifestyle of worship is one in which I open up myself in intimacy to my God. And in turn, He opens up His heart in intimacy to me! Life is exchanged, life is produced. A vital component of that lifestyle of worship is honesty. God's Word tells us that we will know the truth and that truth will set us free. I honestly admit to the Father that I cannot save, deliver or help myself, but He can. In that exchange of honesty, He brings health and freedom to my soul, and my natural response is one of gratitude and worship. That is, to me, the bare essentials of a lifestyle of worship." --- Dennis Jernigan

      Good morning everybody. It's about 7:00am, and I've been going through my usual "ritual" to prepare my heart to lead worship this morning. I thought I would share with you some of what I do.  I hope you find this helpful.  I do want to make it very clear that what I do works... FOR ME.  It might not be what works for you.  We have three Sunday morning worship services, the first one beginning at 9:00. Being a morning person, I like to get up early (around 5:00) and go to the worship center where we hold services. I set up my guitars (my electric takes about 20 minutes), and then I retreat to my office. I spend this time on my knees or in some other posture that I find to helpful for me to pray. After I've spent some time with the Lord in prayer, I begin to read scripture. I usually start out with a few psalms and then go to the OT, and then read 1 Cor. 12, which I read every time before I lead worship.  Once I've done this, I go back out to stage and make sure that everyone else's gear is setup and ready, and then I stand in the spot where each of the worship team members will be. I pray over each spot and for each person who will take that place. I pray for the drummer, the bass player, the keyboard player, the other guitarist, and each vocalist. I pray that God would draw them very close to Himself as we lead worship together, and I pray that our worship would be focused on God alone and that it would engage our fellowship in worship.  After I do this, I walk through each row of the worship center and pray over the whole building, asking God to come in power and to show Himself in ways that only He can.  Once I have done this, the band usually arrives, and we begin to pray together. We then usually have a short time of sharing Scripture together, and then we rehearse briefly before the services begin. (we also have a seperate rehearsal on Thursday nights).  I find that the time I spend on Sunday when no one is around is the sweetest time of my week.  Let me know what you think.... jsmiddlebrook@hotmail.com  Sam

      Obedience to Christ  By John Wimber, founder of the Vineyard Movement (and one heck of a jazz guitarist)  How can we obey someone we don't trust? We can't and we don't. Trusting God is foundational to joyful obedience. Obedience is carried out after we've made a total commitment of our lives to Christ. We consecrate our wills to live for him no matter what the mitigating emotions or circumstances, which really is the first act of obedience for every Christian. And we joyfully serve him not out of some grim sense of duty or pride, but because of the love affair we can have with the Father through Jesus.   Sometimes we are tempted to wonder if we can obey in a complete enough way to become like Jesus. After all, we are imperfect in our trusting of God as well. When we look at ourselves, we think, "We'll never make it." (Isa. 30:15)   But when we look at Him and His Word, we know we will. It wont be by our doing but by our surrendering. In essence, obedience can be defined as utter surrender to the one we trust. In regards to the clay and the potter: What does the clay have to do except stay put while the potter molds and makes it into the thing of beauty that He desires?   Food for thought.....

      I'm sitting at an internet station in a coffeeshop/ice cream parlor in Friday Harbor, which is on San Jaun Island in Washington State.  My parents are in town to get to know their new grandson, and so we've been spending the day leisurely meandering around the village.    My dad has been in ministry for over three decades, and while we were standing on the street, my dad some something that has been making me think.  He said "Ya know, Sam, I love little places like this, but people like you and me need to be where the people are".  He was saying that because we are gifted to work wth people and to do ministry, it is almost our duty to place ourselves in locations where there are plenty of people to minister to.  As an introverted personality, my tendency is stay away from the crowd.  To me, four people is almost too many to hang out with at once - I prefer intimacy in relationship rather than breadth.  What my dad said today has been challenging me.  Most of us artistic/musician types prefer our space.  But if we are called to do our ministry in a way that affects the lives of people - maybe having too much space is a bad thing.  Something to think about...  Sam sam@ctkonline.com

      My friend Ron Pai told me that I needed a new post on my site, so I started thinking, what it is that Ron inspires me to write about?  And then, I thought back to the time when he and I were in the same band, I remembered one thing that Ron really excelled at creating....  The Pocket.    If you're a musician, you probably can't articulate what it is, but you'd know it the moment you were in it.  It's that addicting time when playing in a group or a band when the bass, drums, and lead rhythm instrument are all in a tight groove, and they create space, or "a pocket" in which to solo or play over.  Sometimes the space lasts only one measure, sometimes it's two beats, and sometimes, it lasts a whole verse.  For example:  Shout to Lord, all the earth let us sing (pocket for two beats) Power and Mjesty praise to the King  In worship, the pocket is extremely important.  It allows for the lead guitar, horn, or vocalist to have room for expression.  It allows the audience to take a break from singing and just listen.  This is extremely important, because you can't have "the pocket" unless your big three instruments (bass, drums, and lead rhythm - usually guitar) are playing well together.  If you are a worship leader, try to take a few rehearsals with just these three instruments.  You'll be suprised at how tight you can become if you spend time working on it.  Until next time, Sam

      Last night, I laid in bed and my mind was awake even though my body was exhausted.  My mind wandered to odd subjects like "Why don't they make edible candles so that we don't have to worry about getting wax on the frosting", and I even spent some time considering the Newtonian Laws of physics, where he stated that space and time are an absolute.  For whatever reason, the theory of time travel has been captivating to me lately.   I'm not sure why I'm sharing these thoughts, but I feel like I should post something today, and this is all I can think of.  Sam P.S.  Go Raiders and go Bucs!

      Sorry, I'm still thinking about this whole relational thing.  If I were to try to write down my thoughts right now, I would only confuse myself and annoy you while you tried to make some sense out of my blabbing.  So, I'll just tell you that the Raiders are going to win the Super Bowl.

      Realtionship, to me, is one of the primary goals of the Church.  Christ came to us, and initiated a relationship, and in turn, I believe that one of our primary goals as Christ followers is to begin and maintain deep, effective relationships with other believers.  Community is a word that we throw around a lot here at Christ the King.  We call ourselves a community church.  I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about how I as a pastor and as a worship leader can do more to create authentic community in the circles of people that I walk in.  I can't really articulate what's bouncing around in my brain at the moment, but I wanted to say that I'm thinking a lot about community and how we as a Church can do better at forming it.  I'll write more on Tuesday.  Check back.  Sam sam@ctkonline.com

      Like I said earlier (way, way earlier) I think that relationship is one of the primary goals of the Church.  If this is true, then I think it changes the way that I operate as a pastor and as a part of my church fellowship.  In light of this concept, my job is try not to facilitate programs or lead ministries, my primary role becomes fostering relationships, allowing those relationships to form into ministries.  So far, we've been doing it backwards - we establish ministries and then hope to from relationships out of them.  I propose that we should be doing to the opposite.  I'm tempted to go into detail about how this plays out, but I'm actually going to experiment with this for the next month with the church that I pastor and chronicle the happenings on this site.  I'd love to know what you think.  Sam sam@ctkonline.com

      Look at a seed.  By itself, it won't grow.  It needs soil, water, sun, and other elements to make it grow into a plant.  However, if you combine the perfect combination of soil, water, and light but have no seed, then you will not produce the result that you are wanting, either.  In thinking about relationships within the church, I've really found one thought that has stuck with me as truth.  Relationship is the essence of church.  Without ministires and spiritual gifts, the church wouldn't exist.  But, take a bunch of ministries and throw in some spiritual gifts without relationship and see what you get - you get an organization, not a church.  In leading this church plant, I've been focusing on three primary relationships.  For the sake of privacy, we'll change the names, and I'll tell you that I'm trying to form relationship with Jon, Jerry, and Jenny.  Jon is a blue collar worker who loves the Lord.  He loves to get his hands dirty.  He loves to be a "behind the scenes" worker, and he is great at organizational thought. I wanted to give him a position in our leadership group, give him a title, and make it official.  Instead, I just asked him to what came naturally to him.  I told him to come about an hour early to church and to find stuff to do that: - he enjoyed - he thought was essential to the church After each service, I meet with him individually to ask him how he enjoyed his time with the church and I ask him if there is anything that I should know about.  I also spend time each week with him over coffee at the local Starbucks.  Jerry is the opposite of Jon.  Jerry is a people person.  He doesn't think organizationally or structurally.  He just loves people.  A gifted pray-er, he loves to pray over people.  I asked him to come an hour early to church and to do what came naturally to him.  I told him to do whatever: - he enjoyed - he thought was essential to the church. After each service, I meet with him individually to ask him who he enjoyed his time at church.  I also eat breakfast with him once a week.  Jenny has a little bit of both peronalities in her.  She operates equally with her heart and with her head. She loves kids.  I told her to come one hour early to church each week.  I told her to do whatever came naturally to her.  I asked her to do: - what she would enjoy doing - what she thought was essential to the church. After each service, I meet with her and ask her how she enjoyed her time with her church.  She also comes to meet with me at my office once a week.  Jon, Jerry, and Jenny are all common people.  They don't have educations beyond high school, and they don't see themselves as leaders in the church.  However, they operate quite competently as my church staff.    Jon is my Director of Operations.  He oversees everything that's not associated with people.  From setup and tear down to coffee, bulletins, and bathrooms, Jon oversees every physical operation of our church.  He doesn't think this a big deal, he just does the things that come easy to him.    Jerry is a Pastor.  He doesn't think himself as one, but he is my guy for Pastoral Care.  People tend to go to him first when they have prayer needs.  When we have people in the hospital, Jerry gets the phone call instead of me.  He thinks nothing of it, he's just doing what comes natural to him.  Jenny is my Children's Pastor.  She has taken over our enitre children's ministry, and things in that area are going better than I could have ever imagined.  She doesn't have a title but people call her for any need or question that they have about kid's ministry.  She doesn't think much of it, she's just doing what she thinks is fun and what needs to be done for the church.  I have a growing, unpaid, compentent staff.    They just don't know it  .  They're just my friends from church.  Sam

      "Many worship leaders can't name a single book on the theology of worship. Most denominations (admirably) require preachers to pursue rigorous seminary studies before preaching. Yet we require of worship leaders only that they be willing to attend a single rehearsal or committee meeting. We would do well to lovingly challenge our worship  leaders to grow in the knowledge and love of God."

      The only word that I can think of that would describe the situation is... Nightmare.  Last night, after a worship service, I went into a side room adjacent to our stage.  I had my guitar strapped around me, and the lights were off.  I tripped over a ladder that I couldn't see was there (and normally isn't there), and fell over it, landing squarely on my guitar.  I've been playing guitar for 5 years now.  I started out with some cheap guitars, and then I finally got my first Martin.  You guitar players know that Martin is a very nice guitar builder.  I then gave that guitar to my brother-in-law when I piurchased a Tacoma JK50, which was made of rare koa wood, and had many decorative features. After selling this guitar off, I bought the guitar of my dreams, the ultimate guitar, the pinnacle of luthier artwork (in my opinion, anyway) the Taylor!  Well, last night, as I landed squarely on the guitar, the guitar was destroyed.  The top is split severely in seven places.  The scalloped bracing is missing the two central (and most important) peices, and the back of the guitar is completely demolished, and now has fallen entirely off of the guitar.  (and now, a brief moment to collect my emotions...)  .....   .....   .....    .....   .....    Okay, so it's pretty depressing.  Our adminstrator is looking into the church's liability insurance covering the replacement cost.  Without insurance helping out, I'm up a creek without a paddle.  Sam

      One of the obstacles that I've had to overcome in the area of relational leadership is the area of precise execution.  I've come to grips with the fact that precision in our services and in our other ministries isn't a prime goal, in fact, it's not even a part of the equation.  I've led worship in places where precision is the prime focus.  This is not a bad thing!  I've been in places where we timed down to the second the transition times between songs, speakers, microphone exchanges, etc...  This creates a very tight presentation that is very appealing to the newcomer.  It comes across as if we spent a lot of time (which we did) preparing this service.  I basically have thrown that philosophy in the trash, at least, for my current situation.  We meet in a school.  We don't have a rehearsal.  We just get up and do it.  It gets messy at times, but we are relaxed, and I couldn't be happier about it.  Here are a two great things that this "laid back" philosophy allows us to do...         1.  In the middle of our service, we take a break for 5 minutes and do absolutely nothing.  This allows people time to refill their coffee (which they drink during the service), to get to know the people around them beyond just learning their name, and it allows our staff time to meet people.         2.  After my messages, I spend about 10 minutes taking questions.  This is my favorite time of the service each week.  It allows people to ask questions or add a comment.  We've made this a very safe place for people to ask real questions.  For example, two weeks ago, I used the word "covenant" in my teaching.  Afterwards, a lady stood up and said "I've never been to church before tonight.  Will you tell me what the word 'covenant' means?  At that moment, I realized what a unique community we are building in my church.   I'd love to know your thoughts.  Sam sam@nbchurch.com

      Be praying over the next few weeks for my good friend and fellow pastor  urlLink Wade Hodges .  He is beginning his teaching ministry at Garnett Church of Christ in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Garnett Church is one of global influence because it's annual ministry workshop that draws believers from all over the world.  Well known among the Church of Christ fellowship, this church plays a key a role in leading other churches in advancing the Kingdom.  Wade, along with the Elders, is taking the helm of this church, so be praying for four things specifically...  1. That Wade would be able to teach with authority from the Spirit and through his true identity in Christ.  2. That he would learn quickly the in's and out's of the church, the staff, Oklahoma culture, etc...  3. That God would give him an incredible sense of "freshness" to his ministry.  4. That Wade's wife, Heather, would truly enjoy her new home, new church, new friends, etc...  Thanks for being in prayer with for this incredible teacher and friend.

      Good news!  Our church's insurance compnay is covering the replacement value of my Taylor... So I went out a bought a new one.  I took a lot of time thinking and researching this.  I looked at other guitar makers such as Goodall, Breedlove, Martin, Santa Cruz, and C. Fox, but to me, my experience with the Taylor company has been second to none.  So, I've bought another Taylor.   I thought about tonewoods.  I wanted Sitka spruce for my top, but I was thinking about going to Rosewood on the back and sides.  I was pleasently suprised when I picked up a Limited Edition Taylor 814 at Dusty Strings in Seattle, WA.  It is a limited edition because it's built out of a rare Mexican tonewood called "Cocobolo".  It has the bass response of Rosewood, but the clarity and high-end of maple.  I loved it when I first strummed it.  It is a beautiful instrument, with flamed maple binding around the entire guitar, including the neck and headstock.  I'm in love!  To make a long story short, I left with the guitar in my hands.  I go back later this month to get the electronics installed. After trying several different products, I decided on the  urlLink L.R. Baggs Dual Source  system.  I think I'm going to like it.  They don't have to drill any holes into the wood, and yet I still have onboard controls of my bass, treble, contour, and phase switch.  It is a small unit that clamps harmlessly onto the ring of my soundhole.  Gary Davidson is going to be my tech on this.  He recommended this system.  I had some doubts about the sound quality until I plugged it in.  Also, he played me a cd of David Wilcox (one of my guitar heroes) using it.  He had pictures of Wilcox using it on-stage, and so I was pretty much sold.  By the way, for all of you guiarists that live in Washington state,  urlLink Chris Proctor  will be in Bellingham, WA on Wednesday, April 9th at Mojo Music doing a Taylor Clinic.  I've been to many of these.  I've been to two put on by Chris - they're great, and you won't regret being there.  For info, contact Mojo Music in Bellingham.  Okay, enough for now.

      Okay, so one more post before I cross the border.  For all of you acoustic guitar players, here's a website for you.  I just couldn't stop readingit... I must have spent three hours just oogling.  It's an interview site of acoustic players.  It's pretty much a list of all my guitar heroes - Chris Proctor, Pat Kirtley, Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, Laurence Juber, and of course no acoustic website would be complete without my favorite dude on the planet, David Wilcox.  Yeah, yeah, yeah - I know, I'm one of those nerds who loves this stuff, but maybe you are, too.  Check it out...   urlLink Acoustic Artists Interviews

      I'm going to Canada this weekend to conduct a worship workshop at Prairie Chapel in BC.  It should be a fun time.  I'll let you know how it went when I get back on Sunday.   Here's an article by John Wimber that I found really interesting...   Two Traps By John Wimber   Though Christians believe that God’s Word is our unchanging standard, we still frequently stumble into traps set through the false belief systems of the world. Here are two traps that I’m referring too:   (1). First, there is intellectualism, the seeking of academic knowledge for knowledge’s sake. Christian’s fall into this trap when they “know” biblical truth but fail to practice it. In Matthew 23:1-11 Jesus tells the multitudes that the theology of the religious leaders is fine, but their deeds are inconsistent with their words. In other words, the religious leaders “know” but they don’t act on what they know. Why? Because they are looking for the approval of men, rather than from God (see verse 5).   The antidote for intellectualism is simple: there is no true “knowing” without doing.   (2). Second, there is outward obedience, the outward conformity to high ethical, moral, and biblical standards as a means to maturity. We do believe that disciples that practice generosity, prayer, Bible study and fasting also produce growth, but its also important that we are actively cooperating from our hearts with the work of the Holy Spirit. Though God is vitally concerned with obedience, he is more concerned with what motivates us. This is a matter of the heart, out of the core of our being.   In Matthew 21:28-32, Jesus rebukes the religious leaders who, by all outward appearances, conformed to the Old Testament law. He told them that the “tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of heaven ahead of you” (Matt. 21:31). Outward conformity to a set of laws is not enough; because- after hearing the truth- “you did not repent and believe Him” (Matt. 21:32).   The antidote for outward obedience is to develop a secret history with the Father.

      I really hope I'm not turning into one of those weird artist types.  I was just sitting playing my new Taylor 814-LTD.  I was playing through Michael Hedges' song, "Admiral", when I just wasn't getting the sound I wanted.  So I started playing harder and harder, until I shouted at my guitar. "COME ON!  PLAY!".  I expected something to happen.  I guess my guitar is still in shock - it's still adjusting to not being a tree anymore.  What's wrong with me?

      "If you leave your guitar alone for more than three days, it forgets who you are.  When you pick it back up, it won't recognize you, your hands, or the music that you are trying to get it to cooperate with.  It is a constant struggle for familiarity between you and your instrument that should drive rehearsal sessions."  Chet Atkins, as quoted in Guitar Player magazine, July 1986  You'll have to excuse me. I need to go play my guitars now...

      If you read this site often, then you know that simplicity is something that I value in worship.  Last night, I had a great reminder why.  I was playing electric and acoustic as a worship event in La Conner, WA, and I noticed a young man on the front row who had Downs Syndrome.  He was worshipping with everything he had!  He danced until he was out of breath during allof the fast songs.  During slow song, he was on his knees crying.  He gave everything he had to God.  I talked to him briefly afterwards.  He has no idea what the difference is between post, pre, and a-millenium positions.  He doesn't know the first thing about free will vs. predestination.  He's not sure what the difference is between our church and the Christian fellowship down the street.  He loves Jesus.... And that's all he needs to know.

       The Alluring Power of Performance By Andy Park, Worship Leader and Author   When Jesus captured my heart, music wasn’t in the picture. I was seventeen. I didn’t have any ambition to become a successful singer-songwriter, so it wasn’t something I had to surrender at that time. I played guitar, but it was only a sidelight. I didn’t spend my teenage years playing in bands, hoping to “make it big”. I was on a path to a much more typical middle-class American career.  But within months after meeting the Lord, new music began exploding out of me. I had never written music before. My first songs weren’t so great, and my first attempts to share my music were shaky. But as I gained confidence and skill, it was clear that my music was blessing people. When it became clear that I might actually “get somewhere” with my music, I began a journey of allowing God’s revealing light to illumine my motives for writing and singing.   A huge challenge for any musician is the constant tension between putting forth our best effort to write, play and lead worship while surrendering the results to God. Many musicians I know have spun out with frustration because they haven’t reached their musical goals in the church. It’s so easy to let personal goals become our all-consuming passion instead of serving others and trusting God for the results.

      I had a great time in BC.  It's fun to be able to take what experience I have and use it to help others to get where they want to go in worship.  It was a very intense time of teaching and training, and it to be honest, it drained me quite a bit.  But, now I'm back home and back to wotk at CTK.  I love my church.

      Last night was great!  I got to spend some time with a couple of other worship leaders as we sat in awe of  urlLink CHRIS PROCTOR  last night.  He was his usual amazing self.  You hear him play, and you just can't imagine all of that sound coming out of one six-string guitar.  After the workshop, I thought I would just give something a shot - I asked Chris if I could buy him a cup of coffee or something, and suprisingly enough, he said "yes"!  I had a great time getting to personally know this man whose music I love so much, and whose guitar teachings have done so much for my playing.  We got to talk about guitars (of course), but mostly, he just wanted to talk about life.  When he is on tour, he never gets to talk about anything but guitars, so to talk about family and life was nice change for him.  I have his e-mail address, and he said he wanted to keep in touch with me - cool!  For those of you who don't play guitar or know about Chris Proctor, then I apologize for rambling on and on about this, but for those of you who do know about him, then you completely understand....

      Tonight, I'll arrive an hour early at Mojo Music in Bellingham, Wa for the Chris Proctor workshop/concert.  I've been to three of these, and all of them have fun, informative, and very inspiring. Chris Proctor is a fingerstyle player, and majors in alternate tunings (no wonder I love his stuff!).    I always arrive really early to these events - it allows me to sit literally six feet from Chris while he plays and talks.  I take lots of notes.  All in all, I'm just really excited for tonight.

      Nothing will throw a wet blanket on a worshipping congregation faster than a chiding leader, or stress out a congregation like a stressed leader! The success of a worship time is not based on the outward demonstration or seeming 'energy' of the worship time -- it is what is going on inside of each heart that is the most important.  I've written on this before, but I had an experience about a month ago with a worship leader who was really excited about making sure that the audience sang loud.  If there is one thing that I've learned over the course of worship leading, it's that our job is not to get people to sing songs.  Our job is not make singers our Christians - it's to usher Christians into worship.  It's a hard lesson to learn, and if you've been through the worship leading mentoring process with me, then you know how strongly I feel about this.  If you're a worship leader, take some time today to pray about this.  Ask God to let you release your ideas about what worship should look like in the corporate setting - that way, you know when it's happening no matter what it looks like.

      Most of you know the story about my Les Paul.  It was given to me by a good friend of mine.  It's a 1999 Les Paul Studio.  I love the sound, but the darn thing won't stay in tune.  I used on Sunday, and I had to switch to acoustic after ONE SONG because the D, G, B, and E strings were all out of tune.  I wrote to my friend who gave me this guitar to try to ask if he wouldn't mind if I sold it in order to get something that will stay in tune.  I've got my eyes on a dream of a guitar.

      I've been thinking about something over the last few weeks.  This may not mean much to you at first, but just bear with me for a second.  I'm not going to puruse the electric guitar.  It's just not something that I really want to do.  I've realized that my passion is the acoustic, and playing it really, really well.  I think about all the time.  Last night, I was sitting on the second row at  urlLink Safeco Field  along the first baseline.  It was great game, and yet I missed most of the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings because I was thinking about how to better voice my chords in this new CGDGBC tuning.  It also hit me over the weekend at a worship event that I played keys at.  I've been playing piano for 20 years.  I'm great at it, but I spent the entire 2 hour set listening to the acoustic player.    I've realized that I play electric because it is "cool" in the eyes of most to play the electric.  There's something cool about playing note-for-note with The Edge.  Teenagers get really excited when you can play their favorite rock song just like it sound on the radio.  It was these reasons that caused me to want to play electirc.  I've realized that if I had my way, all I would play is my acoustic.  I've realized that my playing electric has been mostly driven by a desire to please others, and not my own creative drive.  So I'm just going to stop.  I have my Les Paul in case I need to fill in for the occasional church service, but from now on, I'm just going to focus on my acoustic and get as good as I can possibly get at it.  I'm doing it because it's going to satisfy an artistic need that I have instead of meeting the perceived expectations of others.  The majority of you who read this site are musicians and artists.  We also have one amazing storyteller who reads here as well.  The question that I ask all of you is this....  What are you doing in your artform that brings you incredible pleasure and joy?  What is that you are working on simply because you think others will like it?  Are you happy with what you're doing, or will your art benefit from a refocusing?  I'd love to know your thoughts....

      I've discovered a great new tuning, for those willing to try it.  Low to high - CGDGBC  It's very cool, very mysterious sounding.  Because of the half-step interval between the two highest strings, the chord voicings become very tight and intricate.  Enjoy the fun of figuring it out - I'm having a blast.  I'm writing an instrumental song with it.  I'll let you know how it goes.

      Yesterday morning, I was running some errands with my 3-month old son, Levi. We drove to the church building so I could take care of a few things. As I left, I noticed a homeless man looking pretty distraught, sitting against the brick wall of our church. I pulled my car up to the curb (which is about 20 feet away from the wall), and rolled down my window to see if he needed any help.  The man asked if he could talk to me for a minute. This is a normal thing that happens at churches, so I got out of my car, and walked to where he was. I approached him and said "Hey, what's going on?".  He then lunged at me, grabbed my left arm with incredible force and threw me face-first into the brick wall. I hit the brick with my forehead before I could even get my hands up. I'm 6'4", 285. It takes a lot of inertia to throw me as hard as he did. I was stunned, obviously, but the only thing running through my mind was "Levi is in the car!"   I turned around and saw the man running to my car, trying to steal it. With speed only paternal fear can muster, I ran to the man, and hit him from behind with everything I had. I rammed my fist into the back of his skull. He crumpled to the ground, but then amazingly, popped right back up and then took off running.  I didn't chase the guy, I just got in my car relieved that my little son was safe. I pulled around to the front of the building, and went inside. My assistant called 911 and the police came to take a report.  They said that this guy was obviously strung out on PCP or some other drug to be able to:  1. be able to throw someone my size that quickly and that strongly 2. get up from a blow to the back of the head and start running  Pretty scary stuff, but Levi is okay, and except for a swollen scar on my forehead, I'm fine.

      Easter was great.  If you add up all of the Christ the King loacations and service, we had over 9,000 people attend our church.  God is good.  He is faithful.  I'm speaking at two conferences over the next two weeks, plus speaking at my church and doing some worship leading.  Pray that I stay sane.  Sam sam@ctkonline.com

      I'm looking ahead to my weekend and I see that I'm entirely too busy. Over the course of five days, I will have preached six seperate sermons to three seperate audiences, led worship at four worship events in three different places, and will have recorded two worship videos - DVD's for training purposes within our church.  It's weekends like these that make me realize that I'm easily sucked into a lie. There's a lie that the enemy tries to get me to believe about my ministry. It's an equation that looks like this...  being busy in ministry = holiness   It's a lie. I'm pledging to never have another weekend like this. I'm learning to say no.  I've come to a realization lately that is very simple, yet very true. I am the only one that can be a husband to my wife and a father to my son. Just about anyone in the world can do what I do for my church. If you can play acoustic and electric guitar, and can pretend to know how to preach, then you can do my job.  But, no one can take my place as husband and father. the question that I keep asking myself is this... Am I living in a way that reflects this truth, or is my focus more on ministry than my on my family? It's a great question we should all be asking ourselves periodically.  Sam

      It's been sixteen days since I've written anything on this site.  I apologize to those of you who actually read this thing for thoughts on worship.  Lately, I've been thinking about rest.  This could be because I'm on three weeks of vacation at the moment.  I started out in Whistler, at a Four Seasons condo in the upper village.  Killer view, and a great place to hang out for a while.  Someone in our church gave us the use of their time-share for a few days, and it was very relaxing.  My wife and son are flying to Texas for three weeks, and I will be with them for one of those weeks.  I plan to spend my time in an RV at Larabee or Birch Bay State Park - getting quality time with my guitar, my books, and my dog.  I'm also going out of town to do some recording for four days.  I then will go to Texas for 10 days and eat as much cajun BBQ as I possibly can (frequency, not quantity).  For those of you who know and are interested, my workout/diet plan is working well, and I've lost 15 pounds so far.  Back to rest...  Without a period of rest, the periods of hard work and stress are unbearable.  As a worship leader, take the time you need to recharge yourself.  Even if you can't take three weeks off, take an afternoon and go to your favorite local guitar dealer and just hang out.  Go out in the woods, or on the beach. Take a walk.  Get away!  The refreshment is more than worth the effort it takes to actually get away from it all.  I'll see you in three weeks....  Sam

      If the Altoona Curve set a new low for wacky minor league baseball promotions next week, it won't be an accident. The Pittsburgh Pirates' Class AA Eastern League affiliate wraps up an 11-day homestand on July 14 with "Awful Night" at Blair County Ballpark. The first 2,500 fans will receive an awful giveaway prize -- one square foot of bubble wrap. Each of the 2,500 pieces will contain 576 bubbles, meaning fans will have the opportunity to pop a world-record 1.4 million bubbles in unison. The Curve also will honor the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the '62 New York Mets, the '90s Cincinnati Bengals and Prairie View A&M's football team that lost 88 straight games. The team plans to show clips from such movies as The Toxic Avenger and play songs by William Shatner, The Partridge Family and Milli Vanilli. Between innings, there will be such fan contests as "Bald Guys Race for the Toupee" and "Dunking for Onions." Finally, player batting averages will be presented instead as fail averages -- a player hitting .200, for instance, will be shown with a .800 fail average.

      A friend of mine has a PhD in ministry from Dallas Theological Seminary.  He graduated first in his class.  I haven't asked permission of him to share this, so I won't mention his name, but he said something that has been making me think.  He was talking about faith and said:  "The more educated you get about faith, the less you do with it.  The more you learn, the more you want to learn, and you spend more time learning and impressing others with what you've learned instead of showing Jesus to real people.  I wish I had spent eight years pursuing ministry instead of spending eight years in school, learning things that I'll never use outside the church walls."  He then said "The more you see people talk about their educational accomplishments, the more you know that they're nor getting dirty in ministry.  My educatiuon allows me to hide behind my pulpit, encouraging believers - and I should be on the streets where Jesus would be."  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Sam

      Today, I have to drive to Guitars Center to purchase a sound system for another church we've started on Lopez Island.  It reminds me that God has called my chruch to a vision.  God has blessed us greatly.  In the last four years, we've gone from not existing at all to having more than 3,000 people worshipping in eight locations, and there's two more coming soon.  I love my job.

      A friend from my church took me out on his boat today on Lake Samish.  It was beautiful.  We docked the boat and were doing a few things to the ski ropes, when another ski boat pulls up alongside to dock.  The driver was Ryan Stiles, of "Who's Line is it Anyway" and "The Drew Carey Show".  He has his main home on Lake Samish.  He's a very, very cool guy.  Down to earth, and just as funny as when you see him on TV.  His humor was suprisingly clean, and he made small talk for about 15 minutes.

      I love pastoring my church, but I'm also in a role as a worship pastor.  I love being on our worship staff.  It's past midnight, and I've been sitting in our church's production studio for the past seven hours, engineering the drum/percussion mix for our latest worship album.  It's really fun to sit in front of 70-something channels of recording possibility!  We're using Pro Tools 6 though a Digidesign 16 channel digital and a vintage Sun 24 channel mixer.  A dual G4 configuration powers all of this stuff, and I'm in creative nirvana sitting behind the mixing desk.  Later this week, it's my turn in the isolation booth, recording guitar stuff.  I love my job.  Sam

      Last night as I was playing in worship, I thought about the redemptive power of Christ.  I thought about how attractive the Church can be when we as a body reach out to our community with the acceptance that Jesus offers.  Last night, my worship team consisted of a worship leader who is coming out of a nasty divorce.  Her ilfe is in shambles, but she loves the Lord, and she is a great worship leader.  The drummer is young, and is pretty angry with the world for the hand that life has dealt him.  He doesn't really have any friends to speak of, but he loves getting to come to church and play with all he's got.  My acoustic guitar player is homeless, and before church started, I had to go get my bass player out of Skagit County Jail.  He's been a Christian for all of 10 days, and he's still paying for his past.   We were ending our service, and we came to the chorus that says,  "Lord who am I compared to your glory  Lord who am I compared to your majesty  I am Your beloved Your creation And You love me as I am You have called my chosen for Your kingdom Unashamed to call me Your own I am Your beloved"  I looked around at my team and saw that almost everyone was crying.  I've been a Christian all my life.  They haven't.  They are just now experiencing what it is to know the grace, mercy, and acceptance of Christ.  Each person on that team except for me has come to know the Lord through our church in the last six months.  This is still very, very fresh for them.  I knew that we weren't going to be able to sing for a while because of the emotions going on on stage, so I switched to the boost channel on my amp, dug into my Les Paul, and played the most heartfelt solo of life.  Sometimes God allows us to really see Him in others, not through the good works that we do, but in our brokenness being made well.

      Last night, we shared communion together at church.  It was a sweet time.  We had an Open Mic time for sharing.  The first one to share was Butch.  Butch is a legitimate biker.  He's ridden his Harley from Sedro-Woolley, WA. to Bangor, Maine, and then to Miami, Florida, then to the Panama Canal, then to San Diego, CA, and then back to Sedro-Woolley, ALL IN ONE TRIP.  Anyway, he's as rough as they come, and he's been coming to our church for three weeks.  Here's what he shared, and I quote him word-for-word so that you get the effect of what he said.  "Frankly, I've never given a damn about other people, and I've never had anyone give a shit about me.  But when I come here, I feel like you guys actually want to know who I am underneath the biker shit.  I think I need Jesus.  I think I need this church.  (as his tears begin to flow) I need you people to....  to.... love me. "  A few people were shocked at his colorful language, but everyone understood that he's searching for the Lord.  It was a perfect lead-in to communion.

      I'm in the procress of recording my first worship album.  The project is called "simple worship" (at least until my graphic artist changes it), and it should be available for purchase in September.  This is a big step for me, something that has taken me more than seven years to prepare my heart for.  I recorded an album in college that I threw away, and I destroyed the masters - it was more about me than God.    But now, I think it's time.  I'd love to know your thoughts.

      Last night, I went to Guitar Center to pick up some audio equipment for my church, and I was frustrated to find out that the products that they said that they would have waiting for me weren't there.  This was the third time I had driven the 42 miles (one way) to the store, and the third time that they had dissapointed me.  I was joking with the owner of the store that they should comp me with a free guitar.    They did.  It's a cheapie, but I got a $300 guitar for free plus a case.  I am now adding a  urlLink Squire Stratocaster  to the guitar stable.  Sometimes life isn't all that bad.

      Like most of you, I'm an artist.  I spend the majority of my time with other artists.  The problem with this is that sometimes, my art (music) is geared for the audience of artists that are in my circle.    As artists within the Church, our job is to make sure that we are spending time crafting art that can be appreciated by the masses, not just other artists.  Another acousitc player can really appreciate what I do in alternate tunings, but the average Joe just wants something he can sing along with on the way to work.  I hope you take a second, and try your best to take an objective look at your art (I know, I know, it never works) and make sure that you're devoting some of the time on whatever creative canvas you use to produce art for non-artists.  This really has me thinking lately.  Should abandon growth in my artform?  Absoultely not.  Should I balance my aritistic productivity so that I am appealing to more than one audience?  I think my calling as a believer mandates that I do.

      No one opened the doors to the guitar world for me as much as Michael Hedges.  I had been messing around with the guitar for about two years, but hadn't made a true effort to  play  the thing.  One day, a friend of mine put in a Michael Hedges album, and suddenly the acoustic guitar became the coolest thing on the planet.  Alternate tunings became my passion on the instrument.    Anyway, I read a great quote from him this week in old article.  For all of you acoustic players, here's some thoughts from one of the masters...  "When I’m writing a piece, I write it entirely for me. When I play it, I play it entirely for the audience and the audience gives it back to me tenfold. I think you always have to keep that live connection going because that’s what music is all about—it’s communication between human beings. Performing is more of a sensual experience—composing is more of a spiritual one. Music goes from human soul to human soul. My approach to music and my approach to life are the same thing. I’m not quite sure what that is, but I’m always thinking about the way I’m living while I’m playing guitar, and I’m always thinking about the way I’m playing the guitar when I’m living. Why think about guitar while you’re playing guitar? Why not think about life? You don’t want to tell people how you’re playing the guitar. You want to tell people how you live. That’s the purpose of playing guitar, from my perspective.”

He's a brilliant thinker, probably one of the most brilliant people I've ever met.    It's been a good few days, and I'm pretty energized to get back to work when I get home.

      I just sent my Taylor 410-ltd off to El Cajon, CA for the guys at Taylor to do a retrofit for the new  urlLink Expression System  that Robert Neve designed.  Instead of using microphones and transducer pickups, it uses magnetized disks to "feel" the body of the guitar vibrate, thus giving the listener a more accurate audio portrayal of what the guitar sounds like.  I love my current LR Baggs system in my 814-ltd, it'll be interesting to see how the two stack up once I get my guitar back from the shop.

      Last week, I got to see a concert that was hands down the best live performance that I've ever seen.  These guys aren't spectacular showmen, but they are four of the best steel-string acoustic players in the world.  Beppe Gambetta, Don Ross, Tony McManus, and Dan Crary all shared a small stage at the Tractor Tavern in Seattle.  They call the show  urlLink Men of Steel , and if this tour ever come anywhere within a day's drive of you, you need to see this show.  Wow.  On a ministry note, we started a new worship center in Burlington, Washington on Sunday.  It was a lot of fun.  I've got a great worship team to play with, and a great group of people to worship with.  I look forward to this being a long-term relationship.  This morning, Shannon and I went to a doctor's appointment to hear Max's heartbeat.  It's amazing to think that I'll have two sons in about 12 weeks.  God has blessed me so much.  Tomorrow, I'm going to  urlLink Lopez Island  to visit the worship volunteers who serve at the Christ the King Church that we've helped start over there.  This is cool for many reasons, since I get to see some people who are doing some amazing things.  I am excited though, because I'll hit the bridge over  urlLink Deception Pass  right around sunrise, and then I'll ride a ferry through some of the most beautiful scenery in America.

      Today at my staff meeting for Christ the King Church, my pastor talked to us about time management.  He told us (quoting an economist, I don't remember the name...)that 20% of our effort produces 80% of our results.  He said that this also meant that 80% of our efforts produced only 20% of our results.  We talked together about how true this is, especially in full-time ministry.    How do you find out what your 20% is?  Start backwards.  Look at what's working in your ministry, then work your way backwards and figure out what you did to make it happen.  What conversations did you have?  What people did you connect with?  What resources did you use or give away?  As you ponder this, keep in mind that effort does not equal time.  It's an amazing little process to go through, and quite humbling.  We can accomplish a lot for the Kingdom in a short amount of time if we leverage the efforts that we put forth.  I'm thinking about this a lot this evening.

      1 Corinthians 13 lists a lot of attributes of love.  One of these attributes is that love rejoices with the truth.  Obviously, there are many ways one can read into this.  Love rejoices with the Truth, the Word.  I had an experience this week that reminded me that love also means rejoicing in the truth of honesty.  We're in a culture, especially (and unforunately) in the church culture.  We don't always say what we're thinking and feeling to someone in the name of peace, the "peace" we experience is not peace at all,  but rather the absence of conflict, and the two are not equal.  If we are to love each other, I mean truly love each other, then we have to start being honest with each other.  We have to give the kind of communication that we want to receive.  This week, I met with two worship leaders from my church, one who had been given organizational authority over the other.  There were many issues that were discussed that were bringing friction into the relationship, but it all boiled down to a lack of honesty, which was based on a lack of trust.  I told these two people the same thing that I want to tell everyone else - honest communication is the only mode of operation we should use in any relationship, especially one that is centered on ministry.  Even in the heat of the moment, if you think you might not be understood, communicate the honest truth to whomever you are speaking to.  When Jesus was walking on the water and Peter came out to Him, Peter fell.  Jesus reached His arm down, and as He pulled Peter our of the water, He asked Peter why he had no faith.  In the heat of the moment, Jesus called Peter on a pretty touchy issue.  He didn't wait until they got back to shore, He didn't have lunch with him the next day to discuss the "teachable moment" that they had shared, He just spoke the honest truth right in the moment.  And so should we.

      I got my Taylor 410-ltd back from the factory shop with the new ES system installed.  I have to say that there are some brilliant people at Taylor, who worked along with audio sciece legend Robert Neve.  This is a cool product.  I do need to say that the jury is still out on this, though.  I'm not sure if I like it or love it yet.  I really love the LR Baggs Dual Source system in my Taylor 814-ltd, but it oculd be that this is just the system that I'm used to.  As I play the new ES, I'll give you some feedback.

      I'm gearing up to head to the Lone Star State for a week and a half to  do some concerts, lead worship, and do some songwriting.  I'll be in Houston mostly, but am working on some dates in Austin, San Antonio, and Abilene.  I'm looking forward to going to Texas.  I grew up there.  I was born and raised in the town of Tomball.  I always like going back, even though Northwest Washington now feels like home. I love going back to Texas because things go at a slower pace.  People are less busy, less stressed.  In Tomball, I can go get a haircut at Joe's Barbershop, where I've had haircuts since the 3rd grade.  I can go eat at Goodson's, a cafe that has been around longer than I have.  I can go to Spring Creek Park and walk through the woods where I used to spend so much time as a kid.  One of my favorite things to do is to go to the Cotton Farming exhibit that is close to my parents home.  There's a house that has been in the same location since the mid 1800's.  I often sit on the porch and imagine the stories that porch would tell if it could talk.  That house has seen a lot of change from it's front porch in its many years.  While I'm in Houston, I'll be sure to stop at  urlLink Pe-Te's Cajun BBQ House , a place that I frequented when I worked in Houston.  This place was one block from my church office, and I loved it.    Anyway, enough for today.  Maybe I'll see in you Texas!

      I've been here two days, and have done two concerts, one in my hometown of Tomball, and one in downtown Houston.  The concert in Tomball was amazing - the audience was great.  It was nice to be home, to see some of the people who I have known for my entire life.  There's something very reassuring about seeing these people.  They really don't care about  my musicianship, they just wanted to see me.  It keeps everything in perspective.  I've got a day off today and will be going to St. Luke's Hospital in Houston, where my sister has just delivered triplet daughters.  It's been a crazy week.  My dad had a pacemaker put it Monday, I landed on Wednesday, and got there just in time to see my new neices.  I'm also going to be doing some songwriting for my next album, so I'd appreciate your prayers as I go through the long process all over again.  I've got a few more concerts to do, then I'll be heading back to Washington.  I miss my wife and son, and I can't wait to see them.

      Well, I'm done with the concerts, and it has been a fun time.  It has been a good experience to be back on stage.  Sometimes it's nice to be back in a performance environment with just my voice and my guitar - it really helps you to make an honest evaluation of who you are and where you're at in a musical sense.  Overall, God blessed me to be able to come down at just the right time to be able to help my family out when they needed an extra set of hands.  One thing is for sure, though, one of the worst lives in the world has got be that of a touring musician.  I haven't seen my wife and son in over a week, and that is incredibly hard.  I'm looking forward to being home tomorrow.

      Yesterday in out CTK Staff Meeting, my pastor, Dave Browning, shared some really great stuff with us.  A lot of the things that he shared are from a book called "Organzing Genius" by Warren Bennis.  We first read 1 Samuel 14:1-23, and then we discussed the following major points.  1. To be an effective church, we need a young man's faith.  2. Historically, great leaders are almost always:    - Under 35 years old    - Have high energy    - Have no past successes to protect    - Have an almost dillusional confidence    - Their lack of experience is an asset    - They tend to have a completely unrealistic view of what can be accomplished.  3. Youth is not a chronological age, but an attitude to have.  4. What robs most churches of success?   - Age as an organization   - Experience (which can be a liability)   - Cynicism   - Success (the past success rarely defines future success)  Something to think about.

      Rick's Just a Bite is a little hole in the wall in downtown Mt. Vernon, Wa.  Formerly a barbershop, Rick's isn't a big place, there is a lunch counter where food is both served and eaten, and there are ten stools awaiting patrons.  Rick's is one of the best places to eat in town.  They have great food, but they have excellent service.  When I walk in the door, Rick looks up from the grill and says "Hey Sam!".  Diana, his wife, usually has a Dr. Pepper on ice waiting for me when I sit down.  I don't need a menu, because I know what's on it, and I usually don't order, because they already know what I want.  Because they only have ten customers to wait on, I never have to ask for a refill or for anything else, because they are able to see what I'm missing and they are quick to act on it.  I honestly think that Rick's is one of the best paces to eat in this whole valley.  The food misght cost a dollar or two more, finding a parking spot might be a chore, but the service that I receive there is second to none.  I am a part of Christ the King Community Church in the Skagit Valley of Washington State.  It's my church, and I love it.  One of our big things is staying small.  We have three main priorities - Worship, Small Groups, and Outreach, and saying small is helping us to accomplish these three things.  We're a multi-location church, which means that we are on big church spread out over 11 locations, with more coming in the near future.  Our main line of thinking on this is that we offer big church resources to people with a small church feel.  Instead of having on big church of thousands of people, we have many small churches with hundreds.  Like Rick's restaurant, we are able to greet people by name and know their likes and dislikes.  When there is a need in their life, we typically know about it and are able to do something to help.  When you walk through the doors of a CTK Worship Center, whether for the first time of the hundredth time, you're treated like family.  Being a part of one of these smaller locations might cost more of you.  You might get asked to serve, and you will be asked to be a part of a small group.  You can't really hide among the crowd, because we don't have any crowds.  However, if you're looking for a place where you can know people and really be known, you should check out a CTK Worship Center in your neighborhood this weekend.   I love this place.

      My wife Shannon is due to deliver our second son any moment now.  Her due date is May 14th, so it could be today, it could be next week, you never know.  Needless to say, I'm only semi-effective when I'm at work, and my brain is always on my family right now.  I'm sure some of you know the feeling.

      Sundays are crazy days for me right now.  My church is one that meets in multiple locations in order to reach more people.  I am the Worship Leader at one of these places, and the Pastor of another one.  On Sundays, I go to the first place in Burlington at setup stage, rehearse with my team, and then I lead worship.  As soon as the pastor gets up to teach, I grab my guitar and drive as fast as I legally can to another location about 5 miles away, where I play drums during worship, then I teach.  It makes for a long day, but it's rewarding at the same time.  One thing I've learned in the process of doing this is the importance of planning and the simple execution of those plans. I could go on and on, but you can probably make some application of your own on this.  I'll write more this week.

      Thursday night, I suffered what the doctor calls "Severe Acoustical Trauma" in my left ear.  We use Shure In-Ear Monitors at my church, and during rehearsal, I had a high-frequency, high-decibal noise come through the left side, and it felt like getting punched in the ear.  My doctor says that I have lost a little mroe that 60% of my hearing capcity in my left hear, damage that is most likely permanent.  Other than my wife being very annoyed at having to often repeat herself, we're doing fine with it.    I'll keep you updated on it.

      Max Davis Middlebrook was born at 1:32am on Thursday, May 14th.  He was 8lbs. 3oz, and 20 1/2 inches long.  He's a pretty cool kid.  Right now, he's doing what all newborns do, which is eat and sleep, then eat and sleep.    Levi, our older son, is in love with little Max.  He gives him lots of hugs and kisses.  We'll see if he still wants to do that in a few years...

      Across the street from my home is a pasture with about 40 head of cattle in it. Last night, two wolves came meandering down our street, and were very close to the pasture.  The cows reacted in the most amazing way.  One cow let out a huge yelping sound, and all of the cattle came running (literally running) from all over the pasture.  The huddled up with the calves in the center, and they all faced out, and began to make a lot of noise with their hooves and with their yelping. It was an amazing sight to see.  The wolves became disinterested, and then came into my yard.  I walked out of door yelling and waving my arms trying to scare them away, and it worked.  It turns out that these animals were pets of a man down the street.  It was an amazing, awkward, and unusual scene.

      Seven years ago today, I stepped off of a plane from Houston to Seattle to be greeted by Wade Hodges at Sea-Tac Airport in the middle of the night.  Wade and I had gotten to know each other at Abilene Christian University.  He was a graduate student and an assistant teacher in one on my freshman classes.  Through that and pickup basketball, I got to know Wade a little bit, and he later invited me to come intern under him at Sterling Drive Church in Bellingham, WA.  Once I stepped off of that plane, my life was different.  The next morning, Wade showed me around Whatcom County - Whatcom Falls, Chuckanut Drive, Fairhaven, Boulevard Park, Mount Baker from a distance, etc...  Later that day, I even had my first mocha.  It struck me as funny all that has happened in the last seven years.  When I stepped off of that plane, Wade was just starting ministry at this church.  He was learning to master the craft of storytelling to communicate the gospel.  He and his wife had been married for a year or so, and were enjoying life.  I was very young and quite single.  I knew about three chords on the guitar, and I put every song I could think of together with those three chords.  I thought about how Wade and I have both moved on to other ministries where God is allowing us to maximize our gifts and reach more people.  I thought about how we both now have mortgages and two sons a peice.  I thought about how much life has changed since then, and for the better.  God used Wade to pull my head of a very enthnocentric, coastal Texas worldview, and allow me to see things in a whole new way.  I'm blessed to be where I am because of moments like the one I had seven years ago.

      (I didn't write this. It comes from an Acoustic Journal I subscribe to.  The author was never mentioned.  I have gone to this method completely, when I use standard tuning, you should check it out.)  Many guitarists are frustrated because of their attempts to tune the guitar to pure chords. These particular players have very sensitive ears that prefer pure intervals and reject the mandatory equal temperament. They tune their guitar beautifully pure on one chord only to discover that the next chord form is unacceptable. In too many instances they assume that there must be a flaw in the workmanship on the fingerboard. Their problem is not in the construction of the guitar. It is one of pure tuning verses equal temperament.   You must accept this compromise because the guitar is an instrument of fixed pitch and the strings must be tuned to tempered intervals, not pure. Equal temperament is the name given to a system of dividing the chromatic scale into 12 equal half steps. Guitarists who have been trying to tune to one or another pure chord form must learn to understand and accept equal temperament. (They might be interested to know that to approximate pure chords on all forms would require about three dozen frets within the octave.) The system of equal temperament reduces the number to twelve, thereby making manageable all instruments of fixed pitch.   Here is what all of this means to the guitarist: You must not, at any time, use harmonic tones at the 7th fret as a point of reference (skilled piano tuners could use them because they know how many beats to introduce between 4th and 5th). Harmonic tones at the 7th fret are pure 5ths, while in equal temperament each 5th must be lowered slightly. To tune by harmonics at the 7th fret (as occasionally ill-advised) will make the guitar sound entirely unacceptable on some chord forms.   On the other hand, all harmonics at the 12th and 5th frets, being one and two octaves above the open strings, are immediately useful as explained below. All octaves and unisons are pure on all instruments of fixed pitch. Therefore, you may use harmonics at 12th and 5th as reference tones in the following tuning instructions.   Actually this discussion and the following suggestions are for those players who have been tuning to pure intervals. When the steps have been followed correctly the guitar will be as perfectly tuned as it could be in the hands of a professional. Nevertheless, when you have finished, your sensitive ear may notice that on each major chord form there is always one tone slightly high. If you start adjusting a particular string on a certain chord form, you only compound the problem because then the next chord form will be completely objectionable. Tune the guitar as instructed below and let it stand. How to help your ear accept equal temperament: It is easier to face a problem if we are prepared in advance and expect it. If you are one of those persons who is sensitive to pure intervals, here is what you are going to notice on an absolutely perfectly tuned guitar in equal temperament: Play an open E major chord. Listen to G# on the third string and you most likely will want to lower it very slightly. Don't do i t. Ignore it. Enjoy the overall beauty and resonance of chord just as does the pianist.   That troublesome second string: Play an open position A major chord. Listen to the C# on the second string and you may want to lower it slightly. Play a first position C chord and listen to the E on the first string and fourth string at 2. These tones are slightly higher than your ear would like.   Now play an open position G chord. Listen to B on the second string. Yes, it would sound a little better if lowered ever so slightly. Why not try it? Slack off the second string a couple of vibrations and notice what beautiful G chord results. Now play the C chord and with that lowered second string, and you are going to dislike the rough C and E a lot more than before. Take the open B, second string back up to equal temperament so that it will be equally acceptable on all forms. Learn to expect and accept the slight sharpness of the major third in each chord (and oppositely, the flatness of the minor third in each minor chord). Train your ear to accept tempered intervals and you will be much happier with your guitar.   PROCEDURE:   Tuning the 1st and 6th strings: The E, open 1st string, must be in pure unison with the harmonic of the E, 6th string at the fifth fret. When these two strings have been properly tuned with each other, continue as follows. Tuning the 4th string: Play a harmonic on the (in tune) 6th string at twelve, and as this harmonic sounds, adjust the 4th string until the tone E on the second fret is in pure unison. Now you have the E, open 1st string, 1st on the 4th string at two, and E, open 6th string tuned pure (permissible because they are octaves).   Tuning the 2nd string: Play a harmonic on the (in tune) 4th string at twelve. As this sounds, adjust the 2nd string until D at the third fret is in pure unison. As you have used two fretted tones for references and as the frets are positioned for tempered intervals, you now have the open 1st, 2nd 4th and 6th strings in tempered tuning.   Tuning the 3rd string: As it is easier to adjust a string while listening to a continuous reference tone, you may first try the following: Play a harmonic on the (in tune) 4th string at twelve and as this sounds, adjust the 3rd string until D at the 7th fret is in pure unison.   Double check: Now make this check to see if you have been accurate or if the instrument plays tune when fretted at seven. Play a harmonic on the (now tuned) G string at twelve, and as this tone sounds, play G on the 1st string at three. The two tones should be in pure unison. If they are not, either you are at fault or the instrument doesn't fret tune at seven. Go back to the beginning and carefully check each step up to this point. If the tones are still faulty, then readjust the 3rd string until the harmonic at twelve is in unison with the 1st at three. Do not tamper with the 1st and 4th strings because it is the 3rd string you are trying to bring in tune. When you have the 1st, 6th, 4th, 2nd and 3rd strings in tune, in that order, continue with the remaining 5th string.   Tuning the 5th string: Play the tone A on the (in tune) 3rd string, at the second fret. Listen to this pitch carefully and now adjust the 5th string until the harmonic at twelve is in pure unison. When the foregoing steps are followed correctly, the strings will be tuned perfectly to equal temperament. No further tuning adjustments are permissible.

      Well, our day of sailing was incredible. We anchored in a reef-rich cove on  urlLink Lummi Island , which was amazing.  A full day of sun, mountains, islands, water, and some of my most favorite people - my church staff.  Back to reality, though.  1. When I turned on my cell this morning, I has 29 voice-mails waiting for me. 2. One of my worship musicians becomes homeless today, and his wife is in the hospital. 3. A married couple in the church I pastor is coming by today to try to save their marriage. 4. A close friend and church leader called to remind me to pray that God would heal him from cancer.  Ministry is hard, but I wouldn't want to be doing anything else.

      I am going to write a series of these posts, and I'm hoping that we can dialogue on these.  Here is something I've been wrestling with for a long time. Have you ever walked off of the stage (or from behind the mic) after a worship service only to have someone come up to you and say "Hey, they was great worship today."  For those of you who are in some sort of staff role at your church, how do you handle these comments in a staff situation?  I'm wrestling with my own concept of corporate worship. I'm trying to stop myself from measuring it, and trying to simply enjoy it.  I'm hoping that the days are gone when I play and sing and lead, hoping that I think that God used me in a big way because many people were in tears, or on their knees, or were raising their hands, or were worshipping in some other demonstrative way.  I'm hoping to get back to the root of it all, trusting that God is sovereign, and that though He enjoys all of my efforts, Him being Himself is enough to draw people to worship.

      The  urlLink church  that I pastor recently hosted an “Absolutely Free” car wash at the Food Pavilion parking lot as a way to show the love of Christ to our community.  No donations were accepted, but instead, free bottles of water and soda were given away along with free balloons for kids.    As we were washing cars, a man pulled up in a truck asking what cause we were raising money for.  He was shocked when we told him that we weren’t taking donations, that we were a church just trying to bless our community with a free car wash.  With a bewildered look, he pulled his truck in to be washed.  After his truck was washed, he pulled me aside and asked “Okay, what’s the deal here?  What is this really for?”  I told him that this was a way for us to example the story of the gospel, that God offers forgiveness for free through the death of Jesus Christ.  I told him that for free, God can cleanse a life forever.  He then said “What do you mean salvation is free?  I’ve never heard that before!  Where are you getting that from?”  I told him that we got it from the Bible, and I explained to him that the New Testament makes it clear that salvation is a free gift of God, something that can’t be earned or achieved.  He responded by saying “You guys teach that at your church?”  I said “Absolutely.”  With a thoughtful look, he thanked me for the car wash, and drove away.  Ten minutes later, he was back in another car.  He jumped out and ran straight to me saying “I’m not trying to take advantage of you here, I’ve got a good reason.”  He told me that his wife was agnostic, and that she did not believe that he had his truck washed for free by a church group.  Her words were, “There’s nothing free at a church!”  To prove her point, she had her husband empty his pockets so that he had no money or checks.  She then emptied the car of any dollar bills or loose change so that he had no way to pay for a car wash.  When he told me this story, I told the work crew that was with me “Hey gang, let’s make sure this one gets really clean.”  And we did.  After his wife’s car was washed, he pulled me aside and was asking about our worship services.  I told him when and where we met, and he said that we would like to come in two weeks.  He then said “It’s going to be weird.”   “What’s going to be weird?”  “I haven’t worn a suit in a long time!”  “Neither have I!”, I said, laughing.  “You mean to tell me that I can come to your church wearing shorts or jeans and a t-shirt, and you’re going to tell me that salvation is free?”  “You bet.”  “The church I grew up in taught me that you had to wear your best clothes, and that you had to earn your salvation .... and that it was nearly impossible.”  “Then you went to wrong church, my friend.”  He grabbed a free can of Pepsi for his wife, and drove away with his head shaking in disbelief.  I would have loved to see the conversation that took place when he got home.  Around my church, we call these the small victories.

      One of the big parts of my ministry is mentoring worship leaders.  I was meeting with a worship leader who I've been working with, and I wanted to teach him about the active relationship between the worship leader and the Holy Spirit during times of corporate worship.  What I came up with worked well, so please, feel free to rip this off and use it.  I had him take a broom, and balance it in his open hand, with the handle end in his hand. The heavier, bristled end was in the air, and I had him balance it for as long as he could.  After it fell, I told him to him to try it again, and this time, to walk fast around the room while he balanced the broom in his hand.  On the third try, I had him balance the broom, walk quickly, and also tell me about his favorite school teacher, which took a lot of effort and thinking.  When he was done, we sat down, and here were the parallels that I pointed out.  1. When you balance the broom in your hands, your hand must go wherever the top of the broom leads it to go to keep it in the air.  If you try to move your hand without following the top of the broom, it will fall.  The same is true of an effective worship leader.  He or she must be reacting to the promptings of the Holy Spirit to keep the worship service going in a Godward direction.  If the Leader moves in a direction that isn't in step with the Spirit, it can fall apart very quickly.   2. To keep the broom in the air, you have to keep your eyes on the top end.  Again, illustrating the need of keeping our focus on the Spirit.   3. The more you cup your hand around the bottom of the broom, the harder it is to keep it stable.  We as worship leaders have to be holding our worship services with loose hands. We can't grab on to any one facet of them to try to maintain or control, we can only hold them with open hands and allow the Spirit to do it's work.

      Here’s the deal… Many of us spend too much time associating worship with music..  God designed us to worship Him with our whole lives, and there are actually spiritual habits that we can build into our lives that help us worship God more deeply? Here are ten habits than will build worship into your life on a daily basis.  1.  Worship through prayer . We often miss this important component of our prayer life. Think about the issues you usually pray about. How much of your prayer life is about you and how much of it is about God? Without a doubt God wants us to be able to share everything that is going on in our life. But he also wants us to get to know Him better. When we affirm who God is through our prayers, we put our prayer life in proper perspective. That’s exactly how Jesus taught us to pray. Look at the Lord’s Prayer in the Gospel of Mathew (6: 9-13); Jesus starts the prayer off by saying “Our Father who is in Heaven, May Your name be honored.” (NLT) Jesus teaches us an important lesson with this prayer. Prayer starts with God.  Consider including in your prayers a time of focused attention on who God is.  2.  Get in a regular habit of reading the Bible . The Bible says that we worship God in “spirit and in truth.” How can we ever worship God without a clear understanding of who He is? The truth about God is essential to worship. Pay special attention to the book of Psalms. No book in the Bible spends as much time carefully describing who God is.  3.  Obey God . Rick Warren mentions in The Purpose Driven Life that we worship God when we obey Him. We all need to build the habit of obedience into our lives. Take practical steps to see that this is a part of your life. Whenever you sense God is speaking to you, make it a regular practice to respond immediately. Don’t let procrastination weigh you down. If you can’t do it immediately, write down whatever God has been putting on your heart, so that you can do it SOON!  4.  Tithe . If you want to know what in your life you worship, look at your checkbook register. The Bible teaches us this important lesson: “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Mathew 6:21 NIV) God wants us to surrender our entire being to Him. One way to show that is by making Him Lord of our pocketbook. If you are already a committed tither, consider raising the percentage you are willing to give.  5.  Build deep relationships .  The Bible teaches that God designed us to live in community with other Christians. We bring God pleasure by getting to know others and being known by them.  The primary way we do this is through small groups.  6.  Share your faith . John Piper made many of us re-look at why we share our faith when he wrote a few years ago: “Missions exists because worship doesn’t.” God wants every person on the planet to worship him, not because He is an egomaniac who needs our praise, but because worship is how we are designed by God. He wants the best for us.  Take time this week to share your spiritual journey with someone else. Tell them how you came to faith in Christ. Don’t worry about their response. Relax in the knowledge that you are playing a part in expanding God’s world-wide worship.  7.  Serve others . Jesus tells us that “when you did it to the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did to me!” (Matt. 25:40 NLT) When we serve one another, Jesus tells us we are really serving Him. If you don’t think you have any gifts that are useful to serve, you are wrong. God made you with talents and gifts that He specifically gave you to serve others.  8.  Build into your life the attitude of thankfulness . This requires looking at the world through a different set of eyes. When we look through the lens of thankfulness, we see our lives – and everything in it – as all gifts from God. Develop your own spiritual exercise each morning that demonstrates that you are putting on your lens of thankfulness. Then begin to thank God for all of the good things in your life.  9.  Begin turning over to God areas of your life that you have never committed to Him . This is the heart of worship – surrender. God won’t settle for 90 percent of your life; He wants all of it. You might have been a follower of Jesus for years, but you still have areas of your life that you are holding back from Him. What are those areas? Only you know that. Two good places to look are your checkbook and your planner. Look at the areas of your life where you spend the most money and the most time. Do they honor God?  10.   Live life on purpose . God has a reason for your existence. In fact, He has five: fellowship, discipleship, ministry, evangelism and worship. You please God when you live in step with His purposes. God doesn’t want you to waste your life.  Worship isn’t simply one area of your life; it is your life. Start right this moment by surrendering your life to God. Then spend the rest of your life learning to worship Him more fully.

      Most of you know that I planted a church on January 4, 2003.&nbsp; This weekend, I will have absolutely nothing to do.&nbsp; There is a pastor who ahs come on full-time from within the church, and a worship director who facilitates our teams will be leading worship.  It's a pretty sweet feeling, watching this church come into it's own.  &nbsp;

      19 months ago, Shannon and I were expecting our first child.  Now we have two boys, Levi and Max.  Here's what I've learned...    1. There is no stickier substance in existence than a wet Rice Krispie.    2. Syrup makes a great hair styling product.    3. When little boys have absolutely nothing to cry about, they will create something to cry about.    4. There is nothing quite as comical and sad as watching your 18-month-old-son routinely walk up behind other toddlers, and deliver a left hook to their jaw while he laughs.    5.  Nothing makes your chest want to explode quite like seeing both of your boys smile for the first time on purpose.    6. Teaching your 18-month-old that burping is funny is very counterproductive.

      I have just recovered from seeing the marginally good "I, Robot" movie.  Amazing effects, some cool digital action sequences, but how many times, can there be a futuristic Will Smith movie that centers itself on the crucial moment when Will gets angry and slowly says "Heeellll, no!"  It's getting really old (Men in Black, Independance Day, Men in Black II).    Moving on, there are a three movies that I am really excited to see. Well, to be honest, there's one that I'm really excited about, and two that have previews that have me very interested.    The one I'm really excited about opens Friday,  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . I really liked the first one, because I thought that Matt Damon was an excellent choice for the role. He doesn't look like an action hero, but he was believable in the "I'm-not-buff-just-very-well-trained" role, and I am excited to see the sequel.    The second movie I want to see is called  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate .  This one stars Denzel Washington, and well, that alone makes me want to see it.    The thrid movie is called  urlLink Cellular , which I want to see because it lookd to be a very original twist on the classic man-saves-woman twist.    For different events such as weddings, I receive gift cards from people who want to say thanks., Anticipating this summer movie season, my wife and I have saved gift cards to Loews Cinema, and gift cards to local restaurants. We will be able to see all three movies for free, including snacks, plus have a nice dinner out. It'll make for a fun few weeks.

      Last night, I purchased a high-capacity SD Card for my  urlLink Ipaq .  It's great, because I have turned my full-functioning PDA into a iPod type player.   I spent most of the night uploading music to it from my cd collection.  I now have 1,000 songs with me wherver I go, all categorized and playlisted the way I would like them.  This morning, I've been listening to Phil Keaggy, John Mayer, Victor Wooten, and some old Loe Kottke.

      ADD strikes again, and so here's where my brain has gone for the last ten minutes...  1. Why don't they invent edible birthday cake candles?&nbsp; You'd never have to worry about getting the waxy stuff on your cake, you could just eat the whole thing.&nbsp; I've been thinking about this for over a year, and I want to see it happen.  2. Why isn't there a computer/microwave out there?&nbsp; For a single person, this flat ssreen computer would also be the door for the microwave.&nbsp; It saves space, and it's handy.  Okay, I'll shut up now.

      A few days ago, I met with "Bob" (not his real name) to talk about life.&nbsp; About a year ago, I hosted an evening at my church for anyone in the area who plays  urlLink Taylor Guitars .&nbsp; I figured it would be a great way for me to get to talk to other guitar geeks like myself, but more than that, to get the chance to know some people who I otherwise wouldn't have any contact with.  "Bob" has two Taylors, and came to the event.&nbsp; We talked for a while, and he made it very clear that he was NOT into the church thing.&nbsp; He said that he found church to be fro people who are weak-minded and can't figure life out on their own.  For the past year, "Bob" and I have been meeting routinely.&nbsp; We enjoy a cold Guiness together, play guitars, and talk about life.&nbsp; He has been asking a million questions about forgiveness.&nbsp; He can't seem to wrap his mind around the idea of salvation being a gift of God that isn't produced by any of our actions.&nbsp; I have told him many times that our actions are representative of our hearts, and that it is our hearts that God is really after.&nbsp; I think he's starting to get it.  "Bob" is learning for the first time that God grace is enough.&nbsp; It's an amazing process for me to watch.&nbsp; It keeps me from being jaded by all of the stuff that people put into church.&nbsp; Those of us who are Christians for a long time tend to forget the wonder and the awe of the grace of God.&nbsp; It starts to affect us in an emotional way less and less, until we  really  need it.&nbsp; We tend to think of grace in an increasingly cerebral fashion, and when we seek forgiveness, it affects our hearts all over agin.  My hope and prayer for us Christians is that we would be envious of "Bob" as he stares into the redemptive face of God with eyes full of wonder and excitement.&nbsp;   God's grace is enough.

      I wanted to write simply to say thanks for taking the time to read this stuff that I write.&nbsp; A lot of you are worship leaders who I have mentored, or your church uses some of the songs I've written for worship.&nbsp; Some of you know me personally, and just want to stay in touch.&nbsp; Your comments to me are encouraging and very much appreciated.   Today, a very dear person to me said that she found some of the stuff on this site "cleansing".&nbsp; Wow.   I get a lot out of writing on this site.&nbsp; It's exactly what I advertise, "My brain.&nbsp; On your screen."&nbsp; There are going to be moments when I write about things that completely irrelevant and pretty much dumb, and occasionally, I might come up with something helpful.&nbsp; I use this site as primary source of brainstorming for ministry ideas and articles, and your feedback is very useful to me.   I could ramble on for a while, but I just wanhted to say thanks for participating in this online discussion.   &nbsp;

      I'm at a computer store cruising the latest laptops. I'm pretty much sold on the  urlLink Sony Vaio S Series VGN-S150 .&nbsp; It's pretty awesome.  &nbsp;

      Dear Readers,  For the first time ever, I deleted a comment a few moments ago under a post called "Laying it Down". The person who posted had some challenges about what my church does in worship, challenges that this person assumed were Biblical.  I welcome these discussions, but if you choose to post in that vein of conversation, please tell us your name. Any futher anonymous posts that are challanges or of any negative nature will be immediately deleted by me.  If the person who originally posted would like to re-post with their name, I will welcome you to this site.  Blessings, Sam Middlebrook

      Today, I've been listening to as much music as I possibly can. I've had headphones on for almost 13 hours straight, including at lunch (I was by myself).  I'm trying to recapture the love for music. I've discoverd that I spend so much time creating music that I don't take a lot of time to enjoy the music of others. It dawned on me that I was a little out of touch with current rock and pop music when my intern showed me a few cd's that he had recently bought, and I did not recognize any of the names or bands.  Do you ever feel this way? When I got bored with what I was listening to or playing, I would just write something new or try to recreate my playing style.  I think one of the best ways to break out of a creative rut it stop trying to create and enjoy what other's creativity has already produced.  I'll keep you updated.

      This last weekend, I led worship with a killer 1983 Fender Strat, with point-to-point handwired custom pickup setup through my Boss GT-6 Processor and vintage Ampeg tube amp.  I discovered (yet again) that I shouldn't be playing electric in worship.  The entire time we were worshipping, my brain was thinking about five things:   1. Guitar Tone

      Last week, I told you that I was listening to music constantly. I listened to a ton of acoustic artists like Don Ross, Chris Proctor, Randy Smith, and Tony McNanus. Here's what came out of it.  - I learned two new tunings for acoustic guitar.  (low to high, DAEADG and EBAEBE) - I wrote three new instrumental peices. - I wrote four new worship songs, two if which are already being used. - I recorded twoolder song that have now been "re-vamped".  If you're ever in a rut musically, I highly suggest doing what I did. It took me back to some music that I love, and re-inspired me to pick up my guitar with fresh hands and ears. It's amazing how something you're so passionate about can become so mundane without any fresh inspiration.    It's a great metaphor for our worship lives.   Give it some thought.
