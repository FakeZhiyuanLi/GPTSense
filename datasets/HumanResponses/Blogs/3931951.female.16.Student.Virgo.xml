        Hey all.&nbsp; I am so wired right now, but in a lot of pain.&nbsp; I went to my friend's birthday party last night and got really wasted.&nbsp; We went and played on the bales (The joys of living in a farming community in rural Saskatchewan) and we were all jumping off of them onto other bales.&nbsp; Well, when I went to jump onto another bale, I fell down the entire stack of bales and landed right on my back.&nbsp; Oh my god, did that ever hurt.&nbsp; Ry was looking for me and here I ended up on the exact opposite side of the bales as him and had to walk through a great big puddle so deep my pants were drenched past my knees just to get back to the party.&nbsp; It sucked, but it was fun and I was so drunk that ten minutes later I couldn't feel anything anyways.&nbsp; I didn't get home until 4:30 in the morning.&nbsp; My mom almost shit a brick.&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; I went to my exboyfriend's house tonight and played X Box with O (My ex).&nbsp; We broke up on the first of July, and after only 24 days we're awesome friends.&nbsp; We party together and hang out a lot.&nbsp; I still love him a lot but I don't have the urge to go out with him again.&nbsp; The relationship lasted for almost 3 years, so I'm pretty much ready to be single again.&nbsp; Especially since next year I graduate and will be off to University where boyfriends will be such a distraction.&nbsp; Still love him though, and I really hope we'll be friends for a long time.&nbsp; He's a really great guy.&nbsp; And he's a really great fuck too.&nbsp; That's a plus.&nbsp; At least I still get to do that with him without having any emotional attachment and all that clinical/mental bullshit.&nbsp; Anyways, I should go to sleep.&nbsp; I have to work all day tomorrow... 10:30 am until 9:00 pm.&nbsp; wow!&nbsp; G'nite all.     &nbsp;    luv, nic&nbsp; xoxo

         Howdy.       My weekend has been terrific. It started early, since my best friend's birthday was on Thursday. She had a party at Aimee's (my other best friend) house and we all got really hammered. Tiff (my best friend) and I hung out pretty much the entire night, and we had a great time doing it. It was fun. Lots and lots of fun.       Friday night was a dead night here in town. There weren't any parties unless you were willing to drive an hour out of town just to get to one. Instead, Tiff and I played Monopoly at her brother's place and she whipped my ass! It sucked losing, but it was great fun anyways.       Saturday (yesterday) there was a great big pit/bush party. I went out there with Tiff and Aimee. Tiff was the DD for the night, so Aimee and I got drunk. I met a guy there named Carter. He's from somewhere in British Columbia, but he was down here for some family reunion. He came to the party with a couple of his cousins, whom I practically grew up with when I used to live out on a farm. It was cool. And he's a great kisser. He asked me for my phone number, and I gave it to him, not actually expecting him to phone me, but, much to my surprise, I got a phone call this afternoon.       My God, the phone in this house was practically off the hook all day today. I was constantly getting phone calls from all of my friends. It was unbelievably crazy. My friend Ashton phoned me to see if I would go visit a friend with her. He used to live here and is back in town for a little while visiting his grandpa and aunt. I tell you though, I had the most boring time out there this afternoon. I was ready to gouge my eyes out for the least amount of amusement.      I got the day off from work at the clothing store, but I was supposed to work at the ice cream shop for the evening shift, but I got another girl to cover so I'd have one full day off of work. I don't have many of those, working three summer jobs and dealing with my alcoholic behavior (Just kidding!). No, I'm not an alcoholic. Borderline, perhaps, but not full blown.      I got home from visiting that old friend, was home long enough to watch two episodes of What I Like About You, and then I left again. I drove around for a little while, then ended up at O's place. I hung out with him tonight, and we rented a movie. Scary Movie 3. I've seen a couple times already, but Scary Movie movies are so unbelievably great; I could never get sick of any of them. When O and I went to the store to pick up the video, we ran into Carter and his cousins. Talk about awkward. It felt way weird, but kind of cool too. I burst out laughing and they all looked at me weird. Whatever though. I don't care.      Tomorrow, O and I are going to the lake. That is, if the weather is nice. We were supposed to go today, but the weather was totally shitty. Wasn't hot enough, is what O says. Big baby. Too picky. Carter and his cousins are supposed to be going out there too tomorrow. Maybe we'll run into them again and it'll be one majorly disturbing run-in. I can't wait for the awkward silence that awaits us.      Whatever happens, happen. Can't really do anything about it, now can I? But it does feel weird though. I still really like O, but there are so many other guys that, even though I'm not looking for a boyfriend right now, I would enjoy spending time with and possibly dating. Nothing serious. But... Fuck it. I don't know what I'm talking about. But, good news is... This guy named Josh, who is really cute and really cool, likes me and is coming to visit his grandma in a couple weeks. Yay. I hope we hang out.      Jesus Christ bananas! I sound like some love sick, boy crazy girl in the seventh grade. Fuck me Freddy! (I watched Dreamcatcher the other night, hence the new "slang." I definitely recommend watching that movie. Fucking great!) I'm really not a love sick, boy crazy girl in the seventh grade. I'm a grounded, mature teenager in the twelfth grade. I am smart and, depending on the activity, talented. I am not the kind of person to drop everthing for love. I will not, can not, and do not make my life revolve around love and sex. I am a rational person. I have my priorities straight. I know what I want out of life... What the fuck. Who am I trying to convince here; You? Or myself?      Anyways. I should run. Don't know why. I think maybe I'm just done writing stuff. G'nite all.      luv, nickie   xoxo
