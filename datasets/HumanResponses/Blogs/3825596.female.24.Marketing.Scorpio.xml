      This post has nothing to do with my music career, but I have to post this today.  Yesterday afternoon I was reminded of the cruel intentions of people in this world.  Most of you know I am the Director of Sales (as my daytime job) at the Lake Guntersville Holiday Inn Resort.  I love my job!  I enjoy working with all types of people and I enjoy providing a service for people.  However, once in a blue moon, you run across people who are rude, demeaning, and just plain UGLY.  Their attitudes ruin their physical appearences even.  A female (dare I say a LADY) at our hotel yesterday, when she had a problem getting accomodations with us, used phrases such as "do you need me to come over there and show you how to use that computer?" and her husband added (as we were working to meet his needs) "you act like you are trying to do me a favor." I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing.  Two grown people acting like children.  I was embarrassed and sad to say that I hope they are not involved in a church somewhere.  I dont mean that I hope they are not saved and I would never wish evil on someone, but I pray that they are not living in hypocracy.  My Lord teaches me daily to love people and be treat them with respect and kindness. I just dont understand how some folks could be so...how do you say it...MEAN! My prayers today are for them.  I hope that each person who reads this post today takes a second to re-evaluate his/her attitude and remember that its always better to JUST BE NICE. Be blessed!!

      This Friday I will be leaving for an appearence in Texas.  I will finally get to perform for some DJs and (I assume) the public as well.  I am pretty excited about this because I have never been to Texas.  Adam Knight, my PR guy will accompany me.  The projected plans are to visit San Antonio, where I will perform, Houston, Ft Worth, and Dallas.  They say everything is bigger in Texas, maybe my career will get bigger there too.  I will post something after my trip and let all of you know how it goes.  Hopefully, something wonderful will happen there.  Also, I hope to get to see my friend Thomas who is currently out of the country.  He is visiting London.  I cant wait to see him!  I'll keep you guys and gals updated on new events.  hopefully our calendar will begin to fill up soon! Have a wonderful week!  The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas ;)

      Well the Lakeside Summer Concert Series sponsored by the Mountain Valley Arts Council went pretty well last night.  I sang about 12 songs.  The weather was unbearably hot!  I really sweated out that performance.   Coming up in September of this year the Mountain Valley Arts Council will be hosting a musicians festival known as MOVA.  This is a songwriters competition and an exhibitors fair....It is a wonderful weekend event that everyone should check out.  I was able to sit in on some of the song selection process as a judge.  I really enjoyed the creativity of some of the artists and think everyone deserves a gold star for effort!  CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! Check out the Arts Council website to learn more about the event!   www.mountainvalleyartscouncil.org

      I just got back from Branson Missouri.  It was a long trip to say the least.  I met some really nice people and saw a part of the country I had never seen before.  TROUBLEMAKER is spreading over the Southeastern part of the country pretty well.  And the single should be at radio stations by now...so call and request.    Tomorrow night JULY 13th I will be singing at the Civitan Park here in Guntersville, AL.  The show starts at 6:30PM and its a free concert sponsored by the MOUNTAIN VALLEY ARTS COUNCIL.  There is a $5 donation requested...so if you come please donate ...the Arts Council needs all the donations they can get as they are a non-profit organization.   The next trip will take me and the album to San Antonio TX the first weekend in August...so all you Texans come out and see me...    Otherwise I dont have anything scheduled till then.  Got a booking idea?  give me a call, we'll be there!

      Hi everyone!  The booking agent I hired CLARA RAINWATER will start on Tuesday August 24.  She will be emailing and phone calling everyone.  If you know of a booking date I might could get into please call or email me or Clara.  My cell phone 256-558-6008 or home 256-582-0948.  Clara will be at the home number as well so you may get me or her...she will also have an email address I will be posting once I find out what email address she will use.  Until then you can email me  stage_taker@hotmail.com  I also wanted to let you in on a little secret. K98 in Scottsboro, AL has almost refused to play my music.  However, they are receiving A LOT of requests for TROUBLEMAKER.  If they get an overflow of calls for the song they will be almost obligated to play it.  The number to the station is 256-259-2341.  Call and drive them nuts...even if you dont like the song call and request it out of spite.  The station manager there said they will not play it because I am a local girl.  What will they do when this little local girl charts?

       urlLink    Minus the smile this is the picture we used on the cover of my album TROUBLEMAKER.  I also wanted to let everyone know that my Cd is being played right now in Las Vegas.  The station there in the city 99.1 is playing the title cut TROUBLEMAKER and #9 on the album HEARTACHES AND HONKY TONKS.  Those two songs are currently the most requested songs in Clark County, Nevada.  I am totally psyched!  I hope everyone gets to hear them soon.  Those two songs will also begin play on K98 in Scottsboro and 102.1 in Huntsville this weekend.  Please call and request them.. Love Kelley
