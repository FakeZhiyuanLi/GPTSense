       Tulip, pg37.  So, its been two weeks since i dreamed up my incredibly self, uncreative plan. Sure it'd be great if i could get that far, but so far its not going to well. I havn't spent any time with my real friends or even my fake friends latley and they think im avoiding them and yes, they are mad at me. The help at home thinks im sick and keeps trying to get me to a doctor, and daddy won't leave! By trying to be invisable i've drawn more attention to myself and it sucks highly. I have been taking money out of the daddysfinallybeenblowntobits fund, so i guess im making progress but this id gonna be harder than i thought! Poo is really excited about getting out of here so i don't want to dissapoint him, ill just be patiant. I think for now ill go make us some beagals with creamcheese and gummybears, then ill think of a new and improved plan (aka, how do i get everyone to stop worrying so i can leave in peace?)....  I got it! i know how to make them beleive im fine, i've done alot of thinking and i finally came up with a semi-good idea. I won't. nope, i'll just go and no one wil find me ever. Then they will finally realize how much a hate the lot of them and can't stand their faces. i know thats not nice beacause they take care of me and make sure im safe blah blah blah bull shit. I've only been kidnapped once and i found a way out of that myself! I think I am quite ready to be out on my own in this world on my own. well of course poo will be with me all the way. I wonder if they let goats on plains?. I'll just have to make up some good excuse if we ever make it to an airport. Ugh someones knocking on the door, i bet its daddy coming to tell me he has tickets for some big event and hes wondering i woulnd't mind not going this time so he can take a "special friend" instead.  Hey i was wrong! I mean. it was daddy, but he came to tell poo and i that he was going to have to go away for a couple days to research a location for a new project hes working on. This is a perfect oppotunity! He thinks i won't even try to get into any trouble because he will be back by thursday and today is monday. I grins do I. Later tonight I'll go get the rest of the money and get all the things i plan on taking (wich isn't much) together, then ill call Amandese, my best real friend, and her that im sorry for not being around latley, so at least one person won't be mad at me when I leave, ill just sleep better that way. But for now i have to take Poo for a walk, Ill write again after I have the money and I'm ready to go.

       Tulip pg.36  Ok, maybe sometimes im abit harsh on people for not understanding, but they should try hoarder. If Missy Cookied was still here she would  know what to do to make me feel better. She was my only family besides my dad, she was his mom and she never agreed with his lifestyle. But she died when I was 9, so now im alone. Well sort of, im never really alone, theres always someone here to clean up after me or entertain me but they only do it for the money.  last night while I was lying in bed thinking, I cam up with a plan, wanna hear it? poo liked it so maybe im not completely crazy. Anyway. I know dad has money put away for me encase something ever happened and I need it fast, I call it the "whendaddyfinallygetsblowntobitsmoney" but I think this is an emergency and I need the money fast, so no one can get mad at me for using it. Right? Well, what I plan to do with the money is run away. Or rather, disappear with out notice. And in order to do that ill have to disappear before I actually leave, so no one notices im gone. To do this ill have to wait till daddies away on  of his little get-aways and then ill have to just avoid everyone, but make sure they see me once in awhile so they think im just a sullen cow. ill just have to stop doing things and going places with me few real friends. ill tell them im busy doing family things (o never have told them I have no family). ill take the money out of the bank in slow bits so not to raise any eyebrows right away. And when im finally sure that no one will miss me till im far enough away not to find, ill go. ill just catch a plane to somewhere and go. Poo, Tulip and I will find some tiny little town, maybe in Italy, and we'll fit in great with the locals and become friends with the whole town and no one will ever know my last name or where I came from, they'll just accept me for who I am. And if all goes well, ill be able to call up my dad in a couple years and say whats up? And he won't be mad, he'll just wanna come visit me and see my new life for a week or so. But that would be the only contact I want with him. And maybe one day ill meet some random guy and randomly fall in love and live happily ever after...[sigh]

      I'm 16, and a girl, and i need to get out of here. L.A. is deffinatly not my kinda place! all the women are so skinny  and perfect and then theres me, the blob. i mean, sure i have lots of good friends and i have fun all the time and lifes just one big party. but the only reason most of these people hang out with me is because of my dad , i won't drop anynames, but you'v heard of him. He has won all kinds of awards and shit, i got a cummunity service award when i spent an extra hour cleaning up the park after my parol was over, i lost track of  time. everyone is just always trying to push me farther, like i have to be a miniture version of my dad and do exactly what he did and make lots of money and then piddle it away on whores a cigars. i wish i could just go somewhere and be all alone for a while, just me and poopsy. poopsy is a minigoat and hes my best friend. i guess you would think thats weird, but hes the only one that doesn't disagree with everything i say. me and poopsy write down everything we wish could happen  in tulip. tulip is our journal, the one with the pirate skull on the cover. we mostly write about all the places we want to go, dad gets to go all over but we have to stay here and "hold down the fort" as he puts it. but my and poo know he just doesn't want us to get in the way of all his "good friends" who all happen to me women that look like they just jumped off of a covergirl billboard. i just wish me and poo had somewhere of our own where we could go and be alone. away from all the busy-bodies searching for perfection, and then taking out their anger of not finding it, on me.

      Tulip, pg. 38. I  hate  airports. There is so many poeple here! holygod... Its a good thing i look old for my age otherwise they wouldn't have let me through security and customes and all that shit. Well I'm here now, me and Poopy are just sitting here in the airport waiting for our not so mysterious mystery plane at land so we can board and be whisked off to some not so-unkown unknown counrty. I wanted to have no idea where i'm going but the pinfaced lady at the ticket getter place said she couldn't just  give  me a ticket to anywhere, so i'm going to London, I figure i'll just start my adventure all over again when i get there. Oh i bet your wondering how i got Poos in here? Well it wasn't so hard after all, these american airlines are really slacken, i think they need a whippen! No, just kidding, anyway, all i had to say was that he was for a movie and hes the main character and demands to ride first class because hes already late for shooting and he has a terrible head ache. that didn't quite get them, so i proved who my dad was and right away I had a personal escort at my side, who i shunned and asked for a VIP card instead. So here we are waiting for flight B87. Oh My God! everyone that walks past just HAS to give me that  look . you know, the one that says "um, are you lost little satanic dolly?" well maybe you don't know it, but people just cant get over how i am nothing like my dad! I've only seen 2 other people here wearing band shirts and studded belts, but they were sucky bands, this sucks. But those looks arn't the worst, the looks that say "GAH! what the fuck is that goat doing here!" are the absolute suckfest. I'm sure Poo won't even remember this  horrendious airplane trip once we get to where we're going, wherever that is. I think its time to crank the slipknot and read a story to Poo....in my head...people don't understand that talking to a goat is not unhealthy.

       ok so I wrote this while I was going to sleep and then I forgot it so this is all I can remember...     &nbsp;   The door slowly slides into place and all light that was is no more. The way is shut   .  My naked body lays cowering in the shadows and. Feelings of fear and exasperation subside as my eyes roll back, to stare into my&nbsp;depleted mind.&nbsp;I cough and splutter a last breath of aspiration.  My fading body&nbsp;weakens with pain and I long for the cruel familiarity of an icy blade. My frail hand reaches for the wicked relief and my exhausted mind searches for any shred of life but only finds anguish and despair. The bleak metal stings as it slices my raw&nbsp;exposed skin.  My quivering body relaxes and melts into the wall as the crimson malignancy drains from my sickly arm along with all emotion and will.  My empty body lays in the shadows of the&nbsp;deepest fathoms of my tortured human mind, unmoving, umwanting.   My body lays no where.

       i just realized how much i actually dont hate. i mean, i say hate so lots but i never mean it. like hillary duff *shrudder* i dont hate her i just cant stand her, if anything i respect her. shes just doing her thing and making tons of money doind what so many young girls would love to do! like even us would like to be actresses or make music and get payed for it so good for her. i just hope she never has a hit single again that i will have to listen to over and over and over. Same with avril, they wanted her to be a country singer but she didnt want and they wouldnt let her sing punk songs so shes herself through her style, shes a solo artist so its fine that she picked her band out of a room i think i respect her to for just taking all the shit people throw at her for "being fake" and n ot killing herself. and evan is hott! XP the only thing i really really hate in music is when people like madona and missy elliot and metallica freak out about downloading! goddamnit they are so rich already! not selling a couple records isnt gonna make them go broke.  havnt they seen that south park episode??? everyone should watch south park. and BUZZ!! lol mista mo...

        oooh last night a had a strange strange dream! i wont go into detail but it was one of those oddly freaky ones where i end up doing something i will always regret. but there was 6 bodies, in camo/blue bags sitting in a circle leaning on eachother right behind me here at the computer but we didnt know if they were bodies so being as stupid as i am i decided to find out so instead of looking in the bags i like jumped on them and started banging them around and then i got that feeling that i always get when i have that kind of dream where i cant watch the rest of the dream but i have to to get  past it. but this time i started blogging about it in my head and it went away! blogger isnt useless!

       Day 33: Boromir tempted by Ring. So tedious. Cannot be tempted myself, as already have everything I want i.e. perfect hair and a butt like granite. Have been getting very strange letters from someone calling herself "megalo_maniac" who wants to do obscene things to my elfhood. Fortunately have super-duper elf vision so can run away if I see her coming.    Day 35: Boromir dead. Very messy death, most uncessesary. Did get kissed by Aragorn as he expired. Does a guy have to get shot full of arrows around here to get any action? Boromir definitely not prettier than me. Cannot understand it. Am feeling a pout coming on.Frodo off to Mordor with Sam. Tiny little men caring about each other, rather cute really.Am quite sure Gimli fancies me. So unfair. He is waist height, so can see advantages there, but chunky braids and big helmet most offputting. Forsee dark times ahead, very dark times.     Day Six:Woke up to find Aragorn playing with buttons on my shirt.He must be after the Ring. Damn its siren call.Ah well, Sam will kill him if he tries anything.    Day Eleven:Gandalf showed me very strange trick he can do. Apparently pointy wizard hat not just for show.Wonder if Ring is affecting him, or perhaps he is just v. peculiar.    Day 27 : Lothlorien so pretty. Galadriel pretty too. Offered her One Ring, but she kept saying, "No, there's something else I'd rather have from you, Frodo Baggins," and trying to slide foot up inside my breeches. So, gave her my extra pair of breeches since she seemed fond of them. Maybe some kind of breeches shortage in Lothlorien    Day One: Frodo stabbed by Morgul blade. Oh no! Pippin cried. Told Pippin it would be all right as Mr. Frodo far too hot to die.Did I say that out loud?  (i agree!)       Day Six: Mr. Frodo awake! Is doing well although also seems concerned as to why his fingers are all wrinkled.Decided not to tell him about all the baths.    Day Eight: Off to Mordor. Other members of Fellowship v. dodgy if you ask me. Especially Boromir. "Teaching Merry and Pippin how to sword-fight" my Aunt Lobelia. Obviously pervy hobbit-fancier who likes to roll around with small men in shorts.    Day Ten: V. dark in Mines of Moria. Used flat edge of sword to whack Aragorn every time he tried to pinch Mr. Frodo in the dark. Gandalf fell into bottomless pit. Mr. Frodo said something later about pointy wizard hat, but did not understand it as am innocent young hobbit from Shire not versed in wordly ways.Pippin says Legolas is shagging Gimli.Ick.    Day Twenty-Two: Leaving Lothlorien. Bye-bye grabby elf lady.Not sure where going exactly, but is obviously somewhere water-related, as have been given boats. Do not care really as long as get to share boat with Mr. Frodo.    sigh i think thats enough for now...

ME: oh yeah i was just wondering what the reason for all the whOOOOoooooOOOOOoooo dancing and the lookalikeawoman-ness was all about?      DUDEGUY: i was at musicfest right? and i was stoned right? dude you can do that stuff at music fest and people either wont notice, or they will and they'll come up to you on a ferry one day and ask you about it *smiles like he knows something*      ME:oooooooh i see, well you said you needed a ride so you can come with us if you wont! i think you and your awsomest awsome hat are worthy of it!

      oh im hungry...but theres nothing to eat and i already ate the things i wasn't suppose to so maybe ill just wait this one out. i think i need a pet. i cat actually, a bold one please. i hate it when people just generally think im dumb.im not, i just honestly dont care about proving to people that im smart. i also hate it when they think im just so very smart and ecpect me to be the one with the hightest mark. people in general are asstards. even those who seem perfect aka daniel johns get some bad press sometimes that makes them look like a complete jackass. but most of all i hate how its so easy to hate everyone and everything. honestly, if some one can just walk up to someone else who never did anything to them and yell   I HATE YOUR GUTS AND I WANT YOU TO DIE A PAINFUL SLOW EXCRUTIATING DEATH  theres got to be something wrong, hasn't there? well i think there is something wrong cuz right now the whole world is kinda running/dieing in someplaces, on hate for other people. but thats just my opinion that poped up to the top of my head at the moment. wow i love this keyboard so much :D i want to cut something to! i think ill cut off the sleeves on my casualties shirt and my lion king one. hehehe casualties and lion king. i like things that are completely different. why is it that i dont care about things like how i look? i hate that how even poeple who try to "go against the crowd" still get humg up and apearence. oh i have something else to hate! music! these days its all about looks! like, take your favorite band, and theres at least one pretty person right? and then think about the harlots, really good band but they are ugly, and thats why you havnt heard of them. ugh but then theres the select few that are just all round ugly and sucky. anyway...what was i gonna say? i think  iv been here for to long. {i wasn't serious about the walking naked thing}i really like the hives! thats what i was gonna say! i have liked them since i was eight and i still like them. :) like greenday and blink 182....mmmm....
