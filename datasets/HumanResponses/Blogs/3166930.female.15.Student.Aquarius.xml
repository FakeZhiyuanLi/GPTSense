      I called Thomas today.. n we quarreled again.. i felt so upset.. he told me he wouldn't be bothering about me anymore.. When i gave in and asked him whether he still wants me to go with him for the NDP, he rejected me.. i felt so upset.. haiz.. izzit onli love when he is hugging me? haiz.. I swore that i wun call him for three mths.. haiz.. i wonder whether i can realli do that anot.. haiz.. i am beginning to regret what i have said.. haiz.. It's a matter of time when i have to let go of this relationship.. It's also a matter of time when we r finished with each other.. he told me i am petty.. haiz.. Narrow minded.. am i? It's just tat he dun understand me enough.. i am not.. i am just too sensitive.. haiz.. Sensitive to his words and everything concerning him.. i dunno what to do.. i felt sick.. i am sick.. Yet he is not there to acc me.. Comfort me.. i badly need someone by my side now.. Stomach has been hurting for days.. i dunno why.. i am scared.. haiz.. i dun wan to.. haiz.. i want him to acc me see the doc.. haiz.. i wanna him hug me and hold my hand.. Telling me tat everything fine.. But it's not possible from today onwards.. Sadness overwhelmed me and i realli dunno how to face it.. haiz..
