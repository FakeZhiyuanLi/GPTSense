      Hello world!   Yes, well... umm... I've just started this journal, as you could probably tell, and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals, I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However, comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well, I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler, so I'll introduce myself, shall I? My name is Jennifer, but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth, I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane, Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not, I guess you can say, but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist, but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry, draw to some extent and even defend myself, as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!
