      done stinging for today. 20 stings today.  901 total stings since 04.09.04. Hit a couple of acupuncture spots today.  One was the middle of my chest (between my gigantic - lie - breasts). This is  a center shakra or place of energy conversion. I have a pain spot  there. My fingers swelled up the most making this post a little tricky.  Glad the stings are done for today. Will have to go catch bees in my cages for Wednesday. yahoo.  Off tomorrow to help get the classroom (where I will be teaching for 5 weeks) ready. I can't wait to meet my 21 first graders!!! 14 boys and 7 girls. I will not be sharing any info about my stings. But I will teach them about the fascinating community of honeybees.

      I love trees! Especially pleasant ones. Shade, oxygen, fall leaves..these are just a few of the benefits of trees. As I sit here this morning, drinking my french roast and watching Sesame Street, I am looking out the window and watching the birds fly from tree to tree. The trees allow us to appreciate the movement of the wind and the sun-watch the shadows. Trees also give us so many shades of green to appreciate. What about fruit and nut trees? Food, yes. How many other products that we 'need' come from trees? Countless! paper products that get thrown away--wood to build anything and everything-- I love trees.  today I will take another 15 or so live honeybee stings. I am working on my hands (my fingers are swollen and misshapen from the arthritis). I will sting 5 digits - both pinkys, b oth ring fingers and R middle finger. the L middle finger shows zero signs of arthritis. That particular finger is how I came to bee venom therapy in the first place.  Last summer, at the end of the school year, we had a swarm in our honeybee observation hive. I work at a school district run Nature Center. I teach Earth Education. I hike and teach with students from grades 1-6. Our hive is a teaching tool. The bees produce honey but just for their own bellies. We have off-site honey producing hives too. A swarm is not a bunch of bees chasing someone/something. It is actually a situation that occurs when the hive gets too crowded and/or the queen gets too old to continue successfully producing new honeybee workers.  We believe our queen just got old. A queen puts out pheromones to let the workers know she is producing and things are 'fine and dandy' in the hive. Her pheromone changed because she was old and unable to produce the eggs needed to keep the hive going. At the height of summer season a healthy queen produces (lays) 1500-2000 eggs a day! The workers recognized the change in scent and quickly took matters into their own hands to save the hive. They began feeding a few of the new larvae 'royal jelly'. The royal jelly allows the larvae to develop full reproductive organs and become a queen.  When the new queen(s) was born, a fight ensues for power and the current hive. Eventually one queen is decided to stay and the other queen and half the hive leave the hive in a swarm. They don't go too far--usually into/on a tree branch within 20-30 yards of the hive. They ball up in a swarm surrounding and protecting their queen. This new off-shoot hive then sends out scout bees to go find a new suitable home for the new colony.  Okay, where were we going with this? oh yeah. My finger. So we had this big swarm in a pine tree about 20 feet from our observation hive. We decided to take advantage of this new off-shoot colony (which most beekeepers do) and collect it to take to our off-site hives--free bees! So, we suited up with gloves, hat and veils. But, alas, I did not have real beekeeper gloves --so I just decided to use a pair of pink winter chennile gloves (dumb idea!). My partner had the tree pruners to snip the branch that the bees were balled up on and I was holding the branch to support it when it got cut. The weight of that many bees is truly incredible. So when he snipped the branch and it sort of dropped, even though I was holding it..the bees kind of got a bit nervous and started to fly and see what was up. We did put most of the swarm on the branch into a glass aquarium with a net lid, however, one very defensive young bee attacked my L middle finger. Right on the tip. It hurt like hell. I took off away from the rest of the bees because bees put off a pheromone when they sting and are in defense mode to tell the rest of the bees to come and attack. Anyway, my finger throbbed and was swollen for three weeks. It really hurt like hell. But, to this day this finger shows  zero  signs of the arthritis.  So this was the impetus for me to begin Bee Venom therapy.  I will continue to sting and keep posting my progress. It is almost the four month mark. I will probably sting for at least a year. We'll see. It is painful and not fun, but if I can cure myself of this crappy dis-ease (rheumatoid arthritis) I will do it. I am almost up to 900 stings. I kind of get excited about seeing the number rise. It's wacky but a great conversation starter! I look forward to reaching the 1000 mark. It's like watching your cars odometer turn over--for some reason it is cool.  Perserverence. Bee healthy and bee happy and enjoy trees.

       Where. oh where should I begin...   The title of my blog is  stings and ignorance . These are two themes in my life right now. I am currently involved, heavily in BVT --bee venom therapy--for the neophytes out there. Yes, I am stinging my body with live bee stings. I do this not for the pain, but for the healing qualities of the venom.  I have rheumatoid arthritis --pity me, not. I am curing myself, hopefully. I am also having a Sierra Nevada pale ale currently - not part of BVT!!!!!!  But, we have to enjoy life sometimes. A suitable beverage is optimum satisfaction in lieu of chocolate/sex/running or aerobics. I miss aerobics a lot. I tried to run today with my dog at the park. My movements were funny..very heavy footed. It has been four months since I have been off my traditional rheumatoid arthritis drugs and am only using BVT (and now acupuncture too since last week- I will add 'healing touch' therapy too). I just want to get myself well. With God's hand on my shoulder and perhaps lifting my quads, I may just run again someday soon.  For those curious-- BVT-- does not require me to stand naked waving my hands and legs screaming near a beehive to get stung. I have bees in a cage and I (or my sting assistant) grab a bee (HONEY) by the head or thorax (first or second part of body) with a pair of long tweezers. The bee is then set on a specific site, more on this later, butt down on my skin, and the bee does what it naturally does -- it stings.  Yes, it hurts. but it also is helping. Ignorance is bliss. can you imagine stinging yourself with bees on purpose? I have taken over 850 stings to my body so far. It is working and I will keep going.I don't have much else to say today- I moved on to an Aspen Edge - I'm watching my carbs. I only have adult beverages once a month- what a priveledge and good way to lose weight.  So long for now. I am happee.
