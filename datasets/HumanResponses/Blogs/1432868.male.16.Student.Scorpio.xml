      ok I apologize for the confusion and senseless uttering of Rianna but I failed to mention the other new blogger Ray (grim reaper). He is a cool Dj/geek/pimp/comedian/tall brown guy. Also I was just reading today  urlLink  they found some stolen art behind a toilet.    All I have to say is WTF. I mean they were fricken watercolors. Jesus christ are criminals that dumb now a days!  Note (ray): They were in tube containers.. i freakin told Jerry it wasnt enough, he wouldnt listen. oh well, he wont rat me out.

      [ music | Liam Lynch - United States Of Whatever (George Bush Remix) ]   guys, write for an audience, if you want one ;-) Heston's stepping down, cause he's forgetting his lines at the NRA meatings. "From my cold, dead... penis? that cant be right... can i take a nap?". one thing he did do, however, was fulfill his lifelong dream of being at least a co-star in a hit movie. He did that a few months ago. It's called bowling for columbine. it won an oscar. Yay for charleston heston!

      bad news for all you haters-of-geometry: We all live in polygons; the trick is ignoring them to the point where they disappear or loving them to the point where they change and expand....The astonishing thing is that you are never alone, regardless of whether or not you want to be.  No man is an island, and there are an ifinite number of points in the universe.  You're just a point, stuck next to other points for the rest of your life.  So don't war with them.  Our points will change, expand, and fade to match the changes in our lives.  But we are still points, remember that.  We are still connected by a thread of other points, and there's nothing to be done about it.  Sadly, one can't help but live geometry.  Happily, life doesn't have to suck as much as the class....  Life is what you make of it.  You are what you make yourself....In some ways we are islands.  But even islands enjoy connectedness--to oceans.  Islands need oceans, because without them they would no longer be islands.  So you need others.... yes that was the pep talk for the day.  i am now thoroughly disgusted.

      heres another penny for your thoughts: here at the center for the awareness of the dangers of dental floss (ADD), we try to shed some light on the number of alarming deaths caused by this mode of dental hygeine.   -for instance, did you know that exactly 5 people worldwide die due to dental floss poisoning? -or that every year, around one one-millionth of the state of wyoming's population commits suicide by strangling themselves with dental floss? -or that two people die every decade from using second hand dental floss and those are just some of the tragic statistics compiled by the ADD center.  we encourage you to make donations to the goatraper fund, named after a boy whose life was tragically cut short by dental floss. please email these donations to: viviane_caillean2006@yahoo.com.  any monetary contributions made will be thoroughly appreciated. thank you for your time and money.

      "It seems to me that in life there is a great deal more falling apart than the coming together of things.  it is as if things can be pieced together only after they have grown far enough apart for the person that dreamed them to think these things entirely unfixable.  but during those few moments where the world is less twisted and life is less diluted and things may be seen in a pure bright light--those are precious.  when things finally fall into place, that is when you know why you blundered through darkness, and why you dropped things along the way in order to retain the virtues that eventually guided you to this enlightened state of peacefulness.  these moments of reward and respite are few and far between; they are to be hoarded and guarded by the very core of your being.  above all, these moments should be preserved, for without them, what sort of half-life would we lead?"  i find the naivite very calculated, and the author is most definately a cynic of the worst kind.  can you guess at who wrote this flaming piece of crap?????

      feeling-jopyfull Music: When the world Ends (remix)  -Dave Matthews remix Paul Oakenfield hey I found this cool story about how bush may have to run as a write-in candidate in 2004 of the law is not changed.hee-hee the grand left wing conspiricy strikes again. Anyway I can see the results already The unknown Democrat:40% Dubya: 59% George W. Bush: 1% therefore the unknown democrat would win making us one step closer to ousting bush. another good idea is for democrat controlled states to pass laws to stop bush from running PERIOD this would assure the dems victory no matter how much they mess up. Also the greens might do better. So all you left wingers out there remember the code word is Sheer the Shrub GO GO GO... And to all those facists out there I will give you this message: your days are numbered

      advice for guys:   1.> That girl sitting over there that you are staring at DOES NOT KNOW YOU EXIST either go and talk to her or forget about it.   2.) You NEVER will get more then a 30% chance with a girl so don't even bother trying to be sure   3) The girl will almost never start the relationship. get yourself together and ASK HER OUT DUMBASS   4.>NO STALKING   5.> Try not to bother person when she is PMSing if possible (if she always seems to be that way, well then stay clear)   6.> Be mindfull of what former bf or attempted boyfriends have said about her. For example has she ever threatened to castrate them? IF Yes the run for your life!   7.> If she says no well your screwed so move on   8.> DO not delay!!!!! NOW or never   9.>If you have really fallen tha hopelessly in love well... your probablay screwed.     10.> Good Luck....Loser

      what a wonderfull rainy and gloomy holiday weekend wow what I think is amazing is the fact that the bush administration can say, with a straight face, that to protect our forest we must cut them down to prevent fire. maybe we should apply this elsewhere. Instead of having AL queda blow up buildings we'll blow them up before them. Now they can't blow up the builiding. Of course we can't use it either. Oh well back to the drawing board.

      Why do people have to be so stressed out about grades. In the long run noboby is gonna care about your 2nd semester grade in NSL. What they will care about is what you know and  what you can do for yourself (if self-employed) or your employer.           Also, I hate how people in Potomac are so stressed over what college they will go to. MY message is it doesn't really matter that much. No matter what college you go to you are probably going to like it. Second, in the long run it does not effect your pay or job level. There are Harvard Grads that are bum's in the street (not many) and people who went to unknown colleges who do great things. There are even complete idiots who went to Yale (dubya). Lastly,   fear not   for a college will accept you. It may not be your first choice, it might not even be your second choice, but one college will accept you.

      matrix: reloaded is a great movie I can't stand people saying that it sucked just  because it is not as good as the first one  No sequel could ever live up to the original the original is fresh and new. the sequel is not fresh  I have heard that Revolutions is supposed to be the best  anyway.

      I'm really started to get paranoid again. Dunno why, just today I was talking to Dori and Kira and I wondered if they were merely tolerating me or on the verge of not tolerating me. i really wonder if I am annoying or something. well back to work. today though when making groups 4th period me Jeffrey Caitlin and Kira gerrymandered ours into a L shape. Heh Loughridge hated that. He hates our little corner rebellion he does.

      wow I feel really sorry about that. I know how you feel my grandmother fell dead on the day before my birthday. Just remember to say goodbye before she goes off to surgery. If she comes out ok then well that is wonder full but if she doesn't... I wish I got a chance to say goodbye. It is the one thing I really regret not saying to her even though nobody could have predicted her death. you don't have to sound inspirational or happy and I don't think anyone would really expect you to be just feel confident that no matter what  she will be ok in the end.  have faith and remember you have friends to talk to. just saying I went out on a limb to do this cause last time I tried to comfort someone like this they hated my guts for it. so please don't do that!

      well, here's where i get serious.... my gramma's going to have hip surgery for the third time on her hip, because her doctor fucked it up--twice.  and she's having it in a few weeks.  i'm worried about her, i really am, because despite her optimism and her remarkable strength for someone her age, she's not in as great a shape as she used to be.  and she makes the best gravy.  its the only gravy i ever liked. and if she died i would have no more gravy and that would really suck.  and thats the only aspect of her (POSSIBLE, BUT NOT LIKELY, AND DEFINATELY NOT IMPENDING) death that im gona let myself think about at the moment.  im scared, she's scared, we're all scared about this surgery, so i gota play my part to put on a brave face.  i tried writing her a letter to read before...before you-know-what, but i cant think of anything to say that would sound inspirational or happy or anything like that.  i can only think that if she died, it would suck, because there would be no more gravy.  anything more than that, and i may lose another marble.

      This is most interesting. Daft Punk, a group that I like, has created several anime style music videos for their album Discovery. I recently learned that this Dec. they will release a the full album animated. Right now it is already out in France so it is kinda a bummer that I have to wait so long. Also the animator is Leiji Matsumoto isn't he the guy that does Cowboy Bepop? his name sounds quite familiar   if you are interested here is the site in French of course  urlLink Interstella 5555

        urlLink  The RIAA  is despicably evil.   First of all they are replacing social copyrights with their  urlLink own .   It has failed misrably to a good online music services that have a wide range of songs and does not become useless after you decide not to pay the monthly fee. (note: the apple istore is not included.)    The prices for cd's are outrages. ex. Beatles Abby Road costs more then it did then when it was first released    It has  urlLink made criminals of most of America     and finally it has taken advantage of so many artists in so many ways: As it is the recording company owns the copyright of w/e the artists does for 30 years. Now they are trying to slip "work for Hire" contracts which makes the company keeping the copyrights indefinitly. They get most of the money leaving the artist with a mediocre sum  urlLink this is not what I was looking for  but it will do the other article claims that the band members get about $14,000 each per album. They control what we hear on the radio through kickbacks and help prevent divirsity on the radio They have tried to put through legislation that could literally "bomb" your computer erasing your mp3s and possibly your entire drive Lastly they have been handing out lawsuits to users of p2p networks and handing out very heavy penalties that are almost absurd     ok done with my rant for the day good night!

I am praying, and anyone who wants to join me, to smite Pat Roberson and the leaders of the christian colition. They are not in touch with the majority of Americans. Futhermore, they are a danger to the american people. They need to "retire" permanently.  Tomorrow begins day one.   anyone like the name "Operation Christian Freedom"?

      I was trying to find some materiel this mourning to make fun of and was hard pressed. Suddenly when channel surfing I find the 700 club on. It was like an act of god cause at that moment they were showing a hour of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. I think that whenever a comedian is hard pressed for material they just go to the  urlLink Christian Broadcasting Network  and just look a little. Anyway they were showing operation iraqi shield or some such nonsense. Basicly stupid people with kids in the service send photos and Pat Roberson and the other 700 club members would pray for a divine shield to protect them. I just sat dumbstruck that people would do such a thing. Pray for your own kids, why have some guy who hosts a bad tv show pray for them.? Then my favorite part come on "Operation Supreme court Freedom(smiting)" I believe was the jist of it. They want to have 3 of the justices they don't like "retiring" in the near future. The new christian colition slogan is if we don't like 'em  Smite 'em.

      Found cool company  urlLink Magnatune: We're a record label. But we're not evil.  I think the idea is great. Try before you buy (streamed at 128kbps no less and entire song) the artist gets 50% (should help attract more artists) and artists get to keep rights to their songs. Not to mention that you can pay $5 bucks for any of this stuff. ($8 is recommended though) makes me want to buy some music

Well I apolgize, power went out and I found that computers need power so I just stared at a black screen most of the weekend. Without power it gets boring pretty quickly so I resorted to playing tennis and walking around Bethesda.  the storm was wimpy yet still knocks area into chaos. so odd.  anyways come tuesday something interesting may happen that hopefully will go off right so wish me luck. :-)

      yeah I know I haven't updated for a whiile but you know hard times. This Ap class is still gonna kill me but w/e. Now taking drivers ed. which is slightly more sporific (SAT word!!) than taking some Valium. but yeah, I am kinda not sure what to do know, I want to say something witty and funny that you actually laugh at, or I could just bitch and moan about stuff and spill my emotions to you faithfull readers (random guy/girl who clicks on the link to my site by accident). The only problem is I really don't have much to moan about. I am not so depressed/happy/angry/ w/e to be even slightly interesting. Well I'm gonna just be sitting here some more and think of something to write on this site but wait..... one more thing   20:33:00) Tim: whether to go the "i really like you" route or "wanna go out sometime" route (20:33:11) Jason: it always helps to practice with your lamp beforehand (20:33:28) Jason: they usually respond favorably (20:33:38) Tim: whaaaaaaaaaat? (20:33:51) Jason: just stay away from the walls they just ignore you (20:34:05) Tim: and the lamp DOESN't? (20:34:10) Jason: no (20:34:12) Jason: of course not (20:34:21) Jason: the lamp gets turned on  guys it was meant as a joke please do not take that seriously.  ehh I'm going back to my lamp.....  remember click my e-mail if interested in date!!

      i'm back! and i have not much to say but that i am starting a new story and here is a bit from it:       "  I would be going soon.  his stitches would be ready to come out within the next week, and he would not need me anymore....But i had enjoyed the company, and i held little hope that i would meet anyone other than the prophesied key for the rest of my life.  it was true, what they said in the mines; life was brutish and short.  atleast for them it wasnt solitary.      i dismissed these thoughts--they were useless.  if, in the strange event that i actually became attatched to someone long enough to care about their fate, my departure became imperative to their future well being.  left in my presence, they would wither and die, often in a violent and horribly painful manner.  i knew very well what i was, and what i did to those around me.  if anything, i was an apt pupil, and i had learned this lesson many times over.  the only thing i couldnt kill was myself, or the key, for obvious reasons.  but i'd be dead soon enough.  it was what i did with my remaining time that truly mattered.     *                               *                                   *      i rose and doused the ashes of our fire.  Coll lay asleep at my feet, shivering with cold.  while awake, he had insisted that i take our only blanket.  i was suddenly almost too exhausted to move, watching him chatter his teeth and curl up to block out the cold.  it couldnt hurt for just one night, i thought blearily as drowse crept onto the edges of my mind, it couldnt hurt to sleep.    *                             *                                         *      I almost did it. i almost relaxed enough to fall asleep beside him, curled under the shelter of our one ragged excuse for a blanket.  that showed a lamentable lack of control on my part.  it wouldnt happen again, however; in the morning i would be gone.  he could pull out his stitches himself."  -if you want more, just ask!!! oh and btw, im not really back.  im sitting in the library typing this up right now.  still no internet at my house, but im trying to get some service. -book of the week: the course of honor by lindsey davis -song of the day: i am a highway by audioslave -bye all!

      music: Coldplay-The Scientist mood: depressed   Well I think I may retire from blogging for a few days. I just haven't been very happy lately and I don't really want to turn this into an angst blog so I will limit my activity here. I need to prioratize and try to find what I really want and what will make me happy. Now that I have done what I promised myself not to do I think I will take my leave.

      Well party last night was cool....Had dinner, dropped salad on Ari's foot... The usual. After a bunch of people went off to hc Melissa drove our little band to Skulka's house to hang out Ray and couple other people ended up going to Melissa's house oddly enough or somewhere around there. We joked played games and had a good time. I think next time I will arrange party at Pines of Rome or something.

      I saw  urlLink Kill Bill  this weekend. Great movie. Sure it didn't have the most complex plot (REVENGE) but it had great scenes that really were interesting. Great fight scenes and some interesting humor throughout. What ticked me off though was that at Regal they tried to card me infront of the theatre. I just said I was with the guys in front of me and no harm done but the principle of the thing. anyways yes I apologize to my loyal READER for not updating more. been getting killed by AP english.

I actually almost had a nervous breakdown in a class over something I couldn't find to hand in. It was so silly yet I just have so much stress and pressure that that little thing set me off. I just dunno what to do. but something must be done.

It is a proxy that will go from school computer to my computer to internet. Thus stopping any administrator from finding what you are reading on the net. enjoy!

        i am open-minded!      urlLink  How indie are you?  test by  urlLink ridethefader   You're pretty knowledgeable about music in general. You like indie music, sure, but that's only part of it.  You'll listen to any old shit as long as it sounds good to you. You're not snobby about music at all, you  just like what you like. How boring. Curiously, this makes you popular with the opposite sex.     This has got to be off...I am not being surounded by adoring women....*looks left....looks right* damn remember if you want to date or talk about music e-mail me, plz?

       heh...it seems I have another varient of the nigerian e-mail scam.here is what it says:  Heru Nurwarsito Col (Ret) David Wong. OCBC Bank Singapore. www.ocbc.com PRIVATE AND URGENT. I am contacting you on a business transfer of a hugh sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and skeptical, but I am assuring you that its been accurately planned and will be carried out successfully with your full cooperation as long as you follow our plans and instructions religiously. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. PROPOSITION; We discovered an abandoned sum of US$25,500,000.00 ( twenty five million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$25,500,000.00) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin through my banks funds managers/clearing house overseas. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following; 1. Beneficiary Name and Address. 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before the transfer can be made.

      sorry I hven't been writing this week but I've been busy.  today was excellent. I took my ipod sat at my piano and listened to "The Luckiest" by Ben folds and tried to copy the piano part. It was hard but fun eventually I was able to get enough to start to sing the words and well that great. I don't think I could do that again any time soon though. I just got so lost in the music. I played beatifully my singing on the other hand needs some work but was passable.Later I found someone who did the same thing I did but wrote it all down so now I'm going off of that because it is a bit easier.  it's been a beatiful day

I had a great time (hopefully she did too) she coerced me into buying  Mists of Avalon  which I will read cover to cover right now :-P then despite that fact it was 19 degrees in downtown Bethesda we decide to go get some ice cream. of course nearly getting run over in the process, we ended with a small dinner at Pines.  btw. note to Caitlin I WON :-P

Not that I did or anything....In other news Bobby Liu died mysteriously on the bus around 2 am...... heh heh heh......( I'm just kidding!) it's fun...I almost got a picture of me looking really really stupid on the Tower of Terror but I decided that it was too expensive and I would prefer the world did not see how I looked on that ride.

      Well got back from state orchestra festival and we did very well. Straight ones once again(highest score). judges had really no complaints about us and we did a nice job. In less positive news my grades are still looking dismal despite my resolution to bring them back up. I'm just gonna have to try harder, get some help I guess. It's just a matter of pride to some extent. I have written 3 very crappy essays for english thus far...so that needs to improve before the final test NEXT monday, Music Theory is next Wednesday, and World is on the 28th.  also more of a reminder to self then anything else Laura owes me 3 bucks and Ron owes me 1.50.

      ah rediscovering great music is wonderful yesterday I was searching through my cds and found my Yoshimi Versus the Pink Robots 5.1 dvd it is basicly the original album (also included) remixed taking advantage of a surround sound system. What is really great is that The Flaming lips go all out in remixing being one of the first sacd or dvd to take full advantage of surround sound. The almost created new songs in the process. The circling drum kit of Yoshimi vs the pink robots pt.1 gives a different feel then in the original album version. It is probably one of the better music purchases I made. Best 20 bucks spent last year.

Here is a couple taken using black and white 400iso film (btw this is all the south rim)         and here is a good one of yours truly resting before continueing up(down??) the side of the canyon.

      I had my "remedial" drivers lesson today and the instructor was insane. He reminded me of Mike Myers in A View From the Top. PROCEDURE!!!!!! he spent the first 20 minutes going over how to start the car. Then he repeatedly asked me if I knew how to read English and if I knew the English language. That in itself was almost enough to make me storm out of the car insulted. I went on to have a so so lesson after this incident though but he still was a bit well crazy about the exact order of doing everything and saying certain things I was doing would make me fail the test when I knew it wasn't true. I did meet a cute Whitman girl named Jennifer. She was the person after me and when we talked after he got out to put some cones down we started talking and I believe we both hit it off pretty well. She is a sophomore, Chinese and it seems a bit of a language nerd (5+ languages). It was nice talking to her and I wish I could see her again sometime...    maybe over lunch perhaps? :-P

      I dunno why I'm feeling like this now but it's been bugging me off and on for a while I've written (but not published) some similar entries but I might as well get this off my chest here and now. despite the fact that I've made many friends since I was a shy introverted freshmen I still feel lonely. Great friends such as Rayhan, Brian, Jeffrey, Kira, Alex, and many more people have helped me greatly and I am forever in their debt.  Now though it feels like everyone is starting to hook up and I just feel alone. It is no fault of theirs, do not get the wrong idea from this I am happy for them. Heck I envy them in some sense. When it comes to stuff like that I fall over my own two feet. I just don't know what to do and I don't know how to say this to anyone. (you should see what mental hoops I'm going through to write this here)  I know i need to be more outgoing a bit cooler and maybe a lot more confident and a helluva lot less passive.but as it is right now especially after seeing so many people hook up makes me feel well like a loser. I feel like I'm a 3rd wheel (5th wheel?)  in groups.  I guess knowing what I need to improve is the first step to improving myself but how? their are no how-to books for stuff like this (or at least none that I would trust) I guess I just have to look at myself more and just keep looking

      gah I was just flipping stations feeling kinda bored and I passed by a couple movies based in NYC. (lot of them aren't there?) As I flipped I noticed the almost obligitory pass of the New York skyline and I realized very quickly that they all weren't quite right. All of them had been manipulated so that in some way the world trade center buildings were taken out. I wonder why they do this. It's been nearly 3 years since the buildings were destroyed. Why don't we let the buildings stand in the films. It represents how NY was during that time. Why must we be like Stalin and erase people in photos who don't exist anymore. I know it may still hurt some people to see those buildings as a reminder of what happened, but burying their image in history is not the solution either. We all know what happened so why must we deny it by trying to erase it from these movies. Besides they do a horrid job at it. The world trades center buildings weren't much to look at in the first place and after manipulation it can look pretty bad. that's just something that annoys me  [music-Bump of chicken Sailing day] (even though I don't know wtf they are saying.

      Concert was excellent we played well. Esther and Yuri's solo was awesome. Pirates went well but in Chicago the percussionists screwed up rather badly (Kill the drummer!!!) my parents were rather impressed by the overall asianess of the group though heh heh  Senior bios were (mostly) cool. Mostly funny, some not so funny...some looked like they were written by a 10 year old. now where was I...oh yes...the seniors. It's gonna be sad to see them leave  but I least I get to do I couple more cool things with them. Diana Keung and Jeremy Feldbloom are having a small concert (classical) day after graduation. Also, the orchestra is playing all ceremonial music for graduation so we get to send off the seniors too ^_^ It's been a long day g'night

This is our final concert and is featuring our seniours who are leaving very soon. Graduation will be June 1st  and well I can't imagine some of my classes without some of the seniors. I mean what's music theory without Sara Sankey? :-P oops I'll rant some more after the concert. Off to change into my Tux

       So last week I get a call from Levine School of Music asking if I could come to American University theatre in DC and play violin (they said mostly tune up) for filming. I kept thinking wtf is this all about? I say yes and yesterday I get there and I find that a bunch of us are getting bit parts (well in a 22 minute movie our 2 minutes is actually kinda big) in a surrealist dance movie. Yup, you read that right surealist dance movie. It is directed by a Russian named Vlad and people were dancing in the foreground. (if you ever see the movie look for my orange skinned ipod in the backround.) they have a picture of the (simple) music were playing with the words "slow" written on it by me b/c I kept rushing.   It was fun, but also very, very weird. the cellist was picked to be the main character in the movie (random choice) and had to come in for 5 hours the day before to run along the streets of DC while they tried to get the perfect take. Poor guy. Today he had to fall asleep on his cello (no small feat).   well it was kinda fun kinda weird and I'm invited to the premiere :P look for me as violin player #2

       Today was awesome. first I kinda got bored at home and wanted to do some driving so I took up Mellissa's offer to visit her house. What I did not realize is that her house is one block away from the Gaithersburg border. My parents wouldn't let me drive alone so I drove with my dad in the car.:-/ It was great to see Naveed, Aditi, Mel, Amanda, and Ray again. We had fun doing some strange stuff... some not so strange. we looked at  urlLink this is not porn  and I freaked naveed out. Long discussions about aliens and odd skulls also occured.   After spending a good 3 hours hanging out, making junk food and stuff I was picked up and brought to Jeffrey Liu's house for Alex's suprise party. That was pretty good too. Amanda pwned us all in DDR, and everyone got squirted (with a squirtgun sickos) in the crouch. Now I am tired and wish to sleep.

Last time I messed up Parallel parking pretty badly this time I'm worried about turn in a box (maybe I should be worried about backing up 50ft too?) I don't think I'm gonna fail. I am a very good driver, I'm just nervous.   I think

       The beach is  great...Almost. The nice Sun, Warm water, fine sand, and a veritable ton of trash! It is appalling how much trash is in the water and on the beach. Plastic bags, cigarette butts, tangled lines, plastic bits, and even driftwood (with rusty nails included). It is unbelievable how far people will allow this dumping to go. DOES ANYONE CARE?! Does anyone worry about how they are ruining the beach for themselves, the animals, and others. Does anyone care that this earth must support us for years and years to come? Do they even consider what their trash is doing?   In part I blame the major push for recycling in this country. I think it gives a false sense of us helping the environment. Yes, recycling is good, but it pales in it's effectiveness next to conservation and reuse. Instead of throwing away the empty water bottle why don't people just go use it again? Their is so much people can do that will benefit everyone. Instead everyone feels that if they "recycle" they can be more liberal with the conservation and reuse without guilt because, they recycle. Although recycling is a good thing, it is far from a effective solution.   The only effective solution is to make people care. Make the boaters care and make the beach-goers care. I only hope it is not too late for us to reverse this saddening trend.

      So Ft. Lauderdale is so much fun right now. warm water, nice pool, and nice waves. I was planning on using the audio blogger service but my dad decided to buy internet so whatever. I never want to hear my voice recorded again after that test therefore I don't think I'm gonna be recording too many more.   One of the things I've found most interesting since I decided to announce my gmail invites on my site is that everybody who knows about them wants one. It really is the best marketting I've seen in years. Think about it, they limiting of the inital beta did nothing other then to build curiosity. The invites allow to basicly make beta testers the advertisements for their service. It is really quite amazing. Everyone who can't get one wants one. Of course it helps that almost all of the feedback for gmail has been positive.   The interface is one of the best web UI's I have seen in a while. Very little eye-candy, but very snappy. The organization is much like a online forum. It has your mail, then reply, then your reply, and so on and so forth. Spam blocking is pretty good, although I haven't tested it completely yet. Of course all the extra space is nice too. ^_^   So anyway when I get back on monday I'll start giving out Gmail accounts again...maybe even to some of the random commenters I've gotten stuff from.

       I've been noticing some trends...    It seems that almost everybody has a blog these days. Also, there has been some interesting trends as to what service they use. most of the Asians seem to use  urlLink Xanga  another group (more mixed but somewhat close nit) uses  urlLink Livejournal  and then me....using  urlLink blogger  service and possibly changing to movable type or similar. (of course it was through blogger I got my  urlLink Gmail  account so maybe I should stay loyal)Maybe I should either 1) get others to start using blogger or 2.) find a way (software) that would update all 3 (blogger, livejournal, xanga) at once and keep them in sync with eachother...actually that would be an awesome piece of software....hmmm I think it's time for me to learn some proper programming...

      man it's been busy, first graduation then Jeremy and Diana's concert, (Which was so so awesome both of them did an excellent job.) and now debate banquet. Was nice, some interesting code conversation was overheard between Tim and Alex Rabkin, and once again the legend of the Katie Minnock conversation lives on. (That story was started right here by the way uncovered by yours truly) bwhahaha.  Now a final (deciding) math test and math exam... then I am DONE!!! DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE   can see I'm excited?

      Well the graduation gig is done and that is the end of orchestra for the year. whew.. It was also the final time I got to see the seniors, some I am proud to call my friends, some I wish I got to know better, and some I never met before in my life. Still it's sad that they are gone.The gig overall went well. Suprisingly some people were listening as we played Pirates of the Caribean in prelude. 7-8 run throughs of Pomp and Circumstance, and Aeidu. Saw some of my teachers...(including ones I have stuff due tomorrow..and of course I haven't done it yet eek!) Said goodbye to some seniors. and there goes about 6 hours of my day.  I'm tired

      This weekend will be taken up by a trip up to NYC to visit some friends and family. I'm less then thrilled.  My friend Amanda is only going ot be their for a couple hours (needs to go to some party)  we're only seeing my cousin for dinner.  and my least favorite cousins are going to be their for much much too long.    plus...after you've been to Newyork enough their is nothing exciting really about it. Cheap sunglasses, bags, and watches...oh and don't forget dvds...but otherwise it's not exiciting...it's living.

       I am so fricken glad I got a hair cut today! I found a clearance sale at Myer-Emco and thought that I would check it out.    well as it turned out their was a nice pair of relatively small Boston Acoustic speakers that were calling to me. Nice sound and small enough to fit as computer speakers. It turned out they were $60. I'm one happy camper...

      hey everybody!  I'm over at Mount St Marys in the middle of nowhere MD. Overall the 11 of us have had a good time. I'm rooming with Jeremy, Ben, and Brian. Evelyn, Sam, and Amanda are across the hall. Shira, Caroline, Jackie and Nancy are down the hall. When not in class we've been mostly chillin. Done a bit of swimming in the athletic center but that's about it. Hopefully I can get some tennis playing in while I'm here although I'm the only one who brought a racket. Later all.

      I forgot to tell this tale from NYC so I will tell it now. I was in my cousin's house and they have this massive home theatre system in their apartment. I couldn't get it to turn on. So I thought he unplugged something. I reach behind to trace the wires back and I run into the power outlet that is sticking out of the wall.....what fallowed was pain and electrocution. Got a nasty burn and a bad headache but otherwise ok. Hey...it may even have helped quite the voices in my head :-P

       Well once again I'm back from a trip. This time I was off to NYC for a visit to some friends (at first I thought Baltimore but it changed) anyways I have calculus camp tomorrow. (yay?) and I feel sure that I'm going to be moved down to Honors calculus but you know what. SO WHAT? I'll be taking calc in college anyway. A lot of people never take calculus in High School at all. Why should I worry so. I'm not wonderful at math.   NYC was fun. We met 1 cousin from my mom's side and 2 cousins from my dad's side. I also met my very old friend Amanda who I haven't seen in a couple months so that was fun. She's doing well. She told me about some site called  urlLink myspace.com  that sounds rather interesting. Another one of those online community things. Sounds like  urlLink orkut  without the invitation thing.      I need to find out when this damn calculus camp is anyways and then maybe chill for a while...Or work....One or the other.
