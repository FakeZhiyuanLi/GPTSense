       urlLink The Revealer  has a nice piece by Amy Sullivan entitled  urlLink Religious Men , showing how spotty and shallow is the coverage of the religious activities and beliefs of the two major candidates.  I must admit to some curiosity about Ralph Nader's religious inclinations; my guess would be he favors some incarnation of the Earth Goddess, which will only make him more popular among that 3% of the electorate that are already in Nader's column.  I'm still a bit puzzled why religion is shaping up to be a primary issue in the coming election.  There is a pseudo-war going on, after all, and we're in it.  It's not like there is a clamour by the electorate for more discussion of religion in national politics.  So what is driving the steady press coverage that religion is getting?  And will it last through the "serious" phase of the election when people really start listening?

      I'm going to add  urlLink Religion in American Life: A Short History   (Oxford Univ. Press, 2003) to my Good Books list, and profile a few  chapters from the middle of the book over the next few days as I read  through them.  I really think familiarity with the evolution of  American religion over the course of the 19th century and the early  20th is the key to understanding American Christianity.    Chapter 8  ("Prophets for a New Nation") - The Revolution was tough on religion--people were just too distracted with the whole affair to devote much attention to religion. There may be few atheists in foxholes, but there aren't many soldiers in chapels either. The break with England also broke with the established Anglican Church. The strong rejection of a national church (if not religion) by the new federal government meant America was undergoing a religious as well as a political experiment under the new Constitution. So there wasn't much continuity with pre-Revolutionary religious life.  After the Revolution, it was a new world.   The dissenting denominations (Puritans/Congregationalists, Baptists,  Prebetyrians) were a presence, as were newer groups like the Methodists and newly independent Episcopalians.  But what is most striking to me (reading this chapter) is the strong attraction of alternative religious institutions for many Americans.    First, Deism was a force.   For example, although Washington was a mildy involved  traditional Christian, he generally referred to God in rather distant terms like Providence, Great Author, or Invisible Hand (p. 176).  "He worshipped irregularly, rarely took Holy Communion . . . and regarded Jesus as a fine man but did not consider him divine" (p. 176-77).  Deism was largely confined to early elites, but that also meant it was highly influential.  Being non-denominational and non-institutional, it could freely contribute (through early leaders) to a sense of civil religion for the government and larger society without running afoul of the No Establishment rule.  Even today, "civil religion" is hardly different from watered down Deism.    Second, Unitarians were an important player in New England.   Early  on, Unitarians were still clearly Christian (I'm not sure what they are  now), but Unitarianism made an obvious break with European Christianity by rejecting original sin and the doctrine of the Trinity.  And read Emerson to get an idea how easily Unitarianism could move towards naturalism, for example.   Unitarians were educated, moral, and the complete antithesis of enthusiastic, emotional, revival  religion that grew stronger over the course of the 19th century.    Third, there were the Masons.   Most Americans just draw a blank when it comes to grasping the role  urlLink Freemasonry  played in American communities in the 18th and early 19th centuries.  Here's a quote that helps:    [Masonry] offered men a form of fellowship different from  ordinary religion, one rich with rituals, special clothes, and secret passwords.  The Masons emphasized brotherhood and fair dealing.  While some embraced Christianity, many others felt that people should outgrow that religion in favor of a more rational and useful one like theirs.  The Masons saw God as a grand architect who designed the universe according to natural law.  Their symbols centered upon the carpenter's square and the compass, building tools that suggested firmness of character (square dealing) and high ideals (aiming high, as the compass pointed toward the sky) (p. 179).  The American fascination with Masonry turned south in 1826 after the  sensational events surrounding the apparent kidnapping and murder of  urlLink William Morgan , a dissident Mason who supposedly disclosed details of the secret Masonic rites.   The  Wikipedia entry for Morgan also contains the cryptic note "Morgan's widow was later one of Mormon founder Joseph Smith, Jr.'s plural wives."   Now there's an interesting link.    Finally, there was stubbornly persistent "folk religion" that continued  to be practiced, largely unobserved.  "They used divining rods to  find water, amulets to ward off evil spirits, and special potions to  stir affection in the opposite sex" (p. 179).    Conclusion -  It was clear quite early on that Americans were  religiously creative and were remarkably unconstrained by traditional  Christian doctrines and practices.  Here, this is evident in a  stunning display of religious diversity, seemingly spilling out over  traditional Christian boundaries almost as soon as the Revolution  ended.  Innovation continued (we will see in Chapter 9) within the  Christian mainstream as new modes of preaching and practice emerged over the course of the 19th century.

      There's a  urlLink nice article from NZ  about the difficulties honest priests now face in the wake of the clergy abuse scandals [link from  urlLink The Antipodean ].  This shows how deep the tragedy really goes--everyone loses, both priests and laity, because so much trust has evaporated.

      Continuing to assemble Catholic links and resources, the first entry in my Good Books list on the sidebar is  urlLink The Catholic Church: A Short History  (Modern Library, 2001, trans. by John Bowden) by Hans Kung, the noted Catholic theologian.  This book is a little gem, leading the reader briskly through 2000 years of Church history.  There's nice coverage of recent developments too, as Kung was an active lay participant at Vatican II, although he's writing critical rather than apologetic history here.  No whitewashing but a good dose of sympathy, a nice combination for most readers.  I'll briefly mention two topics from the book.  First, Kung highlights the use by the medieval Church of false or forged documents to bolster its authority in religious and civil spheres.  One doesn't read much about this elsewhere.  Second, he covers at various points the long historical incubation of the infallibility doctrine, which fully matured only in 1870 at Vatican I, then almost surprisingly weathered Vatican II without significant modification.  Any Catholic readers who have read this book are invited to make comments!

       urlLink Bartholomew's Notes on Religion  has  urlLink a short piece  on the Good as New Bible.  Every common language translation meets initial criticism.  What exactly is the worry:  That it will make the Bible too understandable?  That the main ideas will be lost?  That some barely literate readers might have better access or comprehension of what they read in the Bible?  At least people don't get the gallows for translations in the vernacular anymore.  I can't wait for my local library to put a copy on the New Books shelf.

       urlLink Catholic Analysis  has a short post  urlLink responding to some basic arguments  in favor of gay marriage.  Here's a sample paragraph:   The response to these arguments is similar to the response to those who claim that one can't deny Communion to pro-abortion politicians because one can't judge the soul of the politician. In neither controversy is anyone asking a human being to judge the soul of another human being. We are speaking about objective, social facts and behavior. We are saying that the objective situation contradicts the truth and so announce to all in society that this behavior is to be avoided.    He does note that "[t]he struggles of a person with same-sex attractions are to be judged only by Christ," which shows at least a glimmer of empathy.  But when he says "we are called to consider marriage as the foundation of society, the fundamental cell of society," he doesn't realize that cuts both ways.  Gays argue that they deserve access to marriage for that very reason--because it is so important and foundational.  If marriage is good for America, then transforming gay liasons into gay marriages shouldn't be a bad thing, their argument goes.

       urlLink Meet Joe Convert  posts the occasional reflections of an Evangelical turned Catholic.  For example,  urlLink Joe was appalled  by his recent visit to a California congregation which billed itself as "a Vatican II community."  Try visiting Hollywood (way beyond Vatican II) and that congregation will seem pretty conservative again, Joe.  But do come back for another visit.   urlLink Relapsed Catholic  is another personal blog about Catholicism.  I think the title suggests one who was lapsed but now has "unlapsed" back into activity as a practicing Catholic.  You might check out her post on  urlLink imprecatory prayer , which will give you a nifty new term to use in your Sunday School class as well as some really choice prayer phrases to impress your hockey team with.

      I intend this to be an ecumenical blog offering interesting comments and open discussion on interesting religious questions.  Comments are always welcome and encouraged, and will only be edited if they are offensive or profane.   1-Your first blog?  A-No  but this is my first Blogger weblog (having done Radio and Typepad in the recent past), so I will spend the first few days learning how to make sidebar links and generally fix up the place using the Blogger template.     2-What exactly is the goal of Christian Inquiry?  A-Initially, to assemble a list of links of personal or group blogs, five or ten per denomination, that have a similar approach to blogging on religion--interested in asking questions and inquiring, rather than witnessing or doing apologetics.   3-Who are you?  A-Just a regular guy.  See "About Me" on the sidebar.  Enjoy!
