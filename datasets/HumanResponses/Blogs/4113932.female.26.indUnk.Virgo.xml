       urlLink    my favorite beverage now  urlLink     I started drinking coffee when I was 4th year college. I needed it to be awake ‘till the wee hours of the night for me to squeeze in everything that has to be done in a day (well, until 4am!) 24 hours seemed not enough for me to finish my school works, it was just so excruciating! But do I have any choice? Honestly, coffee helped me passed college (especially my thesis) with flying colors! *laughs*  Since then, I’ve been a coffee drinker. It kept me going at work. Being in a fast-paced multinational company like HP, I needed something to make myself a key player to the team. Coffee and  yosi , nice combination. Energy-booster. Then, it became a habit. Until this article caught my attention...  Listen up, coffee drinkers! This is an excerpt from the article of Lipton's ad. I have to agree with this. =)   You know that it’s all in your mind---small decisions here and there that multiply faster than you think, lifelong dreams that sometimes seem so real and yet in a split second seem to wander off completely. You know your mind can one day be a mine of ideas and suddenly a mountain of data. So what better way to begin any hurdle than having things clearer in your head? At the end of the day, it all boils down to having a clear mind.  There’s a world of difference between simply looking and truly seeing, between hearing and listening, between capturing information and crystallizing ideas. When your head is clear, it means you’re in place and everything around you falls in place as well. It means your feet are on the ground---you’re quiet but strong, you’re calm but collected. It also means you’re alert and ready to take on anything on your path.  And the secret to a clear mind is no rocket science, and follows no mind-boggling formula. It’s as simple as a cup of tea. Yup- it’s time to turn a new leaf and experience the power of tea. Like the rest of the world, you well know that Tea is good for your body- but are you aware of the wonders that tea can do to your mind?  Research has finally named the secret that has linked tea with mental vitality. It’s called Theanine and it’s found almost exclusively in the tea plant. Not a lot of people may know what it is but Theanine is certainly one of the big reasons why more and more are turning to tea nowadays as their beverage of choice.  Scientific research had validated the link between Theanine and a perfect state of calmness. Theanine is the very reason why you’re not a hyperactive when you drink tea as compared to when you drink coffee. But it’s also the reason why you don’t feel sleepy when drinking tea. In short, it’s the Theanine in your cup of tea that calms you in just the right way to put you in place and bring you to your “comfort zone”. And just as you’re perfectly settled, Theanine raises your level of mental alertness by stimulating your brain to increase its production of alpha brain waves. The effect is higher mental focus, better concentration and sharper memory. Studies have also pointed out how Theanine could effectively promote creativity. Now that’s when the miracle of Theanine unfolds. The unique combination of relaxation and alertness, of increasing mental sharpness while at your most comfortable state of mind and body, results in this renewed clarity of thought and mental vitality. Cup after cup after cup, the power of the leaf brings you to your natural groove.

        urlLink    Xmas party 2003.  Xave is really fun to be with. With all his hilarious gestures & dance steps, funny songs na pang kalma nya sakin lalo na kapag nagiinit na ulo ko at mga kakengkoyans na pang asar nya, I just can't help but laugh &amp; laugh in the middle of our petty quarrels. It's really hard to hide my smiles and laughters kahit na serious at galit na ako. Kainis! As we mature, grow individually and grow as a couple the more we turn out to be "  good friends  ". We feel so lucky that we are not just    in a relationship    but we're also the   BEST OF FRIENDS  . I never had qualms telling him what's on my mind and what I'm feeling 'coz I know he listens and talks with his heart and no matter what happens, he would accept me for what and who I am. It's such a happy feeling! This guy is a   TRUE FRIEND  , lucky are those who are friends with him. He thinks of other people first before himself. Sensitive. Sincere. Sweet. Protective. Loves his friends and family. A metrosexual---we enjoy doing "sort-of-vain things together": footspa, going to the salon, trying out new hair wax, serum, shine control gel, skin care and more other stuffs. I love this person!!! =)  urlLink

      I just want to share with you. I could definitely relate!   This is an excerpt from article of Dana Hernandez in the August issue of Cosmopolitan. Read on…   “Deliriously happy couples haven’t been blessed by the love gods---they’ve just adopted certain habits that keep their twosomes tight. Crib their relationship rules.”  “Deeply connected couples aren’t born. They’ve simply mastered certain principles that strengthen their link and maintain that initial magic.  Some women expect their man to posses romantic ESP but unless he’s been tuning in to Oprah, he won’t be able to decipher what’s bugging you and he’ll be pissed off that you’re expecting him to figure it out. Rock-solid couples however, dispense with the guessing games and vocalize exactly what’s eating them. Blissful relationships are built on strong communication, which means telling each other your thoughts and explaining what you want or need without pulling punches. Forcing your guy to read your mind while you brood only breeds resentment.”    I feel so lucky to have Xave in my life. I know he’s the one I prayed for long ago and God’s gift to me. It’s such a great feeling to be friends with you boyfriend and I can really say that the more we are together the more we become best of friends.  Xave and I have these bond-boosting thingy that we enjoy doing together. To name a few: - foot spa every other Sundays - going to the salon for grooming our locks - shopping together and we end up having his and hers of anything we buy =) - playing monopoly - watching tv/dvds - surfing the net - food tripping - pictorials *laughs* - sharing our dreams in starbucks - beauty and fashion  In the process he became a metrosexual, maybe because of my influence. And I love it!!!  I strongly believe that open communication is the key to have a good quality relationship. Being together everyday is not enough if you neglect talking. Even simple updating with each other can make a difference. Our life is an open book to each one of us. We don’t keep secrets and I don’t regret it. We also encourage each other to have a life of its own---he can go out with his guy friends without me and me hang out with friends. There should be a room for growth. Not just for the both of us (as a couple) but also as individuals. Life is too short to spend it exclusively with one person. It’s not bad to have friends, we love being with our friends. We get to learn things from their experiences at the same time share ours, too.

       It’s been almost four years since I was asking God to give me the ability to forgive people. Especially this one person who has hurt me the most. It never came maybe I wasn’t ready yet.

      Cyl is getting married tomorrow, August 14. A close friend of mine since college days. She’s also one of my true friends despite the  not so good  things that happened between us in the past which is a normal occurrence to anybody. Well, everything is forgotten but we never had a chance to talk about it. She’s the type of person who hates confrontations. But still, I love her and will forever be a dear friend to me.  Most of my memories in the past we’re spent with her. We’ve been party goers, dorm mates, officemates…I’ve always been true to my friends and I don’t oblige them to reciprocate the same intensity of honesty I show them. It’s their call. Though I get upset sometimes, of course but I have to accept the imperfections in her because she’s my friend. I also had shortcomings; I’m not a perfect friend, either. I’ve been guilty of not being with her when she needed me most. =( I wanted to make  bawi  and be in one of her most unforgettable moments in life---her wedding. I cannot attend due to some circumstances and it saddens me. =(  They’ll be leaving for the states afterwards. Yup, I have this separation anxiety. She’s so dear to me, like a sister I never had. I’ll definitely miss her. *sob…*

      1) Do what you love…and the money will follow. - Idealistic as it sounds, it’s true. I just about lost my sanity because I wasn’t happy because it wasn’t a job I felt passionate about. It’s nice to get paid for being happy.  2) Listen to your heart. - I believe in signs. If getting up everyday to go to work seems excruciating, if it seems that you’re PMS-ing all the time, maybe it’s time to reassess your career.  3) Allot some “ME” time. - Sometimes, no matter how much we love our jobs, the stress and routine of work will get to us. How to kick back from that? Spend some quality time with the most important person in your life:   YOU  . Sometimes it just feels so good to be alone.  4) All work and no play is just that ---all work. - When I feel the need to detoxify in the middle of a truly hectic workday, I whip out my kikay kit and put make-up on, or have a cup of coffee or light a cigarette. Make-up, coffee and yosi are all therapeutic and boost my energy for the rest of the day. So I put those breaks to good use. You need it, and you deserve it.  5) It’s all about balance. - Learn how to juggle family, friends, health, integrity, and work. Wherein the first four are made of glass, while work, is known as being fragile is actually a rubber ball. If something screws up, work will always bounce back. Work is just one aspect of your life. So don’t ever lose yourself in work.  My advice for anyone who is unhappy at her job? When in doubt, leave!  Work to live, not live to work. There’s a big difference between making a living and having a life. Be a lifeaholic…not a workaholic.

      I'm a bad person with good habits and I can really me mean to those people I don't like. I have this bionic sense of feeling, when I see the person the first time I could tell if she is likeable or not. Of course, I feel guilty (I'm not that bad not to feel anything) but I couldn't help it. Especially if the person is intolerable. For me, first impression lasts!  There's this one person I hate and I want to name her, Barbie. Derived from "barbers". (read: a person who loves to make unbelievable stories and promises things just to impress people)  The first time we met I felt the, uhm, bad vibes! I wanted to give her the chance, so I smiled. However, she's really a @#$%^&amp;*! she didn't even lift a finger to adjust to the people around her. Maybe she has this   primadonna   thing in her mind. Duh! Me, adjust for her??? She must be too good for me to do that! *bwahahaha!* I never talked to her eversince...just civil.  Circumstances made us see each other almost everyday. Worst, in one roof! Grrr! Oh, morning to be good when I wake up is a great effort to achieve. Hard!  I always believe that a person's personality has something to do with one's family upbringing. True enough, unfortunately, she was raised in a family of chaos. Due to her experiences she got numb, self-centered, careless, yeah...Intolerable! Though she shouldn't be blamed for that. It was not her fault to be in that situation. I felt guilty that I've been mean to her. Now, I pity her instead for not doing something to improve her personality. In my trying to help her, (see, I'm really not that bad...convinced?) I gave her a job referral. I wasn't expecting something in return...just a simple thank you will do. But I received nothing. Ok, it's fine with me. I wanted to test my patience one more time. Then, I offered her something---a Clinique eyeshadow palette for FREE huh! She declined!!! Again, patience...inhale, exhale. She still keeps on bragging stuffs about herself, things she has and she can do...she even promised a discount in MACY's. Wow, that was music to my ears! Sorry for me, all were just imagination of hers. Reason why we call her  Barbers,  Barbie for short. Did I mention something about patience? Naaa! Forget about it! =)

       I've been contemplating on going back to work. It was almost a year now since I was employed. Though I have a business to take care of, it's not yet operational. Construction is still on-going and it's like taking forever to finish because of the rainy season. I'm not used on being idle, I easily get bored and I'm beginning to have bore-buster shortage! Suggestions, anyone? =)

      Whether it's love or a job, its good to get a grip and just as important to loosen it.  Sure, it's apealing to hold on to something with near-martyr determination. But sometimes the wisest move in the growing up game is to walk away from the board. In my quest to find the best live-life-to-the-fullest strategy, I often resort to techniques I had been trained to use in childhood:  try and try until you succeed . Everyone loves a never-say die kind of girl, but how can you even enjoy all the adoration when you've just about killed yourself trying? Whether it's a job, a relationship gone sour, or pants that no longer fit, I keep in mind that I always have the option to turn away from it. In other words, try something else. Something different.  Growing up, I don't remember ever hearing this kind of advice. I don't recall being told to "quit and try something else". But I personally believe that when a door closes, more windows will be opened. True enough, leaving my previous job opened me to more opportunities. One is a chance to start my own business which I never thought would be possible at this early stage of my life. Though I'd still love to go back to the corporate world, I would prefer a consumer industry this time. Again, this is a different story.=)  Applying the same principle to relationships, a friend once confessed that she was no longer happy with her long time boyfriend. When I told her to leave him, she stiffened and reasoned that they had been through so much as a couple and  sayang naman  if she didn't make it work. I wanted to say that it wasn't working already. But the lessons that stay with me are the ones I learn on my own. If I'm not happy, I don't gag myself with the guilt if I end the relationship. If a guy no longer moves me, why not call it quits and move on?  All this, of course, easier said than done. After all, the whole act of letting go without breaking apart is a dissertation on its own. I always keep in mind that life is not one straight tightrope that I have to keep walking. The more roads I travel, the more divergent they are, the more I experience out of life. It's better to experience as much as you can. Be fearless!(except to God, of course) Saying bye-bye to something or someone may be a bitch, but it can also be the best thing you can do for yourself.

      I'm having these series of images, ideas, emotions occurring involuntarily in my mind during certain stages of my sleep and often times, it annoys me.  I dreamt of *Oreo* again! I've been dreaming about him countless times for so long now. After our 'so called'  closure,  if we can call it that way, because nothing was really put into end. (He has someone and I have mine, both rocky during that time.) I  try  not to think of him at all. Yep, I'm honest enough to admit it.  The moment our eyes met the first time, I felt there was something to explore. I was frightened so I decided to do everything to avoid him, or atleast not to be of speaking terms with him because of my boyfriend.  The more I stay away, the more we'd endlessly bump into each other. Again, my curiousity challenged me. I hate regrets so, I opted to see where will that chance take us. We had our moments. We enjoyed hanging out together, talking, just simply being together. (ooops! it's not what you think.) I can say that we somehow fall for each other... well, I'm speaking for myself this time=) I was moved by him. It became complicated for me (translation: what's with us?) because no one wanted to talk about it. No one was braved enough to start. Ok, fine...I was willing but he has his own fears which remained unknown to me. If one is willing &amp; brave and the other is willing but mousy, nothing will happen. To make the story short, we chose not to delve into it further.  I continued with my life project:   live life to the fullest  . I now follow my heart and do what I think will make me happy. Wherein sometimes it requires me to leave my comfort zone and later on finding out that I'm stronger no matter what the outcome. I detest regrets so I have to be strong and brave enough to put my toe in the water. Even if things wouldn't work out, I believe I would be a better person with all my experiences---good or not so good.  But then again, it boggles me at times on why he keeps on recurring in my dreams. Is there   something that should be done? Mystery.

       I don't just like to shop, sometimes I NEED to shop---especially when I'm in a bad mood. It makes me feel better! Sometimes I habitually buy things I don't need (translation: I love to hoard stuffs,  takot maubusan ). There are times I get into fights with my boyfriend because of my spending habits. Often times, (if I can get away with it) I lie about how much I really paid for the stuff I bought. =) Oh, shopping can be an addiction, bad as gambling. Yeah, maybe I'm  a bit  of a shopaholic...but I will never ever admit it to Xave! =)
