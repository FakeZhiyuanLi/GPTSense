       I think it's the first time I wake up at 9:30 for the past two weeks... I really should have stayed in bed this morning...  We finally had an aftergrad last night... I think we were about six from the class, plus a few other friends... not a big aftergrad after all, but a small nice party anyways... Julie and Jenna stole wood (tsk tsk) and I rolled full speed down the pit... after that, even though I hadn't drank one bit, I tumbled around... the dizzyness didn't go away for a minute or two, and for a guy that has motion sickness often... I don't think I'll be rolling anytime soon :P  I actually didn't do much today, even though I had lots of stuff planned... Since I woke up late, I couldn't reach the PC people, so I came here to go on the INternet instead... then, at 2, I went over to Maureen's to help her study for an exam that is coming up... I surprisingly remembered some stuff from way back last year... after that though, I came back here, and went home for supper...  Now, I'm babysitting (although the kids are sleeping) and I just finished my french oral for tomorrow... that's after my economics exam which I have to study for tomorrow morning *sigh* On the VERY bright side, it's gonna be my last day in high school forever!! HEEHAA!!! All I know is that most of the class is ready to go away from there... I'm very happy too, except that now I'm losing a class that followed me for 12 years... it feels kinda awkward... but I'll probably go back on Tuesday, when most of the class really finishes, and then we'll have a cry-off all together... I'm gonna miss them all so much...  Oh well, I think it's time to go to bed soon...  André

       well, it turned out to be a pretty good day... I now have only two exams left, both are on Friday, I finally got a job as a guide at the Vieux-Poste, I'm quitting my job as paperboy (5$ an hour is not alot), my exams today went pretty well, I'm calling tonight to get an appointment for my schedule for CÉGEP... things are going pretty well in my opinion :D

       I had the weirdest dream last night... I was standing beside two girls that I really like, although one is less in my thoughts right now... and then the second girl comes over and kisses me on the cheek two, three times, and even asks me to come closer! The weird part is that I am totally confused about her relationship with me (are we only friends, can it go farther...), but I think the dream outlines how I truly feel about her... I've always been the shy type, so (I don't think) she suspects anything at this point. What I can't see is if she loves me also, or if she is only being real friendly because I've known her for a while... I mean, I'm usually not the one starting up the conversations with her, and she seems to talk to me about things that she doesn't normally talk about with other people. We have become somewhat closer recently, but there is still a big step to cross before I attempt anything at all. It's been two years since it started up inside me, but I still can't find the courage to tell anyone. Oh, except two but I convinced them that I didn't like her anymore *evil chuckle*. I really do hope that something comes up, and that she tells me something concrete... all I know is that we are good friends, but I have no idea for the rest...  I think that, with this post, you get where I got the idea for the title of my diary...

       OK, I admit it... I got tempted by blogging once again. I guess my first two experiences (LiveJournal and mydiary.org) at blogging didn't teach me anything... the only thing I'm gonna do different this time around, is that no one is actually gonna know about this place directly... I mean, people who search up for it can follow it, and I'll be glad to have followers hehe... but I'm not gonna tell anyone about this blog just so that I feel like I can express myself more freely...  Well, I'll leave it at that for now

       I'm sitting here at this table Waiting for you to call Even though I know it won't happen And that you will be my fall  I keep on hoping I'll hear from you Day in and day out The rain continues to drop down But I will never doubt  Staring out through the window My head is feeling weak My eyes are filling with tears And they finally come down in streaks  The dreams have just vanished Reality is facing me I will never hear from you again Because you don't love me.

        My name is Gossip.  I have no respect for justice.          I maim without killing. I break hearts and ruin lives.      I am cunning, malicious, and gather strength with age.      The more I am quoted, the more I am believed.      I flourish at every level of society.      My victims are helpless. They cannot protect themselves against me because I ahve no name and no face.      To track me don is impossible. The harder you try, the more elusive I become.      I am nobody's friend.      Once I tarnish a reputation, it is never the same.      I topple governments and wreck marriages. I ruin careers and cause sleepless nights, heartaches, and indigestions. I spawn suspicion and generate grief. I make innocent people cry in their pillows. Even my name hisses.      I am called Gossip. Office gossip - Shop gossip - Party gossip - Telephone gossip. I make headlines and headaches. Remember, before you repeat a story, ask yourself: is it true? Is it fair? Is it necessary?? If not, do not repeat it. Keep quiet.      Great minds discuss ideas... average minds discuss events... shallow minds discuss people... Which are you?    By Ann Landers
