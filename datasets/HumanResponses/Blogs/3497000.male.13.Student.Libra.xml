      I was slightly late and when I reached the Orchid Enclosure, almost everyone was there. The planting and mixing of burnt soil and top soil. We constantly changed methods of mixing the composition of soil. First it we just mixed it normally, before we decided to follow another's team method of pouring in soil into the trough and thoroughly mixing it. Due to the lack of time, we decided to do the old way. After seriously wetting the soil, wefound out that the method we had adopted was seriously flawed. The soil that were mixed in that manner were clogged with water. Finally, we planted the soil. Another record set today by me is having recived scolding from Mrs. Teo twice. A little thing maybe you do not know, Mrs. Teo paints her toenails and pink lipstick. Shocking uh!  Au revoir   and  God Bless Everyone in this World

      As proposed, I will post essays and stories weekly on Friday, starting from today. Enjoy.                                          Death-The World, Are You Afraid Of It?  	      	Death. It occurs naturally to all humans, to all living things. It is a natural phenomenon so why should we be afraid of it. Recently, people have been more and more afraid of death, trying all ways to stop and halt death. Why? Because people fear death. They fear it.   	It is  very noticeable that the more civilized and developed society and country is, their people gradually grow more and more frightened of death. They cannot accept death. They think death as negative and should be avoided which is of course, sadly to them, not possible. On the other hand, people from villages or not so developed societies or communities are the opposite. They are not afraid of death and see death as part and parcel of life, something unavoidable, and in fact not fear it but accept it. They believe that death is something natural and know that life is never eternal so why are we, in the developed society who are supposedly to be more intelligent, be afraid of death?   	Have you ever tried consoling a person when he is dying? You would definitely have said, “Don’t worry. You won’t die.” Do you know how painful that is for the person? He knows that he cannot live much longer and yet denying him from death is especially painful. The clasp on him makes him so sad to leave this world. He knows that he is dying but yet you are denying him from doing that.   	Death is inevitable. Life is never eternal. Humans have lived long without fearing death until all so recently. When we understand death and take it as part and parcel of life, we would have achieved nirvana and the state of enlightenment. This is when we would learn not to fear death, but accept it and allow others to accept it to and release them from our chains and shackles of pain we have burdened them with.

      I am absolutely tired. And yet tomorrow I will have to go to school at 7.30 a.m. and my day will only end at around 4 p.m. Although I am tired, I am really looking forward to tomorrow because I will finally be able to see what I had always wished for, the planting of the sunflower seeds. I have a very tight schedule now. MRP due on Wednesday and Project Day on Tuesday. I am really running short time. Why can't I have more than 24 hours a day. Other than that, today has been an awfully boring and tiring day. Now I can finally go to sleep.   Good Night everyone and   God Bless You

      My Project's Day is seriously screwed after some very serious scurtiny by the judges. Paul Ho and Ms. Lethmi bombed and literally tore and shredded my project to pieces. I was bombarded with a volley of questions and Li Hao was not of any help. Not only did he not know what to say, what he had siad was contradicting the project itself. Sometimes I really feel like killing him. THink of it, he did not do what he was supposed to do and when he did it, it was just slipshot work. Pathetic. Worse of all, I had to work till two in the morning because of him. He went offline on MSN Messenger and still did not disengage his telephone line. Well, my Project's Day is screwed partly thanks to Li Hao. I just hope that MRP would be significantly better.  Au Revoir  Et  God Bless You!
