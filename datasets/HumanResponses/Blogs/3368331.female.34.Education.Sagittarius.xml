      “Sir?” “Yes, Coco, what is it?” “Necco is on line two, would you like me to put him through?”  Necco, finally! “Yes, thank you…oh and Coco…hold all my other calls.” “Yes Sir.”   A cruel smirk formed on Dee’s lips, he was so close he could taste it! Unconsciously, he began to smooth the creased leather on the arm of his executive chair as he grew minutely excited.  Necco would have an answer for him today, he thought, that he would.  In a smooth fluid movement, he adjusted his earpiece and microphone, and then leaned forward to connect to the call.  “Necco, tell me you’re calling with good news….or give me a good reason not to fire you.” “Whoa, whoa, whoa Mista K, ease up.  You know I’m your man.  The shipment just came in and I’m working the closing shift tonight at the Pussycat.  W-w-will you be by at your usual time?” The yearning in Necco’s voice excited him.  There was a time when Necco didn’t like to play his games, now it seems like he could not rid himself of the little welp.  “Only if you’re good, will you be good?” The momentary silence on the other end of the line told him that Necco was struggling mentally with his feelings.  He was both delighted and repulsed by what he felt when they were together…playing the game.  “Y-yes, s-sir,” he answered in a defeated whisper.  “Good boy, I shall see you at 6 then.”  “M-mister K, I-I jus--” *click* Dee quickly disconnected the call as he had no time for Necco’s inarticulate words of affection; he had things to do before he could enjoy the evening’s festivities.  Dee turned in his chair and faced the window of his corner office; the view was chaotic. It faced 45th Street and Park Avenue, which was a jumbled disarray of people, traffic and coffee carts.  He despised the city’s disorganization, its haphazard way of functioning.  He preferred things orderly, arranged and systematic.  Dee, born Delicioso Kandemhan, a joke of a first name given to him by his Spanish mother, had started at the company when he was 21 as an intern.  At the time the company name had been Ce & Ce Candy Co., owned by Cecil and Celeste Marzipan who had began as confectioners nearly 40 years before Dee arrived on the scene.  It had been advantageous of him to meet both of them at a company function where they took to him instantly.  After his initial period as an intern, he worked directly for Cecil and Celeste as an assistant, subsequently working his way to where he was today—an owning partner at what was now called Ce & De Candy Confectioners.  With his perseverance he had pushed the company from being the makers of a handful of different kinds of sugarcoated items to a corporation that included thousands of varieties of candies, from the exotic to the nostalgic as well as beverages and pastries.  Now here he was, 15 years later, in a position of power; a place he knew he’d always be.   “Sir,” Coco’s voice rose from the intercom and seemed to wrap around his lower body like a soft fur blanket.  Dee frowned, not liking that he had no control over his body when it came to Coco.  This was one of the reasons he never made any attempt to include her into his circle of sexual friends.  “Yes, Coco, what is it?” He barked impatiently. “You asked me to remind you about your appointment with your trainer.” Coco’s voice was cool and neutral and he wondered if he had hurt her feelings, just the thought that he may have broke through her cool demeanor excited him to the point where he almost asked her to come into his office. “Thank you Coco, I was just about to leave.  I’ll be reachable by Blackberry.” “Yes sir.”  Dee grabbed up his gym bag and walked determinedly past Coco towards his private elevator without as much as a sideways glance.  Coco watched him leave.  She stared at his tall, slim frame as it confidently strode into the elevator.  Damn he’s fine, Coco thought, no man should be that damned pretty.    She could still remember the day she interviewed for the position here; she truly thought she had no chance in hell in getting it.  There had been about 12 other women in the room that day to interview with Mr. Kandemhan, all white and she, the only black latina.  She overheard that some of the women even had MBA’s, Coco only had an Associates degree from the local community college; she couldn’t compete.  She was ready to leave when a coolly detached voice came over the intercom, “Ms. Villanueva, please come in.”  Coco started towards the oak wood double doors, wondering how the person who had called her in could pronounce her name perfectly, distinctly.  She even had trouble pronouncing it some days. She stepped into what she thought was the most unusual outer office she’d ever seen.  It was circular shaped furnished with only a huge circular cherry wood desk and high back leather chair.  A diminutive elderly woman sat at the desk and without a word pointed to the double doors behind her.  Coco continued on through the second set of double doors, faintly smiling at the woman as she past her.    Stepping through the doors, Coco’s mouth almost fell as she took in the huge two-level office that seemed bigger than her entire Bronx apartment.  A tall slim man stood looking out of the ceiling to floor windows that took over an entire back wall of the office.  The office itself was fastidiously ordered, there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. She studied the man’s appearance a moment longer before walking towards the enormous leather covered desk.  He wore his hair long, bound by what looked like a leather strap into a neat ponytail and his skin, what she could see of it, looked as if it had been kissed by the sun.  “Good morning Mr. Kandemhan, I’m--” He turned swiftly towards her and held his forefinger out to silence her.  “Absolutely Cecil, I’ll be there tonight, yes…yes… wonderful…send my love to Celeste, ciao.” Mr. Kandemhan turned his attention to Coco and she suddenly wished she had walked out on the interview.  Staring into her soft brown eyes were the coldest looking black eyes she’d ever seen, she could swear he looked at her with contempt.  But then he spoke, his voice seemed hot and cold at the same time; making Coco think of things she shouldn’t, like how would this man look naked.  I can’t work here, she thought, I’d end up doing my boss and that ain’t good.  “Ms. Villanueva, it’s a pleasure.  Please sit,” he said, motioning to the large overstuffed leather chair in front of his desk.  She placed her resume on his desk then sat down.  She had worn her best cream suit because it brought out her caramel coloring and flattered her curvaceous form.  Her dark long curls were wrapped in a tight professional bun showing off her long neck.  Before she walked in this office she felt as beautiful as a swan, now she felt like prey.  “Ms. Villanueva, I won’t kid you about this position, it’s very demanding.  I require more than usual from my assistants,” He paused, looking directly into her eyes and asked, “What can you offer that the others cannot?”  Coco could feel the blush creep up on her face; she’d been watching his full lips annunciate every letter of every word he spoke and didn’t believe he would turn his almond-shaped eyes up to look at her again. She was speechless, his request almost sounded sexual. Taking a moment to think about it, she decided to just be honest, besides she wasn’t getting the job anyway.  “Other than making sure you’ve bathed, there’s no particular task that I can’t do,” swallowing hard she continued, “as you can see from my resume, I type 65 – 70 words per minute, am familiar with all PC and MAC software as well as 3 different type of accounting software.  I am professional, detail oriented and very well organized.  I believe given the opportunity to work for you, I would become an essential part of your company.” Her speech delivered, she inhaled, and then exhaled.  “And?” He asked, slightly smirking.   “Umm and Mr. Kandemhan?” She replied, stumped. “Yes, Ms. Villanueva, and?  What else can you offer me? This position pays $65,000 annually plus benefits and bonuses.  I’m going to need a little more than an average glorified executive assistant; this person would be an extension of me, representing me in my absence.  So I reiterate, Ms. Villanueva, what else can you offer me?”  OH NO HE DIDN’T!! Coco thought. He did NOT just call me average! I’ll tell you what I can offer you, you damned prick, how about a little color up in this company!! You got like two black people in this building and that INCLUDES me and the janitor!! Coco couldn’t believe how much she wanted to smack this man’s hateful smirk of his gorgeous lips.  She took a deep breath then spoke.  “Mr. Kandemhan, I can do what the position requires and if there’s something I can’t do, I’ll learn.  Other than that, I don’t know what else I can offer.”  “Hhmm, I see.  Thank you, Ms. Villanueva that will be all.  Please show yourself out.” He had dismissed her.  Just like that.  Coco stood, reached over the desk and shook his soft hand, then turned and walked out of the office with her head held high.  She was too damned proud to cry until she got on the train home.  When Coco did get home she was completely taken aback to find a message from him waiting for her on her machine.  His distinctly clipped voice stating, “Congratulations Ms. Villanueva, you start Thursday.  Be sure to get in contact with the Human Resource office to fill out the necessary paperwork.”  Now here she was, two and a half years later, still working for a man who spoke to her as if she were a bad taste in his mouth he could not spit out fast enough.  But, now she’s paid $70,000 plus bonuses and as long as she was getting paid, he could talk to her as if she were the devil himself, she didn’t care.  The only thing she didn’t like was how her body responded to him when he lashed out on her.  No man should be that damned pretty.  *****************   Dee had just finished his daily power workout with Wrigley, his personal trainer.  He decided to hit the private steam room before he went back to the office to meet with Mr. Cadbury, his company’s chemist, about a project they were working on.  Although the workout was extremely rigorous, it had not squelched the seed of desire that had begun in his office.  Damn it all to HELL!  Dee thought I’m in control, no one else just me! I just have to work this thing out of my system. What he needed was a quick fix to put him back on top.  Dee looked up at a sound he heard near the entrance of the steam room and smiled.  At the door, already on all fours like a good little girl was Ginger.  She was the beautiful redhead who worked the reception area, handing out towels, t-shirts and locks to members of the exclusive gym.  Dee leaned his well-formed body against the smooth porcelain ledge of the steam room seat and sneered at her.   “Little girl, little girl, why are you here?” Dee asked in a singsong manner.  Ginger crawled forward several steps and answered in the same way, “To relish in the pain that will bring you good cheer.”  The sneer on Dee’s face turned into a radiate grin, his teeth bared in a savage manner. “Little girl, little girl, wouldn’t you want some?” Ginger closed the distance between them until finally she was kneeling between his legs, wearing nothing but an open robe and holding out a rider’s crop. “My cheer will begin when my pain makes you cum.”  His grin was now maliciously beatific; Dee grabbed the rider’s crop out of Ginger’s hand and whipped her soundly across her small pert breasts.  “Uuhh,” Ginger grunted.  And as an angry red mark welted up on her milky white skin, Dee realized that the crop had already been salted.  Perfect.   ******************  Just as Dee walked into the office building, his Blackberry went off.    ***Sir, Mr. Cadbury has arrived for your afternoon appointment, Coco***  He ran his thumb along the LCD screen over Coco’s name.  FUCK!  I thought I worked this out of my system already.  He gripped his Blackberry, erased the message and threw it in his gym bag.    As he stepped off the elevator he couldn’t resist taking a quick glance at Coco.  She sat behind the monstrous desk like a queen, regal, beautiful and dangerous.  She stared intently at her monitor as she softly chewed on the licorice whip that was hanging seductively from the corner of her lips.  It was the Ce & De brand of licorice, which she took extreme liking to and it seemed to be the only thing he ever saw her eat.  Dee stood frozen in the doorway, looking at the scene.  In an attempt to get a handle on his feelings; he gave himself, especially his erection, a mental and physical shake, and walked purposely towards her.  “Coco, has Mr. Cadbury been waiting very long?” Coco jumped.  “Oh god!  Mr. Kandemhan, I didn’t see you there.  You scared me!” she said, a little shakily.   “Hhmm, I see. Did you at least offer Mr. Cadbury some sort of refreshment?” Coco looked directly up at Dee with cool indifference. “Sir,” she said pointedly, “when have I ever left a guest unattended?”  Dee wanted to grab her delicate face and squeezed it between his fingers until she whimpered, but at that moment Mr. Cadbury decided to pop his head out of Dee’s office.   “Kandemhan! Hey buddy, you planning on keeping me waiting all day?” Mr. Cadbury’s chipper mood did nothing to break the heated tension between Dee and Coco. “We will discuss this later Coco.” “Yes sir,” she said, dismissing him as quickly as he had dismissed her.  Stepping into his office with Mr. Cadbury following him, Dee was seething.  “Cadbury, where are we on the projects?” Dee asked, barely allowing his chemist to sit down before interrogating him.  “You know, Dee, you really ought to ease up on that girl.  She’s one of the few assistants you’ve had that has lasted this long….and she’s cute to boot!!”  Dee allowed very few people to address him using his first name and Cadbury wasn’t one of them, however he was too intent on getting his hands on the projects Cadbury was working on to bother correcting him.  “Mr. Cadbury, I’d appreciate it if you let me handle my own affairs. Now, show me what you have.”  Mr. Cadbury opened the box he had brought with him and pulled out two objects.  The first was seven or so licorice whips.  However, instead of the normal seven-inch straps, these were three feet long and entirely corded with braided licorice laces. It gave the sweet, distinctively flavored root a bit more girth and weight.  The other was a special treat for Necco.  Dee had gotten it made for him knowing he would protest in Dee using it on him.    “Cadbury, you are a genius! I knew there was a reason I kept you around.” “I’m here to serve Dee, erm Kandemhan.” Cadbury quickly corrected himself when Dee threw him an abhorrent glare. “Do you have anything on the handle yet?” He asked.  “Not yet,” said Dee, “however, I will be meeting with a colleague tonight who, as we speak, has the mold for it.  This will be a masterpiece!”  Cadbury simply nodded, he really didn’t care for Kandemhan’s ‘collection’.  He had done several of these types of jobs for him in the past, however this one seemed different.  Kandemhan had been incessant about getting this ‘project’ together quickly.    Cadbury stood up, looking at his watch, “Kandemhan, if you don’t mind, I really have to get going.  Let me know when you want me to start working on the handle, okay?”  Dee, who wasn’t even listening to him, merely nodded; completely submerge in his projects.  “By the way,” Cadbury whispered, “do you happen to know if Coco’s single?”  At the mention of Coco’s name Dee looked up at Cadbury and asked, “What?” “If she’s single…a good looking woman like her may be taken, I wanted to know if you knew of any men in her life.  I’m thinking of asking her out.” Cadbury smiled at Dee, that knowing smile men give each other about women.  “You will do nothing of the sort; keep your mind on the business at hand Cadbury, not on my business!” Dee spat, so angry that anyone would dare suggest such a thing.  Cadbury quickly apologized, “Geez, Dee, erm, uhh I mean Kandemhan, I’m sorry.  I had NO IDEA you two were an item.  I would never--”  “Leave, Cadbury.  You’ve overstayed your welcome.”  Cadbury stood, openmouthed, looking at Kandemhan a moment longer then turned and walked towards the double doors.  As he was about to close the door behind him, Kandemhan threw back, “Be ready tomorrow, I will obtain the handle mold tonight.  I want this project completed by tomorrow at end of business day.” Cadbury nodded, not even looking back and silently walked out.  ****************  That was it, Coco thought, sitting at her computer simultaneously writing her resignation letter, which she was planning on sending Mr. Kandemhan via his precious Blackberry, and putting her resume out on every online job board she could find.  She could take being talked down upon but not questioning the way she did her job.  She had never given him any reason to think that she couldn’t do her duties.  Well let’s see what he thinks when he doesn’t find her here in the morning.  Coco had just finished gathering her things when the doors to Kandemhan’s office opened.  She looked up and saw Mr. Cadbury; he walked past her barely giving her a nod goodbye.  She had never seen him look so stressed before; he always seemed easygoing and good-natured.  Her boss must have said something really nasty to wipe a smile off of a nice man like that.  Anyway, she thought, not my problem anymore.  I got enough money saved and I own my apartment now, so fuck him! Coco put on her sweater and her headphones and walked out of her circular office.  As she stepped out of the building, she felt slightly dejected as if she would miss something.  It’s just the money talking, Coco laughed to herself; it’s just the money.  ***************  Dee gathered up the projects in his briefcase and picked up his gym bag as he headed out of his office.  He had to see Necco to get the template for the ‘project’.  As he walked out, he began barking orders towards Coco’s direction for the next day’s agenda when he noticed she wasn’t answering.  He looked up to see her desk was empty and immaculately ordered.  She must have left for the day, he thought.  Dee frowned; he felt unsatisfied for some reason but shook it off to think about the evening’s entertainment.  Dee stepped onto his private elevator and as the doors closed he looked one last time at Coco’s desk.  Something was amiss but he couldn’t put his finger on it.  The doors of the elevator closed leaving Dee with a foreboding feeling that nagged him long after he left the building.  ****************  Necco nervously looked through the store window again.  He’s late, thought Necco dejectedly, he probably ain’t even coming.  As he turned away from the door he heard three sharp taps on the glass.  Necco quickly turned back to see Mr. Kandemhan standing outside.  He opened the door almost relieved, “Hey Mista K., I thought, well I thought you weren’t gonna make it.”    “Don’t be ridiculous Necco, did I not say I would?” Dee smiled at Necco. “You were very good to wait my little Necco, very good.”   Necco felt his heart beat faster as Dee spoke to him.  He had never been with another man before Kandehman and technically he still hasn’t “been with a man.”  Necco wasn’t allowed to touch him but Kandehman could most definitely touch him.  He wasn’t gay or nothing but Kandehman had this way of making Necco do anything he wanted.  “Do you have it, Necco?” “U-u-hh yea, it’s in the back, this way.”  Necco lead the way to the storage area of the Pink Pussycat.  The storage room was filled with open boxes of inventory that had yet to be put away.  On a tall white table in the middle of the room, there were two kangaroo leather Cat O’ Nine whips and a molding cast for the whip’s handle.  Each Nine had a herringbone handle with about seven flat braided cats.    Dee admired the beauty of the Nines, you simply cannot get anything better than kangaroo leather, he thought.    “Are these for me, my little Necco?” “Y-yea, I thought you might like `em.” “And this is the casting mold for the handle, correct?” “Yea, of course there’s no charge Mista K., cuz, you know, we’re tight like that.” Necco was looking down; he couldn’t look Kandehman in the eyes when he called him his ‘little Necco’.  When he did; he would get a killer hard on and then he’d feel …dirty but in a good way, that kind of jeans-tight-around-the-crotch dirty but good way.   “Hhmm, indeed we are, my little Necco.  These nines are truly fine specimens.  I will have to try them out soon,” he said pointedly.  Necco got nervous; he didn’t want to be whipped today.  Not here.  He looked at Kandehman, wide-eyed as if pleading with him to understand but not verbally refusing.  “Don’t worry Necco, I’ve got something else in mind for you tonight,” he said, opening his briefcase and taking out project #2.  It was a lollipop spinner.  A battery operated machine used to spin a lollipop in a child’s mouth, except this one was slightly different.  Dee had asked Cadbury to modify the toy so that it could hold a larger stemmed pop and spin it at different levels.  The one it currently held was a large version of a Charm’s lollipop.  Dee pushed a button and the bulbous head of the pop spun around slowly.   “It’s a gift I had made for you, my little Necco.  Now what do you say?” “U-u-hh, look Mista K., I’m into electro-stimulating but not this kind.  We’ve never done anything that actually…uuhh, you know….penetrated.”  The way Dee looked down at him, Necco thought Dee would hate him and he couldn’t take it. “B-but, h-hey I’ll try anything once, three times if it feels good!” Necco joked. “That’s my good little boy,” said Dee as he reached into one of the open boxes and pulled out a small bottle of AstroGlide.   “Now, let’s see how well it works, shall we?”  ****************  An hour and a half later, Dee was back in his chauffeured car.  Project #2 was surprisingly pleasing, he’d have to thank Cadbury, he thought.  Oh hell, might as well send him a quick message.  Dee rummaged through his gym bag and retrieved his Blackberry.  There was a message from Coco, which had been sent hours ago.    ***Dear Mr. Kandehman, Due to reasons that are painfully obvious, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from this position as of today.  I wish you well. Sincerely, Coco Villanueva***  Dee anger knew no bounds; it rose rapidly up his body like a flood and crashed into him over and over.  How DARE she leave him? Well, he planned to fix this situation immediately.  “Driver, I’ve changed my mind.  Take me to 30 Bogardus Place.  It’s in the Heights.”  I refuse to let you go Coco, he thought, you’re mine.  **************  On the way to Coco’s house, Dee sent a Blackberry message to Cadbury.  He wanted him to meet him and pick up the molding cast and licorice whips and then get his final ‘project’ done this evening.  When Dee’s car pulled up to Coco’s building, Cadbury was already there. Dee handed off the items to him.  “I’d like you to deliver it here to me.” “Here?! At Coco’s place?!” “What part of my statement did you not understand Cadbury?” Cadbury sighed and nodded, “I should be done within 2 hours, give or take a few minutes, Sir.” “Very good, the apartment number is 5-A, I’ll be expecting you soon.” And with that Dee stepped into the building corridor.  He looked for her buzzer then pressed it, three sharp taps. Seconds later, her voice rose through the intercom, “Who is it?” Her voice alone incited and excited him.  “It’s Mr. Kandehman, I received your ‘letter’ of resignation and I wanted to talk to you about it, Ms. Villanueva.”  There was a long pause then she spoke again. “Okay, come up.”  The door buzzed and Dee stepped through.  The building was a renovated prewar which meant it now had elevators.  As Dee rode up he wondered what he would tell her.  His attraction for her was the main reason he hired her and was the only reason he kept her this long.  The doors opened up on the fifth floor and Dee stepped out.  He looked down the hall and saw Coco standing outside her door in a cream terrycloth robe.  “Mr. Kandehman,” she started as Dee closed the distance between them. “I was going to call you and fully explain in the morning.” “I’d prefer if we spoke in private Coco, not in the hallway of your building,” he said warmly.  Coco felt flustered; he had never spoken that way to her before.  Maybe he came to apologize, she thought. “Of course, Mr. Kandehman; please, come in.”  Inside Coco’s apartment Dee began to feel his excitement growing.  With every step he took into the pleasantly color Co-Op, he grew harder and harder.   “Mr. Kandehman, would you like something to drink?” “Why, yes thank you Coco, water will do. And please, call me Dee.” He smiled.  Coco stood absolutely still for a moment looking at him smile.  She once again got the feeling that she was being preyed upon.  His smile looked, felt and smelt dangerous. “O-of course M-Mi..umm Dee.”  Coco brought Dee water and sat opposite of him in her living room.  This was her place, she thought, he couldn’t tell her what to do here.  Dee could see several emotions passing Coco’s face. Delicious, he thought.  She may not be his employee any longer, but he planned to make her an offer he felt she would not refuse.    “Coco, I understand why you resigned, truly I do.  I’m a very difficult person to work for.”  “Well, there is that, Mr. Ka…umm Dee.  But it had a lot to do with you doubting my abilities”  Dee’s concentration was completely on the deep V of Coco’s robe.  She is very buxom isn’t she? He thought.  He’s never had buxom before, only waif.  “…and not to mention domineering!” “Hhmm what?” Dee asked. “Are you even listening to me, or are you just wasting my time? Because you can leave right now!” Coco was furious.  Not only at this man but at the way her body’s had been reacting since he arrived.    “Coco, I will not apologize for anything I’ve said or done because I don’t believe I was wrong, however, I’m willing to make you an offer I think you’d like.”  He’s probably going to offer me more money, she thought.  “I’m listening.” It infuriated him that as short as she was, she could look down at him, HIM!  “I’ll act as if you never resigned, bump your salary up to $80,000 and add 20 days vacation to your time, not to mention annual discretionary bonuses.”  Coco sat there openmouthed.  What the FUCK?! She thought; that was one hell of an apology!  “If,” Coco asked.  There had to be an ‘If’ somewhere in there, she thought. “If…” Dee said, what do I want, he thought.  I want you, Coco.  He couldn’t say that. “If you would do some things for me.”   “Like what,” Coco asked suspiciously. “Cadbury is on his way here with something I had him make.  I’d like you to be the keeper of this thing and use it when I say and on whom I say.  Can you agree to that?” “But what is it? I can’t just say yes without knowing.  What if I don’t know how to use it?” “Oh my little Coco, I’m positive that you know how to use it.” With that Dee got up and offered a hand to Coco so that she stood in front of him.  “What do you have on under this robe, my little Coco?” “I-I d-don’t understand--” “Oh, but you do,” he said as he slipped a hand beneath the robe to feel the strap of her bra that he noticed earlier.  MMmm leather, nice he thought. Coco was so excited she couldn’t breathe.  She had never in her life been topped!  She had always been the one on top, but Dee made her want to try new things.  Just then the doorbell rang.  “D-Dee,” she breathed and looked questioningly at him. “It must be Cadbury, shall we let him in?” He whispered.   Dee let Coco answer the door.  Cadbury walked in, obviously uncomfortable with the fact that he may have interrupted something.  “Ah Cadbury, good to see you again,” Dee said, grinning mischievously. “Show us what you have there.”  Cadbury’s mouth fell open then snapped shut.  He looked at Coco who looked confused but interested and decided to open the box he was carrying.  From inside, he pulled out a black and red Cat O’ Nine.  Coco walked up to get a closer look.  The entire whip was made of licorice.  Beautifully crafted for pleasure and pain.  She looked up at Dee questioningly and he smiled wickedly at her as he nodded for her to pick up the whip.  Coco grabbed the handle, it felt like the real thing, she thought, and she began to feel a hot wetness gather between her legs.  She wanted to use it, but not on Dee…on someone weak.  She looked up again at Dee, letting him know she was ready.  Dee turned his attention to Cadbury.  “Well done Cadbury, well done.  Do you mind if we give it a go?”  “Whatever rocks your socks, Kandehman.” Cadbury replied. Dee looked at Coco and watched as she lifted the whip and cracked it down across Cadbury’s clothed ass.  “WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU BITCH!! NOT ON ME!” Cadbury screamed.  Coco mirrored Dee’s smile and brought the whip down again.  “Kandehman, stop this,” Cadbury pleaded.  “Cadbury, you of all people should truly enjoy this.  I know I’ve neglected you for a time, but since you’ve been so very good; you simply must be rewarded!”   Cadbury hung his head down defeated and gave Dee a weak, “Yes sir.” Dee nodded at Coco and she stepped forward again with the whip.  “Can I make him do anything I want?” She asked sweetly, caressing the handle of the whip.    “Oh yes, my little Coco, ANYTHING you want!” Dee smiled.  ****************  “WHO?” Coco demanded as she repeatedly whipped Cadbury, “WHO CAN?”  “T-t-he Cc-candyman..c-can,” Cadbury grunted.  “WHY?” “b-b-because…” he panted, “h-he m-mixes it w-with l-love a-and makes t-the w-world taste g-good!…PLEASE STOP!” Cadbury begged and fainted away on Coco’s floor.  Coco smiled and turned.  Dee had been watching all this time and his erection looked as if it would burst out of his pants.  She walked towards him with her robe open revealing her patent leather clad lingerie and asked, “Is he right? Does the Candyman really make the world taste good?”  “That he does, my little Coco,” Dee replied as he watched Coco slip the tip on one of the licorice whips into her mouth, “that he does.”

          I currently have a livejournal where I post rants, poetry, devastations in my love life...things of that nature but what I wanted to do here was to create a place where I could begin writing my short stories and novellas.  However, I don't want every damned blogger who happens to google to read my works; I only want friends and fellow writers to read it and give their expert opinions.  So this blog will not be viewable by anyone but those I allow to view it and will not hold the typical geek rants of so many other blogs we know (and love.)  Please bare with me as I am new to blogging and am going about rearranging things to my liking (notice I did not say to YOUR liking. If you do not like how I arrange the page, please keep it to yourself.  If, however, the BLOG ITSELF isn't to your liking, then by all means tell me and make suggestions!)  I'm very excited about this. I see good things happening...such as COLLABORATIONS perhaps!  Ciao,  Eve

      Something was very wrong, Rebecca could just  feel  it.  It was too damned quiet in this house and she still couldn't find Josephine, her cat. The house, on its own, made so many sounds she didn't know if it was the cat or something else moving. All she knew is that she wanted out as soon as possible.  "JOSEPHINE...you piece of shit, spoiled DIVA....GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE!"  Rebecca's voice travelled back to her in an eerie, distorted stir of echoes that made her quickly glance to the left and right...just to make sure there was no one else there. Fuck this, Rebecca thought, I'm checking this one last room then I'm outta here!  She made her way down the dark corridor, ignoring the light rustling sounds that came to her from everywhere in the dark house. She had just reached the end of the corridor and was standing directly in front of the weirdest door she'd ever scene when she heard the whispers.    "hhheeerreee.....yoooouuuu....ooutttt"    Rebecca practically yelped...then giggled nervously...probably echoes from when she yelled earlier, after all this house has been abandoned for nearly two decades, it can create echoes like a cave.    Rebecca turned her attention back to the door.  At first glance it appeared that there was no door but upon closer inspection she saw that the door was there but it was black.  A black so deep that it made the dark in the house look brighter.  She placed a hand on the door and heard a sigh.  Rebecca looked around, startled to find that the sigh came from her.  She tentatively put her hand on the door again. A sensation that made Rebecca think of liquid heat, passed from the door to her hand then radiated down her arm and into her body.  A moan escaped her lips and as quickly as the feeling had come to her, it was gone.  Leaving her trembling against the now cool, marble-like door.    Rebecca recovered slightly then pushed the door open.  Inside the room, a rancid smell permeated almost knocking her to her knees and making her gag.   "Fuck! what is  THAT ?"   Again the whispers began. " ckkk....iiissssss....tttt "  She looked around the sparsely furnished room, trying to find the where the putrid odor was coming from.  In the corner of the room, on the floor was a water basin.  The old fashioned kind that was used to catch the perspiration off the old steam pipes back in the 40s.  Rebecca could see that there was something in it.  Something glistened in that basin, with a moist shine that almost made her want to run from the room, the house and this damned land!  But she knew she had to look, had to see what is was.  Rebecca walked to the water basin and bent to get a closer look.  There, amongst the blood, fur and other black things, was Josephine, hardly recognizable but for the powder blue collar she had bought the cat a few weeks prior.  The contents of the basin blurred as tears slid down her face.
