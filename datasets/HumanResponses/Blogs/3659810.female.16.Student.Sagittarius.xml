I just remembered about the blue moon coming up this year, i can't wait. unfortunately it is on a Monday so i can't celebrate it with my pagan friends :( Oh well maybe next time. oh that reminds me, there is this great pagan Comic strip online that everyone should read and vote for : Oh my Gods - ohmygods.timerift.net  Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      I have this.......................aquaintance and he stole my idea (talking about the best person EVER, and he isn't even agreeing with me about Twiggy being best) ARRRRRRRRG. His name is Campbell, i mean what kind of name is that anyway and he has the worst taste in SOME music, he likes listening to an artist I really really hate, which wouldn't be so bad if he didn't remark about......it... all the time. huh steal my idea will he! and he's pathetic AH,he just trashed me on his Blog. He can't even think of his own jokes, he just leaches off everyone else.  Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      (thoughtless)  "Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies  Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  I wanna see you try to take a swing at me  Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground   Why are you trying to make fun of me?  You think it's funny?  What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  You take your turn lashing out at me  I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me   All of my hate cannot be found  I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  So you can try to tear me down  Beat me to the ground  I will see you screaming"   Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      I'm in a rather poetic mood, but really i know no other. A mood where beauty is throughout my little world, in the darkness of every corner, everywhere a spider creates it's home, wonder so overwhelming tears could rise. I know better, not to show a weakness amongst this world, with it's judging ways, and it's fingers pointing directly at me. Eventually their eyes will wonder and their laughing will become no more than a horse grumble, this is the time where i will be safe in my own skin, when they choose another to judge so harshly for every mistake like they did to me. Then bliss will come, when my soul becomes so light that it chooses to drift among to clouds but it is not my place and i will soon be dragged down again where all the eyes watch me anew and the laughing is stronger than ever. &nbsp; &nbsp; Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      One thing I really hate about the holidays is that you get caught in the most annoying type of talk possible. the type of conversations where it goes somthing like this. "Hi, how are you, oh thats good, wow isn't the weather lovely today" I can't stand it. I need to have a meaningful conversation. I makes me want to smash my head againt a brick wall. Oh of all the worlds i am stuck to reality in this nightmare of a place.  To stop myself from actually smashing my head into a brick wall i've had to meditate more meaning that i'm sort of floating on air right now.   Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      I went and got my hair cut today, just a cm or 2 off the bottom. And the hair dresser was talking to my mum about how much i looked like her (yeah right, it took her about 10 mins to realise that we were related let alone that she was my mum) and then the hairdresser said "blah blah blah ....and she has such beautiful eyes" scary as hell. she could have talked about my hair but no, goes straight for the eyes.

      Last night i went to a horrorshow movie night with Jenny J at Paco's. we watched: Ghost world...... Meh The Craft.......offensive The ring.......interesting There was one other movie but we were pretty tired and went to sleep instead of watching it. Overly a funny night. Me and JennyJ wouldn't play nice and we kept kicking eachother, ok ok i kept kicking her but she kicked back. Taeghan had to ask us to play nice,i don't do 'NICE' but i waited until morning before hassling her again.   Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      "Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost"......well me actually  for today, i've been lost, hidden behind the pages of a new book. Each letter, pushing my mind into a whirlpool of thoughts, it would seem my only salvation. Confrontation seemed my downfall, i could not control either my pleasure or displeasure of talking to those who see face value (a mask) rather that the person who shows herself when they walk into the room. Very few people can actually see the real me....... you should know who you are, thanx for listening. While i hid behind "my books surcease of sorrow" i noticed something, there really are people who care for me. No matter how much i feel like their aren't, there's always someone there, sitting next to me, asking how i feel. Let this be the truth, sure there will always be days when i feel so alone and like the world is just too much for me, but you will be there, won't you, promise me this or i don't think the world would hold any value for me anymore.

      "Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;"  I didn't sleep very well last night. I'm getting an extreemly nasty cold that both of my parents have had and so they said "hey, i've got an idea, lets get Jenni sick so she can be miserable". The sad thing is, i'm sure that they are going to make me go to school tomorrow, it's like they try and make me feel like crap. Parents suck   Rhedyn "Nevermore"

       One asks:  Where did you go?  One asks:  Why did you leave?  One says:  I hope you never return!  One asks:  Why would I care?        Where did you go?  You went away .Ever since, my mind has been exploding with a unique jealousy, wondering in which mind you now take up shelter.  Why did you leave?  I needed you, but I never showed it, is this why you left me with the others? you were one I could always stand to have in my head, but I got bored of you easily It would seem. You helped me a lot with my unimportant crap, things that I thought I couldn't tell anyone, and I couldn't but you knew.  I hope you never return!  When you saw the fountain of youth you said you cared, and this would seem true but what of when my eyes were shut, were your thoughts always so comforting, this I have always doubted. You left when I thought we were the closest we'd ever been. You resented me, didn't you?  Why would I care?  You were part of me for a while, like my child. Letting you go was the most difficult decision I ever had to make, but it was for my sanity, for my well being and for those around me. I can't be the person you made me, forever.    One says:  I hate you too much  One asks:  will you be there for me ever again?  One says:  I miss you too much   All the others just glare.          ....confused? i hope so     Rhedyn   "Nevermore"

      This is the worst week of my life. today i was told that i have to do my speech again and for those who know me, they know that i can't handle speeches, once a year is way to much. I told Mr Wilson that i just couldn't do it but he kept pushing me and i almost cried (again) but i held it in, i'm sure he could see this but all he did was say that if i didn't agree to do it he was going to call my parents and make them make me do it, but i heldthe tears in. After school, my mum was there to pick me up and the tears i had been holding in just ran down my cheek. I told her about having to do my speech again, and since she could see i was upset, she said that it didn't matter if Mr Wilson was going to call, she would just tell him that I have always had problems with speeches and she couldn't make me do it, if i didn't want to..... The worst week of my life  3 out of 3 days i've cried 2 out of 3 days i've let people see it 3 out of 3 days i've been depressed 1 out of 3 days i took Laura's "don't worry you'll die one day" speech seriously and smiled at the thought  i hate feeling this way  Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      "Will you walk me, To the edge again? Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again Woke up tonight and no one's here with me I'm giving in"  I've had enough. I hate people so much that i can't stand it. All through Badminton there was atleast one tear rolling down my cheak, i had to show myself to erin and Jenny, i had to show  myself being so very weak. What happened? people did, people who think they are sooo much better than me just because i'm different, just because i believe in different things, just because i questioned life, i questioned what most people around me take for granted. They got what they wanted, they made me feel like crap, they made me cry, they made me question where the nearest bridge is.....   Rhedyn "Nevermore"

      Something i was wondering on the way home today, If i was just like everyone else, would any of my favourite people notice me, talk to me...... i can't imagine they would, maybe that is why i strive to be different because i know that being like everyone else means being cast out by those who say they care about me. In class last term we talked about how those who don't conform get cast out, for me it is the opposite, if i were to conform i could kiss my 'friends' goodbye. I would be so very alone in this world, i would never get invited anywhere, never would i feel needed... hmmm sounds like my life now.... maybe it wouldn't be such a change after all, maybe for me conforming is just another choice that leads to the same outcome.

      This song (by APC for all you unknowing people) seems to show what i feel today. sorta floating on air, sorta detatched, sorta bored and sorta like i'm fading into the background. I don't even know why i feel like this, its not like anyone really ignored me today, maybe i just need alot of attention like a puppy.... hmm i don't like that...... dead puppy? i can't really imagine how much attention a dead puppy needs..... how about just an evil puppy.... hmmm.. something still doesn't fit..... i'm an evil puppy with fireball eyes.... and....and.... a wagging tail of doom... okay....maybe I need alot of attention like an evil puppy with fireball eyes and a wagging tail of doom.

      I've been listening to this song called 'Something more' and it makes so much sence to me. Do you know the feeling of finding a song or a phrase which completely convays what you think?  "And I believe there's something more 'Cause this isn't what I've been looking for And if I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it This makes no sense A mirage of an oasis And it kills my time"  Alittle solumn maybe, but i always feel that way.

      This morning was...... different. I woke up with a smile on my face, for the time in ages. I even noticed a spring in my step when i walked to Chartwell, I seem to be happy, which is really odd since I have speeches tomorrow. Oh great now i feel sick, i hate speaking in public, i'm sure it will go away eventually, ow   Rhedyn "Nevermore"
