      More people are killed by pigs or falling coconuts than shark attacks.   The Bible has been translated into Klingon.   On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year.   Internationally, Baywatch is the most popular TV show in history.

      Women Are Like Apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy......   So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree.   Share this with other women who are good apples, even those who have already been picked.   As for men...   Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the heck out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

      An Italian, a Scotsman and a Chinese fellow are hired at a construction site. The foreman points out a huge pile of sand and says to the Italian guy, "You're in charge of sweeping." To the Scotsman he says, "You're in charge of shoveling." And to the Chinese guy, "You're in charge of supplies." He then says, "Now, I have to leave for a little while. I expect you guys to make a big dent in that pile." So the foreman went away for a couple hours and when he returns, the pile of sand is untouched. He asks the Italian, "Why didn't you sweep any of it?"  The Italian replies, "I no hava no broom. You saida to the Chinese fella that he awasa in a charge of supplies, but he hasa disappeared and I nocouldafinda him nowhere!" Then the foreman turns to the Scotsman and says, And you, I thought I told you to shovel this pile?" The Scotsman replies, "Aye, ye did lad, boot ah could nay get me self a  shoovel! Ye left the Chinese guy in chairge of supplies, boot ahcouldnay fin' him either." The foreman is really angry now and storms off toward the pile of sand to look for the Chinese guy. Just then, the Chinese guy leaps out from behind the pile of sand and yells "SUPPLIES"!   My apoligies to anyone who is offended by this joke! i assure you it it just a joke and not ment to be taken in any racisist manner!

I brought the child into the world with pain and labor. She should be in my custody."  >  >  >The judge turns to the husband and says: "What do you have to say in Your defence?"  >  >  >The man sat for a while contemplating.. then slowly rose: "Your Honor. If I put a dollar in a vending machine and a Pepsi comes out.. whose Pepsi is it .. the machine's or mine?"   I do not agree with this but it is quite funny!! so laugh it up!!

      An office manager was given the task of hiring an individual to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask  them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table the interviewer asked, "What is the fastest thing you know of?"Acknowledging the first man on his right, the man replied, A THOUGHT. It just pops into your head. There's no warning that it's on the  way; it's just there. A thought is the fastest thing I know of." "That'svery good!" replied the interviewer.  "And now you sir?" he asked the second man. "Hmm....let me see. A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of." "Excellent!" said the interviewer."The blink of an eye... that's a very popular cliche for speed."  He then turned to the third man who was contemplating his reply."Well,out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light in the barn comes on in less than an instant. Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of." The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. "It's hard to beat the speed  of light" he said. Turning to the fourth and final man, the  interviewer posed the same question. The last man replied, "After hearing the three previous answers,  it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA." "WHAT!?"said the interviewer, stunned by the response. "Oh I can explain." said the fourth man. "You see the other day I wasn't feeling so good and I ran for the bathroom. But, before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE  LIGHT, I had already shit my pants!" HE GOT THE JOB!!

      A guy was ordered by his doctor to lose 75 lbs. due to very serious health risks.As he wondered how in the heck he would ever do it, he saw an ad in the newspaper for a GUARANTEED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. "Guaranteed? Yeah right!" he thought to himself. But desperate, he calls them up and subscribes to the 3-day/10 pound weight loss program. The next day there's a knock at his door, and when he answers, there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19-year-old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign round her neck. She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, "If you can catch me, you can have me." Without a second thought he takes off after  her. A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has his way with her. After they are through and she leaves, he thinks to himself, "I like the way this company does business!" The same girl shows up for the next two days and the same thing happens. On the fourth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 10 lb. as promised. He calls the company and orders their 5-day/20  pound program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life, wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, "If you catch me, you can have me." He's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and it takes him a while to catch her, but when he does, it is worth every cramp and wheeze. For the next four days, the same routine happens and much to his delight, on the fifth day he weighs himself and found he has lost another 20 lbs. as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/50 pound program. "Are you sure?", asks the representative on the phone. "This is our most rigorous program." "Absolutely," he replies, "I haven't felt this good in years." The next day there's a knock at the door and when he opens it he finds Richard Simmons standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, "If I catch you, you're mine!

I'll never fall in line    Become another victim of your conformity    And back down.     &nbsp;   Because you don't    Know us at all we laugh when old people fall.    But what would you expect with a conscience so small.    Heavy metal and mullets it's how we were raised.    Maiden and priest were the gods that we praised     &nbsp;   Cause we like having fun at other peoples expense and,    Cutting people down is just a minor offence then,    It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn.    I'm sick of being told to wait my turn.     &nbsp;   I don't want to waste my time    become another casualty of society.

      Ibiza  Sure, the beaches are alluring. The water sports are a draw. But the reason Spain's exotic isle is your fantasy island is the social life, baby! For a fun and party-loving soul like you, vacations are all about letting your hair down, blowing off steam, and indulging your wild side. It's a buzz you're after, whether you find it jamming on a dance floor, hopping from bar to bar, or just enjoying the vitality and excitement of the city, Ibiza's clubs, casinos, and promenades have got you covered.  People, parties, crowds — either joining in or just watching, you thrive on feeling part of an energetic social scene. Like easy-going Ibiza, you're a free spirit who loves to take in every moment, especially when vacationing. Party on!

       CURRENT SONG PLAYING:Sum 41-Motivation    &nbsp;  LYRICS   Motivation"What's the difference of never knowing at all?   When every step I take is always too small.   Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,   I feel like I don't give a shit.   &nbsp;   Motivation such an aggravation,   Accusations don't know how to take them.   Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.   Concentration's never hard to break it.   Situation never what you want it to be.    &nbsp;  What's the point of never making mistakes?   Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break.   It's all just a waste of time in the end.   I don't care so why should I even pretend.    &nbsp;  Motivation such an aggravation,   Accusations don't know how to take them.   Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.   Concentration's never hard to break it.   Situation never what you want it.    &nbsp;  Nothing's new, everything's the same.   It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame.   I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain.   No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind.    &nbsp;  Can't depend on doubt until the end.   It seems like leaving friends has become   This years trend and though I can't pretend.   It's fine to be mislead.    It's not the same but who's to blame,    For all those stupid things I never said.     &nbsp;  Motivation such an aggravation,   Accusations don't know how to take them.   Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.   Concentration's never hard to break it.    &nbsp;  Motivation such an aggravation,   Accusations don't know how to take them.   Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.   Concentration's never hard to break it.   Situation never what you want it to be.    &nbsp;  Never what you want it to be.

      Have you ever made the mistake  Of wanting to believe someone so much  That you are blinded by their lies?  Despite all the evidence...  They are able to look deeply into your eyes...  and lie.  You wanted to be in love  With someone you could trust.  After all, loyalty is a must  When you're in love.  Even when something just doesn't feel right...  And you lie awake, thinking about it all night...  Still...you want so hard to believe  Although the evidence is there.  The day finally comes  When you see the light...  You feel like a fool,   Once you gain new sight  Realizing...  You fell victim  To a web of deceit.     witchbladeXX

      "All our young lives we search for someone to love, someone who makes us complete. We choose partners and change partners. We dance to a song of heartbreak and hope, all the while wondering if somewhere and somehow there is someone searching for us." -The Wonder Years  "The basic difference between an ordinary person and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge while an ordinary person takes everything as a blessing or a curse." -Carlos Castaneda  "If I have seenn farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier seashell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered for me." -Isaac Newton   "When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute -- and it's longer than any hour. That's relativity." -Albert Einstein  True friends stab you in the front -Winston Churchill  The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of your three best friends. If they're okay, then it's you. -Rita Mae Brown   Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so. -Douglas Adams  College is nothing more than a "period of training in techniques for dealing with boredom." -Mike Stone on Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami (translation by Jay Rubin)  "My mother never saw the irony in calling me a son-of-a-bitch." -Jack Nicholson  "I love the dumb blonde image. Then I have nothing to live up to." -Pamela Anderson Lee  Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very very good; and when it is bad, it is better than nothing. -Dick Brandon  Either that girl is flirting with me, or my paranoia is finally trying to do something positive -Brad Yung, 1998

      ...I would like to beg you dear Sir, as well as I can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.  Rainer Maria Rilke, 1903  in Letters to a Young Poet

Every time you look at me my back is facing you,  And every time you ask to see me I'll have something else to do.

You see the anger that burns from her gaze, The madness that sets her eyes ablaze, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the fear that closes her eyes, The smile she wears is but a disguise, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the hope that is finally dead, She cannot trust for her heart has been bled, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see the love that lies within, But she shall never love again, She won't cry. No, she won't cry.  You see death's hand that has glazed her eyes, No one saw her die inside, They won't cry. No, they won't cry.

Fingers touch to find my way, Each foot fall, my heart betrays The fear which drives me through the day.  Suddenly the ground is lost, Flailing arms as body's tossed. Splashing down in crimson pool, The warm embrace is much too cruel, I curse this lowly, wretched fool.  Floundering in this self made hell, Warmth increasing as I dwell, Within the confines I create, Screaming as myself berate, Giving in to this, my fate.

It's not that I don't love you...I just can't trust... So I gained control... using endearment and lust. I cause you such pain and anguish, the same I protect myself from... Unknowing how anger has made me become. A little girl's trauma unleashed a mighty wrath... Into the body of a woman walking on a vengeful path. You've tasted my poison and fell under my spell... Cursed with deceit, when in love with me you fell.   written by: witchbladeXX

       CURRENT SONG PLAYING:Switchfoot-Gone    &nbsp;  LYRICS   she told him she'd rather fix her makeup   than try to fix what's going on   but the problem keeps on calling even with the cellphone gone   she told him that she believes in living bigger than she's living now   but her world keeps spinning backwards and upsidedown   don't say so long, and throw yourself wrong   don't spend today away   cuz today will soon be     &nbsp;  gone, like yesterday is gone,    like history is   gone, just trying to prove me wrong    and pretend like you're immortal    &nbsp;  she said he said live like no tomorrow   every day we borrow   brings us one step closer to the edge (infinity)   where's your treasure, where's your hope   if you get the world and lose your soul   she pretends like she pretends like she's immortal   don't say so long   you're not that far gone   this could be your big chance to makeup   today will soon be    &nbsp;  gone, like yeterday is gone,    like history is    gone,the world keeps spinning on,   your going going gone, like summer break is gone,   like saturday is gone   just trying to prove me wrong    you pretend like your immortal your immortal    &nbsp;  we are not infinite    we are not permanent   nothing is immediate   we're so confident    in our accomplishments   look at our decadence    &nbsp;  gone, like Frank Sinatralike    Elvis and his mom   like AL Pacino's cash    nothing lasts in this life   my highschool dreams are gone   my childhood sweets are gone   life is a day that doesn't last for long    &nbsp;  life is more than money   &nbsp;time was never money   time was never cash,   life is still more than girls    life is more than hundred dollar bills   and roto-tom fills   life's more than fame and rock and roll and thrills   all the riches of the king   send up in wills we got information in the information age   but do we know what life is    outside of our convenient Lexus cages    &nbsp;  she said he said live like no tomorrow    every moment that we borrow   brings us closer to the God who's not short of cash    hey Bono i'm glad you asked   life is still worth living, life is still worth living  &nbsp;  lyrics copied from azlyrics.com

      You cause me so much grief, your trying to hard!  I told you no but you wont except it,  I let you in as far as I could but you kept trying to get farther!  Am I suppose to give up all my beliefs just because you think your in love?  Have my thoughts and emotions meant nothing to you?  You call and I become upset, why would you want me to feel like a bitch!  Why do you wish for me to feel like I've done something wrong!   I don't think I led you on I don't think I lied or said I wanted more I told you it could not  be  Why do you keep pushing for something that doesn't exist!  I told you we were friends that's all we can be,  I gave you warnings, if you kept pushing, id give you up! I'm not afraid of letting you go! But I'm afraid that I've done something wrong to make you feel for me so I keep dangling you there  You keep climbing the rope,  I'm sorry but its time for me to let the rope fall and For you to jump to another rope another person that will pull you up,  We are done you can delete my number I want you no more,  Don't call me while your drunk don't call me after you've done some drugs!  There's nothing left for me to fight for with you,  Your to stubborn to except the fact that I just don't have the same feelings for you,  I'm deleting everything so I can only hope you'll do the same Your name will not exist just leave me to my self,  As I have told you before that's only way I know!!                                                              -just another memory-                                   ~crystal~

      hey all!  well ive had alot on my mind as you probl. gathered from from the last post and.... it just seems like i keep on getting more to add to it! more arguments, more of Mr. perfect saying just the right thing so i just want to kiss him! and more drama that friends pile on me and expect me to some how solve all there promblems by just saying the right words, and some how even if im having the worst day i some how manage to fake my tears and turn my dramatic friends from being confused into being happy again! i wish it was just that easy for me but unfurtinally my friends crys will always be more important then mine, i wont have it any other way! maybey thats why i always seem to cause somthing to go wrong with my family, cause i let everything add up. i dont know just another one of my idea's of why and how come! but either which way, the fact still remains, that me and my family are going different directions and im just another pshychiatrist for my friends! Ill just keep taking it all in, letting it all soak up! im sure it will all blow up in my face someday but for now it seems like everybody else is just better off with me keeping my mouth shut about my feelings!

      hey all, im doing it agiain, im agonizing over everything, im asking questions to myself and searching for the answer, the answers that i still cant find, im crying over everything! Im breaking down Again! i feel like taking to many pills, and letting my self slowly drift away, and go to a place that im not even sure excist anymore. Hell? The Devil? Heavan? The almighty GOD? I want to believe in somthing bigger, somthing watching over all the evils in the world and knowing even though everything is going to hell right now it will all be good in the end! but some how i cant! i cant get back to that girl that everyone loved and was always happy, really happy, not the fake happiness that i put on for everyone and no one sees through, the real happy girl! i want to be her again, i want to let everyone in to my world i want to take the chance of getting hurt but feel the happiness of loving them while you have them! i want to tell everyone all the secrets i keep to my self! and there i go again asking questions and coming with conclusions that cant be answered and wanting whats impossible to have! I want those pills right now, it be so easy to just fade away, to leave this world of sorrow, to have no worry no pain, no shield to protect your self with! and when ive faded away i want to complete it by becoming dust and i want my dust to be throwin at night into the frio river! i want to have no evidence of my living! but when it trully comes down to it i cant do it ive been at that pnt and have had the pills in my hands atleast twice but im to weak, i strive to be emotionally strong to never show it! but i still digust my self with my weakness's!                               -crystal-

       wow...summer is such a short lived period of time, monday i go to get my books and junk! and i need to call windfern and find out what schedule i could have!         im pretty much sick of school, which if you would have asked me a year ago, i would have thought i could never get tired of it but here i em a year later sick and tired of the drama that use to consist of me! the stupid clicks, the imature boyfriend and girlfreind promblems! "oh crystal i cant believe he cheated on me im so stupid to think i was in love" "no shit you were stupid! did you really think you would make love and then he would want to marry you and yall would live happy ever after!?! yeah well life just dosent happen that way" and the classic "omg i really like him but how do i tell him/her? does he/she like me? is he/she to good for me?" "damn is it really that comlicated just go fuckin ask? stop obbsessing"  you stupid people should all do me a favor next time you have a crush, next time you think your i love (the 50th time this year) next time they brake your heart, next time they cheat, dont tell me, dont come running to me for advice! yeah come to me when your dad hits you, or when you get raped,  you start getting obsessed with drugs, you start drinking every night, when you think your pregnant, or when you end up in the hospital, call for my help and sympathy then and only then!  haha the funy thing is i have such this strong feeling, but i could never acutally tell my friends this! its just a feeling granted it is stupid shit and i dont really care i need to be there for my freinds! hey like they say what is done now will come back to repay you! now if its a good or bad pay back that up to us!         suppose to go to astroworld agian today but decided to go tommorow instead, my sister-in-law said we should just start living there we go so much! well that about all for today! i cleaned the house swept the front walk way cleaned the door swept the front hall and got no reconition as usuall! it sucks but nothin seems to change in this house!

       woke up this morning&nbsp;not quite sure what to do today, i think im gonna go excersise and maybey go tan, i have a great tan right now but i have a permanent bathing suit on! lol so i need to tan nude! i keep procastinating but there wont be to many more oppurtunities to just lay out in the sun after school starts!&nbsp;    &nbsp;  ofcourse my sister told amanda (sis in law) everything that happend tuesday, which i dont really care anymore! my sister-in-law just asked question's, one question i just kinda been thinking about is her&nbsp;question "what would other people think about the way you dont give a shit about anything and your willing to just give your body to someone with out even really loving them"&nbsp; "are you gonna care if people start to find&nbsp;out and they start to talk?"&nbsp;(not in those&nbsp;exact&nbsp;words) and yeah i guess i kinda do care what everybody thinks but in another way it dosent matter anymore. ive been&nbsp;known as&nbsp;a slut since middle school, expecially in 9th grade&nbsp;and i hadnt even done anything sexual back then, hell even my brothers and bro's girl friends had bets on when i was going to first fuck someone, haha i still think thats funny! but&nbsp;if&nbsp;people would &nbsp;actually&nbsp;get to know me and see that im anything&nbsp;of the sort and my friends yeah they might be sluts, flirts, etc...but does it really make them a bad person cause they enjoy having sex or getting attention? they would relize there great people! but i assume its easier for people to imagine that everybodys who does it or hang's out with the people who do there automatically sluts, its easier to explain that "shes a slut" then to have all the questions of "why would she be hanging out with them if she wasnt"&nbsp;or "why would she do that?" ect... im not going to go run around and tell everybody my buisness, and my sex life,&nbsp;there's certian things that should just be kept to yourself&nbsp;but if im out having fun and someone see's, i guess i just woulnt give a shit, they would have there precious proof that im what everyone wants to believe! like my sister-n-law said if im comftorable with what i do, then who cares what anyone else thinks! everyones entitled to there own opinion! maybey im just trying to justify my actions! but if anyone would like to comment on my thoughts! i would love to hear you opinion!

Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own?    I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blown    Oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone     &nbsp;   Hey, give me space so I can breathe    Give me space so I can sleep    Give me space so you can drown in this with me     In this place    The lonely escapade in outer space    There's no antidote for irony you say    that you have, when you know that you don't    and you say, that you can, when you know that you won't     &nbsp;   Hey, give me space so I can breathe    Give me space so I can sleep    Give me space so you can drown in this with me    Hey, give me space but I can't breathe    Give me space but I can't sleep    Give me just one inch I swear that's all I'll need     &nbsp;   These padded walls and TV screens    Sometimes they make me want to scream     &nbsp;   Hey, give me space so I can breathe    Give me space so I can sleep    Give me space so you can drown in this with me    Hey, give me space but I can't breathe    Give me space but I can't sleep    Give me just one inch I swear that's all I'll need     Lyrics copied from azlyrics.com!

(shit im gettin corny ill&nbsp;shut up now)&nbsp;so he wanted to go on the kiddy slide we went and i relized he got a whole in&nbsp;the back of his pants so small but still, he was soo pissed, it was kinda funny,&nbsp;then we went to this thing you&nbsp;have to cross the water with out fallin untell you get to the&nbsp;end, shit&nbsp;i knew i coulnt do it so i told him id watch! &nbsp;he made it all the way across,&nbsp;told him he was a&nbsp;fuckin show off, he said he trys!&nbsp;i went and got my sisters money and got somthing to drink we&nbsp;shared, tanned talked etc... my sis came and left again we went to the wave pool, he was all up on me i seriously wanted to fuck&nbsp;him,&nbsp;he put my legs around him, i dont need to get into much detail, it was just very sexuall, he was gettin too worked up&nbsp;i had to let him go&nbsp;cool down! haha &nbsp;it was so sexy he just kept hold&nbsp;on to my waist holding on&nbsp;to me and staring at me with those eyes! kept telling me to stop doing&nbsp;certian things cause it was making him&nbsp;horny! haha it was just fun we&nbsp;started going to the roller coasters around 6,&nbsp;he told me no flirting in front of my sis and wes cause he dint want them to know, he dint want all the question's like &nbsp;"did you fuck her?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;he said "im a pimp, what i do is my buisness" i laughed but i told him they dint care my sis has tryed to hook up with guys who just wanted to fuck before she dosent care! but whatever he kept going behind there back and grabbing me and shit my sis and wes caught him a few times so i played the hard to get shit cause he was makin such a big deal about not wanting them to no so i told him "he coulnt touch, they might see" hes all like "come on baby!"&nbsp;&nbsp;i told him "but they might see then what would we do, this is my space make sure you dont enter it" he gave me that look and said fine but about 2 minutes later he was all over me again! if they went to the front of the ride we went to the back etc... we just kept fuckin around everytime we had a chance, finally wes and him talked and told him he dosent give a shit so&nbsp;we dint have to hide as much but still kinda&nbsp;weird with your sis and his best friend watching lol &nbsp;it was a blast we road the sky ride twice once with my sis and wes to get to the entrance to leave but we went the wrong way and ended up in the middle again&nbsp;and wes said get the cell phones they will go one way we will go the other, so me and him decided to ride the ski thing and get ahead, we were defently not paying attention to the view! he wa aggresive but it would have been better if he would have been just a tad bit more aggressive! but i had my fun so im happy! we got lost trying to find hooters but eventually got there, hooters is not just for the girls the food is great too! haha! and that was about it almost fell asleep in his lap on the way home&nbsp;but woulnt let myself he told&nbsp;me if i wanted to do" somthing" &nbsp;tommorow call him he's leaving thursday morning, and i might&nbsp;have called him if i hadnt found out that the reason he woulnt go any farther then what he was is becuase his girlfriend i wasnt upset about it at all i just wish he would have told me and if he cares that much about his girlfirend i dont want to get in the way of there relationship! im glad hes leaving and i probl. wont see him again cause i know how easy i could fall for him and its hard for me to fall for anbody so thats saying alot!     &nbsp;  which is really odd being hes everything i dispise, the 18 year old that's going to college and mommy still buys everything for him, he shops at abercrombie & fitch and his mom just bought him a new truck!&nbsp;hes everything that im not and some how he got my attention, but im not saying if he ever comes back in town we cant have a fling im completly open to that idea! haha!   &nbsp;   well im&nbsp;gonna go&nbsp;finish&nbsp;re arranging my room!&nbsp;ill write more when i got somthing else intresting to talk&nbsp;about! laterz   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -crystal- &nbsp;

       I decided to write the&nbsp;pevious post cause i was&nbsp;thinking of mistakes that ive made, the reasons, etc...&nbsp;and wanted to get them out without going into to much&nbsp;detail, for some odd reason i feel a little better getting&nbsp;these feelings that have&nbsp;been collecting dust out of me! for some very weird reason everytime i write in here, with somthing important to me i feel better some how! (i know im weird, lets not remind me lol) well anyways i got it out by writing some&nbsp;horrible poem that just popped in my head, its defintley not beautifull or anything but i know im not a poet or anything so i dont really care if its not good! &nbsp;    well&nbsp;we went to johnny carinos today&nbsp;(one of my favorite&nbsp;resturants) for my moms Birthday its tommorow but we decided to go out to eat today! i ordered the low fat lemon rosemary chicken!! its was good, like everything ive tried there! but the low fat part was ruined because of the desert, it was good but i really need to stop eating so much junk food, not that im saying im fat, which everyone assumes im implying&nbsp;when i say that, but its not cause i think im fat its simply because im unhealty, and i want to get in a habit of eating healthy and excercising! its as simple as that! it really irriatates me that my family forces me to eat food that i dont want to, they know im trying to get into a healthy habit but i guess they just assume im just trying to lose wait! grr... there so stubborn! hmm... well me and my sister are planning on going to astroworld tuesday....not sure if we will but we want to go 2 in 2, she asked "who are you going to bring?" my reply "good question" lol its not the promblem of who i can bring, i can think of alot of people to go with, but the question is who would i have fun with?!&nbsp;so i asked my sister if she had any friends she wanted to bring so she mentioned jerry...to update&nbsp;you, jerry is a guy that i ment&nbsp;twice once last&nbsp;year we stopped by&nbsp;his house for like 10 minutes to say hi to my sisters best friend&nbsp; (greg) also&nbsp;known as my unrelated&nbsp;brother, and the second time was i think last week we went over to gregs house&nbsp;and my sister&nbsp;basically dropped my off with greg, jerry and justin (justin was&nbsp;1 of my ex crushes/and i was one of his, and we might be together at this moment if either of us had known we liked each other at the same time) my sis went with dontae's to his&nbsp;house for whatever reason and me and jerry kept me occupied by making conversation with me and&nbsp; he kept staring at me (a bit odd but whatever) and we&nbsp;just kept&nbsp;laughin&nbsp;and ofcourse he kept saying shit to impress me (guys just to let you know its annoying, dont try to impress, just be yourself seriously!!)&nbsp;and&nbsp;doin all that flirty shit but it was cute! but yeah i dont know i dont really want it to be a first date thing... were its like the flirting and the whole get to know you conversation, but i might take my sister up on that idea, might be good for me,&nbsp;kinda get me moving past my previous&nbsp;dilema with endrew..whom if youd read this blog&nbsp;from the beggining you would have read about but ive deleted his post since then, i think i might give it a&nbsp;try, i guess ill just&nbsp;see what happen's!&nbsp;

      what happens when the one person in the world that you love, you cant be with, what do you do? do you move on and just assume it wasnt ment to be, while you wonder what it would be like if you would have persude somthing? what do you do? if you cant take a chance cause your afraid of the pain and you know the one you love is just another heart breaker do you take the chance and love him while it last and cry for days when it ends, what if you cant stand the pain, what if you cant take the chance, but you know if he ever came up to you and pushed you to the ground and started making love to you, you would let him? how do you resist or how do you try to persue somthing, what if your stuck in the middle were it seems like youve been for years? do you finally make a choice and stick with it even if it could be the worst choice you ever made? how do you know what to do when everything seems to be falling down if front of you and you just want to cry? what do i do im lost and i dont know which way im suppose to turn? how em i suppose to figure this out alone?

      wow!! the birth of a baby, how can one ever explain the experiece!?! all i can really say is its amazing! everyday theres someone who dies and they cover the news with depressing storys, and although ill admitt there is so many horrible things in the world, but they never have a story about an amazing survival of a baby that they dint have a chance of living, who has! you dont see people going to interview the mothers who just had there first child or hear about the survival story of someone who just went through a amazing surgery...its almost like the world wants us to be depressed! ofcourse the mother goes through pain but to only the extient of having a beatifull baby! my advice to anyone who has a promblem with gory things and has the oppurtunity to see the birth of a child, is just to not think about it, cause when that child comes out you wont want to miss it just cause you think your going to get to qeezy! babys are the one thing that are most pure and truthfull in the world and to see him take his first breath and hear him scream is so beautifull! well im goign to stop rambling on about babys! im publishing some pictures of the baby in my picture journal so check it out!                             -crystal-

       hey all  as usuall, i got tons of thoughts runing around in my head and i just need some were to get them out! soo if you can possibly even understand a single word i speek...im wanting somthing that i dont really want! I want the one thing that i despise the most love!.. the thought of never wanting to be apart and spending all your time with the one! even if only lasting for what seems like a single moment! i want it! but i dont cause i know it dosent exist! i guess it goes with the whole saying you want what you cant have! but even when i go through my stages were this thought pops in my head "hey mayby i should give him a chance, maybey i should stop being scared of the ending and look forward to all the sappy cute shit, maybey it will work out" and i do that and i either give up just at the beggining or i tell them not to expect anything, and i dont want something i just want it to go however it goes, but some how i seem to hurt them more i dont know! i just rather stay away from anyone who might want any relationship with me, im just been thinking about a convorsation i had with a good friend talking about his need for always needing to love and be loved and my constant strive to push anything i love or loves away, and im thinking about some one else that i ended it with and thinking how scrued up i am.. and knowing that i scrued everything up and sometimes i wished i hadnt but i know ill just keep doing the same thing! scruing it all up, running back to him, having the heavy burden of his feelings on my shoulders...wondering, i gave it a chance it would have worked then if it was suppose too! i always come to these questions wondering if its really worth never loving or love then the hurt? and wishing i could be like these people! and ill always have 2 views 2 feelings fighting for the final say, and in this issue i have to keep my origanial opinion that love is nothing but a fantasy! and to satisfy my other thoughts of love being true, ill go to sleep to night and ill dream! i guess basically im just worried and this misterious person whom i care for but just cant talk to happens to read this i want you to know what i coulnt call you and tell you, all of this, and im sorry and i love you, but unfortuanlly not enough to risk everything, all my beliefs on somthing that woulnt last some fantasy of mine! well thats all of my mood of wondering wondering and thinking way to much, this is just another one of the many written down thoughts of this issue and theres sure to be more, but i am tired i dint sleep much last night! so i think im going to go fall asleep in a big comfie blanket watching some corny draculla movie!                            -crystal-

      wow it has been one long day! ill just get to the point! last nite, i went to bed at like 2:00 and i kept wakeing up, to what i thought was telamarciters, and they kept calling on my parents line and my sisters line so finally my mom got pissed picked up the phone and relized it was the county jail she tryed to except the call but somthing messed up so she put the phone next to her and layed back down and i grabbed my sisters phone soo i could pick up  if they called again..and that was at 3 somthin and i stayed up for about an hour thinking it was greg (a close friend of the familys) or timmy and travis (my cousins whom always seem to end up in jail) or my brother... something like that, when i finally went back to sleep they called abut 5 somthin and it ended up bein  one of my sisters spoiled friends... and she has been doin drugs constanly every weekend...or going to some party gettin drunk and driven home so it was kinda expected! and not that i think its good that she got caught i just think she deserved it cause she has the attitude she wont get caught and dosent think about all the risk!..shes not even a citizen of the USA soo they could technically kick her out,i mean if she was a citizen it would be a totally diff. story i would just kinda be like dumb ass got caught but she just dosent! but anyways she has this new friend that shes been hanging out with and she talks amanah in to doing what ever she wants, she basically uses her cause she has a car but yeah... a cop pulled her over for a broken tail light and smelled weed that amnah friend and some other peeps had to smoke right then.. coulnt wait tell they got home! soo only arrested amnah for it! and she was calling my sis cause she needed her to call her friend and see if she was coming to get her..which her firend dint have enough money for gas so how the hell she thought she was going to bail her, i dont know?,  but yeah she coulnt tell her dad cause hes going to send her back east if he finds out anything bad about her so she was trying to get bail before she had to be back home! but not sure whats happend now cause we went to astroworld for the day finally got back around 10:30 ish and when we got back my sis tryed getting ahold of her but dosent know were she is? so yeah thats that! intresting huh! im stil pissed cause i dint get my sleep lol j/k but overall i had a blast at astroworld! well thats all for now if i have something intresting or just have some burst of thought that i need to talk about ill write more then...but for now love yah all!                          -crystal-
