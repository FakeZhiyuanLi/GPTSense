						   ok what the hell is wrong with u when u r a geek and yet u can't help but have feelings for some1 totallyout of ur league? u see i really like alex but tasha likes him and britt likes him and alyssa likes him. all of which are far cooler than me so if ne one's out there give me one reason y alex would want to be more than just friends.

						   does your boyfriend or girlfriend do something you hate? did you just get dumped in a really crappy way? do you have any thing to complain about when it comes to b/fs and g/fs? if u answer any of these question with a yes than i wanna hear about it.

						   i dont know if its me but it seems like whenever i don't see alex i really dont care. i start to think that there's no reason to actualy like him. i start to think that there's others like adrian or conor or someone else. but when i do see him its completely different i feel like there's noone else. but of course im just being stupid and tired.

						   it is so annoying b-ing me. at least evry1 else my age has one good thing in there life. bayfriends. to be perfectly honest i have had only one boyfriendin my lifetime. and even that only lasted 2 hours. i know i said that i've had more but i lied. mostly b-cause sandra and them were making fun of me cause of it. what is true tho is evrything else. and if ne of my friends read this ever im srry for lying its just the rest of u are so lucky cause unlike me u guys can easily get a boyfriend or a friend for that matter. out of all of us i was the only one that evry1 hated. while u guys are girlfriend matterial and friend worthy, i remaain here being as steph put it "the friends friend." thats y i think i may move to my dads if he'll let me. i dont want to be the friends friend anymore. that's what i was in orillia, barrie and even coldwater. im sick of people saying "youre ashleys stepsister" or yeah youre britt's friend."or "alexs friend" or whoever's. i just wanna be me. maybe if i was me to begin with maybe alex G. would be into me or maybe i wouldn't be known by most orillians as little dion."
