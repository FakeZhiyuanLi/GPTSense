      My opinion of Novell has changed dramatically over the years. Only 4 years ago, I was pleading for my network admin peers to distance themselves as fast as they could from Netware and that Novell was a dead company. Suprise suprise. I really hope Novell can make this new strategy work and thats not only because I own their stock now.   From Infoworld...  "But even though it seems to be holding all the right cards, Novell faces tough odds. In recent years, tough competition from Microsoft and dwindling support from third-party developers have caused Novell's once-loyal base to look elsewhere for infrastructure needs. Unless it can win back the loyalty of the industry, Novell's new, Linux-centric message could fall on deaf ears."  Read the article  urlLink here ..

      A nice D&D twist in the "pulp action" theme of Eberron...it makes for a good laugh.  I found it on the WotC  urlLink Eberron board ....posted by Secretbison   Fantasy Pulp?  Hroth-Jules: What does Mar'Sellus of Wallace look like? Bretticus: What? Hroth-Jules: What realm are you from?! Bretticus: ...What? Hroth-Jules: What? "What" ain't no realm I ever heard of, they speak Common in "What?" Bretticus: ...what? Hroth-Jules: COMMON, ***********, DO YOU SPEAK IT? Bretticus: ...w- Hroth-Jules: SAY "WHAT" AGAIN! SAY. "WHAT." AGAIN. I DARE YOU; I DOUBLE-DARE YOU, **********, SAY "WHAT" ONE MORE ******* TIME! Now, what does Mar'Sellus of Wallace look like? Bretticus: He's a dark elf! Hroth-Jules: More. Bretticus: He's bald! Hroth-Jules: Does he look like a wench? Bretticus: what? Hroth-Jules: (fires his crossbow)

      I really don't like Kobe. I think he needs to look up the defintion of "team" in the dictionary. Anyway, Shaq is now in Miami.  MIAMI (AP) -- It's official: The Shaquille O'Neal era in Los Angeles is over, and his new team is the Miami Heat.  The Lakers and Heat finalized a trade Wednesday sending O'Neal to Miami. Los Angeles gets Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant and a first-round draft pick.  The deal had been on the verge of completion since Saturday, when O'Neal met in Orlando with Heat president Pat Riley and agreed to the trade. NBA attorneys approved it on the same day the league's two-week moratorium on player movement ended.  ...  The trade marks a return to Florida for O'Neal, who began his NBA career in 1992 with Orlando and still has a home there. He led the Magic to the finals in 1995, signed with the Lakers as a free agent in 1996 and helped them win three NBA titles.  Days after the Lakers lost this year's championship series to Detroit, O'Neal demanded to be traded, weary of feuding with Kobe Bryant and feeling disrespected by owner Jerry Buss. He's under contract for $27.7 million this coming season and $30.6 million in 2005-06.  ...  Read the rest at  urlLink CNN .

      Although it is several months old, I found a cool  urlLink article  on Keith Baker and his Eberron setting for  urlLink Wizards of the Coast  in a Boulder, CO newspaper. Good publicity for both Keith and the game we love to play.

      I'm not sure if this a good thing or a bad thing. I guess it depends on how you feel about  urlLink Microsoft  and the  urlLink ISA  product in particular. If you are forced to administer ISA at work, go take a look at the latest version. It has some nice UI enhancements, making things just a bit more logical to use. It also has some new application-level filtering options and also allows IPSEC traffic to external sites.  Read about some of the new features  urlLink here ...

      Keith Baker, creator of the Eberron setting has agreed to personalize a copy of the Eberron Campaign Setting for me. Kudos to Keith for creating the best setting I've seen since Ravenloft and for just being an uber-nice guy.

      From NetworkWorldFusion:   Microsoft to pitch security as 'competitive advantage'   Microsoft will pitch security as a "competitive advantage" at its worldwide partner conference in Toronto next week, but it may be a tough sell to attendees who are still waiting for the software maker to deliver on some of last year's security-related promises.  Microsoft's second annual Worldwide Partner Conference kicks off Sunday. The three-day event is focused on helping its partners to sell more Microsoft products.   Attendees at last year's event, in New Orleans, cheered when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer addressed head-on some of the security challenges the software maker faces and outlined steps it said it would take to address them.  However, Microsoft has yet to deliver on most of the promises Ballmer made. For example, customers are still waiting for a single patching experience and an update to the Software Update Services (SUS) patch management tool, both of which Ballmer said would be out in the first half of 2004, and both of which have been delayed.

      From the WotC site, this  urlLink article  mentions this interesting tidbit...   Elite Tauric Drow/Scorpion   In the traditional settings of the Dungeons & Dragons game, the drow are closely associated with spiders. The Eberron campaign setting, however, associates dark elves with scorpions instead.  The tauric drow/scorpion presented below makes an excellent temple guard or elite killer, and it can easily be advanced in power by adding more class levels. If you're not using the Eberron setting, this NPC can be a rogue outcast from the drow without the religious symbolism of the drider, or perhaps even part of a growing splinter cult within the drow kingdom.  This tauric drow/scorpion was built from a Large monstrous scorpion advanced to 8 HD and a drow with two fighter levels. The tauric template appears in Savage Species and in Monster Manual II, but two modifications to the template have been applied here. First, the creature has the good and poor base saving throws of the base creature, calculated for the number of monstrous humanoid Hit Dice it possesses. Second, it keeps the racial skill bonuses for both the base creature and the base humanoid.    sh0

      Some of you may already be familiar with the  urlLink Fargoth  campaign world, but if you are not, you should take a look. Check out the downloads section, as they have some links to some useful resources. If you enjoy world building, take a look at their templates and see if any of your material is a fit for submission or start writing something that you can contribute to the project.  A quick snippet from their FAQ...   What is the Fargoth World Building Project?   The Fargoth World Building Project is a collaborative effort of interested people, working to design a generic fantasy role playing setting, which any game system could take advantage of. We have opted for Generic over a specific format for several reasons. First, it was felt that the project would appeal to more contributors if we did not force them to channel their creative energies into a specific game system. This also allows the project to be accessed by a much wider variety of people! To date we know of several game systems being operated in the existing elements already created. The other major reason we opted to stay generic is that we felt it unlikely that all of the members could ever agree on a single game system! Like any other large diverse group, each of us has his or her likes and dislikes when it comes to game systems and to avoid infighting we stayed away from the whole subject!    sh0

      I was watching NFL Total Access last night on the NFL Network, and they had a blurb on the Chief's training camp and the fact that currently, Boerigter, Morton and Kennison are all out for at least a week with injuries. Thats a scary thought. Vermeil was typically upbeat about and mentioned that the rookies were getting more reps than normal, so maybe one of them will exhibit some serious talent and challenge the starters to get healthier faster and stay that way...  There is also a new  urlLink article  on the Chief's site...enjoy.
