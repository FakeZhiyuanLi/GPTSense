      So, last Friday on my birthday, my cat turned 11. Yes, his birthday falls on my birthday. Anyway, the part of how smart my cat is that I mentioned a couple of days ago. My cat came and got me because he wanted food, which is no different from any other time. I have an understanding with him that if there's significant food in his plate, he doesn't get any more (unless I'm leaving for the day or something &mdash; I'm not a total ogre); I tend to think this understanding is somewhat one-sided, though when I remind him of it, he'll usually start eating his food. There was a pretty good amount of food in his plate, so no more for him.  He would have none of that. He sprawled out in front of me and cried. He ran around crying. I was going back into the bedroom, and he again threw himself in front of me and cried. I got down to pet him and talk to him, and he cried again. I said, "Clark, your food is NOT tainted; now go finish it." It was plain to me he told me his food was tainted. Then I thought that he's not usually quite so insistent as he had been.  I went to his plate after turning the lamp up all the way, and the food was covered with... ants. He knew his food was tainted and kept trying to tell me, only I wouldn't listen. I think he's pretty smart (and not just because of this), but I shan't go on and on.

      Not a bad day, all things considered. My boss did ask me at least three times within one minute if I was working on a particular project, said project having been completed yesterday. Remind me to share the story of my cat's smartness.    Invader Zim   watching it all over again. "I must get some product" [at least, that's what I recall Gir saying to the door-to-door cosmetics sales-tron. I'm trying to expand my Gir-isms. Now if only I could get my voice to get that off, electronic twinge to it. Anyone have a voice transformer much like the one Sydney used in   Alias  &rsquo;s season three finale in the jail cell next to Sark that will help me more accurately imitate Gir?]

       Wow, what a different day today has been. I'm not sure what happened. Perhaps it was praying this morning:  God, I absolutely cannot go through another day like I have been doing. I am absolutely powerless to do this, and I need Your help to make it through the day.  Well, I'm certainly not a righteous man (except as much as God declares it), but He apparently answered my prayer anyway. Thank You, God, immensely. Thank You that You would deign to consider me in Your plan and working in my life so that my day wouldn't be sucky.  I'm not looking forward to tomorrow, but I think I can get through it okay. I'll even let my neighbor take me out.  Have I mentioned how much I enjoy   Invader Zim   lately? &ldquo;I love that show&rdquo;.

        GIR // GIR is one of the most hilarious people on the show. He's a robot and is SUPPOSED to be helping Zim. His quote is "Can I be a moongoose dog?"    urlLink   Which Invader Zim character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      While driving home from work today, my radio station was set to what I listen to on the way in (104&mdash;love Sam, Maria, and to a lesser extent, Robbie). I forget that most of the music on 104 is not within my realm of appreciation. So I flipped to 106.9, the 80's (and beyond) station [this is also known as The Point, which I discovered one day is a whole family of stations across the country&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;or at least the south].   Anyway, they were on their slew of commercials since they play relatively few during the day. The most annoying commercial I've heard in a while: the Cingular commercial where the daughter is trying to convince her dad to add on a phone. As many times as I've heard this commercial, today it just hit me as screeching. I turned the radio off.  I would have listened to a CD, but I finished at least the 20 th  go around of the soundtrack for  The Prince and Me , and I couldn't safely get to another CD in my briefcase. I haven't seen the movie, but the soundtrack is pretty cool. Why do I have this soundtrack, you wonder? Well, I'll tell you: I won it in a contest. Quite a variety of music, some alternative, hip-hop [me, saying hip-hop as a good thing? go figure!], some not-quite techno, and some other stuff I can't quite identify but I like. There's one song that reminds me of  Arcadia 's "Meet El Presidente".  Once I got home, I got to see the last 30 minutes of  Amercian Idol  and the announcement of the grand winner,  Fantasia  [where's your charge of racism now, Sir Elton John? a bogus, irrelevant claim if I ever heard one]. I had no particular favorite this season (I picked Clay from the beginning of the twelve last year). I kind of liked Jon Stevens [no death threats, please] just because he was so different.  Then I watched news on the local Fox station for about fifteen minutes&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; way too many horrible accidents the past couple of days.   Then I watched the rest of disc 2 of   Invader Zim  . Don't like it? [you lie! YOU LIE!] You just haven't seen it, then. I laughed and chuckled and chortled. Then I stopped. Until I started up again, which was usually within just a minute or so. Gir is my favorite. "I love this show." &lt;switch channel&gt; "I love this show." &lt;repeat&gt; I think   Invader Zim   has taken over   Spongebob Squarepants   as my current favorite cartoon.  Well, conference call at 9 in the morning. Must get to bed.  There's so much to do .  Good night, and God bless.  -jack  P.S.: I didn't forget about writing my thoughts about the morality piece from  Switchback , but I did forget what I wanted to say [must be my early-onset Alzheimer's]. I'll have to think about it some more.

      Well, after being sick yesterday, I went back to work today. I don't know why, but I wound up in a really foul mood by the end of the day. I get home, and my cat decides to "mark" a bag of my stuff. I was not happy. At all. I didn't eat dinner, and I'm hungry but don't feel like eating. Food is currently just something I have to consume, no enjoyment or satisfaction goes along with it.  I dread Friday. One of my neighbors wants to take me to dinner to celebrate, and I just want the day to be over with. At least the next two years, my natal day will be on the weekend. I think my birthday means more to her than to me.  On other fronts (can't dwell in the muck too long -- who wants to read that all the time!), I highly recommend  Invader Zim . I hadn't seen it on TV but picked up the DVD when it was released a couple of weeks ago. I laugh out loud with this one. If you're not into sick and twisted at all, pass  Invader Zim  by. But if you like things off kilter, check this out.  The most recent movie I watched is  Switchback , with Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, and Jared Leto. It's a fair little movie with Quaid as an FBI agent tracking down a serial killer, only with a slight complication on top of that. There are a few suspenseful moments, and a few "Yeah, right" movements. The ending turned out to be pretty anticlimactic. There was enough mystery, though, to maintain my interest. I did come up with an interesting thought about the nature of morality and our adherence or lack of adherence to a moral code. But I'll talk about that another time. Consider yourself whetted.

      This is my first blog report. Thanks, Jason, for encouraging me to do this. It remains to be seen whether I have anything worth writing. Or worth reading, for that matter. If nothing else, it might do me some good to vent some stuff.  Speaking of venting, my birthday is coming up soon, which is no big deal in and of itself. It just happens to be a milestone birthday starting with a "for" and ending with a "tee". I've never held much stock in birthdays; to me, it's always been just another day. Friends have thought it was because I was afraid of getting old. Over that, I don't have much control. I'm not  afraid  to be any age. The main reason I don't celebrate my birthday or treat it just like any other day is that I really don't like a fuss being made over me.  I suppose my big problem with it this year, why this one is hitting me so hard, is not that I'm turning 40 but that I'm turning 40 and have nothing of any relevance to show for my life. :::sigh:::

      I certainly empathize with Paul when he writes about being chief of  sinners, not doing what he wants to do and doing what he doesn't want to.  It seems that on a good day, I might make one good decision out of  twenty. I know I tend to be hard on myself, and it's probably a higher  percentage. But not much higher. Financially, emotionally, physically  (primarily food and exercise), these decisions all seem to just be  wrong, or I have insufficient motivation (food and exercise) to make  better decisions. [I know it'd be healthier, etc., but I don't see that  as imminently better at this point. Loneliness pervades my life, even  when I'm around people, and I don't see that changing.]  The only decisions that I have less (or is that better?) than a horrible  track record concern spiritual decisions. And that's not real good.  Usually the best decision I make here is, "God, I can't do it. Please  help me." But I don't do that nearly often enough.  More on my trip this past weekend to come. I still owe a couple of  posts, I know. I should put a list of "things to come" on the right side  so I can be reminded. :::sigh::: one day...

      So, tomorrow morning, way too early in the morning, I'm flying to New Orleans and then going to visit my parents in Mississippi. Wahoo! All involved are excited, except for that whole work thing ;-). But you take the bad with the good, eh? It's been since Christmas that I got to see them, and it would have been until next Christmas before this little trip came up.

      I went to a wedding last night. It was quite beautiful. Weddings usually are. It was simple, tasteful, and elegant. There were candles&mdash;votives, not pillars or tapers&mdash;on four or five levels, with a vine of roses intertwined in the stand. Very cool stuff. The ceremony itself was quite short&mdash;roughly 15 minutes, the shortest I can recall.  I'm extremely happy for the couple, yet weddings make me sad, very sad indeed. I cannot comprehend opening myself up to anyone, letting them in, being that exposed to someone. Even more than that, I'm barely comfortable that God accepts me fully (a relatively recent development), but to even contemplate that someone might see me as anything more than just some guy who makes you laugh and listens well, well, that is far beyond my limited powers of imagination. I can't imagine letting myself go enough to allow that. I would not be a good husband.  Much like Groucho Marx said about clubs, I would not want to marry someone who would be willing to marry someone like me.

      I wrote this last night via email, but it never got through, for whatever reason.  I know it's been a while since I've posted anything, but it's been an extremely long week. I am continuously amazed at how much God shows me of Himself, and how truly lowly I am (not just looking down on myself as worthless).

      Today, I upheld one vow I made this week: I clipped the cat&rsquo;s  claws. He was not happy. Until it was all over. Then he loves it. Except  when he tries to run and dig into the carpet to change directions. Oops.  At some point soon, I&rsquo;m going to write about victimless crimes;  that&rsquo;s been on my mind the past week or so. Essentially, I  don&rsquo;t think there is such a thing. Of course, it assumes a  particular moral base in my reasoning.  I went to watch friends bowl tonight, then we went out to eat  afterwards. Such good food; I love Mexican food, even if it&rsquo;s  Tex-Mex, not &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; Mexican food. I&rsquo;ve hidden  away from people for so long -- it feels good to be around people,  especially friends from church, people who appreciate you and accept you.  I&rsquo;ve been playing around with Paint Shop Pro lately, trying to do  more with it than I have. It's not Photoshop, but it's not $500+,  either. I&rsquo;ve truly amazed myself at what I&rsquo;ve been able to  produce with my limited knowledge. I came up with a really cool logo for  Exodus (the book we're studying Sunday mornings for 13 weeks).  I&rsquo;ll post it when I&rsquo;m able to upload pictures someplace.  There are some other nifty things I've done (well, I like &rsquo;em  anyway) that I'll post sometime, too.  And I&rsquo;m off to finish MadTV or watch a movie.

      Tuesday night, I went to my weekly Bible study. This cycle, we're  studying Ephesians, and this particular week, we were doing chapter  three. We were kind of circular in the study, touching on subjects two  or three times removed from directly out of the chapter. [I only have a  vague recollection of what we talked about &mdash; I know I should have  written this Tuesday night when I got home, but after three hours of  sleep, I could barely stay awake.]  Anywayz, I came to the conclusion that I've exercised no faith  whatsoever in my view of myself, my circumstances, etc. I know that all  the circumstances I find myself in right now are the direct result of my  own bad decisions and sin. My problem in dealing with it is what can I  expect God to do? My own answer is, "Nothing." I've made my bed, and I  must sleep in it. Unfortunately, I've used nails, razors, and shells to  line the bed rather than nice sheets. I feel that I've wasted my life,  and the remaining years I have here will be spent just dealing with the  consequences of my sins and horrible decisions. And I can't expect God  to bail me out. I've only recently come to accept that I'm allowed to be  in the family, that I'm actually welcomed and will get to be at the  banquet table. I certainly don't think I should be removed from the  consequences of what I have done. It just doesn't work that way: nothing  I have read in the Bible tells me any different, and nothing I have seen  in life supports it, either.  And I realized from what we talked about Tuesday night that I need to  let it go, stop beating myself up about it, and just let God work in my  life. It's conceivable God could actually use me or my circumstances,  even if I see no way that He could or would. But isn't that part of what  makes Him God? He works the impossible in our lives.  So, I'm not expecting anything, but I'm open and willing.

      This past weekend, I wasted pretty much all my time at home except for prep to teach Bible study Sunday morning (we started Exodus). I accomplished nothing, zero, zilch, nada. My friend, Jason,  urlLink wrote  about his room being a wreck; Jason, my friend, I don't think your one room can hold a candle to any room in my apartment except maybe the guest bathroom (where I have some dishes stored on the counter - don't ask!). I can't get motivated to do much the past couple of years or so. I'm tired of living this way, but I'm not willing to do anything about it to rectify the situation.   Which is the story of my life, pretty much. Much like Paul said about doing the things he didn't want and not doing the things he wanted, this applies to my life in so many ways, not just spiritually. I can make a ton of excuses, but ultimately, I'm just lazy, selfish, and, it seems, incapable of making decent decisions.  Don't know where all that came from. I should delete it, but there is that whole lazy thing to consider ;-)  I got to work a little before nine this morning. I got home just in time to write this and post. In case you can't figure it out, I left work a little before midnight. And I have to be back at work early this morning to prepare to do training at 9:00 a.m. I'm a tired puppy. yowsa.

      Just heard the news a few minutes ago about the death of Ronald Reagan, our 40th President, and certainly one of our greatest. It's amazing that they're crediting him with the downfall of communism in the former Soviet Union, (though I am watching Fox) while all these years I've heard journalists and others try to attribute this feat solely to Gorbachev.  Thank you, Mr. President, for your service to your country, for doing the right thing in the midst of strong criticism, and for being a man of integrity. And, most of all, thank you for being a man of God and letting His light shine through you.  Character matters.

         Just finished watching   Castle in the Sky  . Decent film.   Memorial Day at John's house &mdash; Thanks, John! played Tri-Bond (my team won!); sat around and talked. Fun. Sadly, no "Trading Spaces" marathon this year.   Sunday evening at Jack's house watching Charlie's Angels.   Made it to Saturnday night church for the first time in several months. Great service, though I'm not too sure about this "fellowship" time beforehand. I'm not too outgoing, and it's difficult for me to go up to meet people on the fly.   Didn't make it to see  The Day After Tomorrow  this weekend. Apparently enough of you did for it to take in well over $80MM. I'm only interested in the special effects, not the story. I do like Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal (had to look that one up). Oh, and Sela Ward, too!   Swam this morning. Actually, I rode my bike, but with 110% humidity, it felt like I was swimming. I see collapsing into bed before midnight tonight since I've been awake since 5am.   listening to Rubicon 7 in the car; wish I could listen to music at work. I think I would be much more productive than playing receptionist every five minutes or so. It's making me jittery, man, jittery, I tell you.    These posts always wind up longer than I intend them to be.

                      One of my friends made the comment in response to my passing on a news story to her that that's why some people don't watch the news, because it's all bad. I know some people are overly sensitive to what they see and can't handle the bombardment. But if you can handle the bombardment, have you thought about praying for the people in the stories you see or hear? There's no shortage of people that need prayer, that's for sure. Wars, disasters, murders, corruption in high and low places, assaults, and just plain accidents -- do you think God can work through these situations? Who in these situations don't need prayer? don't need Jesus? don't need some true love in their lives? Even if you can't personally interact with the person(s) involved, you  can  pray.

                      Well, the baseball game was a blast.  These were my seats  (click on section 122). Sweet, eh? Sadly, the Astros lost. If I actually cared anything about baseball, it might have mattered to me. Home team and all, I'll root for them to win, but my life goes on the same, win or lose. I enjoyed it for what it was. Even when I watched the Rockets win back-to-back championships (thanks for the coverage,  Sports Illustrated  -- read with heavy dose of sarcasm since they hardly admit Houston even exists), I was very happy for the players, mind you, but my life was not changed for the better.    Movies, though, I relate to. I had some stuff written about this, but it's tripe in its present form. I'll have to work on it sometime. Just know that moobies has been berry berry goot to me.

                           read an article about unsuspecting internet users getting "extra" charges on their credit card. I hate things hidden in fine print, and the companies that do these things should be fined horribly (and can the people who actually have the damages get some financial remuneration on this? Fines are fine, but doesn't it just go to the state? The victim doesn't get anything, AFAIK.)     saw  I, Robot  tonight; much better than I thought it would be. To the reviewer on slate or salon that said they just get Asimov wrong, I can only say we didn't see the same movie. What'd you do, see the trailers, watch the first ten or fifteen minutes, and then go to sleep with your free pass? (I've been to enough sneaks where the reviewers go to sleep.) Not totally wrong, but close enough.          The Bourne Supremacy  on Saturday morning; gotta love matinees. BTW, it's   The    Bourne Supremacy , not just  Bourne Supremacy . One of our local DJs got called on it from the studio (true story).     Listened to local Christian radio station last week for about 20-30 minutes. There was no Stephen Curtis Chapman--I was massively shocked. I thought Christian music was equivalent to SCC (not to be confused with the SEC, in whom I take no stock, nor should it be confused with the FCC, who might fine me for what I think of SCC--well, only if I spoke it on-air somewhere. Of course, my opinion of SCC would probably incite a riot -- is that what it would take for Christians to take some kind of action?). Anywayz, I heard this super-annoying song. It turned out to be Switchfoot; I think the song was "The Beautiful Letdown". That off-key note on this "on" sound, over and over and over again. Blech.     Listened again to the local Christian radio station for about 10 minutes. A catchy song followed by some old-sounding song followed by a song that had lame (read: clich&eacute;) lyrics, mediocre vocals, uninspiring music. Sure enough, it was SCC. It's bound to be a hit.     Going to a baseball game tomorrow night for free (except parking and food). $40 seats. Wahoo!     Got to talk to my mother Tuesday night for the first time in well over a week. Considering we normally talk at least three or four times a week, I was going through withdrawal. She might have been glad for the break; she said she was, anyway. :-)      Well, I guess that's all for now.

      Tonight, I went to the church choir concert where they presented their  summer tour music (they traveled to the northeast and sang at various  places). They were excellent, and I have never heard them sound better.  Technically, they have always been top-notch. Tonight, though, they had  the sound to match their 100+ number, which I've never noticed from them  before. They were so good, in fact, that I considered thinking about  joining (I must be one of those people that, when I see a good thing, I  have to go in and destroy it LOL).  After the concert, we had a reception for our organist of 29 years who  is retiring "sometime soon". We sure didn't have "fellowship"  food--delicious doesn't begin to describe how good the food was. I was  glad I didn't gorge like I have in the past.  I know that I've always had trouble feeling like I fit in anywhere. In  college, I talked about someone to a friend of mine (not gossiping), and  he said that he didn't run in the same social circle with that person.  My response was, "I think my social circle is a dot." I can fit in most  anywhere, from (not too) upper crust to (not too) low-brow; I know  enough to not make a complete fool of myself, and I'm accepting enough  that I don't come across as a snob. But I've never been a part of any  group except on the periphery.  Tonight, though, at the reception, I found myself wandering around from  little group to little group, not finding anywhere to alight for more  than a minute or so. I tried to engage people, but I guess there were  too many distractions. It seems to me that I've made relatively decent  progress in the past few months or so at trying to be more involved with  people rather than living my isolationist lifestyle. Tonight, however,  when I wanted to be around people, there was no having it. :::sigh:::

                      On the way home from work tonight, Karen called and asked if I wanted to go see  13 Going on 30  at the dollar theatre. Being in love with Jennifer Garner since the first time I saw "Alias", it took me no more than a nanosecond to decide to go, though it was considerably longer before I agreed vocally. (Sorry, Jason.) It was about exactly what I expected, but I did want it to be better. The premise: magic dust grants 13-year-old Jenna her wish to be 30, flirty, and fun, but when she gets there, she's not the same person at all, at least she hasn't been.    I got to thinking (b/c I sure didn't have to think about the movie) that I wish life was like that sometimes, that you could truly get a do-over. But life isn't like that; we don't live in a fantasy world. However, if nothing else, this movie and its ilk should serve as a warning to consider your actions carefully. You do have to live with your actions, and everyone else does, too.

                        FYI: I haven't posted much because I've been so tired by the time I get home from work. I can get through email and that's about it.      At lunch today, all the usual lunch cronies were otherwise occupied, so I went to Whataburger (read it slowly) and read in the Bible Exodus 13:17-15:21 for teaching on Sunday. In particular, Exodus 14:14 stuck out to me:      The   Lord will fight for you while you keep silent    .  (NAS)    Li  ke so many thing s in the Bible, to the point and reassuring at the same time.       Well, I hope to start   The Big Sleep   tonight after I finish with this and essential email. I tried watching it the other night while playing a game, but after twenty minutes, all I knew was that Humphrey Bogart had been employed to do something after being hit upon by some blonde bimbo. I suppose it's a movie one must pay strict attention to.       Speaking of   I, Robot  , I finished reading that last night. This is the first book I've read in ages. As I thought, other than being about robots and involving Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, the movie releasing tomorrow (as of this writing) has nothing to do with the book, at least according to the trailers I've seen. I haven't seen   Ali  , but everything else I've seen Will Smith, while fun, isn't all that serious.       And with that resnark, I'm off... to email (besides just the normal being off).

                      I recently (five minutes ago from this writing) read an article on  article on Lockergnome  about when you knew you were a computer geek. I was in ninth grade (1978-79 school year), in the GT program. Somehow, we got a TRS-80 in our weekly class, and I was instantly fascinated. I couldn't play sports, and I wasn't that good in band (even though I enjoyed it thoroughly). But here was something that I could actually make happen. And no one teased me in the process. When my very existence incited ridicule and derision from my peers (and the teachers allowed it in class), it was kind of nice to be able to do something without being judged for it. (imagine my frustration with Micro$oft Word trying to tell me what I want to do...)    And I've been pretty decent at it ever since then. Not great, but better than average. Kind of sad that the machines are easier to relate to than so many people. I'm glad that the people I'm around now aren't like junior high kids (though I've seen some that have never grown up). Check out  urlLink Why Nerds are Unpopular  for more thoughts on this whole phenomenon. The article is lengthy, but I pretty much support everything in it. There ya go.

      So, I wound up surviving the Fourth weekend. On Sunday, a friend called me to go see  Spider-Man 2  since his wife and kids were gone (she on the aforementioned choir trip, the kids with the wife's parents at a beach house in Freeport). Then I went back to his place, watched some Wonder Woman, then some other of his (and my) friends came over, and we watched  The Italian Job  (the remake, not the original). It was lots of fun. Then I wound up going to down to Freeport with my friend on Monday morning to keep my friend company since he forgot to leave something (like a car seat for the baby). Overall, it turned out not to be a totally sucky weekend.  Then, Monday night, I watched  The Sand Pebbles . Excellent movie, directed by Robert&nbsp;Wise, the same guy that did  The Sound of Music  and many other movies that I've enjoyed over the years.

                      A long weekend.   (and there was much rejoicing)   yay.... Not that I'm sad to have a long weekend, but I have no plans to go anywhere or do anything, and most of my friends are on a choir trip to D.C., NY, and points between and around. As I was driving home from work last night, it dawned on me how alone I would be this weekend. Usually, I don't mind being by myself, but for some reason, I don't want to be alone this weekend. Yet here I am. I suppose it'll be time to catch up on my movies from Netflix. Speaking of....    I watched  Sunset Boulevard  last night for the first time (this was the short movie at 110 minutes -- the others are 179, 227, and 230 minutes, which should eat up some time). What an excellent movie all the way around. Story, acting, sets, lighting, costuming, all were excellent. And the story still stands viable today. It makes me want to investigate Billy Wilder more as a director, to possibly join my two favorites, Tim Burton and Ridley Scott (not to be confused with his brother, Tony Scott).    I wonder if I'll ever be an ever-was; I sure feel like a has-been right now, or, more correctly, a never-was. I don't want to be famous, and I don't think I deserve more than anyone else, but I want to have some sense of accomplishment in my life. I have an idea of something to come, but I can't see any path to it right now, if ever. It's not something I would have come up with on my own, but something I feel God calling me to. If it happens, it will definitely be all God and not me. I recently listened to a motivational speaker on PBS's quarterly membership drive programming, and she said that your life truly starts at 40. That would certainly be nice since I'm there now.    Otherwise, though, forty sucks.

      Yesterday after I deposited my reimbursement check, I headed to Sam's to  buy my way cool shirt on tax-free weekend. I saw an H2, not an  attractive vehicle to begin with, and it was painted--get this--a  pearlescent lime green! It was hideous! And then it started to grow on  me. At the end of ten seconds, I decided it wasn't all that bad a color.  For an H2. It still scares me that I liked it. :::shiver:::

                      This week, outside of my Netflix flicks (say that three times real fast), I've watched most of a serial entitled  The Phantom Menace . This was part of a two-serial set I bought a Sam's (I also recently got a Sherlock Holmes set -- four movies!). Being from 1935, I didn't expect a great deal of depth or super special effects (everybody  knows  special effects didn't exist until  Star Wars  in 1976, right? but IMDb says that two guys worked on special effects -- something must be wrong).    Yes, it's cheesy; the video quality is pretty poor; the audio drops out occasionally; the effects are pretty minimal; the cliffhanger endings are cheated horribly; and the subtitles, if enabled, just show "AUDIO" occasionally rather than actual speaking parts, as though someone forgot to master the words onto the track. Well, it's a lot of fun.     I kept thinking while watching it, though, how could the story be updated and appeal to modern audiences? No singing cowboy (sorry, Mr. Autry, though you did okay for the time) for our day. Special effects can be better, for sure. For one, they could actually exist. Hey, if "The Outer Limits" can do okay with the serviceable yet unspectacular effects, we could probably do okay, too. The biggest problem would be to find a motivation for a bunch of kids to get together to form the Junior Thunder Riders. Okay, I'll stop now. (though I would love to develop my five-year plan for a TV version of  Reign of Fire  -- more dragons!)

                      Last night, I watched  The Winslow Boy . It's a very good movie primarily about the relationship between a man in post-Victorian England and his three children, two boys and a girl. The youngest, 13-14 year old Ronnie, gets into trouble at the military school he attends and is expelled. He maintains his innocence throughout, and the whole family sacrifices to fight to prove his innocence in light of the seemingly incontrovertible evidence against him. The trials or hearings are essentially off-camera the entire movie and serve as the unifying force for the family, even the oldest brother, Dickie (the second movie in the past week with a character named "Dickie"; hmmm), giving up his position at Oxford. This movie is very character-driven, typical of virtually all of Mamet's works; if you're looking for action, take a Valium and the movie will seem very fast. [This should not be construed as an endorsement of the illicit use of drugs, or the use of illicit drugs.] I highly recommend this movie.    This evening, I watched two episodes of "Sledge Hammer" from the recently-released Season 1 DVD set. I laughed until I stopped. Truly.    -out

                           Last Friday, I went to see  The Village , M. Night Shyamalan's latest. Regardless of critics, I found the movie quite entertaining and captivating. Beautifully shot, very nice acting, compelling story, it had it all. Were there plot points that were messed up? Perhaps. How much of a stickler for detail are you? If you demand perfection, then you've really set yourself up for tremendous disappointment. Otherwise, go, have fun, be scared. But don't go into the woods. Please.         Saturday, out of the blue, I found out I got a raise. WOW! I was completely shocked. And I had just prayed Friday or Saturday morning on the way into work, "God, I just can't handle having no more money. I can't get out of debt, and I can't even think about doing the other things you're calling me to without any money." If you're not in debt, stay away from it at any cost. If you're in it, you can commiserate with me. It's a horrible trap.     Watched  Teaching Mrs. Tingle  tonight. Blech. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good, either. Individual parts were good, but combined it was less than the sum of its parts.     I watched  The Talented Mr. Ripley  last week over the course of two or three nights. What a freaky and disturbing movie. Matt Damon was excellent in this, as were Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.     The third disc of "Rahxephon" came in from Netflix, and I was not horribly happy about it: it had only three episodes on the disc. Why? Disc one had five episodes, and disc two had four episodes. Will disc four have two episodes? I hope not. Anywayz, after watching my three episodes, I was terribly confused, which is not necessarily a difficult thing to do, but all the same, I was still confused. We'll see what happens with the rest of the series to see if it makes sense.
