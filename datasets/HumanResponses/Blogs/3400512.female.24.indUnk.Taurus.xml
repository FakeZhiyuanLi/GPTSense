      We had the rehearsal and everything was very confusing.  I'm hoping that I won't flip out during the actual ceremony.  I am very, very nervous about the whole thing.  We had a great rehearsal dinner, though.  The food was wonderful and everyone had a good time, although my step father spilled sake all over my shoulder.  I went to bed around 11:30 and woke up around 2 worrying about everything.  I'm surfing the internet until I can no longer keep my eyes open.  There is no point in tossing and turing.  Today is going to be crazy.  I have hair and make up appointments starting at 9.  My fancee's sister in law and I don't like each other too much and she is showing her disapproval of me not allowing babies at the ceremony and reception by not showing up for anything except the actual wedding.  She didn't come to the rehearsal or rehearsal dinner but she was supposed to come to the dinner.  She is also skipping out on the pictures.  She is such a baby in general but especially when she doesn't get her way.  I predict that we will have a tense future together at holidays and other family gatherings, but I really don't give a fuck.  It's nobody's fault but her own that she acts like a brat all the time.  I can't wait for the honeymoon.  I'm getting very excited about going to San Francisco.  We have a very early flight but I guess we can sleep on the plane.  I hear there are all kinds of things to do in San Francisco and I'm sure we'll have a great time.  We are also visiting Napa Valley.  The weather is supposed to be wonderful and especially at this time of year.  Wish me luck.

      I'm doing OK so far.  Packing is a bitch.  I'm looking forward to San Francisco but I'm still nervous as hell about the wedding.  And I really hate my dress now.  It still looks frumpy even after we had it taken in.  I should have waited.  It just doesn't look right on me anymore and I'm very upset about the fact that I won't look my absolute best on the one day that I'm supposed to, the one day that will live on forever in the most important pictures I will ever take in my life.  I have made up my mind to quit my job.  I have to in order to make any sort of progress in my life.  It's holding me back and the schedule and the benefits are no longer worth it.  I need experience and I need bigger paychecks.  I can't even pay my bills with this crap pay.  Retail is a horrible place to be and all retail managers are jerks by nature.  They have to be.  They basically screw people over for a living.
