      Well, sorry about the long break, but i didnt really feel like posting, just not in the mood. So, back too the talky talky, I dun really remember anything big from the weekdays of last week so fast forward to friday night.  Friday- I figure out Im go to madys B-day party on saturday. Well we (me cam kelsey and cassie) decide we shoud go to the mall cause kelsey and cassie want to by mady presents. So Im just about to go pick up cam when neil calls and says him belac and brittany will meet us there so yea. So we all meet up and walk around lookin for stuff to buy and i stumbled upon some shoes. They were on sale for about $30 marked down from $80 and im not a big fan of DC shoes but i decided i gotta try them out. their decent but im not gonna skate them until my Fallens are shot. So after the mall everyone was supposed to come over but ended up only neil, belac, and cam did. We played some basketball and CS and whatnot and just pretty much hung out, nothing to big. They all left at about 10 and i just talked on the phone and played cs till 2ish. Saturday- Wake up to Aj calling me at noon telling me to get ready for madys. So we get out to Prior Lake (The party was at her parents friends house, it was awesome) about 3ish and we just go boating and the girls wanted to tube so they did and we all just rode in the boat. Pretty good stuff since it was so incredibly cold out it was hilarious. Just a pretty simple but fun day. Went home, played CS till about 2. Sunday- Wake up to Tim calling me asking if i want to go to a movie with a bunch of people at 1:25. I said sure and him and erik came over. We went to go see shrek 2 with Rachel, Kassi, Robbie, and Neil and it wasnt that good. it was pretty boring. We walk from the theatre to Neils and just hung out there till about 5. Then me and erik came to my house and tim went home. I call cam and he comes over about 6. We get Tim back over at about 7 and kelsey and cassie came over at about 8:30. We watched some really gay movie that was so incredibly low budget and the acting was the worst ive seen in a long time. Then cam erik and tim leave about 10. Kelsey and Cassie were over till about 11 and we just played with my bird and what not, sure sounds great doesnt it?? lol Monday- We had the day off and i went to Travis' about 2 for his sisters graduation party. It was raining on a nd off all day but it was pretty fun. Played horse shoe, badminton (however you spell it), jumped in an inflatable jumpy thing and went mud boggin in this one guys truck. It was a grand ole time. Even got to skate the mini pipe a little but i got a nice annkle bite from the board ramming into my ankle. Came home at 7ish and played some cs, and now im just sitting here listening to some music. good stuff. But Im gonna go do some review packet for History so i will hopefully post during the week this time!! lol, good day                      -Ryan

      I dunno why, but all the sudden im just hella pissed that i cant do anything tonight. its the forth saturday in a row so i shouldnt be reacting any different, but im just hella mad all the sudden. God this is gay, i hate this.  Being grounded is so incredibly gay. I really got just do something with my time right now but there isnt anything to do. I just feel like i should be doing something. Well, F this, im gonna go take a shower cause i was just skating on my neighbors board and i relaly just wanna waste up some time so i feel like im achieving something or atleast make it a little closer to sleeping so i dont have to think about this. And im not even gonna say good day, cause im flippin pissed, so assbye                    -Me

      'ELLO 'ELLO, it is grand to have a new one of these beasts. Thanks to cam my bloop was deleted and my other one (dont remember the host) was cancelled cause of not posting, but this one seems more simple and too my liking, cause simple = good. Well last night was a nice evening, went to Rachels for a surprise B-day party. Skated for the first time in like a month and surprisingly wasnt as bad as i had expected to be after that long of a break. I need to buy a new board like immediatly, but yea. The party was fun, Finally got to hang out with kelsey and cassie and the like after being grounded for so long. We just pretty much hung out like an old school gathering from back in the day. At like 9 a bunch of us went to the beach and just chilled like ice. Went back to Rachels and me erik and robbie made a fire, and yeah, hung out outside when the other people came back. Over all it was a good night, but i didnt get to be around people that i wanted to be as much as i would have liked. Then today Im still half grounded where since i went out last night i cant go out tonght, which is incredibly gay, cause there is another party. Hmm, well im gonna go sit around and do nothing since like every single person is at jaclyns now or are going soon, well looks like a long night of sitting around doing nothing, and not talking to anyone once again. Good day all                        -Ryan

      hello all. Well i know i said i was gonna post like 2 weeks ago but i never did. My internet went gangsta on me again so i couldnt even if i had wanted to. But, to say what has happened lately. The camping experience was pretty boring, but our cabins were so awesome. I got my own room!!! Everyone else shared rooms but i got my own so it was pimp. There was hardly anybody within my age by 5 years so i sat around alone alot there. I met Kyle, who was 15, and he was so flippin good at skating. he did the 7 stair handrail right by the parking lot but i didnt have my camera around so i couldnt film it. I got my cousins to film for me though so i got some stuff but nothing big. Now after that weekend Ive been living summer like it should be lived. Ive been sitting around, staying up late, sleeping plenty and skating constantly. Its all a blur of the past two weeks except the past 2 days so i cant really explain anything but those days. Well, for the past 2 days ive gone to eriks and we just skate around, play badminton and plenty of videogames. then yesterday we went tubing on orchard lake which was awesome. We went with 2 tubes and 2 people on each tube. It was pretty awesome. Then today Im going to go see spiderman 2 but i have to go get ready to go to travis', so good day.

      jeez, this is literally one of the longest times i have gone without internet. Because of Norton system docter my aim and internet were blocked for ass long but because im so pimp i got it workin again. If CS wouldnt have been working the whole time i would have shot someone in the face. But, since my last post alot has happened. I finished 9th grade on the eigth of the month. Hmmmm, what happened before that, i really cant remember, probably alot of sitting around and studying. But that night Becky had a party and we skated, and chilled like homies. Kelsey and Cassie jacked me and cams shoes and we didnt get them back till thursday. My cousins are here as we speak, and 2 are still awake talking to me as i type this. I dont really mind them but in reality i havent spoken more then a couple words to each one. I got my hair cut also on the 7th. All this is kinda jumbled into different times every other sentence but Im just typing recent things and as i remember stuff from earlier this week i type that so it might be hard to understand. But back to other things. Ive been listening to techno alot for the past 2 days. It has to be the sweetest stuff ever. We listened to it for like an hour straight at eriks today and it makes you so full of energy. We were just sprinting around not getting tired at all. We played night games also but it was pretty gay. Saw Cronicles of Riddick today. It was pretty good, alot of pimp killin. Right now Kelsey and Cassie are at Whistler. Im so flippin jealous, Im dying to snowboard. I would literally give up CS for life to be at whistler with them right now. Their probably sitting in a hot tub with a bunch of pros as we speak, lol. And also while their there i literally am bored out of my mind at night not talking to anyone on the phone. Not having them around makes my life about 10 times more boring, haha. I got a new skateboard yesterday, Iota. I needed one, skating is my only substitute for snowboarding. Well, i think im out of things to remember so I might not post until thursday cause im going to a family reunion on monday till then so yeah.                        -Ryan                  ps, i bet kelsey and cassie are havin the time of their lives while all of us are sitting on our asses, lol

      Hello all, nothin much new happened. Last night i went to jays and we skated around a bit, and what not. Becky, Cam, and Erik came over so that was spiffy. We played some vid game and what not and just were lazy. Me and Erik tried to fix jays tv for Liz (jays mom) cause all the wiring is haggard and we had to hook the xbox into it and replace the vcrs spot. Let me tell you, dont ever try to do that in their basement. You will get a head ache and feel like commiting suicide. We beat the suffering there also which is a very spiffy game and i recommend it to you. Then we drove Becky home and Jays uncle came over then and decided to spend the night on the basement couch. So we avoided the basement for awhile and decided to play uno at about 11:15. Dont play uno with us 4, we wont give up. We played one round that lasted like 10 min and then the second game started. 2 1/2 hours of pure UNO! No bathroom breaks, no looking at the clock, no food (except one milky way bar for all 4 of us). But of course guess who won???!?? ME! F all you! Im god of uno, but i must give Cam a couple thanks for assisting me and a nice big F U!!! to erik cause hes the reason it lasted so long. We got done around 2ish and went to jays room. Cam had never seen jays uncle so we had to go filming. I couldnt stop laughing because of Cam so it was hella scury cause that uncle would bust a cap. Then i came home in the morning, mowed the lawn, showered, and ate. Jay called later and he came over and he skated while i rollerbladed. I can kinda do unitys now but i cant get out of them. Its a pimp grind i tell ya. Then skateboarding i learned switch pop shuv reverts and tried switch pop shuv 50-50 but couldnt lock in. Jay left around 10:30 and ive been on the comp since then but i think im gonna go listen to some music. Good day                      -Ryan  Close Yet Far by CKY, listen to it, pimp shiat

      yeah well my plan to switch to xanga completely changed when i noticed that you get billions of popups on that site, so f them. Well today was hella boring, Belac and Neil came over, then we went to eriks and travis cam and colin were there. Me Andy and neil biked to BK and holiday and it was only kinda raining when we left to go. Then once we walked out of Holiday it was pouring so we had to bike back in the Rain so when we got back we were covered in mud and soaking wet, hella gay. But it was actually worth it cause me and andy both won free burgers, lol. Then we sat around playing vid games, and doing nothing at all. Jeez, my life has been ass boring lately, I really gotta try and achieve something, lol. Well, thats it, SO now you can rest well knowing that I am staying on BLOGGER!!!! o yes, good evenin'                         -Ryan
