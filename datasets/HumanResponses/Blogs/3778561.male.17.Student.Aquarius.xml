      Well last nights election was a nail biter, it really was. Numbers for the Liberals took an early lead 20 seats here in Atlantic Canada went to the Liberals, 3 to the Conservatives, and 3 to the NDP. I think it was a jolly good show! I am just glad that a Conservative rideing here in ole Newfounldland switched over Liberal! Good job Scott Simms, I was up untill about 1:20 am last night watching the resuts pour in from around the nation. But at 11:54 P.M. NST it was announced that the Liberals would have the minority government then a sigh of releaf come apon me and I was glad! Well  I slep in this morning till 9:30 A.M. that is good for me I am usually up much earlyer! But ahh well that is about all I have to say for now. Until tomorrow!

      Well life is good, School is over! A time of great reflection on the year and all things that partain to it. I am glad that summer is here but with summer comes alot of extra time so thats what I am doing this for to journal my summer basically. This is Election day and the time for choosing new government is at hand, hopefuly the Liberals will win and become the government once more! A Conservative government holds a scary future and thats not something to look forward too. On mylimbo I will be posting some stuff on the election over the night as it arises or as the oppertunity to get on computer comes up. Well that is all that I have to say for now. Until next time.

      Yay! I am going swimming today with my friend Chris O and Dustin P! Thsi shall be fun we are going to the new Family Adventure Park , water park. I have never seen it but it is supposed to be really nice. I think it may be cold where it is because its up in the hills literly and well I think it may be colder up around there. Also I was supposed to have a Strawberry Festival Committee meeting today but that did not happen we will just have one tomorrow on the feild. Well we got the kiddie rides and Broken Arrow bcak so this should be great all around I look forward to this weekend and all the fun it shall bring. Also my ferrets are doing well had them out for a long walk last night Dustin and myself brought them out around both cats like to keep their distance from them which is understandable because they are just like the squirls they usually hunt but this time they are pets.  We also got a great fright with our cat Princess last night we thought she got hit by a car because my brother was walking up the road kinda late at night and it looked like there was much blood all over her but really it was mud but we did not find that out until she came in the house it did kinda look like blood. Well thats about all I have to say for now, so until the next entry.

      Well its a real nice day out there today. The sun is shineing and  there is a slight breeze. I went into Corner Brook today with Chris, his sister, and Julia. That was fun I priced some stuff I needed to get for the ferrets.  I have a meeting tonight at 7:00 P.M. and that is for the Strawberry Festival. I think we can totally out do the Deer Lake festivities. But thats in m opinion. At 3:00 P.M. I have to put on supper for mom not a big task lol!

      Well these are the names of my two new ferrets! I bought two of them today they are great! They are both females and desented and fixed. Although they still have a sent to them it is not so bad. I keep them in my basement and almost everyday now I have to spray them in desenting fluid so that they do not make a stink. I also learned that they can catch and pass on the flu to humans. So we will have to be careful around them during the cold season. Well I went to the Deer Lake Strawberry Festival twice this weekend it was fun. But I have came to the conclusion that Deer Lake is the grumpier version of Pasadena but thats minor stuff. Well our Festival is in a week we have caught a minor problem one of the bands have droped out so we will se how that progresses tomorrow (Monday) we need someone new to play bad!!!  Ahhh well that is all that I have to say for this entry, until next entry.

Well thats about all that I have to say for today because there is really nothing better to talk about. So thats all for today entry. Until the next entry!

      Well the Liberals have picked their new cabinet and in my opinion did not throw Newfoundland and Labrador a bone! Well John Efford got his Minister of Natural Resourses back again that is the only ministry position that went to Newfoundland. Now for Parlimentry Secretaries  positions Newfoundland got one of those positions also it went to our own Gerry Byrne he got Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs under minister Lucienne Robillard. Well for one of the only provincies that shown a Liberal gain in seats he did not throw us in any bit extra. But anyways on to other news lol the Strawberry Festival Committee is going well things are getting planed and I think we will do very well for a small committee of only five members. Also I got my movie Life as a House finially came in which it really goo. I will be going to watch that movie in its entirerty after I complete what I have to do on the Internet. Well thats about all I have to say for this entry. Until next entry.

      Well last night the next season of Big Brother and The Amazing Race started yah! I really enjoy watching thes two shows! Reality TV at its finest, Now I have been watching Big Brother  seince its prmier in season 1 with my fav character Chicken Man George. Now we are into the fifth season already and the game has changed over this time. Well they have family members in it together now whats next well they have Identical twins in it and they will be switching every once and awhile to shake things up abit. Then they have to unknown family member in the game well one of them knows now! He just have not told his half sister yet! I think that this is a bad way to do things but rateings is all that really matters. Also something I can see in the near future for Big Brother will be a All Star season or a Celebrity season or maybe even a season where people from all different televison reality show come together and compete in this one super Big  Brother I dunno. Well you know there in the works for up comeing seasons for like every reality TV show. Every show does it and why shoulent thay! I personally think these are the shows that are very interesting to watch. Well for the Amazing Race this season they have a former cast member from another season of Big Brother Allison and his boy friend  Donny. They seem to argue alot thats what makes them interesting to watch. Well the only onther thing that I can talk about is I have a Strawberry Festival Committee meeting tonight and well I look forward to that. This committee gives me something to do during the summer. See I do not idol that well so this gives me something to pick away at and I like to have things to doo. And well this is also just something else to do for me during the summer months while school is out. And well who knows I might just keep thos blog going when I go back to school because I kind of enjoy journaling all of my major activities and thoughts. I also watched the movie Butterfly Effect last night that was a good movie and I suggest that you all (By you all I mean anyone if anyone that read this go and see it!) go and see it! I also had another movie called 25th hour with Edward Norton he is a fairly good actor but I did not get a chance to watch this movie. Ahhhhh well thats all that you can do. Well that is all that I have to write about today. Until my next journal!

      Well the summer days just keep geeting longer it would seem, I get more lazier by the day slowly falling out of my School routien. I am still used to have Recess as a meal so I still eat around that time in the day when recess would roll arounf. I will have to go back to this routiene in September anyways so why not just stick with it so that you never have to get back into it. Did what I write then even make sence? In my mind it does but anyways. Well yesterday where I did not post Dustin came over and I did him off a couple of CD's. I went for a bike ride into get him and we stopped at subway and the pool. After Dustin left I went with him on the ride home and I got Chris and we came over here and watched some TV and well before we came here we went to Irving and looked around at the movies there. But where it was Monday I have gotten to the point where I have seen a majority of the good movies at Irving so like the only day I rent movies is on Tuedays when the new releases come out. That reminds me I should call up and see what came in. But also later on today I have a Softball game in CB well I do not actually play but I keep score so that is fun for me. Well that is about all I have to say for today, Until next post!

      Well lots of things have came up lately that I was not able to post but the jist of it is that I am lazy ha, ha, ha! Well I have gone to see movies in the last little while such as Dodgeball which is reall funny and stars Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn. I would reccomend that you give this movie a watching because it is really good! Also a movie that I seen last night was Spiderman 2. This is another great movie that I would reccomend you go to see because it is great it far out do's the original movie. Well now that summer has set in the temperature has gone up and well I have became much more active I go out for walks now and I enjoy them. I call them aimless pointless walks becuase they have no point what so ever so that is why I call them that! Well that is about all I have to say for now until next time I get a chance to post.

      Well school is fastly approaching and the summer seems to be winding down. There is not anything to do anymore and I am kinda geeting in a board downslump. I have been visiting some fun new websites that I was reccomended to go and check out which I did and really enjoyed. I have spent alot of time on them the last three or four days. I am slowly buliding a country and on this other web page I am the leader of the Liberal Party. Well thats all that I have to say for now. Until next time.

      Well yesterday Late Night with Conan O'Brien 10th Anniversary Special came out on DVD . SO makeing a trip into Corner Brook with  Chris O last night we went to Wal-Mart to get the DVD but when we got there they had no copies of it, it never came in. So I thought to myself where else in Corner Brook would carry this DVD? Then I thought of the place Dominion yes I know a grocerary store but they do have a great electronics section that gets in new releases and usually at cheaper prices then Wal-Mart. So I went over and yes I got it for just under $17.00 and yay! Its the best DVD ever so funny! Yeup also yesterday I watched both Lord of the Ring Movies the first 2 they were better then I expected. I will soon rent Return of the Kings the third and final movie in that trilogy. Also Dustin yesterday asked me to write a "Letter of Reccomendation" on why he should win a award on his Duct Tape Wallets product which is cool. Well thats all I have to talk about for today. Until next entry.

      I have a theory that a place that lays in the middle of two valleys will not be effected by the weather from the main valley make its weather patterns differ from other places just outside of it. We have experienced this today. Thunder Showers effected Deer Lake and Corner Brook but left Pasadena relatively untouched. This also happens in the winter time a lot when School close in both Deer Lake and Corner Brook because of blizzard like conditions. But in Pasadena every thing will be fine and dandy. But that’s interesting to me I have made a diagram which you can look at on mylimbo under “Local”. Well thats all I have to write for today. Until next entry.  - http://mylimbo.rawr32.net/forums/index.php

      Well today was an eventful day. I woke up at 9:00 A.M. this morning and layed in bed until I finially got up at 10:30 A.M.ish. I then went on a totally random bike ride where I met up with Adam and Jo. Then we wnt to Needs and I got a Gatorade and Turtles and then Tom came. SO about 10 miniuts later sadly Jo had to leave to go back to Corner Brook. So Adam, Tom and Myself stayed around talking for awhile and then Adam left and me and Tom went to Justins and we seen Duncan and also when we got there Jason W was there. After leaving there we proceeded onto some more "Botiques" that can be found around town and also stopped in for some Subway yum, yum, yum. Well that about all that I have did so far today  but theres still alot of day left yet who knows what I will do! Well thats all I have to say for now. Until next post.
