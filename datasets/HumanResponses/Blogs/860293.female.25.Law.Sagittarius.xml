       Is Toronto the Place to Be?  Well, Mike Chaiton has recently decided that Toronto is the place to be... as have many people from my past, present and I would expect future. So originally I sat, bewildered and distraught, over how Toronto was drawing all of my friends into its concrete grasp... is it some kind of witchcraft? is it the devil himself? And then last night, I discovered the answer. I was on a boat cruise, along with a large group of other law students, and 4 unsuspecting representatives from the firm of McCarthy Tétrault. Two from Tdot itself, and two from London Ontario. Well I ended up in a discussion with one of the McCarthy reps from London, and mentioned how I was violently opposed to the idea of ever being forced to succumb to life in Toronto. The traffic, the smog, those friendly yet somewhat frightening mooses... how could I put up with these things when I could be somewhere like Ottawa? That's when the brillance of this young woman shined through, and Toronto became perfectly clear to me. We are nothing but lemmings folks.  When I hear someone like Andrew, all distraught that Toronto is stealing all his friends, it makes me understand why it has such a lure, and why some people, such as Andrew and myself, aren't drawn to it like bugs to a bug zapper.  If you live in a city like Ottawa and are a young professional, where in the world are you going to meet interesting people in your same age range? You're past the age for school, you're not old enough to be meeting people at your retirement home... so where do you meet people? Work. And if you work in a city like Toronto, there are so many more opportunities to make large circles of friends who are you age, and in a similar situation and position. And so why aren't Andrew and I drawn to the wonder that is Toronto? Two words folks: Significant Others. When you're happy in a relationship the need to meet large groups of people diminishes, cause half of the point of meeting large groups of people when you're single is to meet eligible singles.  So thanks to the brilliance of the McCarthy Tétrault rep I understand. Now all I need is a job at their Toronto office.

      It's Tuesday folks! Headnotes is published, and here I am.... getting laughed at once again.  I got this new job, you see. The official title is "Computer Assistant". Really, I sit in the computer lab, catch up on my readings, and then when that's done I kill some time on Messenger and I blog a little. AND I get paid for it.  Sounds like a beautiful job, doesn't it? Sit around, catching up on school work, killing time, waiting for questions that never come...  But wait, it's not all smiles and flowers folks. I get to wear this nice little nametag. It's homemade. It says "Sara, Computer Assistant". So here I am, in a room full of my peers, with a label like that proudly on my chest. GREAT. Every time one of my friends walks in, what happens? I get laughed at. The worst part,  its a small school . I know probably about 80% of the people that walk through these doors.  I've never been laughed at so much in my life . I might as well be wearing a gorilla suit and dancing around outside the law school. But don't feel bad for me, the laughs will eventually subside, even if it takes force!! I'm sure this is one of those growth experiences that will make me a better person... or at least I hope so.

      Well, you can all thank Andrew for this. Yep, he's gotten me started. I guess it wouldn't be fair to place complete blame on Andrew for this, boredom at my new job is definitely a contributing factor, but if you need someone to blame then Andrew is your man for sure.  So, for those of you who don't get enough of me every Monday in  urlLink  Headnotes  , here is a chance to catch me probably every Tuesday here at my Blog. So, enjoy, or don't... if you feel you're getting stupider each and every time you read what I have to say, don't worry, you're probably right!

      It appears Andrew Limmert has disappeared. I'm slightly worried as to where he might have gone. He hasn't been on messenger, and no blogs since Friday. It's quite perplexing and unlike him. Maybe the geese got him!!!!

      Okay, Guns 'N Roses is coming to London, Ontario. I've finally found an advantage to being in Windsor, besides law school, meeting Scott and living away from home. It's only a 1.5 hour drive to London to see   AXL ROSE!!        Ah... there's Axl, on the September 2002 cover of Spin Magazine. And that is just proof, Axl Rose is still hot... even if he is "washed up" Axl as opposed to "It's 1990 and I'm the sexiest man on earth but I'm married to a supermodel" Axl.  Its 2002 and Guns N Roses is back... and Axl doesn't have an unsightly beer belly.. If only we could bring Milli (or was it Vanilli?) back from the grave, my sad, sad 90's existence would be realized. Maybe Axl will notice me at the concert, and tell me how he's loved me all these years and how he wants me to quit law school, run away on tour with him and be a drugged out groupie. Who knows... maybe he's reading this blog right now!!! I better go 80's up my hair!!!

I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren't for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can't stay out of trouble.  What Video Game Character Are You?

      Okay, well although I have nothing interesting to say... Someone does.        I taste like  Peanut Butter .   I am one of the most blendable flavours; I go with sweet, I go with sour, I go with bland, I go with anything. I am practical and good company, but have something of a tendency to hang around when I'm not wanted, unaware that my presence is not welcome.  What Flavour Are You?      I was looking at Andrew's site and found out what flavour I am. No matter what I did I was always peanut butter. So, figure out what flavour you are too.

       A Modest Retort to Allison's Preposterous Blog.    As much as I can't wait to hear the laughs as Allison's poor little future son walks down the street in his frilly pink frock, and as much as I generally oppose stereotypes of any kind, pink is not a colour for a man! May I point your attention to the episode of Friends with Ross and his pink (sorry, "salmon") shirt, and the social stigma that was placed on him for it? Despite the ever so "Macho" Randy Savage's frequent adornment in a very nice neon shade of pink, pink is simply not a masculine colour, nor will it ever be!  Do we need to "end the narrow minded view of this classic colour", as Allison so nobly is attempting? I say HELL NO!!!!  Keep pink as a gender stereotyped colour! Do we need to allow men to wear skirts, as well, without being tormented and ridiculed? Are men going to start wearing frilly lace panties next? What about lipstick, makeup and bras? Being a girl has few advantages, and one of them is the freedom to wear as much pink as you like! Do we want to give this right away? HELL NO! My father doesn't wear pink, and I'm proud of it!  As a wise person on Miami Vice once said "real men don't wear pink, and when they do, they pack a gun!"   PS: If your father can't even stand up to Jan to stop the pink and mauve from invading his room, how could he kick my dad's ass?  I think its clear that my dad could kick your dads ass any day of the week!!!

      Well, I'm not working today. But, cause I know Andrew waits for Tuesdays with growing anticipation, I'm going to post today. Last time I felt like ranting about my crazy ex. This week, with him a safe distance away and no further incidents between us I'm feeling in a nicer mood. So instead of that, I'm going to write about what's making me happy today.  Last night Scott got possession of his new apartment! It's AWESOME! It's in this older building, with total character. When you first walk in there's a little hallway, with a very deep hall closet. Right after that is a very nice sized living room. It's got this little stained-ish glass window when you first come in, and we're in the process of painting the walls a really nice shade of blue-grey. It's called faded denim. Right where the little window is there's a little nook, where he's going to put his computer desk.  It's just the perfect size. The unfortunate part is the wall is wood pannelling, which he's painting over. Scott says is going to look great, but I'm not so sure yet. The whole place has hardwood floors.  The living room has 4 other big windows in it, so it's full of light. The kitchen is pretty small, but it's got a nice eating area attached to it. And it has these cool glass shelves, and a little semi-opague glass window going into it.  The bathroom is slightly quirky. There is not a lot of room between the toilet and the bathtub, so its best to sit sideways on the toilet. Scott wants to paint the bathroom a sunny yellow colour, so he got a yellow and blue sun and moon shower curtain. The bedroom is at the very end of the apartment. It's a good size too, with a very deep closet and a big window. It's painted a peptobismal kinda pink, so that'll be changed. I kinda like it, but I guess for a boy, living in a pink room isn't so cool... well unless you're Alli's dad. Anyways, it has so much potential and its so much more interesting than my boring, everyone gets the same colour carpeting and walls, Boardwalk apartment.  Some day I'll have a house in which I won't be forced to have "Boardwalk Grey" carpeting... I guess it could be worse, could be ugly green shag.

      CANADIANS TO LEAD WEAPONS INSPECTION TEAM INTO USA     November 21, 2002    (Toronto) A coalition of Canadian peace groups today announced their intention to send an international team of volunteer weapons inspectors into the United States later this winter. The coalition, Rooting Out Evil, are recruiting inspectors through their newly launched website, www.rootingoutevil.org.    "Our action has been inspired by none other than George W. Bush," said Christy Ferguson, a spokesperson for the group. "The Bush administration has repeatedly declared that the most dangerous rogue nations are those that:    1) have massive stockpiles of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons;  2) ignore due process at the United Nations;  3) refuse to sign and honour international treaties; and   4) have come to power through illegitimate means.     "On the basis of President Bush's guidelines, it is clear that the current U.S. administration poses a great threat to global security," said Ferguson. "We're following Bush's lead and demanding that the U.S. grant our inspectors immediate and unfettered access to any site in the country including all presidential compounds so that we can identify the weapons of mass destruction in this rogue state," added David Langille.    Visitors to Rooting Out Evil's website are invited to sign on as honorary members of the weapons inspection team. Honorary inspectors can participate in the action, or they can simply lend the support of their name as they would on a petition. The actual inspection team that crosses the border will be comprised of prominent individuals from Canada and other countries.    The Rooting Out Evil coalition includes Greenpeace Canada, the Centre for Social Justice, and the Toronto Committee Against War and Sanctions on Iraq, and is supported by American groups such as the National Network to End the War Against Iraq, Global Exchange and the US section of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. They oppose the development, storage, and use of weapons of mass destruction by any state.

       The Story of Steve and the mystery Pug    So yesterday I was in at the clinic, going about my Monday duty of assessing legal issues, teaching first years and generally saving the world. It was busy, as it always is when an office designed for no more than 10 is filled up with  20 eager yet new caseworkers, the office staff, lawyers, clients and, of course, as is the norm, their screaming children. So we're busy bustling about, saving the world one criminal charge at a time, when I look out our window (which, strangely enough, is bulletproof), to see someone from my group, Steve, playing with one small rambunctious Pug. Well, the office apparently wasn't chaos enough, so Steve brings the Pug in and locks him in the small intake room, so now, on top of the whirl of activity, the cry of random children, the happy sounds of the paper shredder and the incessant ring of the phone, we now have the delighted barking of one wayward Pug. Well I love chaos, so I'm all cool with this, and soon the Pug is running wild around the office being fed parts of peoples brown bag lunch sandwiches and drinking water from a mystery bowl found in the bathroom, much to the dismay of the two older-wiser lawyers. This doesn't contribute much to the professional image we attempt to portray. However, our clients screaming kids don't seem to mind watching the wayward Pug, by this point full of sandwiches, chase his back foot around the office. At this point, the office, filled with the smell of unwashed dog, decides the Pug should be called "Buddy". Steve decides he loves Buddy and is going to take Buddy to Pet Smart, spend $200 on Pug-accessories, and keep Buddy as his very own. All the lawyerlings, clients, office staff and very relieved older-wiser lawyers wave Buddy off on his journey to PetSmart and eventually his new home with Steve.    Catastrophe hits this morning.   One poster of three very sad children cuddling with Buddy appears all over campus. Buddy was not a homeless Pug, but merely went for a stroll without informing his three small child owners.    Problem: It appears Steve loves Buddy. Steve does not want to give up his new friend.This story is still in progress... at this point, to recap:   One wayward Pug. Two happy roommates with a new friend. Three small children, very sad. And an office full of lawyerlings, waiting to see what happens with their new mascot.    I'll keep you posted.

      I found some 15 year old girls blog. It's pretty good, and strangely I'm addicted. I'm finally over my Survivor addiction and what comes along? Some kid with a blog and Joe Millionaire. Will reality TV never cease? At least Joe Millionaire is kind of getting old. What girl is actually going to say "Oh, I thought you were a millionaire, nevermind construction boy, you're dumped!" on national TV? Hell, she'll wait til AFTER the show, and we'll miss all the good shit. Nobody is THAT oblivious to what "shallow" means. And the people who WERE that oblivious got voted off early. It's gonna be a sappy "Oh I don't care that you have no money Evan, I love you anyway" boo hoo wah wah wah.  Some exercise in human behaviour. Maybe if these ladies didn't KNOW they were on TV it'd be different.  So, back to  urlLink Merel's blog . Wonder where she's from. Wonder if she's secretly a  poor destitute construction worker, sucking people in through her blog. If she is i'll be so pissed I'll never read again! I swear.

      Okay, rethinking it a little, Allison is right! We're not going to rot in hell.. and it wasn't even a dump, cause you can't dump someone that you're  not dating. It was merely me, opening his eyes to the fact that ALLISON  DIDN'T LIKE HIM. And the impersonating part was okay cause she was listening, and I had permission! Right. Not rotting in hell. Thats a load off my mind... phew!

      thinking about it a little more... it was probably even doubly wrong since we did it over the phone! Hmmm...  I'm a horrible human being. Figure I'll rot in hell for this one?

      So Allison has asked the all important question: Is it wrong for your roomate to dump someone for you. Answer: Hell yes, for both the dumper and the roommate! I admit, yes... I dumped someone for her. Yes... it was probably a stupid thing for us to do. But I pretended to be her... which I realise is a criminal offence probably...  so yes, yes yes yes it's wrong.  But she really didn't want to do it... and I don't know the guy, so it was easy, and he thought it was her... so he's none the wiser (unless he reads my blog, which would be creepy). So not only did I dump  the dude, I also lied to him, which is doubly wrong. But I did have her permission to impersonate her... and also  I did a damn crappy job of sounding anything like her, and he didn't even know! So maybe it's HIS fault for being a dumbass.. but then again, like he was thinking "Gee, I bet this isn't REALLY Allison"... I was pretty hard on the dude... but he started to pull the "well lets not break up crap"... which I think is really shitty for a guy to do, just for the record. I mean it takes a hell of alot of guts to  work up the nerve to actually dump someone... and then to try and talk them out of it when they're already struggling??? No way! Not cool!!! If they're dumping you just have the class to take it like a man, or a woman, or whatever you are... then there wouldn't be the NEED for someone to get their roommate to dump someone for them.  But that's just me trying to make excuses. Yes it was wrong. No, we are not in grade 4. Yes, we are  dumb... So in answer to your question Allison, yeah, it was stupid and we probably shouldn't have done it... but in the spectrum of offences there are far worse things to do.. like murder, and stuff like that. But it was wrong nonetheless... but if someone thinks I'm wrong and it's not unethical to pretend to be your roommate and dump their boyfriend for them please, do tell...   And PS: Dave Contant, if you are reading this I do use the word dude too much. You're right. New Years Resolution: Cut back on my overuse of the word dude.

      It's been so long since I last blogged that I don't know what to blog. Andrew reminded me today that in fact, I have a blog. Good thing too, or else I would have been like Henley. Henley is in the Dominican Republic right now... I almost forgot. I bet Tara got a sunburn, but that's besides the point. Actually, I don't think there is a point really... now is there? Allison wrote a funny poem on her blog that I just noticed today. It's been there for awhile, but I forgot blogs existed...  This was after she saved my drunken, puking, muttering ass from cold death on Jon's bathroom floor. Along with Andrew, who also saved my blog. But who will save Henley's blog? I wondered why I hadn't seen him on Messenger in awhile. Thought maybe he was stuck in Jon's bathroom.  Some guy came to our door this morning. He was tall and scary and said he was from the cable company. He was here to cut off our cable. I thought Allison was going to puke on him. We were baffled. I paid the cable bill, no one called to cancel cable. What's this random guy doing here? He certainly didn't look like he was from the cable company, what with his misplaced earring and his questionable choice of cable repairman clothing. He wasn't sure why he was cutting off our cable, he just was. The cable company wasn't sure why they were cutting off our cable either, since they owed us money. Maybe we should be cutting off THEIR cable. Turns out our cable doesn't need to be cut off. Good for us, responsible, up-to-date bill payers that we are. I wonder if the cable company will give me interest on the money they owe me.

      Well it's been awhile since I've blogged, as Andrew has just reminded me. And so, while I'm sitting here bored I figured it'd be a good opportunity to catch up. So HELLO to all my avid readers... I wonder if I actually have any of those other than Andrew and Allison... So what's new... I'm excited. I got an awesome call for an interview today, with the CROWN ATTORNEY'S office! I would LOVE to be a Crown. Hell first off, my job title is CAPITALIZED! You know you're  important when you're capitalized. Second of all I would be keeping the streets safe, and making sure justice was maintained! I would be a very important cog in the justice system! Maybe even more than a cog! Maybe like, a lever or a crank or something! But at least a really BIG cog. It just seems like what I want to do... but I guess I gotta pass the interview first! Still wonder if I'd much rather be at summer camp... swimming and boating and waterskiing... sounds like more fun than being a cog, even a really big cog.

      After a conversation last night about spontaneous diarrhea and defecating, here is a little blurb about "the brown noise" for the non believers.  Brown noise is a slang term for a subsonic frequency  between 10.5 and 16 Hz, below the audible spectrum  that causes human beings to spontaneously vomit and to lose bowel control. (According to profane TV cartoon South Park, this frequency is believed to be 92 cents below E flat. In one episode, a stadium full of children playing this note on recorders caused worldwide gastrointestinal distress. Funny!) Brown noise, which is apparently difficult to generate, is allegedly being investigated for military and crowd-control purposes. What a weapon that would be! Youre just casually walking through the DMZ and boom! There you go.  Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla (an eccentric genius whose biography is definitely worth reading!) came upon a brown noise phenomenon when developing his electrotherapeutic machine, which flooded the human body with electrical currents and strong vibrations, intended to soothe aches and promote healing. The device induced a bout of spontaneous diarrhea in his friend Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain), and legend has it that Tesla then began to use brown noise to hasten the, er, evacuation of uninvited guests.   And here is a more scientific, less South Park oriented explanation:  Acoustic, Infrasound. Very low-frequency sound which can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and vehicles. Transmission of long wavelength sound creates biophysical effects; nausea, loss of bowels, disorientation, vomiting, potential internal organ damage or death may occur. Superior to ultrasound because it is "in band" meaning that its does not lose its properties when it changes mediums such as from air to tissue. By 1972 an infrasound generator had been built in France which generated waves at 7 hertz. When activated it made the people in range sick for hours [23,302,546].

      United States changes it's name to "Coallition" BAGHDAD, IRAQ (WI)  In a move to convince the world that they are not going it alone, the United States Congress has quickly amended the U.S. Constitution and changed the superpower's name to "Coalition". Almost immediately after the emergency congressional name-changing session, "Coalition" forces began bombing targets in Southern Iraq and outside Baghdad.  Additionally, two stars have been added to the new United States of Coalition flag, representing Britain and Spain. The two new stars are smaller and less prominent than the other 50, as these new states have no autonomy and must rely completely on the President for decision making.  Following the bombing, one of the Saddam Husseins spoke before the Iraqi people denouncing the Coalition attack. CIA video analysts believe that the speech was probably given by Saddam #4, though one source told reporters that it could have been Saddam #12 with a cold.  At a late morning press conference, Donald Rumsfeld pretended to answer questions about the attack and the impending invasion in his usual, warm manner.  "I'm not telling you fucking reporters a thing--just who do you think you are?" the Defense Secretary barked. "You'll get the news when I damn well feel like it, and not a minute before. If you don't like it you can move back to Old Europe or whatever pussy country your parents came from. Thank you and good morning."  --taken from www.wackyiraqi.com

      I can hear them praying in Baghdad. They're showing it on the news. It's dark, there are few lights, and all you can hear is the chanting of prayers. I don't know if I would still believe in God if I was in their shoes today. One American Marine died today. I wonder how many innocent Iraqi's met their ends today? Nobody seems to report that. The B52s or on their way. They left England, headed for Baghdad. It really makes me feel ill. I really hope their prayers work.

      I guess Jean Chretien best summed up this war yesterday when he said the war was not justified and "that we can't just go blowing up every country that has a government that we don't agree with. Where would we draw the line?"  And he's right... where would we draw the line. Is this really a war about a country who will inevitably have weapons of mass destruction? Well, if it is, why aren't they blowing up Korea? Jean Chretien even feels, as do others, that given a few weeks Saddam Hussein would be in full compliance with U.N Security council measures... so our alternatives are give them two weeks, or shoot first ask questions later. President Bush's main reason for acting now, rather than waiting two weeks is based on a "look what happened when we appeased Hitler" point of view. Ladies and gentleman, this is no Hitler. Iraq is a destitute bombed out country. The US could crush them like a bug just as easily in two weeks... unless the Nuclear Weapons Fairy comes by and puts an arsenal under Saddam's pillow next week or something...  So lets blow up some innocent people to try and force democracy down their throats. Is forcing democracy on someone that we think should be democratic really democracy? Especially when the US will inevitably pick at the very least the pool of potential candidates for leader? (ie. someone US friendly who wants to sell cheap oil?) Doesn't seem like a good outcome. Does the US have such a great track record of being a good judge of character? Hell.. they gave weapons to Saddam, Osama, Pinnochet...  I find it very telling that in his public address Monday night President Bush specifically said, to the Iraqi people "Don't burn your oil wells". Hmmm.... another war about oil? Anyway, I found a poem that better sums up how I'm thinking than I do... so here it is. Taken from the Windsor Lance, and sung to the tune of "If you're happy and you know it"  If you cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq If the markets are a drama, bomb Iraq If the terrorists are frisky, Pakistan is looking shifty, North Korea is too risky, Bomb Iraq  If we have no allies with us, bomb Iraq. If we think someone has dissed us, bomb Iraq. So to hell with the inspections Let's look tough for the elections Close your mind and take directions, Bomb Iraq.  It's pre-emptive non agression, bomb Iraq Let's prevent this mass destruction, bomb Iraq They've got weapons we can't see, And that's good enough for me. 'Cuz it's all the proof I need. Bomb Iraq.  If you never were elected, bomb Iraq. If your mood is quite dejected, bomb Iraq If you think Saddam's gone mad, With the weapons that he had, and he tried to kill your dad! Bomb Iraq  Fall in line and follow orders, bomb Iraq. For our might knows not our borders, bomb Iraq Disagree? We'll call it treason! Let's make war, not love this season Do we really need a reason? Bomb Iraq

      Well, I made a  urlLink new radio station.  It plays an ecclectic mix of Jaheim, U2, Nelly, Zwan... but for the life of me I can't make it play Dave Matthews Band. So we'll see.. I don't know that a station that doesn't play any DMB is fit to exist.. It tried to play me some Luther Vandross this morning. I stopped that real quick.  Anyway, feel free to check it out, but be warned, it is craptacular.  NOTE: Well I just made it play Dave Matthews band I think... it was called "Adult Alternative"... which makes me think of like, midget porn or something... but,  apparently it means Dave Matthews.

      A true story from the Laskin Moot Once upon a time at Windsor Law there was a team of mooters, picked from among many great students. These students came to be chosen as the Laskin Moot team. The Laskin Moot was a competition where law students from all over travelled to a distant land, known as Toronto. Well, the Windsor Law team was no exception. They hopped on a VIA Rail train and were off on their journey, factums in hand, with high hopes and heads full of knowledge. The day passed, and the four brave mooters arrived at their destination. However, one of the mooters began to feel nervous, and uneasy. In fact, this mooter was feeling quite ill!  He cursed his luck for the bad fortune that had brought him to be ill, just before the big day! He cursed and cursed, until finally he took a glance towards the ground. Thats when he noticed something odd about his shoes they did not match! In fact, the brave mooter had travelled all this way to the big moot with mismatched shoes  Moral of the Story: If the shoe fits, double check before you wear it.

      Well, it's almost Easter.... so consider this my Easter card to everyone... enjoy.   MAN ASSAULTS EASTER BUNNY   WAUSAU, Wis .  The Easter Bunny at a mall in Wausau, Wis., could have used the help of McGruff the Crime Dog when an unknown man jumped him in front of a gathering of children.  Travis Peterson, 29, dressed as the Easter Bunny at the Wausau Center Mall, said he was greeting kids Saturday when an apparently drunk man hopped into his lap, wrapped his arm around his neck in a headlock and punched him three times in the mouth.   "I was just sitting there in my chair, waving to the kids, and he came up and jumped in my lap and just started hitting my head," the Bunny told the local Wausau Daily Herald.  The suspect, whom police identified as 21-year-old Montell T. Howard, fled as shocked children looked on.  Howard was nabbed Monday afternoon when mall security caught sight of him returning to the shopping center, the Herald reported. Peterson, still in Easter Bunny gear, positively identified Howard as the man who had assaulted him, according to the paper.  Police arrested him for disorderly conduct; he was later released from jail.  The Easter Bunny said he smelled alcohol on his assailant's breath and suspected he was trying to show off for friends, according to the Herald.  "Even if he wasn't trying to harm me, he chattered my teeth pretty good," Peterson said. "It was totally uncalled for, and he did it in front of a bunch of kids."  Authorities said the fluffy, well-padded bunny outfit protected Peterson from significant injury.  "Because of the bunny suit, (the victim) didn't get hurt, but it was unusual to get hit this way," police officer Chang Lee wrote in a report of Saturday's incident.  But Peterson said he is still feeling some physical effects of the attack.  "Little fragments of (paint from) the bunny's eye got into my eye, and it's kind of irritating right now," he said.

      I found this on a link off of a website, and I haven't stopped laughing since.   Diary of a Cereal Mascot  Dear Diary,  I hate those fucking kids.  I swear to God, whoever it was that made it illegal for cartoon animals to purchase breakfast cereal should be dragged into the desert by his balls and shot in the face. I take a lot of shit from people - they call me an addict, they say I don't care about anything but that sweet, sweet cereal, they publicly mock me. I'm tired of it, and I'm tired of those goddamned kids.   You'd think that the little bastards would maybe have even the distant cousin of an altruistic streak, or perhaps they might have been exposed to the revolutionary concept of sharing. But no. Instead, they stand there, self-satisfiedly chomping that cereal which by all rights, on effort alone, should be mine, and spit their maxims as would a schoolmarm. Well, I'll show those little scrotum-blisters one day. Mark my words. I'll show them all. They're so fucking lucky that a cartoon animal can't buy a handgun in this country, either.  I just haven't hit on the right plan yet. I've disguised myself as any number of things and they have usually been fooled at first, but there is always a fatal flaw, one I've overlooked, that proves my undoing. This week I might perhaps disguise myself as a policeman, insisting that they allow me to expect their cereal boxes. When I disguised myself as a doddering grandmother, I actually got my hand - for one fleeting, glorious moment - inside the cereal box! I remember that day as though it were yesterday - and I also remember how I spent the better part of that week snuffling at my hand, inhaling the heavenly scent of cereal until the aroma faded. And oh, how I miss it now.  I am now thinking of the cereal again. I promised myself I would not. And now look at me - just a slavering beast, weeping for what he has not. I hate cereal for what it has done to me. And yet I love it so.  God, I'm glad my sponsor at Sugary Breakfast Addicts Anonymous can't see me now. I've failed them. I've failed everyone.  My hand is shaking too much. I need to stop writing.  O God, help me.  The cereal. I...God help me.

In fact, he said it's the worst blog ever. He feels cheated, as you promised "News, Commentary, Humour and Weather at 11".

        Oww my face Hurts   After a wonderful weekend of camping with Henley, Blah, Heather, Mark and Scott... and watching the Snow birds fly over Leamington to the tune of "Rock me Like a Hurricane"... I have come to remember something I once referred to as a "sunburn". Yes, I do seem to remember this. So, we're breaking out the Solarcaine and the Aloe and hoping it fades to a wonderful tan by the time the job interview rolls around. On the bright side, however, I can get embarassed all I want and not worry about blushing what with the lovely shade of red my face already is. And I feel for Blah... if my sunburn is a 6.5/7 on a scale of one to ten, Blah's is a 17.

      Things that happened to me today  1) I found the best chicken sandwich in Windsor, at Patty O'Ryan's pub. I never would have expected it. It's right near court too. Basil Court look out...   2) I found out a good friend of mine is going to be a daddy.   3) In related news, I found out the pill is not 100% effective, even when taken properly. Now, I am frightened. I'm hoping my good friend's girlfriend is illterate or took some kind of "birth control antedote" that was the cause of this...  4) On Friday I had this conversation with Carolyn, (who will be quite upset I reffered to her on my blog), who thinks blogs are creepy and that posting personal details about oneself on the web cannot lead to anything positive. In fact, it might lead to stalking and scariness because how many people, with my name, can there be attending law school in Windsor? Probably not too many. Then today, someone reading my blog emailed me, and I was kind of frightened that maybe I was being stalked... but it turns out there's no scariness going on. But, I'll admit I was a little frightened for about a second... maybe less.   5) I've taken up running. Last night there were very scary carnies down by the river, where I run. There were also fireworks. That kind of offset the carnies. Tonight I'm betting there won't be fireworks, but there will be carnies. I'm thinking about not running.     So yeah, that's my day...

      After a(nother) rough day down at the Ontario Court of Justice, I came home to a pleasant surprise. I found it on Blah's Blog. Here's whatcha gotta do:   1. Go to www.google.com  2. Type weapons of mass destruction in the search box thingy (yes, that is the technical term) 3. Hit "I'm feeling Lucky" 4. Laugh your ass off  On the topics of asses, and in slightly more disturbing news, Kieran apparently has a hairy ass. From what he's said in his blog it sounds almost yeti-like in appearance. I'm wondering if perhaps he is none other than the yeti that lives upstairs from me! It must be true.. I mean, nobody is REALLY from Alberta and admits it!  In other news, I had a very pleasant conversation with the dude at the sushi bar today at lunch, and believe that they might be able to throw a person in jail for parking tickets in the province of Quebec. This might be something I expected in slightly more suspicious, dodgy provinces (read: Alberta). I have added "Parking in Quebec" right alongside "ever having sex with anyone again" on my list of things probably best to be avoided. The Sushi dude hates London Ontario though, and he's actually lived there. I'm starting to wonder how I'm going to like living in "the substandard" London.  I would also like to make mention that my friend Matt Willson has started a blog. He's in Scotland, so it's bound to be interesting! It's great how well travelled so many people, past and present, in my life are becoming, and it's great for me because in this period of my life where I'm currently landlocked, at least I get to read the adventures of others, currently living life to the fullest. And fear not, I will not be landlocked for long!   Future plans: 1. Articling at Lerners in London. Despite it being a law firm, they do criminal work and it will allow me 10 months to experience another Canadian city, adding to my list of "places I've sort of lived" 2. VSO! Yes folks, mark my words, VSO needs me! I am going to follow in the paths of other great adventurers and take 2 years to see some part of the world I haven't yet seen.  So, don't worry, some day my exploits will be far more interesting than who in Windsor has a good chicken sandwich, or stupid shit I found on the internet, and even more exciting than the yeti-like ass of Kieran! (On the topic of body hair, being someone who would shave every hair off my body if I could, let me just say "ick"! But, Kieran, I would say a hairy ass isn't as bad as a hairy back or stomach or neck... at least when you swim I'd hope your ass is covered)  So, maybe this is that meaningful post I've been meaning to write for awhile... now that you know my future, here's the update of whats up presently: - Summering in Windsor is fabulous. This town totally transforms in the summer! The riverfront is beautiful, there are festivals every weekend (epicure is this weekend, and Iguana sushi bar will be there), Kim Mitchell comes and plays, camping is not too far away, and there's almost always something exciting to do. I've decided, (please don't kill me Tara) that I'm going to spend next summer doing my bar admission course in Windsor.  - Working at Community Legal Aid is wicked. The cases I'm getting are more challenging, now that I have a little more experience under my belt. They can't get too challenging, since we handle pretty small stuff, but I'm actually in the middle of a two day hearing about whether or not a firearms officer's decision to deny someone the right to permit a firearms license was justified. I've never had a hearing go so long! It's definitely an experience, and I'm taking everything I can from it. I guess, although being a Crown would have ruled, it's probably almost for the best that I came in second... the student there seems to get almost no litigation experience, and when he does they stick him in traffic court. I guess I'm lucky where I am, even if it wasn't choice #1 on my list. - Things with Scott are awesome. We get along great (not a single fight!), the apartment rules (I SO love old apartments), and we're taking our two week vacation to go up to the lake and visit his family in Kingston. He loves the lake almost as much as me, so it's great! We went up for the long weekend and there was a kayak! So, we kayaked and we've both fallen in love with it. But then again, I love anything involving water, so no big surprise! Oh! Also, I got my boaters license, so I can now drive a jet ski should someone decide they wish to give me one... (feel free! Really!) - We haven't been flying lately, but hopefully we'll go flying sometime soon.  - I've decided this summer that it is possible for someone to be so irritating that you want to saw off your own arm and club yourself to death with it. Yes, it truly is possible and it's just a good thing I don't currently have possession of a saw. I'd surely be armless by now. - The cats still don't get along very well, but they haven't eaten each other yet so hopefully they can co-exist.  Other than that, life is continuing along as per usual. Sorry if my update seems scattered, my brain is kind of rattled this evening.  Finally, I'd like to wish Steve (aka Blah) good luck with his new place! Can't wait to come check it out!! Should be good times. (I know you say you miss your mommy but it's a whole new world once you actually get out into it. It'll be a blast, and mommy can visit)  So, that's it for now. Don't expect anything meaningful for quite some time.

      Okay, so I haven't blogged in awhile. A loooooooooong while. So, to summarize July and August, in a few words: Hot Windsor summer, lots of festivals, trips to the lake, frosty beverages, trials, hearings, paperwork, swimming, nude beach, whitewater rafting, mountain climbing, fishing without a license, paradise hotel, walks by the river, thai cuisine, visits to family, detroit in darkness, goodbye to the bar ads kids, flying, camping, algonquin park, changes at work, and now back to school.  Yes, that's right. School started the week before last week... officially. Classes started Monday last week (Guess someone didn't tell my professor's that school started the week before.) A little extra vacation was sure appreciated!  The course list for this semester: Labour Law, Constitutional Litigation, Alternative Dispute Resolution and Wills and Succession Law. Should be interesting enough.  Looking forward to moving to London, it should be nice!   REALLY glad to have lots of people back, although a few key faces are sadly missing. But, a few new ones have showed up, so that's cool too!  Events of the future: Carbolic Smoke Ball, Boat Cruise, Tara is coming to visit, Going to Cedar Point, home for Thanksgiving, the much anticipated Apple Festival and hopefully another camping trip. I'm also signing up tomorrow for a few campus rec. courses...   Wow you'd figure after nearly two months I might have something to say, but nope! Not really!

      Okay, so this person is looking for someone he/she knows named Don. If you know a Don, this may be the Don! So go to the  urlLink  Operation Find Don website   if you know, or think you may know, someone named Don.  After seeing this page, it gave me a little bit of inspiration. I know I probably don't have as big a reader base as this person looking for Don, but I'm looking for someone too: Her name is Kim White. I'm pretty sure Kim is short for Kimberly. She went to school with me at Lakeview Public school and lived in the Bayshore area, specifically on Woodbridge Crescent. She's my age, well actually 25, and her birthday is April 5th, 1978. She also went to D.Aubrey Moodie Intermediate School with me for 2 years, and then moved to somewhere near Toronto. It might have been Orangeville, or it might have been Oakville, I can't quite remember. She may have also ended up in Renfrew living with an aunt of some sort. She has two brothers, Ryan and Chris. Ryan is a year or two older and Chris (I think that's his name) is quite a bit older. Chris has a different last name than White.  She liked Bon Jovi when we were in middle school, but that might have changed. She liked to draw, and write. I can't remember her mom or dad's names, but I do remember that when her mom was a kid she used to call  "Kentucky Fried Chicken" "Fucky Fried Chicken". How that's relevant, I'm not quite sure. Wow this is alot of inane information that will probably not help me find anyone, but I'm curious to see if it'd work.  So, if you know Kim White let me know. If this works, I'll never doubt the magical powers of the internet again.

      Okay, so I've been surfing the web a little more lately, now that Allison has started posting again, and so has Blah (I note, however, that Henley's blog is still pathetic), and Amber has started a blog, Drew is back blogging a little more, and apparently so am I... but, in my searches through the Tiki World that this Tiki Head website has led me to, I found a site, called  urlLink  Bad Tiki  , which I'm finding quite hilarious. (Allison, be warned, if you're thinkin about checking it out they accuse Anne Geddes, who I know you love, of potential evildoing!!!) Anyhow, it's my laugh lately so I figured I'd let everyone know. And on that note, I'm off to class to continue to learn how to write a will.

      A few interesting things happened on my blog over the weekend: 1) AMBER SIGNED MY GUESTBOOK! What does this mean, you might ask? It means my long lost friend is still alive, and somewhere out west (she might be in Calgary still and just forget where it goes on the map) and has found my web site! So, AMBER! If you're reading this, drop me an email or SOMETHING! I miss ya!  2) As I was searching my guestmap for clues as to the location of Amber I noticed that one of the people who signed my blog was in fact a real person, and not just one of my friends pretending to be someone else. He/She (I think it's a he, but I can't quite figure it out) has added a link to my site to their blog, so check out the link I'm adding back to their blog, named Tiki Head. So, Kinot author of Tiki head, if you're out there drop me a line and let me know who you are!  Additional notes for the day: Alternative Dispute resolution SUCKS, luckily Scott can manufacture car parts from what he finds in his trunk or else I'd be in Brighton, Noseplugs are beneficial when kayaking, turkey is gobblerific, Thanksgiving brings out the bitchiness in certain people, hot-tubs RULE, and Ottawa to Windsor in 12 hours = bad.  One more special note to Allison, who is probably just ariving and settling in at her new job in Chicago!!!!!! Congratulations and hope you're having a Chicago-rific time.

      Okay, so after reading Drew, Mike and Matt's blogs and realising that my musical tastes could use a little expanding I've decided to listen to a little band they call "Metric", and wow! The voice is incredible, the energy is great, it's just all-around great music! They kind of remind me of a more upbeat version of Garbage... who I used to love. Also, after realising that sometimes good background music is essential to any gathering, Scott has taken to downloading jazz. GREAT background music. In fact, it's been sort of an artistic weekend. Tara came to visit, and we ended up going to Chanoso's... Windsor's kinda-trendy, kinda-pseudo-ethnic (but not one particular ethnicity) stir fry restaurant, where it appears fortune was smiling upon us. We were offered 4 free tickets to see opening night of the live play version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, being put on at the Capitol Theatre. So, off we went to fifth row seats to witness lingerie clad men and a the only play I've ever been to where the audience screams at the actors... It was actually a REALLY good version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show... not that I've ever really been a big fan, but the singing and the acting and the costumes were all very good. Very Rocky Horror for sure. I also have had the opportunity lately to go to a live performance of a local band called the Shannon brothers. I know the singer from the local law scene, and even though I'm not typically into celtic music I figured "Hey, why not broaden my horizons and check this out" and it was pretty good... very much like going to see the "Boy Scout's" play Gracey's back in Ottawa. But, I have to say that after all is said and done, despite all this horizon broadening and new and diverse stuff I will be very happy when I get my hands on Dave Matthews new solo album, "Some Devil" (It's been sold out for awhile now)... what can I say, old habits die hard.  Otherwise things in Windsor remain more or less the same: Scott and I volunteered on the successful liberal campaign for our local liberal MPP this past week, that was good times. Tara came through Windsor on her whirlwind tour of 401 towns from Ottawa to Windsor. Checked out the ever-sketchy areas in Detroit, the local Windsor nitelife, and ended it all off with brunch... not quite breakfast, not quite lunch, and it came with a slice of canteloupe at the end... and a verbal onslaught by our (very cute, in a boyband kinda way) waiter.  And for those of you in or around the National Capital Region, keep next weekend open cause I'm coming home for some turkey!!!! YAY turkey! Gobble Gobble!

      I would like to nominate Henley's blog as the WORST BLOG EVER! It's been the same damn thing for a year. NOTHING. Therefore, I hereby proclaim by the power vested in me, that Henley's Blog is officially "The SUCKIEST BLOG OF ALL TIME!" I believe Allison will back me up on this as well.  Also, I'm worried about Kieran. He appears to have disapeared after his last encounter in his giant Jesus balloon. Kieran, if you're out there somewhere send me a sign!

      Welcome to 2004 everyone. Hope everyone is having a wonderful year. I realise I haven't posted in quite some time, and I probably won't for quite some time in the future. What can I say, I'm just bad at internet journalism. I found a website that had a list of 101 things to do in 1001 days, so I've been working on that and will put it up shortly. And yes, Henley, ordering a veggie burger with bacon is on the list of things to do.  Speaking of Henley, who will be a father in only a matter of hours at this point, although his blog sucks his band rawks (apparently bad spelling is cool, kids!). So, I've added a link to his band Problematic's web page. Check them out. You can also see pictures of Henley with his new do.  Other than that, life continues as per usual with the sole exception of the addition of a new car. Definitely makes transportation during this cold snap much more enjoyable, let me tell you!

      Looks like Scott and I will be attending the wedding herinafter to be known as the Sigfried and Garfunkle wedding in West Palm Beach, Florida later in the year. May to be precise. It should be a good way to spend a weekend... not as good as hiding alcohol and fireworks from the good folks at Wheatley provincial park, unless Garfunkle's uncle prohibits drinking which would add the element of excitement I'm seeking. Blah, if you come I am personally ensuring you wear sunscreen! Your poor nose!

      So Google has this new thing called Orkut, where you invite your friends to join an online social network. It really smacks of the old Friendster concept, which never really seemed to catch on. The difference with Orkut? You can only join if you're invited by a friend. An added eliteness, one might venture. Also a good way to keep out the riff-raff, and spambots and the like.  Apparently a journalist for the New Yorker wrote about it, and seeing as how the media knows what is cool and what isn't, Orkut might be the next big thing. Personally, I haven't seen what all the hype is about since it appears the Orkut train hasn't hit my circle of friends yet... appears we aren't trendy or hip enough as of yet, or I guess more accurately just not plugged in enough to the online community to join the elite Orkut-ites... or if "we" are, no one has let me in on the fun yet.  As for what exactly Orkut does, I can't comment as I've never been there, but a little web search revealed it has such exciting and hip chat groups as "Fly Chicks for the Geeky Guy", "G-Spot Expedition" and of course the ever popular geek-cult-classic "All Your Base are Belong to Us". Apparently there's also a bit of a 1984 flavour in that people are randomly erased for alleged crimes against Orkut... big brother truly does appear to be watching in Orkut-land.  So is Orkut the next big thing? I guess only time will tell...

      It appears I might have misunderstood Mike's viewpoint, and Mike I apologize for possibly mis-interpreting.  urlLink  Mike  has responded to my most recent post, with additional, more personal reasons for his distaste for all-inclusive type resorts. Let me add, that after reading Mike's travel exploits on his blog and via email I should have known his preference for adventure rather than all you can drink and bland food. (Not that the concept of all you can drink isn't a GREAT idea. Bar's should take this one and run with it!) Also, let me add that I agree with his reasons... I cringe at the "Cruise Ship" idea myself! Why would you want to be on a boat when there's so much cool stuff to see. Seems like a waste to me.   I also agree that there are travel experiences that you have to do while you're young, otherwise your old legs won't be able to carry you. I seriously doubt I'll want to be roughing it and doing a stint in Africa when I'm 60... or even 50. And although I don't like to think I'm declining into decrepitude, as Mike so eloquently puts it, I guess the reality is at 25 I'm halfway to 50... time to get a move on!  On another note, thanks to some urging and editing by my friend Ross, it seems that I've submitted my piece to the newspaper. I guess we'll see if they're interested in what I have to say, and if so you might see my name in print.  And lastly, I hope your knee is feeling better Mike!!

      Well, this post is meant to be a response to Mike Chaiton's most recent post... but, I'm sure it will turn into a ramble of my own opinion, so before I piss of my entire audience know that this is what I believe.  Travel is great, first let me say that I highly encourage Andrew to find a great travel destination and have himself a great experience.  And let me start off by saying this to you, Andrew: I don't think you're too old to have a wild and enhancing experience. However, in Mike's post he mentioned that Andrew should, as one option for travel, go check out a resort in Mexico, for example. I would like to expand on the reasons I personally oppose this suggestion, and why I think that this kind of travel doesn't really accomplish the things that Andrew is seeking, which he says are "adventure, fun, new experiences and culture."  Let me start off by saying I am in no way opposed to travel to places such as Mexico, the Caribbean, Cuba, and those types of developing countries which are the current tourist hotspots. My opposition is to the growing phenomenon of the "all inclusive resort", because of the horrible impact it has on the host countries, its citizens, its environment, and also the negative impact on tourists themselves.  Personally, I could never have "fun" at this type of resort because I don't think I could ever have fun knowing that it was directly and irreparably harming someone else, and making their life worse simply so I can get a tan and hit the beach would make me feel miserable.   Now comes the time when you're screaming: TOURISM PUTS MONEY INTO THESE ECONOMIES! And again, let me remind you that I am, in fact, advocating tourism. Just not the type of un-sustainable tourism that is the current fad. I'm all for tourism and it's huge realm of benefits, however I am a strong advocate of sustainable, responsible travel. If you take nothing away from this post, know that there ARE alternatives to staying in an all-inclusive, foreign owned, negative impact type of resort. You can sit by the pool, soaking up the rays enjoying a beverage without it having a negative impact on the place you're visiting. It's not just all inclusives that have pools, and sun. For those of you who think that your travel to this type of place has a positive impact on the country you are visiting, know that this is only a half truth at best. In fact, there are several NEGATIVE impacts, and although it isn't ALL bad, there are better ways of doing it. Know that if you aren't part of the solution you might just be part of the problem.  So at this point, you're probably asking "Well why is it so bad? I get a nice vacation, the resort gets money, the people who work there get money... Heck I even bring clothes and toilettries for the locals! I'm a good person!"   Most of the reasoning I'm getting comes from UN studies and institutes for responsible tourism, and I'm not going to bother footnoting but if you doubt me and don't feel like doing independent research just email me and I'll send it your way...  Tourism in the form of the all inclusive resort has negative impacts on three major areas of the host country. Economic, Socio-Cultural, and Environmental. All of these go back to the idea that this type of tourism simply isn't implemented in a way that is sustainable.  Socio-Cultural:  Tourism can cause change or loss of local identity and values. What I feel is perhaps the most dangerous in this category is standardization. Destinations risk standardization in the process of satisfying tourists' desires for familiar facilities. While landscape, accommodation, food and drinks, etc., must meet the tourists' desire for the new and unfamiliar, they must at the same time not be too new or strange because few tourists are actually looking for completely new things. Tourists often look for recognizable facilities in an unfamiliar environment, like well-known fast-food restaurants and hotel chains. In other words, the McDonalds invasion is coming and all these beautiful places risk turning from what they have developed into, into Ronald McDonaldland simply because that's what the "rich tourists" want. It's also been shown that many local artisans and crafts-people in fact have been subject to cultural erosion. This happens when people change their products/art from what is traditional to meet consumer (read rich tourist) demands. Through a slow erosion process culture is lost through this commodification of cultural goods. The other part of the socio-cultural impact that bothers me is the view that these developing nations get of "us". We come to their country, don't speak their language, demand things be to our satisfaction, spend insane amounts of money that these people simply don't have... it leaves quite the footprint. These people cannot come visit our country. Generally getting a Visa from a third world nation to come and visit Canada is impossible for most. We simply don't allow them in to visit, and even if we did, they can't afford it.  Finally, in this category, tourism has been shown to lead to child labour, prostitution and crime.  10-15% of the people employed in the third world tourism industry are children. jobs in the tourism sector have working and employment conditions that leave much to be desired: long hours, unstable employment, low pay, little training and poor chances for qualification. Young children are recruited for these jobs because they are cheap and easily influenced.  Young children and women are also influenced into prostitution. It becomes known that tourists bring with them alot of times gifts and money. Tourism also brings consumerism to many parts of the world previously denied access to luxury commodities and services. Although it doesn't cause this exploitation, tourism provides easy access to it and many people's good nature, wishing to give gifts and money to impoverished locals just enables the vicious cycle.  Economic Impact:  The biggest problem in non-sustainable tourism is known as "leakage". Studies show that in a typical Caribbean all inclusive type resort, nearly 95% of tourist dollars do not stay within the country. That means for every $100 dollars spent, the country actually only ever sees $5. Leakage occurs in two ways, import leakage and export leakage. Briefly defined, import leakage is a phenomenon that occurs because most tourists demand products that the host country simply cannot provide. This is especially prevalent in less developed countries, as those countries typically do not have the industry to produce goods and food products that live up to a western tourists standards. Therefore, the money must be spent to import these products from a developed country, putting the money into the economy of that developed country rather than the developing country that so badly needs the income. The second way, export leakage, is again a way in which the money is taken from a developing county's economy, mostly by multinational corporations. The reality is that most local economies in third world countries do not have the capital to invest in building, advertising and investing in tourist facilities. The reality is the majority are foreign owned hotels, and the money does not go to the local economy but rather to the economy of the overseas investors country of origin.  Another negative economic impact is on the residents of the host country itself. Typically, tourists have money. Many cultural and historic sites charge admission fees tailored to the tourist. These fees are typically well outside the scope of what an average local person can afford. This leads to the residents of these countries not being able to afford to visit monuments, ruins, or other venues that are important to their own culture.  Another economic impact of All inclusive tourism is equally detrimental. Local businesses often suffer at the hands of these resorts, as tourists are provided "everything they need" within the resort. There is no reason to leave the resort and put money into local restaurants or off site businesses.   Economic dependence of the local community on tourism can be another negative. Diversification in an economy is a sign of health, however if a country or region becomes dependent for its economic survival upon one industry, it can put major stress upon this industry as well as the people involved to perform well. Many countries, especially developing countries with little ability to explore other resources, have embraced tourism as a way to boost the economy.   In The Gambia, for instance, 30% of the workforce depends directly or indirectly on tourism. In small island developing states, percentages can range from 83% in Cuba to 21% in the Seychelles and 88% in the Dominican Republic, according to the WTO. Over-reliance on tourism, especially mass tourism, carries significant risks to tourism-dependent economies. Economic recession and the impacts of natural disasters such as tropical storms and cyclones as well as changing tourism patterns can have a devastating effect on the local tourism sector.   Another economic negative is the seasonal nature of the jobs created by tourism. This creates problems in that during the off season, families are left with no income.   The Final negative impact of All Inclusive tourism comes on the environment. Many developing nations do not place the same environmental protections on their environments as Canada. Waste is generally not disposed of properly in all inclusive facilities due to lack of infrastructure, landscapes are bulldozed to give easy access to the beach, and in fact there are several species of turtles in the Caribbean area that are nearing extinction due to lack of habitat... the beach resort took over their egg laying grounds. Of course, there is also the issue of pollution... perhaps the best example of that comes from an episode of South Park where there is a Film Festival in South Park. The town becomes overcrowded, and the sewers simply can't take the extra waste. Typically infrastructure in third world countries isn't great, but tourists demand flush toilets and running water in their sinks. Since there is very little money returning to the local economy, this infrastructure simply isn't updated... and lets just say folks that your poop has to go somewhere.   As I said, this has become a rant... But, I guess to sum up, what I'd like to say is that All-Inclusive resort travel isn't responsible. It might be a great way to get a tan, and it might be fun, but there are far better ways to get the goal of "adventure, fun, new experiences and culture" without such a harmful impact. You can have fun in the sun in a responsible manner, even in a third world country. I know adventure travel and roughing it aren't for everyone, but with a little extra time spent researching and maybe a couple extra dollars you can plan a vacation that gives you everything you may want, even if you're looking for sun and surf and a flush toilet. There are several sites online that talk about how to plan a responsible vacation. Try a Lonely Planet guide. You can find great vacation adventures in tropical paradises that don't have all these negative strings attached. You can travel responsibily, taking only pictures and leaving only footprints. It's all just a choice.  You might pay a little more, you might not get a fancy cable TV in your air-conditioned hotel room, but think of what you might save in the long run.

      I've accomplished some things on my list of 101... 1) I read a romance novel. Yes, Tara, it was actually not so bad. 2) I tried Hosenfefer (no idea if thats how you spell it.) Anyway, its made of rabbit which classifies as a meat I've never tried. 3) I went whitewater kayaking. It wasn't on my list, but I ran a class 2/3 (there was some debate) rapid, and it was INCREDIBLE. Thanks Bernie, for lending me your cool boat. I also managed to get a sunburn in overcast April weather. Yay for me. I even managed to pull my first whitewater roll, which was awesome... right in the middle of a rapid. 4) I tried Spetzle, a german dish consisting of weird noodles (which kind of look like turds) and gravy.  Rob has suggested I take up writing menus, which I may consider as a career shift later in life.  Anyway,  its been an eventful weekend/day...

      A couple of things...  I would like to start out by saying that Abdi is wonderful. Just needed to get it off my chest! Secondly, I would like to tell everyone that Broadway Bar and Grill has a breakfast that is made up of almost exclusively meat. You get sausage, bacon and ham, with hashbrowns and toast. Its an artery clogging good time.

      So, I never thought I would be a fan of smog but this week I have noticed a silver lining to the mass pollution in Windsor. Sunsets. Beautiful sunsets that you just wouldn't believe. The sky is regularly bright red or pink or orange or purple.   I've knocked a few things off the list. 13 down, 88 to go. And I keep thinking of things I want to add. For example, I'm going to be Dragon Boating in July. Not something on the list but it should be fun, and it'll raise money for breast cancer research.  Anyway, more some other time folks...

      Despite the chilly weather we've been having, (and by chilly I don't mean as chilly as you guys in Ottawa are having, and I sympathise)summer has officially begun.  Fireworks this week were great... Scott and I went and watched them with a bunch of kids from school. The scary part was that while the fireworks were going off on our side of the river, with over a million people watching, on the other side of the river at Hart Plaza in Detroit 9 people were shot by a gunman. Luckily no one died. I guess he wasn't a very good gunman.   This past weekend Scott and I went camping at Pinery Provincial Park, which was a lot of fun. It's a very nice park, with an absolutely perfect stretch of beach along Lake Huron. No rocks, clean, great sand, and waves. I'm one lake closer to my new goal of swimming in all 5 Great Lakes, and I've also got a new Provincial Park under my belt, which makes me feel like I've accomplished something, even if it's only a small new bit of the world that I've seen.  It was a relaxing weekend; we saw baby raccoons, kayaked, swam, ate food made over the campfire, drank frosty beverages and went on a nature hike by the river. We also stopped at this really cool antique/flea market/mennonite furniture store and picked up a few copies of TIME magazine from the late 70's. Very entertaining stuff. I think our next provincial park to conquer will be one on Lake Superior, so if anyone has been there let me know. Anyhow, I have no burning opinions to get off my chest but I will share with you all a few pictures from Pinery Provincial Park, taken from the mountainous sand dune we climbed, which was right behind our campsite.

      For those of you who may be reading from Barrie... I have an urgent message for you: A vote for Patrick Brown is a vote misspent!  I've recently been reading the Barrie Examiner, filled with dread that one of my past classmates might actually be elected to federal parliament. Frankly, I'm afraid. If Patrick Brown is elected Monday something is seriously wrong with the world, in my opinion.  I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention early on to anyone reading that I am typically categorized by a Liberal supporter. I tend to fall somewhere on the political spectrum between NDP and Liberal, but since I feel my vote goes farther with the grits I usually sway that way.  My problems with Patrick Brown, however, go further than with the Conservative Party in general. Unforuntaly I'm not from Barrie, so all of my news is through the papers and various websites, so I'm not getting a first hand view of the situation as it unfolds. The criticsm going around Barrie right now, however, seems to be that Patrick Brown lacks integrity.... and if the facts are as I've come to understand them, I don't know that I can disagree.  I guess what bothers me most is that Pat's campaign seems to have referred to him as a "non-practicing lawyer". This is where I have quarrel #1. I can confirm that Patrick Brown was in my year at Windsor Law. I believe he graduated. However, in order to use the "L" word in connection with your name, as far as I know, you have to 1) complete the bar admission course. 2)complete 10 months of articling and 3)be called to the bar. It is highly unlikely that Pat has done any of these three in the 2 months since graduation. For those of you who don't know much about the legal profession, and please don't take this as legal advice, in order to call yourself a lawyer you must actually BE a lawyer. In order to call yourself a non-practicing lawyer, you have to actually BE a lawyer first. Calling yourself a lawyer when you aren't is a serious breach of the ethics that law students, articling students and lawyers have to adhere to. Patrick Brown makes a big deal on his website about how Paul Martin may be a criminal and about how criminals should have to serve absurdly long sentences... but it seems to me that if the facts are as I have read, a clever prosecutor might be able to use the false pretences section of the Criminal Code against someone who isn't a lawyer and is claiming to be one to help his or her election campaign. I wonder what kind of sentence THAT would draw in Patrick Brown's ideal world of sentencing.  From my personal knowledge, Pat makes Stockwell Day look like a pacifist, feminist, gay rights activist. That may be going a little far, but Patrick Brown definitely is one of the most small c Conservatives I've had the fortune of meeting. I will confess, however, that listening to Patrick Brown's take on legal ethics in our Legal Profession class certainly was amusing. Let's just say that one day I screamed at him that I wouldn't hire him as my lawyer if he were the only lawyer on earth.  According to Barrie news sources, it appears that Pat won his nomination with the questionable tactic of busing in a group of 14-18 year olds to vote for him. People have spun this in a negative way, but I kind of have to give him kudos for this, if it is true. First, it would appear that such a tactic might inspire youth to take an interest in politics in the future, and bunch of apathetic non-voters that we are in this country, maybe that isn't a bad thing. Pat got involved young and if he creates 10 lifelong voters he's done a good deed (even if they do vote Conservative). Second, it would seem that those 14-17 can't vote, which may strategically hinder him, risking the alienation of older voters despite the support of those too young to vote. Bottom line: Maybe Pat is his own worst enemy, but that serves me just fine.  So, with the election looming upon us, and the political future of the country appearing to be uncertain, all I can hope for is the small victories: Patrick Brown, amusing colleague that he was, remaining out of parliament for at least another 6 months. Please read that last sentence as a prediction. Whoever wins on Monday, Liberal, Conservative, a bunch of pot smoking yogic flyers from BC, it is my prediction that it will be a small minority and we'll be back at the polls in January of 2005. It would be interesting to see one of my colleagues become and MP, but I can only hope that Pat Brown isn't the first.

      It appears our brief hunt for an apartment in London has been a success! We've found a huge (almost 1200 sq ft) apartment close to the downtown core. It's on the 11th floor, with a view of the river. It has all hardwood floors, except the kitchen and bathroom which are ceramic tile. It has a great swimming pool and zen garden in the back yard, along with a playground with swings and a slide! It's close to work, has parking and comes with a storage locker should we need one. Best of all it has a GIANT balcony that we can put a barbecue on. We're still working out the lease and the final details, but we might even be able to get it for the middle of August, which would give us some time to move in! It would also mean we'd be moving around the same time as Andrew, who will be moving to his new place in Ottawa right around then!  It will be sad to leave this place, but it'll be exciting to start up on a new chapter of life with new jobs, new city, new apartment, new furniture and maybe even a new kitten!   Oh, and since I haven't posted much in a dogs age... Scott and I had a GREAT time at Henley and Chuck's wedding on Singer Island. It was great to see everyone, and there is nothing better than it being hot enough out to go swimming at 9 in the morning, every morning. It has prompted much discussion as to where a move after London might take us, and it's looking more and more like the British Virgin Islands might be a good candidate for a future relocation destination. Anhow, the wedding was beautiful, right beside the water and everything, and it was great to be able to wear a little sundress and a flower in my hair and not be underdressed. In all it was a great trip; we did some snorkelling, body boarding, lots of swimming and sunbathing, boating, tubing and ate more seafood than you can shake a stick at. One of the highlights was the seafood feast on our last day there, where Kris grilled up pretty much every type of creature you can take out of the sea. We also managed to find our way to a biker bar, and one of our crew managed to score a biker babe! Luckily all the bikers turned out to be employed as law enforcement officers of one variety or another, so no rowdiness ensued. In all it was a great vacation, despite the fact that it was only 5 days long.

      It's the end of an era. The flaming look that has graced this page since its conception has died. Adieu. I've gone with something a little more earthy, more mellow. I just felt that today was the day that things had to change. This may mean I post more often, who knows, maybe the change of scenery will do me good... not to be too trite but I guess only time will tell.  As for what I've been up to lately, mostly the same old same old. Graduation has passed, and the family (Mom, Dad, Joe, Dianne, Jacob and Noah) came and visited and watched the epic moment that was the end of my scholastic career. (I think 7 years counts as an epic!). The alphabet conspired against me and I ended up seated next to a certain gentleman who I once dated, which was actually one of the highlights of the day. He was civil, almost pleasant albeit awkward, and I almost regret the thoughtless comment that came out of my mouth at the end of the ceremony... little Noah had a dozen roses for me and was standing at the end of my seating aisle, at which point I quip "Oh look, my new boyfriend got me flowers".   The Bar Admission course is about halfway over, which is half good and half bad (Good that half is over, bad that there is still half more to come). Whoever invented this hellish version of summer school for new lawyers should hook up with Donald Rumsfeld, they could share ideas.  The summer in Windsor is plugging along as per usual. I'm very sad that this will be my last summer here. Although I will enjoy breathing air that isn't in semi-solid form, I'll miss the city lovingly referred to as "Bizarro World".  Yet another Windsor story for you non Windsorites... the annual "fair" here is known as the Freedom Festival... or at least it was. They managed to go bankrupt last year and stiff the Guess Who for the unpaid bill for the concert last summer. So, the festival is now known as the "Windsor SummerFest" and appears to be a quickly organized Freedom Festival by a new name. This summer the "headlining act" was lined up to be none other than big haired 80's legend TIFFANY! Believe it or not (Yes, I know you all believe it), I was pretty pumped. After seeing Firehouse and the Killer Dwarves last summer I figured this would be a great last sampling of the Windsor concert scene. I was spreading the news of the 80's comeback concert of the century this evening, when a fellow student burst my bubble. It seems that what was once touted as the 80's pop icon actually may be some 19 year old unknown kid from Chatham. Seems the person who booked the concert, in his or her zealousness, didn't ascertain that the Tiffany booked was in fact THE Tiffany. I haven't confirmed this, but it fits with the bizarro world in which I have lived for the past 3 years. If it turns out not to be THE Tiffany I've decided I'm going anyway, and I'm going to scream "HEY TIFFANY!!! SING I THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW!" as loud as my lungs can manage.

      Why does my cat drink out of the bathtub faucet instead of his water bowl? Why do I have to write an exam about Business Law if I'm never going to use it? Why do some people never finish what they started? Why do people expect that everything should just be given to them, for free? Why does Henley's lawyer suck so much? Why don't people answer their emails? Why does it have to rain today? Why do my writing skills vanish from time to time? Why does anyone enjoy watching baseball? Why doesn't North America like football (soccer) more? Why do people settle for a relationship that isn't everything that they want/need? Why do people want to&nbsp;leave relationships when the person they're with treats them like gold? Why can't I get free gas for my car? Why are people so frightened of Pitbulls? Why does Andrew's friend Mike not realise he looks like Jason Mewes? Why do people look down on the homeless and the less fortunate?  Why don't I feel like getting out of my pyjamas today? Why do I always get given a knife and fork at Asian restaurants when there are clearly chopsticks on the table?  &nbsp; Just feeling pensive...

      Yesterday Scott and I, along with our friend Bernie, took the trip to South Bend Indiana's East Race Kayaking Course. It's the course that's used for the US Olympic&nbsp;Kayaking Team&nbsp;trials, and is basically an old&nbsp;canal&nbsp;that was made to divert logs around a giant waterfall. It looks very much&nbsp;like a sewer, complete with concrete and smelly water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most&nbsp;of the rapids are made of man made concrete rocks and old railway ties etc, but it's a fun ride.  Here are some pictures we took on the trip

      So here's the dilemna.  In about a month and a half I move.  The question has arisen, and Scott and I are currently considering the all important question: Do we want cable?  The past year and a half&nbsp;Scott and I&nbsp;haven't had cable.&nbsp; I had considered ditching the cable before that, back when I was living with Allison, but it was one of those luxuries that she really appreciated and one that I was pretty accustomed to anyhow, so we decided to stick with it. The lucky thing about Windsor is that in a residence without cable you get about 10 channels. CBS, NBC, ABC, UPN, the WB, FOX, the new WI, a bunch of weird bible stations, sometimes Ohio stations,&nbsp;and occasionally a blurry version of CBC.  When we move to London I believe things will be quite different. I'm expecting the antenna just won't pick up the American stations from that type of distance... so bottom line is: In London, no cable may just equal no TV.   So that's where the question comes in. I've found that life is pretty darn happy without TV. I used to find myself sucked into the infernal channel surfing, watching hours of the darn thing every day, watching things that didn't interest me because "there was nothing better on", and spending evenings glued to the boob tube.&nbsp; However, I do enjoy being able to watch my Tuesday night Amazing Race and the occasional dose of the Simpsons.... which I suspect I won't be able to do without cable in London.  Up until this point, cable has been a luxury that I've been glad I haven't been spending money on. An extra 40-50$ a month goes a long way towards groceries, rent, and the occasional sushi dinner out. Once I get to London though, money won't be so tight... so Cable (and the insane cost they charge you to INSTALL cable... yowsers!) will be a fiscal reality for sure. The free time has been nice, spent on evening walks by the river, cooking nice meals,&nbsp;conversations, studying, kayaking, or going out&nbsp;with friends... likely much more healthy for us too.&nbsp;   My big problem: I'm afraid I'll be sucked back in... If it's there, I know I won't be able to resist its luring electronic hummmm. I'm afraid that I'll again watch 2 or 3 hours or MORE of the damn stuff in a night.&nbsp; So there's my connundrum. I dont' know if I can live without SOME TV, but my willpower is so weak that I'm afraid I'll revert into a TV Junkie state...   If there's a compromise I'm not sure I can find it!

      Here are some pictures from this past weekend... Saturday: Spent a good chunk of the day at hoping lavishing attention on the new foster kitty. He seems to be getting over his cold and is in good spirits. He and Shamus hit it off better than Scott or I could have predicted, and he's eating like a horse. All good things. &nbsp; Sunday: Our Dragon Boat Team did VERY well, despite being robbed in our first race (losing to the OPP women!) &nbsp;and a heartbreaking defeat in the finals, coming second by a fraction of a second.&nbsp;We ended up coming&nbsp;5th out of 25&nbsp;teams, which was a respectable finish. &nbsp;In all, a great time was had by all and a good chunk of money was raised for breast cancer research. Check out our swanky shirts, which came out better than we could have hoped. Hopefully the race will become an annual event for the faculty of law. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      It looks like we might be getting a new kitten. I found this one at the humane society... he's been there for a long time and is really underweight and sickly. He seems to really need a home, so on Saturday he might get one. Still picking out names, but he's a boy and we're thinking Quinn (it means strong, fiery one). Scott likes Gizmo, cause of the gi-normous ears. Open to suggestions though, if anyone has any good ones!

      Yesterday was the fourth of July, which usually is a non-event in my life since I'm not American. In fact, I even lived in the US for one glorious fourth, and I'll tell you it really wasn't anything to write home about. So last night when at about 10pm I heard what sounded like thunder or gunfire, my mind raced briefly to "The US is under attack!"  rather than "Oh, fireworks". But, quickly it dawned on me that it wasn't thunder, nor was it an international incident... my neighbours to the north (Yes, Detroit is NORTH of Windsor, ain't that bizarro?) were celebrating freedom by blowing shit up. So, like the fireworks fiend that I am I rushed down the to river to watch the many many many fireworks shows that went on for a good two hours. Although you would think that with the amount of fireworks going off the show would be impressive, it was by all accounts in fact eerie. Because there were several shows and several individuals setting off their own bottle rockets and burning schoolhouses, it was very disjointed, with the entire length of the river having noise and light flashes going on somewhere. Most of the fireworks were far enough away that they didn't come into view, but their glow reflected off the low lying clouds, making for a look more like a missile strike than a fireworks show. If it wasn't for the occasional red, white and blue sparkle emerging from above the horizon, it would have been much creepier. It did lead me to wonder though, why fireworks aren't more strictly regulated. I mean, they have homeland security keeping breast milk off airplanes (If you haven't seen Farenheit 9/11, you'll understand when you do), and I'm sure we've all seen the warning on fireworks where little Johnny doesn't let go in time and has his hand blown off, proving the potential dangerous nature of fireworks, yet you can go by loads of explosives at the corner store? I guess it's a good thing that it hasn't come to that yet, cause quite frankly fireworks kick ass. Anyway, watching the fireworks show was definitely better than watching the end of Independence Day, despite the creepy factor.

      Since the movie independence Day came out, way back in the days of my youth, it has bothered me. In fact, almost to the point of rage. I would have probably forgotten it, in time, but the fire has been stoked. Of course they would play the movie today, and of course Scott would watch it. My issue: How does the dorky guy upload a computer virus to some alien computer with his Apple laptop? It isn't even an IMac.  Seriously, I know we're talking about an alien movie, but a little credibility please. The worst part is he does it through his dial up internet connection... What the hell. If the aliens ever do come maybe I should make sure I have a Palm Pilot so I can beam them a copy of Dope Wars to entertain them and possibly convince them to spare our puny little asses. Yeah, that'll work great. Anyhow, it makes me feel good to finally publicly express that issue which has bothered me for the past 10 years. Maybe now I can sleep a little easier.

      Happy Birthday Canada!!! My title is a saying off an old shirt my dad had that he used to wear on Canada Day. I don't think he has it anymore. It has probably been turned to rags by now, since that was probably 20 years ago. Anyhow, I hope you all had a great Canada Day and here's to many more! And now, a little more updated Canada Day T-shirt Slogan... CANADA KICKS ASS!

      Stole this from the CBC today:   The cat came back  18 years laterLast Updated Tue, 10 Aug 2004 10:09:16 EDT WINNIPEG - A Manitoba woman is celebrating the return of her lost cat 18 years after the pet first disappeared. "It's a miracle. There's no words to describe it," said Leslie Dumas, who had last seen her pet kitty Seagull in 1986. "It's just...I needed him and he needed me."  Seagull had gone missing following a house fire in Selkirk, located about 34 kilometres north of Winnipeg, when the cat was one year old. "We had a house fire, and we had moved, and somebody let the cats out and both cats went missing," Dumas recalled. Recently, a dehydrated and malnourished black cat was found wandering around the East Kildonan area of Winnipeg. A stranger brought him to the Winnipeg Humane Society. The identification tattoo in the cat's ear was still legible enough for the society to find the Dumas family. Dumas said she was puzzled when her father told her the Winnipeg Humane Society had called, asking her to get in touch with them. "I phoned them, and they said, 'We have your cat,'" said Dumas, who still lives in Selkirk. "I said, 'What cat?'" Dumas said she had to think back almost 20 years to 1986, when she was 22 years old. "I said to the vet, 'This can't be. He looks like Seagull, but how can this be?' He just said it has to be, because of the tags." Seagull, who is going on 20, has cataracts and poor vision. Seagull will be the guest of honour at a benefit for the Winnipeg Humane Society on Friday. Written by CBC News Online  urlLink staff

      Recently I've been noticing alot about "couples." I'm not exactly sure what brought all this revelating on, my guess is endless classes on divorce and spousal/child support, but with a divorce rate of more than 50%, coupled with the fact that children of divorce are more than 3 times more likely to get divorced themselves (meaning the problem likely isn't getting any better soon), it merits at least some thought.  I think I'm at the age where people are getting itchy trigger fingers. When you're younger, say from 18-23, things seem pretty relaxed. (Now let me just qualify that age group a little by saying that I'm from a social group where the age of "adulthood" seems to be later in life. Heck, I have freinds who are 25 or older that haven't lived outside of their parents house yet, and myself I'm 25 and still in school. I would guess that this age would be significantly lower for the graduate high school, enter into a career type social group.) Anyhow, at 18-23 nobody seems too worried they'll "never find that special someone". You're young, your life is in flux, gravity hasn't negatively impacted your looks... life is pretty darn good.  The problem is that from what I can tell, 99.9% of the time, the person that you chose at a younger age has very little relevance when you're 25. It seems to me that between those ages a caterpillar/butterfly thing happens and a new person emerges from the coccoon. It seems that peoples lives change so drastically during those "formative years". It just sort of makes sense that the person you would choose to date at 21 isn't the same person you'd choose to date at 28. This likely doesn't hold true after you get through the formative What's more frightening, however, is something I've noticed which for lack of better term I'll call the "Oh my God, I'm so afraid of being alone let me grasp on to this guy/girl even though he/she a) is not my type b) treats me like crap c) has physical feature X which I find appauling, d) insert other reason here". I guess the more concise term for this phenomenon would be "settling".  It's come to my attention that a huge majority of people settle. Maybe it's because of the age I'm at that alot of my friends have reached, as my friend Andrew eloquently called it, the "give up on your dreams" age. Maybe when you hit some magic age you freak out, and realise that if you don't become more realistic in what you expect in a life partner, you'll be alone forever. (Kind of like that "Lowered Expectations skit from Mad TV) In other cases it's clearly a convenience issue, where the person you're with or start dating is just a convienient person to have such a relationship with. Is this an example of being with someone so long, that your lives are easier with one another despite not having something more? Or, for example, people who have known each other for years before they start dating and then realise they're madly in love raise the question of whether there really can be a spark or if there's "No one better to date right now."  I guess that theory could be summed at as laziness, that the time and effort spent seeking Mr. or Ms. Right is not worth it, seeing as how they might not really exist, but I'm not sure I buy that completely. In my opinion, settling is more brought on by the fear of being alone forever; but whatever the reason I'm seeing it more and more as years go on.  I realise that no two people are ever going to be perfectly compatible. No one wants to be dating a clone of themselves (well, no one sane anyway). A significant other is only one piece of your life, and no one person should be your "entire world"... what a precarious position to be in really... A healthy relationship recognizes that no one person can give you everything you need in your life, and some of those things have to come from other places in your life, be it work, friends, hobbies, whatever. Some of what I'm seeing and calling "settling" is based on the trivial type of gripes with a partner (for example, dislike of his hairy back, dislike of one anothers hobbies, hating the way he leaves the toilet seat up etc), but others are even more serious examples of incompatibility. For example, couples with completely conflicting religious views, couples who don't find each other attractive, couples who don't communicate well with one another, couples who want to live in completely different parts of the province/country/world than one another, couples who don't agree on the importance of the instute of marriage, couples who disagree on having children, couples who dislike each others profession, couples who have diametrically opposed world views... I could go on.  Settling is more than just having these issues in your relationship. Most people probably have one or more of these in their relationship. I'm sure we've all dated someone who wasn't what we wanted... heck I dated a neanderthal just because he asked. The problem arises not just in the dating, but when the dating goes a step further... be it marriage, joint property ownership, major moves, having children, and the pre-existing issues aren't addressed. Compromise is always a good thing in any relationship, but it really worries me when people change their entire life philosophies, goals, beliefs or requirements in a mate. Is this a change of heart, or is this sacrificing who you are for a girl/boy?  And what do you do if you think your friend is starting down that scary path? I'm sure Allison was ready to shake me when I mentioned moving to the land of ice and snow some day with neanderthal man, but when is the time to jump in and when is the time to butt out? Is it worth risking a friendship over something a friend will probably come to their senses about in time anyway? When a good friend of mine got up the courage to leave a relationship that he felt wasn't working for him I offered probably the only safe thing to offer: support. I guess whipping a friend into seeing what you might think is plain as day is dangerously impossible when that friend is happy, even if it's naive happiness in your opinion. I know alot of people who are reading this that know me might be worried that "Hey!  She's talking about me!" Let me assure you, I'm not.  But... on the other hand... if that thought popped into your head...

      Just got back a few days ago from a nice 5 day trip to the lake. The weather was alright, and Scott and I had lots of time to practice some kayaking moves on flatwater. The next trip won't happen until late August. It's sad for both of us to only get two trips up there in the summer, but being 8-9 hours away is tough. On the bright side, London is 2 hours closer. Here are a few pictures taken this trip up, but the camera rarely got out of its case due to the crazy children running around. I promise a better photographic effort next trip for those of you who keep wanting to see the place.
