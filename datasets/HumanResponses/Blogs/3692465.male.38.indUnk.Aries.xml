      Last night, due to the generosity of Michael Buckingham, a gentleman that I met through on-line searching for Gmail invites,   I NOW HAVE A Gmail ACCOUNT!    Mr. Buckingham's generosity is truely an example of what is good with people! While others are making huge sums of many selling a free service, he unselfishly donated my account to me and I can't thank him enough! I can, however encourage anyone who wants to read a great blog and learn a little something about how to create a good one to visit his at  urlLink RAIN CITY STORY !  Gmail, despite the reputation among privacy advocates is AWESOME! The much disdained advertising is FAR less intrusive than that which Yahoo! Mail is tacking on to my sight! As a Bush/Cheney 2004 volunteer, I am particularly offended by their targeting me with John Kerry campaign ads whenever I log on to my e-mail account at work!  If I have the chance, I will offer some of you an invite to try Gmail! It has more than the cool kids' table appeal, it's a GREAT service!

      Google's new e-mail service "G-Mail" is all the rage and I have seen several hundred people selling invites to this FREE mail service online! I would like to begin a more appropriate and fair service! I propose a fair exchange of invites to G-Mail that can allow the "haves" to donate their unused invites to the "have nots"!  Unfortunately, I'm a "have not" and I need an invite to get the service started! If you have an invite that you would be willing to donate to me to this exchange off the ground, I have a few offers for you:  1. I will post a link to your website or blog permanently on this forum  2. I will write a post on the topic of your chosing with the ideals you'd like to express.  3. I will give you credit to each new recipient of an invitation and any message that you'd like to convey to help build or expand your blog and it's message!  I'd like this to become a generous meeting of those who have with those would like to have and make it a service of magnanimous generosity!  If you have an invite to give me to start the effort, please contact me at:  jgarlickmail@yahoo.com  I will entertain other ways to repay your generosity, so long as they are moral, legal, non-monetary and have the spirit of altuism at heart  Thanks, Jeff

      Hello & Welcome!  This is my first personal blog so please be kind and bear with me! I intend this to become a forum for discussion on topics that interest me or that I have a comment on! I don't know yet what the evolution of this blog will mold it into but then again, it's the journey in life that makes it interesting not the destination!  All posts are welcome however flames will be quickly extinguished! If you can't say something nice, don't waste my time or my readers time! There will be zero tollerance for mean spiritedness and abuse in my world! If you want to be a jackass, please feel free ON YOUR OWN BLOG!  Once Again, WELCOME  Jeff
