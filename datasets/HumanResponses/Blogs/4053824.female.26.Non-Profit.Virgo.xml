      Yesterday my Portland area Campus Crusade Director called to discuss my continuing at the  urlLink University of Portland  and also the possibility of going to  urlLink Pacific University  in Forest Grove, OR. He gave specific information about what the ministry would look like, and it seems to really fit my personality. It would involve spending a few weeks building relationships with a group of women in order to build a discipleship group of 7-10. My goal would be to take the women from participating to leading the small group by the end of the year. The philosophy of Campus Crusade has always been to  Win  - people to Christ,  Build - them up in their faith, and  Send  - them out into the world to cultivate new disciples. I am excited about the opportunities that I will have at both  urlLink Pacific University  as well as at  urlLink University of Portland  to live this philosophy out. Would you join me in praying that the Lord would give us wisdom in deciding which campus would be the best? Please pray also that the Lord would move in the hearts of people to become both prayer and financial ministry partners. I will not be able to start at  urlLink Pacific University  without more prayer and financial support.   Once again, if you have any questions or would like more information, I would love to hear from you! Email me    urlLink   here     , and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

       It's hard to believe that students at the  urlLink University of Portland  will soon be returning to their dorms, getting ready for classes to begin. All of this leads to a very busy next few months. In a few weeks, we will meet with a team of 6 students to pray over and plan the ministry on campus this next semester. Then in September we have a Leadership Retreat with anywhere from 25-30 students in attendance. This is such an exciting time, as we train the students in everything from "how to have an effective quiet time", to "how to disciple another student". We will spend time worshipping, praying and getting to know one another better.  Please pray that the team of students that have been chosen to lead Bible studies in their dorms would be unified with one vision and purpose. Just a reminder that if you would like more information about  urlLink Campus Crusade for Christ  or more specifically the ministry here in Portland please  urlLink email me  and I would love to talk with you!
