						   (An excerpt from Kelley's journal dated April, 1997. On temporary assignment to the U.S. Consulate in Munich, Germany, Kelley had just caught "The Tonight Show Starring Jay Leno" on MSNBC for the first time)  I don’t think I had ever seen “The Tonight Show” with Jay Leno before.  My days of staying up until midnight or later watching television are far behind me now, and in fact between my college days in the '70s and his retirement from "Tonight" in 1992, I seldom watched Johnny Carson.  Even when I was a reporter on radio station KUIC in California in the mid-'80s, and was coming in from work quite late many nights, I was more likely to tune in the old reruns on Sacramento's Channel 31 than  “Tonight.”  	 Under Leno, the show has been completely revamped: it resembles the David Letterman show now more than it does the old “Tonight” show.  Gone are the blue curtain and the spotlight, as well as the NBC Orchestra and the old “DA-da-da-da, da” theme music.  The whole thing is very '90s, with angular shots, the audience right up front, and new, minority faces in the band which have replaced those of Doc Severinsen and Ed Shaughnessy.     Leno has preserved the show’s best tradition, the opening monologue, and his writers are as good as Carson’s were, although the humor, like the rest of the show, has become appropriately ‘90s: Carson might have mentioned the “Heaven’s Gate” cult, but he would have had the good taste not to wring it for black humor as relentlessly as Leno is doing. Well, that’s the ‘90s for you—America has become a nation of namby-pambies, busybodies and crybabies who recoil with righteous horror at tobacco, alcohol, fatty foods, vivisection, fur-wearing and political incorrectness, and who run crying to Mr. Lawyer when their iddle-widdle feelings are hurt, but who nevertheless laugh, snicker and guffaw at mass suicide.     I didn’t stay with the show past the opening monologue; even in the old days I would usually turn the set off and go to bed after the monologue unless there were a guest on the show I particularly wanted to see.  In any case I’d seen enough.  The “Tonight Show” is still basically what it’s always been, but revamped of course for contemporary manners and mores.     For me, though, it served as just one more reminder of how this foreign service life, which I’ve now been living for more than a decade, has cut me off from the American “mainstream.”    I haven’t watched American television with any regularity since the early 1980s, and in fact my habit for the past few years of confining myself in the evenings to videotapes of "Nick at Nite" and my “generic” tapes of favorite reruns has really placed me behind the times.  "Seinfeld” is the current measure of what’s funny, but I’m still watching “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and “Green Acres,” the shows I watched as a kid.   I did watch “Seinfeld” once, and found it about as funny as a root canal, this program of which Jay McInerny wrote not long ago in TV Guide that it may be the funniest show of all time (funnier than “I Love Lucy?”—I don’t know.)  But that’s the way things are drifting, and they have left me behind: I’m an old fuddy-duddy at 41.  Last year Hal Hinson, writing in the Washington Post, gave the Steve Martin movie “Sgt. Bilko” a middling review, in the course of which he slammed the old Phil Silvers TV show with a sidealong cheap shot.  Imagine: the classic “Sgt. Bilko,” one of the funniest programs ever aired on CBS, which had Neil Simon among its writers and featured the flawless comedy acting of Silvers, Paul Ford and Joe E. Ross, getting a condescending sneer from some Perrier-sipping, overpaid Beltway ignoramus who’s trying to appear cutting-edge hip. I wrote the paper a letter in which I called Hinson a "moron," and then, this being the 1990s, in which even hard-boiled critics are entitled to get their widdle feelings hurt and run crying to Mommy, I got a letter in reply from some gerbil of a sub-editor, tut-tutting at me for calling poor little Hal Hinson mean names. Screw Hinson and his nitwit editor both.     Not that my tastes are entirely mired in the '50’s and '60’s: during my recent two-year sojourn in Washington I discovered--and loved--a couple of more recent sitcoms, “The Golden Girls” and “Mr. Belvedere.”  But again, both of these programs were in production roughly between 1985 and 1992, and they have left the air now.  They may be more recent than “The Beverly Hillbillies,” but they are not "contemporary" in the sense of still being in production.    Of course television is only part of it.  Whenever I leave the United States for any extended period of time, when I return I find that something has changed in American popular culture while I was gone, and I get a little culture shock.    The first one that comes to mind is my discovery of the “infomercial.”    When I returned to America in 1988 after my first two years here in Germany, I had never seen an infomercial, didn’t know what one was.  These 30-minute commercials disguised as interview programs had been invented while I was over here.  So, when I found myself in a motel room in Warrenton, Virginia watching what seemed to be a straightforward interview with two guys who had successfully used some hair-restoring product, I ordered a bottle of it by phone.  It smelled nice, as I recall, but I remained bald.    A few years later I was home for Christmas and discovered that big grocery store chains like Von’s and Safeway had begun staying open 24 hours a day.  That was a big surprise.     During last year’s presidential election campaign, I kept seeing the term “Soccer Mom” in the news, but I had no idea what it meant, and I’ve never actually seen anybody dance the Macareña.      Armed Forces Network was never a panacaea for this, and even now that we have the Internet, which we didn’t have ten years ago, I don’t think it’s going to keep me “in touch” either, because the fees we get charged outside the U.S., both for on-line service and just for using the local telephone line, are prohibitive. It costs so much to log on here that I, for one, don’t use America Online for anything except retrieving e-mail, a quick look at the news headlines, or a very quick trip to the Tower Records website to order a compact disc or two.	   No, it would seem that a foreign service employee is condemned to be, for the tenure of his employment with the government anyway, something of an exile.  I don’t necessarily have a problem with this.  I’m not all that crazy about stateside life to begin with (I suspect that my Russian-born friend Lena Watt, born and bred in Novosibirsk and currently living in Moscow with her American husband and daughter, probably misses the United States more than I do) and anyhow, the role of “exile” appeals somehow to the “boring romantic” in me, to quote a 1985 song by John Cougar Mellenkamp.  Surely “outsider” is a role I have never eschewed, and I don’t think missing out on the latest generation of trashy television shows and garbagey popular music necessarily makes one culturally deprived.  (I take some pride these days in the fact that when the Grammy awards are passed out, I seldom recognize any of the winners, and as often as not that turns out to be the case with the Oscars as well.)     Perhaps it’s not just being out-of-touch with contemporary pop culture that bothers me so much as the fact that having fallen behind the times, regarding television anyway, (I’m not going to worry about music—I defected to the timeless Mozart and Stravinsky when I was 16) signifies that I have fallen victim to the old-fogeyism for which our parents’ generation was constantly getting panned when I was young.      During the Vietnam era it was especially bad.   The media created the famous “Generation Gap” of the 1960s in response to tensions between younger people who opposed the Vietnam war, (because they were being drafted to go fight it), and older people who were unable to see that this wasn't the same kind of war that World War II was, tended to support Vietnam as a similarly righteous crusade, and consequently to regard the twentysomethings who opposed the war as both unpatriotic and ungrateful.  Then, having created the “Generation Gap,” the media proceeded to give it so much attention that everyone began to take it for granted.  If you were 25 or under you were the object of media adulation and assumed to be the quintessence of hip: up on the latest styles, the latest music, the latest slang. If you were over 30, on the other hand, you were caricatured as hopelessly out of touch, sitting in your rocking chair thinking that Tommy Dorsey and “Your Hit Parade” were still the cutting edge. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe TIME magazine's "Man of the Year" for 1966 was "Anyone Under 25.") And what the news media wrought, Madison Avenue was not slow to pick up: youth was used to hawk everything from coffee to toothpaste in the 1960s. I do in fact recall a TV commercial in which a "sensible" daughter steers her youth-struck mother from a supposedly-frivolous brand of toothpaste back to the sponsor's more feet-on-the-ground product.       These stereotypes got a lot of attention of course, not-so-subliminally drilling home the message that it was good to be young and hip and bad to be old and behind the times.  Eventually, as such things do, this us-versus-them mentality filtered all the way down into the elementary schools: amongst my friends there were words you were supposed to use, clothes you were supposed to wear and radio stations you were supposed to listen to. In San Diego, circa 1967, if you deviated from top-40 KCBQ and KGB radio, you were in for it. Once, when a school acquaintance found out that I’d been listening to KOGO, the NBC radio affiliate in San Diego which played Nancy Wilson and Frank Sinatra rather than Strawberry Alarm Clock and Small Faces, he began asking me derisively where my electric car was--electric cars were something only senior citizens used in those days.    So maybe that’s what’s really bothering me when I find myself not laughing at the “new” Tonight Show, finding Jerry Seinfeld's wildly-popular program about as funny as dental surgery and having to admit that I would rather watch “The Andy Griffith Show” than “Roseanne.”     Sure, I'm not alone in  these preferences. Nick At Nite owes its very existence to Baby-Boomer nostalgia for the shows that those of us born during the Eisenhower years grew up with.  But my fellow Boomers back in the States can have both sides of it—-they can switch over to Nick at Nite to watch “I Love Lucy” after “Seinfeld” is over.  I’m 5,000 miles from all that, and haven’t even bothered getting cable TV here in Germany—I didn’t want to pay AEA for it, so I decided to do without it.  And so I’m watching videotapes that I’ve had for six, seven, eight years and more, tapes of shows that were old when I made them: “The Addams Family,”  “Make Room for Daddy,” “Car 54.”  I’ve seen them 10,000 times each.   That’s called being in a rut, and when I was 12 it was what we expected of people in their 40s. But then, being in our own 40s was something we never imagined.

						    Verrezano Narrows        (for Charles Berigan)  Borough-wide tonight,  you can smell the preparations-- around corners, in cul-de-sacs,  It's everywhere: cooking. Over in Manhattan,	 everything's "good to go," R.H. Macy's cocked and ready for the big moment; campers on the sidewalk, cops cruising, yawning,  anticipating midnight, Rockefeller Center  emblazoned with bells. Gunning the engine after one more annoying toll: almost there now, just this last monstrosity to climb, spidery night-cathedral, and the long drive's over.  I'm not usually afraid of bridges-- There was that one, crossing the Strait of Carquinez, train trestle alongside, and as I put my head out, sampling the summer wind, I suddenly noticed we were  hundreds of feet in the air, and a little too close to the edge.   The toll booth was a lighthouse-- Here again, that giddiness: this isn't 14th Street in Washington, D.C. where your biggest worry is low-flying planes, this is a bridge, climbing   to where you understand  why everybody's speeding,  and catch yourself wondering, "What year was this thing built?" A queasy space beneath  my nervously-rushing two-door, The Narrows are a perfect reflection of starless night, black--could be a mile deep.  63rd Street's a brownstone corridor, cold wind scraping leaves along the lined-up  trash cans in the November night, Brooklyn cops shaking down suspects against a  grocery store, beneath the glare and the graffiti, then the climb up the stairs, the dog's insistent barking, The sudden caress of warmth and the light from the dusty lamp between the two pianos. Stacked up on the bench of one, American Record Guides collect dust right along with newspapers, CDs,  an old sock the dog was chewing, Rachmaninoff's biography in a yellowed edition. At this piano I took  your picture one night, years back, across the river, playing muted Chopin so as not to disturb the neighbors.  My first time in the city: coming in from LaGuardia, the cabbie overheard us discussing Leonard Bernstein, and said "See you gentlemen at the Philharmonic," (though he never did). We got out in the west seventies, and moments later walked past the Dakota--you pointed out  the very spot where John Lennon bled to death. Moments when music defines memory stick up over that jagged, well-lit landscape, interior skyline, shifting,  fluid like burning night in the city always tossing in its celebrated wakefulness. Picking up the yellowed bio, turning a page, I frown: the curse of high-acid paper. It was either that night or the next, we hiked along Riverside Drive, (it was late) to take a look at the building Rachmaninoff owned, with Gershwin living in the penthouse for a while: Imagine: Rachmaninoff as Gershwin's landlord; that New York is gone for good.  Years had already blunted the edge of our respective capacities for joy, but looking up where you pointed, as the night wind off the Hudson blew scraps of newspaper around our feet, I could remember a time when it would have been a shrine. The irony always amused me: We met playing football in high-school p.e. class, you fourteen, looking twelve, skinny, pale, long-fingered kid in a white sweatshirt, the slightly-misspelled name of a dissident priest printed across your chest in  black laundry marker, squared off against me, slightly older and larger, truculently unathletic, arrogantly uninterested, determined at all costs  not to be the athlete my father dreamed of. Opposing linemen. Hike--the ball was snapped. I gave you a passing shove just for appearance's sake, then walked away, superiorly, whistling the first eight notes of Beethoven's "Eroica." You picked up the tune, finished the phrase and made a joke about "token resistance..." More than twenty years ago.  Tomorrow will find us Cruising the liquor store  browsing for some wine cheap enough not to strain  our wallets, but pricey enough not to embarrass us later when we hand them to our hostess. Push the books off the bench, and take a seat... To name is not necessarily to command; with ease, you could make sense of those hieroglyphics  like I never managed to, although for years my mother made pin money, playing her own gigs, "Music lady,"  first for the Methodists, and then later, twice a week, (Wednesday nights and Sundays) over at the Christian Scientists'. Some things just aren't in the genes. In high school, the choir director (surely you remember him: thin, bald, into Jesus; fed us religious repertoire he'd never get away with now, fired in disgrace  many years later for  something to do with one of his girl students)	 pointing out the parts: treble,  bass, semiquaver, leger line, F-A-C-E and  everygoodboydeservesfun... though I loved to listen, it was all lost on me: I had to carry my part by ear, following the lead of off-key Keith to my left, or like so many of the rest, remember how it sounded on the radio, only to get it wrong: "this arrangement's different." No such problems for  you: if anything it came too easily. (My sister, sometime alto, still laughs about the night, during the "Hallelujah Chorus," when you somehow forgot the rest of us were there: taking the bit, you ran off, oblivious to the director's desperate sotto voce: "CHARLIE!"--you proceeded with your solo as we watched the top of his head turn red, playing faster and faster until he didn't dare hold the pause before that final "Hallelujah!" more than one single beat-- you had us all rolling like the Wehrmacht into Poland; someone would have "broken." "Well," when it was over, he said, mopping his head as the veins went down, "That's the first time I've ever heard the 'Hallelujah Chorus' played as the 'Minute Waltz.')  Morning. You scratch your head as the dog fusses in circles to be taken outside. "We missed Macy's parade." "Big deal."  A stretch and yawn and then the two of you go off for fifteen minutes. With water on to boil, I look over the piles and piles of  compact discs-- by the time you walk back in, we have Kiri singing Kern. A few hours to kill. The things that I'll attempt to reconstruct the next bridge over, are still back there, the war that Hemingway deliberately left out of Big Two Hearted River, the watershed that led me up to your door last night; the long weekend alone would have been ill-advised; Dylan himself was surely on an even-enough keel when, declining an invitation one Thanksgiving, he stayed back in his room and wrote Just Like a Woman instead. It's a state much to be envied, and elusive at bad times. No, I think, regarding the orange peels on the paper atop the counter among the dust, it's best to be here.  The dog shoves her face deep into her food bowl as Kiri gives the bloodshot morning an unacknowledged caress.  Outside, it doesn't look much like rain or snow. And  there he is once again: the face on the piano bench: "A six-and-a-half foot scowl," Stravinsky called him once; "Magnificent Rachmaninoff" he was to Chaliapin, or so he says in the memoir I was reading that long night aboard the train from Moscow to St. Petersburg--that everything, it appears, is gone for good. Walking along beside the river, water too cold to contemplate chopped by the breeze we're bucking, the afternoon sunlight ineffectual like it almost always is this time of year,  we zip up our jackets. I rattle off a poem just completed last week, marking an anniversary: it gets a "hmm."  Yes, it's been that kind of year. Far off  up the water, the Statue of Liberty ignores us; did immigrants slouching toward Ellis Island  get the same impression? Here, on Brooklyn's most fashionable streets, you almost have to wonder. "Lotta mafia live here." "Nice houses--" that cartoon  I saw not long ago in The New Yorker: "First we take you out for ice cream, then  we throw you off The Verrazano-Narrows," yuk yuk yuk--tough town: Memories are equally vivid of the first stroll we took past Carnegie Hall, and down that Saturday-night street out of Martin Scorsese, Ominous dark cars lined up alongside the curb before that infamous restaurant, patrol cars oozing in  and out in slo-mo.  We drive to Coney Island, Under the El, re-tracing  the car chase scene in The French Connection, Vivaldi on the radio, the ocean brilliant, wind-whipped November boardwalk, talk thickening all around us from English to Russian as we hike into Brighton Beach, a quick step back eight time-zones to familiar sights: the sign facing the street, reading "PECTOPAH," the street vendors hawking books: the needlepoint of cyrillic print on wooden  tables. Then all the way back it's classic jazz: WNYC:  no limit to the music here. Thanksgiving dinner now: our well-meaning host plays one Tchaikovsky symphony after another, (that’s  for me--you told him I’d been in Moscow) but then I request a switch to Mozart; too many familiars come along with Peter Ilyich anymore, not the least of which the one in charge of early memory : I  was just 13, and every attempt of our teachers to get us to listen was as lost on me as on everyone else: music meant top 40; a field trip to the opera was an excuse to throw  paper planes from the mezzanine, music appreciation note-passing time-- (naps for the nascent "heads"--) but that morning was different. Mrs. Easton, lagging on her paperwork, no doubt, slapped Overture 1812 on the  phonograph, and told us all to shut up and keep quiet. Nobody did, of course, but the music drowned us out so she could concentrate. The note-passing must have by-passed me that day-- there was nothing left to do but listen.  So  I did. Then my sister had a birthday: among her presents, Serkin Plays Beethoven intrigued me by its cover. The next thing I knew, the "Pathetique" Sonata had me by the chin, that second-movement song the perfect accompaniment to the December snow outside the window as I stood, my back to the stove, pouring a cup of coffee, wondering if school would be closed. Christmas of '68---- space was big that year: first there was 2001  and then Apollo 8. I asked for the soundtrack, and the Tchaikovsky both; surprise--there they were in their places beneath  the tree. As that big blue earthrise flickered across 50 million TV screens, and the crew  of the Pueblo walked across the bridge back to freedom, Tchaikovsky, Strauss, Ligeti and Khatchaturian filled up the basement where my bedroom was, the ground-level windows packed solid white--it turned out to be a severe winter. And to this day, I hear Gayne’s Adagio  and I think "snow" seconds before I remember to think "space."  The last of dinner's been cleared away.  We audiophiles,  acceding to small slices of pie and tepid cups of afterthought coffee,  repair to compare, taking up positions in front of Hyperion's awe-inspiring $5,000 stereo, popping old recordings of Schumann and Mahler, accompaniment to his preparations for work, ("You gotta work Thanksgiving?" "I don't mind. I might make two hundred bucks tonight") strapping his cummerbund around his waist, straightening a bowtie sharp as St. Andrew's cross, ironing black pants. But the food and wine have done their work: Bruno Walter's phrasing in the fourth-movement chorus of  the Mahler Third Symphony, and then Leonard Bernstein's is just sweet sound; I nearly doze, then Hyperion suggests we head downtown with him. He works the Rainbow Room tinkling out tunes for the furry  and the bejeweled--"Great view from the 69th floor." Nothing else on our agenda; What the hell?  Let's go. Rockefeller Center emblazoned with bells: that New York  will never die.  Pressed into an elevator with better-dressed people, discussing other, unseen better-dressed people,  our stomachs briefly remind us of that big dinner as we're whisked Rapidly up to the softly- lit, carpet-deadened world of self- congratulation three or four hundred feet above the sidewalk, where the wind still blows, and 47th Street suffers the slow indignity of  creeping "mall-ization." The wind’s harder up here, colder, too: vertigo. The top of the Empire State, 16 blocks in front of our faces, is a womb compared to this: no glassed-in deck here, just the roof, the edge, the drop--facing that panorama, too much even for Whitman to take whole; my palms start sweating: the wind’s awaiting its chance to sweep us overboard, and 69 floors down. This is for the birds-- Let's get back to the hubbub.  A quick swing past the White Horse, where that earlier Dylan met his nemesis, and haunts the walls above the rocking din Still, then it's back out across the river, home to conjure one more time the spirit of "that which unifies:" The lights, the dust, cold beer, late night, past disasters, the present and what might lie beyond morning that lurks beneath the river, and then the sound, that benediction, Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto, the Vespers of 1909...         Kuznetski Most       (for Nadya)  Here’s an idea--the Titanic went down with the band still playing: just how ephemeral is sound?  Water’s just air, a likewise medium-- echoes like the moon, visible only because of that pale stolen fire The Man  talked about, echo--how long?--a question recently asked in music. Imagination on an errand: I dreamed once, below the equator, of an afternoon in California spring, a dream so real I swear I felt the coastal breeze on my face, saw the dial on the radio in the kitchen. Here again, the idea of the band playing on forever-- numbered snowflakes blowing up and down the street at dusk, around the corner the Bolshoi, lit and filling up for  a silent concert that may or may not ever end, voices crying “S nov’im godom!” over the heads of the everlasting booksellers like ghosts on the other side of a winter night. It’s still there, fading but there, retrievable in theory, no--in fact, as long as  blood proceeds in its humming orbit of the phenomenal. Somewhere along this street you’re standing underneath a column or a lamppost-- (what joy in discovering which), your face no less than music borne on the wind of this snow that freezes nothing  “real,” music vibrating in water, light from stars that may or may not be there anymore. Tolstoy crossed this bridge once; what chance of picking out the reverberations of one diminishing voice from all  the others?  They’re here, though, bet on it, and the bricks of Red Square just as much there as when we stood in line, Sunday morning at Lenin’s tomb, hustled, hushed through and emerged back into the sunlight to make the rounds of those recently-dishonored dead. This kind of excursion has one advantage over that: instantaneous movement.  Now we drive along the boulevard on a summer night, passing St. Basil’s (lit by the late sun), now I’m watching out the window, four stories up, the smoke from those eternal factories disgracing the sunset as I think the words, “Krim, Klin...” You gave them to me to memorize; we ran out of time, time that’s supposed to be illusion, but plays on the surface like a loud, intrusive voice, like pounding on the wall. Voices, music, chimerical light-- Proust had it right, but how elusive is that tea-soaked  eternity he stumbled across; a one-time shot from forever like the comet slamming  into Jupiter, or the first morning recognized as such. Who would have thought that summoning one snowflake would be the hardest thing of all? Your face? Forget it.  A photograph is tacked to the wall, defiant of seasons, and yet, I hear you’ve cut your hair, changed this and that...Footsteps clicking on cobblestones are scraped or caressed in turn by those afterthoughts of October, leaves that burn in the remembering, their whisper just another  source of  the language that pours unceasingly from above the frozen flames torn from your soul: the gleam in your eyes as they found me in the brightly-lit lobby of the conservatory swims through that water as well. Moscow!  There’s nothing like it.  In New York City, In West L.A., I’ve monitored rhythms peculiar to both, sniffed the ocean, tapped  into the bloodstream of never- sleeping night, sampled perhaps, in some small way, the inheritance, America of Whitman, of Kerouac, a birthright...but there is no cold shower like this: dusha’ means soul in Russian-- Spengler’s down and out-- do it: go in: dive deep. Rumors say there’s music down there anyway. I turn the corner, and under a lamppost, you’re standing in the snow. I’ve seen this before: yes, the stage-setting for Pique Dame, Act III, Scene II, around another corner. But this is no tragedy, you won’t be flinging yourself in a canal. The waters of this unhappy river have flowed on past Any Act III, any scene II, things bigger than us attending. Screams and bullhorns and flag- waving at the parliament, shouting and shooting, rhetoric in the rubble, some kind of  phoenix trying to get itself reborn against all odds-- we hurried back to the embassy that warm afternoon, the air suddenly stopped like the moment before the clouds tear open on the equator; the bullhorns had been replaced by sporadic gunfire; before it was over, the casualties outnumbered 1917, (there anyway) tanks rolled, bullets flew, the crowd watched from the bridge, eating ice cream.  The dust hadn’t settled from that when your eyes appeared in that crowded lobby in bright November, locked on me, drew me into your own “humming orbit  of the phenomenal;” that light, that moment:  a pebble in still water, concentric circles that have left the solar system,  spreading out beyond wavelength, into whatever is meant by “eternity.” What is?  To be outside of time must be a bore, or so I considered once, writing down notes to a shade who (I didn’t expect otherwise) never answered back. Then again, wasn’t it Faust whose undoing was a request For time to stay its hand? We stood under another streetlight, another night, a poet who had died for love Or politics, take your pick, watching over our heads, and I read to you out loud about a sleeping river. Where it’s forever 2:15 on a bright afternoon in May, a light breeze blowing from the ocean, the sun positioned just so, that’s where that moment resides--can it be had again for the asking?  As I walk along Pennsylvania Avenue on a Sunday morning, the traces of Saturday night lingering with the sleepers on the steam grates, and the papers crumpled, outdated on the sidewalk, reminders buzz around, gnats by the reflecting pool. Each one a quantum, each potentially broken open, might flower like some lotus sutra condemned to exist through memory, a terrible angel of its own. It drifts back to Zwemmer’s, the English-language bookstore where on a winter day I surfed the stacks, searching for that book you said you couldn’t live without--"Gero’i Nashevo V’remeni”--a master’s sleight-of-hand: time shuffled like a deck of cards in some god’s fingers, hiding-in-plain-sight magic, magic that you told me strummed somehow on your heart. I took it home, rode over those Caucasian landscapes  myself as February paled  its way on into March; spring thunderstorms were still only an implied threat.  In your eyes, memory stayed safe in the womb of that Russian night where you sprang out of the light, to take your place along those ever- lasting streets of fire, the streets where you drift, spirit-mist of remembrance over things everyday and “immortal:” your chimerical lover who haunted that garden under Tamara’s  window far to the south, whose imagined image you showed me (I was jealous, but then humbled to learn who he was--who among us would be crazy enough  to resent the intrusion of a visitor from  there?) and the spot on the street where, forevermore,  imaginations will pause the moment it takes to join Pierre beneath his cloak, contemplating the tick- tock of history under the aegis of  the big comet-- “Isti Mirant Stella”--a clock and a barometer of strife.  Nobody’s winter ends quite so abruptly: the arrival of spring here is a much- repeated story.  (If music can reverberate in a theoretical forever, how much more cogently can a clap of springtime thunder?) Thunder -- to Joyce it meant The Fall: for us, it didn’t need to be emblematical of anything; it simply was, no hundred- letter word required; thunder spoke, and the midnight dreams of long winter evenings shattered.  We stood to behold, in the rudest kind of light, the “ogre doing what  ogres can,” rats pacing before a window full of jewelry, our own little ship, more frail than the tsar’s hand-made one, in full retreat before a flotilla of invading icebergs in the blank blaze of afternoon. Now the bridge and the walk across it, and around the corner to the Bolshoi, where  the everlasting concert is still in progress,  are the province of the power that re-creates the candle- flame after it’s puffed out: the smoke that hangs forever on motionless dead air in unfocused space is its domain, heraldic such as all recaptured time  must be, and that goes for music as well: the Schubert symphony through which we sat, holding hands at the conservatory, the slow movement of  Beethoven’s Emperor, Ewig, summoning up the  morning its strains ran through my head as I watched the sun come up in California...who is to call these things any  less real than the table- top across which they and I exchanged mutual glares, or  the piece of paper I  had to sign, that sop to those who wanted the war to go on, because without it they  were utterly lost? This glade they can’t reach: the hiker who gets here is beyond their grasp, like Nietzsche scaling mountains to escape his dead father, like Beethoven the other side of every torment, laughing along with whatever god could hear, in the last movement of Op. 131. The crowd has passed the bridge now; across the river in Park Kultur’i the ferris wheel turns beyond time,  just another wheel within a wheel, the Chinese box  of perception that may or may not have a center at all; it doesn’t matter as long as I see your eyes on every street-corner stolen from the too-insistent sun.  Turn the corner again: Rachmaninoff, all six feet six of him, takes his place at the piano, unsmiling, but “magnificent.”  He plays, we listen, in the room, or just outside the window, where the breeze coming up from  the awakened river takes the sound down the street, across the fence, over the frozen flowerbed, around the corner, into eternity.  He plays on...      Coronado      (in memory of Michael C. Baker, 1953-1994)  A long time ago you needed the ferry to get over there, but that was before our “flowering,” when places like Mickey Finn’s and the island were local playgrounds for airline crews laid over in this dead Navy town.   later this useful eyesore went up--it looks lousy on postcards, unlike its over- photographed neighbor to the north.  Today, festooned with signs bearing a number you can call if you’re tempted to jump, it makes an undistinguished lazy-S across what was once a beautiful bay.   I think of you while driving underneath--it was right along here somewhere that you “ditched” me that night, because you wanted  to be alone with my sister. To think there was a time I would have tossed you off this bridge without a second thought: that unfortunate first meeting, about which we  always laughed later,  calling it ‘When Robin Hood met Little John.’  This span was going up at the same time we were, during that nasty polyester decade, which some wisecracking journalist named after a pronoun. Nixon.  Brezhnev.  Disco.   yuck.  The layered look. platform shoes found their architectural equivalent launched across the water in tacky splendor from  National City, and a more perfect starting-place I couldn’t  have picked myself.   the lights were nice at night, though, when the lights were all  you could see. We cruised beneath on my graduation night, a night going down the tubes completely, until you showed up at 10 p.m., after everyone else had gone to bed.  I was parked in front of the tube, feeling hugely sorry for myself, and then you came in from work, a ‘64 Taittinger in hand. As the champagne cooled in the freezer, we went out record-shopping.  It was still the age of LPs--David Bowie and Bette Midler were giant faces in the window at  the hot-dog stand of  Tower Records. Later, after the music,  the champagne, a pizza around the corner, we stumbled on home through the jasmine-scented, soft June night--”Coffee beans, cha-cha-cha!”---hard to believe one was ever young enough to get that high on two or three glasses of wine.  Some thought you a hooligan, but I knew that your swagger down the wild side was mostly make-believe: the telephone receiver in the Volkswagen was a stage-prop, the Luger had no firing-pin. One had to be undeceived in order to become your friend. I was, and I did. O those sweet cruising years, from then to the end we had them to live again and again, first not to value enough, to enjoy for a shorter time than it would later seem, and then to remember,  to replay and embellish as hair got thinner and waistlines thicker. Somehow, though, you stayed there, played out the tragedy of--who?  Literature and the movies have only a few prototypes: Peter Pan, maybe, or closer to our own time, John Milner, whom we actually discussed, seriously, while driving home from the movies after seeing “American Graffiti” for the  first time.  The cars always remained flashy for you, and the guns eventually became real, though you only popped them off up in the hills on Sundays. But that awful decade accomodated itself  to your dreams: after all those tie-dyed  years of  sit-ins and demonizing, now, suddenly, The Pigs became the new centurions--there were 200 cop shows on the tube, a new sympathy, and you found a whole new crop of heroes. (and either downtown at the movie houses, where the jujubes stuck to your shoes like shit, or at the drive-in, slouched down in your sleek ‘67 Mustang on  a dead Friday night, from  “Serpico” to “The Super Cops,”, we saw them, every cheesy one.) Michael, you wanted to be just like that, and maybe that’s why it didn’t happen: you did persuade the reserves to take you, and I’ll never forget your pride when you showed me that Colt, new, shiny, quiet, deadly, and O-so-shimmeringly male, and the rights and priveleges pertaining thereto you took so seriously as well. The fourth of July:  we were driving out to Coronado, bored out of our skulls, thinking we’d watch the bicentennial fireworks downtown and maybe split a six-pack. we took the long way around, by-passing the bridge.  Then the traffic slowed.  There had been an accident.  You felt in your wallet for that badge they had given you, then insisted on stopping to help lay out flares and wave traffic on by. I sat in the Dodge, annoyed, the radio for company, while I waited for you to help in the cleaning-up of a mess I couldn’t even see.   We made it to the beach, kicked back on the sand with some Schlitz .  (It was always your brand, after you saw Clint Eastwood pull one from the fridge in “Magnum Force.”) In the shadow of that hotel we remember from “Some Like It Hot,” while the black ocean talked its talk forever fifty feet in front of us, you replayed  the accident, dreaming of bigger future things: breathless code threes, drug busts; “Narcotics, Baker.” it didn’t happen.   You had to learn that the Colt was far from the whole story. the city justified the badge, and not the other way around. Not long after, I looked you up. I had to be told  where to find you.   The apartment, the bimbo, the un-cleaned litter box, the drugs...Yes, it was two steps back all right,  and when I left, in a hurry, mumbling excuses, you hardly  looked up from  the screen.  but that time you came back like a written-off cat, and got back to business. Glen Abbey always struck me as a ghoulish place for  weddings: a chapel in a cemetery; talk about tempting fate. (There’s a certain lexical justice, I think, in the rhyme of married and buried.) But the place was popular for that; probably still is. That year I drove up from the desert four times for weddings; two of them were there, and one of them was yours.  Memory may be tweaking the facts to jive with the heart, but I think I remember some mischievous look, some almost- eyeball-rolling shared between us two former outlaws, as you slumped out of the  chapel, your bride on your arm. Then life continued its accustomed business,  levelling-off, wearing-down and thinning out. Men now, we watched our days meld one into the next, trying not to notice how they were steadily picking up speed.   We saw each other now only when I was passing through. life had taken me elsewhere, you stayed close to home. But always we’d make a point of an evening, now among broken toys, potty seats that had to be drunkenly removed, carpets scattered with picture books, and walls hung with reminders of the distance into which youth was fading, to tell the old jokes again, replay the heartbreaks, (my sister was yours) and then, with embarrassed side-glances, awash in a mnemonic pool of Schlitz and Cutty Sark,  pop “Thunderball”  into the VCR and fall asleep on the couch.  Some say there are no such things as accidents. A large-busted, brainless girl I once dated would have said that there was a reason I was in town that spring, just happened to be taking a little R&R, and thought I'd check in. I had in mind nothing more or less than the usual obligatory evening of getting mawkish over beer and darts in the garage.   Your wife answered the phone. "Are you sitting down?" she asked me.  No Schlitz and Sean Connery this time-- I drove out to say goodbye. I tried to keep things light, popping wheelies in  your wheelchair as you sat propped up in bed. Morphine blurred the edges of the old jokes, but we told them anyway, and even, incredibly enough, talked about my sister one more time--I didn't Have the lack-of-heart to tell you that she'd gained 100 pounds, not that it would have  mattered much by then. I was back in Moscow, tking deep breaths and smelling shit, when she called from  eleven time-zones away to give me the news. Punching the CD player almost at random that night over a Scotch, what do you suppose I got?  Vespers--his version. I gave it a run-through--not a deliberate memorial; music was never anything to you eExcept window-dressing,  accompaniment for the race downtown, or some moment to be embroidered later, like the night you danced in the parking lot with Sue, throwing open the doors of the Dodge so the car-stereo could bounce Lalo Schifrin off the walls.  I didn't see that, but I heard about it later. no, it was an accident (or maybe not) that once again, one more time, Rachmaninoff came drifting by like the H E L Y S guys in "Ulysses," only there if you happened to be paying attention at the time.  Do I believe in angels? Well, maybe not as a regular thing, maybe just that frowning one. home for Christmas again, I watched the ribbon of that ugly thing make like a serpent across black water one more time while riding home from the airport. Night gives it a break, I'll admit--at night all bridges are the same, just light. we had to see the place,  it had to be done.  Lynne drove. You'll like this, though: we got hysterical: someone had put up Christmas stuff in Glen Abbey, in full view of that chapel, your spot, cornball Liberty Lawn where the World War II veterans rot, and the shopping mall across the valley.  Reindeer, Santas and little creches in the middle of the cemetery. We raced back, in stitches, humming James Bond car-chase music between spasms.   That decade named for a pronoun was about good feelings, after all.  (That and bad taste.) So-- you would have liked it-- we did, I swear: Lynne gunned the engine coming off the light at the I-805 overpass, and we laughed all the way home.  1995-1997

						   Some thoughts Kelley wrote in his journal after reading Solomon Volkov's "Testimony," which purported to be the ghost-written memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.  This journal entry is dated April 28, 1982:  Last week I finished reading the Shostakovich-Volkov memoirs, and found them profoundly depressing.  They shared a similarity with Solzhenitsyn's writings in making an indictment of the Kremlin regime, but there the similarity ended.  For Solzhenitsyn, two steps to the right of Ivan the Terrible as he may be in some ways, at least believes in something. He's deeply religious, (which I suppose is a fundamental part of being two steps to the right of anybody) a practicing member of the Orthodox Church.  Shostakovich seemed to believe in nothing--not man, not God, not Stalin, not progress, nothing.  Even music, music which he must have loved and to which he presumably had a deep commitment, seems to have given him only fugitive consolations.  Music was music, it was joy, it was art, but it was not something you could pin hope or faith on; music couldn't DO anything; it just WAS.  This seems to have been Shostakovich's attitude, and it's a strange one, since in the Soviet Union so much music, and even much of Shostakovich's music in the war years, was made-to-order for propaganda purposes. 	 Shostakovich, whose refusal to write upbeat, optimistic music, fanfares and choruses of the "Onward, Communists" ilk made him a thorn in the Kremlin's side, consented during the war to do a certain amount of propagandizing in his music not because he loved the regime, but because he had that deep, utterly irrational mania for "The Motherland" that's so characteristic of Russians.   "The Motherland:" despite his repeated sufferings at the hands of bureaucrats and toadies, the public spanking which he, Prokofiev and other Soviet composers were forced to take from Stalin in 1937 (precipitated by Shostakovich's opera "Lady MacBeth of Mtsensk," which so offended Stalin's tin ear that he promptly dictated to one of his toadies an article entitled "Muddle Instead of Music," which appeared in Pravda and was the opening shot in the regime's ongoing campaign against "formalism") and the banning of his works repeatedly, the idea of leaving the USSR never occurred to Shostakovich.    In fact he had the oriental xenophobia about the West and things western which is as typical of the Russian mind as Russians' equally irrational fanatic patriotism, and probably has the same roots. Did his war propaganda music amount to hypocrisy? (The Seventh Symphony is the specific work I'm thinking of; there was the famous "battle" between Toscanini and Stokowski to see who would get to conduct its premiere, followed years later by Toscanini's wondering remark at hearing a recording of it, "How could I ever have conducted such trash?"  Glenn Gould has weighed in similarly, calling Shostakovich's 7th a "motoric monstrosity.") No. It wasn't hypocrisy any more than was Copland's "A Lincoln Portrait," written at about the same time. Russians, ordinary Russians, as much victims of Stalin as Shostakovich himself, were fighting and dying against Hitler's armies, and it was on their behalf, not Stalin's, that Shostakovich wrote such music.  Still, he struck me as having a rather primitive mind.  Contemptuous of western "humanists," whom he viewed as stupid dupes of Stalin's propaganda, and equally contemptuous of his contemporaries who became dissidents or criticized the regime, Shostakovich comes across in his memoirs (and indeed in much of his music) as an arrested adolescent.    Yes: there is, beneath all of the bitter-old-man grumbling that fills page after page of "Testimony," a strain of the rebellious, pig-headed teenager, the withdrawn loafer-about-the-halls who regards all of his classmates and teachers as idiots, and even resents the intrusion into his choleric solitude of those who may feel similarly about the system. The Fifth Symphony, the Eighth String Quartet and the Tenth Symphony (I'm using these examples because they're the only pieces of his I've heard lately) are all dramatic works, full of mockery, bitter bluster, and in the case of the quartet, some genuine and searingly intense moments of despair.  But the emotions seem exaggerated, raw, again, adolescent. Granted, this could be partly the result of Shostakovich's famous affinity for Mahler.  (Leonard Bernstein listed Shostakovich and Britten as composers who "are at their best when they are most like Mahler," and Stravinsky, upon meeting Shostakovich in Moscow in 1962, told Shostakovich that while he, Stravinsky, shared some of the latter's high regard for Mahler, he admonished the younger composer to "go beyond Mahler," by which presumably he meant on to Schoenberg, something Stravinsky should have known Shostakovich couldn't do, 12-tone music being forbidden in the USSR).    But in a deeper sense I think it stems from the same sort of primitive mentality (and by "primitive" I certainly don't mean unintelligent) that allowed Shostakovich to hate and despise Stalin and the whole government framework of ratfinks and asskissers, not to mention the secret police, and yet still resolutely refuse to even entertain the idea of leaving his beloved Rooshia for the wicked west, where the intellectual and artistic climate would have been freer, if perhaps somewhat more cluttered and certainly noisier. 	 It's noteworthy that Shostakovich sneers at Sakharov, whom he considers a hypocrite for having built Russia's H-bomb and then turned dissident against the powers who could use it.  It's also worth noting that he apparently didn't get along well with Solzhenitsyn, to whom he makes a few oblique references, calling the author of The Gulag Archipelago a "luminary" in the most sardonic of terms, and slyly depicting Solzhenitsyn as a pompous, holier-than-thou stuffed shirt, drunk with the feeling of his own importance and determined to lead Shostakovich away from the erroneous path of negativity.  Shostakovich implies that Solzhenitsyn berated him for having no faith in anything, and Shostakovich resented such a preachy attitude, as any teenage rebel with his hat on backwards would.  He might have admitted that Solzhenitsyn had actually done time in Stalin's labor camps, while he himself was never even arrested, and therefore Solzhenitsyn, should he so desire, had even more justification for being bitter about the regime and indeed about life itself than Shostakovich, but he chooses not to be gracious here. In fact graciousness doesn't come across as one of his virtues anywhere in this volume, though he does decry "rudeness" in other people, including Stalin himself and notably, Toscanini. 	 Shostakovich supposedly dictated the material that makes up his memoirs to Solomon Volkov, who made. S.'s ruminations into prose and got them published, ironically, in the west.  The writing of the book took place very late in Shostakovich's life (he died Aug. 9, 1975) and his outlook is as saturated with the fear of impending death as it is with bitterness toward all those who had made his life as a composer in the Soviet Union a Kafkaesque nightmare.    What an abyss to be facing: Shostakovich, a dutiful Communist and Soviet citizen despite his quarrels with Stalin and particularly with Stalin's revolting musical hatchet-man Khrennikov, had no shred of religion in him, was as emphatically positive that there is no afterlife as he was unsure, during his life, that he would live to see his next work performed.  What a spot to be in.  After an entire life of the bitterest kind, to contemplate a death that is the end of all, to have no hope of redemption or justification or salvation of any kind beyond the grave.    This actually suggests to me, once again, a kind of shallowness on Shostakovich's part, not courage. Not just because he lacked the imagination or the desire to believe in God or an afterlife, but because he lacked the imagination or the desire to believe in ANYTHING.  It's reasonable to expect that those who do not believe in God will substitute a belief in something else: John Reed, for example, had a faith in Bolshevism as childlike as any Sunday school child's faith in lamby Jesus.  But Shostakovich, while he dutifully liked to identify himself as a "proletarian," a "worker," gives no evidence anywhere in his memoirs of having a faith like Reed's that world revolution would indeed miraculously come along someday, turning the earth into a big Marxist day camp.    There isn't even any evidence here of the kind of hat-tipping lip-service that the poet Yevtushenko always made it a point to pay Lenin.  (With an eye, naturally, to Y's own continued prosperity under the system that made Lenin, in the words of one critic, "a cross between Abraham Lincoln and Santa Claus" to most Russians.)    There is in fact a complete absence of Communist buzzwords and Marxist-Leninist cliches in Shostakovich's remembrances: no "people's struggle," no "socialist destiny," no "western imperialism." (By contrast, you find plenty of this kind of stuff in Yevtushenko.) There is nothing in his book to indicate that his relationship with Marxist-Leninism, his "ideology" to use the word the Soviets like to equate with "virtue," is anything more than an acquiescence for the sake of peace, a mouthing of the appropriate words to keep the authorities off his back.  He certainly never became a Kremlin poster boy as Yevtushenko did, although they were friends and Shostakovich used Y.Y.'s poetry as the backbone of his Thirteenth Symphony.    If Yevtushenko disappointed western conservatives and Soviet liberals by turning away from human rights and more and more toward mouthing the party line in the years following Kruschschev's ouster in 1964, Shostakovich was a similar disappointment to Soviet conservatives, who like their art to be positive, up-beat, supportive of the government, easily accessible to the masses (meaning the bureaucrats, of course, with their lowbrow tastes).  What they wanted was of course Sound Effects for the Five-Year Plans, and Shostakovich would not give them that.  It wasn't because he wasn't an obedient Communist, but rather because he was melancholic, ascerbic and withdrawn by nature and he discovered, though he was slow to learn it, there there is no place in a totalitarian regime for anyone's personal foibles. Except maybe at the top. 	 Not everything in these memoirs is bitter, though.  There are many people whom Shostakovich remembers fondly and treats with respect, if not love.  One of them is Alexander Glazunov, the "Russian Brahms," as he is referred to in a footnote.  (If Glazunov's stature equals that of Brahms, it's only in the USSR; in the west he's regarded as a minor composer who lived at the same time as Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.)  Shostakovich liked him; he devotes a great deal of space in his book to singing Glazunov's praises, though his praise is for the man, not the music.  He seems to have regarded Glazunov's compositions as being every bit as mediocre as most of the world finds them.  Nevertheless, he assures us that Glazunov was a generous and effective teacher, despite being so deeply rooted in the past that he could not manage under the Soviet regime and retired to Paris, where he died in 1935. 	 But his warm memories of Glazunov are one square spot of sunshine on a floor that is otherwise mostly covered in shades of gloom.  To read Shostakovich's memoirs is to plumb the depths of a Dostoevskyan soul.  In fact, if I had to make a literary analogy with the two greatest composers Russia has produced in the last century, Shostakovich and Stravinsky, I could draw parallels with Dostoevsky and Chekhov, Shostakovich playing the former to Stravinsky's latter.  On the one hand, you have Dostoevsky-Shostakovich dealing in bombastic, highly personalized portraits of suffering.  Nearly all of Shostakovich's works, it's worth noting, have some kind of autobiographical program; if it's not actually printed on the album jacket, it's innate in the music.  Like Dostoevsky's, Shostakovich's art is not subtle, and whereas Dostoevsky is frequently accused of clumsy, ungrammatical, effusive writing, qualities redeemed of course by his raw power and insights into human torment, Shostakovich could be accused of something similar in his refusal to "go beyond Mahler," to reach beyond orchestral mood-painting and heart-on-sleeve expression of personal feelings to an art that speaks more for itself.  On the other hand you have Stravinsky, whose aesthetic was more chekhovian, i.e. a tad more "refrigerated."  Indeed Chekhov's own dictum about good writing was "it must be cold."  One of Stravinsky's most often-quoted statements was a reply he made to a questioner who asked what it is that music expresses.  "It can express nothing," he replied.  "It can express itself only."  In Chekhov's fiction the author is invisible; the characters act on their own, suffer on their own, triumph on their own, all without a trace of sentimentality or a "tortured glance into the soul" other than what the character himself might show.  So too, in Stravinsky's music, "emotion" is kept at arm's length.  The emotions are there, but expressed at a remove, through the application of various technical artifices. 	 The composer whom Shostakovich seems to love the most, to relate to on the most personal level, is Mussorgsky.  He even went so far as to make his own adaptation of "Boris Godunov."  It's not surprising, really: Mussorgsky was even more a "Dostoevsky" character than Shostakovich, not only an original, but a primitive--a genuine product of that Russian Soil to which Shostakovich had such an affective attachment.  And Shostakovich must have seen some parallels between Mussorgsky's miserable life (he drank himself to death) and his own (he was nearly hounded to death by the government, or so he would have his readers believe).    Misery is, in any case, the common denominator.  Misery and the love of music, whose own redemptive, regenerative or spiritual value (to use a term Shostakovich would have peremptorily rejected) is highly in question at the end of the book.  Or maybe looking at it that way is to miss the main point.  After all, Shostakovich wrote music all his life, and continued writing it right up until shortly before his death.  This in the face of Stalin, Zhdanov, Khrennikov, the purge trials, the KGB, Hitler...of what indeed seem in retrospect like all the forces of negativity swept into one vast, grotesquely unhappy country that covers one-sixth of the earth's surface.  In the face of all that, Shostakovich's despair, his utter lack of any belief, religious or otherwise, becomes less surprising.    What becomes surprising is that he produced so much music, and not all of it sardonic, mocking or full of despair.  There is humor in many of his works, the Second Piano Concerto for instance, and in fact one of the poems he set in his Thirteenth Symphony was Yevtushenko's "Ode to Humor."  His 24 preludes and fugues for piano have moments not only of humor, but even of profound joy.  How to explain it?  Perhaps there is no explanation.  Art grows in the most unlikely places; I remember reading of little drawings and paintings found in the ruins of Hitler's concentration camps, works of art produced by children waiting their turn to go to the ovens.  Art's existence isn't logical, surely, but then existence itself isn't.  But art's very existence is therefore a form of hope, a belief in tomorrow.  Maybe Shostakovich knew it and just wasn't telling.

						   From Kelley’s journal, November, 2003  Sometimes a confluence of events comes along and pokes me in a certain direction. It has happened occasionally throughout my life. And they don’t have to be big events, such as the loss of employment, followed by the failure, over the next few months, to find employment, followed in turn by a drive across America, my old 1990 Geo laden with my few pitiful possessions, as happened last spring.  They can be small events, like the reading of an essay following upon the heels of a conversation, followed by the rediscovery of an old, familiar volume. That, in fact, is what just happened, and as a result I feel that my life as a reader has been, in some small way, kick-started. In any case, after having eschewed fiction for a long time, I am reading again, in a tentative way. But throwing tentativeness in a sense to the breeze, I have undertaken a formidable project in that area: "Little Dorrit."  "Little Dorrit?" Yeah. For most of my adult life, indeed, for most of my life as a reader, I have had an allergy to the Victorians. All that windiness, all that length, all that prudery, hypocrisy, imperial smugness. Who needed it? Twenty-some years ago, Ray Araiza used to tease me about my proud claim that “I don’t read the Victorians.” Hemingway and his generation had fought the good fight to liberate American literature from the stranglehold of Britannia. I was their heir, or so I thought. What did I need with Dickens, Thackeray and company?  Well, the journey to "Little Dorrit" actually had its earliest beginning in September, 2001, just days before the terrorist attacks of that year. Tatiana Floyd (Russian-born, six feet tall, 150 pounds, and an avid photographer) and I were driving from Baltimore to Boston for the Labor Day weekend.   We took along some books on tape to listen to in the car during the eight-hour haul up Interstate 95, one of which was a collection of short pieces by Tom Wolfe, "Hooking Up."   One of the essays on that tape concerned the brouhaha which followed the publication in 1998 of Wolfe’s novel "A Man In Full." Specifically, the fuss that three famous, and jealous, fellow-writers kicked up over its success. Norman Mailer, John Updike and John Irving all went on television at different times to trash "A Man In Full," Mailer claiming that it was “journalism” and not fiction, (he ought to know about that!) and Updike stuffily asserting that it wasn’t a product of “our” literary culture.    But John Irving outdid his two fellow sniffers: in an appearance on Canadian TV, the jealous author so lost control of himself on the subject of "A Man In Full" that he was liberally using the “F” word. And here’s the rub in the case of Irving’s on-the-air tantrum: Wolfe mentioned that some reviewers of "A Man In Full" had compared it with Dickens, and that was what really got Irving’s goat: Irving, it seems, is a great admirer of Dickens, who would like to be compared with Dickens himself. To see Wolfe compared with Dickens drove John Irving into “F-word” convulsions in a TV interview.  This intrigued me. What possible attraction, I wondered, could Dickens have for the author of "The World According To Garp" and ""The Cider-House Rules?" I would think that two more dissimilar writers couldn’t be imagined. The idea was tucked away in my memory under “curiosities from the world of book-chat.”  Then, maybe three weeks ago, I was picking through "Something To Remember Me By," a volume of short fiction by Saul Bellow. Bellow wrote an introduction to this tryptich of novellas, the theme of the introduction being precisely this fact, that they were novellas as opposed to novels. He discussed our general failure in recent years to make as much time for reading as people used to, hence a general trend to make fiction shorter than it used to be. I don’t remember the exact context, but as an illustration of the sort of long novel to which people no longer want to bother making a commitment of time and effort, Bellow specifically cited "Little Dorrit."   Item filed, note with question attached: why "Little Dorrit?" Dickens wrote plenty of long novels. Why didn’t Bellow cite "Bleak House" or "The Pickwick Papers?" It seems to me that they are both generally better known.  Next came my conversation at Marie Callender’s last Wednesday night with Jan Barnett. Jan told me over soup and buffalo wings that she was endeavoring to stake out some time in her life these days for the things she considers important, not the least of which is reading. When she mentioned that she was reading some of the short stories of Colette, it was like someone had tossed a glass of cold water in my lap. I suddenly found myself thinking back to my college days, or at least to Jan’s, when we were all, each in our own way, so interested in literature that we were reading like fiends. In my case the drive was especially strong because I wanted to be a writer, wanted it worse than anything, and of course as my erstwhile teacher Don Baird had said to me when I was 18, “As for writing yourself, keep reading. Sure, all writers are readers.”   From my teens until I was about forty, it seems I was always reading something, usually something from the “western canon,” e.g. something from the entire pantheon of serious western literature, running the gamut from Homer to Tolstoy, from Thomas Mann to Saul Bellow. (For the most part steering clear of the Victorians, except for Oscar Wilde, who flouted their conventions.) But as my forties progressed and the realization that I was not, after all, going to be a Hemingway or a Henry Miller or even a W.H. Auden began to coalesce in real time like a photograph in the darkroom becoming ever-sharper, my interest in reading great literature gradually began to fade, to extend the simile, like an old Polaroid. Now here’s Jan, who by the way has earned my admiration for the graceful way in which she has accepted her own version of my experience: when she was in college, Jan dreamed of becoming a great artist. She knows now that she probably isn’t going to be the next Georgia O’Keeffe, but she has accepted the fact with equanimity, still enjoys drawing, and by the way, is trying to block out time these days for such things as reading the short stories of Colette. Noted and filed.    Next, just yesterday morning in fact, I was reading an essay by critic Sven Birkerts in a book of his that Lucia gave me, "Readings." The essay, "Against The Current," concerned itself with Birkert’s experience—and, by extension, our experience generally—of “losing touch” with the world of close reading and the sparks it can cause to fly, thanks mostly to the way our postmodern perceptions have been totally taken over and reshaped, even redefined, by the all-pervading ocean of electronic media in which we spend every moment of our waking lives these days. Using as a starting point his self-described inability to read and appreciate poetry as he once did, Birkerts moves on to a detailed discussion, first of how his—our—altered modes of perception have endangered the attentiveness needed for reading, and then to details of some of the small steps he has taken to try and recover some of that, chiefly by making the sacrifice of doing some things in a deliberately slower, less “efficient” manner than they are usually done these days: writing letters with a pen rather than a computer, and then taking the time to walk to the mailbox to mail them, noticing things around him on the way. Slowing down, in other words, and tuning in while at the same time tuning out.  All of these little experiences brought me to a decision: I was going to read "Little Dorrit." Yesterday afternoon I got in the car and drove over to the Chula Vista Public Library to see if it was on the shelf. I knew that it probably would be; after all, who reads "Little Dorrit" anymore?  And then, as I was entering the library on this mission of reading, another tiny fillip of experience occured, a sort of closing-the-circle gesture on the part of the gods, which, come to think of it, could not have been more perfect had it been scripted for the occasion.   The library’s little used bookstore, tucked away in one corner of the main library, is open on Saturday afternoons. I seldom go in there, because they seldom have anything that catches my interest and anyway, in my current living circumstances I don’t have much room for storing books.   But as I wandered into the little shop yesterday, and browsed around the cramped shelves, I spotted an old friend: "Literature: Structure, Sound and Sense," by Laurence Perrine. (Harcourt, Brace & World, © 1956, 1959, 1963, 1966, 1969, 1970.) This was the very textbook that we used in Donald S. Baird’s English 6 class, “Composition and Literature,” Southwestern College, fall semester, 1973. (MWF 8:00-8:50 a.m.—Imagine discussing T.S. Eliot at eight O’clock in the morning! Still, we did.)  I was 18, it was my first semester of college, and this textbook, along with Baird’s own curmudgeonly pontificatings, was a key factor in the shaping of my own tastes in poetry and fiction during the years that followed. (Baird’s greatest gift to me was Yeats. He could be a little prick, but he did me that favor.)   Donald S. Baird is probably dead by now. And there was that book. Did I say “the gods?” More likely, Baird’s own curmudgeonly little ghost patting my butt as I entered the library in search of Dickens, giving his seal of approval to the quest. As I recall, the cost of this textbook in 1973 was $10. I got it back yesterday for 75¢. It, and "Lake Woebegon Days" by Garrison Keillor, and yes, "The Mill On The Floss" by George Eliot, eminent Victorian. Total for all three: $1.75.       The library’s two copies of "Little Dorrit" were both in—surprise!—in fact I had my choice between the one in old blue library binding and the one in old red library binding. Both are slightly yellowed and just a shade tattered. I chose the red one: New York, Dodd, Mead & Co. 1951.  As of this morning, I have read up to Chapter Seven. It’s going to be a long journey, as Saul Bellow promised it would be; I’m on page 64 of a book that runs 788 pages. And so thoroughly has the world changed between Dickens’ time and our own that I am already having occasional trouble “taking his sense,” not so much with regard to the language as to the sensibilities of his characters. The Victorians’ shared system of values and beliefs, not to mention their customs, bore little resemblance to whatever shared system of beliefs we have left in the age of the Internet. But no matter, it is giving me a warm feeling in the gut to begin this long journey, and I am determined to see what lies at the other end.   II   Two weeks ago I announced in these pages that I had decided to read "Little Dorrit" by Charles Dickens. I’m just about halfway through it now, a few pages short of finishing Part One. What are my impressions of the book so far? Well, right off, I can see why some reviewers compared Wolfe’s "A Man In Full"  with Dickens. An argument could indeed be made that Dickens was the Tom Wolfe of his day, or Tom Wolfe the Dickens of ours. Michael Burgess and I were discussing Dickens and my decision to read Little Dorrit the other day. “Dickens was a journalist,” Michael remarked. Indeed he was, in the same sense that Balzac and Zola were journalists. The landscape of London at the beginning of the industrial revolution was what Dickens painted, and he was always exposing the social ills of his era; "Little Dorrit’s" particular target is the institution of debtor’s prison. In the custom of that time, his novels were serialized in magazines before they appeared between covers, so he was indeed writing for a popular audience. Novels don’t get serialized in magazines anymore, but Wolfe was a magazine journalist before he began writing books. The parallels are easy to draw, which makes me wonder about John Irving’s hissy-fit on Canadian TV.  An American reader in the early twenty-first century can’t help but find Dickens a little verbose. It isn’t just because we don’t read long books anymore, either. Both journalism and prose fiction have become noticeably less long-winded in the past 100 years. As a journalist and one who has studied the history of journalism as well as of literature, I can testify that as you progress from 1900 to 2000 in reading newspaper articles, you’ll find them progressively less and less “wordy” until you reach today’s journalism, which is so terse by comparison with earlier eras as to seem like shorthand. When I pick up a newspaper article written at the time of World War I, I’m aware that I’m reading prose. Ornate sentences, carefully crafted. Curlicues of simile and metaphor. It’s obvious that some of these guys were writing with pen and paper, not typewriters. In fact it wasn’t until the 1960s that this kind of thing finally disappeared. As the newspaper market shrank, newspaper writing became less and less distinguishable. Journalism isn’t crafted at all anymore, unless you’re talking about the opinion columnists. Journalism today is churned out as product. Pick up the front page of any major newspaper and the reporting of any two journalists will read pretty much like the reporting of any other two. Formulaic, brief and to the point.  Of course Dickens wasn’t writing newspaper stories, he was writing fiction. But he was writing in a leisurely, mannered style which was the norm of his day and not of ours, whether you’re talking about journalism or fiction. Leisurely, mannered prose fiction was precisely what people like Hemingway, Nathanael West and Raymond Chandler were trying to get away from. They, and their contemporaries, laid the ground rules for the kind of fiction we’re used to reading now: pithy, from the hip. Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy, in fact, have taken this postmodern stuff so far that their prose resembles Marlon Brando’s mumbling. That's the stylistic half of the equation: the other half is the length issue, an outgrowth of our "eight second sound bite" culture.  I found DeLillo's "Underworld" a bit of a long haul, but it's definitely against the grain: Oprah's Book Club features a lot of McBooks that can be tossed off in an afternoon, although some contemporary authors, even some who pre-date DeLillo's efforts in the 1990's, have gone out of their way to be unaccomodating to our short attention spans: I think of Pynchon, Barth and somewhat more closer to our own time Vikram Seth, whose "A Suitable Boy" was such a massive edifice of the now-nearly-defunct "Bildungsroman" genre that it drew comparisons with Goethe and Tolstoy from the British critics in when it was published in 1991. (And it sank like a rock nonetheless: Goethe and Tolstoy notwithstanding, it was on the remainder tables within six months.) I think even of Garcia Marquez, who dispensed with paragraphs in "The Autumn of the Patriarch."    But these are acts of intentional obtuseness: guys like Dickens and Henry James were long-winded because that was what their audience expected, not the opposite. They weren’t flying in the face of anything.  And then there is the question of what used to be called “sensibility.” The 19th century was (I should say, is) infamous for its sentimentality. From the time of Rousseau until the massive global disllusionment engendered by World War I, public taste tended toward bathos and tears. “Feeling is all,” Goethe said in "Faust," and he may have meant it ironically, but he wasn’t kidding. For a century, novelists, poets and playwrights laid it on with a trowel, which is why we find so many of them unreadable now. "Uncle Tom’s Cabin" was credited by no less than Abraham Lincoln with being no less than the spark that started the American Civil War, but today one can’t read it without laughing.  I’m not comparing Harriet Beecher Stowe with Dickens, but I am saying that the “sensibility” of the mid-19th century tended to favor scenes and characterizations which today we would consider mawkish. Snapshot from memory: my 10th grade English teacher, Mrs. Terry, (who was very much a child of the “hip” 1960s) mercilessly ridiculing Longfellow’s "The Wreck of the Hesperus" for its gooey sentiment. Again, I’m using an extreme example: Longfellow is a second-rate poet. But my point is that you do find in Dickens, or I do anyway, some undeniable traces of this pandering to the “sensibilities” of his time which can make some of his characters seem a little unbelievable to modern readers. Little Dorrit, so christlike in her self-sacrificing, so relentlessly sweet, humble and devoted to her father, looks to me like Mary Pickford hamming it up in a silent film. Arthur Clenham is a painfully nice guy who, in the manner of his time, goes around acting like he has no dick. Even when he falls in love with Pet, he tries to persuade himself that he hasn’t. God forbid that any Victorian should admit having a dick. (Curious, or perhaps not quite so curious after all, is the existence, of which we are now fully aware, of a very active and fecund pornographic sub-culture in Victorian England, of which “My Secret Life” and “The Pearl” are two famous examples.)  But having said all that, there is a great deal about "Little Dorrit" that has a contemporary ring. England no longer has debtor’s prison, but reading about it reminds me of how thoroughly our American attitudes toward fortune and misfortune have been influenced by those of our sister-culture on the other side of the pond.  Last week I was recounting for our publisher, Linda Rosas, my interview and subsequent e-mail communication with a woman whose life has so totally careened out of control in the past few years that she is now a desolate case, crying for help to the local newspaper. “We all choose our path in life,” Linda said breezily, and as far as she was concerned, the subject was closed. I couldn’t help thinking of the scene in Roman Polanski’s "Tess," which was of course based on "Tess of the d’Urbervilles" by eminent Victorian Thomas Hardy, in which some casual passerby remarks of Tess’ misfortunes, “It’s yer own fault.”   There you go. W.H. Auden pointed out in one of his essays that it’s no accident Catholic countries gave us almshouses, while Protestant countries gave us debtor’s prison. Catholic culture is (or was, anyway) untouched by the influence of John Calvin, whose doctrine of predestination added up, in the countries where Protestantism triumphed, to a prevailing idea that you could be as selfish and self-centered as you pleased, while continuing to think that God was smiling on you. Since everyone was predestined, before the Creation, to be either damned or saved, it was a sign of God’s grace if you were well-off and prosperous in this world, and a sign of His disfavor if you’re poor or down-and-out.   It’s a short leap from there to the idea that there is something shameful about being poor. There are countries in the world where begging is an honorable profession. But that’s not the case in England and it is certainly not the case in America. In our Anglo-American culture, even to be unemployed is a kind of blot on your character. I know, I’ve been there. The sight of the Dorrit family languishing in the Marshalsea, with Dorrit’s elder daughter, Fanny, forced to work as a dancer and at the same time hissing and spitting at anyone whom she perceives as casting aspersions on her family's status in society, is a sharp reminder of where all of this came from. Admittedly, I cannot relate to Fanny’s, or her father’s, anxiety over word getting out that any member of their family has been actually forced to work for a living, she as a dancer and Little Dorrit as a seamstress. We don’t have quite that level of class snobbery here: America does have its rich class, as most countries do, but it doesn’t have an idle rich class, as England once did, a landed gentry that considered it shameful to soil its hands with any kind of labor. But pride and hubris are themes that cut to the bone in American fiction just as they do in Dickens, both fictions growing from societies in which money success (America) or preserving one’s position in society (England) are the terms that delineate the good life. Small wonder Wolfe made the critics think of Dickens when he created Charlie Croker and company. We might not sing songs like "Wait Till The Sun Shines, Nellie" or "Don’t You Remember Sweet Alice?" anymore, but Dickens and Wolfe were definitely mining the same vein.

						   					I  Homing To The Stream : Ernest Hemingway and Cuba    Born and reared in the suburbs of Chicago, Ernest Hemingway was a product of the American heartland who, once he got out of it, never wanted to have much to do with the American heartland again. Aside from a few of his earliest short stories, which in any case are set in upper Michigan rather than suburban Illinois, Hemingway never published a word about where he came from, nor did he ever go back for long.   There are as many possible explanations for this as there are biographies of Hemingway. Some have suggested that Hemingway, like others of his generation who lived as expatriates in Europe after World War I, found the provincialism and narrow-mindedness of middle America stultifying. Unlike most of his fellow expats, however, Hemingway never went home. After leaving his birthplace of Oak Park, Illinois in the fall of 1921 with his new bride, Elizabeth Hadley Richardson, Hemingway spent the rest of his life either outside the United States or on the periphery of its life, in places like the Florida Keys, the upper plains states, (he enjoyed Montana and Wyoming for their hunting) the Pacific northwest, specifically Idaho, where he ended his life in 1961...and Cuba. Given the enormously complex relationship that Hemingway had with his family, particularly with his demanding and overbearing mother, whom he repeatedly and for years denounced as a "bitch" to anyone who would listen, it's possible that Hemingway simply wanted to give the midwest a "wide berth" because that was where his mother was until her own death in 1951.   Shortly before Ernest and Hadley were married in September, 1921, Hadley had said to Ernest, "The world's a jail and we're gonna break it together." They were young--he was 22 on their wedding day; she was not quite 30--and deeply in love; in later years, after later marriages, Hemingway would suggest that Hadley was the only woman whom he had ever truly loved. But, although he was at heart a romantic, and conventional enough a midwesterner in his heart to feel that any time he fell in love with a woman, he ought to marry her, Hemingway couldn't be monogamous. His friend and fellow author Scott Fitzgerald (who managed to remain married to the same woman until he died, even though his wife, Zelda Sayre, was mentally unstable, Fitzgerald himself was an alcoholic and their marriage was a long, stormy melodrama) predicted quite early on that Hemingway was going to require "a new wife for each book," a remark which turned out to be quite prescient, and the course of Hemingway's four marriages also took him to Cuba and lodged him there--he ultimately made Cuba the most permanent home he would ever make of any place.  Hemingway's trek south began in 1927, when he and Hadley divorced over his affair with wealthy Arkansas socialite and magazine journalist Pauline Pfeiffer, who promptly became the second Mrs. Hemingway. One thing Hemingway would never do with his wives, until his fourth and last one anyway, was to subject the new wife to living in the venue of the old. Ernest and Hadley's marriage had centered upon Paris, where he struggled in the early-to-mid 1920s to get his writing career started.   With the end of his first marriage, Hemingway's affection for Paris declined temporarily, and another friend and fellow novelist, John Dos Passos, suggested to him that Key West, Florida might be a good place for him to relocate.   In 1928, when Hemingway and Pauline went to live there in a house that her wealthy Uncle Gus had given them as a wedding present, Key West was a sleepy, run-down fishing village at the end of the Keys southwest of Miami. Prohibition was still in effect, and among Key West's attractions for the notoriously-bibulous Hemingway may well have been that its very position on the periphery of America made prohibition little more than a word there.  Smuggled liquor from Cuba was easy to get, and the island had plenty of its own sources of bathtub booze as well. Key West was popular with the artistic and literary crowd already; poet Wallace Stevens was among those who spent time there.  Pauline and Ernest set up housekeeping in Key West and Ernest, who already had one son from his marriage with Hadley, soon had two more.   Every tourist who's ever gone to Key West to take pictures of Hemingway's house there knows that Sloppy Joe's Bar was his favorite Key West hangout. He quickly made friends with its owner, Joe Russell, described by Hemingway biographer Michael Reynolds as "a salty, red-faced bootlegger who was the real thing." Russell had a boat for fishing, the “Anita,” and he and Hemingway often went out on fishing expeditions in it, some of which lasted for days.   One such expedition took place in the spring of 1932. Pauline had given birth to Hemingway's third and final son the previous November. Hemingway wasn't happy about becoming a father again, and the birth put further strain on what was already a strained relationship--Pauline's family's money had been largely responsible for freeing Ernest from the necessity to write journalism for a living, enabling him to devote himself exclusively to fiction, and he was not a man to be comfortable with owing anyone anything.   Partly to get away from the strained relationship and partly to get away from the sound of a crying baby, Hemingway went off with Russell in April of that year on another fishing trip. They sailed to Havana for what was supposed to be a two-day stay. In the end, they stayed four months.   Hemingway had seen Havana once before, when he and Pauline had made a stop-off there on their way to Key West from France in 1928. But Havana had new attractions for him now, not the least of which was 22 year-old Jane Mason, the wife of the head of Pan American Airways in Cuba. They began an affair as Hemingway took up extended residence at what would be his base in Havana for the next several years, the Hotel Ambos Mundos. In the spring of the following year, as his second marriage continued to unravel, Hemingway was in Havana for another extended stay, and once again Jane Mason was in the picture. Pauline, sensing trouble, used the excuse of the annual visit of Hemingway's son  from his first marriage, Jack, (known as Bumby) to come over from Key West as she brought the boy to Havana to spend time with his father. But Hemingway made it plain that he didn't want her around, and she soon went back to Key West alone.   Hemingway and Mason talked of getting married, but it never happened. Instead, back in Key West in 1936, he met Martha Gellhorn, a vivacious and attractive blonde and fellow author/journalist with whom he would soon share a hotel room in Madrid while they were both covering the Spanish Civil War as correspondents, and who would become the third Mrs. Hemingway in 1940. Pauline was a devout Catholic who did not take divorce lightly, but after much wrangling, she finally agreed to divorce Ernest so he could marry Martha. The divorce became final in November, 1940, and Hemingway and Gellhorn were married that same month.   The house in Key West had been a gift from Pauline's family; obviously Ernest and Martha weren't going to live there, although he remained generally on good terms with Pauline and they did sometimes visit. The logical place for the newlyweds to settle after their Hawaiian honeymoon was the city that had virtually been Ernest's home away from home for about eight years already: Havana.   Aside from the fact that he had already established in Havana what's known in the world of bullfighting as a “querencia”—-the part of the ring where the bull feels at home—-there were other reasons for Hemingway to like Havana. During the years of the Grau and Batista regimes that preceded the rule of Fidel Castro, Havana was something of a playground for the wealthy of America's east coast (some have called it "America's brothel.") Havana was a good place to have a good time, and Hemingway liked a good time. His years in Key West had already given him a taste for tropical ambience. Naturally sloppy in his personal habits, (Martha Gellhorn casually nicknamed him "Pig") he liked a place where he could go around in shorts and loose-fitting shirts all the time. His outings aboard the “Anita” with Joe Russell had given Hemingway a passion for deep-sea fishing, and the Gulf Stream, adjacent to Cuba, offered the best marlin fishing in the world. Always fond of blood sports, Hemingway discovered and became an enthusiastic follower of cockfighting in Havana, and there was also the less-bloody, if for its human participants more dangerous, sport of Jai Alai, another amusement of which Hemingway became a devoted aficionado.   Martha had joined Hemingway in Havana the year before they were married, but she was not about to share a small, dirty room at the Hotel Ambos Mundos with him. Looking in a newspaper, she found a 15-acre estate about 15 miles from downtown Havana called the "Finca Vigia" ("Lookout Farm.") The place was badly dilapidated and Hemingway thought it not even worth trying to renovate, but Martha saw it as a challenge and hired workers at her own expense to get the place into liveable shape.   At first they rented the farm for $100 a month, but in December, 1940  after they were married, Hemingway bought the Finca Vigia for $18,500. It was the first home he had ever owned that hadn't been given to him by someone else, and he "settled" there to the extent that a man as restless as Ernest Hemingway could settle anywhere. The Finca provided a spacious, quiet place for him to work. It had a swimming pool and tennis court, and Hemingway's myriad cats and dogs wandered freely about the place. Soon he was a regular fixture at Havana's Floridita bar, where he could be seen downing ice-cold dacquiris in his own reserved seat at the end of the bar.   But the Hemingway-Gellhorn marriage was as doomed as his two previous ones. Indeed, Martha had expressed misgivings to a friend before her marriage to Ernest as to how  things would work out between them. Both of Hemingway's first two wives had been older than he was, she pointed out, while she was nine years his junior. Martha was less than enthusiastic about assuming the role of housekeeper, and Hemingway's mercurial temper, often exacerbated by drinking, increased tensions. Martha later decried her husband's "ceaseless, crazy bullying" of her. There is also some evidence, perhaps not surprising in view of the fact that Martha was the first of Ernest's wives to be younger than he, that they were sexually incompatible.   Then World War II came along and invaded what was already less than Eden. Hemingway had already been directly or indirectly involved in four wars: World War I; the 1922 war between Greece and Turkey; the Spanish Civil War and, most recently, the Japanese war in China, which he and Martha had gone off to cover as correspondents shortly after their marriage. He was inclined to sit this one out, although in 1943 German U-boats were slipping into the Gulf of Mexico to torpedo American and Venezuelan shipping, and Hemingway saw an opportunity to participate in war without having to stray too far from home. By now he had his own fishing boat, the “Pilar,” and with the connivance of the American ambassador in Havana, Spruille Braden, Hemingway embarked on a slightly-crackpot "U-boat hunting" scheme--he had the “Pilar” outfitted with machine guns and ammunition, rounded up a crew and made a number of patrols in the Gulf Stream looking for German subs. (They never found one.) Beyond such Huck Finn shenanigans, Hemingway inclined toward staying home in Cuba as the war in Europe raged.   Martha had no such inclination. She was an ambitious writer who loved her work, and was not going to be content with sitting around the Finca Vigia being Mrs. Hemingway when the whole world was at war. She went off to cover the war as a correspondent for Collier's magazine, and Hemingway was eventually cajoled into doing likewise. In 1944 he went to London, his first stop toward becoming Colliers' front-line correspondent after the Normandy invasion, at which he was present.   His marriage to Martha was already in trouble, and the war finished it off—in London he met yet another woman journalist, Mary Welsh, who would become the fourth and last Mrs. Hemingway. In 1946 he brought her to the Finca Vigia, where she became the somewhat-uneasy but increasingly confident mistress of the place.  Mary  did, unlike her predecessor Martha, go to great lengths to make the Finca a "home," although for the footloose Hemingway "home" seldom meant much more than a base for periods between arrivals and departures. Mary put in a great deal of work maintaining flower and vegetable gardens on the property and went to great pains with the upkeep of the decaying house while also having to work around her husband's less-than-fastidious personal habits and coexisting with a menagerie of cats, dogs and other animals on the property. Years earlier, Pauline Pfeiffer had tried to keep Hemingway close by giving him a decent home in Key West; Mary Welsh in the 1940s and '50s made similar efforts in Cuba for a man now in his fifties and aging quickly, with a list of physical and mental ailments that would mount and mount over the years, making their life together on the island as stormy as the previous Hemingway marriages.   Hemingway would make Cuba his base of operations for the remaining years of his life, although, because he craved both audiences and excitement, he and Mary  would often leave their somewhat-remote tropical outpost for sojourns in the United States, Europe and Africa.   Then, in 1959, Fidel Castro came to power. For most Americans living in Havana, the Communist takeover amounted to a klaxon horn sounding Abandon Ship. But Hemingway chose to stay on. He had been fully aware of the corruption and abuses of the previous regimes and, naive about Communism, felt he had no reason not to accept Castro as a welcome reformer. He went so far as to wish Castro "all luck" with running the country, an attitude which didn't do much to endear Hemingway to either the U.S. government or to the FBI. In fact, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had been "keeping an eye" on Hemingway ever since the sub-hunting adventure of the early forties, and Hemingway's mounting paranoia in his later years about FBI surveillance was not entirely without basis in fact. (Castro returned Hemingway's compliment, by the way--since Hemingway's death, the author has been a much-honored cultural hero in Cuba, the government maintaining his house as a museum and even having the “Pilar” transported overland to be the museum's chief attraction.)   People did sometimes ask Hemingway why he chose to live in Cuba. Late in 1948 he wrote an article for Holiday magazine in which he talked about his life there, offering his readers verbal snapshots of cool mornings at the Finca, cockfights and pigeon shoots, but most importantly the incomparable marlin fishing in the Gulf Stream, which he lovingly called "the Great Blue River." It was not only in journalism, but in his often less-than-successful later fictions that Hemingway's attractions toward this part of the world are apparent. In his 1937 "proletarian" novel “To Have And Have Not” Hemingway displayed his affection for the seamy side of Havana life, and on one level his late novella “The Old Man And The Sea” could be read as a lyrical tribute to the Gulf Stream. His posthumous novel “Islands In The Stream,” cobbled together in 1970 from a huge pile of manuscript that he churned out between 1946 and 1950, while it may be unbearably talky in places, is in other places a moving tribute to the Caribbean world--and to Cuba. Hear Hemingway in that novel use his unmatched gift for evoking topography to share with his readers what was, unquestionably, a longstanding love-of-place:   “He got into the car and told the chauffeur to go up O'Reilly to the Floridita. Before the car circled the plaza in front of the embassy building and the Ayuntamiento and then turned into O'Reilly he saw the size of the waves in the mouth of the harbor and the heavy rise and fall of the channel buoy. In the mouth of the harbor the sea was very wild and confused and clear green water was breaking over the rock at the base of the Morro, the tops of the seas blowing white in the sun.   It looks wonderful, he said to himself. It not only looks wonderful, it is wonderful.”   II  Hemingway and Turgenev: A Brief Introduction  One has to be very careful taking Ernest Hemingway at his word. Fiction was his metier, and one of the dictionary definitions of fiction is "something invented or imagined." The impulse to embellish was powerful in him. Hemingway seldom let facts get in the way of a good story, either on paper or while entertaining a crowd at lunch. Add mental breakdown, alcoholism, repeated head injuries and depression to that tendency, and you have some of the reasons why “A Moveable Feast,” Hemingway's memoir of his life in Paris with his first wife during the early 1920s, is undeniably a wonderful "read," (I fell in love with this book, and with Hemingway's art, when I was 16) but it's also a book that has to be taken not just with any grain of salt, but with a grain of the kind of salt they use to de-ice freeways.   And not only did Hemingway love to embroider around facts, but like many self-educated men, he wore his erudition on his sleeve. We sometimes forget that before the end of World War II and the advent of the G.I. bill, a college education was not considered a universal entitlement in America, nor was it necessarily something that everyone felt they had to have.   Hemingway was offered the chance to go to college--his father had wanted him to attend Oberlin--but he decided he'd rather go out and get educated in the business of life instead, first as an ambulance driver in the First World War, and then as a reporter on the Kansas City and Toronto Star newspapers. (In the early 20th Century a young man could still walk in off the street with a personal recommendation and begin working as a reporter on a big-city newspaper, but the age of the "cub reporter" is as long gone now as is the age of the volunteer ambulance driver.)   Hemingway educated himself in literature not by attending seminars and writing research papers, but by reading, and throughout his life he loved to list the authors he had read, or claimed to have read, for the commiseration of the reading public, although he always got very touchy when anyone dared whisper the word "influence." He had sufficient perspective to generously acknowledge his admiration for the "big guns"—-his near-reverence for Shakespeare and Tolstoy was never alloyed with irony—-but when it came to lesser, or God forbid, contemporary influences, friends and associates had to step carefully around him. With his enormous ego and extreme competitiveness, Hemingway was not one to be generous to colleagues, and the surest way to get him to turn on you, as Gertrude Stein and Sherwood Anderson found out the hard way, was to help him out. Hemingway simply wasn't comfortable with owing anyone anything, and most certainly not with anything having to do with style. Perhaps that's not surprising in view of the way Hemingway's style co-opted his personality, (or perhaps it was the other way around.) In any case, identifying the influences on Hemingway has amounted to a full-time job for scholars and critics for decades.   Nevertheless, when he began assembling the sketches for “A Moveable Feast” circa 1957, Hemingway's need to show the world the breadth of his youthful reading centered largely around the great Russians: Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Turgenev, and also Gogol and Chekhov. Hemingway stood in awe of Tolstoy and was fascinated by the emotional battering-rams in Dostoevski, but ultimately it was Turgenev, among the Russians anyway, who played a role in shaping Hemingway's famous style.  Tolstoy's impact on Hemingway is as hard to ignore as an iceberg--after all, no one has ever written on the subject of war with anything close to the sweep and depth of Tolstoy, and war was a subject that Hemingway found endlessly fascinating. Admiration for Tolstoy was a "natural" for him.   Dostoevski, too, deeply interested him, if only because he reports himself wondering aloud to the poet Evan Shipman how Dostoevski could "write…so unbelievably badly, and make you feel so deeply." In the Paris sketch in which he describes his first visit to Sylvia Beach's famous bookstore, Shakespeare and Company, Hemingway lists Dostoevski's “The Gambler and Other Stories" as one of the volumes he first borrowed, along with “War and Peace,” some D.H. Lawrence and “A Sportsman's Sketches” by Ivan Turgenev.   Another name might be mentioned in this context, that of Henry James. Hemingway's admiration for Henry James was equivocal; according to "A Moveable Feast," James was the favorite author of Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, and Hemingway had sufficient taste and intelligence, self-educated or not, to acknowledge James as a classic. But James' highly stylized, mannered prose was worlds away from what Hemingway would soon be trying to do with short sentences, and James' world of elegant drawing rooms, English lawns and upper-class parlors was continents away from Hemingway's world of battlegrounds, bullrings and African hills. When it came to subject matter, Joseph Conrad was more to Hemingway's taste. But perhaps most importantly, when it came to style, James was a practitioner, in fact the very epitome, of the late 19th-century's idea of good writing: the highly-polished "polite prose" that Hemingway decided he had to get  away from.   So, ironically, was Turgenev, whom Hemingway embraced as a master.   And indeed, Turgenev and James are similar writers in some ways: although Turgenev wrote in Russian and James in English, both men spent much of their adult lives living outside their country of birth, and both wrote in an elegant, consciously literary style that doesn't appeal to everyone. Oscar Wilde once remarked that James wrote prose "as if it were a painful duty," and to this day it is fashionable among bookish Russians to deride Turgenev as "feminine" owing chiefly to the elegance and grace of what many regard as overpolished prose. And because I have heard Turgenev accused of being "feminine" more than once, I find it ironic that he should have influenced the machismo--obsessed Hemingway, with his laconic tough-guy characters who speak in tight-lipped bursts.   And yet, if you take a look at that very book of Turgenev's that Hemingway reports having borrowed from Sylvia Beach in 1922, “A Sportsman's Sketches”, and then glance through Hemingway's first widely-read book of short fiction, “In Our Time,” a few of Turgenev's fingerprints do indeed seem to appear on Hemingway's pages. The most powerful influences on the style that Hemingway evolved in the early 1920s may well have been, as has been often pointed out, the Kansas City Star's stylebook, with its emphasis on keeping things short, clipped and free of adjectives, and Gertrude Stein, whose mammoth novel “The Making of Americans” Hemingway helped to type and whose "cubistic" approach to prose, repeating phrases over and over with slightly different wordings, doubtlessly influenced Hemingway's sense of prose rhythm. But Turgenev, too, is part of the mix, and Hemingway certainly never made his admiration for Turgenev a secret. In 1925 he told Archibald MacLeish that he thought Turgenev "the greatest writer there ever was," and then added "’War and Peace’ is the best book I know, but imagine what a book it would have been if Turgenev had written it."  Tolstoy had dazzled Hemingway by writing dazzlingly about war. Joseph Conrad, like Herman Melville before him, had been a sailor, and many of his tales center around the adventurous and--at least in those days, manly--world of the sea. Turgenev, in “A Sportsman's Sketches,” creates a world—-albeit a peculiarly Russian one-—around a man who spends all of his time indulging his greatest passion, which also happened to be one of Hemingway's: hunting. I think that, with regard to Turgenev, this was the hook that drew Hemingway in. But once he was there, within Turgenev's world, Hemingway took something else away with him besides the enjoyment of a string of vignettes about a man out hunting and communing with his land and people along the way.  “A Sportsman's Sketches” was an unusual book for the middle of the 19th century. Perhaps it could have been written nowhere except Russia, where there wasn't much in the way of a literary "tradition" circa 1850. At the same time that Dickens, Thackaray and their contemporaries in England were building on the foundations laid by the great 18th-century English novelists such as Richardson and Fielding, and writers in France like Hugo and Flaubert were doing the same with the traditions of Rousseau, Chateaubriand and Stendhal, Russian writers were still trying to create a tradition for themselves. Russian literature is often said to have begun with Pushkin and Gogol, both of whom flourished in the 1830s. Mikhail Lermontov's highly idiosyncratic novel “A Hero of Our Time” had appeared in 1840, when Pushkin had only been dead three years. Lermontov himself was killed in a duel, (the same fate that had befallen Pushkin) just a year after his novel came out. Russian authors of the 1840s and 50s may have had to contend with the tyranny of the czar's government, but they were working relatively free of the tyranny of a literary tradition.   Turgenev didn't bother writing "stories" in the accepted sense of the word when he wrote “A Sportsman's Sketches” (I'm using the title Hemingway knew; in more recent translations the book has been called “A Sportsman's Notebook.”) There is no conventional "plot" or schematic narrative anywhere to be seen. The stories are snapshots of places, characters, situations. Much of Hemingway's “In Our Time,” a product of "modernism" written not long after he had been reading Turgenev in Paris, works in much the same way. It was an uncommon technique for a writer of the mid-19th century to be using, to understate rather than overstate, use simple observation rather than rhetoric, and as often as not, to end on a "dying fall" rather than a crashing chord, as at the end of the sketch called "Raspberry Water:"   "Styopushka started up. The peasant sat down beside us. We fell silent again. On the other bank someone started singing, but such a melancholy song…My poor friend Vlas grew sadder and sadder. Half an hour later, we parted."   Now hear Hemingway at the end of "The Battler:"   "Nick climbed the embankment and started up the track. He found he had a ham sandwich in his hand and put it in his pocket. Looking back from the mounting grade before the track curved into the hills he could see the firelight in the clearing."   The dying fall, the laconic understatement. Two of Hemingway's trademarks. And yet as I re-read “A Sportsman's Sketches” a few years ago, I found example after example of the same sort of thing in Turgenev that later made Hemingway's reputation. Listen to this bit of dialogue from "Bezhin Meadow:"   "Well, Vanya," began Fedya tenderly, "is your sister Anyutka well?" "Very well," answered Vanya, slightly slurring the "r." "Tell her to come and see us. Why doesn't she come?" "I don't know." "Tell her to come." "I will." "Tell her that I'll give her a present." "And me too?" "Yes, you too."   Take out just one word, the adverb "tenderly," and that snatch of dialogue could be Hemingway. Or, perhaps it might be more appropriate to say, the following exchange from The Sun Also Rises could be Turgenev:   "What's the matter with the old one?" I asked. "He hasn't got any passport." I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me. "What will he do?" I asked. The guard spat in the dust. "Oh, he'll just wade across the stream." "Do you have much smuggling?" "Oh," he said, "they go through."   Yes, between Turgenev and Hemingway came Chekhov, another master of emotional tautness and the restrained phrase. And Hemingway greatly admired Chekhov too. But there can be little doubt that Turgenev's evocation, a generation before Chekhov, of the lovely, vast and brutal Russian countryside and its characters, in prose all the more effective for its restraint, gave Hemingway the cue for some of his own efforts, three-quarters of a century later, to evoke his own landscapes and characters, lovely and brutal, in prose all the more effective for its restraint.  III  Dubious Battles: Ernest Hemingway’s Journeys to War  In the movie “Patton,” George C. Scott, playing the role of the legendary-infamous World War II general, surveys a column of tanks advancing over rough terrain and says exultantly, "Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance!"   That statement might have been taken directly from the mouth of Ernest Hemingway. While it would be wrong to say that Hemingway approved of war as a thing-in-itself the way Patton seems to have, (and by the way, Hemingway spent part of World War II with one of Patton's armored divisions and thought little enough of the general to have one of his later fictional characters all but call Patton a pathological liar) the fact remains that violent death was one of Hemingway's lifelong fascinations, and if contemplating violent death is what you're after, war is as good as it gets.   Throughout Hemingway's life, timing was to be a key factor in what happened to him and in how he reacted. Hemingway's timing was always very good, whether with regard to external events or to his own endeavors first at becoming a writer and then at promulgating his career as one. With regard to timing, war was one of the areas in which history accomodated Hemingway-his lifetime spanned four major wars, three of which he saw close-up, though never as a soldier, and he often embroidered his war experiences for presentation to the home audience to make them look as "soldierly" as he possibly could. In his youth this would take the form of getting himself seriously wounded and then playing a form of "dress-up;" on a later occasion the play-acting almost got out of hand. But young or old, "playing soldier," whether in real-life or vicariously, through his fictional characters, was something Hemingway found nearly irresistible.   When he was young, it was part and parcel of his natural desire to be where the action was. Contemporaries who worked with the teenage Hemingway during his days as a cub reporter on the Kansas City Star reported that he would dash around the city compulsively, wanting always to know where the ambulance went, where the crime had occured, and to get there quickly.   His tenure at the Star was to be a short one for precisely this reason. He had graduated from high school in 1917 and, turning down the chance to go to college, proceeded directly into newspaper work after an uncle pulled some strings and helped him get the job in Kansas City.   But 1917 was also the year that America entered World War I. Hemingway, like many young American males at the time, heard the stories coming back from Europe and was determined to get into the war somehow. He would have liked to enlist as a soldier, but his father was opposed to that idea and in any case Hemingway's famously poor vision in his left eye probably would have gotten him a 4-F. But while working on the Star, he struck up a friendship with 22 year-old Ted Brumback, who just the previous summer had enlisted in the American Field Service and spent four months in France as an ambulance driver. Since it was unlikely that he would get into the war as a combatant, Hemingway decided to go this route, and after persuading his father to drop his objections, he, Brumback and another friend, Wilson Hicks, signed on with the Red Cross and by the following spring were on their way to the war. They ultimately served in northern Italy, not far from Milan.   The world knows the rest of this story. On the night of July 8, 1918, while he was passing out chocolate bars, cigarettes and magazines to Italian soldiers on the Piave River near Fossalta, Hemingway's dream of being where the action was came true in nightmarish fashion. The Austrians launched a mortar attack and Hemingway was badly wounded by shrapnel. His later recuperation in a Red Cross hospital would include a brief romance with a nurse several years his senior, Agnes von Kurowski. This romance, in turn, would result a decade later in his novel "A Farewell to Arms," and many decades later, in 1996, in the movie "In Love and War," although to the end of her life Kurowski kept denying that it ever happened.   Hemingway's natural flair for self-dramatization never had a better opportunity than this one. The relative gullibility of Americans on the home front during the First World War gave him a clear playing field for his love of pose. It was after all an era in which there was no CNN to bring the horrors of war right into everyone's living room. Even newsreels were in the future. The war was an ocean away, and the domestic attitude toward it was shaped by patriotic songs, jingoistic slogans and romantic stories of faraway Europe. Nineteen year-old Ernest Hemingway wasted no time in creating the image for the folks back home of himself as Warrior. He wrote extravagant letters claiming, among other things, that his wounds had been caused by machine-gun bullets as well as shrapnel. (This is still being argued.) He got himself all dolled up in a tailor-made uniform and had his picture taken wearing military insignia that he was not entitled to, and when he returned to Oak Park, Illinois the following winter, hobbling on a cane, his romantic tales of war were made more plausible by the soldier's cap and boots that he wore, not to mention the custom-made Italian cape.   Hemingway's next trip to war was a short one. In 1922 he was Paris correspondent for the Toronto Star and that newspaper sent him to Constantinople to cover the war between Greece and Turkey. He was there only for a few weeks, but the result was two striking pages of fiction, "On The Quai at Smyrna," the "opening note" in his first book of short stories, "In Our Time." He would not see war again for 14 years.   To outline the byzantine political and military machinations that brought about the Spanish Civil War (1936-38) would be beyond my purposes here, not to mention my space. Although this is a gross oversimplification, the war between those who supported the left-wing Popular Front in Spain and those who supported the right-wing National Front is often seen as having been a "dress rehearsal" for World War II, with Hitler backing one side and Stalin backing the other. Stalin's side lost the actual war, but won the propaganda war, not least because it was supported by a solid international phalanx of writers and intellectuals, not the least of whom was Ernest Hemingway.   In 1937-38, Hemingway went to Spain four times, the first three as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA.) By now an international celebrity with a hairy-chested image to maintain, he sent back reports from Madrid and from the countryside filled with details suggesting that he was constantly in danger from artillery bombardments as well as machine-gun and automatic rifle-fire. He was indeed in harm's way his share of times, and the evidence suggests that he always kept his composure in such situations. But as usual, his embroidering is never far away. He boasted that he was even in danger when he went to bed in his room at the Hotel Florida in Madrid, because as he explained to his readers, his room was on the front side of the building, facing the Nationalist guns two miles away. Here we find two of Hemingway's biographers offering different stories. In his groundbreaking 1969 biography, Carlos Baker tells us that Hemingway's roommate at the Hotel Florida was his old friend the American bullfighter Sidney Franklin. Franklin was indeed there, but Kenneth S. Lynn, in another biography published 17 years after Baker's, reveals that Hemingway's roommate at the Florida was actually his fellow journalist and soon-to-be third wife Martha Gellhorn, adding that he probably would not have been living there under those circumstances if it were as dangerous as he claimed.   Hemingway's involvement in the Spanish Civil War ended certain of his friendships, notably with fellow novelist John Dos Passos. Dos Passos was among those intellectuals who were initially sympathetic to the Loyalist cause, (another was George Orwell) but who, upon observing that the Communists and the anarchists were murdering people with no less alacrity than the fascists, became disillusioned with the cause (and in Dos Passos' case, with left-wing politics generally.) The politically-naive Hemingway, whose pride moreover dictated that he always seem to have more and better information than anyone else, refused to acknowledge the atrocities being commited on the Loyalist side and reported the war in a one-dimensional, one-sided manner. (Happy to the point of lionizing Hemingway at first, the political left would eventually turn against him when he recovered enough equanimity to write "For Whom the Bell Tolls," in which he not only maligned such loyalist icons as Andre Marty, commander of the International Brigades, but also, in the book's "massacre" chapter, committed the heresy of depicting fascists as victims.)   But if his first two major wars had served as canvases on which Hemingway drew sketches of what he wanted his own legend to look like, his third and last war was to be the biggest such, and this time he pulled out all the stops as promoter of his own image, to the point where he came very close to getting into serious trouble.   Shortly before D-Day in 1944, Hemingway arrived in London as a correspondent for Collier's magazine. He was to cover the invasion of Normandy, and he accompanied a number of armored and infantry battalions as they moved across France.   He was present on D-Day, was in fact aboard an LCVP landing craft as it advanced on Omaha Beach. Having dropped off its troops, the LCVP then returned to its ship with Hemingway still sitting astern. But what Hemingway subsequently wrote not only implied that he had gone ashore with the troops, but that he had played a vital role in helping to locate the beach. The Hemingway legend being what it was by then, few questioned his assertions.   And he was only warming up. Later came his claim to have entered Paris with the first troops, which led to the still-persisting myth that he personally liberated the Ritz Hotel. (Neither is true.)   And in fact this time Hemingway's military play-acting caught up with him. Other reporters resented his flamboyant showboating, which included travelling around to all appearances in command of a group of French Resistance irregulars and keeping firearms, bazookas, grenades and other ordnance in his Rambouillet hotel room. A complaint was filed that his activities were violating the Geneva Convention's rules regarding the conduct of news correspondents. In what must have been a particularly galling moment for him, Hemingway, at the risk of losing his reporter's credentials and being expelled from France, had to appear before a military panel and deny ever having taken part in any actual fighting himself. He offered deft excuses for some of the other things he was accused of, claiming for instance that weapons and ammunition had been kept in his hotel room only because storage space was in short supply.   But such was the Hemingway myth by 1944 that few concerned themselves with such niggling details. Hemingway had done such a good job for so many years as his own press agent, inflating his public persona to gargantuan proportions, that much of the world was prepared to accept his tall tales of war at face value. What few realized at the time was that Hemingway's real war, the one between his desire to go on living and his deep-seated desire not to, was even then being lost. Much of what passed for combat- zone bravery on Hemingway's part was in fact suicidal behavior, a point he would drive home at the end of a shotgun barrel 17 years later.  IV  The Death of Max Perkins and the Decline of Hemingway  On July 21, 1940, Ernest Hemingway turned 41 years old. He was just finishing “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” which was published to great acclaim a few months later. In fact by the time Max Perkins, who was both Hemingway's and Scott Fitzgerald's editor at Scribner's, had returned from Fitzgerald's funeral late that year, “For Whom the Bell Tolls” had already sold 189,000 copies. Three days after the book was published, a deal for nearly $150,000 was signed with Paramount for the film rights. The film was duly made in 1943, with Gary Cooper in the role of Robert Jordan and Ingrid Bergman, just a year off her appearance opposite Humphrey Bogart in “Casablanca,” as Maria.   In terms of his success as a writer, 1940 was in some ways the apotheosis of Ernest Hemingway. Critics and the reading public, who had been tracking and for the most part admiring his work since the publication of his first novel, “The Sun Also Rises,” in 1926, felt they had every reason to expect only further triumphs from the man who had become by then the most famous, and in the eyes of many, the greatest living American writer.   It didn't happen. In fact, in many ways and for a stew of reasons mixing everything from married life to geopolitics, the decade of the 1940s became Hemingway's version of the Lost Weekend. Though busy with a number of projects which included not only covering the war in Europe as a journalist, but also work on a massive, unfinished novel to be called “The Garden of Eden” (published in a heavily-edited edition in 1986) Hemingway produced no significant work of fiction between 1940 and 1950, and when he finally did, he might well have wished he hadn't.   As the decade began he was living in Cuba with his third wife, celebrated journalist Martha Gellhorn. However, not content to stay home in Cuba and be Mrs. Ernest Hemingway with a war raging in Europe, Gellhorn went off to cover the war as a correspondent for Colliers magazine, and Hemingway somewhat-reluctantly followed suit after a Huck Finn-like stint of hunting for German submarines in the Gulf Stream aboard his fishing boat, the "Pilar." Hemingway had been an ambulance driver in World War I and a news correspondent in the Spanish Civil War. World War II would be the third and last war he would witness (and once again, ironically, Hemingway, who was so fascinated with war and all of its trappings, would participate only as a non-combatant.)   Hemingway's marriage to Gellhorn became one of the war's casualties. By the spring of 1946 he was married to his fourth and final wife, journalist Mary Welsh.   With the war over, Hemingway went back to Cuba and resumed the life of writing, boozing and marlin-fishing that it had interrupted. Without a doubt he felt that he had earned the right to "kick back" and enjoy himself for while after working hard in Europe as a war correspondent, and certainly he returned to Cuba more famous than ever. That was part of the problem. From the late '40s onward, Hemingway and the media "worked" each other increasingly, and energies that he should have devoted to writing were devoted instead to "playing the role of Ernest Hemingway" for a cavalcade of reporters and photographers.   Two separate, highly significant and not necessarily unrelated catastrophes struck Hemingway in the years immediately following World War II. The first was the death in 1947 of his beloved and trusted editor Max Perkins. The second, three years later, was the publication of his first full-length novel since “For Whom The Bell Tolls,” the much-panned “Across The River And Into The Trees.” Shortly after the publication of "Across The River" in 1950, E.B. White, in the New Yorker magazine, published a satire of it called "Across The Street and into the Grill." I don't know how funny I would find it now, but when I read it at age 19 I nearly suffocated with laughter. (When told of White's satire, Hemingway growled that the next step up from writing parodies was scribbling on latrine walls, conveniently forgetting that one of his own early efforts, "The Torrents Of Spring," had been a savage parody of Hemingway's mentor, Sherwood Anderson.)   Max Perkins had been Hemingway's editor since 1929, when he had worked with Hemingway on A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway's father had committed suicide not long before Hemingway first met Perkins, and from the earliest days of their association, Perkins took on something of a fatherly role with Hemingway, much the same role he assumed about the same time for an ungainly young man from North Carolina named Thomas Wolfe, who had recently dumped an avalanche of manuscript on Perkins' desk which Perkins would eventually hew and carve into “Look Homeward, Angel.”   Over the nearly 20 years of their association, Perkins acquired the reputation of being the editor at Scribner's best qualified to handle the man who was well known as the touchiest author in the firm's stable. Perkins knew how to deal diplomatically with the vain, moody and mercurial Hemingway, could guage when it was "safe" to offer him honest criticisms of his work and when it was a better idea to soft-pedal. It was with Perkins' editorial "ruddering" that Hemingway brought out all of his fiction from “A Farewell to Arms" to “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” a decade which also included Death in the Afternoon, “Green Hills of Africa,” “To Have and Have Not,” the short-story collections “Men Without Women” and “Winner Take Nothing” and a play about the Spanish Civil War, “The Fifth Column.”   The 1930s had been a busy and productive time for both men. But when Perkins died, Hemingway had not published a novel in seven years.   For many who pursue it, writing is very much like playing a musical instrument. You have to stay in practice or you get rusty. Hemingway loved to apply sports metaphors to writing--his remarks about having "outboxed" de Maupassant, Stendhal and Turgenev have been repeated ad nauseam-and indeed he seemed to have been one of those writers who needs to stay "in training" to keep his writing sharp, not surprising perhaps in view of the heavy emphasis Hemingway's writing always did put on pure sensory experience--seeing, smelling, tasting, touching and hearing. (Although he drank a lot throughout his life, Hemingway never smoked again after his early twenties-he didn't like the way it dulled his sense of smell.)   With all of this in mind, Perkins' death couldn't have come at a worse time for Hemingway. He was physically out of shape, overweight and soaked in liquor, (though he did often cut back on his drinking for one reason or another) and his body, including his head, was battered and tired from a long history of injuries and accidents. Journalism had taken up a lot of his time during the war years, and despite continued work on such projects as the ultimately-tabled “The Garden of Eden,” Hemingway hadn't publicly strutted his fictional talents in a long time.   It was in this atmosphere that Hemingway decided to make his "comeback." Perkins was gone, and between being both out-of-shape and increasingly worried that after all these years he might not be able to perform like he used to, (and hence, disappoint a world that, even without People magazine or eight-second sound bites, had turned him into a superstar) Hemingway was in no condition to be his own best editor.   And so, in 1949-50, Hemingway labored away on his new tale, set in Venice, through a haze of booze shot through with the piercing stage lights of global adulation. Caught up in the work, he managed to persuade himself that he was writing a masterpiece, his best book yet. And there was no Max Perkins around any more to gently rein him in and persuade him to cut here, condense there.   The result was an unqualified disaster, and what underlay the book's plot had much to do with it. A hopeless romantic despite his tough-guy posturing, Hemingway throughout his life was constantly falling in and out of love with one woman after another. He married four of them, but there were plenty of other "infatuations" along the way, and the older he got, the younger the infatuations got.   In the late 1940s, the overweight, booze-bloated, celebrity-inflated Hemingway, pushing 50, began mooning over a beautiful young Italian woman, Adriana Ivancich. Hemingway's romantic stories often had their foundations in his own fantasising, and the character Renata in “Across the River and Into the Trees” is based on Ivancich; Renata's doomed love affair in Venice with a dying American army colonel, Richard Cantwell, plays out Hemingway's fantasy about himself and Adriana in much the same way that, 20 years earlier, the fate of Frederic Henry and Catherine Barkley in "A Farewell to Arms" had played out his wishful embroidering upon his disappointing relationship with 26 year-old hospital nurse Agnes von Kurowski.    It is not my purpose here to write a review of a book that was published more than 50 years ago, but let me just mention the point at which “Across the River and Into the Trees” starts to "go wrong" for me.   The book starts out well enough. The duck-shooting scene in Ch. 1 has all of the old Hemingway magic. You hear that ice crack. You see those boats moving in the canal. Cantwell is thirsty; you're thirsty.   It's at the beginning of Ch. 2 that I detect the first warning signs of Ernest Miller Hemingway fading into the wings and the huffing and puffing "Papa" taking center stage. Twice on the same page he refers to Cantwell not as an "army colonel" or a "colonel in the army" as anyone else might, but as a "Colonel of Infantry in the Army of the United States." This is affectation, and the older Hemingway got, the more he swam in it. And from that point in the book, things just get windily worse.   In his controversial 1986 "psychobiography" of Hemingway, Kenneth Lynn raised the enticing question (buttressed by like-minded speculation from Canadian critic Northrop Frye) that had Perkins not died when he did, he might have tried to talk Hemingway into distilling this material into a short story. Frye pointed out, and Lynn agrees, that there is much good in the story, and had Hemingway boiled it down to say, 100 pages, it might have been his version of “Death in Venice,” with all the lyricism and dark power of Thomas Mann's 1911 mini-masterpiece.   One can speculate forever on such "fantasy baseball" issues, but the fact is that Hemingway's self-critical judgment had not deserted him entirely despite his catastrophic "bad call" on “Across the River.” Had Perkins still been around, it might indeed have been a better book. Surely Hemingway's ability to cut, compress and keep it short, always one of his strengths, was still there. Having been knocked to the mat (to use a metaphor he would have liked) by the critics over “Across the River,” he got back to his feet and two years later issued the short work that would clinch the Nobel Prize for him. Despite what you might think of “The Old Man and the Sea,” (and I have little use for its gooey sentimentality myself) it showed that Hemingway could still control his material if he wanted to. He would lose that ability within a few years as his physical and mental problems mounted. But it is tantalizing to wonder about what the quality of the work of Hemingway's final years might have looked like had not his good friend and most trusted editor died when Hemingway, to judge from what he subsequently produced, was just about to need him the most.    V  Papa’s “Good Eats Café:” Hemingway and Food   One of the first things you realize when you read Hemingway, and this was in fact one of the boldest brushstrokes in the portrait of himself which he presented to the world, is that the man loved to eat and drink. His Rabelaisian appetite for life included, (and quite logically so) a concomitant appetite for the pleasures of the table (not to mention the bar.)   In fact, it has occurred to me more than once that had Hemingway not taken up the writing of fiction as his life's work, he might have had a brilliant career as a restaurant critic for the slicker magazines, a sort of foul-mouthed Duncan Hines.   I've mentioned in other places the fact that the self-educated Hemingway liked to boast about the breadth of his reading and his knowledge of books; one of Hemingway's best-known affectations was in fact his claim to have "the inside dope" on just about everything, and that went for food and wine as well as books, baseball, boxing, battles, bullfighters and trout-fishing streams.   Yes, Hemingway loved to eat and drink. And of all the claims he made about himself which, over the years, various people have questioned, none succumbs to the pin-prick of evidence more quickly than his claim, late in life, that he and his first wife were going romantically hungry in Paris during the 1920s. True, they were living simply and economizing so that they could afford to go on ski trips and such, but starving? I don't want to be catty about this, but take a look at a photograph of Hemingway taken on his wedding day in 1921, and then glance at a photo of him taken in 1924 in the courtyard of 113 rue Notre Dame des Champs in Paris, where he and his wife Hadley were living at the time. After less than three years in Paris, the slender bridegroom of 1921 is already getting a bit jowly, and that suit he's wearing looks tight on him. If "hunger was good discipline," as he boasted in his late-life memoir “A Moveable Feast,” Hemingway was getting his discipline somewhere else. I won't stoop so low as to point out the irony in the book's title. (In fairness to Hemingway, I've been to Paris, and you can't not eat there. Those travel brochures which tout Paris as the world's capital of good food are only stating an objective fact: it is that.)   I confess that I once ate something pretty disgusting, if not exactly on Hemingway's recommendation, then at least because he made it sound so good. No, it wasn't a thousand-legger, but in the terms that any gourmet would understand, it might as well have been.  I was 18 and had already been under Hemingway's spell for a couple of years. One fine Saturday afternoon I was re-reading one of my favorites among his early stories, “Big Two Hearted River, Part I.” I read through the following passage. (See if this doesn't make you hungry too, even though we're clearly not talking here about anything you'd be served at Michaud's in Paris):   “Nick was hungry. He did not believe he had ever been hungrier. He opened and emptied a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti into the frying pan. "I've got a right to eat this kind of stuff, if I'm willing to carry it," Nick said. His voice sounded strange in the darkening woods. He did not speak again.”   Then a little further on:   “The beans and spaghetti warmed. Nick stirred them and mixed them together. They began to bubble, making little bubbles that rose with difficulty to the surface. There was a good smell. Nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread. The little bubbles were coming faster now. Nick sat down beside the fire and lifted the frying pan off. He poured about half the contents out into the tin plate. It spread slowly on the plate. Nick knew it was too hot. He poured on some tomato catchup…He ate the whole plateful before he remembered the bread. Nick finished the second plateful with the bread, mopping the plate shiny…While he waited for the coffee to boil, he opened a can of apricots. He liked to open cans. He emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup. While he watched the coffee on the fire, he drank the juice syrup of the apricots…”   By now, depending on the sophistication of your palette, you're probably either salivating or getting queasy.   But after reading this vivid passage, I just had to find out what this mess actually tasted like. I walked over to Safeway and bought a can of Chef Boy-Ar-Dee spaghetti, a can of Van Camp's pork and beans, and a can of Del Monte apricots. Then, grossing my mother right out of the kitchen, I cooked it all up, sliced some bread and dumped catchup over it, just like in the story.   You know, it actually wasn't bad, and sipping apricot juice right out of the can while the coffee was perking was also kind of pleasant.   Give me a break. I was 18.   Hemingway wrote "Big Two-Hearted River" in 1923, when he was on the verge of his first triumphs. And although his powers waned with the passing years, the victims of too many injuries and too much booze, not to mention too much fame and adoration, more than 30 years later he had lost none of his touch for making his readers hungry. Check out this mouth-watering passage from “A Moveable Feast” in which Hemingway walks into Lipp's, a bistro on the left bank in Paris, and orders himself a fine lunch:  “…I sat down on the bench against the wall with the mirror in back and a table in front and the waiter asked if I wanted beer and I asked for a distingue, the big glass mug that held a liter, and for potato salad.   The beer was very cold and wonderful to drink. The pommes a l'huile were firm and marinated and the olive oil delicious. I ground black pepper over the potatoes and moistened the bread in the olive oil. After the first heavy draft of beer I ate and drank very slowly. When the pommes a l'huile were gone I ordered another serving and a cervelas. This was a sausage like a heavy, wide frankfurter split in two and covered with a special mustard sauce.  I mopped up all the oil and all of the sauce with bread and drank the beer slowly until it began to lose its coldness and then I finished it and ordered a demi and watched it drawn. It seemed colder than the distingue and I drank half of it.”   Are you hungry yet? I had to go to the kitchen while I was typing that out and get myself a snack. And by the way, Lipp's, like Pamplona, is one of those places that Hemingway "put on the map." Some years ago I was in Paris and thought I'd drop in at Lipp's to sample some hemingwayesque ambience. No way--the place was wall-to-wall tourists, all doing exactly what I was doing. I ended up having my lunch at a tiny Greek grill (not there in Hemingway's time, I'm sure) on a tiny side-street across from the Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame.   Or try this meal, from an earlier sketch in the same collection:   “I asked the waiter for a dozen Portugaises and a half-carafe of the dry white wine they had there…As I ate the oysters with their strong taste of the sea and their faint metallic taste that the cold white wine washed away, leaving only the sea taste and the succulent texture, and as I drank their cold liquid from each shell and washed it down with the crisp taste of the wine, I...began to be happy and to make plans.”   Yes, after a meal like that, I probably would too.   As the short-story example cited above makes clear, Hemingway didn't confine his culinary passages to memoirs. I always loved this little scene from “The Sun Also Rises” in which his two male characters, who have left a couple of bottles of wine in an ice-cold stream to chill while they go off trout-fishing, sit down to enjoy their picnic lunch and, using the news of the recent death of William Jennings Bryan as the springboard for a bit of typical snappy jazz-age repartee, indulge in a little creative playing-with-their-food:   “The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty. "That's not such a filthy wine," Bill said. "The cold helps it," I said. We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch. "Chicken." "There's hard-boiled eggs." "Find any salt?" "First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that." "He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday." "No. Not really?" "Yes. Bryan's dead." Bill laid down the egg he was peeling. "Gentlemen," he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper, "I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken, then the egg." "Wonder what day God created the chicken?" "Oh," said Bill, sucking the drumstick, "how should we know?"   In the much-criticized “Across the River and Into the Trees” (1950) Hemingway seems to spend half of what's purportedly a tragic love story going on and on about what his characters are sipping or digging into:   "Two very dry martinis," the colonel said. "Montgomerys. Fifteen to one."…"The Martinis were icy cold and true Montgomerys, and after touching the edges, they felt them glow happily all through their upper bodies." …  "Just then the lobster was served.   It was tender, with the peculiar slippery grace of that kicking muscle which is the tail, and the claws were excellent, neither too thin nor too fat. "A lobster fills with the moon," the colonel told the girl. "When the moon is dark he is not worth eating."   By the way, calling the martinis "Montgomerys" was Hemingway's idea of a joke: it was often said of the British WWII general Montgomery that he would not launch an attack unless he had at least a 15 to 1 advantage over the enemy. Hence: martinis made with a recipe of 15 parts gin to one part vermouth were "Montgomerys." This kind of heavy-handed, not very funny humor was typical of Hemingway.  It's been speculated that if Hemingway's editor Max Perkins had still been alive when Hemingway wrote this novel, he might have tried to persuade the touchy Hemingway to cut it down to novella-length. It would have been easy to do, actually-cut out all the talk about eating and drinking and "Across the River" would have been a novella by default.   In truth, Hemingway was anything but a gourmet. To the chagrin of anyone who had to live with him, in fact, one of his favorite taste-treats was raw onion sandwiches with plenty of ketchup. And although he boasted throughout his life of his supposedly great knowledge of wines, true wine connoisseurs who either knew him or have read his works assure us all that much of it was pose. No, Hemingway's value to us as a "food writer" does not lie in any claim he can make to directing his readers toward the most exquisite and the best-prepared. Rather, it lies where the rest of his value lies, in an art so deeply involved in the world of sense-experience, an art in which the five sensory organs are virtually instruments of thought and expression, that we share in that world, which Hemingway made to come alive at his fingertips. Just as Hemingway's chiseled prose brings us to breathe the air his characters breathe and feel their emotions at a remove, so that same prose makes us taste the meals they eat and savor the wines they sip in a world as three-dimensional as good writing can make it. Hemingway wrote well about everything he loved, and he loved a good meal. We're all a little richer (and maybe a little fatter) for his having done so.   VI  Scott and Ernest: A Logical Friendship  The most famous friendship in American literature is also, beyond almost any doubt, the most exasperating to write about.   Matthew J. Bruccoli, author and editor of a number of works on F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) bravely set out a few years ago to write a book about the relationship between Fitzgerald and his younger contemporary Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). Bruccoli's 1994 book “Fitzgerald and Hemingway, A Dangerous Friendship” opens on a note that will set the tone for the rest of it: Bruccoli cites Hemingway's famous account in “A Moveable Feast” of the first time he met Fitzgerald, a meeting that according to Hemingway took place at the Dingo bar in Paris in 1925, and at which Duncan Chaplin, who had pitched for Princeton's baseball team when Fitzgerald was a student there, was present.   Then Bruccoli goes on to write that Chaplin was not, in fact, at the Dingo bar that day. In fact Chaplin was not in Paris in 1925. In fact Chaplin was not in Europe in 1925. In fact, Chaplin never met Hemingway. In fact, as Bruccoli proceeds to show his readers, most anecdotes about Fitzgerald and Hemingway, and there are dozens of them, tend to evaporate under the light of investigation. Like a mariner hugging the shore, Bruccoli tries as best as he can to stick to the provable. As a result, the text of Fitzgerald and Hemingway consists largely of letters written by the two authors to or about one another.   After slugging it out with the evidence for 196 pages, Bruccoli comes very close to throwing up his hands in despair. On p. 197, writing of Hemingway's appearance in Hollywood in 1937, when Fitzgerald was there doing film work and Hemingway was in town to show and discuss “The Spanish Earth,” a propaganda film about the Spanish Civil War which he had worked on, Bruccoli writes:   "A researcher working on Fitzgerald and Hemingway is forced to conclude that there may not be such a thing as a reliable eyewitness for events involving them."  It should come as no surprise. Whatever else they were, Fitzgerald and Hemingway were legends, each in his own way. And legends have a curious effect on facts, somewhat analogous perhaps to the way in which physicists tell us that light itself begins to bend near a black hole in space. To put it less esoterically, both men were celebrities. Celebrities generate "buzz," and "buzz" is famously unreliable. Also, despite the obvious differences between the two, they were in some ways astonishingly alike, as we shall see. One of those ways is that they both ultimately self-destructed, although at different speeds. “A Moveable Feast,” famous for its chapters on Fitzgerald, was written well into Hemingway's own journey down, and those chapters cannot be taken at face value as an appraisal of Fitzgerald's character or his fate, although they do contain much truth.  Fitzgerald and Hemingway did indeed meet in Paris in 1925. At the time of their first meeting, Fitzgerald, the older of the two by three years, was an established novelist. He had already published the flawed but highly popular “This Side Of Paradise” (1920) and the also-uneven but acclaimed “The Beautiful And Damned” (1922). His third novel and first acknowledged masterpiece, “The Great Gatsby,” was published the year the two met. Hemingway, at the time of their first meeting, was almost unknown outside the literary "little mags" of Paris-his first American book, the short story collection “In Our Time” (not to be confused with its earlier, Parisian incarnation, “in our time”) was published in October of that year by the firm of Boni and Liveright in an edition of slightly more than 1,300 copies.   But meeting Fitzgerald was just another example of the flawless timing that characterized the young Hemingway's career. Meeting Sherwood Anderson in Chicago in 1921 had resulted in his being given letters of introduction to Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound in Paris; now, Fitzgerald, having met Hemingway, was deeply impressed with his talent and wrote to his own editor, Max Perkins, suggesting that Hemingway would be a good "catch" for Scribner's, Fitzgerald's own publisher and a much bigger, higher-profile company than Boni and Liveright. If Fitzgerald didn't exactly "launch" Hemingway, at the very least he gave him a big boost. The following year Scribner's published Hemingway's first novel, “The Sun Also Rises,” and he was on his way to world fame.   The relationship between the two authors was an odd one. Although the older of the two, and the more successful as a novelist when they first met, (this was about to change) Fitzgerald accepted something of a "younger brother" role in his relationship with the more robust and overbearing Hemingway. The reasons lay in the two men's similar backgrounds and very different characters. Both came from the midwest; Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota and Hemingway in the suburbs of Chicago. Each had a weak father and a strong mother. Scott had two older sisters who died while his mother was pregnant with him. Later another son was born, but lived only an hour. Hemingway grew up in a house full of sisters and throughout his childhood and youth longed for a little brother. But when his brother Leicester finally did come along, Hemingway was well into his teens and it was too late for the big-brother-little-brother relationship he had longed for. Fitzgerald grew up craving heroes just as strongly as Hemingway longed to be one. At Princeton, for example, from which he did not graduate, Fitzgerald idolized the burly, bloodied-up football players whom he couldn't match in gridiron prowess. Hemingway positively relished being burly and bloodied-up in a whole series of roles that he played during his lifetime, and he basked in attention. In this respect they were a perfect match: Fitzgerald needed a hero, and Hemingway fit the bill.   A key element that helped determine the shape of Hemingway and Fitzgerald's friendship was the striking divergence in their respective writing careers, which in turn were shaped largely by the circumstances of their personal lives. Fitzgerald actually made very little money during his lifetime from his novels. On the other hand, he made enormous amounts of money, until the early 1930s when this source of money dried up for him, by writing short stories, chiefly for The Saturday Evening Post. He needed the money badly. In 1920 Fitzgerald had married the glamorous but unstable Zelda Sayre, and the two of them became living symbols of that age of extravagance. In Europe and in the United States they lived lavishly, and Fitzgerald, who wanted to write novels, found himself forced by his and Zelda's spendthrift lifestyle to write the more lucrative short stories, many of them second and third rate, even in his own eyes. (In fact, the more second-and-third rate they were, the easier they sold and the better they paid, to Fitzgerald's own disgust. His finest stories, such as “Babylon Revisited” and “The Diamond As Big As The Ritz” either paid less well or were in some cases rejected altogether.)   Ironically, Fitzgerald's career as a novelist ran into a brick wall in the very year he met Hemingway. For whatever reasons, (Hemingway's theory was that critical praise of “The Great Gatsby” paralyzed Fitzgerald into being terrified that he might not be able to equal that performance) Fitzgerald would not manage to finish another novel until “Tender Is The Night” some nine years later, and it was both a critical and a commercial failure. Fitzgerald's life after 1925 was a three-way struggle: he struggled with alcoholism, with his increasingly out-of-control wife (Zelda would be repeatedly hospitalized for mental illness during the 1930s) and with his attempts to get on with a novel while at the same time being forced to churn out magazine fiction to pay his bills. Later, during the Depression, with the magazine-fiction market no longer there for him, he would make a couple of disastrous sojourns to Hollywood to write film scripts that were never filmed, trying to make enough money to stay alive, to pay Zelda's hospital bills and to put his daughter Scottie through school.   Hemingway's story couldn't have made a sharper contrast. Just as Fitzgerald's writing career was flaming out, Hemingway's was about to burst into full morning splendor. After "The Sun Also Rises" was published in 1926, Hemingway divorced his first wife, Hadley Richardson, and married his second, the wealthy Arkansas socialite Pauline Pfeiffer.  “A Farewell To Arms,” written mostly in Key West, Florida, where he and Pauline had been given a house by her rich uncle Gus back in Arkansas, cemented both Hemingway's reputation and his fame.   Freed from the constraints of having to write for a living both by the success of his first novel and by his second wife's wealth, Hemingway could and did look down upon Fitzgerald's magazine-writing. Later, during the '30s, Hemingway would also be able to avoid Hollywood and the necessity to try and make money by writing for the movies, a fate not even spared William Faulkner, who among other things worked on the film version of Hemingway's “To Have And Have Not.” (Hollywood being Hollywood, the end result had little to do with “To Have And Have Not.”) 1940, the year in which Fitzgerald died, was the year in which Hemingway's career peaked with the publication of “For Whom The Bell Tolls.” Clearly, theirs was the friendship of a writer on his way up and a writer spectacularly on his way down.  But Fitzgerald made an ironic "comeback" in the years after his death, and largely for that reason Hemingway's treatment of Fitzgerald in “A Moveable Feast” is a highly-suspect farrago of half-truths, exaggerations and memories skewed by alcohol. One of Hemingway's biographers has even suggested that the whining, impotent, drunken hypochondriac depicted by Hemingway in his memoir was a deliberate attempt to cut his rival "down to size" after Edmund Wilson and numerous other critics had re-appraised Fitzgerald's work following his death and found it on the whole much better than many had previously thought. But although the distortions and mis-rememberings are there, Hemingway was far from alone in finding Fitzgerald a trial to be around. Charming and witty when sober, Fitzgerald became boorish, rude, loud and maudlin when drunk, and frequently humiliated himself in public. One of American literature's most famous drunks, Fitzgerald actually had a very low tolerance for alcohol. His inability to "hold his liquor" diminished him in Hemingway's eyes because it was a failure of one of Hemingway's key tests of manliness. Other friends of both writers, notably the wealthy Gerald and Sara Murphy, who frequented many of the same European locales, also found themselves exasperated by Fitzgerald's outrageous behavior when drunk. Hemingway even claimed that he had been kicked out of one of his Paris apartments owing to a raucous late-night visit by a drunken Fitzgerald, and for a time gave instructions that Fitzgerald was not to be given his Paris address, he would meet him only in a cafe or some other neutral place. After a particularly disastrous weekend at Fitzgerald's house near Wilmington, Delaware in 1928, Hemingway said he felt that bullfights were sedatives compared to weekends with Fitzgerald.   For all of this, and for the fact that Hemingway and Zelda Fitzgerald loathed each other, (Zelda called Hemingway "as bogus as a rubber check" and Hemingway accused Zelda of encouraging Scott's drinking because she was jealous of his writing) the affection between the two men was strong if their relationship was at times a rocky one. They kept up a regular correspondence, for the most part very friendly in tone, and Fitzgerald, a keen critic and, as John Dos Passos once observed, a thorough professional when it came to writing despite his shortcomings, contributed some critical observations that helped shape Hemingway's conclusion of “A Farewell To Arms.”   Later, things between the two weren't so rosy, as when Fitzgerald published his famous series of essays about his own failure and how it came about, published later in book form as "The Crack-Up." Hemingway was horrified by such a public de profundis; his own credo was that one should do the manly thing, deal with one's problems in private and not parade them around for public view. Subsequently he made a cruel direct reference in "Snows of Kilimanjaro" to Fitzgerald's supposed "romantic awe for the rich" and how it was one of the things that "wrecked" him. Deeply stung, Fitzgerald complained about this, both to Hemingway directly and to their mutual editor Max Perkins. In later editions of the story Fitzgerald's name is changed to "Julian." Actually, though, as biographer of both Hemingway and Fitzgerald Jeffrey Meyers pointed out, Snows of Kilimanjaro isn't so very much different in theme from “The Crack-Up.” Both are about failed writers confronting their respective failures, one in a fictionalized context, the other in something more like what you might see nowadays on a daytime cable television talk show. Fitzgerald was also hurt when he finally did publish “Tender Is The Night” in 1934 and Hemingway's comments-which Fitzgerald had begged for-were generally negative. A few years later, however, Hemingway read the book again, saw its merits and changed his opinion.   When reading about Fitzgerald and Hemingway, one is tempted to think of Shem and Shaun, the two archetypal brothers in Joyce's “Finnegans Wake.” In Shem we have the man of contemplation and in Shaun the man of action, and the relationship is a destructive one. Fitzgerald in fact made a kind of "Shaun" character out of Hemingway in a lamentable series of stories about "Phillipe, the Count of Darkness," in which he attempted to envision Hemingway as an armor-wearing, horseback-riding character out of the Middle Ages. But the contrast is really an illusion. The chief difference between them was that Hemingway had a much better sense of public relations; he saw to it that, as the public perceived it anyway, everything he did was related to his work. Fitzgerald, on the other hand, became identified in the public eye with dissipation and failure. But Hemingway, too, had his weaknesses, and Fitzgerald didn't fail to notice them. For example there was Fitzgerald's prediction about the women in Hemingway's life. Fitzgerald remarked early on that Hemingway would "need a new wife for each book," and whether such were the case or not, it was true that Hemingway tended to solve marital problems by running away from them: he was married four times. (Despite Zelda's mental illness and several affairs of his own, Fitzgerald remained married to her right down to the end.) Also, Fitzgerald noticed that Hemingway, just like himself, had a psychological vulnerability. "He's quite as nervously broken down as I am," Fitzgerald wrote, "but it manifests itself in different ways. His inclination is toward megalomania and mine toward melancholy." True, when Fitzgerald said it. But in December, 1940, when Fitzgerald died nearly-forgotten and Hemingway was at the pinnacle of world fame, neither of them could have known that Hemingway was on a track--albeit a slower one--to an ending not so much different from Fitzgerald's. True, Hemingway never had to watch himself sinking into obscurity the way Fitzgerald did. In 1937, when Fitzgerald came to Hollywood to write for the movies, he found that many people there thought he was already dead. But Hemingway's final years were haunted by some of the same ghosts that haunted Fitzgerald: alcoholism, mental illness (in this case his own) and a creeping sense of diminished self-worth, a growing suspicion that maybe he wasn't any good anymore.   Hemingway prefaced his chapters on Fitzgerald in A Moveable Feast with these words:   "His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and their construction and he learned to think and could not fly anymore because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless."   Hemingway wrote this passage around 1957, and he might well have been talking about himself.   VII  On The Altar Of The Goddess: Ernest Hemingway and the Cult of the 'Celebrity Artist'  In 1970, when Ernest Hemingway had been in his grave for nine years, Norman Mailer published “Of A Fire On The Moon,” a long series of baroque ruminations centering upon the July, 1969 mission of Apollo 11, the space flight in which men set foot for the first time on the moon.   What does this have to do with Hemingway, who had committed suicide just a few months after Yuri Gagarin and Alan Shepard had become the first men to venture into space?   Well, Mailer thought Hemingway germane enough to the discussion of moon missions to open his book with the following sentence: "Norman, born sign of Aquarius, had been in Mexico when the news came about Hemingway." The chapter that begins with this sentence bears an epigram from one of Hemingway's ghastly poems: "Now he sleeps with that old whore death...Do thee take this old whore death for thy lawful wedded wife?" And Mailer proceeds to explain why he chose to open a discussion of one of technology's most spectacular triumphs with a reminiscence about Hemingway's death: "Now the greatest living romantic was dead. Dread was loose. The giant had not paid his dues, and something awful was in the air. Technology would fill the pause. Into the silences static would enter..."   You would have to go back to Tolstoy to find a writer who towered over his age the way Hemingway towered over his. But Hemingway's stature was of a different nature than Tolstoy's, necessarily, because it was a phenomenon that took place in a wholly different context-an American one. In the Russian tradition, writers whose celebrity grows to a certain degree tend to take on the mantle of the sage. Certainly Tolstoy did this, and more recently, Solzhenitsyn has tried to. But America is not a country that generally takes to sages. America takes to successes. Become successful enough at something in America and you might become a celebrity, especially if there are large sums of money involved.   Before the invention of cinema, American celebrities tended to be statesmen, captains of industry or characters who had distinguished themselves in some way directly connected with public life-Jane Addams setting up Hull House, Carrie Nation and her crusade against the saloons. The late 19th century in America did have its literary celebrities, but they tended to be imports, like Oscar Wilde, or exports, like Henry James. “Huckleberry Finn” aside, (a book that Hemingway loved, by the way) Mark Twain's fame rested chiefly on his being a funny guy-—Twain was doing stand-up a hundred years before anyone had heard of Jerry Seinfeld.   But the rise of the movie industry and its consolidation in Hollywood during the years after World War I created a new breed of celebrity in America. Celebrity was no longer chiefly the province of the mighty and the wealthy-they had to move over now and make room for the beautiful and the glamorous.   I have noted elsewhere in discussing Hemingway that one of the most remarkable things about his remarkable life was his timing. It was as flawless as that of the best vaudeville comedian. Hemingway always somehow managed to be right where he had to be. For example he was in Chicago in 1921 at just the right time to meet Sherwood Anderson, who dissuaded him from his plans to return to Italy, where he had served as an ambulance driver in World War I, and talked him instead, as an aspiring young writer, into going to Paris, where the author of “Winesburg, Ohio” used his influence to get Hemingway introduced to both Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound. It's not often that an aspiring writer gets a string of "good breaks" like that, but for Hemingway this was a "natural."   And so it could be observed (and argued endlessly whether this was a good thing for Hemingway or a bad one) that his career as a writer was "taking off" at the very moment when America was in the midst of the last long party it would enjoy until the economic boom of the post-Reagan era: the fabled "Jazz age," as Hemingway's on-again, off-again friend Scott Fitzgerald named it, that dizzy decade the 1920s. As the twenties progressed, Hollywood was remaking and redefining Americans' very notion of celebrity in an endless cavalcade of the glamorous and the more glamorous: Rudolf Valentino, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Clara Bow, Charlie Chaplin...the list goes on and on.   Between the two of them, Hemingway and Fitzgerald did much to capture the tone and spirit of that era. “The Great Gatsby” could be part of a social study of the 1920s, and so could “The Sun Also Rises.” In fact I would recommend that any historian or sociologist preparing to write about that decade in America be sure and read these two novels.   But Hemingway managed to transcend the era in a way that Fitzgerald didn't. Fitzgerald became identified in the public mind with the age that he had given a name to, and when it was over, Fitzgerald's career faded with the memory of it and his reputation would not revive until his works underwent a critical re-evaluation following his death in 1940.   Perhaps one of the reasons why Hemingway transcended the age in a way Fitzgerald would not be perceived as having done until after he was dead is because, while Fitzgerald obviously mirrored the era in his writings, Hemingway mirrored an attitude toward it which made a lasting impression on America. He created a persona, the "Hemingway hero," that tight-lipped, tough-talking stoic guy who struck such a resounding chord with the generation of males that was coming of age between the two world wars. Young men in America now had a choice: they could ape their favorite Hollywood movie star, or they could imitate a Hemingway character. Many did--the wisecracking dialogue of "The Sun Also Rises" became a generation's way of talking to itself, and the romantic tragedy of "A Farewell to Arms" reflected that same generation's more sentimental side. (Small wonder that the 1932 movie version starring Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper was such a hit.)  Add to this what his public knew about Hemingway the man--the sojourns in Europe, the marlin fishing in the Florida keys, the bullfights in Spain, and, following his first safari in 1934, the big-game hunting in Africa...is it any wonder that in this age of "stars," Hemingway managed to become one?   He was in fact the first literary "star" in 20th century America. Hemingway was the first writer (discounting Fitzgerald, who "burned out") to carve out a place for himself in the gossip columns and the glossy magazines. There would be many creative artists after him--Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, and Norman Mailer himself come to mind--who would achieve the kind of celebrity that today we associate with People magazine, but it really did start with Hemingway, and the phenomenon has much to say about Hemingway's fate, both in the way his life turned out and in the way he came to dominate his age such that Mailer wanted to "tip his hat" to the great man before proceeding to talk about a voyage to the moon.   The difference between a major artist and a minor one is that a major artist "develops." Judged by that standard, Yeats would be considered a major artist because his late poetry is nothing like his early work. A.E. Housman, on the other hand, would have to be adjudged a "minor artist" according to that standard, because once he had down the "voice" he wanted to use, he stuck with it and never went any further. Quite often, part and parcel of that process of development is "the reinvention of the self." Yeats famously played with different masks. Closer to our own time, Bob Dylan--often to his audience's chagrin--has chosen to "reinvent" himself several times.  Hemingway went through discernable stages in his life as man and artist. Some time around the mid-1970's I watched a television drama called “The Hemingway Play,” in which four characters representing Hemingway at difference stages of his life met and interacted with each other. The outcome, as you might imagine, was violent, poignant and pitiful.   The fact is, "reinventing" yourself can be a two-edged sword. In Hemingway's case, the reinventing took the form, whether intentionally or not, of creating a “Doppelgaenger” version of himself, one which subsumed the "real" Ernest Hemingway as his ever upward-ratcheting celebrity kept raising the stakes on him. Hemingway repeatedly insisted that his fictions were fictions, and that they shouldn't be construed as anything other than that. But increasingly as time went on, particularly after World War II, when Hemingway's service as a war correspondent for Collier's magazine had given him the opportunity to inflate his legend to ever-more gargantuan proportions against the backdrop of that conflict, Hemingway and the media played each other like a couple of violins. Had he been content to remain simply a writer-or perhaps "allowed" would be a more charitable word-things might have turned out differently, both with his life and with his art. Who knows? But he was a star, and as a star he had an obligation to perform. The media were interested in the Doppelgaenger-Hemingway-they assumed, a few dissenting voices notwithstanding, that he was the "real" Hemingway. Hemingway's ego was such that it would have been difficult if not impossible for him to admit that the "press release" version of himself, the barrel-chested he-man sipping a Dacquiri with one hand while landing a giant marlin with the other, had taken over center stage and sent the writer to his room.   Hemingway was a natural-born performer. It was part of his personal charm and a not-insignificant factor in what made him a writer. The flair for storytelling in a manner all the more vivid for its understatement had a counterpart in a flair for self-dramatization, whether it took the form of dressing up in a soldier's uniform to have his picture taken for the folks back home in 1918 or grinning ear-to-ear for the cameras after resurfacing from an African safari in 1953 when, after two consecutive plane crashes in Kenya, the press had mistakenly reported him dead. The second of these two plane crashes had in fact very nearly killed him, and what happened afterwards was a particularly grotesque example of the Doppelgaenger Hemingway in the spotlight. Hemingway, suffering from injuries to his liver, spleen, kidney and head, nevertheless met with reporters. An apocryphal version of that press conference got out in which Hemingway had reportedly showed up waving a bunch of bananas and a bottle of gin and boasting that his luck was running good. The story reached the ears of Ogden Nash, who wrote a song about it which was subsequently recorded by Jose Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney: "A bunch of bananas and a bottle of jeen/Keeps the hunger out and the happiness een/A bunch of bananas and a bottle of jeen/My luck she is running very good."   His luck was in fact running out, even though he would win the Nobel Prize a few months later for "The Old Man and the Sea." But the world at large didn't know or, I daresay, even think much about how badly things were turning in the true life of its most celebrated author. Repeated head injuries combined with years of very heavy drinking had taken their toll, and Hemingway's health problems, both physical and mental, would double and redouble until the end finally came in 1961. Suicide ran in Hemingway's family, and the fear that he might commit suicide, as his father had, and as his brother and one of his granddaughters subsequently would, had haunted Hemingway for most of his life. But of course the media-generated version of Hemingway included nothing of this. When Hemingway did finally succeed in bringing about his own demise, many people saw the headline and couldn't believe their eyes. The larger-than-life novelist, the man who had done just about everything in the world you could do, the big-game hunter, bullfight-aficionado, fisherman, connoisseur of fine food and wine, the man who had been at Normandy on D-Day and who had also appeared in countless newspapers and magazines rubbing elbows with people like Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich, a man who, to all appearances, had every reason to go on living, had killed himself?   All the questions were asked. And for a long time, all of the answers were inadequate. Many of those questions would be asked again, just over a year later, when another of America's favorite celebrities decided to go for "the big out." In the nearly 40 years since Hemingway's death, writers, scholars and journalists have been going over the evidence, reconstructing their various versions of what went wrong. But that other celebrity's death is still shrouded in mystery, still being argued. Even Norman Mailer would find the story of Marilyn Monroe intriguing enough to write a book about her.

						   Indian Summer  			 Grief, sir, is a species of idleness. 			 The parked car ticks in its painted slip, 			No breath of air stirs the 			Hundred-million stained-glass windows 			Illuminated in the noontime silence. 			Drought killed the buds of summer early; 			The lingering wasps are getting desperate. 			Sit down to lunch beneath the still tree, 			And they launch airstrikes on your sandwich. 			What is it about this time of year? 			Time’s teeth are on edge, the very afternoon 			A seemingly-endless con game: 			The Washington Post lies face-up 			On the table, masthead and date 			Magnified through a glass of water, 			By sunlight too certain to be real. 			But their implied threat is as loud 			As the wasp-hum is quiet.  Somehow, 			Unlikely as it may seem, things 			Are going to get moving again, 			Their natural round only slowed 			By these impertinences, these piled-up 			Still-life snapshots which will forestall 			No frozen locks, no iced-over windows, 			No future species of idleness. 			This is when you remember things: 			The first day of trout season on the cold lake, 			The floodtide of epiphany in a first kiss, 			The onrushing of early buds in a 			Whirlwind that seemed to contain all 			Potential in itself.  It’s at the first equinox, 			And the first only, when all the great 			Romances of the world get written; 			From here it’s all recollection 			And dread.  On the wall, a woman, 			Beautiful and nearly nude, steps down 			Toward the sea, her back to view, 			Everylastingly mysterious, 			Graceful as the rocking, moon-drugged 			Metronome that waits to embrace her, 			A fugitive from memory, returning home.                                                                             Washington, D.C.                                       October, 1995   			To Nadya, During Mahler’s Third  			The eloquent smugness of April trees: 			Outside, the immensity of returning green, 			As certain as the symphony’s opening phrase, 			Whispers that carousel of the will 			Which sweeps everything along the street. 			Rebirth is a treachery: 			By rights the dead should be left alone. 			The evening sun is a mockery, 			Grist for the ridicule of nightingales. 			Once we walked along a path of birches, 			Ears tuned to hear their peculiar song; 			Above and around us, spring went along 			Mindlessly with its annual outrage, 			While another awaited, just ahead. 			Seasons away now, your bright portrait 			Somehow resists the sun of time— 			Somnolent in my steps, I watch 			It hover, sometimes changing shape, 			Sometimes light or depth of color, 			Floating above the open window, 			As snowflakes swirl or pink bud-showers 			Fall to be squashed by passing cars. 			I found you in a bright November, 			(Give me the honesty of autumn leaves!) 			And now recall colors among this riot 			Altogether different from what I see, 			A karma of night, your eyes’ geometry.                                           April, 1995  									 Listening to Wagner and Looking at Kansas  		Some farmer, scratching his butt 		27,000 feet below mine, 		Would never guess what’s going on 		Up here. 		The fields slide by, criss-crossed, 		Checkerboarded, 		Shades of green fading 		To shades of brown. 		Somewhere down there, 		Someone, no doubt, 		Is worried sick about 		Paying off a loan. 		Up here, the sun makes 		Silver dollars of the Irrigation ponds, And a whole world is falling apart In continuous melody. The plane shakes,  But the painted-on smiles Of the flight attendants Don’t crack as they pass out Fruit and wine coolers. Meanwhile, Brunnhilde launches into Her final act filibuster, Preparing to take her flying leap On to Siegfried’s pyre. The land’s a mottled pool-table As far as you can see. No wonder tornadoes  Get loose down there and don’t stop Until they’ve plunked someone down In the Land of Oz. Accepting a drink And a few strawberries, I settle back, wondering If I’ll know when it’s no longer Kansas we’re over. Landscapes, myths and troubles Have boundaries all their own. The cymbals clash, The trumpets blare, And it’s curtains for the gods Once more.  The plane lurches. I grab my seat, Panicky at turbulence, But it’s OK in a moment, The air is smooth again. And up ahead, beyond the  Horizon even from this height, I know the Mississippi  Flows, a river whose own sagas Are no doubt lost beyond retrieving, Somewhere in the depths Below commercial traffic, Where the water’s just A bit polluted, And no maidens sing.      November, 1985   		Ocean Logic 	(Sunset Beach, San Francisco)  Descartes envisioned a universe That ran on wheels: it’s easy to believe, Watching the surf crash in. I sit on the sand, unabashedly Reading out loud—who gives a damn? The ocean drowns me out, And besides,  On a beach as seedy as this one, What’s one more nut? The ocean beats time In rhythm with my reading. It makes more sense somehow Than the words on the page, Its logic as unperturbed As the merry-go-round of the polar stars. The tugging moon plays on its heart, As a smaller, darker, 		Interior moon plays on mine, 		Infecting its rhetoric a bit perhaps, 		But the message flows on. 		I put my book down and try to tune in, 		Scoping for that music 		Keats thought so divine, 		But it is there?—I can’t tell. 		There’s a freighter going out now, 		A wet-suited surfer just walked by 		On his way to brave the undertow, 		And I’ve got a jingle for Coca-Cola 		Stuck in my head. 		Fugues and discourses 		Of god-knows what kind 		Are lapping the continent’s edge 		One hundred yards in front 		Of my face, and yet 		Their language is as lost on me 		As this poem is on you.                                June, 1985    				Sextet for the Dusk		 				    (Benicia, California)   			Secretive, gulls in figure-eight swirls 			Make halos around St Dominic’s domes. 			Arcane in the breath of their holy 			Indifference, as dusk comes down they 			Head for the delta, like the fire-breathing 			Bombers that razed Dresden, and no less one. 			A runner, meanwhile, whose rhythms of blood 			And heart tick-tock him past the Spanish 			Portico, is ambushed there by gnats 			In a cloud, orbiting the nucleus of their 			Common cause.  Three stray dogs, hot for 			A fourth, dance braids of lust 			In the tall grass of a vacant lot. 			 			The Chinese box of our gravities, 			Sun on sun, in layers of night, 			From house to city to planet to brain, 			Wraps universes in quiet submission, 			The whispered non-language of assent. 			The downward-speaking ricorso rain, 			Lullaby and word, rinses the street, 			But blurs the sharp-edged, defining light. 			“Sleep,” it says, then its work goes on: 			It soaks the cemetery at the city limits, 			Gently erasing the names from the stones.                                  November, 1982   				        The Whipcrack  						I  			A tree seemed a natural place for Dylan back then; 			Just in from Minnesota and not yet a superstar, 			He looks down in those old photographs with just 			A hint of the sardonic grimace young America would 			Ape when it clutched him as a banner.  And he looks so 			Right, bearing that bullwhip down the long 			Country road, ready for all comers, an Indiana Jones 			Of the ideal, poised to battle hypocrisy and greed 			Back to the caves of the unconscious.  Crack, 			Went time’s echo-judgement as the stroke of that 			Whip reverberated for miles and miles 			Over the not-yet famous Woodstock hills.   						II  			The portentious whistle was faintly in the air 			As Strauss lit his candles while the empire faltered, 			Determined to give overwaltzed Vienna what it didn’t 			Want: a magnum opus.  They whirled to his tunes, 			But he could hear a more malevolent kind of 			Acceleration waltz picking up speed above his 			Aging head as they danced and danced.  He prayed 			For rain, the only kind of weather 			That could give him peace, keep the dancers from 			The door.  And so he sat down, pen in hand, 			But time was running out: already the whipcrack 			Heralding the non-tonal storm was in the backswing, 			Gathering momentum in that rainy night.      					III  			Children on the frozen pond, hand-in-hand 			In winter, string out, the wind on their faces and 			Their heads full of Christmas, inscribing joyous 			Nonsense symbols on a frozen slate. 			Arcs, circles and pirouettes scar the surface 			Of what was just a few months ago 			The undisturbed mirror of a summer sky.  Their lives 			Are still andante; a year to them goes on for 			Miles.  Look: they swerve, they swing,  			They crack the whip--scattering like a covey 			Of birds flushed from a thicket, they fly off 			In all directions.  No sound but their inarticulate 			Laughter pierces the deadened December sky.                                 November, 1982    				Prologue in March  			Hushed sunlight—and you remember it again, 			(Here, in places you had nearly forgotten) 			In air that smells of something besides 			Stopped watches.  It wafts through the room. 			The impulse is not to jump up and sing, not quite, 			But to go and seek the echoes in the stairwell 			Of what seemed the cries of demons not long ago. 			Now you’ve bought, with no other currency than 			The accumulated dust on the windowsill, 			One more glimpse through the prism that’s always turning, 			Each facet presenting the same scene 			A thousand miles from the last. 			Neither hope nor despair make any sense now; 			There is in this breath only a colossal never-to-be-defined. 			The drone of an airplane passing overhead 			Recalls the drone of the electric fan that hummed on the table	 			So many midsummers, blowing in from the window 			Those superheated liquors of honeysuckle and jasmine, 			A breeze that made the blood want to throw off its rhythm, Demand the next day, leap into the river 			And drift downstream, an echo of afternoon thunder.                          March, 1988  Up The Street and Through the Cemetery  (Ann Arbor, Michigan)       for Jesus R. Araiza  The frat-houses, hugged By not-quite eastern ivy, Are old-money smug.  			We mock their pretense: 			“Gaudeamus igitur,” 			As we pass the fence.  The graveyard, you say Is an interesting spot. Why not?  Lead the way.  A water-pipe drips, Phallic at the graveyard gate. I miss it, and trip.    You grin, then pause.  “See?   The city disappears here.”   I look, and agree.  The rooftops at bay Are only half the story. Time has backed away.   Granite names preside,  Some recent enough, some aged  To the death of pride.  You whisper a word Appropriately humble; The reply of birds  Stirs up the trees, Echoing your sentiment In a sudden breeze.  Empty cans of beer Rattle in the brown dumpster. “Frat boys party here,”  You say.  “It’s a great Place for Friday-night bashes.” Meanwhile, quite sedate,    Anonymous dust Pays no perceptible heed To frat boys or us.  “So what do we do?” I ask as a family tomb Blocks the sky’s pale blue.  “Nothing,” you reply. “What’s the difference, anyway?” So what if you lie  Beneath beer-drinking Gamma Phi Alphans some night? A similar sinking  Awaits them all too. No use brooding about it. I’ve heard, in Peru,  People come with food And picnic among the headstones, Enjoying the mood.  Multilingual stones Of early Michiganders Stand above their bones:  Here’s one in Chinese-- There, a Spanish influence Molds beneath the trees.  Dates to when the land Was yanked from the Indians Fade from where we stand.    Whole families past Under common granite names Sleep where union lasts:  No discordant word To question what they lived for Is here to be heard.  One stone reads “BABY” For a nameless turnstile life Cut short at “maybe.”  No pair of dates here: Entry and exit took place The same day and year.  The clock tower chimes. We’ve circled to the main gate My watch says it’s time  To go home and cook. Bored, you smack the fence-rails with A paperback book.  Buildings reappear Above the whispering trees, Smiling at the fear  That whispers all around The corners of calm habit. Glad, I greet the town  Silently, as two Possible frat-boys come in, Tossing, as they do,  A frisbee back and forth, (they have two) and then the wind picks up from the north.               June, 1982    Wine-Tasting (St. Helena, California)		      First, the chardonnay: A man dressed like a funeral director Waves around glasses Three at a time. “It’s very drinkable,” he says, Then mumbles something About how long it stood on its head At sixty-eight degrees. A sip, a sidelong glance at you, rolling it around on your tongue. Next, the riesling: Another character (This one looks Levantine) Doles out drops Of the precious stuff While those who didn’t care For the chardonnay dump their dregs  Into a huge pickle jar. As you cross-examine him About sugar content And the time the grapes spent Soaking in their skins, I give my eye to the muscat, (The end of the line) Thinking inappropriate thoughts Of brown-paper bags on skid row. Then comes the cabernet: You don’t care for reds, especially, And tell me so.  Something to do With the acid, you said. But I sniff the blood-colored marvel And let something slip About a well-done steak with mushrooms. This spoils your appraisal As you swallow and giggle. The room’s suddenly friendlier Now, the Sunday tourists From 400 miles around Just a big befuddled family... And now, finally, we reach  That muscat… O, it’s sweet,           It’s a song,                                              It’s the color of your eyes.                                              It cries out for a big, roaring                                               Fireplace somewhere, a sheepdog          And other stage props.                                              (Did I mention that                                              It’s the color of your eyes?)  Then we squint in the daylight, Preparing to drive Another quarter of a mile Down the road, And do all this again. (Champagne’s been promised.) All around, The valley sings your praises As the Sunday sun Gently kisses the vineyards, Working up that sugar content. The newspaper on my lap Says something about Dan White, Just sprung from jail. Would he dare, they ask, Return to San Francisco, The killer of Moscone and Milk? Who cares?  I’m in love!                  March, 1985    			Weightlessness  Some of the seagulls circling that about-to-explode idol Will be dead within the hour from the noise. But some will survive, and would pass the story on, If there were any way they could, of their enormous Counterpart, which tore the curtain of the morning And then disappeared into the sun.  With the window open, I could smell the dawn, and I turned to watch and hear The sparrows on the telephone line, their notes the right hand, Your breathing the ground bass of the left, As the cat jumped down from the lump that had to be Your feet: this morning- counterpoint was reveille for her, And she went off looking for her breakfast. What were you dreaming of when the firecracker That would piggy-back the shuttle into orbit Exploded three thousand miles away?  I wasn’t aware of it Myself—I heard about it later, over coffee,  With the radio on and the cat chasing invisible demons Up and down the stairs.  God, what must it be like, The g-forces mounting, The astronauts suddenly finding Themselves upside-down and staring, as they ride away From earth aboard an earthquake, at a sky deepening From blue to black, and then the release, the sudden Absence, the drifting harness-ends? You stood at the sink in your robe, dishing out cat food. When I stood behind you and kissed your neck, You purred just like the cat.  Sunday: we had hours to fill, And no need to hurry the morning along.  The heavens Were doing quite well by themselves, or maybe Assisted just a little by the human presences: Those singing in churches and those loosed from the earth, Chasing broken satellites. I followed you back upstairs, reaching out to run my hand Along your spine as I counted the steps of your bare feet On the carpet.  The news was over with, the radio Indifferently offering Strauss, and we lay down again and Overcame its indifference, your eyes coming to light as Your robe slipped to the floor, the door closed so that the cat, Still jousting with demons, wouldn’t bring her battle  Into the room.  No battle here, just rising g-forces, And the sky I envisioned turning from blue to black, And the universe warming from the three degrees Kelvin of its Birthing moments, to a warmth wherein our births could be Re-enacted.  Listen—was that a knocking I heard just now On the door downstairs?  No, my mistake…It was the sound (I like to think) of my own knocking on the door of some Creation, the hammer-blows of longing for a reunion With the one whose messenger you are, warming the clouds As we ride a quieter earthquake to our own escape velocity. And there it is—a sudden hush, like the coasting after the burn, A silence like the space between galaxies when the echo Of that great birthing faded to form the microwave whisper Whose message has repeated all these billions of years With no one listening until just now.  Then suddenly I’m floating.  No dangling harness straps, no crackling Radio traffic, no need to do battle with the ticking sky  Or anything else.  This is being weightless,  The purest kind to be found between the other two, The floating in the womb and the drifting toward death, But more like the first I think—the sparrows have left, But dawn noises reverberate in my head as your arms Draw me in, encircling me in a boundary not unlike Beginnings themselves, just as the layers of whispering forever Encircle the shuttle, drifting 200 miles above.                     March, 1985   			The Minimal Muse  To stretch a point, Newton’s Third Law Would have us believe That for every Turangalila, There must be a 4’ 33” Or the other way around. Meanwhile, the poor sap in the middle Shakes his head And switches on the Muzak. “It’s lovely silence, But who can dance to it?”            June, 1985   Voices		  for Lucia  			 			Some follow them to their doom, 			Like the maid, born to burn in 			That more credulous age, who  			Heard in the wind an exhortation 			To drive the invaders out. 			But that was back when the doves 			Came down to take the eyes of the blind 			To heaven, restoring sight 			When they returned to earth. 			Things like that don’t happen anymore.  			If I were to hear voices— 			I can see it now: the woman behind 			The counter down at County Mental Health 			Would reach for her pink form, 			Pencilling in “stress” at line 17b. 			“Take this down the hall,” she’d say. 			“Otro loco mas,” she’d think. 			What happens, then, when you hear 			My voice?  Are forms filled out? 			Do the doves return? 			Rest assured that though  			The ever-widening sky  May take no notice,  while my love burns, you never will.                           April, 1982    			The Sniper  				I  Someone or something always did Your sacred job.  Uncaring sky And primitive paranoia Were your eldest antecedents. From the Assyrian hell-wheels Whirling fear to the marrow Of subjugated bones, to SALT’s Nervous pulse-checking, you were always there.  				II  Passenger planes over the wheatfield Of infinity wait for you As you watch from near the window, And your various shapes invade The flaming tree-tops and the hills. Everything hinges on your choice For those who fall within the range Of your sight, and are within you.  				III  Einstein’s face stares from the textbook, Seeming burdened with all he knew. A picture that seems meant for walls Where teachers drone and students yawn. But in another picture, where, Mugging for the camera, tongue stuck out, He takes the smug ones quite off-guard, I’d like to think he just dodged you.   				IV  Paramedics playing poker At midnight on a Saturday,  Breathing between catastrophes, Inhale that heavy air for life. Not too interested, they look out From the back of the van at one. A night’s work is just a night’s work: The shifts they stand are two nights long.  				V  So who can ever go between Your dark intent and our mistakes? Distinguishing malevolence From rainfall is not for our kind.

July, 1978   			Gumball Universe  Eleven dimensions now, they say. The knobby surface of reality runs Beneath my fingertips, mercurial, unseen. We were just getting a grip on the ones We had, still trying to fine-tune our fears to the ins and outs of matter and Energy either sunflowering in that burst  Of horror that’s haunted our most recent Long sleep, or smoldering, a mean dog Unaware, but growling as you pass from habit. And then this came along.  What next? Will they fashion some new malevolence out of it, Or will it remain the sole property of the Priesthood, they with the unpronounceable names, Who tend to address themselves in integers? Every day they reshape the unshapeable, While, at the galaxy’s core, something unnameable Is already ordering something unspeakable: A wholly new alphabet, a rewriting and reordering Of all the holy books ever written.                        March, 1985   			Whiteout                 (Vacaville, California)  It’s the deadest Sunday of the year, 		and the year’s just getting started— Consider that. 		Not quite time for the Super Bowl: How will we survive? You can feel it, time,  oozing from a million living rooms, Feel it as you walk to the laundromat, Or watch your breath Materialize. Even the church crowd is hiding out Somewhere. What there is, 			of course, 				       is fog. It drifts and drips                and runs along the windowpanes, 					the icing on silence. You can get lost in it, and somehow Today, I think, everyone would like to. Even “60 Minutes” is miles away; For the moment there’s only basketball 					and Jimmy Swaggart. The fog gives the percolator’s bubbling an urgency, makes the pine needles on the patio, (from where the Christmas tree was dragged away) So mutely elegaic, and urges such a General anonymity… What it whispers as it 			           			streams down the windows Is clearer than  the streaming windows themselves. The only thing we really need now Is one good snowfall  to wake us all up within view  of the Emerald City’s gates.                          January, 1985    To Marina on her Birthday 		 			There was a time when you wouldn't 			Have thought twice about them, 			The second looks and double-takes 			Attending each venture 			You made along the street. 			But in these days of the phone 			Off the hook at sunset,  			And the solitary walks around 			The old neighborhood, I hear 			Sometimes you catch yourself 			In the long fluorescent glance 			And think "No, I don't look 			So very much different--still, how 			Could they?"  They do.  Take my 			Word for it: I've watched, myself, 			(Trying not to get caught) 			As you made your way down some 			Yawn of a corridor,  			A splash of delight, bright in 			Our general sleep-walk, rousing 			That never-aging catch of breath 			That so often becomes song. 			For all the summers you've been 			Part of, all you've seen and heard, 			Smelled, touched and tasted, 			And in the shadow of every word, 			Foreign to me, familiar to you, 			That spells out your other- 			Looking-glass life, still I envy 			Those chimerical, bright-as-you-are 			Mid-Atlantic birds that attend 			Your May morning walks to 			Safeway or CVS...Having seen both 			Them and you, there's no doubt 			I think, that grace and beauty 			Have rules of their own, and where 			And when they choose to speak 			Or put in an appearance, 			The rest of us can only smile, 			Scratch our heads, and try to be 			Worthy of the moment.                              July, 1998  During Barber’s “Adagio for Strings”  The most longed-for moment is never the furthest away: Imagine the ultimate 2 a.m. under fog, The night as silent and bright as remembrance, The universe illuminated in the orange glow of that Artificial moon,  sleeping city light rising, The cloud-ceiling phosphorescent. Move from the corner room, where the dim sky Illuminates nothing, over the profile of the highrise And down to the street itself. Here there are no Declarations. The clock on the Security Pacific Bank Building chimes an everlasting frozen hour; The police car standing on the corner might be Unoccupied, its engine silent and its headlights all its own. No answers are heard, but the questioner is celebrated With a mute tenderness: footsteps out of the moon and fog; They carry you down to the street where, loud as midday, The rustle of an irrelevant newspaper affronts the stars.                        June, 1990  Six Love Songs         Music: Jesus R.

In my time 			I hope I may 			Be like the leaf: 			You’ll turn away, 			Your words unsaid, 			Your eyes gone dry. 			I’ll say nothing 			As you pass by.

The cadence stops.  You’re opening the door. 			A flood of pictures comes in on the click, 			And hidden rains of ancient melodies: 			The fevered music of the deathly sick. 			Yet when you speak, your voice upon my ear 			Is sweet, but not the music that it seems 			When you’re far off.  The sunlight on your face 			Is not, perhaps, as lovely as in dreams. 			The crisis comes: I reach to take your hand, 			And though I shake, the walls stubbornly stand.   					III  			I dreamed my love were dead, 			And I smiled as she lay 			Naked at my feet, 			A vanquished enemy.  			But morning took a hand 			And pulled me back to earth, 			The jacket on the chair, 			The day and day’s preserve.  			Later, when I saw you 			Sitting at your desk, 			A lion passed the window, 			But then lay down to rest.   					 					IV  			Morning got in here 			Without being frisked. 			No one asked the day 			Its business or intent. 			March flows into April 			Naturally as night; 			Who would ever want to 			Demand its credentials? 			Entropy envelopes 			The entire sleeping earth 			In one-way fluid faith. 			And the elemental you, 			As of the earth as stone, 			But above it as Polaris, 			(Unflinchingly that way) 			Must surely wake to day’s 			Unfrisked arrogance 			Equal at all times 			To whatever it demands, 			Chosen and in time, 			Subject to a law 			Binding you alone. 			Your little finger’s ring 			Glimmers with your intent: 			A crack in the sky considers 			Each impaling hour. 			It holds at your discretion, 			And at your will explodes.   				   V  			Ocean, clock and sky conspire 			In their dark complicity, 			Pulling you from my embrace.  			Ocean, large as night itself, 			Comes in, goes out, its rhythm still 			Pulsing like the blood’s demand.  			Clock, a spinning manmade will, 			Blindly speaks its own intent, 			Ticking fast when we would wait.  			Sky sweeps toward a breaking dawn, 			Hushed around its polar way, 			Threshing through the dark we share.  			But you and I grab stolen gems: 			The seconds that we steal away 			Are ours alone when darkness ends.   					VI  			Now throw aside 			All pettiness 			And come with me 			Into this light. 			Our bodies fit 			Like dovetailed dreams; 			Together we 			Invade the night.    			 			Sadness, defiance, 			Joy between 			The canyon of us, 		 			The valley of you, 			Paint the rocks 			Of cold desire. 			Now climb the cliffs 			And see the view:  			A galaxy’s heart. 			Naked, you are 			The center of all, 			The beginning sun. 			I lie in your core 			As skies explode, 			Hidden in you, 			The completing one.                                                           1979-81     Es ist Genueg		  		In Alban Berg’s great Violin Concerto, 		After a series of tutti hammer-blows, 		And after a quirky glance back at Vienna, 		The woodwinds talk some older talk	 		Still: that "alter Duft aus Maerschenzeit" 		--scent of other times—appears and grows, 		A scent Schoenberg would have recognized, 		And Mahler (had he lived) might have brought home. 		It hints at you, among the rattling 		Dishes and the ringing telephones; 		The lotus of tranquillity in you 		And the chorale are much the same. 		They speak a common language at the bottom 		Of the mind, echoing in the mists of 		Tonal instinct, seeping from the crazy- 		Quilt of time.  Yes, you and the music 		Are of a common kind: two echoes   		Of vintage sweetness in the toneless street 		Where the noises rising from the workshops 		Make that harmony more precious still, 		In the way you have, and do—the way you will.

September, 1997  							  		M51  Old Messier made himself a list Of things that could be lightly missed: Numbered, toss-out points of light, Distractions to his busy night. He was on the comets' trail, And never thought beyond the pale Of Newton's clockwork universe-- These light-puffs were a nightly curse. Now, spinning in a photograph, This whorl, (which Messier thought chaff) Some thirty million years away Appears much like the Milky Way. Old Messier would never know He'd forced the universe to grow; These "sands upon the Red Sea shore" Were not what he was looking for.            July, 1997  Joshua Blues         In memory of Richard M. Bettez, 1957-1980  Running deeper than remembrance in these bones, Richard, Are the fading pictures—remnants—of what we once were. Look, though: the desert you loved to paint stays  Essentially the same—the land, the 40-mile horizon, And of course the joshua, that enormous tree Whose portrait you once painted, then brought Around to my house.  We talked as I brewed tea.  Now you’ve joined Picasso, whose vision you once Panned, all those years ago, sketching in Bic pen A crosseyed Cubist man, which you then Showed around for laughs in the high-school halls. Proof yourself that an artist could out-dance An athlete, you went out for sports nonetheless, Chased after girls, loved life—a painter one minute, A rocker the next, then again something neither could name.  Fat chance you had, once you decided to choose The mire of that suburb which nurtured us both Like feedlot steers, as a place to come back to. Drifting death, that jellyfish, floating White on the water of our recalcitrant years, Marked your return, watched over the road, Then gently let down his tentacles to brush you As late one night, you drove too fast in the dark.  Once we talked of travelling, partners to Paris, That summer I was pumping gas and mopping bay floors While you copied Constable’s The Hay Wain. We never went, but you, loving landscapes, looked closer to home for what you could secure As your private domain. The desert?  You could have it. And now I’m living there, watching desolation bear Down--the perimeter of mountains saw-tooths hot sky.    But the joshua tree is out there somewhere, Clinging to its is-ness, stark silhouette of patience, Like the land all around.  If I should come across it While driving in circles, finding nothing else Worthy of note, I may not be sweetly mugged By the muse of your release, but you never know. You went before the rest of us, first to flower, And then to embrace death’s dirty logic,  And now it’s the joshua as well as Picasso Whom you’re privileged to join in its petrified peace, Whose secret is the mastery of that elusive art, Homing in on the landscapes of the desert and the heart.  				March, 1981    			Dirty Birds  Would you say That there’s a little of the seagull in all of us? That putting aside all the  Romantic hogwash About complete freedom, And all the freudian nonsense Imbedded in the desire To fly,  Would you say That there’s a deep-seated yearning In some forgotten corner of the best of us To be tick-ridden, filthy, Despised by sunbathers who don’t like White deposits  plunked in their navels, And forced to live on floating garbage?  Buddhists might say That your karma’s kicking up, And that maybe, just maybe The next time around, You’d do well to set your sights A little bit higher.             May, 1985      	 Page One  It’s not the sound of bursting bombs, But the low whispers of l’infame That shake this card-house in the night, Which rose in artificial light In that unspeakable grinning face. Not the whine of planes in strings As the terrified quartet sings, Remembering the fevered hours Of air-assaults and horror’s flowers Blooming above the roofs in flames, But rather, those who have no names Under a collective hood: They mouth a common, choral good And follow one who sniffs the breeze And maybe marvel at the ease With which they let themselves be led. O tell me, is the hero dead, And that which killed him in the street? He lies beneath the led ones’ feet As the bewildered mumble psalms And piped-in music calms and calms. 			   	Karma Bum  Sticky night air Hammers at his wakefulness, And in the darkness he listens hard… For what? Some blank, redeeming sound In the promise of morning? No—his ears are tuned To the sound of His own heart, Wrapped in envelopes Of accumulated jet-noise, Radio static And curses long ago spat out And remembered. He strains to hear The bird’s wing on the night air, Frozen in the act of its homing. “The angels mark Your every step,” he’s told. “The tightrope may snap At any moment,” he hears. Where in the ticking sky Is the mirror he seeks? Those who went before, (How he struggles To imagine their faces!) Far outnumbering  Those who stand around, Line up behind him, Shaking the core of his Fibrous interior galaxy With a universal sigh Of what he hopes is peace.                        Ann Arbor, Michigan                       May, 1982       	Going Back To Ithaca  They tell me that Shelley was disappointed    The day he ran down to the docks and saw The curly-haired Greeks who reeked of garlic    And sweated in the sun as they unloaded Some cargo or other.  They were not the Greeks    He knew, only having met marble Greeks Himself.  Poor Percy—before his startled eyes,    Under a cherished and well-fostered notion The columns crumbled.  What was he out looking for in that harbor?    Perhaps only a link with the source of us, Some reminder of beginnings: a dreaming    Descendant, his eyes deceived by his training, Marble-conditioned, looked for a marble forebear.    (And I am told that even now, young Greeks, When those glorious books are put in their hands,    Puzzle over them like a high-school kid Required to swallow “Beowulf.”)  So what did it matter to my friend’s sister Debra,    That the ghosts of great men moved all around her When she went down to the docked destroyer,    Sons-in-tow in some hellenic port, To greet the man she was to marry?    There was no sad surprise in her eyes When that soulless gray bucket (bought from America)    Yielded him up.  If there were any old statues there, I imagine she stood with her back to them    And smiled.                                             October 27, 1974   Terminalia  “Did Rome become ruins, Or do ruins become Rome?” Ruins do seem to fit the script: “Rome,” it reads.  “Crumbling marble.” And now, when people think of ruins, They think of Rome.   Irony: when the theater Of all the Aegean’s past glory, And the eastern half of “Mare Nostrum” Were only a corner of what was Rome’s, no patrician in his right mind Would dream that stage-setting, Not even on a morning after, When thoughts of further conquest Could only aggravate his Aristocratic headache.  This occurred to me when, Late one night, yawning every  Fifteen seconds, I thought about The roses I’d sent to your door. There were twelve, in a glass vase. They were left on the step, And I was angry when I found out, Thinking that they could have been Stolen before you returned. But there they were, on the table, And you came to me, (your hair was wet) And threw your arms around My neck.  I glanced over at The yellow roses, and wished They had been open then. They were embryonic, like your thoughts. They were thoughtless, like your eyes. They bloomed while I was gone, And were opened up The next time I dropped by. Within a week, they had  Turned brown, and you regretted Not having pressed one in a book.  Then they went the way Of all garbage, and I felt sadness, Not for eighteen bucks out the door, But for having given you Something that would die. Tonight, however, I don’t think anything More permanent could have been so right. Disease demands the price It will, and time has moved Only slightly, but slightly  Was enough.  Lent now: A week ago last Wednesday, The reader smeared some ashes On my forehead, and told me I was going back to dust. A thousand years from now, (If they have Ash Wednesday then) I’d like to think the reader, Smearing ashes borne of me On someone else’s forehead, Might think of Rome and roses As well as Lentan things; For you, if for no one else, They were love’s best-chosen gift.                          February, 1977        	 Good Night, Good Night 	         The bass drum pounding in the kitchen sink Goes unnoticed as the moonlight moves A little further westward.  Do you think You’re equal in heart to what the moonlight proves?  You’re not alone: the moonlight on your face Silently complements the distant siren-sound As, across the city, two police cars race To where some drunk lies bleeding on the ground,  Having been rolled.  You do not hear: Your contentment’s unchallenged as the dawn comes on: You dream the right dreams, have nothing to fear As sailors stumble home when the moonlight’s gone.                                                May 5, 1977      	Apricot Brandy  Proust was right: there are moments when time Turns back on itself and, transparent, Pulls back your eyes from the persistent crime Of one-way motion and blindness.  And then the illusion of travelling power Reveals what may be or may not, (In a grain of sand on the beach of an hour) An independent reality.  Four years flew back in his startled face When he uncorked the bottle, And what hurried past was too complex to trace In the odor of apricot brandy.  A midnight, a high wind, a batch of caresses, A moment when a friend now dead Still walked the streets, girls in short dresses: It all raced by, inhaled in an instant,  And was gone.  O was it, I wonder, that quick breath Like the moment of life’s unreeling We’ve all heard about at the moment of death, And the culprit was apricot brandy?                                    January, 1978   Faithful Physics		  A dissonance of voices, both strange and familiar, echoes From every corner: a standing-in-the-middle of things becoming, In combination with things imagined, or as we hoped they were. Pick your corner: on which does the marketplace go mad, On which does the guitar player easily pluck his strings? Are they where we put them yesterday, or did they move While we slept?  Harmonies themselves ring strange, A standing-in-the-middle of colors that shift and skate On the surface of what world?  Do the poplars bend as the exile Imagines, or in a wholly new direction, obedient to The whisperings of possibly-hostile winds?   Compassion holds his hand back as he raises it to strike The spider crawling up the bookcase—or is it compassion? The uncertainties of the whirlpool come yawning, And in them is imbedded the possibility that he may be Forced to see the world sometime the way a spider sees it. Achor yourself on a chain of the expected: The bubbles in the glass rise for a reason. Then again, what if those molecules were to go into open revolt? The window might become an angry eye staring inward, The world-globe on top of the shelf a fist Looking for something to smash—or is there too much sense Even in that, a hope that the whirlpool can be trusted To go along with the logic of our nightmares? Looks once readable take on a catlike strangeness, A standing-in-the-middle of a most peculiar entropy. Do the sunlight shafts, striking your face this morning, Incline as they did the first day we awoke together, When the doves who had escaped the hunters’ shotgun blasts Rang like bells in the field outside, and the mountains Rimming the desert hummed like buddhas?  Was it even, I wonder, the same sun?  It hasn’t blinked once, but the light Has changed: books unread multiply on the shelf where the Spider crawls, the furniture has gotten more worn, And there’s a resonance, a dimly-hollow bell-echo, Not fading, but building to an almighty shriek That could only make us run for cover. The boomeranging forces of the whirlpool, growing Like acre-feet of nuclear waste, leave us with the ever-more Desperate search for a place where they can be safely stored, Until their half-lives have run full circle, and their enlightened molecules lie down To hum their own mysterious peace.                                                     March, 1984    	Snowflakes         to a small child glimpsed at Safeway  When I was young and you were unimagined, A compass in a circle, I looked out At a landscape only as wide as I dreamed, And peopled and colored it with what seemed The very best the kaleidescope (my gift at birth) Could whirl into being.  And you were looking At me like that—you had the same secret Strength, a god unaware, Riding along in that shopping cart, Leaving it to your mother to worry about More earthbound, less-important things.  I waved, you stared.  What background place In the lonely circle you’re building yourself Will I occupy?  The sun, the sky, the circumference As it looks to you are yours alone, As mine were, before that circle widened, And everything shrank to its appointed place. Worlds like snowflakes: within the space You occupy, (as I once did) where trees Could be monsters, sunrises gifts, And holidays lurked beyond the horizon Like joyous constellations waiting to rise, Everything you see, singular crystals, Was there to be arranged as I saw fit, And now it’s your turn.  So build away, And live as long as you’re allowed In the magic circle of that divine neurosis, Doomed to grow until you awake one day To find the process of its destruction Suddenly complete, the boundaries you laid out Nowhere to be seen, the colors dulled, The constellations set, The mysterious noises just distracting sound, The snowflakes melting as they hit the ground.                                            July, 1983    	Any Two Things                      for Holly       At Chartres cathedral (they tell me) you can see God    the Geometer, holding a huge compass, and some of the more mystically-minded still regard    Pythagoras as being on the right track. Probabilities themselves, they say, prove that there is    an Alpha and Omega behind the veil. Imagine, for instance, the odds against two flies in    that very cathedral, buzzing past God’s nose, and somehow managing to bump into each other.    Now multiply that a few quadrillion times, And you’ve got the odds against two random electrons    finding each other in a blank endlessness. Then there’s the one we’ve all heard, the “typing monkey” scene:    Statisticians say if the little buggers Jumped up and down long enough, they’d manage to write not    only “War & Peace,” but all of Shakespeare’s plays, and even the grocery list I tossed out this morning.    That makes us a cosmology in ourselves, I think.  We were born on opposite sides of the world,    six years apart, and the credulous would say that our meeting, when it happened, was no accident.    Then again, what if it were dictated from  nowhere, then taken down by a zillion cosmic monkeys?    How pretty a world does that augur for us? You asked me how I write, and this is how I do it:    (or how it happens, anyway) I’m a void Where any two things will meet and spark, and a third is born.    I speak, we touch: the word and the touch are things in themselves, their existence outside my volition,    yet they spark, giving birth to angels and suns. Islam teaches that everything began with a sneeze.    I think of that, when I think of how you laughed the time I told you how I sneeze when I get horny.    But when you come right down to it, it’s a lovely thought that each time I desire you, I make a universe.                Frankfurt-am-Main,                May 18, 1986     	Broadway Melody	          for Henry Miller   What kind of night is darker than big-city night? (Big-city night under a billion watts of light, That’s the hell of it.) How in the world did you endure that world Of love in smoke-filled rooms, Where the men didn’t take their hats off, And the women didn’t smile? A dance floor in hell: all those Nickels in all those Slots in all those Machines in all those Automats—ugh, no wonder You wanted to sing five thousand year-old songs, Get drunk on water, Speak any language that never heard a Brooklyn accent, Wag your hard-on at the sun. The time of the assassins has come and gone. Welcome to the hour of the wet ankles, The time-bomb ticking in the blood, The air-conditioned nightmare gone condo. But you carried bigger bombs inside yourself, And I can see you, flinging them left and right, From a bicycle all the better for being imagined, Pedalling along streets whose shrieks of protest To you and you alone  Sounded like Scriabin, Faster than the speed of bullshit, More powerful than a loaded motive.                                    December, 1988   	CELLO  They said: “The sense of this music is like the patterns of the grain in wood.” You stand in the corner. The pattern of the grain in wood harbors secrets, And no less the demand of your presence, insistent, by dint of the very eloquence Of mute potentiality, and the unspeakable tautness that you imply into the air: Somehow, someone is compelled to make music here. To make music, the original demand, not the flick of a switch That frees you up to let your thoughts wander as something called “music” Fills the room. Sorting what you demand…it isn’t easy, nor necessarily enjoyable: Participating in mysteries not very often is.  The sublime implies catastrophe. The tightrope-walker may smile, afterward, watching the videotape, But not when he’s picking his way slowly forward, under lights and over eyes. This morning I tucked my pocket watch into the change-pocket of my jeans. I take it out now, pop it open, see that it’s early afternoon, the sky outside gray,  The upright coffin over there summoning without a sound, bringing to mind The story of the Russian beauty who told the poor smitten clod to bring her The tsarina’s shoes, and then, maybe, he might get what he wanted. Now, in all your elegance, you rest—but not rest at all—against my shoulder, Between my knees, poised, your strings making that most impossible And at the same time most promising demand against slightly-calloused fingers: Then slowly, in motions repeated that they might be as automatic as breathing, I try to bring out of you (watch ticking, small sweat starting up on my forehead) A Bach prelude, but not just a Bach prelude, no, that wouldn’t be enough-- It has be a singularity, a once-in-a-universe, never-to-be-repeated event, Or it has somehow failed to honor the music in that way we all agree It must, only no two of us can agree on just what defines that quality. Something disturbs the air. It’s not for me to say if the mysteries have been Well-served; in this ritual I’m the communicant who waits to see whether The goddess is pleased or not with the offering tossed on the fire. She—you—remain mute as the afternoon light when the bow is laid down. Nothing left now but the instant replay in the mind, and the question That cannot, in this silence, find a definitive answer: mystery Remains mystery, despite the point of order poked in the veil by these Tremulous notes that reverberate even now, in fingers that can remember. When I was a child I used to imagine shapes in a dish of strawberry jello: Red  was a threatening color, implying adventure, danger, the unknown. To the woman in the story of the tsarina’s shoes it implies the beautiful, But not to me at five: “There’s a lion in there, there’s a lion in there, “ I whispered. Now, in the heavy, questioning silence of after, in which the watch And the light might constitute either a mockery or a reply, I find a lion lurking as well in these wood-grain patterns of mystery, Waiting, indisputable, promising only that she’ll pounce in her own good time.

Unremembered hills Rise up, through steam unseen, But seeming still An echo of hills inside Yourself, Resonating silences From this noisy earth. The rain streams down: past Faded signs, locals plod Along the road, Oblivious and wet.  The hills Are too far away to walk. I clamp on my Walkman, talk Flagging in the heat, And sound, strangely confident With joy invades this  Pre-flood scenery.  The Second Brandenburg, That miracle which rose From Europe’s own soul- Dampening drizzle, defies The jungle thunderheads, until We park the car beside the road To snap away at wildlife.  There I get into a stare-down with a jacare, immobile as Those thunderheads.  The agate Of his eye encapsulates The jungle afternoon; his perch On the swamp-bank brooks No back-talk from me. Suddenly, mosquitoes Are the roar inside  My head.  That, at least, I manage to subdue with Bach. That’s not for him, though: He’s old as thunder, And doesn’t blink.

Now it’s the lobby, the bar or the street: 		I can’t go upstairs yet—the maids will have broken 		Into my room for the towels and sheets.  		The bellhops, the desk clerks, they’re all deferential; 		Their English is good, though they don’t know your name. 		Here you’re well cared-for, with all the essentials, 		And each night your room looks exactly the same.

To miss by inches  Goes unnoticed here, And timetables should be posted On every street sign: Padre Joao Manuel to the Avenida Paulista, ETA 45 minutes, Give or take the eternity between Two shock-enjambed heartbeats, And the mopping-away of sweat. No one but cabbies should invade this whacked-out pinball game,  A slow-motion stampede under a Swamp-miasma of gasohol, Breath of a thousand year-old wino At the most neon hour of the night, And not even a cabbie, until He’s racked up enough confirmed kills To command the respect of his peers. Honking high noon: the luncheon crowd Sipping espresso at the Café Almanara Is treated to a wedding’s worth  Of racket when someone stalls A derelict VW at the corner. O dear God no—not a cloudburst, Not now… But it lets up in minutes,  And the streets become A steaming ice-rink in the  Late-November sun.  Now poise at the curb’s edge,  Urban cliff-diver; don’t slip—   You’re not at home here; You won’t understand those Last-second curses, And the bus driver? He won’t even look back.               November, 1988  					 The Island Around the Corner  From the island around the corner, Where dawn is an act of willing, The vicissitudes of midnight Puncture the sailor’s dreams. His unlikely dreams of landfall Satellite-photo that coastline, As time takes the face of icebergs, And the snapshot-clocks are stupid, And the vestals of morning stoke Beach fires that burn without light On the island around the corner.  On the island around the corner, Where the coiled springs all lie broken And the keys to the locks are misplaced Beyond cobweb-ripping light, No codebreaker holds bright vigil, Or boasts of the blueprints to sorrow, And the sailor who hears the waves breaking Wakes up to find only calm sea.

						   I  This week my subscription to National Review magazine, ordered about two weeks ago, kicked in.   In yesterday’s mail I received NR’s special commemorative edition on the recent passing of Ronald Reagan.   I was reading it last night in class, to prevent myself from falling asleep out of sheer boredom during the first of a months’ worth of lectures on bankruptcy, the final section of a paralegal course I’m taking at the University of San Diego. Every essay in this issue is dedicated to some aspect of Reagan or his legacy.   I found something in one of the essays thought-provoking to say the least: I reflected on it in the car all the way home from school.   Among the authors who contributed encomiums to the late president was historian Paul Johnson, author of “Modern Times,” one of the best books on 20th Century history I ever read, by the way.   Describing the situation Reagan inherited when he was first elected president in 1980, Johnson wrote:   “The 1970s had seen a president forced to retire in disgrace, and an unelected president with no mandate, beaten in turn by a feeble Democrat from the south who had no obvious policy or coherent view of the world. In Washington, a triumphant but leaderless Congress usurped executive authority, allowing a triumphant Soviet Union, and its surrogates in Cuba and Vietnam, to do what they willed in Africa and Asia. America’s apparent decline as a great power was symbolized, in a terrible moment early in 1980, by a shocking military fiasco in Iran.”   I could add my own lugubrious memories of the 1970s to Johnson’s: gas lines. The Chevy Vega and the Ford Pinto. Stagflation. Unemployment soaring toward 10 percent. The U.N. transformed into a Third World debating society, with America blamed for every problem on earth. Mason Reese.   And Johnson didn’t bother to mention, but I will, the spectacle of Americans clinging to helicopters to get out of Saigon as the situation in Vietnam finally collapsed on April 30, 1975. (On that same subject, I also remember the 1975 Academy Awards show on television, at which the anti-American film "Hearts and Minds," about Vietnam, won the Oscar for Best Documentary. As if that weren’t bad enough, when two of the hip-and-trendy left-wingers who had been involved in the production got up to accept the award, they crowed to an approving audience of how South Vietnam was about to be “liberated.” In Hollywood anyway, little has changed.)    As for roller disco, polyester leisure suits and big, ugly medallions, well, to paraphrase Mark Twain, we’ll draw the curtain of charity on that.    It’s hardly surprising that Jimmy Carter, when he sought re-election as president in 1980, had to resort to desperate scare-tactics: Democrats pitched a vision of Reagan as a bug-eyed, right-wing maniac who would abolish Social Security with one breath and mash his thumb on the nuclear button with the next. There wasn’t a single thing in his own record that Carter could point to as evidence that we should re-elect him, which left his campaign with no strategy except to demonize Reagan, which is all it did, and to no avail, because by 1980 America had clearly had enough.   In November, 1979, when our embassy in Iran was overrun, (it was just a month later, by the way, that Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan) things had been sliding steadily from bad to worse for six years, starting with the Watergate mess in ’73, and there was very little expectation amongst Americans that they would ever get better.   Tom Wolfe famously called the 1970s the “Me" decade, but the catch-phrase I remember much better from those years is “lowered expectations.” The Oscar for Best Picture of 1976 went to Sylvester Stallone’s "Rocky," a movie in which a from-nowhere prizefighter is offered a miraculous shot at the heavyweight title, only to realize before the fight even occurs that he has no chance of winning, and announces that he just wants to “go the distance,” in other words, he’s willing to settle for second best. Willingness to settle for second best had never been an American core value, and perhaps "Rocky" reflected the era’s malaise in much the same way that the film which followed it as Best Picture the very next year, "Star Wars," reflected a concomitant thirst for pure escapism. In 1933 Americans crowded into theaters to watch top-hatted Fred Astaire dance with slinky Ginger Rogers and thereby escape for a couple of hours the horrors of the Great Depression. In 1977 they crowded into theaters to watch Luke Skywalker dance with Darth Vader, probably for much the same reason. I remember well the fanfare that attended the appearance of "Star Wars," the runaway summer hit of that year: “It’s the return of...ENTERTAINMENT!” The reviews trumpeted, and all summer long, John Williams’ stirring orchestral prelude to the movie blared from radios all over the country. In the long view off the caboose of the train, all that hyperbole and fanfare seems a collective sigh of relief.   In short, the 1970s were a very bad decade for America, and Reagan, according to Johnson, affected an almost miraculous turnaround in the nationwide, and worldwide situation during his eight years in office. He restored our national confidence, stage-managed the destruction of the Soviet empire and brought America back to a role of pre-eminence on the world scene. The ‘70s were the disease and Reagan was the cure.   But here’s what got me thinking: those godawful ‘70s were also the decade in which I came of age. And despite all of the introspection I’ve been doing in my personal journals for more than 30 years now, I have never really made any serious attempt to come to grips with my own relationship to the era in which I grew up, and how it may have affected my entire life. I’ve written at length of how my father, who came of age during the Depression, let that traumatic experience shape his attitudes and behavior for the rest of his days, but I have written little or nothing of how my own experience of being a “‘70s kid” might have profoundly influenced the kind of man I became in the ‘80s, ‘90s and right up until today, as I write this at the age of 48.   Surely, some of the most important years of anyone’s life are the period between their teens and early twenties. Goals, dreams, ambitions and attitudes that will last a lifetime are forged between early adolescence and the time when you’re launching yourself on the great world as a young adult. On January 1, 1970 I was 14 years old. On January 1, 1980, I was 24. I graduated from high school in 1973, from college in ’77. If anyone can legitimately claim to be a product of the 1970s, it’s those of us who were born around the end of the first Eisenhower administration, circa 1955. Our parents came of age in a time of national economic disaster and psychological pain, and we in turn came of age in a period of national economic lassitude and psychological numbness. (By the way, I’ve mentioned the fate of the Soviets a couple of times; it’s a curious fact that Russians tend to view the 1970s in much the same way we do: the years of Leonid Brezhnev are referred to in post-Soviet Russia as “the period of stagnation.”)   It’s an accepted principle that our capitalist, free-market economy runs in cycles of boom and bust. Perhaps the national mood follows a similarly cyclical pattern. The malaise of the ‘30s was corrected by World War II, which in turn ushered in a period of such confidence that many were speaking of an “American Century” beginning in 1945. Our sudden postwar affluence resulted in a burgeoning middle class whose satisfaction with its newly-found prosperity shaped the 1950s, a decade (perhaps unjustly) characterized as a spiritual and intellectual wasteland, whose contrary symbols were the gray flannel suit and the beatnik T-shirt that was a response to it. The confidence in their own and America’s future which was instilled into babies born during the war and nourished by the optimism of the Kennedy years, led in turn to the waves of college-campus idealism of the early 1960s. That spirit promptly found fertile ground in the Civil Rights movement, and created a general confidence among the younger generation that it could change the world for the better, which was promptly dashed to pieces by the Vietnam war. In response to the war, the hippies, who were the younger descendants of the beats of a decade earlier, turned on, tuned in and dropped out as the country watched war, assassination and inner-city rioting explode all over its TV sets. My older sister once characterized the 1960s as a period when, for ten years, “the whole country threw up.” Pop culture, so often a good reflection of the time that produces it, telescoped the experience of the decade quite neatly as it came to a close: Woodstock engendered Altamont in short order. In the words of one commentator, the counter-culture “went from flower-power to death-tripping in a matter of months.”   Tired of the constant turmoil and upheaval that the years of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson had brought with them, in 1968 America turned to Richard Nixon, and the rest is not just history, it’s my personal history, mine and everyone else’s who was born about the same time I was. Nixon was elected for his first term on Nov. 4, 1968. Reams have been written about what a tumultuous year ’68 was; I won’t get into that here. The important thing is, on the night Nixon was elected, I had just turned 13. I was primed and ready to become a ‘70s kid.    II  I don’t even have to think very long or very hard to come up with an example of how I was sideswiped by the 1970s in a highly personal way.   As the decade began, I was a teenager with understandably little perspective on what was happening with the country or the world at large. We were Republicans and conservatives in my family; on the morning when Nixon was declared the winner of that very-close ’68 campaign against Hubert Humphrey, my father got up and hugged my mother. It was good news in our household: after eight years of chaos ruddered by Democratic presidents, the country would now get back to normal. So we thought, anyway. I was of course aware of Vietnam as a child, and at our house we supported the war effort; as a Republican family we believed that the crusade against world Communism was rightly America’s number-one priority. Social issues could wait until the Communist hydra had been slaughtered. Of course, as the war dragged on, even my parents’ perspective on it began to change. My father, as staunch a Republican as you could ask for, declared some time in the early ‘70s that he was “By-God beginning to understand how the young people in this country feel” about the war. Clearly, even his patience with it was beginning to wear thin, and My Lai certainly didn’t help, although my father was with those who felt that William Calley was just a patsy for the higher-ups. I had no inkling of it at the time of course, but I think now that, as 1973, the year in which I would turn 18 and become eligible for the draft approached, my father was beginning to worry about Vietnam getting its clutches on me.   As it turned out, I was spared by inches: the last American to be drafted into the armed forces was inducted on June 30 of that year. I turned 18 on October 12. Draft registration was still required of course, and I dutifully went over to city hall and filled out my draft form. I promptly received a notice in the mail that I had been classified “1-H,” a holding category. They were no longer drafting anyone. Two years later the draft was formally abolished.   In that summer of 1975, I was visiting my oldest and dearest childhood friend, Jim Provenza, at his parents' house in Camarillo, California. These days Jim is a middle-aged lawyer with college-age kids, but in those days he was a young firebrand of the left, ardently loyal to and active within the Democratic Party, who dreamed of becoming the next John F. Kennedy and changing the face of America. I'm happy to report that just months ago, at age 48, Jim got himself elected to the Davis, California school board. Way to go, Jim. We're all proud of you. Hope you're enjoying the 16-hour days and the hate mail.   It was Jim who informed me that summer day that I no longer even needed to carry my draft card in my wallet.   We quickly organized a little ceremony. "Hey, everybody!" Jim called into the house. "Come on out here! Kelley's going to burn his draft card!" To the huge amusement of Jim and his family, I took the card out into the Provenzas' driveway, got out my trusty Bic...and set that sucker aflame. Burning your draft card in 1970 would have gotten you tossed in jail, but by 1975 it was about as inflammatory an act (no pun intended) as saying “The south will rise again.”   My father not only changed his mind about the war, but as time went on, he changed his mind about Nixon. In fact, Richard Nixon accomplished something that I don’t think anyone else on this earth possibly could have: he turned my father into a Democrat, albeit for a short time. By 1974, with Watergate clearly about to become Nixon’s Waterloo, my father got so mad at Nixon that he went out and changed his voter registration to Democrat. He remained a Democrat for several years, in fact after his retirement from the Immigration Service, my father did a stint as an administrative assistant to a Democratic state senator in California. (That turned him back into a Republican.)   I had just finished my junior year of high school when the Watergate burglars broke in. Again, I watched TV news and read the papers now and then, so I knew what was going on in a general way, but I was too busy being a teenager to worry about it very much. In the summer of ’72 I was more interested in ogling Olga Korbut, the excruciatingly adorable little Soviet gymnast who was the darling of the Munich Olympics, than I was in anything I was seeing in the papers about Nixon or McGovern. (I signed up to do campaign work for Nixon that fall, but again, being a teenager won out: I think I only showed up at campaign HQ one time, then lost interest.) Come to think of it, the same was true of such issues as the energy crisis and the gas lines of 1974; by then I was using the family Chevrolet to attend junior college, but my dad was paying for all the gas: what did I care if it had just reached the outrageous price of 50 cents a gallon? (I pumped gas in high school for $1.50 an hour. At that time, gas cost about 32 cents a gallon. When I tell that story to today’s twentysomethings, their jaws drop at BOTH numbers.)   By 1976 I had finished community college and transferred to San Diego State University to do my upper-division studies. I loved history and wanted to make that my major subject, but I could see that my father was uncomfortable with my getting a liberal-arts degree. It was the Old Story of “What can you do with that?” Many of my classmates were struggling with the same dilemma: the Class of ’77 was loaded with Business Administration majors who would have preferred to be English majors but had to worry about finding a job. I had decided, early in college, not to major in English myself, though I had considered it. At 19, I allowed myself to be swayed by a purely romantic notion: I loved poetry and literature so much that I decided not to allow my love for these things to be poisoned by a lot of academic BS. Somehow I had the idea that a literary degree would take the fun out of reading Yeats, Shakespeare and Tolstoy, so I decided against it. History was a subject I also loved, but not with the level of passion I had for literature. Besides, history is all  about  scholarship: classrooms can’t hurt that.   Still, I had to face the Old Story, and so I struck a compromise with my dad and with myself. Since the age of 16 I had never wanted to be anything but a writer, so I decided that an acceptable halfway measure would be to double-major, in history and journalism. I entered the College of Liberal Arts to pursue a major in history, and then walked across campus to the College of Professional Studies to pursue a major in journalism. I had no notion of becoming a history professor; I simply liked the subject. After college, I figured, I could go to work as a reporter on a newspaper or magazine. What the heck, my 21-year-old self figured. It was all just time-serving anyway, until I managed to explode upon the literary scene with my first big novel. Yeah, right.   Setting aside the nonsense about big (or small) novels, little did I know that my decision to major in journalism had put me on a collision course with history, or at least with cultural trends. Talk about bad timing. And Nixon, appropriately enough, lay at the bottom of it all.   I made the decision about going for a journalism major during my junior year at State: 1976. The year of "Rocky."   But it was also the year of "All The President’s Men." The movie version of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s adventures as Washington Post reporters bringing down Richard Nixon hit the silver screen that year, with rugged Robert Redford and handsome young Dustin Hoffman as their nowhere-near-as-good-looking real-life counterparts. (Why does Hollywood always do this, by the way? One thinks also of unbearably-glamorous revolutionaries Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in "Reds." In real life, John Reed and Louise Bryant were a couple of two-baggers.)   Some contemporary observer of social trends in the mid-1970s remarked that at the moment in the film when Robert Redford bats his beautiful orbs inquisitively and utters the line, “Who’s Chuck Colson?” 250,000 college students immediately ran out and changed their majors. Suddenly, with "All The President’s Men," journalism became cool. Everybody wanted to be the hotshot investigative reporter who goes around pulling down the establishment. Little did any of them realize that this phenomenon, of two newspaper reporters taking on the President of the United States, was the ultimate one-shot deal: it had never happened before and in all likelihood will never happen again. Armies of nouveau journalism students who expected to graduate, go to work for the Washington Post and become the next Bob Woodward found themselves covering Rotary Club luncheons in Bayonne instead. But no matter. From the release of the film until the end of the decade and beyond, the nation’s journalism schools were chock full of wannabe Woodwards and Bernsteins, and I, who had no Watergatey pretensions at all, (remember, my plan was to become Scott Fitzgerald, not Bob Woodward) found myself standing in a field swamped by heavy traffic. Everybody and his dog wanted to be a reporter, and every newspaper opening in the country had 50 people (some still fighting pimples) lining up to interview for it.   Needless to say, it took me a long time to get my foot in any sort of door. In fact, it wasn’t until February, 1979, more than a year and a half after getting my B.A., that I managed to glom on to a tiny position with a tiny, independent news service in San Diego that was the very definition of “shoestring.” (In the meantime, I had worked at a series of minimum-wage jobs, including security guard and 7-Eleven clerk.) The County News Service of San Diego covered the city and county beats, and the courthouse, for subscriber weeklies countywide that did not have the resources to cover these beats for themselves.   How shoestring were we? The era was not only pre-Internet by more than a decade, but pre- computer  by maybe three or four years. I would cover a meeting of the County Board of Supervisors, then type out my stories on an ancient Smith-Corona portable. At the end of the day, whoever’s turn it was to do the mailing that week would gather everyone’s copy, determine how many copies needed to be made using a chart of our client list, then drive over to radio station KGB-FM, with whom we had a trade-off agreement: in return for tip service, they let us use their Xerox machine.   Once the copies had been made, the “mailer” then had to drive them over to the main post office (not a branch, that would slow things down) and drop them in the mail to our clients. (Yes, we ran a news service using “snail mail.”) We had complimentary subscriptions to all the client newspapers, and once a month we would all get together with pencils and rulers and go through the tear sheets, measuring in inches how much of our copy they had used. We then billed the clients $1.00 per column inch. Each reporter got to keep 60 cents on the dollar for whatever we managed to get into print. The other 40 cents were set aside for overhead, basically envelopes and postage. No by-line, and 60 cents a column inch: that was payday. (We had a joke amongst ourselves: “Welcome to County News Service: 60 cents an inch and all the pride you can swallow.”)   For the rest of that year, I went back and forth between home and downtown San Diego, by car, by moped and sometimes by bus, to put in eight-hour days for what was usually somewhere between $250 and $300 a month. To supplement my meager newspaper income, I went back to minimum-wage work as a part-time security guard, spending my Saturday and Sunday afternoons and evenings walking a beat at a local tuna cannery. My father, who initially threw up his hands in despair at my 60-cents-per-column-inch gig, went along with this: I think he understood that I viewed this as my last chance, at age 23, to get into the newspaper business, and if I were willing to work seven days a week to do it, that meant I was serious.   By December, (just about the time those Soviet tanks were rolling into Afghanistan) I managed to land my first real newspaper job, on The Imperial Valley Press, a daily newspaper of about 15,000 circulation in El Centro, California. The “Woodstein” crowd notwithstanding, I got the job through an acquaintance who covered the county beat for the now-defunct Escondido Times-Advocate, had worked on the Imperial Valley paper previously, and still knew the managing editor. That inside track helped, as did the fact that nobody in his right mind would want to live in the Imperial Valley, where the average high temperature between June and September is somewhere between 110 and 118. (For my European and Russian friends, that’s 43 to 47 Celsius.) But I wanted to be a journalist, so off I went.   And that’s where I was the night in 1980 when Reagan was elected: I was living in a one-bedroom apartment in El Centro, for which I was paying $180 a month rent out of the roughly $850 a month which was my full salary. (I started at $720, but the managing editor liked the cut of my jib, so he gave me a raise.)   And I wasn’t expecting a whole lot more, which is my whole point in telling this story.   My father, who turned 20 in 1934, spent the rest of his life expecting the Depression to come back and pounce on him again at any moment, and he lived his life accordingly. He set his sights low, seldom dared to dream, and even when he did dream, for example of buying a farm, he talked himself out of it. He insisted, sometimes loudly, that job security and the guarantee of a retirement pension were the highest things anyone had a right to hope for. He worked 30 years for the Border Patrol and the Immigration Service, retired and spent his dotage sitting on the front porch watching the world go by, boasting of the size of his retirement income, but inwardly seething with resentment, convinced that life had somehow cheated him.   My outlook at 24 wasn’t as extreme as my father’s at the same age, for a couple of good reasons. For one, as bad as they were, the 1970s were not the 1930s, and for another, I had had the advantage of four years of college, something my father never got.   Still, like my father, I had come of age expecting little. The Nixon-Ford-Carter years were conducive to that.   Reagan and his team did, in eight years, gradually manage to turn things around. The change didn’t come quickly, in fact 1982, the second year of Reagan’s first administration, was a severe recession year, one in which I had the experience of being unemployed—for me, the ‘70s seemed to be continuing. But we all know that economic upturns and downturns both tend to lag several years behind changes in economic policy: the positive effects of “Reaganomics” didn’t really start to bear fruit until nearly the end of his first term. His successor, George Herbert Walker Bush, continued Reagan's economic policies into the 1990s, ushering in an era of prosperity not seen for half a century. The Clintonistas tried to take the credit for the 1990s economic boom, but it was not theirs to take. They bashed the memory of Reagan’s administration while basking in the benefits of his economic legacy. (Later, Democrats tried to lay the blame for the 2000-2003 recession on George W. Bush, changing the subject when anyone happened to mention that it began in March, 2000, on Bill Clinton’s watch.)   The change in attitude between my generation and the one that followed it is hard to ignore. When I talk to twentysomethings, and even thirtysomethings, nowadays, I’m amazed at how high their expectations are. Babies born after 1970 have grown into adults who, I would not be at all surprised, scratch their heads in bewilderment at the willingness of Rocky Balboa to settle for second best in 1976. I was a federal employee from 1985 until 1999, and until I left the federal work force and went back to the private sector, I didn’t know what a corporate recruiter was. I’d never heard of one. Imagine my surprise when a corporate recruiter e-mailed me in 1999 and asked if I might be interested in a job writing for the marketing department of a custom software company. The idea that a company might hire people, and pay them salaries, simply to hire other people, was beyond anything in my experience. And yet when I talk to college students today, their expectation is that corporate recruiters will be looking for them upon graduation. Their expectation (happily unrealistic, even in today’s world) is that they’ll walk away from their college graduation ceremonies and be pulling down 75 thou a year the following week. In my first job after college, during the "Star Wars" summer of '77, I was making $2.60 an hour as a night watchman in a Ventura, California lemon packing plant.   Talk about a generation gap. The war babies and their parents didn’t see eye to eye over Vietnam, long hair, rock music and drugs. Now the generations may differ over rap, tattoos and body piercing, but I think there’s also a divergence on something fundamentally more important, namely, what they expect as regards the quality of life. I don’t have any children, but friends my own age who do are amused—-and sometimes understandably annoyed—-by the way their high school and college-age children seem to expect so much more coming out of the gate than we did. We ‘70s kids, for the most part, expected to start out humble and slow. I don’t say that to try and make us sound more virtuous than our progeny, it was simply a fact, a reflection of the era in which we grew up. Today’s college grads want it all, and they want it now. And they expect to get it, too.   It all came along too late for me, unfortunately. I’m getting close to 50, and the idea of even owning my own home is something I have only recently begun to think about. When I was young during the Carter years, interest rates stood at 21 percent. I assumed you had to have a huge pile of money to buy a house, and since I never raised a family, I never really thought I needed a house, so my thinking on that subject never changed. By contrast, I have a 26 year-old acquaintance who is aggressively buying and selling one house after another even as I write these words, claiming he’s going to be “the next Donald Trump, but a nice one.”   A few weeks ago I interviewed an 82 year-old World War II veteran, a man who had been at Normandy, for a newspaper story. While he poo-pooh’ed Tom Brokaw’s “Greatest Generation” applause for himself and his contemporaries, he nevertheless echoed Brokaw’s implied message about today’s young: “They have too much stuff and they got it too damn easy,” he said with genial scorn. Well, the grumblings of the old about how soft the young have it are themselves as old as the pyramids and then some, I’m sure.   But after interviewing this friendly, loquacious old vet, and realizing that it was people his grandchildren’s age that he was talking about, I surprised myself by realizing that my attitudes aren’t that much different from his. My 22 year-old nephew drives a teal 1994 Honda Civic, fully loaded and souped up for drag racing, (I hope the cops nail him) that his grandfather bought for him for $4,500. My niece, 21, has a late-model Saturn. The only time my father ever bought me a car, it was a ’72 Chevy Luv pickup that cost $1,300, and I had to pay him back. That same nephew, by the way, is talking about opening up his own business as soon as he finishes college. (At the rate he’s taking classes, this should be around 2023.) I saw a newspaper article a few days ago about students at an affluent high school in California whose parents reward them for getting good grades with Jeep Cherokees, Lexus sedans and the like.   Today’s kids have too damn much stuff, and they got it too easy.   Like it or not, Reagan lies behind all of this. When he was reshaping economic policy in the early 1980s, the lefty-liberal crowd alternately worked themselves into a state of high dudgeon over those mean old tax cuts, and when that didn’t convince the country that Reagan was evil, they beat their breasts and moaned about how this non-compassionate old grinch was taking money from the poor, unleashing the forces of greed, glorifying selfishness, etc. etc. Yes, this non-compassionate cowboy who didn’t love the poor was determined to change the warm, fuzzy, smiley-face policies that had given us 21 percent interest, 13 percent inflation and 10 percent unemployment. The bastard. Because Reagan was sworn in as president the year he was born, my nephew can now go around talking about opening up his own business when he finishes college.   Oh, and by the way, like many of his contemporaries, my nephew proudly sports a Che Guevara T-shirt. Times may change, and attitudes may change, but kids will always be kids; with the under-25 crowd, what feels good will always win out over what makes sense.   As for me, my editor at the newspaper, who is about the same age as me (and facing his fourth marriage) has his eye on a little fixer-upper over in National City. Three bedrooms, two baths. $350,000, as reasonable a price as you’re going to find in San Diego County these days. He thinks I should take the plunge, too. But I’m not taking that old fart’s word for anything. I think I’ll go and have a talk with my friend who’s planning to become the next Donald Trump. He’s 26, so I’m sure I can count on him to give me good, practical advice for the 2000’s.

						   In a newspaper column a few years ago, Andy Rooney wrote "I don't know anyone who is good with a computer who uses it for much of anything except being good with a computer.  They understand the technology of information retrieval, but they don't have much interest in the information.  I am vice-versa." 	 It was something I'd been trying to say for a long time, but was never able to put it quite that well.    It has seemed to me, since I bought my first PC about nine years ago, that in the midst of the so-called "computer revolution," we've not only lost sight of the forest for the trees, we're not even seeing the trees anymore because we've gotten so absorbed in the landscaping.   You don't hear computer weenies talking about the information they access on the Internet, but only about the slicko hardware and software they used to access it, and how they're all lined up and ready to buy the next generation of slicko stuff due out next week.    	 Dare I suggest that this is all really just another proof of the old saw that women have been throwing around for years, "Men never grow up, it’s just that their toys get more expensive?"     Dave Barry: "Guys like neat stuff, and by 'neat' I mean mechanical and unnecessarily complex."    Bingo.  This is why guys like my old friend Bill Barna, who works for Microsoft these days, can't stop buying more memory chips and Pentium upgrades and everything similar that he can get his hands on.  A computer is a really neat toy, and guys do like their toys.  And although women use computers too, they aren't quite as single-mindedly fixed upon them for their own sake.  They have other priorities.    Dave Barry again: "...a woman who would cheerfully use the same computer for fifty-three years will rearrange her furniture on an almost weekly basis, sometimes in the dead of night."    	 I am typing this on a computer, an IBM Pentium computer which I acquired a few years ago as part of the package that came with a home-study course in desktop publishing.  Since I bought my first PC, a Packard-Bell 486, way back in 1995, it has long since become "obsolete," in fact they stopped making 486's in the late 1990s.  Everything is getting faster and faster and cheaper and cheaper. My long-since obsolete 486 cost me $1,500 in 1995. An IBM like the one I'm using now can be purchased at a used computer store for about $300.    	 This is the world of "men and their toys" run gleefully amuck: computer hardware purchased in June will be "obsolete" by Christmas.   But I, for one, am not running out to buy a nuclear-powered laptop with racing stripes and then crate this IBM up for the junkyard  as some guys would.  Despite women's relentless generalizations about men, which are sanctioned and encouraged by the sniffy hypocrisy of political correctness, not ALL men are into computing for the sake of computing.   Witness Andy Rooney, myself or my one-time friend, pianist Jesus R. Araiza, who, when I once asked if he were planning to get a computer, replied with a snort, "A computer is just a very expensive pencil."   	 To a limited extent, he has a point.  I keep a computer around mainly for word-processing, and since my stone-age 486 served that function well enough, I didn't replace it until it went belly-up on me.  Until just the within last couple of years or so, I seldom used my on-line service for anything except e-mail.  I use it more now than I used to, because in my current line of work it's vital for research. But that brings us back to Andy Rooney's point: I have a limited understanding of the technology of information retrieval, as most of us do these days; it's a necessary part of modern life. But I remain with those who are more interested in the information.

						   An excerpt from Kelley's journal dated July 27, 2004:  Yesterday, for the first time in more than 30 years, I walked up and on to the grounds of Chula Vista High School.  I was on assignment to get a newspaper interview with my old homeroom teacher, Gary Chapman, who in the twilight of his career has been named principal at CVHS. Him, and also Wes Braddock, who has been tapped for the same job across town at Sweetwater High. Chapman has been in the Sweetwater Union High School District since 1969: 35 years. Braddock’s been around roughly half that long.  When I first ambled into Chapman's classroom in September, 1970, a pimply kid on the eve of his 15th birthday, he was a greenhorn teacher with one year of experience under his belt. Now he’s older and stouter, but he’s still Chapman: I noted the level of jocular locker-room repartee that went back and forth between him and his friend Braddock. Chapman was always a jock, and he’ll die a jock. When I was a kid, it caused friction between him and me, his perpetual gridiron-scented he-man swagger. Now I just find it amusing.  Chapman and I rode over to Sweetwater in his pickup truck, and I spent about an hour interviewing these two guys. I’ll file my story tomorrow morning, in time for this week’s edition.  I parked on K Street and just ambled up on to the campus. School was out for the day and there weren’t very many people around. There were the old familiar sights: the senior lawn, (open in my day, fenced, gated and locked now) the band room, the ramp leading up to the administration building, at the head of which my friend Dan Ramet, one-time long-hair, rock-and-roll drummer and god-knows where now, and I stood to have our pictures taken for the school paper in 1973. The photo was occasioned by our partnership writing articles about music for the  Spartan Spectrum , the campus newspaper whose moniker had been my suggestion in campuswide balloting during my sophomore year. It was my pleasure to learn, two or three years ago, that after all these years the name is still being used: my own tiny legacy to a school with which my relationship, when I was a student there, was ambivalent at best. But that's one of the funny things about nostalgia: it tends to knock irony flat on its ass.  I entered the corridor of the Administration building, which I do not think I had visited since graduation day, 6/15/73, although I do recall going back to Chula once, during my first year of college, at the request of my former speech coach, the late Jack Nolen, to help out at a speech tournament. (I was supposed to be a judge, but I ended up sorting evaluation slips instead.)  There were the musty old stairs leading up to the second floor, where I suffered Consumer Math with Mr. Oliver during my sophomore year, and English 11 at the hands of Mr. Harris in 1971-72.  There was the nurse’s office, where my best friend Randy Bendel and I used to hang out at lunch time. (Randy was killed in an automobile accident in 1977 at age 22. He was the second of his ill-starred family to go into Holy Cross Cemetery out in east San Diego. His younger sister Robin had preceded him by seven years, at the age of 14. Since Randy's death, his brother Fred and both of his parents have joined him and Robin there. The whole family had karma to burn, it would seem.)  There were the old counseling offices, now converted to other uses, where I was summoned in ’72 to be told that Mr. Bill Weed, the choir director, wanted me taken out of the choir (I sang bass) for my rotten attitude. (I got back in a month later, but in the interim was in Mr. Chapman’s psychology class.)  The open foyer that used to greet visitors in my day has been walled up and fitted with lockable doors—the legacy of Columbine and other changes in society since my youth. But I went in there and noticed, on the walls, two glass cases housing the Spartan Hall of Fame: a rogue’s gallery of distinguished grads. Needless to say, I’m not there, and neither is my lifelong pal, pianist extraordinaire and man-about-Manhattan Charles Berigan, (Class of '74) but Berigan’s old pal from Rotary Interact, Joe Schilling (also Class of ’74) is there, as is San Diego County Supervisor Greg Cox (Class of ’66) and numerous others.  But the distinguished grad whose middle-aged photo caught my eye, and set memory aflame, was a guy I never knew and think I only met once or twice: Bill Roush (Class of ’70.)  When I was a student at CVHS, Bill Roush’s photo hung on another wall, in another building, part of another rogue’s gallery. He had been ASB president during his senior year, and there his sullen, unsmiling senior picture hung among those of every other ASB president at CVHS, going back to the school’s founding in 1947. (If memory serves me, Chula’s first ASB president was some guy named Marvin Anderson. His was the only photo in which the subject was not wearing a bow tie, and he looked every bit as sullen as his successor from 22 years later.) I remember that distinct feature of Bill Roush’s senior picture: some teenagers smile in their senior pictures and some manage to look either serious or contemplative (I’ve liked to think, down all the years, that in my senior picture I looked contemplative.) Roush, in his senior picture, looked downright glum.  Overachievers will be overachievers, and although Bill Roush graduated the spring before I started at CVHS, I was aware that he went on to UCLA, and now that I have seen his (smiling, years later) color photo in the Spartan Hall of Fame, I know that he went on eventually to become a professor of chemistry at the University of Michigan.  But who is he to me? Well, it so happened that when I was a sophomore at CVHS, the year after Bill Roush graduated, I met and fell madly in love with a girl named Roberta Hauk (Class of ’71.) In those days I was capable being madly in love with three girls at a time. Anyway, the since-graduated-and-gone-off-to-UCLA Bill Roush was at that time Roberta’s steady boyfriend. (Roberta was one of those girls who simply  had  to be the girlfriend of the ASB president; it was a status symbol to be dating a Big Man On The Campus.) Also, as speech squad mentor David Hirsch (Class of ’71) explained to me one night at a motel in Claremont when he had accompanied the speech squad to an out-of-town tournament, he had seen other senior girls do precisely the same thing Roberta had done: claim a boy as their “steady” who had already gone off to college, thereby exempting themselves from senior-year dating without having to lose face because of it. It should therefore come as no surprise that when Roberta graduated in 1971 and went off to UCLA herself, the first thing she did was dump Bill Roush like a sack of overripe turnips.  All of this would have mattered not one whit to me but for one thing: I was crazy about Roberta. But Bill was a hard guy to be jealous of. He was a shadowy figure for one thing, offstage all the time. The first time I saw him, at a festival of silent comedy films in the high school gym during the spring of my sophomore year, all I saw was the back of his head (and Roberta hugging and kissing him.) Later I saw him once or twice at Roberta’s house. But he was sullen, unsocial, uncommunicative. He apparently just wanted to be alone with Roberta and didn’t want anyone else around. Eventually she began using this against him, when she was setting the stage for his dumping. And he could see the way things were going: the next time I saw him at Roberta’s house, he made an attempt to be friendly. But it was too late. His fate was sealed. Roberta moved on to other boyfriends, eventually marrying some guy named John Howard circa 1976, and that’s where she disappeared from my radar screen. I’ve never heard tale nor trace of her again. Howard Freelove, (Class of ’71) my friend down in the Tia Juana River Valley, told me that he had seen her at their 30-year reunion in 2001, but didn’t get a phone number or an address, so he doesn’t know where she’s living these days, with whom, or what she’s doing.  After this all-too-literal plod down memory lane, I fully expected to have that awful recurring dream where I’m back in high school again, being summoned by the bell to face math, science and social studies, not to mention that ghastly regimentation all the livelong day that made high school such a trial for me. But, whatever her reasons, Mnemosyne decided to spare me that. And so to breakfast.

						   This morning, after my seven a.m. reverie over Harold Bloom’s anthology of poetry in English, (A.E. Housman, Wilfred Owen, Edward Thomas, E.A. Robinson, Stephen Crane and Trumbull Stickney, leading up to Robert Frost, an old friend whom I will revisit tomorrow) I was sufficiently conscience-stung to go and dig up an old unfinished project: “8:45 and Elsewhere,” the cycle of poems I began in the fall of 2001 as a response to the Sept. 11 attacks. It has been hanging fire since around New Year’s Day of 2002.  I’d hit the worst roadblock in all my years of writing poetry: Lyric XIV hung unfinished for lack of a last verse. I wanted a socko ending and could not come up with one, and thus has the poem hung for more than two and a half years.  I took the coward’s way out: to hell with socko endings. I rounded it out with a dying fall and then e-mailed the whole mess to Lucia.  It actually came rather quickly when it came. I pulled up the poem and sat here, stroking my chin and tinkering with the text on the computer screen for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes (while Handel’s “Water Music” played on the Windows Media Player) before an idea formed itself of how I could construct a final verse to the poem, and once I had that, the working-out with pen and paper took scarcely five minutes. I wrote the last line first and went backwards.  I have advanced at least one theory about why I have written practically no poetry in the past three years. The “no muse” theory seems to stand up against the evidence: looking back, it’s pretty clear that when there’s no woman in my life, as is the case now and has been for three years, I write nothing. Of course that’s an oversimplification, because some women have inspired me to write poetry while others have not. "Consuelo" yes, Jamie, no. Nadya, absolutely; my wife, absolutely not. Diane yes, (despite being fundamentally a moron) Tatiana no (despite being Russian.)  But there’s been something else at work besides lack of erotic fuel. Lassitude, surely: the old business of why bother when you have no audience to write for? But if you really wanted to do it, you’d do it anyway, so that’s really just an excuse. No, I think there’s been some measure of the old adage about the centipede involved. The centipede was asked which leg he moved first when he started to walk, and was thus paralyzed. If he had to think about it, he couldn’t do it. I’ve just thought too much about it.  And there’s a "villain" in the piece: Garrison Keillor.  Yes, Garrison Keillor, the middle-brow would-be popularizer of poetry who can be heard spouting it on NPR every morning for about five minutes. In one of his books, (I forget which) he has a funny anecdote about an adolescent wannabe poet who gets up every summer morning and, “after reading a few pages of Walt Whitman to prime the pump,” gets going. Ha-ha. Although I haven’t done anything quite that egregious since I was young myself, I will confess that quite often it’s been the case that I’ll get started on a poem after reading someone else’s poetry.  But you see the problem here, don’t you? Keillor made a joke of it, and I didn’t want to be part of a joke. But that’s stupid. I don’t have any particular respect for Garrison Keillor. He’s a buffoon, a midwesterner who successfully transplanted himself to New York City and, proud of that accomplishment, now dines out on making fun of the hicks back home who didn’t manage to become a “sophisticate” like he did. Am I to be influenced by Garrison "Yukking-up-his-sleeve-at-his-own-origins" Keillor, who tries to gain intellectual respectability by publishing an anthology of middle-brow verse with the aw-shucks title “Good Poems?” No. I am to be influenced by Harold Bloom, who publishes a magnificent anthology called “The Best Poems of the English Language,” which I have been reading, cover-toward-cover, for more than a month, and am now on page 817, about to revisit Robert Frost, author of one of my favorite poems in all the world, but one which I would and will never consciously imitate: “Come In.” (Josef Brodski’s brilliant exegesis of this poem, published some 10 years ago in  The New Yorker , is something that I think should be dropped from airplanes.) I can assure Garrison Keillor that he will find nothing of Robert Frost, but perhaps a tiny dash of Whitman, in my “8:45 and Elsewhere” (which he’ll never see in any case.) But what poet since the 1890s has been able to avoid Whitman entirely? He’s like the boulder in the road: you may walk around it, but there’s no not noticing it. Slavish imitation and influence are not the same thing, in fact “influence” is one of the mysteries that makes poetry exciting. So I’ll soldier on, despite Garrison Keillor’s funny little joke about priming the pump. For the record, the dozen or so poems I read this morning while having my coffee had no influence that I can see on the final stanza of Lyric XIV. Perhaps years after I’m dead, some Internet poetry expert will dispute that. In the words of our president, bring it on.

						   "8:45 and Elsewhere" is a cycle of 14 poems that Kelley wrote, mostly during the fall of 2001. What they are "about" may be open to interpretation, but they were occasioned by the September 11 terrorist attacks. Call them Kelley's personal response to that unthinkable morning.    8:45 and Elsewhere a Journal Autumn, 2001    I  These twilit evenings, the twilight’s intense: Looking out over the parking lot’s frown, You feel beyond the trees a humming of sky Not like bees, but like a whisper of intent In a language that you can’t quite place. Where is the morning when that certainty of sky, So blue that its blueness could not be imagined, Glimpsed before a flutter of pigeons flew off, Defined Tuesday morning, a somnolent clock? All of those Tuesdays have been defaced: Long shadows gap-tooth the grass near the fence.  II  The doings of the sun haunted years Of our long, nervous childhood, When the radio antennas Cranked, clawing at the sky; The songs that dreaded the sun Never dreamed a dread mundane Could ignite a billion fears.  Late in the afternoon, As the talking heads buzzed on, My thumb spoke up for silence. A drive down to the reservoir Seemed like the thing to do. Ducks moved in rippling water, Small fishes swam in synchro, The quiet itself spoke eloquently Of smoke on three horizons: The lake fire-danced with sun.  Then bright night, humming loud: White noise drowned out the stars; Sense came down with the cities. Monday’s clear-text: Tuesday’s garble. In half a million tons there smoked Remnants of a collective reach, 100-plus channels of helplessness Adding speechlessness to speech. Groping for words from long ago, I think of the belly of a cloud.  The view from the Narrows: Yellow fog drifts over the battery, Then, on the streets of Brooklyn A noisome odor leers. Our job now is to reclaim daylight; Never mind night: that remains The mystery it will always be. But in the afternoon on Canal Street, Language attemped to regroup, Hushed, multi-tongued, in sorrow.  Since Time’s murderous birth, Whose echo we can still make out, It’s been obvious to a handful Just what our inheritance is, And now it’s come to consciousness, Not like the sun, but like nonsense Amplified a billion times. This is the search for keys in a downpour, Thought hindered by hammering rain, One more questioning of the earth.  III  A full moon on Halloween. Won’t be another for 19 years. But it shows up this year, A stage-prop seeking a stage. Yes, there’s some movement On the streets: little shadows, Clutching bags, shepherded As usual by chatting adults With flashlights, And I hurry Home through the dark, As the wind obligingly Scrapes the street with the dry leaves It shepherds along, Then break out the candy, Pour it in a bowl, and set it By the door to wait. 8:15. Everyone’s gone now; My doorbell’s only rung once— The boy next door: his parents trust me—so the candy’s poured Back into the bag, and tomorrow The crowd at the office Will dispose of it, I’m sure. Now, channel-surfing takes me past The World Series, The Munsters And chattering of anthrax. A full moon on Halloween. Won’t be another for 19 years.  IV  The gyroscope spinning in the radio tried to right itself As you drove along through traffic this afternoon: The lead story, when the news came on at two, Was the government’s done deal with Microsoft. Ah, for a moment there it was old times again: Judges sternly judging, lawyers prevaricating, the prating press. But then the voice moved on to other business: The FBI picked up some telephone calls, And the National Guard was patrolling bridges in California. About that time, the left-turn signal said it was all right to go, And as you pulled back into the office parking lot, You remembered a long-ago collision on the Oakland Bay bridge. The Maverick was totaled; beyond that it was no big deal.  V The Nostradamus industry Has set up shop again. He comes and goes in grocery stores: You see him now and then.  But now he’s on the world circuit Where you can’t see his eyes, And someone’s claiming he foresaw Fire, raining from the skies.  Fire’s the perfect metaphor For what we encounter next, Before someone corroborates The words of the old text.  Doom brushfires its way around The corridors of space As quickly as the Internet Can make a rumor race.  And by the time that common sense Finally regains the floor, Someone claims Old Scratch himself Appeared amidst the roar.  It’s true that when things fall apart And the center doesn’t hold, We often go seek order in The awesome and the old.  But must we, even though we must Desperately search for clues, So lose our heads we start to trust In the  Weekly World News ?  VI  One more time, As so often before, Autumn can’t seem To make up its mind. One morning the glass Has to be scraped Before you can move, Then you find yourself Impatiently peeling An unneeded parka As you step outside.  I once wrote of Indian summer, That it seemed as if Time’s teeth were on edge. How much truer Does that seem now. Less irony around These days (so they say), But I’m not so sure. These Indian summer mornings Are too much the one There’s no escaping, That when the crackle Of strange blue-sky Thunder tore a jagged hole In the face of every clock, And everything froze Into frames that burn With each rewinding, And don’t fade, but grow Sharper with recall, Like the heartbreak That a lover keeps Re-playing, and re-playing.  One wishes the fall Would get on with it, Turn that last key, Clear irony from the air, And bring on the certainties Of winter, whose shades Are a more fitting mirror Of this collective moment. The poets who love Autumn leaves, yes, They’ll be here again, And we’ll be glad, But the time isn’t now. I feel, walking along In the blue afternoon With the trees their annual Shout of orange, yellow And red, that this isn’t The time for bright autumn: The thrush music, The dusk outside, Oddly enough, Are holding us back From burying our dead.  VII   Architecture is an act of optimism.  --The New York Times  One Sunday evening in Paris June, Sprawling on a stone bench, half-drunk, (Beer and jet-lag working in tandem) I ogled the west font of Notre Dame And thought...nothing. Sometimes it’s best Just to take a sublime moment for granted, And I was too tired to think in any case. This I once heard said about a great cathedral: That it was conceived as a smile. If it faced the sunset, seeking its own end, Well, that was only part of the scheme of things, And just one more reason to be glad. These also were begun and finished With a smile, though of a different kind: Not arrogance, no, but a confidence That was not common in that era. They arose against a racket so intense That some wondered if it would ever subside. But it did, and on we went, safe in the knowledge Of who our friends and enemies were. And now Notre Dame and that cloudy sunset Lie across a space that in all likelihood Will never again be crossed: the beer-haze Of that summer night gave way in turn To the morning no amount of caffeine Could make sense of, or liquor dull the edge, And in fact, as I watched the split-screen (live) The moment the west font awaited came to mind, And wasn’t quite so easily dismissed As one might normally have expected. It was that kind of morning, As it had been that kind of night.  VIII  In every film I’ve ever seen That was worth seeing More than once, There comes a defining Moment: Bogey catches Bergman’s tear as it falls; Henry Fonda heaves The captain’s palm tree Over the side; Gable, eyes cocked Like pistols, freezeframed Forever, resolutely Doesn’t give a damn; Newman and Redford, Plunging 100 feet Into swirling water To the cry of “Ah, shiiiiiiit!” But the movie moment That keeps playing back These dew-wet mornings Is that flock of pigeons. Yes, those pigeons, Those black-and-white  Fail-Safe  pigeons, (Fonda again, ’64) Fluttering en masse Into New York Morning sky, Like the clattering, Rippling-down timetables In the older airports, Those venetian blinds of Arrival and departure. The pigeons Last a second or two, And then a fusillade Of frozen city sights Leaves you on your own With the blow-back in the mind That you know comes next. Clearer than the implied Soviet missile following Is this: in full Color, (reality doesn’t Usually bother with The touch of Black-and-white) At 8:44:52, somewhere In lower Manhattan, A flock of pigeons Scrambled for the sky, And kept on going, But didn’t fade to black.    IX  An Airbus went down in Rockaway last week. Horror was called for and duly received, But also a collective breath-holding: The stock market nose-dived, and once again We took up our spots to watch CNN And wait for the verdict. Hours went by And as Dominican families wept, (The doomed jet was Santo Domingo-bound) A more general dread filled the quiet. The two flight recorders were quickly found, And the NTSB sent out the word: “Mechanical failure most likely cause.” So. 62 days proved to be too soon. The Dow-Jones took off, screaming for the moon.    X  The turkey carcass is a skeletal wreck, (“My fowl was soupbones,” the poet wrote, Conjuring a nightmare of another sort) And Macy’s parade having echoed away, --Uneventful, thank God, as we secretly say— Cable TV has wasted no time In trotting out the classics it no doubt hopes Will put everyone in a shopping mood. So, as the soap-bubbles tick in the sink, We settle down, sated, not full, as we say, And TNT dishes up  Home Alone , The Christmas number about the little boy Left behind by his family, besieged by burglars, Who outwits the bad guys and makes them pay. Outside, traffic is sparse on the road: A taxi lurches past, and an SUV Whose blackened windows flash, anonymous Under the glance of a gas-station awning As inside, a Pakistani immigrant counts change, And two kids, one with a ring in his nose, Skulk to the counter to buy frozen burritos, Skin slightly green in commercial light. The turkey is ravaged. It’s Thanksgiving night. The paper still lies on the lawn from this morning, An ignored intruder from ordinary time Bound to re-assert itself come tomorrow. But for now, plastic-bagged, it patiently waits, With everything it promises to contain, For when someone stoops, dew soaking their shoes, On the way to the car, in a ritual As automatic, if not quite as dread-free On this blue-sky morning as it was on that. Meanwhile, we lean back, not full as we say, And laugh in a circle one more time At the little boy, besieged by burglars, Who outwits the bad guys and makes them pay.     XI  The armchair in the corner keeps its back to the window. Outside, Indian summer presses on, and on. Lately, it might have been the storied place Where one looking quietly toward the tall bookcase Contemplated those big events that were none of his doing Or concern; the undusted TV screen, And the spiderweb up near the ceiling Were artifacts of an afternoon long and bemused. The impression still visible could have been any back, Someone watching, barely moving, outrage beyond thought, Wondering as the carping and shouting went on Not so much about them, but of things closer to home, And then, with a stretch and a yawn perhaps, A reminder to remember to take a glance At how the 401(k) might be performing, And to drop off the car on the way in next morning. But now the TV screen, dusted off, has hummed to life, And an old man in a peaked cap is quietly recalling A horribly unquiet moment, 60 years ago, When all eyes were suddenly and cruelly forced outward, And as he’s interviewed, under blue morning sky, The editing cuts to that all-too-familiar piece of film: The teetering tower, black smoke, Arizona listing, Outrage ripping the skin off a long and troubled sleep. (I had a neighbor who was on one of those ships; He dove into the harbor, swam as fast as he could, Eventually came to a sewer pipe, and swam on ahead: “I wasn’t going to stop until I came to an asshole,” he said.) The old man in the peaked cap is magnanimous: “There’s no comparison. It was our job to be in harm’s way.” This is traditionally the time of year when demons come visit, And it might be argued once again that our grandparents Weren’t quite the fools we liked to think they were: Suddenly, the gathering and the pressure to be “excessive” Seems to make a kind of sense: weeks ago we were told Of a sudden surge in “hooking up” and dessert consumption, And now, huddling again in the early and abrupt dark, The only thing differentiating this December from last Is a general nervous pulse-checking, an extra glance Where one glance would have been plenty before. The armchair, its back to the window, faces the door. The spider web near the ceiling has been cleared away. Someone may have just left, and may be returning soon, But whoever was here a year ago has left for good.  XII  Jogging under the aegis of a murder of crows, You recall the courier who survived two plane crashes Back when we took it for granted that such things were Accidents. The white envelope atop the dresser Has been looming there for weeks; louring, one might say, Like the ceiling, or this December sky. You know what’s inside, having examined it repeatedly. Banal as winter daylight, computer-spat, number-riddled, Perforated along one edge, subject to conditions of contract, The sort of threat you would never perceive as such In other times. You who were never superstititous a day In your life, are now amazed to notice things You never would have bothered to notice before: Baltimore/Washington is harmless enough a POD, But did the plane-change have to be Houston George Bush? (And is this the sort of thing, you ask in quiet alarm, That such as they would notice in plotting their next move?) The obligatory annual homing forces a crisis: Will you, when the chips are down, actually find the courage To go ahead with rituals as you’re being urged to do, And heed the pressure from your family to fly west, Just as you did last year without thinking twice? Out there, the table is set and the kitchen warmly illuminated, Like the tree that confronts the dining room window, Smiling at the street, as it has every year since Vietnam. But you wish, in ordinary time like you never did before, That the tesseract which you remember from great childhood Could become real long enough to swoosh you through this. A dozen time-zones and two satellite-skips away, They’re clearing out caves, chasing shadows across borders, While closer to home, the old music makes a game attempt To play again, and the most risible of the doomsayers Seem for now to be those discussing WalMart’s bottom line. Still, you clamp down the hatchback over your carry-on With a bit more queasiness than when air was more benign. Even now, the red sign proclaims no satellite parking. The Gold Lot’s where you go, stacked out in the weeds. Then the packed bus, lurching every foot or two, inching, And in the tension that accompanies the tightness Of clamping your carry-on between your knees, You want to reach over and smack the old lady, three down Yammering into a cellular phone for all to hear. Once you’ve run the bottlenecked gauntlet out of hell, Bossy six-dollar-an-hour help shouting this way and that, (“A little authority is a wonderful thing,” grumbles one victim) You slip into the gateside men’s room for a slug of resolve, Edgy enough to curse when the stall latch resists closing, Then, facing the bowl standing up, self-conscious, afraid, You see where someone’s pencilled a message in the grouting: “There is life after September 11—move on.” One more swallow and it’s there: the backbone to face Jet-blast mobilizing the stroll of the tarmac crows.  XIII  Gathering around and among lights Scattering, doomed: What better return of that familiar Nesting, solsticial light Could possibly be imagined for now? But there it is: only days after We’ve done it all one more time, The glistening ham taken Crackling from the oven, The family showing up Just late enough to be annoying, Astaire and Crosby dancing across The flickering screen in black-and-white, Bing putting down his pipe to sing  White Christmas,  his hands Fluttering over the keyboard as if Trying to shake drops of water From his fingernails, The menfolk sharing a shot of Glenfiddich Before the table, (always reminiscent Of that awful scene in Joyce) The circling of chairs, then the clearing-away Of all that multicolored, crinkling Paper and ribbon, stuffed efficiently Into a Glad green trash bag For the intrusion of Wednesday morning, Comes this. It breaks, at six O’clock, Upon a string of open-ended triumphs That may or may not (no one seems sure) Lead to anything like An unqualified conclusion, That the universe may indeed be eternal, But it’s beginning to look like we’re not. The number-crunchers, re-writing The playbook of endgame one more time, Now say the expansion may Go on forever, picking up speed, Not slowing down, (their last good guess) Until, at some time, ten To the string-your-zeroes-here moment From now, There’ll be nothing but a darkness, Sublime or not, it makes no difference, As there will be no eyes, evolved or not To look upon it and find it sublime. The object of our mammoth quest Has skedaddled into the hills; Reassuring voices say The future and the answer will be found, But the heavens as always Have nothing to add, As they had nothing to add All those other times either, And what kind of maniac Would be fool enough To think they had? This dead-in-four-billion-years Chunk of ground My fraying Nikes press against As I haul the Glad sack down the driveway, The spiked eggnog still swimming, Fatty and comforting in my blood, Is going with its progenitor, Which just dropped down redly Behind the eucalyptus trees, As symmetrical shenanigans At the galaxy’s core, Patiently, unhurriedly And without purpose, Go about mapping their final score, A new alphabet For all the holy books ever written.      XIV  A quarter past nine: the mirror sheen Shimmers where the candle gutters. New Year’s Eve, and I settle back Unpacked, swirl the cubes (they clink) And as cable TV once again utters Those commonplaces we hear each year, I join in progress an old favorite: Rod Taylor in  The Time Machine.   I saw it first when I was a boy: A Saturday afternoon in ‘62: Kids crowded into the school Cafeteria to sit on wooden benches, And marvel, as daylight poked the corners, And the old projector rattled, threatening, At the rickety screen, flanked by the flags Of states none would ever destroy.  Science fiction with its cautionary eye: Oh, he learns a lesson all right, Fast-forwards to high-tech horror, Then dogs on to another kind, Careening through a night of night Toward Weena, and those gargoyles Gnawing on the bones of the innocent Who never bothered asking why.  That world, we know, was where they believed. That’s the joke we’re supposed to get tonight. Complacent in their overstuffed chairs, They ask friendly questions of the poor soul; Of course we feel it’s proper and right For the smugness to be blown off their clocks. Okay, he oversteps himself like Phaeton, But in the end, gets time’s reprieve.  There will be no snowfall tonight. Winter’s staying away with a will When it’s most called-for. Socking over The kitchen tiles to fix another drink, Rounding out a season well-defiled And crying to be buried in something, I finger-spread the slats and look up: Quietly insolent, Orion’s bright.  Wheels are turning, you’d like to think. (Or would that really be such a good thing?) Two years ago, at 1000 mph, What passed for the millennium came in. Around that world a knife-edge flew: Towers exploded and rivers burned, But the real catastrophe stayed its hand. No round-number tonight, just this drink.  There are no firecrackers to be heard As AMC cuts to a commercial break: Some pitchman or woman for Dell Around the corner is selling speed. But it seems we have too much already, As my cheap Lorus hums the chapters on, And I, befuddled under Orion’s sword, Stand swirling cubes, waiting for a word.  2001-2004

						   An American wandering across his own country...what more archetypal image is there in our national consciousness? It's Kelley's feeling that every American should cross the United States at least once by some conveyance other than air.  Hopefully, however, the circumstances of their crossing will be better than those of the one Kelley made in the early spring of 2003.  Twice-unemployed in 2002, by the following winter, Kelley's luck had run out, as well as his unemployment checks. Unable to find employment in the suburban Washington, D.C. area where he was living at the time, Kelley accepted an invitation from his half-sister in Reno, Nevada to clear the decks, load up his car and come back out west.  So he did that, jettissoning along the way a library of more than a thousand books, records and CDs collected over half a lifetime, (donated to the local library) and an apartment full of furniture (Salvation Army.) On March 27, 2003 Kelley emptied out and cleaned the apartment, turned in the key, spent that night with a friend in Arlington, Va. and the next morning was on the road.  Over the next two months, he would gradually make his way from suburban Washington, D.C. back to his family's ancestral home on the west coast, with a two-month stopover in Reno, Nevada on the way.  These are the notes he kept on the journey. The "Blue Shoe" referred to in the text was Kelley's car, a 1990 Geo Storm that served him well from the moment he bought it in Springfield, Va. in 1994 until the moment he gave it away in Chula Vista, Calif. some nine years later, at the tail end of the extended journey described in these notes.     March 29, 2003       Kansas City, Kansas   My westward trek from six months’ unemployment to its continuation elsewhere began yesterday morning.  On Thursday, (3/27) I cleaned out my apartment in Silver Spring, continuing to throw things away even as I was making final trips to the storage facility in Wheaton where about 1,000 lbs. of my things will now sit until further notice.  Spent my last night in the D.C. area at Karen Winterbottom’s place. Karen served a supper of broiled salmon with pasta and salad, and I met her son Raymond, whose situation at age 31 isn’t so much different from mine. He was living in Chicago, but his professional and personal lives both jumped the tracks, and he’s now living with his mother in Arlington. looking for a job. In my cups after supper, I lost to him at Trivial Pursuit.  Left Karen’s place Friday morning at about 9:30. In eight hours I drove 500 miles, and by 7:30 was cruising through a blinding, cold rainstorm back into Indianapolis, a city which I swore less than a month ago that I never wanted to see again. I had intended to route myself around Indy and take I-80 across northern Indiana and Chicago and across Iowa. But Karen’s son persuaded me that it would make more sense to take I-68 to I-70 and avoid the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-80, both of which are toll roads. “You’ll save $30 in tolls,” he said. Since I’d decided to take Ray’s advice and go the I-70 route, which would take me through Indianapolis anyway, I decided I would try to look up Nancy, my little friend from the front desk of the Holiday Inn Southeast in Indy during my ill-fated stay there last month when I attended that horrific truck driving school. I thought I’d see if she could put me up for the night and save me the fifty bucks that a motel room would cost. On the phone a couple of weeks ago, she said she’d be glad to.  I found her, now working at a different Holiday Inn, the one in Greenfield, just east of town. I went there and waited around for her 11 p.m. quitting time, which became midnight when her relief came in late. To pass the time, I drank beer and ate fish n’ chips at a nearby Appleby’s, and watched  The Golden Girls  on cable TV in the hotel lobby. By midnight I was tired enough to begin wondering if it wouldn’t have been simpler and more pleasant to just forget about saving fifty bucks and check into a motel somewhere and forget about staying at Nancy’s place. As it turned out, that might not have been a bad idea.  We left at midnight, in a cold rain, and I followed her back to her house, a rat’s nest of trash and clutter in the midst of which her daughter was sleeping on the couch in front of a 52-inch TV set with her boyfriend. Nancy and I went upstairs, and even though it was now 12:30 a.m. and she had to get up at 6:00, (which meant I did too) she proceeded to watch some idiotic country-music awards show on TV, so I had to watch it too. I was restless for the road despite fatigue and only slept a couple of hours, and so was still dead-tired when Nancy’s kitschy alarm clock began an electronic cock-a-doodle-doo at 6:05. But it was definitely time to get moving.  After a stop at McDonald’s for coffee, she left for work and I hit the road. I took 465 East back to 70 and struck out in a westerly direction. Poring over a road map last night in the Holiday Inn lobby, I decided to just make I-70 my home for the next couple of days. It goes all the way to central Utah, and it runs through Denver, a city I would like to see, or at least stop at on my way west (yes, my readings of Jack Kerouac did influence that decision.) So this morning I took I-70 from Indianapolis through Terre Haute and across the state line into Illinois, where I had to set my watch back.  Central Illinois was pretty much what I expected: an endless panorama of flat farmland, barns, grain elevators, farmhouses and more of the same. A radio station from one of the smaller towns amused me by including local obituaries in the news.  By 11:00 a.m. I had crossed the Missouri River and entered St. Louis. I drove right past the giant arch, the “Gateway to the West,” St. Louis' most recognizable landmark, which faces east on the western bank of the Missouri. By this time I was listening to a St. Louis jazz station, and the landscape shifted abruptly from agrarian vistas to towns and cities, some of which had curious names: Pine Lawn, Kingdom City, Odessa. Kansas City was my objective, 500 miles seeming a reasonable distance to make the day’s goal when you’re not especially in a hurry and in any case have only had a couple of hours’ sleep.  But what with having set my watch on Central Time earlier, I’d picked up an hour, and when I reached Kansas City it was only about 2:00 p.m., which seemed kind of early to be stopping, but I was tired, and since I’m not humping any particular deadline, I decided to give myself a breather. I cruised through Kansas City, keeping an eye open for a motel that didn’t look too seedy, and the next thing I knew I had crossed the river into Kansas. I checked into this place, the American Motel, which has a red-white-and-blue motif and is reasonably cheap and clean. Bathed, changed clothes, had a sandwich and a beer, took a nap.  Tomorrow’s objective is Denver, which according to last night’s road map lies exactly 608 miles west of Kansas City. The Blue Shoe, with 132,000 miles on her, has performed well so far. As of yesterday morning when I crossed from Virginia into Maryland, I have driven 1,157 miles. Despite the pluck that the Shoe has shown so far, and despite her meanderings up and down the east coast and along the Autobahn in Germany, she has never encountered anything like the Rocky Mountains. I wonder how she’ll do.   March 30       Denver   Well, eastern Colorado was a big disappointment.  After leaving Kansas City at 8:45 this morning, I spent the next 6 1⁄2 hours getting from one end of Kansas to the other, finally crossing into Colorado at 3:15 p.m. (and turning my watch back again, now to Mountain Time.)  Kansas was the dullest landscape I have ever seen in all my days, basically 450 miles of nothing to look at. Scary, too, because unlike Illinois and Missouri, where there was another gas station or another town every few miles, Kansas features vast stretches of distance, mile after mile, in which there is nothing, and I mean nothing, outside of farms, grain elevators and trackless waste. I was so afraid of running out of gas, (the Shoe only holds ten gallons) that between Kansas City and Limon, Colorado, I stopped and topped off the tank three times.  Breakfast was Chinese food leftover from last night in Kansas City, eaten at one of these refueling stops somewhere between Topeka and Abilene. Lunch was a tuna sandwich and coffee at my last refueling stop in Limon, about 90 minutes east of Denver.  Geographic serendipity: we non-Coloradans, whose acquaintance with the Rocky Mountain State derives chiefly from the John Denver songs we’ve heard on Boomer-102 FM, expect the entire state to look like a Coors ad. Nope: eastern Colorado is essentially a continuation of Kansas, albeit one that continues a long, slow climb begun somewhere in those trackless wastes that took up much of my day. In fact, eastern Colorado continues to look like Kansas until you’re about an hour from Denver, and the rise in elevation is so gradual that you don’t even notice you’re climbing. Once on the Colorado side of the state line, I cruised through a tiny town called Arriba, and when I saw the sign that read, “Welcome to Arriba, elevation 5,228 feet,” I couldn’t believe it. “You can’t be serious,” I thought. “Here I’ve been driving through nothing but flat farmland all day, and now suddenly I’m up over 5,000 feet? When did that happen?”  Closer to Denver, the topography began to resemble the Laguna Mountains of eastern San Diego County that I’m familiar with, up around Julian: brown, rolling hills, scrub, a few patches of snow from last week’s big snowstorm. Not until you have almost arrived in Denver itself do you see actual mountains on the horizon.  Denver itself lies on a flat plain at the foot of those mountains and obviously marks the place where eastern Colorado ends.  Knowing nothing of Denver, but noticing as I came in on I-70 West that Peoria Avenue seemed to be “the motel strip,” I pulled off there and checked into the Super 8, sticking to my budget. But this is obviously a cheesy part of town, and if I had noticed before checking in that the motel is only half a block from the railroad tracks, I probably would have cruised on—I’m going to be listening to those trains all night. But I’m checked in now, so to hell with it: I have whiskey.  Today I drove about 600 miles once again, in about nine hours, fifteen minutes, with two brief stops for eating. I have driven 1,756 miles since Friday morning. Called both Lucia and Karen to let them know I had gotten as far as Denver; last night I called my half-sister Madelon and her husband Bill in Reno, my destination, to let them know I’d gotten as far as Kansas City. Madelon wasn’t home, but I talked with Bill for a few minutes. He reminded me that I’m not in a hurry, and advised me, should I run into bad weather, to just “pull off the road and wait.” But so far, the only bad weather I’ve seen was in Indiana. Yesterday in Illinois and Missouri it was chilly and windy, and once or twice between St. Louis and Kansas City a few snowflakes blew around, but nothing that I could really call bad weather. Here in Denver, it’s warm enough this evening to walk around in just a T-shirt.  Tomorrow I’ll try to reach Salt Lake City.   March 31       Midvale, Utah, just outside Salt Lake City   Drove 623 miles today, including a few miles of “backtracking” when I overshot Salt Lake City while looking around for a motel and had to turn around and come back down I-15 a few miles to the suburbs. Still watching my coins, I checked into Motel 6.  I was on the road today for almost 11 hours. Pulled out of Denver about 8:15 a.m. and pulled up to this motel at 7 p.m. The Rocky Mountains slowed me down (yes, the Blue Shoe, with close to 133,000 miles on her, made it over the Rockies!) as did some mountainous terrain in east-central Utah between Green River and Salina. Also, I drove about 100 miles farther west than I need have. I stayed on the Interstate, only to discover that I could have cut north directly to Salt Lake City on a state two-lane at Green River.  This in fact is what I did do at Salina, on the advice of a cashier at a gas station, rather than push on for another 55 miles to the junction of I-70 and I-15.  The Rocky Mountains, dappled with snow from recent storms which, according to the Denver radio stations, were the heaviest since 1913, were breathtaking, or I should say would have been if I hadn’t had to concentrate most of my attention on driving.  Still, I did succumb to Lynn and Nadya’s gentle pressure: both had urged me to take pictures, so I stopped at a 7-Eleven store on the way out of Denver and bought a roll of film for my camera. I did stop to snap a few pictures while crossing the Rockies, and also a few times while traversing Utah, to photograph the moonlike desolation of eastern Utah and the mountain vistas that greet you as you get closer to Salt Lake and Provo. Since I was driving  past  these mountains rather than  through  them, it was easier to appreciate their snow-capped majesty.  Utah is as strikingly diverse in its topography as is California. At 2:00 you’re looking at John Wayne movie vistas of desert floor and rocky-brown cliff; two hours later you’re looking at snowcapped peaks that remind you of Switzerland.  Traversing the Rockies did slow me down, but I was past them by about 12:30. The counter of my journey clicked past 2,000 miles just a few miles outside of Grand Junction, where I stopped for a bite of lunch, and then crossed into Utah about 15 miles later.  Most of the afternoon was spent driving through the widest and most utterly desolate landscape I’ve ever seen: imagine films like  The Searchers  and  Stagecoach —that’s eastern Utah. Did the wide spaces of Kansas make me worry about running out of gas? Yes, but that was as nothing compared with the gas-tank anxiety instilled in me by the wasteland of eastern Utah. When I pulled out of Green River after stopping to take a photo and saw a sign that read, “No Services On I-70 Next Hundred Miles,” I was truly spooked. As I mentioned, the Shoe only holds ten gallons. I crept over those mountain passes at 35-50 mph, way under the speed limit, to save fuel. But I still had half a tankful when I reached Salina 100 miles later.  I topped the tank (again) and swung north toward Salt Lake, pulling off the road on the way to photograph one particularly beautiful mountain peak which I somehow knew that Nadya would like (!)  Tomorrow is the last leg of the journey. Interstate 80 lies just a few miles north of here, and owing to my “overshoot,” which took me as far as Salt Lake City airport and allowed me a glimpse of the landscape between here and there, I know that as soon as you swing on to I-80 from Salt Lake, the signs say “Reno.” By tomorrow night I should be at my sister’s house, and I’m not at all sure how I feel about that, but we’ve come this far, let’s see where the rest of the way takes us.   May 26    Monday    dirty motel, Reno   “The rest of the way...”  That last day of the trip across was a long one. I checked out of the Motel 6 at 8 a.m., had breakfast at Denny’s and got moving again.  If I thought eastern Utah was desolate, I had a surprise coming in the stretch of Interstate 80 that runs for another roughly 550 miles between Salt Lake City and the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains which abut the city of Reno. This is country that honestly makes you scratch your head and wonder why anyone would want to inhabit it, and in truth, large stretches of it are uninhabited. This is the great west, not the photogenic west of Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon, but the truly trackless, faceless west which must have held attractions for desperadoes and nobodies of a century and more earlier, people who wanted nothing more and nothing less than to get away and get lost. Getting lost is about the only thing I can imagine western Utah and northern Nevada being good for. A couple of hours out of Salt Lake City, I found myself cruising past the Bonneville salt flats, which were an ideal spot for Craig Breedlove to set the world land speed record in 1964, propelling his rocket-powered car The Spirit of America at 600 mph across an endless expanse of nothing-to-run-into, but I can’t imagine their being much good for anything else.  As I crossed the state line from Utah into Nevada, two things suddenly intruded themselves into my journey: gambling and car trouble.  The moment you pass into Nevada, immediately, even out in the literal middle of nowhere among the sagebrush and the tumbleweeds, casinos and slot machines are suddenly everywhere you look, in every 7-Eleven, every gas station, every restroom.  But I had no time to think about gambling. The moment I crossed the state line into Nevada, I stopped for gas and made a horrifying discovery: the Blue Shoe, which had made it over the Rockies as steadfastly as the Little Engine That Could, was suddenly leaking transmission fluid. I still had 350 miles to traverse, and now I had a problem. I had to soldier on, so I went into a convenience store, walked past the slot machines and bought a bottle of transmission sealant which I hoped would solve things. The car could break down once we got to Reno if it wanted to, but we had to get there first. I poured the sealant into the Shoe, filled her with gas, and got back on I-80.  There is only one word to describe northeastern Nevada: depressing. This is the desert, and they mean it. Even the towns, miles and miles apart and huddled amongst vast expanses of bare brown and relentless scrub, make your heart sink. As a matter of fact, when I decided it was time to make another stop for gas, and to check the progress of my transmission fluid leak, I found that I was making that stop in a spot which the Washington Post, in a 2001 article, had designated “The Armpit of America:” Battle Mountain, Nevada.  I had been living in Maryland, beautiful, green, rolling-hills Maryland, when I read the article about Battle Mountain. The author certainly made it sound grim, but somehow I couldn’t believe that any place could be all that bad; surely, this must have been just another case of some snotfaced, hothouse-flower, east-coast limpwrist taking a sneering, condescending attitude toward one of the red states.  Nope. Battle Mountain was every bit as depressing as the Post said it was. Indeed, it was around noon now, and I was hungry as well as worried about my car, but decided not to even stop there for a hamburger; it was just too grim to linger. And I found to my intense dismay, when I stopped for gas, that the Shoe was still leaking transmission fluid. I did the only thing I could do beyond checking into a motel and staying in Battle Mountain while I let a mechanic work on my car (unthinkable!) I bought and threw into the transmission another bottle of sealant, and on I went.  50 miles beyond Battle Mountain, (above which tower, by the way, on the side of the storied mountain overlooking the town, the gigantic white letters “BM,” and we’ll just let that stand) you come to Winnemucca, which ain’t much better. In fact, during my sojourn here in Reno I was actually offered a job as a reporter on the newspaper in Winnemucca. I drove 180 miles, each way, to meet and chat with the editor of the paper, who took me on a tour of the town, which didn’t take long. From what I was able to surmise, there are basically three things you can do in Winnemucca: gamble, go to church and drink. The town has a population of 4,000, and four casinos. There is a church on every other corner, and no shortage of liquor stores. The nearest city of any size is Reno, three and a half hours to the southwest. If you want to drive for five hours in a northerly direction, you can visit Boise, Idaho. But the point is, you’re going to be looking at pretty much nothing but desolation for the next few hours whichever direction you take. Winnemucca was once a silver-mining town. The silver has long since tapered off, leaving the town without a whole lot to justify its continued existence outside of the fact that it’s already there. Although I had been out of work for more than half a year at the time I was offered this job, I turned it down. I just couldn’t see myself plunking down in such a place to live in the middle of a rerun of The High Chapparal. Winnemucca, close-up, positively reeked of the threat of boredom, which could easily lead one to become a drunk, an addicted gambler, or perhaps worse, a Jehovah’s Witness. Pass.  I made it to Reno late that afternoon. My half-sister and her husband live in a “gated community” on the outskirts of this Nevada city, which is sprawling even as its central industry, gambling, dies out. Reno is in transition: its casinos are doomed, thanks to the burgeoning Indian-reservation gambling industry across the line in California. Why should people drive all the way to Reno to gamble if they can gamble right there in California, simply by driving up on to the local Native American reservation? Well, they gradually won’t, and Reno, as a gaming spot, does indeed seem to have no future.  But even as its gambling industry dries up, help is on the way: simply due to the fact that Nevada real estate is cheaper than California real estate, industries are pulling up their roots—many of them Silicon Valley roots—and transplanting themselves to industrial parks in Reno. During my two-month sojourn here, I’ve been unable to find steady work, but did do a little bit of “temping” at Horizon USA, which has a massive, warehouselike facility here, in which rows of pixies on telephones take orders from customers. There are many other such industrial “warehouses” on the southeastern outskirts of Reno these days, and more coming.  My initial plan when I arrived here was to take another shot at getting a commercial driver’s license. I even went and talked with a guy at Western Trucking School, explaining that I had not passed the course in Indianapolis. The reason, I felt, was that C1, the trucking school I attended there, was essentially a robot factory: they have contracts with two Arkansas trucking companies which call for them to churn out so many drivers per month: the turnover in the trucking industry is huge, because few people want to drive over-the-road (basically, living 28 days per month in your truck) for more than a short while. At C1 you had two, or at most, three weeks to get your CDL or you were out. Well, I’m a quick study for some things, but driving a semi isn’t one of them: I apparently needed more than three weeks, and they weren’t willing to play ball with me.  Western Trucking School would have been willing, but my half-sister talked me out of going to another trucking school. She was sure that, somewhere in Reno, I could find a better job than driving a truck.  Well, I couldn’t. The curse stayed on. Finally I hatched one of those harebrained “plans” of which I’ve hatched so many in my life, and which almost never work out: I would attend bartending school, get a job tending bar somewhere along the Reno “strip,” and put myself through the graduate program at the University of Nevada, finally getting my M.A. after all these years.  That might have worked, but personal problems with my sister and brother-in-law prevented any such long-term planning. Anyone who has ever gone home for Thanksgiving will understand that, all too often, family members are the worst people you can stay with, especially if you’ve been out on your own for a few years, as I have, and are settled into a routine with which you’re comfortable and familiar.  Bottom line: my half-sister kicked me out of her house. Actually, she didn’t even have the guts to do it herself. She took her grandsons to the park and let her husband kick me out of the house.  In fact I wondered why, after having taken them to the park yesterday afternoon, she would go off again, at nine O’clock this morning, with the same destination?  Now I know.  My half-sister: a self-proclaimed churchgoing Christian who has God’s moral rectitude just oozing out of her nostrils.  Never misses a chance to wear her piety on her sleeve. But that doesn’t stop her from talking about other people behind their backs, nor, by the way, does it stop her from bitching about how an influx of Mexicans is ruining the neighborhood.  My churchgoing half-sister had been keeping me under her version of “surveillance.”  Now, I’ve been followed around by the best of them: The CIA, the FBI and the Russian Federal Security Service. Who would have thought that the first among my “shadowers” to openly admit having gone through the garbage on my account would be, not any of the above agencies, but my own half-sister, who not so long ago told me in a letter, “Before you went off to school, you were my darling little baby,” and who also said of my staying at her house in Reno, “You’re safer here than you’ve ever been.”  She’s real good at spreading around marzipan about “darling little babies.” She’s just as good at sticking a shiv right between your shoulder blades. And here’s the hell of it: after a busy week of talking about other people behind their backs, “judging others over her tea,” so to speak, she goes off to Sunday school, convinced that she’s Jesus’ little lamb. Kind of nauseating, when you think about it.  The issue, of course, was my private drinking habits. Now, my half-sister is no Baptist teetotaler: she will reach for the brandy bottle after work, and uncork a bottle of wine while she’s fixing dinner. But what’s OK for her apparently isn’t for others. She and her husband have both been, for many years, curiously two-faced about alcohol: they’ll drink themselves, but they look askance at anyone else doing it. I knew this, and so I tried to be very discreet come cocktail time: I kept my Scotch bottle in my room, and if I wanted to have a couple of belts before dinner, I’d slip in there and close the door, usually turning on The Golden Girls on cable TV as I did so. Now it comes to light that my half-sister was not only closely watching my every move, and giving regular reports to my other sister on the telephone about how she supposedly “smelled alcohol” on me, but was actually digging through her own trash to see how many empties I was throwing out. She actually lied to my other sister, informing her that I was tossing out three empties per week. That’s a barefaced lie: I’ve never drunk that much in my life. I’d be sick if I drank that much. When I was in the foreign service, we were warned that hostile intelligence agencies would go through our trash to see what they could learn about our personal habits. But I never thought that my own flesh and blood would pull a stunt like that—and then talk about it behind my back, no less. As bad as the KGB may have been, at least they didn’t gossip.  Well, this presented me with a problem. I signed up more than a week ago to attend bartending school here in Reno. I also pre-paid for the course. To pull out of town now and head back for the old family homestead in southern California would mean forfeiting close to $900. I didn’t want to do that. But staying on at my half-sister’s Happy House of Hypocrisy was also out of the question, so this morning while she was out in the backyard with her grandsons, hugely relieved, no doubt, that her holy house had been cleansed of Sin now that her husband had handled the dirty work for her, I quietly packed up the Blue Shoe and drove away. (And by the way, learned later that she had had the nerve to complain to complain, on the phone, to my other older sister about my not having said “Goodbye,” or “Thank you!” Surreal.)  I am, for the next seven days anyhow, staying at the Best Value Lodge on S. Virginia Street here in Reno. To say that this place resembles the Bates Motel would do it too much honor: this is the crummiest fleabag I’ve ever stayed in. But it has a bed, a refrigerator, a microwave and a TV, and it doesn’t have churchy, two-faced, back-stabbing relatives.  I called home of course, and talked with Dad. He was hesitant about giving me the green light to come on down, but when I assured him that parking on the street and sleeping on the couch in the “granny flat” out back would be fine, he relented. He said he would tell Lynn about it himself, but of course I had already discussed it with her. She can’t wait for me to get there.  The bartending school will be just another waste of time, as I won’t be staying on in Reno, but I paid for it, so I’m going to attend. First class is tomorrow morning at 10:30.
