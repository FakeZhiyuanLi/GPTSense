      First of all, I can't believe that Ray Charles died yesterday.  The music legend was... well... a legend.  I actually hadn't heard any news about him in so long that I forgot he was still alive, but now that his death has been publicized and I've been reminded that he was alive yesterday morning, I'm saddened to find out that he was alive and now is dead.  He will be missed.  I was watching some of State Funeral of Ronald Reagan and I have to say it's really an amazing funeral... and I know... I've been to plenty, unfortunately.  There are 4,000 seats in the Cathedral and they're all filled with family, friends, colleagues and dignitaries from around the world.  The ceremony was really touching.  The family is strong and know that his death was probably for the best since his Alzheimer's was getting so bad that he didn't recognize his wife and his true love anymore.  I was really interested in hearing George Bush's (senior) speech.  I thought it was nice.  It wasn't all politics and businesslike... it was touching.  You could hear it in his choked-up voice that Reagan was special to him.  Afterall, the Gipper gave him his shot by taking him on as Vice-President... and the two of them did have weekly lunches by themselves just to spend time together.  President Bush's Eulogy was nice as well, but I don't think it was as personal as it could have been, in my opinion.  But Bush senior definitely showed emotion, a tear or two, showing us just how much their relationship meant to him.  The somber look on the faces of the thousands of people attending the service and the hundreds of thousands of people at the Belmont Stakes when the announcement of his death came over the loudspeaker was a sobering reminder that a President touches the lives of a lot of people on not only a political level, but a personal level... the lives of more people than he can even imagine.  Rest In Peace Ronald Wilson Reagan and Ray Charles... our thoughts are with the both of you... jam on.  QOTD - "How come some of the same flights are 3 hours while some are 7 hours?

      First off I'd like to welcome a few new people, Greg, Rich and Marni (happy birthday Marni), to the ever-so-wonderful, funny, clever, insightful Thought of the Day club.  I don't know how many times I have mentioned this, but the doorman in my office is absolutely hilarious.  I got to work this morning and apparently had a nice conversation with him, though I wouldn't know because I can't understand a word he says beyond "How you David, how you?  Good.  Me good Fed Ex come I call you."  I said, "sure" and then continued on my way up the 3 flights of stairs to my office.  A couple hours later the buzzer rang and Jose called me down - "Fed Ex deeleevry" - to get the package.  I got down there and in broken English, he asked me which bar we were going to after work today.  Apparently he had asked me to hang out after work when we were talking this morning and I said "sure".  I told him I forgot that I had other plans and said maybe another time.  Now I have the doorman thinking we're best friends because I can't understand a word he says and accidentally have great conversations with him, I have a boss who is the devil in disguise, I have the devil's son who thinks my friends are chiseled and stares at me a little too long for me NOT to think he's checking me out and I have Randy who, although one of the oddest people I have ever met, sometimes seems normal next to everyone else.  I have to get the hell out of here before the maintenance guy asks me to the movies.  QOTD -  "I had a very smart professor back at State.

      I got a lecture from an older woman in my elevator this morning for not saying "good morning".  The doors opened on my floor and there was a grumpy looking woman standing in the elevator.  Normally, I will say good morning quietly because you never know who is and who is not a morning person.  Well, this person didn't look like a friendly person first thing in the morning.  So instead of saying good morning to her, I did my friendly nod and lip tuck half-smile to her.  Loudly, and with an accent, she then said "GOOD MORNING!"  I replied with a slightly quieter "good morning."  "IN MY COUNTRY IT IS COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO SAY GOOD MORNING WHEN THEY SEE SOMEONE," she said. "AMERICANS ARE AFRAID TO SAY IT AND NOT HAVE IT SAID BACK TO THEM!"  I tried to explain that it's not all Americans... just a lot of New Yorkers with the, in the words of Billy Joel (for Ron's sake), New York state of mind.  You know what I have a problem with?  People who say New Yorkers are so rude.  Well, I think it's ruder to lecture someone on not saying Good Morning than to just not say Good Morning.

      I got a call at work where the salesman telling me that I qualified to get a free subscription to 3 magazines.  I said that I was at work and she replied by telling me that was the way they do this.  They call people at work in order to reach them and send the magazines to their home address.  This is the solicitors' way around the "No-Call" list that the state set up.  I saw on the news that soon cell phones can be registered in order to avoid cell phone solicitors.  These people are not going to give up, though... if they don't find you at home, they'll come to your work.  If they don't find you at work, they'll call your cell.  If you don't pick up, they'll send you a text message... maybe an instant message to your computer.  They're like mosquitoes... or Drew... they'll keep annoying you until you kill them.

      I stopped at a crosswalk this morning and saw a woman and her friend walking an infant in a stroller.  The baby didn't look old enough to be able to speak, yet the mother's friend was trying to get the kid to say "good morning".  After repeating herself in a cutesy baby-talk voice saying, "Say good morning.  Say good morning.  Say good morning.  Say good morn...", the mother finally stepped in to try and get the baby to speak, "Say good morning to Mrs. Frank.  Say good morning to Mrs. Frank.  Say good morning to Mrs. Frank for mommy."  This kid isn't going to talk until he's 6.  Why can't these women start off with something easy for the kid like, "Say hi", instead of long sentences with multiple syllables?  It's little things like this that mess kids up so much that they grow up to be weird.  I bet 25 years from now the kid's going to be in jail for going on a killing spree -- killing all women with the last name Frank.

      Have you ever dreaded going to work so much because you know that as much as you hate your job normally, today is going to be even worse.  It's like the movie, "Office Space" where each day you are at work is the worst day.  Well, I got to work today and Marc is out of the office today on business.  He and Matt had both been out on Friday for a family function in Kansas City.  Anyway, Marc had come into the office on Friday briefly before flying out and had accidentally forgotten his credit card.  He called the office and Randy was taking care of everything.  She was Overnighting his credit card to him at the hotel.  I guess he called Randy at home on Saturday evening to see if she could find out where the package was since he hadn't received it yet.  Turns out... she forgot to click the "Saturday Delivery" button so his credit card did not arrive to Kansas City until today which does him no good since he's in North Carolina on business.  Anyway, since he didn't have a credit card, he had to have his parents pay for his room.  Marc checked out early to catch his flight to NC and when Matt got the bill, he noticed that Marc had rented a porno.  That's just horrifying.  The last people you'd want to know that, are your parents (unless you are a parent and then you'd try and keep that from your kids).

      I am sick of hearing Monica Lewinsky complain that Clinton has "damaged" her reputation.  Now that his book is out, she is feeling especially hurt that he refers to their situation as an "inappropriate encounter" whereas she is saying that they had a meaningful mutual relationship.  I'm sorry, but come on Monica... wise up!   How meaningful could it have been?  He's a married man.  He's the President of the United States and she was an overweight overachieving annoying intern (not saying much for him though)  Monica: May I? President: Sure... why not?  I can get away with it.  Who will ever know?  All the other world leaders do it. Monica: Mmm President: What are you doing with that?  Don't... oh... Fidel Castro gave me that one to me himself... it's a Cuban! Monica: Ooh President: I believe this has just become an inappropriate encounter.  She's now claiming that her life is in shambles because of the publicity she got over the inappropriate encounter she had with Clinton.  Doubtful.  She's now the host of a reality show on television (something called "Mr. Personality"), she's written a book called "Monica's Story", she has her own line of handbags and at only 30-years-old she's already able to afford to own a nice apartment in Manhattan.  I highly doubt she'd be as well off if her name wasn't always in the spotlight.  So my advice to you, Monica... stop complaining and make the most of the situation you put yourself in by having "relations" with a married man who happened to be the 42nd President of the United States.

      Clinton's autobiography is selling like crazy.  Barnes and Noble apparently sold 50,000 copies the first day.  With a retail cost of $35 and a special online cost of $21, that's well over $1 million dollars... in Barnes and Noble alone!  The total first day sales topped the 400,000 mark which is amazing since that one day covered Clinton's advance from the publishing house of $10 million.  I remember the big deal that was made when Hillary Clinton's book came out and made sales history... Bill's book doubled her sales.  That is one wealthy family now.  When's Chelsea's book coming out?  Why can't the Met's play at a stadium named after their team?  I was reminded that the Mets and Yankees are going to be playing one another this weekend and got caught in a sentance no Mets fan likes to accidentally say, "Which stadium are they playing at?  Yankee or Met?"  Damn!  It was too late... I had already given a Yankee fan ammunition!  "It's called Shea Stadium.  They don't have a stadium named after them!"  Yeah yeah yeah... I know... they're not good enough to have a stadium named after them, people say.  Well, I say, maybe they'd be better if they had some motivation like playing home games at a home stadium with their name in bright lights.  The Jets are the same way.  If the proposal to build a stadium for the Jets on the West Side of NYC, then maybe they'd play better too (if it's called Jets Stadium, that is).  In conclusion... Yankees suck.

      The following is a guest TOTD and a perfect opportunity to try out my blog (www.totdqotd.blogspot.com) which allows you to respond with comments to the writer.  On to the guest TOTD by Jay Weisberger...  So, several friends of mine (on both the East and West Coasts) were discussing something that affected a few of us and I think there needs to be a larger discussion to reach a consensus.  Then, someone needs to publish the results in some sort of peer reviewed dating journal.  Here was the initial conversation: You’re dating someone, with some sort of exclusivity and things are going swimmingly.  Or maybe they are not, say, you had a fight or something.  Either way, let’s say that person suddenly stops calling you out of the blue, despite some spoken terms of dating (in other words, this isn’t someone you’re just going out with to see what happens, you are actually trying a more formal relationship).  There may be circumstances you know about (sickness in the family, or something personal of that sort) or not.    The question is, though, how long is the “statute of limitations” on your relationship if you just flat out don’t hear for someone and cannot get in touch with them through a variety of means?  Essentially, how long until you are, by default, single?  From talking to several people who have been in situations like this, and form some personal experience, we’re saying about 10 days.  This means, even if someone had a parent die, is laid up in a hospital somewhere or simply lost a cell phone, 10 days is ample time for that person, or someone who is friends with that person, to make a quick phone call or write two lines of e-mail.  If that’s not happening, you are freed from any obligation to said relationship.  Is this a realistic proposal?  My thinking is that if you are important enough to someone, they can let you know what’s going on even in the worst of times.  Even if it’s just a “heads up” that he or she is busy, but wanted to say hello and let you know what’s happening.  If they cannot do that, over 10 days, you’re back on the market.  Discuss.

      Saturday night, I sucked up my pain and limped around the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut with some friends.  On the drive to the casino, I felt really good about my prospects of leaving there with more money than I arrived with.  I just had a feeling.  It quickly dawned on my that my "feeling" wasn't worth diddlysquat... which is coincidentally how much I am worth post-casino.  Oh well... I had fun with friends and that's what matters, right?  I, at least, understand that losing at a casino is the norm and that the majority of the people around me are also losing money.  A wise man once said to me (and now I like to claim the wisdom as my own and pass it along to others), "casinos don't look the way they do because people win when they visit".  I have two pieces of advice for the casino-goer.    First - find the $5 or $10 tables... $15 if necessary, but try to avoid the $25 ones.  Four hands of black jack and you could be out $100... or two hands of doubling down and getting a 3 as that last card... or one hand of splitting and then doubling.  Second - never go to a table where the dealer or pit boss has a uni-brow.  In general, uni-brows are associated with mean people.  Well it turns out that dealers with uni-brows, in addition to being mean, are also very good dealers and like to take your money.  Then when they try to look sympathetic towards you after taking your money, they smile and wrinkle their foreheads, but instead of looking friendly, they just look mean because of the uni-brow.  I think I should stick to poker with my friends where I am guaranteed to take their money since I'm a more talented player than them (in my opinion).  Talent comes from within, it isn't learned.

      Sorry about the lack of TOTD on Friday, folks.  I actually was injured playing Rugby Thursday night and spent Friday doing nothing but sitting on my ass with my sprained ankle up and iced.  What am I doing?  I can't lie to you people.  I rolled the ankle playing volleyball.  When I got back to my building after the game Thursday night, I hopped through the revolving door and the doorman asked what happened.  I told him and he looked at me and suggested that I tell other people it was injured in a sport like football or hockey... but volleyball didn't sound rough enough to cause this injury.  Happy first day of summer!  It's going to rain the rest of the week, but at least it's nice out today... that's the way it should be.  Unable to play golf on Saturday with my brother due to my sprain, I went to this small sports bar with my brother and a friend of his Saturday afternoon to watch some US Open golf while my sister-in-law was having a little baby shower.  Anyway, this bar was classic.  The three of us stroll in (me limping behind them) at around 12:30 in the afternoon.  There was one other customer there and the skanky 41-year-old bartender who seemed to have been around the block a few times.  The other patron was an older smelly guy with two teeth.  I turned to my brother and said, "The Big Easy seems like a classy joint compared to this place", then I offered him the Cheese Doodles that had been sitting in a basket on the bar for who knows how long!  I've seen my share of dive bars, but this place took the cake.  Though it had a pool table, couple dart boards, a golden tee machine and a couple other games, this place was a real crap-hole.  Maybe with a lot of creative vision and a lot of renovating this place could be upgraded to just plain crappy.  Anyway, gotta love the small-town local spots.

      Ahh... it's here.  Though the official beginning of summer was here a few weeks ago, everyone knows that July 4th is really the start of the summer fun.  You know what else July 4th means?  It means I'll be getting out of work early today and enjoying the weather this weekend.  It means being able to go out with friends on a Thursday night and not have to worry about bringing my "A" game to work since the phones will be dead.  Did I mention it means that I get to leave work early?  It also means that I don't have to go to work on Monday (which subsequently means that you won't get a TOTD on Monday).  It means that the streets will be filled with drunkards trying to get home from the beach where they had a few brewskies.  It means the waterways will be filled with the rest of the drunks trying to navigate their boats around one another trying to figure out who has the bigger boat and therefore has the right of way.  It means traffic in the City will be ridiculous since the FDR Drive will be closed to cars and filled with pedestrians hoping to catch a glimpse of the fireworks on the East River over the heads of the massive amounts of tall people standing in front of them.  It means that I need to stop writing so I can finish up pretending to do work so I can leave the office early.  QOTD -  "That's a shame, being that it's the 4th of July and all. Kids like you should be out having fun. Drinking, partying, running over people, getting away with murder, things like that." - Muse Watson as 'Ben Willis' in "I Know What You Did Last Summer"  ENJOY YOUR LONG WEEKEND!

      A very “interesting” guest Thought from Shannon:  I just had to go pee!! That’s how it started…I just wanted to get inside a bathroom stall before my small beer filled bladder exploded but instead my virgin eyes witnessed an act most men would pay to see. Okay, back to the beginning. Since Nick and I are alcoholics we wandered into B-Bar for a late night drink. Upon arrival I decided I had to go pee. What happened next has officially scarred me for life. Two girls were waiting in line ahead of me. When a stall opened up they both went in. A little strange but I thought maybe one of them just needed help with their bra or something. Next thing I know their feet are facing each other. It clicked in…neither of them were having bra difficulties…they were kissing. So okay, they just want to make out. This is New York…I’ve been to Greenwich Village.    Finally, I got into the stall next to them. All of the sudden a pair of feet appeared underneath the wall separating me and the horny girls. The sounds changed…now I felt like I was in college and my roommates boyfriend was visiting for the weekend. Except there were no male moans. I walked out of the stall and apparently one of the girls magically grew a penis or invested in a well made plastic accessory. The other girl however had definitely listened to Lil’ John a few times and was bent over to the floor and touching her toes. Thoughts began to run though my head…is one a man, hermaphrodite, strap on, dildos dildos dildos…I was so confused. I tried to think back to when I saw them outside the stall…they both had boobs right? I left the bathroom in disbelief…I guess I will never know the answers to my questions.    So witnessing this has made me question public displays of affection. Nick and I have been called grinding ho’s before…but we’re only dirty on the dance floor. How far is too far and when and where is it okay to get down and do the nasty?        QOTD –  Nick: The girl with the strap on gets the shaft. Me: literally! (Nick stating the fact that one girl is not getting any pleasure out of the situation)

      It has been suggested to me via an anonymous reader on my blog (www.totdqotd.blogspot.com) that I need to add more hate to my Thought of the Days... I guess lately I've been too "SICKENINGLY HEARTENING".  You know what I hate?  I hate idiotic fools who ride public transportation, mainly the bus, and really aren't qualified for such a difficult task.  Whereas I am very pleased that these imbeciles are not driving their own cars, I think the public bus may be a little too advanced and that they should be riding a special bus.  I enjoy taking the bus just to watch these people.  This woman who was sitting in front of me pressed the strip to signify that she wanted get off at the next stop.  The light had already been lit, but that didn't matter to this woman... she was determined to press it for herself.  She must have been hard of hearing because she didn't hear the "ping" sound go off when she touched the yellow strip the first time.  So, like any abnormal person who didn't trust that the "Stop Requested" light by the driver would signify that someone wanted to get off, she kept pressing the strip and the pinging kept on going off.  This is annoying normally, but at 8:15 in the morning, it is extremely annoying.    So we were pulling up to 75th street stop where this woman wanted to get off.  The bus stop was on the north side of the street, but we had to stop for the traffic light.  She got up from her seat and walked to the doors in the back of the bus which I was sitting across from, grabbed the handles and pushed forward.  Since we had not yet arrived at the bus stop, the doors were still locked.  Realizing that the doors were not opening, she panicked and began to violently push and kick the door trying to get the door open.  The driver noticed this and yelled for her to stop her tantrum.  She started yelling back to him saying that she was stuck.  She wasn't stuck in the door or anything, but since all she yelled was "I'M STUCK DAMNIT", the driver ran back to help her.  Finding that she was not stuck, he asked her what her problem is and when she explained very loudly so everyone could hear that she was stuck on the bus and the doors wouldn't open he said, "Lady, the stop is across the street!"  The driver got back to the front of the bus just as the traffic light had gone through a cycle and was turning red again so we were all stuck at the light.  People on the bus weren't very pleased with her to say the least.  To myself, I remembered the guy on the subway the other day and said, "Next stop's coming up... bitch".  I guess it wasn't really to myself, though since the woman turned around to look at me and a couple people around me started laughing under their breath.  The moral of this story... learn to ride the bus so I don't make fun of you.  QOTD -  "Get off the meds, grandma." - Girl behind me while watching the psycho try and break down the door

      I went to the Jersey Shore this weekend with Suzanne and her family.  I took Monday off as well so I could have an extended weekend there.  The beaches were beautiful and the weather was in the 80's.  Yesterday afternoon, there was a panic on the beach.  A 5-year-old girl disappeared the next beach over from us and the lifeguards were put on red alert.  They pulled everyone out of the water and lined up the lifeguards to do a sweep of the ocean, taking one step and then diving, then another step and then diving.  They had the coast guard around and rescuers on jet skis, kayaks, and rescue boards.  They had people searching the streets in case she had wandered off.  Everyone was staring at the life guards and looking around the beach.  Sirens from emergency vehicles were blaring.  Finally, the search ended and the lifeguards got out of the water and started running back in our direction to their posts.  The girl had been found wandering the streets a couple towns from where she had disappeared.  She walked pretty far.  As the lifeguards ran by, some people applauded.   I think it's nice that everyone on the beach supported the lifeguards.  There was a real feeling of community on the beach that afternoon... a sense of closeness as parents held their kids and older siblings looked out for their younger siblings.  There was one boy who put his hand on his little brother's shoulder and said, "if you were little, where would you run off to?"  The togetherness that I saw on the beach reminded me of the togetherness I felt after September 11th... people forget for a moment about their own problems and show genuine concern for others.

      I got stuck sitting next to an odd fellow on the train this morning.  I was trying to read but kept getting distracted by his constant moving around and shuffling the newspaper.  He finished his paper, took out a hardcover book, turned to the page he had marked with his bookmark and continued to read.  I was reading my book and minding my own business when he started shuffling through his bag again this time breaking out a highlighter.  I'm always curious when people need to highlight or underline passages in books.  Text books are one thing when wanting to study, but a regular novel is another.  So I started giving myself a headache by keeping my head facing my book in front of me while trying to stare to the side towards his page marking in order to read without looking conspicuous.  He was highlighting religious phrases and passages.  I thought to myself, "great, I'm next to a fricken bible freak!"  Why mark the passages?  Do you think he will go back to them at a later date.  It's not like he was marking passages in the Bible for the sermon he was going to give later today, this was a regular novel.  I like to think of myself as worldly character who is in tune to his surroundings and a good understanding of people.  But I also like to think highly of myself... because I have no clue what this guy was doing.

      Sunglasses are an amazing product.  Surely it's purely psychological, but when I put on a pair of sunglasses, I just feel cooler - in both senses of the word.  I feel I look like the stud I am while at the same time, I think I sweat less because my body is cooled down.  I don't get it... the temperature is the same outside whether I'm wearing sunglasses or not... the sun is still beating down on me.  I think it has something to do with thinking that you've escaped the sun and are now standing or walking in the shade.  The extra shade makes weather like this a little more tolerable.  Don't get me wrong, I love it when the sun shines but the heat kills me sometimes.  Does anyone else think this way or is it just me?

      I hope you all had a nice Fourth of July weekend and that it was a "long" one for you all.  I put long in quotations there because I'm a strong believer that the work-week should really only be 3 or 4 days long and the weekend being 3 or 4 days.  We have it all messed up.  With the invention of better computers and better equipment was supposed to come more relaxation and less stress in the work place.  Instead, we now do 500 times as much in one day as used to get done, yet we're still working just as long or even longer in some cases.  Some people are hooked up and therefore can be reached by phone or email 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  The Europeans have the right idea.  They get a minimum of a month off and they're not shy about actually taking the time off from work.  They go on "holiday" with their friends and family and see the world.  We feel lucky if we can get 2 days off of work.  By "we" I mean "me" and by "lucky" I mean "hatred toward our boss".  Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed your one day off.  To please all you dedicated readers out there, I am going to tell you a story of Saturday night that will bring a smile (or at least a little grin) to your faces.  Recently, I was prodded into writing an embarrassing TOTD about myself, but did not want to.  You have all been patient, so why not share.  I was caught on Metro-North doing what no man wants to ever get caught doing.  It was embarrassing for me, and I'm sure it was embarrassing for Suzanne sitting next to me.  Not since the days of being called on in class at an "inappropriate moment" in middle school has a man suffered such embarrassment.  You know what?  I don't think I want to share this with you.  Oh well, what the heck... I got caught... I got caught... I got caught... DAMN YOU ALL!  I got caught whistling "Oops! ... I Did It Again" by Britney Spears.  But not only was I whistling it, but I was doing so with excitement.  I must have heard the song right before getting on the train, because I can assure you that I don't normally whistle her tunes.  Not since the time I was out with Suzanne and  I got hit on by a guy with a "College" shirt on who called me a "little bag of fun" have I seen her laugh so hard.  Let the records show, I am not a Britney fan.  Also, when I think about you, I don't really touch myself, despite what I may say when singing along with the radio.

      My apartment&nbsp;building has slow small elevators.&nbsp; So when the elevator arrived at my floor to take me to the lobby and there were 2 women in it already, I had to squeeze in it since we all had bags with us.&nbsp; On most mornings, the elevator doesn't make too many stops... I guess it's one of the luxuries of being in a building with 5 elevators.&nbsp; Not this morning, though.&nbsp; The elevator made 6 more stops so that we had a total of 8 people in it&nbsp; I was the only guy... what are the odds of that happening?&nbsp; There are 400 plus apartments in my building and I was the only guy in an elevator of 8 people at a time when most people are on their way to work?&nbsp; Just seems mathematically incorrect.&nbsp; Then again, what the hell would I know about math...

      Man, it stormed like crazy in the City yesterday... freaked me out a bit with all the lightening, but no thunder.  It's sort of eerie when you see the storm, but don't hear it too... it's as if you're in the eye of the storm.  It's storms like these that make me wonder just how mankind has lasted so long.  We're not bright.  We walk around in lightening storms feeling protected because we have umbrellas... otherwise known as metal rods we hold above our heads.  Why don't they make umbrellas with a hard rubber top or grip.  Seems to me that that would be a good use for rubber.  QOTD -  "Who buys an umbrella anyway?

      First things first, I insulted one of my faithful followers yesterday by forgetting to mention his birthday as well... so, happy belated birthday, Rich.  Today, on the other hand, is an all new day where we will honor and celebrate the birthday of Sean Ryan... happy birthday, buddy... and congratulations are in order since he will be moving into a new house on Friday which, using his superior architectural skills, he designed.  On to the real stuff, baby - I just read that an English man has been sent to jail for 5 years for possessing an illegal firearm.  Supposedly, this guy was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in his pants and on his way back to the pub to finish his argument with a friend of his which he had over 15 pints of beer, when the gun accidentally went off shooting his testicles.  I don't buy it... I know what really happened.  I think he wanted to shoot off his testicles.  I attended the Prince concert last night at Madison Square Garden and you should have seen how crazy the ladies wooed him every time he'd raise his voice an octave.  Women love men who can hit the high notes.  This guy surely can hit those notes now.  Too bad he'll only impress his cell mate with that skill.  QOTD -  "I like Emeril Lagasse.

      This is the birthday month I guess... happy birthday to Nora... hope it's a fun-filled day.  To celebrate Nora's birthday, since I know how much of a Prince fan she is, I am going to attend the concert tonight at Madison Square Garden.  I'll be thinking of you.  I received an email from my mother the other day.  Unlike the Thought of the Day which you receive on a daily basis, this is the type of email that we hate.  It's not spam... it's the distant cousin that of spam that makes spam look well behaved.. it's B.S. - "Beyond Spam".  The content of that email was extremely disturbing.  It was just a forwarded email which has ended up in my inbox at least a dozen other times within the past few years,  but the fact that my mother passed it along was what really killed me.   MARK YOUR CALENDAR FOR NEXT SATURDAY:  AS YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW, IT IS A SIN FOR A TALIBAN MALE TO SEE ANY WOMAN  OTHER THAN HIS WIFE NAKED, AND THAT HE MUST COMMIT SUICIDE IF HE DOES.  SO NEXT SATURDAY AT 4 P.M. EASTERN TIME ALL AMERICAN WOMEN ARE ASKED TO WALK  OUT OF THEIR HOUSES COMPLETELY NAKED TO HELP WEED OUT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD TERRORISTS. CIRCLING YOUR BLOCK FOR ONE HOUR IS RECOMMENDED FOR THIS ANTI- TERRORIST EFFORT. ALL MEN ARE TO POSITION THEMSELVES IN LAWN CHAIRS IN FRONT OF THEIR  HOUSE TO PROVE THEY ARE NOT TALIBAN, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY THINK ITS OKAY TO SEE NUDE WOMEN OTHER THAN THEIR WIFE AND TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR ALL AMERICAN WOMEN AND SINCE THE TALIBAN ALSO DOES NOT APPROVE OF ALCOHOL, A COLD 6-PACK AT YOUR SIDE IS FURTHER PROOF OF YOUR ANTI-TALIBAN SENTIMENT. FOR GOOD MEASURE, HAVE VARIOUS PORK PRODUCTS COOKING ON YOUR BBQ GRILL. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT APPRECIATES YOUR EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT TERRORISTS AND APPLAUDS YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS ANTI-TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  GOD BLESS AMERICA.  IT IS YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO PASS THIS ON.    Now I'm sorry, but this is disturbing... I didn't want to picture my mom naked.  I didn't even want to picture her reading the email and thinking that was humorous.  The words "Naked" and "Mom" should never be thought of in the same sentence... unless of course we are referring to YO MAMA.

      First off, I'd like to wish a very happy birthday to my sister-in-law, Debbie... I won't mention the age, but let's just say she's somewhere in the 28-year-old vicinity.  Hope you have a great day.  I got stuck in traffic yesterday last evening.  I don't mean the kind where you crawl along for a while and get frustrated that you're only going 5-10 miles per hour.  I'm talking about the kind of traffic where you sit with your car in park and break out the hibachis since you won't be moving an inch for at least an hour type of traffic.  If I'm not is a rush to get somewhere, I shrug off traffic like this realizing that things like this happen.  With the police cars zooming up the shoulder, you have to think that there's a good reason for the delay... it's not just some moron driving slowly in the left lane.  When there is traffic like this, there are always the asses who think that they are too special to sit there and feel it is necessary to speed up the shoulder... these are the same people who used to cut the elementary school lunch line on pizza day so they could get their lunch while it was still hot.  The only excuse for speeding up the shoulder is if you or your passenger is giving birth.  Bathroom isn't an issue... there are plenty of trees to hide behind and plenty of leaves to wipe with.  Every once in a while a police car would fly by in the shoulder and then get stuck because of the nimrods who were taking up the shoulder.  It's there for emergencies, people... if that were an ambulance, someone may have died because some people don't have any patience.  Once the parking lot became a highway again, I felt a sense of total satisfaction seeing all of the people who drove in the shoulder, getting tickets from the cops.  Ahh... sweet revenge.  Those people deserved to get tickets and it felt real good to see that... almost orgasmic.  QOTD -  "This is one of the worst peanut butter and traffic jams I've ever seen. Get it?

      I've had some requests to tell how the job interview went... you know, the one from the other day that was bound to start off on the wrong foot after the interviewer messed up the date of the interview and then sounded frustrated over the phone as to the why the mix-up occurred.&nbsp; Well... I was right.&nbsp; The position, which seemed perfect for me, is bound to go to a less qualified candidate all because this chick was in a bad mood because she wasn't careful in scheduling her days.&nbsp; I showed up at the company's office which was in a nice loft type of space in the Chelsea Market to a greeting from my interviewer, "Glad you showed up... today."&nbsp; I again apologized for the mix-up and explained how bad I felt that I had to check the voicemail she had originally left me setting the date and time multiple times just to be sure there, in fact, was no mistake on my part.&nbsp; We sat down in the conference room and she began by saying, "Sorry if these questions seem generic, but we've received like 200 resumes and interviewed so many people already."&nbsp; To be honest... that didn't sound as promising as the other day when she assured me that it would be worth BOTH our time for me to come in for the interview.&nbsp; We're talking for 45 minutes and I'm giving her all the correct answers and chiming in with my own questions and comments when it was appropriate.&nbsp; Then she says, "well, I'm done here."&nbsp; We left the conference room and as she was walking me out, I asked her for a business card.&nbsp; She gave me a little grief since she didn't have a card on her and would have to go to her desk.&nbsp; We started walking towards her desk and she told me to go back and wait in the reception area.&nbsp; Okay... whatever.&nbsp; She's gone a little while and then comes over and hands me her card while explaining that I was the first,&nbsp;(much to my surprise)&nbsp;person she interviewed who asked for a business card.&nbsp; She told me that it's a little test she does to see who will ask for one.&nbsp; At this point, I see a ray of light since I passed her little test.&nbsp; I shake her hand to say goodbye...   ME: Well, thank you very much.&nbsp; I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.&nbsp; I hope we can speak again soon.   HER: Press the red button and the door will unlock.&nbsp; The elevator is on your right.   Well that wasn't the best ending, right?&nbsp; I am sick of having a crappy job and having to make excuses to leave my crappy job to interview for what seem to be promising jobs only to be misled into thinking I will hear back from these people shortly and then not hearing from them, lied to about the decision process and then receiving a rejection letter in the mail, or just flat out shot down rudely.&nbsp; I need a way out.   You guys know me best... what type of jobs do you think I'd be good at?&nbsp; Let's start a list on the blog ( urlLink http://www.totdqotd.blogspot.com/ ).   1. Prison Consultant  2. Breast Feeding Coach (not for my sister-in-law, though... that's just sick)  3. Socialite  4. Poker Champion  5. Writer   Anyway... keep the list going... I'm curious what you think.

      I believe it was Noal who owned the button down shirt with pictures of lobsters all over it. To me, that is an okay shirt. It's a "relax, I'm on vacation shirt". I understand that, I have a couple of those at well which nobody but myself can stand the sight of. But this morning I saw a guy wearing a yellow polo shirt with little red crabs all over it. Now that doesn't say "relax, I'm on vacation", it screams, "I OWN A BOAT AND LIVE IN CONNECTICUT!" It's just wrong.   Speaking of things that are just wrong, Kentucky Fried Chicken is threatening to boycott a West Virginia plant because of alleged chicken abuse. Maybe it's just me, but this seems odd for two reasons. The first being the obvious reason that KFC's entire business revolves around the killing and cooking of chickens... which I believe is the worst kind of abuse. The second reason the boycott seems odd is that the plant is in West Virginia. KFC had to have known there'd be some sort of abuse going on... beatings or at least sexual abuse... it's West Virginia after all!

      Happy birthday to Shannon and happy BIRTHday to Zachary Jordan Silbergleit.  &nbsp;  I had this entire Thought of the Day planned for today talking about how bad I felt after my interview yesterday and how unfair it was that she didn't like me because SHE messed up the timing of the interview... so despite how well it could have been and how good of a fit I would have had there, I felt I got the shaft.  &nbsp;  But I can't write about that, because I'm not angry anymore.&nbsp; I just got a call from my brother.&nbsp; As of 8:44 this morning, I am an uncle.&nbsp; Zachary Jordan Silbergleit... welcome to the world outside Deb's stomach.&nbsp; I hope you like sailing because your room is covered with sail boats.&nbsp; Congratulations to Deb and Jason... and Zach, you and me are going to have a nice juicy steak someday... don't fall for that no red meat thing Deb practices.  &nbsp;  QOTD -  &nbsp;  "What up uncle?"- Jason to me

      Happy Birthday to Jen Hilgert and a congratulations as well in her recent engagement to another TOTDer and good friend of mine, Kris Clark. I can't help but feel that if it were not for my Thought of the Day, these two never would have found each other. I don't know why I would think that, they did not meet at a TOTD party, nor do they even read past the first couple of lines of a TOTD unless it's got some sort of flare, but deep down, I think my ramblings have made this all possible. Anyway, congratulations you two... I know you'll both be happy and so will I when we have the bachelor party... WOO HOO!   On a less exciting note. I have an interview this evening after work. I'm not going to go into details regarding the position because I don't want to jinx myself. I had a really good feeling about this interview. The woman interviewing me spoke with a tone that really made it sound as if she genuinely wanted to meet with me because I am a good candidate for the job. She came right out and said that she liked my resume and that it would be "worth both our while" for me to go in for an interview. I got home from work yesterday all ready to do some more background research on the company so I would be prepared. I went to the bathroom and the phone rang. I let in ring and then got the voicemail when I was finished in the little boys room. It was from the interviewer. "Um, hi David, this is _______ from _______. I'm just wondering where you are. It's 6:20 and our receptionist has left so I've been walking to the reception area every so often to look for you. Please call me... just curious why you're not here."   As you can imagine, I began to panic and freak out a bit. I listened to an older voicemail she had left me verifying our interview time and was able to relax a bit knowing that I was right. I'll tell you why I'm not there, Miss... my interview isn't until Tuesday! I got a hold of her and explained that we were supposed to meet on Tuesday, not Monday but I could go in at that moment if she would prefer. She admitted that she vaguely remembered the meeting being on Tuesday and had accidentally written Monday in her notes. So, inadvertently, I have already started off on the wrong foot. She stayed late at work waiting for me and I didn't show up... not only that, but I made her feel silly for writing down the wrong day. Way to go D-Butta... that wasn't so smoove.  &nbsp;  QOTD -   "Uh uh, no. Condoms are for single men.

      "Today", on NBC this morning, had as a guest Martha Stewart's "Prison Consultant". What the hell did this guy do to become a prison consultant? Did he spend the majority of his life in and out of the prison system? I guess he's the person who looks at the other prisoners and decides which person Martha should latch on to and become a bitch for in order to survive. I hear about a job like this and it makes me sick. You know this guys sits at home and watches "Oz" and a bunch of prison pornos on Cinemax late night and Adult Movies on Demand and then charges Martha for the RESEARCH he had just done.  &nbsp; "Don't drop the soap when Big Mamma is around you.

      First off, happy birthday to Christopher Papaleo (aka Pops)... hope you have a great day. Also, congratulations to Debbie Nall for her 'Bryant Park #3" photo which won the "AMATEUR USA BEST PLACES" category in a Women In Photography International photo exhibition (I guess they like crooked photos... ha!).  I almost got hit by a bike messenger this morning when crossing the street. To avoid me, he swerved into oncoming traffic, almost getting hit by a car. I wonder what the life expectancy of a bike messenger is? If a risk management executive was to assess the insurability of a bike messenger, what would s/he find? In Manhattan the price of a slice of pizza has traditionally equaled that of one subway ride. I believe the life expectancy of a bike messenger is similar in that it corresponds with the average lifespan of a Manhattan restaurant or bar... just about 2 years.

      Sorry everyone... I forgot to mention I wouldn't be sending out a TOTD yesterday (and I appreciate all your notes checking in with me), but we had the bris for my nephew.&nbsp; The bris, for those of you unfamiliar, is the ceremonial circumcision of a newborn Jewish baby which is performed by a Mohel (for more info...  urlLink http://www.torahview.com/bris/html/the_bris.html ).&nbsp; So, we're at my brother's house and this young guy who looked younger than me showed up and we thought he was the Mohel... turns out he was the Mohel's assistant... an apprentice or an intern, if you will.&nbsp;   After the event and before the Mohel and his young apprentice left the house, I approached the young kid and asked him, "How do you practice?"&nbsp; I mean seriously... I would think that it's tough to practice a circumcision.&nbsp; In response to my question, he replied, "I had a friend who was interviewing to get into Columbia Dental School and asked when they get their first patient.&nbsp; He was told that the students practice on each other first."&nbsp; He continued, "But this is nothing like that"  It turns out that they just study medical procedures and work as an apprentice for a long time.&nbsp; I just wouldn't want my son to be under the knife of a first-timer.&nbsp; Scary thought.&nbsp; A scarier thought, though... Nick asked me if as the uncle I got to do the "snip snip"... thankfully... they leave that to the professionals (and their interns... HA)  QOTD -  "That boy is going to make some girl VERY happy" - The Mohel to a few of us in regards to his 'size' - so watch yourselves ladies!  Dave/Milhouse

      After I wrote my TOTD last week about getting passed by with jobs all the time, my friend Sashimi Yamamora sent me an article referring to a recent study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeaster University showing that the growth in the employment population in the US over the past few years is due new immigrants. The study found that from the beginning of 2001 through the beginning of 2004 over 2 million new immigrants have found work in the US while the number of native born or longer-term immigrant workers has declined by more than 1.3 million. As I was reading this uninteresting article I came across one fact that really stood out. The director of the Center for Labor Market Studies is named Andrew Sum. I thought this was great. What type of career do you go into if your name is Sum... an analytical one of course where you try and find results that sum something up. That's like Mrs. Beagle... the woman that used to groom our family dog when growing up. Of course she'd grow up to be dog groomer... she had no choice with that name.

      Suzanne's Birthday was yesterday... so first off, happy birthday! I hope you enjoyed yourself (otherwise I stink as a boyfriend). Her parents had planned to take us out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday so that I could celebrate with her on Sunday, her actual birthday (seems like only a year ago - to the day - that I was liquoring her up and then licking her face to get her attention). Before dinner, her mother and I are talking and she asked me what I had planned to do for Suzanne's birthday dinner...  Mrs. F: Any special dinner plans for tomorrow? Me: Yep... I found a place called 'Barcelona' in South Norwalk Mrs.. F: Oh? Me: It's supposed to be a nice Tapas Restaurant and Wine Bar  (Silence)  Mrs.. F: Okay Me: Yeah... Suzanne really likes wine and it'll be something different... she'll have a good time. Mrs. F:  (after a long hesitation and sounding a bit uncomfortable)  Well, I hope you dance for her.  I did made a hesitant laugh not knowing where she was going with this but thinking she was making some kind of joke which I should politely laugh at. It was puzzling, but I forgot about it until later that night. Dinner with her parents was nice and then we left and went back to her place. We had rented "Starsky and Hutch" from Netflix and were watching it. They walked into a strip club and it hit me like a sledgehammer. Her mom thought I said "topless" instead of "tapas". I felt horrible. Her mom called on Sunday to wish her a happy birthday and Suzanne asked her mom about it. Sure enough, she thought I had said "topless" and had seen a new side of me ( the side you all know... mwahahahahaha ). Not the side I wanted her parents to see.

      Since I will not be in tomorrow and therefore depriving you all of your daily dose of cleverness, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Kerrie Waterhouse (soon to be Kerrie Pelletter) ahead of time on her wedding which will be on Saturday. Congratulations... Pete is one lucky guy.  You ever have one of those days where you're just so glad that it is raining. I was walking to work this morning and something wet hit my head... it felt like a big drop of something. Normally I'd be grossed out a little thinking it was a big drop of "mystery liquid" falling from somewhere on the building next to me, but this time I was crossing the street and there was no place for this to fall from. My next thought was pigeon crap... why me, huh? Why? I touched the spot on my head where the liquid fell, but it was just wet, no color, so started worrying that maybe the pigeon had the "runs". Then one by one, rain drops started coming down slowly. I had never been so happy to walk in the rain... thank God it was only rain.  On another totally different note, have you heard the latest from Cingular Wireless? They've come up with the ultimate luxury service for their customers... and I can't believe none of other companies have thought of this. I mean where was this service back in the day when I was on my many-a-bad Jdates. "Escape-A-Date" is their new service that lets you schedule a phone call at a pre-set time. The phone will ring at the specified time and the message will guide you on a way out of the date... check out this example of what the phone will say:  Hey, this is your escape-a-date call. If you're looking for an excuse, I got it. Just repeat after me, and you'll be on your way!  "Not again! Why does that always happen to you?...Alright, I'll be right there." Now tell 'em that your roommate got locked out, and you have to go let them in. Good luck!  This is hilarious... I so could have used this a few times myself instead of just pretending that my phone was ringing and having a fake conversation with someone (this also came in handy for me when trying to get out of work early once). No more excusing yourself to the bathroom and then trying to squeeze through the bathroom's small frosted window only to end up in a rat and cockroach infested alley. No more jumping out of a moving cab to avoid answering the question, "will I see you again?". No more going for hikes near lakes and pretending to drown while secretly swimming to the other end underwater using a blowfish as your air supply.

      A sewer exploded across the street from my office.  The building shook and the sound scared the crap out of me.  People in the streets were panicking and the police were there within seconds on their radios.  The fire trucks showed up within a couple of minutes (good thing there's a firehouse a block away).  So they marked off the area and started controlling traffic a bit.  But the genius cops wave a Hess oil truck drive by.  A sewer explodes, police and firemen don't know the cause yet because the experts have not yet arrived, and yet they let a Hess truck drive by... what if it exploded again?  Sometimes I really don't understand what is going through people's heads.

      I don't really like to abuse my power as a literary genius to make you do things you wouldn't normally do, but every once in a while something comes my way that I think I should share with y'all. A TOTDer sent me an email yesterday that might interest some of you regarding the federal government looking to eliminate educational programs that promote condom use and instead, will only promote those programs that promote abstinence. So in order to help Jen keep her job promoting condom use, please email HIVComments@cdc.gov and tell them what you think about their idea for cutting the programs. I think cutting the condom program is like cutting a condom... no good things can come from it.  On another note, I was reading an article on Crain's website yesterday and saw that the FDA approved Pfizer's Lipitor drug for other uses besides its initial purpose of lowering your cholesterol. I don't get it... isn't high cholesterol directly related to the cause for many heart attacks? So, if I am understanding this correctly, Pfizer's stock price rose yesterday because the FDA approved an already existing drug to continue doing what it has been doing all along. Sure... that makes sense. Way to go FDA... way to use your time wisely.  QOTD -  "In women's health news, the FDA announced that it has approved NuvaRing, a new highly effective birth control device for women. NuvaRing is 2 inches long and releases a continuous low dose of estrogen... just like Michael Jackson's penis." - Tina Fey on "Saturday Night Live"  Dave/Milhouse, BA

      First off, I'd like to wish Mario a happy belated birthday. I hope your day was full of happiness and that Ben took good care of you if you know what I mean. I also want to wish Jeremy a safe flight today and the best of luck at USC... I just hope Los Angeles is ready for him!  As much as I try to hide my feelings behind hilarious jokes and a calm, collective, handsome look, I have to tell you, this latest terror threat has me a little freaked out. I know that these places have been "threatened" since the the attacks on the the US on September 11, 2001, but the latest threats against our country by Al Qaeda have shown that they have a great amount of detail regarding the specific targets threatened. One of the landmarks, the Citigroup Center is located just a couple blocks from my apartment. Al Qaeda supposedly has notes on the blueprints of the buildings, the security systems and security schedule, notes on the assumed structural damage if an explosive was to go off. That, to me is beyond a minor threat... you don't waste time and energy getting studying that information for no reason. I don't feel to safe living that close. With all the tall buildings around my apartment, the damage could be devastating... it's got me a bit on edge.  QOTD -  "Fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper. You can make a hundred brilliant saves but the only shot that people remember is the one that gets past you." - Paul Wilkinson  Peace out, Dave/Milhouse, BA

      Happy Friday, the 13th, everyone... I hope your day is a lucky one!  Wow, so New Jersey just can't seem to get out of a slump.  First they smell, then Mario moves there and now the Governor is going to resign because of a gay sex scandal.  I heard that they've decided to just give up.  They're sick of being the Garden State... everyone always mocks them, "Where's the garden?  Smells more like a dump."  I think New York is going to turn them down for citizenship... ever since that argument over who actually had the property rights to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, New York has been trying to sweep them under the rug.  Besides, we have enough pollution in our state that we don't need any more from their over-use of hairspray.  At the moment, I understand that the highest bidders for New Jersey are Pennsylvania, Delaware and Alaska.  Pennsylvania already has a lot of greenery and could really use some more roadways... plus they really wanted to take advantage getting the Atlantic City derelicts to counter all of the Amish goody-two-shoes (never quite understood that phrase... do bad kids only wear one shoe?).  They'd also like to take advantage of the Jersey Shore because without it, they only have Hershey as a vacation destination.  Delaware is only interested in New Jersey because it wants more real estate.  "Wayne's World" did a number on their egos back in 1992.  Alaska just wants New Jersey to join them so that they can finally be a part of the "continental united states" (Hawaii could care less about those haolies).  The last option which doesn't seem to be getting as much attention is the formation of a new state which includes New Jersey, Chelsea, the West Village and San Francisco.  Christopher Street in Manhattan will be the capital, Argyle (J.K.) will be Governor and the Queer Eye guys will be "on his staff".

      I almost stepped in dog crap on my walk to work this morning.  It was one of those crowded areas where the street narrows due to outdoor seating at a restaurant and the high volumes of pedestrians are squeezing by each other to get to where they want to go.  Someone crossed my path and I had to swerve quickly to avoid physical contact with this person (lucky for him... you DO NOT want to mess with me... I'm like a massive muscle machine!).  In avoiding this guy, my foot almost landed right in a pile of dog crap.  I started to think about it... if I stepped in the crap, I wouldn't want to wear my shoes into my office.  We have carpeting in our office and the the crap would just settle into the fabric and it would smell terrible forever... even after I cleaned my shoes.  Then again, if I did take my shoes off before coming into the office, there'd still be the stink from my feet after walking 30 blocks to work.  For those of you that have witnessed me taking my shoes off after walking all day in them can attest to the horrifying funk.  To leave on or not to leave on... that was almost the question.

      I'm reading a book that I find very enjoyable, not because it's a deep and intense novel like "The DaVinci Code", but because the concept behind it fascinates me. I think the author has a real talent for writing dialogue. He's not afraid to throw the 'F' word into play every so often. Unfortunately, I find myself a little embarrassed to be reading the book in public. The embarrassment has nothing to do with it's content, rather it is the book itself. The cover is very feminine... it looks like the cover of a chick romance novel. But it's far from a chick novel. And the author is far from a chick author. The book is called "The Deed" and it was written by Keith Blanchard, the Editor of Maxim Magazine. I find myself folding the cover over or concentrating on covering the front cover so nobody sees that I'm reading what appears to be a chick book. It's taking me a while to get through the book, despite my interest in it, due to the fact I'm spending more of my concentration on hiding the book cover than I am on reading the story. The book is great though... I read the book and can really imagine myself as the main character... the things he observes are very similar to things I would observe and then force upon your reading eyes in my TOTD. I'd recommend the book, but only if you have a left over book covers from middle school. Attached is a picture of the cover... you'll see what I mean.

      First off, I'd like to wish Ken and Liz a very happy 2-year anniversary on this Tuesday, August 10th.  So I got the oddest most unexpected voicemail this morning.  It was a rejection message for a job I had applied for a couple of weeks ago.  The position was a sales planning position with Time Warner's entertainment division which would work with TBS and TNT.  The job sounded interesting and I though it might lead to something decent in the future as well.  What I did not catch was that it would be working on "Team Winiarski"... and even if I had noticed that, not that seeing that would have meant anything to me.  So I get this message that starts off like a normal rejection message and then spins off.  Take a listen:  "Mr. Silbergleit.  I am calling in regards to the sales planning position at Time Warner.  I personally wanted to tell you that although your resume is impressive, we can't have you come in for an interview.  My name is Karen Winiarski and the opening is on my team and I don't want you on it.  At first I didn't know if this was you, but I remembered that you worked at Edelman and I saw it on your resume.  I don't know if you remember me.  We met at Arriba Arriba and went out and I thought we had a good time.  But you didn't call me again.  I called you for a second date, but you never called me back.  I emailed you and you didn't email me back.  You are lucky there are people like me out here that will get back to you even though you don't deserve it.  You send a resume, you want to hear something, and now you have.  Don't expect a job in my group.  Have a nice day.  Good luck with your job search."  I'm a little surprised she didn't mention anything about loving to eat cheese in the message since the psycho couldn't talk about anything else during the date from hell!  I'm just upset that I accidentally deleted the voicemail while trying to listen to it again to get the wording correct... this is the type of message you save for years for a good chuckle.

      A guest thought from the sicker and more twisted than mine mind of Mario...  I don't normally get the chance to ride the NYC subway during the week. Considering that I live/work in NJ there is little call for it unless I happen to wander in for an occasion. This occasion was my first trip to Yankee Stadium! I had won some free tickets from work. They weren't great seats (bleacher), but free is free.  So I was taking the 'D' train up to the stadium. The car was fairly packed with quite a variety of people: the well dressed ladies and gentlemen in business suits, the odd construction worker, and some random kids, but mostly people going up to the Bronx to watch their beloved Yankees. I have to say that it is absolutely amazing what people will talk about while riding the sub way. On my left were two girls. I'd guess 12-14 or so. I wasn't paying much attention to what they were going on and on about until a couple of words caught my attention... "When I was pregnant my t*ts got so, f***in' big". I looked up from staring at the floor and made eye contact with the woman sitting next to them (early 30's, big green eyes, freckles, almost your typical red head... except she was tan). I got the most desperate look of horror and a plea of help from this woman. I just looked at her and shrugged.  For another 60 or so streets (on the local this seems like forever!) these two girls went on discussing rather explicit details about their sex lives. Who they were "bangin'" etc. I couldn't believe that these two girls were going on and on like this on the train! Sounded like they were giving out more rides than the MTA! The woman sitting next to them looked absolutely appalled. Finally, these girls got off the train with a whole gaggle of people a few stops before the stadium. The woman’s friend moved over and sat next to her. She had the biggest look of relief on her face to be sitting next to someone with a little bit of sanity!  So we make it to Yankee stadium... FYI bleacher seats are ~$8, Hot dogs are $1, pretzels are ~$1.25, coke is $1. Not so bad for sitting on a hard piece of extruded aluminum for 7 innings. That’s right just seven innings.. Yankee's were getting spanked (glee for a Mets fan to watch the droves of Yankee faith full belittle the highest paid team in baseball), so we decided to leave before the rest of the stadium - to avoid being jammed onto the sub way.  So back onto the train... Staring at the floor. I noticed this guys shoes. Very unusual. Looks like alligator or snake skin. Then I noticed this guys has cream colored plaid pants on. Bizarre.... So I finally glance up and take a look at this guy. Sort of well dressed, but sleazy at the same time. I also noticed the two women (girls?) sitting next to him. Neither one of them was really attractive, but overly done up and sort of scantily clad. Two completely different body types. One was very skinny; almost anorexic in appearance, like a toothpick with a wig and excessive makeup on. The other was sort of plump and curvy. I'm thinking -- is this dude pimpin'?? No way they are going out. I glanced at my watch. 9:50. A bit early to be going out. This dude has got to be pimpin'!!! They get off the train in the low 100's..  NYC is a very strange town.. In a day you can see just about everything: Penn Station, MSG, Steinbrenner's money making empire, subway rats, and pools of water you can't help but wonder were they came from. You get to see all kinds of people too: everything from business people right down to the oldest profession in the world, with a rather large helping of your average John and Jane Doe in the middle, with a few modern day hippies thrown in for good measure.  Guest QOTD from J.T. -  "For all those men who say, "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free". Here's an update for you. Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage, why? Because women realize it's not worth buying an entire Pig, just to get a little sausage." - Andy Rooney  Hope you don't have a case of the "Mondays", Dave/Milhouse, BA
