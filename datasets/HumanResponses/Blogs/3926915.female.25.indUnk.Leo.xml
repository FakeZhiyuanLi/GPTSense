      Oh boy. It's hard to be just outside a tragic event because you feel really blue but in a weird way, you feel like you don't have a right to be sad. I guess you can just be sad for the people involved, which is what I am. Pretty depressing, huh?

      So I was telling my mother a particularly offensive (I thought) story about someone I know that involved accepting expensive gifts in exchange for, well, one can only venture a guess...anyway, there is much more to the story but since I've been running my mouth about it all the livelong day, I'm too tired to repeat it here in its entirety. Basically you need to know that I described despicable actions by a disgusting person I'm angry and ashamed to know. My mother's response? "You're too judgmental." Huh?! Needless to say, I  made  her see it my way, but there is something terribly wrong when my mother deems  me  too "high-horse-y." So in the end, I was doubly troubled this afternoon-which, although amusing to say, is not amusing to be.  I am attending some ridiculous event this evening to which I must wear fancy dress and feign a solid adherence to the tenets of conservatism and that irascible George W. (I'm guessing here)...I'll keep you posted although I'm about 85 percent sure I'll make it out unscathed. It's that 15 percent possibility that will keep me on my toes.

      I just read this article about Bill Cosby in the Village Voice, the author called him "crotchety" but I can't help remembering the Huxtable gang with fondness. I think its sad when someone who is famous for doing something specific chooses (or is thrust) into a role for which they are unprepared-for example: actor-turned-"voice of a community" or some other such nonsense. I guess in this case he went willingly but I ask you, who among us can resist a finely scripted episode featuring Heathcliff and Co.? Not this girl, that's for sure.  &nbsp;  I'm concerned that I'm actually in the midst of the day that will never end. I mean, is someone kidding around? Because if so, they should knock it off immediately. You know the only thing worse than the day that will never end? A mandatory work happy hour scheduled for 6pm following said day. Also known as Today. Also known as Friday. Jesus. WWCD? That's right, what would Cliff do? I think that is the mantra that shall govern all of my life decisions moving forward. See, corporate-speak is now even infiltrating my overarching "life decisions" talk. They've officially got me all wrapped up. I guess all I can do is go to&nbsp;the happy hour, drink the obligatory 6-8 beers, tell a couple work-related anecdotes (preferably also on the work-humorous side) and stumble home to contemplate how this all managed to happen.  &nbsp;  I hope Cliff prays for me.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Well it definitely just took me a good twenty minutes to figure out how to post something, I guess I should have read the directions. impatience is my virtue, or something like that. I got nothing done at work today and continue to grow more frustrated...but not because I feel I'm being "under-used" or "unchallenged," its more because I'm afraid I'm not smart or capable or analytical enough to do my job. I don't believe in me. It is definitely an odd turn of events and a situation I hope rights itself soon.

      I secretly allow my horoscope to govern how I spend my day and I think it is becoming a problem. I postpone important meetings or decide against essential car repair depending on the power of a complete stranger's suggestion. I also think I'm becoming obsessive-compulsive and fear I will never be able to live with another person due to these heightened idiosyncracies popping up. Actually I don't fear it, I&nbsp;take comfort in the notion that&nbsp;now I have an excuse.

      I know, not very original, but at this point it seems appropriate. Despite the fact that I may be approaching the point at which I will need to start seriously worrying about the health of my job (as opposed to the fake-worrying I do most days), I still cannot seem to accomplish anything. I feel like this is quickly becoming a common thread for me here. Lets analyze this a bit further...I arrive at work on or near the appointed hour, start my computer, check my work email, check my non-work email and then spend nearly two more hours (at least) checking news sites, gossip columns, political blogs and re-checking hotmail. By this point its time for cup of coffee numero dos and once I return to my desk, another cycle of web site browsing (just to make sure I didn't miss anything during my first four go-rounds). I need to stop the insanity, but I'm not sure how. I figured eventually fear would turn me in the right direction but procrastination seems to have beaten even that mighty motivator into the ground. I'm not sure what to do. I guess my best bet is to go home and enjoy the weekend and hope that next week will be the week in which I manage to concentrate long enough to get SOMETHING completed before the mid to late week blues dampen my spirit and leave me vulnerable to the power of the internet. Another thing working in my favor: I'm only in the office Monday and Tuesday. I'll keep you posted (hahahahaha) as to how it goes.
