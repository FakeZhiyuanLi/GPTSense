       urlLink Gwen Shamblin 's Weigh Down Diet: What Makes Weigh Down Different? Eat Your Favorite Foods!   A Christ-based diet?  You've got to be kidding!  These christians will use their "religion" to sell anything.  (I use a lowercase "c" because I know real Christians, and these are not them).    First they sell a president; now deformed M&Ms.  Interesting that they don't mention doing any exercise.  Also, they don't seem to follow any of the biblical dietary restrictions.  "God's perfect boundaries of hunger and fullness?"  WTF?

       urlLink Fox Cancels Gay-Themed Reality Show Amid Criticism (washingtonpost.com)   I'm glad it's been canceled before it even gets on the air.  But something good could have come out of it if they showed the contestants getting fired from their jobs, or beaten up, just because they are gay (or perceived to be gay).  A show like this is humiliating, not to the contestants, but to gay people.  Many gay people have to pretend to be straight every day to avoid being beaten up, ostracized, fired, denied housing, or discharged from the military.  That's my "worst nightmare" of being trapped in "straight hell."    This whole fad of "everything gay is now cool" is just another way of humiliating us.  It is so reminiscent of the days when gay men appeared in movies as "the sissy," and only for comic relief and purposes of humiliation.  This show should have been called "Let's Make More Money at the Expense of Gays (and still deny them basic rights)."

       urlLink Results... : "  Morpheus    urlLink   ?? Which Of The Greek Gods Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla  "  Morpheus, huh?  Takes me back to the days in college when I was taking Dr. Christiansen's Comparative Mythology classes.  We read the "Illiad," the "Odyssey", the "Bhagavad gita", the "dhammapada", "The Epic of Gilgamesh", "Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson," Taoist poetry, and other works.  I have to say that those were among my favorite classes in college. They sort of balanced out the accounting, finance, business law, and other more technical and mathematical courses. Although I loved the mythology and classics courses, I just don't think I could have majored in that.  The balance between right brain and left brain was really helpful.    It was almost a conscious decision to focus on a practical major, while taking as many humanities and liberal arts courses as I could.  That way, I got real life skills, while I expanded my mind in classics and world literature, religions, and music.   I like the description that comes along with my "Which of the Greek Gods Are You" quiz.  It's more a reflection of who I was in college when I was rediscovering these Greek myths.  I couldn't wait to get out of that window and into the real world.  Okay, so I was a geek in college.  But as much as I disliked the social aspect of college, I enjoyed the learning.  Big public universities are not made for spoonfeeding education.  They really require one to seek education.  I sometimes wonder if I would have been happier at a liberal arts college, or a smaller eastern school like Cornell, Brown, or Tufts.  Unfortunately, I lacked the maturity to leave Texas.  In my defense, though, I wasn't really aware of opportunities outside of Texas.  I fault the parochial nature of Texas and Texans, the morons the EPISD hired as counselors, and even my own parents for not at least informing me that options outside the universities in Texas actually existed.    I have no regrets, though.  My bookishness made my grades fantastic, and allowed me to get into a fantastic law school (another Texas, school, however).  All of those things have made my current life possible.  I wouldn't trade what I have now for anything.

       urlLink Terror Alert Level : " urlLink      "  Apparently, the R's are worried that they are slipping in the polls, so it's time once again to frighten everyone to death.  They say that they suspect that terrorists are planning an attack in the US over the summer in an attempt to affect the presidential election.  True, there may be a plot to attack the US again, but I think the terror alerts are an attempt to affect the presidential election.

       “To be hoist by one's own petard,” a now proverbial phrase apparently originating with Shakespeare's Hamlet (around 1604) not long after the word entered English (around 1598), means “to blow oneself up with one's own bomb, be undone by one's own devices.”    Hamlet was to be taken out of Denmark by Rosencranz and Guildenstern, who carried a letter instructing the King of England to kill him.  Hamlet changes the letter, and the English kill R and G instead.  They were hoist by their own petard.    I've come across this expression several times it the past few days.  Each time it was in reference to Donald Rumsfeld or his boss.  I've had a feeling since aWol's campaign in 2000 that his and his gang's hubris would be their undoing.  Now I'm sure of it.  Iraq is their petard (oh so appropriately derived from the French word "peter," which means "fart").  They have gotten us into this mess by virtue of their poor planning, overconfidence, and religious zeal.

      Okay, so I didn't manage to write every day.  I'll be more disciplined.  I promise.  I just listened to a few clips by Wu-Tang Clan at  urlLink Tower Records .  I'm afraid I just don't get it.  I can hear that they are trying for an edgy, but not gangster rappish mien, but to my old ears it just sounds like a lot of "fucking this, fucker that."  Maybe I don't understand what they are trying to capture.  I think they are probably some homogenized hip-hop/rap for white kids.   It's such a shame that I don't appreciate that kind of music.  I've sampled a few songs here and there trying to appreciate it, but It just does not stimulate the part of my brain that most other kinds of music do. Country music is the same way, though.

      Never let them see you sweat, or so they say.   urlLink  urlLink This man   has so much to sweat about these days.  The more he sweats the cooler I feel.    I could write all day about how wrong Bush is for the country, the world.  But, I don't want this to be a political journal, but rather, a creative outlet.  So, I'm going to talk a little about how I feel about sweat.    I used to hate it. When I was a child, teen, young adult, I didn't sweat much, even in the El Paso weather.  I guess I was too much of a late bloomer, and it was too dry there.  Over time, my opinion of my own sweat has changed.  I find it inconvenient when I'm waiting for or on the metro. Some steamy days like today, I have to carry a towel or hanky to mop my brow.  I tend to sweat from my head, though.  It may be because I don't have thick hair, so it just runs down my face.   I just came in from running out on the Nation Mall.  It's about 88º F today.  Really, humid too.  I was dripping with sweat, and I loved it. Sometimes when I am at Body Smith, I leave a little trail of sweat wherever I've been.  Shane, my trainer teases me about that.   For some reason, it feels really cleansing to sweat during exercise like that. Another is that it makes me all shiney and shows of my muscle definition to great advantage.   An interesting thing is that I don't sweat when nervous, just when hot or exercising.  I know some people sweat when they get worked up about things.  I tend to get cold. I wonder what that's all about.

       urlLink Pressing For Kids' Fitness (washingtonpost.com)  I wish they'd had weight training in PE when I was 11.   I don't think I would have liked it at the time, but would appreciate it now (like piano lessons). I was such a small kid that it might have given me a little more strength, coordination, and confidence.    I remember when I was coerced into being the manager of the football team.  In the off season, we were given the choice of lifting weights or doing our homework.  I was intimidated by the weight room and always chose to do the homework.  My fool of a guidance counselor, Mr. Hanley, insisted that I had to have some athletic activity on my transcript, or I'd never get into college.  More likely, Mr. Hanley was worried that I was a sissy and wanted to "cure" that.  Wish I'd known that at the time.    The whole time I was football manager, the coaches kept trying to get me to be a wrestler.  I was so very small, less than 90 pounds.  There wouldn't have been anyone in my weight class, and I probably would have only had to wrestle one person to win state.  The whole thought disqusted me, though.

      This was a little piece I wrote for no reason whatsoever the day after the Iraq war started.  I was going to do a series of little stories like this called the "Duct Tape Diaries" about how the war affected ordinary people (if we can call ourselves that). I look back at it now knowing there were no WMDs in Iraq, and that we are no safer now than we were then.    Washington, DC:   Duct Tape Diaries  “We Apologize for the Delay . . .”     Something blew up on the Metro the morning after the war started.   As usual, I was running late for work.  The train had only gone one stop from where I’d gotten on.  The doors snapped opened in their efficient DC Metro way. Almost the instant the train door opened, there was a loud bang, and woman screamed (I thought that only happened in movies).    Because this is DC, the pre-9/11 part of my brain thought, “someone’s just been shot.”  Then I thought, “dirty bomb?”  “Clean bomb?”    The train doors remained wide open, and no one moved or said a word.  After a minute or so, some people ventured outside the train doors to see what had happened; the rubbernecking reflex too strong to resist.  Most of us looked at our watches to see how late for work we were already.  There was no announcement from the train driver or over the station’s P.A. system.  Still we waited.    Everyone was so calm.  Only a couple of people ran off the train and up the escalators.  I imagine they weren’t concerned with the radioactive particles or anthrax spores that could be floating in the air.  Rather, they were just hoping that they could get a cab in this neighborhood.    I waited a bit longer, and then decided to walk the eighteen blocks from the station to my office.  I was late already.  A dirty bomb on the metro seemed to be as good an excuse as any to be extremely late to work.    While I walked, I thought about what had just happened, and began to get angry.  The bang was most likely a transformer or some mechanical problem with one of the train cars.  Any other day, this would have been merely inconvenient; a hazard of using public transport.  But this was the morning after Bush decided to throw us into a war of aggression that is guaranteed to energize America’s terrorist enemies of every stripe.     Since World War II, when America has chosen the military option to settle things, the conflict has been fairly remote.  Who was it who said that wars teach Americans geography?  The only Americans in danger were those who didn’t avoid the draft like our current leaders did, or those who volunteered to be there.  This time around, it is all of us in peril.  It doesn’t matter if you don’t happen to live in DC or New York.  You are in danger if you live in Savannah, Tulsa, or Honolulu.  This man in the White House and his team of cold war advisers have recklessly put the whole country in mortal danger.    Supporters of the war might say that the risk of domestic attacks by terrorists is worth it because Iraq may supply terrorists with nuclear weapons. I fall in the camp of people who think that Iraq is the least of our worries when it comes to supplying terrorists with destructive capabilities.  We should be worrying about North Korea, Iran, and all those unguarded Russian nukes.    A remote, clean little war is a nice news item.  But this war is neither, and we all live on the front lines now.

      I have to say, that I love this site.  urlLink FOUND Magazine   When I was a little kid, I picked up all kinds of stuff I found.  Sometimes it was a car fuse, sometimes a note or letter, just something I found interesting for some reason.  People lose the most interesting things.  The best thing about it is before they've lost it, it is trivia.  Once it's been lost and subsequently found, it can be objet d'art.  Much like these weblogs, don't you think?

      I've read weblogs for awhile now.  I wasn't really sure what they were at first, and I wasn't really sure I liked them.  When the internet was born, I wasn't really interested in it, either.  I thought it was primarily the unedited thoughts of adolescents.  My opinion of the internet changed over time, of course.  I now know it is worse than the unedited thoughts of adolescents.  It really is a lot of porn and other useless stuff. Still, it has great shopping.   I didn't understand e-mail at first, either.  I had a telephone.  There were fax machines.  I got plenty of junk in the regular mail.  Why did I need another method of contact?  Once more, I changed my mind.  I love e-mail.  I used to write letters, to my grandmother, mostly.  She's gone now. But e-mail forced me to write in my own voice again.  Now I can send those letters to friends in Europe, Africa, Asia, even Texas.     Weblogs to me were more of the same.  More ramblings of people with delusions of literacy.  I've changed my mind again.  On further examination, I found some really interesting and well written stories, political analysis, and apocrypha.  True, there are weblogs of insipid minutiae, the "today I clipped my toenails . . . " webloggers. But they are more than offset by people with true talent, or at least something real to say.     So, since everything seems to benefit from a another look, a second thought, if you will, I launch my own weblog.  The purpose of the thing for me really isn't to broadcast my ramblings to anyone who comes along.  Rather, I would like to write in my voice, on a regular basis.  I want it to be a creative outlet. Apparently, really good writers write every day, regardless of the topic.  They just write.    So there it is, the "On Second Thought" manifesto.

      I wrote this little piece several years ago after returning from gayday at Disney in Florida.  The day in the park is definitely the reason to go to such a thing.  I'd skip most, if not all, the circuit parties that have built up around it, though.    There it was, an endless line of people, snaking around the maze of crowd control gates.  All of these were people waiting for the same thing – Space Mountain.  After all these years – 24 years, in fact, I would finally join them.    It was a beautiful day.  The sun was bright, the Florida humidity was low, and all the people in the park appeared in fine spirits.  I was not just any day at Disney World, however; it was a special day that happens every year. Although, it never officially happens.  It was Gay Day at Disney!    Gay Day started in 1991 with just a group of gays and lesbians who decided to go to Disney World one day.  They told their friends, and those friends told their friends. And the numbers grew, 2,500 that first year according to the website (www.gayday.com).  Disney had no idea that they were secretly being invaded, visited by fairies of the terrestrial kind.  In succeeding years, the numbers of gays and lesbians who knew of and attended the event rose astronomically.  All this was done under the radar screens of the fundamentalist Christian groups  and the like.  Subtle signals had to be devised to show solidarity and demonstrate to Disney that the gays were in the park in significant numbers.  So, along came the red shirts, some generic, and some created just for the event.    This particular Gay Day was more than just that – it was a victory, a pilgrimage, as sort of triumphal act.   Now, I know what you are thinking: “Oh, great – another story about a gay man repressed in the past, and suddenly able to walk freely in world as himself and revel in the knowledge that he is not alone, not the only one, finally able to share in the fullness of life and love and heartbreak and desire.  Well, yes, this story has that, too.  That story has been done and I think we are all a little tired of it.    This story is one of childhood regrets, envy, and a father’s love and sacrifice, 24 years ago on the other end of the continent.    I, along with my family, went to Disneyland.  I was eight years old, my brothers six and ten.  I remember I was wearing blue shorts and a red t-shirt.  If that was a portent of things to come, it would come as a surprise to my younger (straight) brother, as he was wearing a red shirt that day, too, as I recall.    There it was . . . what the three boys wanted to see the most – even more that the mouse himself:  Space Mountain.  It was magnificent.  It was brand new.  The commercials on television touting the opening of this new ride played night and day on the LA channels we picked up on cable TV at our El Paso, TX home.  The excitement that they generated among the three pre-teen boys was palpable. When my parents announced that Disneyland would be a stop on our summer vacation, the days just couldn’t pass fast enough until we would be there.    And now, here we were, A, B, C, D and E tickets in hand.  In the days before pay-one-price admission fees, Disney sold books of tickets that rationed the best rides based on the number of E tickets a family was willing to purchase.  We’d rationed enough E tickets for all five of us to ride Space Mountain.    The line for Space Mountain that day was the longest line, the largest organized mass of humanity I’d ever seen.  This is what we came for, and these boys would wait in that line for the ecstasy at the other end – Space Mountain!  And so we waited over an hour in the bright California sunshine, and arrived at the turnstiles.  There, the Disney cast member (as Disney euphemistically calls all of its park employees) and cruel fate would conspire to create a lasting childhood memory.  As we stepped up to present our tickets, faces beaming, the Disney cast member produced an object, like an upside down “L” inscribed with the horrible words that would haunt me from that day forward:   “you must be at least this tall to ride this ride.”   You guessed it—after all those commercials, all that excitement, all those rationed E tickets, I was not tall enough to ride the ride!   No  amount of pleading or swearing would convince the Disney cast member to overlook the height requirement just this once.  Imagine the conflict, the pandemonium among in the family.  What a decision!  (We’re not talking “Sophie’s Choice,” or anything like that of course – but what a family dilemma).   My brothers were obviously thinking, “leave him! He’s too small!”  My father, never a fan of roller coasters in the first place, would just as easily have decided that the ride was not going to happen for anyone if it could not happen for everyone.    My mother chose pragmatic justice over my father’s three musketeer approach.  She knew that to have one disappointed boy was better than having three.  This logical approach was communicated to my father using that wordless language that parents use.  And so it was decided that my mother and my brothers would ride Space Mountain, and my father and I would not.  This suited my father just fine, as he would not be required to ride Space Mountain.  We had plenty of low-end A tickets to use up anyway.  My mother and exuberant brothers headed through the turnstiles to Nirvana, and my dad and I off to the Dumbos and teacups.  Strange how if you’ve been smaller than your peers for most of your life, you always think of yourself as small.  But here we were, 24 years later, and all of 5 foot 6, still smaller than most, but easily able to avoid the prohibitions of the terrible “L” shaped measuring stick.  We waited patiently for our time on Space Mountain.  A, B, C, D, and E tickets were a thing of the past, and fastpasses civilized the process by designating an hour window – essentially a reservation – to ride the ride.  As the turnstiles inched closer, my sense of victory and excitement grew.  I smiled at the Disney cast member and cast a hard glance at the measuring stick in his hand.

      If you are in a garden, and you are looking for a thing of beauty, you don't turn over the rocks to find it.    I've spent the day reading the weblog of some little twit down in Florida.  He's a gay boy know-it-all in his mid-twenties.  His greatest insecurity appears to be his intellect.  He repeats in a number of places that he can hold his own against anyone who would question how smart he is.  He also claims to have a "genius level IQ."  He graduated first in his high school class (as if that indicated anything at all), but failed to finish his college education.  He rants about other web loggers failing to use spell-check, but then misspells words in his own web log.  His grammar is not "genius level" to be sure.  He twitters on about being a good writer and having "his own voice."  His "voice" needs an editor.    I don't know why I read these web logs.  They are intended for this very kind of voyeurism, though. They are intentionally and deliciously solipsistic.  They entertain, but also raise my hackles. There is this theme of elitism in his web log.   I have no doubt I was this cocksure when I was in my late twenties. He really feels that he is better than everyone else.  His world is so small and his scope so parochial.  I imagine his inflated sense of importance and selfworth mask a growing awareness that he is your average gay boy in a big world. When did my humility arrive?  Has it yet?  The realization that there is always someone cuter than you, or smarter than you, or more successful than you, or richer than you hasn't quite hit him yet.  When it does, the resolution to be the person you want to be crystallizes, and you stop trying to compete with everyone in the world I think.  Be someone you can respect, and others will respect you. Work at being someone you feel is beautiful, and you will be beautiful to some (but not all).  Love worthy people, and you will be deemed worth loving.    Then, it doesn't feel terrible not to be the prettiest, or the smartest, or the richest boy in the room all the time.   Weblog boy is still in the wanting to be or becoming phase.  When one is in his twenties, it's all training for or becoming the person you want to be for the rest of your life (or at least a good portion of it).

      "The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones: So let it be with Caesar."  Julius Caesar, Act III.  Unfortunately, this applies to Reagan, too.  He left us with a lot of evil to clean up, and very little good to bury with him.    Perhaps instead of naming buildings after the old fool, or putting his face on the currency in place of more deserving folks, we should name things after him for which he bears responsibility.  For example, we could designate the "Ronald Reagan National Debt."  Perhaps since he pretty much made Saddam Hussein, Iraq should be renamed "Reaganland."  Maybe we could redesignate the vegetable he formerly knew as "ketchup" after "Ronald Reagan.," a former vegetable.

      What follows are my thoughts on the debate posed at  urlLink Winning Argument  about whether media consolidation is bad for democracy.&nbsp;   A vibrant democracy depends on information, rich intellectual exchange, and the free flow of ideas from a variety of sources.&nbsp; For this very reason, for most of American history, public policy favored a more decentralized media system to prevent monopoly and preserve localism as well as diversity.&nbsp; The cross-ownership rule, allowing a single company to own broadcast stations and a newspaper in the same market, however, will literally reduce the number of voices heard in the media and degrade the quality of the information and ideas we receive.&nbsp; That is exactly why interest groups on both sides of the aisle (e.g., the NRA, Family Research Council, NOW), as well as millions of citizens are opposed to media consolidation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Americans do have access to far more TV channels than in the past, but five organizations now control enough of those channels to command 75 percent of the prime-time audience. After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed the national cap on radio-station ownership, Clear Channel and Viacom accumulated enough of the strongest stations to give themselves 70 percent of the revenue in radio. The Interweb affords the public low-cost means of communication, but traffic is concentrated on sites controlled by the same corporations that dominate other media.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The consolidation of radio ownership poses a serious problem for the music industry and advertisers. If the other limits on ownership are removed, the ensuing consolidation could have far more ominous implications. Politicians are already loath to defy broadcasters because they are eager for positive TV news coverage and fearful of retribution.&nbsp; More media conglomerates in fewer hands will have even greater sway over public officials. In addition, there is a special danger from mergers of newspapers and broadcast stations in particular communities in the form of reduced news coverage of local affairs as staffs are combined and cut back.  &nbsp;  It is a myth that professional practices in journalism will protect the public from the ravages of concentrated private control over the news media.&nbsp; Our 500-channel universe doesn't mean that we are getting 500 times the examination and investigation of worthy stories. It means we get the same narrow wrap-ups repeated 500 times.&nbsp; One important reason that concentration of media ownership is so bad for democracy is that the autonomy and integrity of U.S. journalism is grievously harmed by this concentration. As media companies have grown larger and larger, the pressure to generate profit from the news has increased. This has meant slashing editorial budgets, cutting down on expensive investigative and international coverage, and allowing for commercial values to play a larger role in decisions to present inexpensive and trivial news topics.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Information is not just any commodity, like oil or textiles, and should be treated appropriately.&nbsp; It is the fuel of our democracy; the purer and more refined the fuel, the better our democracy will run.&nbsp; The kind of media system we deserve is one that delivers the things we need to know pertaining to our lives and liberty and happiness; the kind of information we need to vote and run our democracy.&nbsp; Such a system would be a dedicated to the public interest. A cartel of media corporations cannot be allowed to control such a media system, because these cartels are ultimately hostile to the welfare of the people and friendly to the welfare of their profits.&nbsp; I am not advocating state control of the media.&nbsp; That is anathema to a free exchange of ideas.&nbsp; But the myth that utter deregulation allows the free market to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest cost has been debunked by what has happened in the radio industry.&nbsp; Radio has been destroyed by deregulation. A medium that is arguably the least expensive and most accessible of our major media, that is ideally suited for localism, has been converted into a Wal-Mart–like profit machine for a handful of massive chains.  &nbsp;  Diversity in media ownership may not be the most economically efficient system in the sense that a single company can operate multiple broadcast stations and other media outlets at a lower cost than a combination of smaller units. But there is plainly a cost to diverse, robust and wide-open public debate that makes such consolidation undesirable on other grounds.&nbsp; This cost, in and of itself, harms democracy.&nbsp;

      Andy Warhol said,  urlLink "In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes." &nbsp; Thanks to technology, there's now&nbsp;an infinite number of ways to waste your own personal piece of fame.&nbsp; Some people post their intimate&nbsp;moments on the interweb for all to see through the use of  urlLink webcams . Some post their  urlLink intimate thoughts  for all to read.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;become  urlLink journalists  and  urlLink opinion columnists  to an unknown readership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others would prefer to  urlLink eat bugs  or  urlLink marry strangers  for money.&nbsp; Then, there are the folks who would risk  urlLink being beaten up  just to get their fifteen minutes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Personally, technology has given me the chance to be a  urlLink dj , and a music video producer and short  urlLink film  maker.&nbsp; I've been mixing music for a few years now after taking a short dj course.&nbsp; Now I make what are essentially 80 minute music videos to go along with my musical creations (really, interpretations, since I mix other people's songs, voices, sounds, etc.).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I feel like there is a lot of latent creativity out there.&nbsp; The computer, that wondrous universal tool,&nbsp;is starting to unleash the more recondite talents of an increasing number of folks we heretofore didn't even suspect.&nbsp; Computers, interweb access, digital cameras, web design, etc. have all come down in price, making many of the new creativity tools available to those of more modest incomes (although still sadly excluding the poor and very poor).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know a graduate student in international affairs who uses Powerpoint to come up with interior design concepts and remodeling plans for his apartment.&nbsp; A landscape architect I know is a wiz at Photoshop, making party invitations, posters, etc.&nbsp; I use Photoshop and other simpler graphic programs myself&nbsp;to manipulate images for my cd covers.&nbsp; A friend who works at a bank makes slide shows and short movies of his trips around the country and abroad.&nbsp; These are all people who have satisfying careers, but have tapped a creative impulse that would otherwise have remained dormant.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;That said, the obverse of this explosion of latent creativity is the explosion of mediocrity and banality that this new technology enables.&nbsp; When I was first learning about the interweb, I found it to be an endless sea of unedited thoughts of adolescents.&nbsp; Luckily, some of the adolescents grew up, and some got editors and became real electronic publications.&nbsp; The sad consequence of easily accessible creativity tools is that there are so many djs, columnists, artists, photographers, journalists, etc. to weed through to find the real talent.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My musical creations, as well as my forays into the graphic arts, have been very well received by friends and family (and even strangers).&nbsp; In fact, one of my mix cds is apparently a hit in a Kuwait City gym.&nbsp; A friend of mine lent it to them while visiting, and it caught the ear of the owner.&nbsp; I don't delude myself that my writing on this web log is anything remarkable (merely a mental exercise and a diversion).&nbsp; I also don't think my music&nbsp;or my cd covers are&nbsp;anything close to professional quality.&nbsp; They do give me great pleasure, though.&nbsp; And as long as my friends, family, and the occasional stranger get a kick out of these creations, and will continue to indulge me, I'll keep creating.&nbsp; I'll get my fifteen minutes.&nbsp; But I'll let it play out a second or two here and there over the course of the next fifty years!  &nbsp;  I urge everyone to do the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the author, director, designer,&nbsp;or musician in you, and have at it.&nbsp; The audience is listening . . .&nbsp;or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cares?

      My boyfriend and I have been watching the BBC’s “ urlLink House of Cards ” series this week.  We’ve finished the first trilogy “House of Cards” and the second, “To Play the King.”  I’ve just fallen in love with the whole series thus far and can’t wait to watch the third act, “Final Cut.”  The mendacious and lurid Francis Urquhart (appropriately nicknamed “FU”) is played brilliantly by Ian Richardson.  The schemes he undertakes to secure the office of Prime Minister in the first series are cunning, brazen, and downright brutal.   It seems in the first series that FU is merely trying to get his due when the PM he’s helped to succeed Margaret Thatcher does not reward him properly, or more accurately, not at all, for his loyalty and maneuvering.  I the second series, FU turns out to be a true Tory ideologue, rather than just a powerhungry maniac.   Although this series is pure fiction, I’m learning a great deal about parliamentary government. It functions so differently than our republic.  I absolutely love Prime Minister’s Question Hour.  I’ve watched the real thing on C-Span on a number of occasions, and find it extremely entertaining.  It’s even more so in the TV series as Ian Richardson’s voice is so mellifluous, and his responses so stinging.  How I wish our president were forced to subject himself to that kind of questioning from the Congress from time-to-time.  Bush would be in tatters.   There are some things that are a bit mysterious to me though.  One is that the King was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, a more compliant sort.  I’m still not sure how this was achieved. All it took was to embarrass the King a little bit, and he caved right in.  Another is that there were four “IRA bombings” (actually perpetrated by FU and his wife’s henchmen), and there are no howls from the public about what the PM is going to do about the spate of terrorism.  Perhaps it’s the environment we are in right now, post 9/11, and living in DC, but I think there would be more outrage.  The Brits have dealt with these kinds of bombings for almost a century.  So perhaps they are more sanguine to it all by now.  Of course, this is fiction, and some details must give away to keep the plot moving.   FU’s wife, Elizabeth, assists him in all kinds of ways, including finding him interesting playmates to satisfy his more concupiscent needs.  I asked while watching the other day “what does she get out of this?”  I wonder.  I have  feeling that she will be the ultimate villain, and will get all the spoils at the end.

      The truth finally slips out. President Not-Reagan finally  urlLink lets it out :   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."

      At the time I'm writing this, the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq stands at  urlLink 923 . No doubt it will be higher when you are reading this. When I saw this number, I thought, "that's about double the size of my high school graduating class." It's as if the junior and senior classes of W.H. Burges High School suddenly disappeared. I also noted that  urlLink 78 of the casualties were from Texas , where I grew up.  The cost of the Bush administration’s adventure in Iraq has been high, and still grows. The  urlLink cost in dollars  has been well documented. But the cost in lives remains eerily under-reported. Bill Berkowitz laments:    While the deaths of Iraqis have not been of particular interest to the U.S. media since the war began, it was surprising that the 900th death of a U.S. service member in Iraq didn’t rate either front-page coverage or more than just a passing mention on the news networks and 24/7 cable news channels. In fact, news regarding the identity of the 900th U.S. service member to die in Iraq was relegated to deep inside the first section of many daily newspapers.    Even though the administration has handed off the problem of Iraq to a new Iraqi government, our troops are still there, and they are still dying every day. Yet, the  urlLink administration  has all along treated these deaths like they are  urlLink merely hiccups  in their plans. They take steps to  urlLink conceal them . They refer blithely to breaking eggs and making omelets.  It’s particularly sickening, amongst all the “support the troops” rhetoric, that attempts to honor those who have given their lives for the country have been met with attacks on patriotism and accusations of partisanship. “ urlLink The News Hour ” and “ urlLink Nightline ” have presented some pieces recently on the human cost of the war. Each program was harshly criticized for doing so. Honoring the dead is not unpatriotic or partisan. Failure to do so is.  The ultimate crime of the Iraq war is not the constantly shifting rationales for deploying our troops, or the deplorable failure to plan to get our soldiers out, but forgetting them.
