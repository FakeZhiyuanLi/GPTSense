      Just spent a few hours playing tropico (not played it in ages) and I forgot how addictive it is, I had to force myself away from it...if you don't know what it is, your a president of an island and you have to build things to make money ect. make alliances with countries, and keep your people happy, I always get stuck on this sinario where you keep getting attacked by rebels, I can never manage to hire enough solders to keep them away. =\

      I just searched on google for XMBHost (my main website), and the stupid thing has put my blog over it, I can't see my website now...I think it might be because googles on the crawl and I posted a link to here that was on a forum being crawled (it was an invision board so I could watch it :D) so it's indexed this site, before it's got to my other one again... -_- I hope it goes back to normal soon.

      I might be getting bb (Broadband) soon! My mum said she'd talk to my dad about it, which means she'll force my dad to get it me, so expect me to be going around at superspeed soon :P :D  Maths was even stranger than it usually is today, I think my teacher finally lost the last few cells of her brain, she spent the whole lesson going around taking the mick out of random people O.o  PE was ok today, I did athletics, 200 meter's sprint ect., I thought I did pretty well...  I did a few small changes to the blog today to reflect one or two of the new features blogger has released, If you click on a title, it will take you to a page with only that post on, and if you click on my name which is just under the post, it will take you to my blogger profile.  I think that's it for now, if not, I'll just post another message later :P ;) :D Bye  I think this is the longest message I've ever posted in my blog :D

      And I make that...3 weeks till the holidays, woot :D  Put your hands up if you watched england v. portugal last night...*puts hand up*...and who was gutted afterwards...*puts hand up*...and who thinks there was something dodgy about that ref? *puts hand up* That was a perfectly good goal >:O if we'd have got that goal, we'd still be in, and i'd be in a good mood right now >:O the ref either took bribes or was annoyed about us winning his county 3-0...and UEFA claims these are the best refs in europe...har bloody har har har. This is something that did make me laugh on the radio today though, aparantly, he has a website about him being a ref ect., but it had to be shut down today because it receved over 20,000 hits in one minute from england fans getting his email address (yes, it was on there), so thats cheered me up a teeny bit...and i have his email addy to :D but he prolly deleted it now :(  bye.  - Adrian

      Boring day today...*yawn*  But  I got 1 hour and 30 mins dinner today, because my science teacher had to go somwhere at the last minute...so there were no supply teachers...  And for those of you who are confused about why it extended my dinner, here's a look at how my schools dinners work;  There are 3 half hour sections, 2 of then are used for lessons, 1 used for dinner. It means dinners are at different times every day...well...different times during period 4...4.1, 4.2 and 4.3...  Your all probably confused at that...so i'll go now :P
