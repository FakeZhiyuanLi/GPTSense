      My cousin Chris sent me his Blog to read and asked me to pass it along, so here it is....  http://www.toomadawg.blogspot.com/  to start mine off, in honor of one of my fave comedians new shows, & the fact I go upstate at least 2 times a year I decided to put a forward that one of my upstate pals sent me (see below) Amy & I miss Tyler!!)  Just a quickiefor now... suppose to go to  a Floor hockey game to night to watch the demons.. (there was no rec. hockey last season they were renovating)  Well I dropped by today @ Murry's to see if I coul get a copy of the demons sked, and turns out they're palying the team I want to see them beat.. (and PELASE let them beat the crap out of them (or at least #17 on the team.. I despise the guy now.. such an ass...some of you know the deal about him.. to keep things short, had a crush lead me on so now,  I hope Foley or one of the guys breaks his nose tonight!!) anyway.. the renovations made are nice. a cool color blue was used has some tables to have your snacks at. that's blue too!  The rink actually has NO marks or at least as far as I saw... well here's the forward.. LOL   Jeff Foxworthy on Upstate New York    If you consider it a sport to gather your food by drilling through 36 inches of ice and sitting there all day hoping that the food will swim by,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If you're proud that your region makes the national news 96 nights each year because Saranac Lake is the coldest spot in the nation,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If your local Dairy Queen is closed from September through May,  you might live in Upstate New York    If you instinctively walk like a penguin for six months out of the year,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If someone in a store offers you assistance, and they don't work there,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If your dad's suntan stops at a line curving around the middle of his forehead,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If you have worn shorts and a parka at the same time,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If your town has an equal number of bars and churches,  you might live in Upstate New York.    If you have had a lengthy telephone conversation with someone who dialed a wrong number,  you might live in Upstate New York.    YOU KNOW YOU ARE A TRUE UPSTATE NEW YORKER WHEN:    1. "Vacation" means going South past Albany for the weekend.    2. You measure distance in hours.    3. You know several people who have hit a deer more than once.    4. You often switch from "heat" to "A/C" in the same day and back again.    5. You can drive 65 mph through 2 feet of snow during a raging blizzard, without flinching.    6. You see people wearing camouflage at social events (including weddings).    7. You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked.    8. You carry jumper cables in your car and your girlfriend / wife knows how to use them.    9. You design your kid's Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit.    10. Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are filled with snow.    11. You know all 4 seasons: almost winter, winter, still winter and road construction.    12. You can identify a southern or eastern accent.    13. Your idea of creative landscaping is a statue of a deer next to your blue spruce.    14. You were unaware that there is a legal drinking age.    15. A brat is something you eat.    16. Your neighbor throws a party to celebrate his new pole shed.    17. You go out to fish fry every Friday.    18. Your 4th of July picnic was moved indoors due to frost.    19. You have more miles on your snow blower than your car.    20. You find 0 degrees "a little chilly."    21. You actually understand these jokes, and you forward them to all your Upstate New York friends.    Have an awesome day,  and know that someone who thinks you're great has thought about you today!.. "And that person was me.".....

      (full length will be mailed as soon as I see AvP)              Happy Friday the 13th Hope you are all having/had fun.  Fitting day ya think that 2 legendary killers go head to head? (mm am I having Daja vu? Didn't we just do this? Let's hope this one isn't a disappointment.like Freddy vs. jason was a bit)  Choose your side   Vs. Predator    AVP         anyway... Yesterday (thursday my day off...) woke up and had a bad pain in my neck down through my spine!!!!  Well my Chiropractor sn't scheduled to be in the office on thursdays so i was in pain all day. Woke up today the 13th .. (how fitting.. I guess those two above got after me eh!?)  and I htik the pain was worse... so called in tht i would at least be late.... the ciropractor isn't in til 9:30 so I walked around the apt. cause I didn't want to lay back down.. I had to cradle my neck & back in a spot toactually 'move' it. So I ended up going back and laying down on the couch was actually able to fall asleep awhile.. and got up a little easier. (love 'my' couch..) went to Chiro, and he said i probaly slept funny. (duh!) adjusts me and says go home ice back and come back in afternoon for another adjustment!!!!!!   well feeling a little better at 6:54 pm... but my neck still has pain in it and I can only move myhead a little.  So therefore i din't go to see AVP today.. I'll try saturday. Then send this off..   Opening movie of the week.- Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement  *  PrincessDiaries2.com         fun funny & fabu....   for a rated G movie.. (yeah I went to a kiddie movie..)  I enjoyed it. but then I liked the first one. I see it as a Miss. Congeniality jr.  and one of the guys at work said that was so me.. Lol.... I loved the slumber party sesen. now that's an idea to do.. now I jsut need my own 'castle'  and Queen Grandma ROCKS!    Lol... Also like the fact of them showing what would an american girl do if she were arranged.  you've got a  kinda dorky hunk of a duke..& hunk of a next heir to be 'king'. Hey I got out of my world for awhile and the movie kept me amused and in fantasyland. So I give it a B   even tho the stuff critics; The local paper & Entertainment weekly gave it a C- to a C   but come on critics over anylize everything...  1. does it really matter that the original screenwriter didn't return? (or some other misc. thing)  2. Doesn't it matter that you had fun watching the movie(s) and  3. that it kept your attention?  4. yes it has to be 'smart' but the theater laughed at the right moments and all that.   so I think it deserves at at least what I gave it.
