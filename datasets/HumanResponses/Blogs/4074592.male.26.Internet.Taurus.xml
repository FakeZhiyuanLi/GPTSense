         bacon beeots is now open for business. some may enjoy this blog, and others may not. and i could give a fuck. you see, on my way to work, with a frappacino in my hand, with a detriot pistons jacket, yankees hat, and new england patriot zubaz pants on, while listening to coldplay on my iPod, i released that there was still room on this bandwagon for one more trend that i just don't quite understand why its so popular, but i do it anyway, fearing that i'm not going to get laid anymore if my girlfriend finds out that i don't have a blog, thereby making me a wanksta. and i just can't handle that. so, you can expect to find me talking shit, never talking nice, about anything and everything, mostly current events and other various social phenomena that i observe. wow, this sounds so much different than every other dipshit blog out there. and if it weren't so late in the workday on a friday afternoon, i would dig into my first topic of talking about the big football headed bitch Brandy and her new engagement. but maybe next time, bitches..... and yes, that is a picture of me above.

        Oh shit, maybe not.  At first glance, when the caption said "Juliette Lewis" of "movies that used to be good" fame, I was sure they were making a movie version of the 80s cartoon Jem. But turns out Ms. Lewis has her own band called Juliette Lewis and the Licks.  But with moves like that, it can't go wrong.  I just hope she covers a couple Winger songs, then I'll be happy.  "She's only seventeen, daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me."  They just don't make songs like that anymore, artist just save action like that for home videos.  rock on.

        Several weeks ago, the boys of N*Sync reunited to perform for the first time together in almost two years.  They sang the national anthem for a basketball all-star tournament.  And all at once, the whole world was hoping that they were going to reunite and restore order to the music industry once again.  But no dice.  After swapping stories about who they had all banged over past 18 months, Timberlake realized he had nothing to gain from these dipshits.  Timberlake can score one with Cameron, and anybody else he cared to admit to.  JC Chasez can claim that his mullet helped him bag Tara Reid one night when she was so ripped to the tits that she really thought, and hoped, she was fucking Billy Ray.  Lance Bass finally convinced the Chris Kirkpatrick to come out of the closet also, and they fucked each other.  And Joey Fat One bragged about bangin' Carnie Wilson and Kirstie Alley at the same time while Jarred from Subway videotaped it.  So it's a no brainer and everybody went their separate ways.  But me being the music visionary that I am, have found a replacement.  Ladies, get ready to throw your panty's on stage for the the Gert Jonnys, the crunkest crew in town with their hit single, "I Feel a Boner Comin' On".

      I know that my entries this week have been a huge disappointment to all of my loyal fans out there, but frankly, nothing has really pissed me off this week. So I'll give you a few quickies of some of my favorites.  Yesterday I read about a Judge who is being forced to retire because during his trials, he used a "penis pump" and frequently masterbated. That is fucking great. I was an intern for a Judge during a summer in college and let me just tell you that I have sat through many a long, excruciatingly boring trial. This guy may be onto something. The defendents should hope that all Judges do it because after they get one off, they will be in a much better mood then they were before. And hell, they have that big ass robe on, so its not like anybody can see the aftermath.  And on to the next quickie...Fuck the internet for continuing to ruin the olympics for me everyday. I've watched USA kick ass everynight on TV but there is just no suspense. I've known who wins all day and I didnt even want to. MSN thinks they are slick. They put up headlines like  Guess who won the gold in women's gymnastics  accompanied with a picture of Carly Patterson. Well gee I wonder fuckers. You dont even have to click on the link to read the story unless you want to know where she screwed up first. I will say its pretty cool to have Americans take both the women's and men's gold in all-around. Way to go guys. And speaking of male gymnasts, I dont know why people give them shit. Those are some of the most ripped guys I've ever seen. They could fuck you up, tights and all.  And onto little bit of religion bashing. Some 8 year old girl went through all the bullshit of being baptized and now the church won't recognize it because her first communion food was a god damned wheat cracker. The poor girl has some crazy rare intestinal problem where she can not eat wheat foods (Hey, thanks God) so she can't eat the "appropriate" cracker.  "It's just not a viable option. How does it corrupt the tradition of the Last Supper? It's just rice versus wheat," said Elizabeth Pelly-Waldman. And apprently they are refusing to make an exception because, "This is not an issue to be determined at the diocesan or parish level, but has already been decided for the Roman Catholic Church throughout the world by Vatican authority."  Now these are the motherfuckers that make people crazy. Are you fucking kidding me? I thought the church was all about acceptance and shit. This young girl is trying to follow your faith and your beliefs, which for a young person is already rare, and you are going to tell her no because her body can not digest a wheat cracker. Now what do you think Jesus would say about that? "Fuck that bitch, get outta here if you think you're going to follow me." Hell no, you crazy assholes.  These holy  people would rather see this girl die rather then eat a rice cracker in church. They are probably going to take her rare disease as a sign that she is the devil or a witch or some shit and feed her to wild chickens.  "With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion (thanks, Luke, for that quote). " So, yeah. Thats just fucking preposterous.  And on that note...I say farewell for today.

        And oh how nasty these three bitches are.  We got a titty popper, a penthouse freak, and, uh, a, uh, a michael jackson. No better way to bolster your defense by showing up with these two freaks on your arm.  Shit, just a great picture.  And it took me a few minutes to figure out who was who, but then i saw the jackson's signature tape on the fingers.  I have never understood why that dude has tape all over his fingers.  Only thing i can come up with is that it wont leave fingerprints on the weewees.

        For probably the first time in a decade, I am actually excited about watching the Olympics.  And I guess I was too busy planning my olympic viewing schedule to see that Yahoo was penetrating me from behind.  Everyday after lunch, I can expect to accidently see who won what gold medals on Yahoo's main page.  Come on now, that's like somebody emailing me every afternoon telling that Gilligan won't get off the island tonight.  So for the most part, it is kinda making me lose interstest.  Hell, I didn't even know that Gay Wet Hugging was a sport until I saw that picture above.  I'm all sorts of out of the loop now, and all because of you Yahoo.  All I can say is that what goes around, comes around, and you're getting a bootfookin Yahoo.

        AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.....she lost her dog. True, it does suck that your, well one of your houses was burglarized. And it is also sad to lose your dog. But come on, when you have the word Hilton attached to your name, a $5000 dollar reward from you is like telling a Mexican kid to go find your dog and then giving him a burrito from taco bell. Fuck you bitch. Your pooch is running around West Hollywood somewhere in an outfit that costs more then that crappy reward. They could sell "Paris Hilton's Chihuahua" on Ebay for twice that. Shit, I bet it's already on there, I should check. Oh well, I should thank her for continually doing stupid shit that I get to talk about. I bet she has already been to the Kabbalah center twice and is probably wearing 6 red bracelets now.

        You just can't get rid of some things in this world.  The new item added to this list, along with dingleberries, the guy who leaves streak marks in the toilet at work every day and Richard Simmons, is American Pie.  According to rumors, they have announced to have a 4th addition to the American Pie franchise.    While some may argue that the first one was funny, a classic even, the second and third installments were futile attempts to stretch a thin script, an even thinner cast and worn out jokes.  Hell, I would doubt that there was even a script for the third one.  It was just a one page handout given to the cast saying: "We don't give a fuck what you do, just make sure you mention the following things: Stiffler's mom, band camp, a flute in a vagina.....and eat some poop while you are at it, that always gets a laugh."  (Sorry if I ruined the movie for those that havent seen it yet by exposing the poop eating plot.)  Nonetheless, they plan on making this movie, which is supposed to be about Stiffler's brother going to.... you guessed it.....band camp.  All be goddamned.  That is the best they could come up with.  I can just picture the writers sitting at the table "So get this...How about we take a flute, and dip it in some poop and then put it in Stiffler's mom's butt.  It's Gold! GOLD!"  BUT, this version will have to do without all of the excitement of the original bunch.  And that's the kicker....even Jason Biggs is a no show.  But I'm sure he has his own thang going these days, that wiley Jason Biggs.  He is probably in talks at the moment to make a movie version of "Wonder Years".  So, just a warning to all, that it will come out, and it will suck, and somebody's mom will get fucked, and some poop will get eaten. But you won't have my money this time, for I am saving it for "You Got Served 2: Whitey Strikes Back".

        In what in many people's eyes would appear like the classic Elvis scenario of stealing black music, MTV announced that  urlLink Brittney Spears plans on remaking Bobby Brown's 1988 hit 'My Preogative'  for an upcoming greatest hits album creatively titled "Greatest Hits: My Prerogative."  And in a classic cliche quote, "The cover, according to those who've heard it, doesn't sound much like the original and has a Bloodshy & Avant touch to it."  Right.  But apparently she thinks its cool to cover 'The Greatest R&B singer of all time' because she is dating G-Money Dub Sacks.  Hey, just because your 'boo' was an extra in "You Got Served" doesn't mean you can cover Public Enemy and shit.  And also, I'm sure there is some sort of scientific study showing the correlation between putting out a greatest hits album and alcohol addiction.  Vh1, get the cameras ready for the the "Behind the Music: Brittney Spears". Well, what can I say, I deserve it after  urlLink last weeks post about Bobby Brown .  And also, the rumor mill has been churning about a possible cancellation of the upcoming wedding between Brittney and the #1 Stunna.  Although at this point, it is still just a rumor, and I cannot comment on untrue things because that is shitty journalism.

        Oprah Winfrey is reporting to Jury Duty. Not only did she perform her civic duty by showing up for jury selection, she was selected. I know that most of you are thinking, how the hell did Oprah get picked. Who in their right mind would pick someone so strongly opinionated? And doesn't she have some fancy celebrity induced way of getting out of jury duty?  Well I, folks, know exactly why she got picked for jury duty. Greedy ass lawyers. All of the sudden, a trial that would have been unheard of, one that the unfortuante public defender probably got slapped on his desk, one that probably would have been over in two days, now is going to be splattered all over National TV. And guess whose names are going to be splattered with it...thats right, the lawyers. Look at this golden opportunity for the largest, free advertisement ever.  Those bastards aren't stupid, just sneaky.

        Michael Moore announced that he plans on making a follow-up film to his recent blockbuster documentary "Farenheit 911."  The tentative title for the this project  is "I Like to Hear Myself Talk" and is expected to hit theatres in spring of 2005 in every city not having a book burning that day.  The subject of this latest project touches on the recent hurricane Charley that ripped through Florida this past weekend.    Although Moore is unable to successfully show exactly how the Bush Family could have started the Hurricane, he does uncover the extensive plot that was drawn on a bar napkin, which detailed a plan to have a hurricane rip through several key election states, including Florida and North Carolina.  Moore alledges that the motivation was two fold.  First, George wanted to appear as the strong humanitarian to deliver water, food, oil, oil and oil.  Second, he was hoping to destroy Florida's new ATM style voting machines, which would thwart any attempts by a Bush to rig the outcome in a close election.  Although Bush maintains his innocence and claims that the hurricane had a better chance of being started with a dose of Moore's "funky fat ass fartin,"  Moore presents evidence that the connection digs as deep as the fact that the name of the hurricane, "Charley", was the exact same name of the donkey they coked up and had sex with in Bush's college frat house.  Coincidence?  And with that being said, I expect secret service to be stopping by my house shortly to punch me in the nuts and tell me to stop talking about our King like that.

        ...but the goddamn olympics are on.  So, am I just too busy, watching hour after hour of pointless qualifying heats, waiting for the swim race where they actually give out medals, but by the time they actually show the fucking race, I already know who fucking wins becuase TV hasn't quite caught on that there is this thing called the internet out there, which tells you who wins, hours before the fucking race?  no.    I don't have a good story because i normally grab a lot of my matierial from Yahoo News "Most Popular" section where they show the day's most viewed stories and pictures.  So is this section just filled with the details of Phelps quest for 8 medals?  Hell fuck no.  It's full of ass.  Thats right, lots and lots of T&A.   urlLink Click here  to see what i mean.  (I'm pretty sure i just lost any male who was reading this article, but oh well.)  All of the most popular pics are shots of female comeptitors, in their sport of choice, and how their ass looks when they compete.  so that is why I will have some lame stories all week, because there is just too much ass goin' on.  Can't wait till men's gymanstics start and we can see some of that camel toe action.  Greg Louganis....please come back.  --- ...and on a side note, when I was younger, pre-Internet days, the thought never did cross my mind that this shit was being tape delayed.  I always knew that NY was one hour ahead and LA was several hours behind, but hell, Korea, Barcelona, they have to be on the same time zone as us hilljack Hoosiers...I mean shit, I'm watching it on TV right now.  fuck you NBC.  you tricked me once, but don't think you can trick me again by making me watch the 'Joey' show.

        Who knew a quickie wedding a la Britney was the latest Hollywood craze? Nicky Hilton did.  At 2:30 am, Nicky married Todd Andrew Meister (13 years her senior), her money manager at the Las Vegas Wedding Chapel.  Probably a wise move in her part.  Her supportive sister Paris was there to witness. Isn't that sweet. I'm sure papa Hilton was thrilled with the news.  "They're happy and doing well," said Elliot Mintz, spokesman for Nicky Hilton. "This is a real, meaningful, loving relationship. They are glowing". Uh-huh and I'm sure they will be married this time next year.  What's in store for the Meisters?  A few chihuahuas, double the orange tan and a new source of inspiration for Nicky's (ugly) designer bags.

         Philadelphia 76ers star Allen Iverson received four tickets - each more than $300 - when he left his Rolls Royce in a handicapped spot at an airport parking garage for a week in late May, Clorise E. Wynn, director of the city's Bureau of Administrative Adjudication, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Since March 2001, Iverson has received at least 65 parking tickets for $4,500 on his cars.     Ok, geniuses, obviously he doesnt give a flying fuck about your petty tickets. 300$ a pop is like a fucking nickel to him and he's Allen "I am a bastard" Iverson,  so he will park wherever he wants to park. How about you tow his shit and watch him go to some back alley lot to pick it up. He'll cop a shitty attitude with the wrong person, end up in a fight and hopefully go to jail. Best part, he argued his handicap tickets saying that he had the right tag. Right, you are a professional athlete and you are going to try and convince people who dont make in a year what you make on one night, that you should be let off because you have a handicap. Fuck you.

        The Chinese may as well be added to the Axis of Evil now that they have launched their own reponse to last weeks beheading hoax by the hairy Amercian, Benjamin Vanderford (see  urlLink "Man Claims Beheading Video was a Hoax" .  The new weapon in this evolving war seems to be the dreaded hair shirt.  Pictured above is Yu Zhenhuan who is covered in 96% hair, and claims the other 4% is "all dick baby."  On a side note, just take a look at that guys face.  You know he's gotta be thinking, "Damn, I'm never gonna get laid."

        Although we were really hoping for a September trial, and even better, a televised trial, looks like America will have to wait until January to see our favorite pedophile take the stand.  Above is a computer generated photo of how Jackson will probably look when the trial gets underway in January.  Rumor has it that the defense plans to use the "Sharing a bed is the most beautiful thing you can do for another human being" strategy, and hope that there is at least 1 'creepy uncle' in the jury.  Judge: "For the record, please state your full name" Jackson: "I'm Peter Pan"

        Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm going to beat the fuck out this horse.  Today, the tapes of the phone conversations between Peterson and Frey were played in the courtroom, and it began to be extremely clear just how much of a smooth operator this Peterson guy was...or just how dumb Frey is.    Peterson dropped these pimpalicious lines on this broad:   "Can I tell you how amazing you are? I need a better vocabulary or book or thesaurus or something to find the right words to describe you."   In another call, he tried to use poetry to describe Frey:  "I just started rambling, and there's a tear in my eye, and it's trickling."   Well, I'll be dipped in pig shit.  That line would have been met with "Nigga please" by 80% of all women.  But not Frey.  She was in heat, and it sounded gooooood.  They later mentioned that her daughter, whom Peterson probably practiced the lines on first, was now 3 years old, and Frey now has another infant.  I'm seeing a pattern.  I wonder what pick-up line got her knocked up this most recent time?  "Hey baby...somebody farted. Let's get out of here and make bacon."

        This week, Amber Frey, mistress of alleged murder Scott Peterson took the stand in the double murder case of Lacy Peterson....and already, on the first day of testimony, a glimmer of truth began to peek through: that Amber Frey was a big old ho.  Dayam.  He tapped that shit on the first date.  The testimony stated that he had gave her champagne, strawberries, took her to a romantic japanese restaruant and gave her the shocker.  Don't worry though, ol' Scotty wore a rubber this time, although he didn't for the rest of the times.  He told her that 'pulling out' was 100% if you really love somebody.    Anyway, the rest of the testimony basically showed how she was in love, giving him the key to the apartment and allowing him to pick up her other illegitimate kid after only the second day, and all sorts of other stuff that crazy chickenheads who fall in love after a one night stand do.  But in the end, this testimony proves that Amber's only fault was that she was really easy and wore way to much make-up, and Scott was only guilty of being frank and earnest...he was Frank when he hung out with Lacy, and he was Earnest when he was humpin' Amber HoBags.

         So apparently the show  Will & Grace  was being investigated on charges of indecency by some stupid ass "Americans for Decency" group, AKA: those who get none. They are pissed because in one episode, two women kissed and "dry humped." If I were a member of the FCC and these fucksticks came up to me and said that, I'd smack them. Is this a joke? Hell they were fully clothed. I would have guessed that on Will &amp; Grace people would have had a harder time swallowing Jack kissing another man. This group must be a bunch of women from Missouri. They probably dont let their kids watch Sesame Street either since Bert &amp; Ernie share a bedroom and apparently, a bath. Those dirty bastards. Although I must say, my favorite part about the whole thing is that the FCC uses the word "titillate" in their definition of decency. Thanks , Janet.  But seriously, are there really that many people who have that much time on their hands?? Sure, I have time to squeeze in these sarcastic ass blogs every day, but it takes 15 minutes and it is obviously a spectacular use of my time considering I have 5 (million) viewers. These people waste some serious man hours disecting a 23 minute show (7 minutes for fucking commercials). They read overly analytical laws and try to skew them to back up their ridiculous claims. Then, they have the gall to waste other peoples time by making them listen to their stupid allegations. All the while, these FCC people, who will never get back those wasted hours, are paid by the government and guess where they get their money. Ding ding ding...right outta your pocket.  I can't be mad at the FCC. Honestly, I'd like to be on the FCC with a newly created position: Dumb-Fuck Commercial Filter. I want every single television commercial to have to go through me first before it is aired. That way I can weed out the fucking stupid ones, the ones with crappy jingles that get permanently stuck in your head and the ones that they just tried to update from last year that weren't funny the first time. Unfortunately that isn't going to happen for me. So in the mean time, I'd like to send a big fuck you the conservative decency bastards who not only waste time and money, but also ruin prime time programming. It's a kiss people. Chill the fuck out.

        How is this kid not a crack head too.  but as this picture clearly shows, Bobbi Brown, daughter of Whitney and Bobby, can't possibly be smoking the rock and maintain a bangin' figure like that.  But i'm sure its easy to pick up a nasty sandwich addiction when there is that much drama going on, as found in the Brown/Houston household.  Between drug addictions, domestic violence, rehab, run-ins with the law and shitty albums, its enough to drive a kid fat.  damn girl, lay off the gravy.  watch out beyonce.

      Right Honey, you  definitly  need to worry about what the voters are thinking since it's obvious who your fan base is. But let's all give a big hooray for her awards: Best Hissy Fit and Biggest Blush! Wahoo!! I know that having a 17 year old girl throw a hissy fit must have been some terribly difficult acting. "Oh my god guys, this is like, totally awesome!" But, like, those awards were for like, her childhood movies. Now that she's, like, an adult, she is like, moving on to bigger and better things in her, like, career.  On the bright side, she now has 4 surfboards so hopefully she'll ride the waves right outta my sight. And from the looks of it, she won't drown if she wipes out.

      Let's all stop for a minute and try our very hardest to understand this logic:  I just got out of jail for 8 years. I break into and live in house for a few days that isn't mine. I leave some shit there. I go back to jail for few days. I get out, claim that granddaughter of owners of the house I was staying in stole my shit (an x-box). So my best plan of recourse, being a logical 27 year old male, is to gather a group of 18 year old thugs (seriously, you gotta check these  urlLink guys  out), arm them with highly sophisticated weapons - aluminum baseball bats - and break back into the house (while everybody is sleeping so I can be the pussy that strikes when people can't fight back) and beat the living shit out of everybody there.  Oh yeah...now I get it. Smart idea. What the fuck is that????? And this 27 year old "man" is so pissed over his x-box that he mangles the granddaughter so badly that dental records aren't even helpful is confirming her identity. Wow, it just baffles me that this guy has spent the majority of his life in jail.  And let's all take a look at his crew. What a fucking joke. The token white kid has a white stripe across his forehead and his face is burnt like a lobster. This guy can't even figure out sunscreen much less how to get away with a mass-murder. One has a fucking bush on his head. I just want to know what he told these kids they were going to get out of the deal. I'm sure it was something good since this guy obviously has lots of money and possessions, living in jail and all. But of course, he already has people making the "he just got caught up in the wrong crowd" statements.  Who knew that the price of an x-box just went up from $150 to 6 lives. Maybe I'll sell my boyfriends x-box in exchange for a few lives just in case I screw this one up. Hell, the baseball bat killers might come after me next. I'm not worried...I can see that white stripe from a mile away.

        And while that is in itself wrong, its not nearly as severe as the crime he committed of sporting that 'hair shirt'. Damn.  Crazy part is that it seems as though the police did not raid his house, but the article makes it sounds as if he was expecting the reporters, basically meaning this sumbitch just don't like shirts.

        Every evening, courtesy of the music-loving male sitting to my left, I am exposed to at least 5 music videos. Now while most of them I see for less than 60 seconds, it's all I need to see to have something to bitch about today. I've seen plenty of MTV interviews with rappers who call themselves "artists." I use this term very loosly when it comes to rappers becuase there isn't a god damned artistic thing about them.  True artists all have one thing in common: creativity, the ability to come up with something unique. Rappers consider their lyrics and their videos art. Well let me tell you fuckers something, you are the most un-creative group of thugs I have ever seen.  Lets talk lyrics. They discuss money, guns, drugs, women, crimes and  the streets . Ah, but here is some creativity for you. We are going to call it cash, glocks or AKs, (insert drug of choice here)  , hoes and bitches, murda and  da streets.  But don't worry about the lack of originality there, kids, because next we are going to move on to videos.  Raise your hands if you've ever seen a rapper holding a stack of cash while standing in front of an Escalade with abnoxiously shiny rims with a bunch of naked women rubbing their asses all over the screen. Uh-huh. And for the fashion individualist award, we're going to applaud.... .....THE NBA! If it weren't for pro-basketball players and their jerseys, all rappers would have to walk around naked. Oh, and lets not forget the "ice". Since when did men wearing diamond bracelets and necklaces become acceptable?  In short, if I ever come across a rapper and he tells me that he's an artist, I'm going to take the glock out of the waist of his oversized pants, shoot him 9 times (don't worry, he'll be a tough guy like 50), steal his "bling" since it will look more normal on me, throw the drugs over to Tyrone the local dealer and take my new Escalade for a ride. Hey, pimp juice isn't just for Nelly anymore.

         urlLink Trey Wright, sits in front of the completed scrabble board after winning the National Scrabble Championship in New Orleans . In the final round, Wright played the word '  lez  ,' which was on a list of 'offensive' words not allowed during the tournament, and then chuckled, "heh heh heh, lesbians are kewl, heh heh heh."  He celebrated by going home, alone, and playing some "Porno Scrabble" until he became aroused.

        1. It's Kevin Smith 2. She's hot 3. He is married to her 4. They probably hump 5. Their picture was in the news, not to announce a divorce and that she was taking half his shit, but because they are renewing their vows. 6. It's Kevin Smith  Proving once again, that models think that fat nerds make great lovers, and even better husbands......that is until Jersey Girl 2 comes out.

        It seems that Americans rely on celebrities to learn what is new and trendy. We obsess over items that we can not afford and hope that one day, we too, can lead the same care free, material filled lives that our idols do. We watch them with a critical eye, deciding which trends we can not live without, and which ones simply will not do. From Louis Vuitton to "Tall, non-fat, low foam, raspberry infused soy lattes," the latest fashions and trends always come with a price tag. Most recently, however, it seems that the coolest thing to do in Hollywood is to engulf your self in what I like to call, The Avant-Guard Religions. More and more we hear about these mystery faiths that have the most revered celebrities talking about them in their interviews.  What the fuck is  urlLink Kabbalah ? My initial reactionary answer is: a cult. Upon doing a little reading on the matter, it sounds to me like Kabbalah is faith that allows celebrities (or artists, as they like to be called) to include psychics in their lives and not look like dumb-fucks. It talks about the body and the soul not being able to exist without the other, yet both are separate entities. It says some shit about taking man beyond reason to understand the relationship between God and his creation and apparently it takes the human body to seek these truths. And somehow, it is all based on the Jewish faith's torah. It's a bunch of artistic jibberish. And I'm sure you have all heard about and seen the red strings that celebrities are so proudly wearing on their anorexically thin arms (think Madonna, Britney, Demi...and the latest, due to her emotionally distressing breakup, Paris Hilton) Yep, part of this Kabbalah shit too. It supposedly protects its wearer from the "Evil Eye" and for the bargain price of 26$, you can have your very own "evil eye" protection. Its a red fucking string. But I'm sure there are plenty of teenagers walking around with 26$ red strings hanging off their arms, hoping to give off the impression that they, too, are very deep, spiritual, and above all...super trendy.     The other Avant-Guard Religion that seems to be making big news these days, curtesy primarily of Tom Cruise, is  urlLink Scientology . Here's a brilliant definition of this religion, "knowing about knowing." Hey, thanks for the clarity fucksticks. Scientology supposedly offers the pathway to greater freedom (and here all this time I thought it was sex). Scientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes and other life. Oh good, we can involve aliens in this religions. Bullshit aside, it claims that its core principles will solve any problem as long as the person, or spirit, applies them to each facet of his life. It somehow fuses reality, communication and affinity to knowledge, control and responsiblity to create the greated understanding. Again, a bunch of fancy bullshit that sounds like way too much work.  Honestly, I hardly see a difference in either of these, or any religion for that matter and I think celebs are just getting bored. They all have their gimicks, such as red strings, but the ultimate goal is self-improvement and fulfillment. My take is it all is that religion, like everything else in this world, is a business. You will only steer clear of evil if you buy this 26$ bracelet. You will only go to heaven if you come to church and give us your money. OH, and by the way, if you want to come to THIS church, you have to first buy a rosary and pay for some class to make you official, then you can come and give us more money. Thanks. People will buy into just about anything if it gives them a belief in something positive. I think I'm going to start my own religion. The core principles will include cutting out the bullshit, cussing is an acceptable and preferred method of showing emotion, nothing should cost more than $5.00 (especially fucking movies), professional athletes and people in the entertainment industry should work for free and everyone should take a nap at 2:00. And as a side note, everyone that wants to participate has to pay me 20$ per day and you can only wear the clothes that I sell if you want to come in. Sorry, rules are rules...

        Last night, in ghetto-fabulous patriotic fashion, Allen “fuck passing” Iverson sunk a 3-pointer at the buzzer to lead the US Olympic Basketball team to a 3-point victory over the extremely average German basketball team…in a qualifier game. This coming off the heals of a 20 point blowout loss the night before by those pesky Italians. And all at once, Americans took a collective sigh of relief in knowing that we just might get 5th place this year, which, according to Allen “I have teammates?” Iverson, is awarded with the platinum medal.  Seconds after the shot went through the net, the team stormed the court in celebration and began to party like it was 1999. They began breaking bottles of Cristal Champagne over German forward Dirk “I can’t afford a haircut” Nowitski’s head, telling the German squad “That’s how we do, take your asses back to Germanica.” The team then took to the bars in the streets of Germany to celebrate, where they planned on exploiting the language barrier, Kobe “no means no” Bryant style. And you can only imagine the crazy hijinks that followed. “Ohhhhh, you mean “nine” means “no” in Germanahol”, as Carmelo “nobody else wanted to play in the Olympics this year” Anthony waved in eight more teammates into the bedroom. But, the celebration was justified for such a monumental victory.  And all of this just really makes you wonder that if the team gets this crunk for a qualifier game, no telling how crazy shit will get when they finally stand on the podium and receive that “Certificate of Participation.” Although the team will probably be disappointed, and too hungover to be reached for comment, Lebron “fuck high school, I’m rich, beotch” James will probably issue this written statement, “I think that da ohlimpuks were pretty tight. Greek was a fly kuntry. In a coople of yerrrs, I think I am gon buy dat bitch.”

        So a few uppety political types who happen to reside in Missouri decided that they were the Oz of human rights.  Missouri voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday to ban gay marriage . Who the hell voted? It was my understanding that the Civil Rights movements happened some 30+ years ago. So why now, in the year 2004, are people still trying dictate a basic civil right: who one can and can not love and share their life with. Why are people wasting so much energy on making sure that a few people can't marry eachother when our country has the highest crime rate it has ever seen, has a war going on overseas, is in trillions of dollars in debt and can't get a few million people employed?? Hello, Priorities?  What I really don't understand is why many men are under the impression that gay males are going to ravage and rape them if they get within 10 feet of eachother. I have never met gay male that was half as arrogant and aggressive as most of the straight men I have come in contact with. Being gay is not a disease that is going to rub off on you if you get too close. It isn't like the STD you pass around when you whore yourself out - which, of course, you think is prefectly alright because it is with a woman, who you later knock up and never speak to again. You're right, your way of life is much more fulfilling and beneficial to society then to people who chose to love and share a life together creating happy, healthy memories.  Enter the bible beaters. "Well the bible says a union between a man and a woman." That's nice. If I wrote a book that told you exactly what to do everyday would you do it? No. Well guess what, the bible is a bunch of stories written by guys with long hair who ran around in the woods and shit over 2,000 years go. And you listen to every thing they say? Now don't get me wrong, I think the bible does have some valuable lessons such as forgiveness, dont steal shit and maybe...love for all? Where the hell is the compassion that I hear mentioned over and over again? And I'm almost positive that it says that  only  God can pass judgement, and while I myself am passing judgement, I do not allow the Book to rule my life. So, unto you bible nazis, if you are so religious and you follow the book word for word, you yourselves are living in sin by passing judgement upon others. So, I'll see you in hell you creepy bastards.  And here is my personal favorite, a girl I went to college with, a walking contradiction. She sways in and out of being an uber-Christian, yells at people for saying God-damned and says that "God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve." Right after she makes this lovely argument, she proceeds to tell the entire class how she sucked another dick and then had sex with that guy and his friend. Well this makes at least the 25th penis that I've heard about in a few months and mark my words, I would drink after a gay person long before I would drink after her. I'm pretty sure the bible doesn't smile upon whoring yourself around so drop the goodie Christian act and hoof it over to planned parenthood for an AIDS test, you need it. Perhaps you could take a lesson from those wanting to partake in a monogamous relationship.  Just leave them alone. Gay people aren't hurting anyone, they aren't trying to take anything away from anybody and they arent asking for favors. They are wanting to engage in the same life pleasures that hetersexual people take for granted. What the fuck do you care if they share bank account? The aren't spending your money. Instead, you stupid, narrowminded, useless motherfuckers choose to keep holding meetings at the state house and wasting my fucking tax dollars. I appreciate that.

         Armstrong's Bracelet Worn by Bush, Kerry   Whoopdie fucking doo. This is what I got up, showered, drove to work and got on the internet to read??? There is nothing else going on in the whole world?! Bush and Kerry, two abnoxiously wealthy men donated a whole fucking dollar to cancer research. On second thought, the Live Strong bracelets were probably given to them by their insanely expensive PR assclowns who said, "Here, wear this. People will think you are compassionate." Give me a break.  And while I am on the yellow bracelet mania soapbox. Let me just throw out a big fuck you to all the people on eBay trying to make a quick buck on the cancer kids. There is a friend of mine whom I work with, Mac, who has been battling lung cancer for the past 4 months. A month ago, he finds out the cancer has spread to a rather gross new protrusion on his head and 3 weeks later, Surprise! - he has 4 brain tumors. He is without a doubt the most strong spirited individual I know, a relentless fighter. So I try to get him a yellow bracelet, a reminder to stay strong, and one for myself to wear in honor of him. And hey, why not donate a couple bucks to cancer research in the process. That idea didnt quite pan out. After calling every store around town that would have them.... Sorry Ma'am, sold out.  Backordered on the internet. So I do what every American now does, and turn to Ebay. Imagine my surprise when the 1$ bracelets are being sold for upwards of 10$ a pop. What the fuck is that. That is about the shittiest, althought most American, thing I've seen in a while. Much to my dismay, I gave into these assfaces and paid 15$ for two rubber bracelets ONLY because if I waited for them to be back in stock, Mac will probably be dead. So thank you, "friendly ebayers," for not only charging me 700x the originial price, but for keeping it all and not giving a fucking dime of it back to the cause. I hope you and yours never get cancer...      Random Dumb-Fuck Quickies:    Apparently Pamela Anderson wrote a book... How to Survive Your First 5 Breast Augmentations and Continue to Date the Biggest White Trash Alive. Ok,  it's called "Star", probably because she is such a big one; All of those award-winning roles she has had no-doubt. Gee, can't wait to read it.  And just for fun, Mary Kay Letourneau is outta jail and hoping to be a fabulous mother to her 6 kids: two of whom have never seen their mother with out bars in their faces. And for all the hopeless romantics out there, her now 21 year old Vili Fualaau, who she went to jail for for second-degree child rape, still loves her. How nice.

       urlLink     I wonder when one earns the title of "Husband Extraordinaire?" Is it one who stays with his wife literally  until death do them part ? Perhaps when one loves and supports his wife and 9 kids? Nah, its definitly when one walks down the aisle for the third time...to meet his third bride. Let's hope the eligible bachelors and husbands of the world don't consider Nicholas Cage a role model or else everyone's little daughters are in trouble.  Nicholas cage weds a 20 year old sushi waitress. Think he'll slip her some saki under the table at the reception? But for real, folks, its true love this time. I'm sure she is very much in love with daddy's money, I mean Nick. His leather jacket in  Gone in 60 Seconds  really turns her on and she can wrap a teryaki eel roll with the best of them. Solid marriages are built on these very foundations my friends. Afterall, age is just a number...until the bouncer tells you that your wife can't come into the bar with your balding ass.

         no sooner have the tears on your pillow dried from the recent Nick Carter/Paris Hilton split, have I found news that will make all of you put away the scissors temporarily. Its not so much that I want to report good gossip to you, as to the fact that I was so moved from the  urlLink Real World episode  where Frankie is found out to be a "cutter" that i want to do everything in my power to make sure that this social epidemic STOPS.  anyway, i was watching VH1 last night, becuase it fucking rules, and they had a show about Brooke Hogan, who is the daughter of none other than Hulk Hogan, called  urlLink Hulk Hogan, Stage Dad . She is actually not bad looking if you consider her bloodlines, because hulk hogan is a beefed up piece of white trash, and the wife, who i had never seen before, looked like her resume may have involved a pole at one time in her life, and that was at the pinnacle of her career.....i'm not mentioning the years of being a 'lot lizard' that led up to her big break at Brad's Gold Club. speculation of course. anyway, the show is basically that typical horseshit of how hard it is to make an album these days, especially, when everybody else writes the lyrics and plays the music for you. and then, once the album is done, how even harder it is to get the radio to play it, especially when Vh1 cameras are following you around and your dad is not only a wrasslin' superstar, but would buttfuck all these guys on a 'roids flip out. so of course, she gets her break as they play her hit single on the radio about how life is just so tough when you have your first period. i think it was called "not a virgin, but not quite a woman."  anyway, the show really takes a turn for the worse when that fat ass  urlLink Lou Perlman , the backstreet boys founder, pops his money-grubbin, golden coral ass in the show. and where there is a fat greedy, boy band pimp around, there is usually a carter around. this time, aaron carter (pictured above). man, if you hate nick carter, then this kid will really twist your tits. he is the kid that was on MTV cribs wearing a 2pac shirt, whom is his idol according to teen people (i promise i dont read it) and he is supposedly planning on getting a tupac tattoo shortly. idol? must be becuase of the similar obstacles they went through in life. so they hop on a jet together, and from the first second, he lays on the carter "charm" immediately. shitty part is that its working. she is buying into this dildo's schtick. and later she says "I can't believe I met aaron carter." fuck that. anyway, while on the plane, they are listening to a cd, it could be either hers or his, they have the same voice. and then, in a ghetto fashion, he says that he wants to do a hiphop song with her, and that he can teach her alot about some hip hop. speechless. this kid has balls. does he know he is on tv? granted, most rappers probably arent watching alot of vh1, but hell, if word gets out, he'll catch a beat down. but actually, i take that back, because the entire phenomena surrounding this kid has made no goddamn sense thus far, so i would imagine that he will probably do his next album with dre and snoop. i don't doubt it. anyway, he pisses me off. he just really sucks. but during the show, when they said that aaron carter was on the plane, hulk hogan didn't look happy and called him a 'jabrone' and that he would break his legs and used the phrase "or it's going to be curtains for your skinny little ass." and that makes me feel better.

         Since this is entry # 1, and mostly because I couldn’t decide which celebrity was the biggest dipshit, I decided to enrich your day with two dumb-fucks, two of my favorites: Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan.  I know we were all shocked about the Paris &amp; Nick break up, and as tragic as it may sound, they did get tattooed together three weeks prior to the break up. But it’s ok, it was “true love”…Here is Paris’ earth-shattering revelation about her relationship:      "I was getting my makeup done [for a photo shoot], and it just hit me: I love Nick, but I need time alone. I called my psychic, and I asked her opinion. She thought I should be alone, and I agreed with her."    The no-doubt 500$ an hour bullshitter strikes again. But don’t worry, Paris rushed out to the nearest Kaballah to get her red string bracelet so she’ll be back to whoring around in no time. PS. I hear your local Target now carries the red string bracelets in case you, too, should find yourself in emotional turmoil.     And onto the very mature, very wise, newly turned "adult" Lindsey Lohan. When asked why she was not going to vote in this year’s Presidential election she replies:    “…if you say you're a Democrat, that'll turn off Republicans, and that's half of your fan base."    Honey, the last time I checked, your fan base included pre-teens and pedophiles and guess what, they don't vote. And speaking of retarded, the retards are mad at her for saying retarded. Guess they won’t be reading this blog anymore.

        i recently purchased  urlLink ESPN NFL 2k5  for the xbox. in this version, you have the ability to play in a league of people online. i went to the website, found one that looked good, and requested to join. i should have known something was up when the reply came back from "Pusha C" from atlanta. anyway, instead of immediately embracing me into his league, he started frontin' and give me mad drama. he may have thought i was five-O or something. nonetheless, he said, 'if you promise to play all your games, then i will let you in. aight.' so i replied 'aight' in return, and he let me in. i sign in to the league, and on the page is the Pusha C's message to the league:  "Welcome to the Dungeon Football League. We gonna start this bitch when everyone joins up. Stank on it."  what the fuck does stank on it mean? it's like that no diggity thing all over again.  anyway, the point of this whole story, besides that i am going to let this guy win everytime i play him in fear of  urlLink Getting Served  something fierce B2K style, is that as dumb and ghetto as this dude sounds, i would put my money on that he is just as white sumbitch, just like the goofy buttfuck bastards pictured above. "im sorry mommaaa.  i didn't choose this life bitch, this life chose me.  only god can judge me now, ughhhhhh." oh well, at least i didn't get tangled with a poopy christian. stank on it, bitches.
