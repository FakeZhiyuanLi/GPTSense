      I've just started up a under 9's football team. We've started training on Saturday mornings 10.30 till 11.30.We are looking for about 10 to 12 players but at the minute we only have eight.It's a funny sight watching them chase the ball round the pitch.I'm trying to teach them the basics,they are doing very well first week was Controlling the ball which took them a while but they got it and seemed to enjoy it.The first week ended with the game finishing 5-4 if my memory is correct with tom getting five of them. Second week was Turning which also was very good.I also included Shooting which they liked.It's all they want to do is score goals which i suppose is a good thing Third week was passing.We also had two newcomers to our team which gave us the eight players we now have.If we can get just a couple more players we can start the season which is in two months i think.Myself and Martin who is the manager are very pleased with our new team So hopefully in this little lot there might be a new rooney  I'll keep you posted of any news.

      Anybody been to the 20/20 league game? I've seen a few games on sky looks great entertainment,Leicester did very well on Tuesday,and the prize for catching that six a year supply of carling(bugger). I watched Yorkshire Vrs Lancashire on Wednesday evening,Freddie Flintoff started with his usual 50 off 20 odd balls.Steve Kirby of Yorkshire went for 4 overs 0-60 2nd worst figures in a 20/20 match,not sure who has the worse.Yorkshire won it in the end,with Harvey scoring like Flintoff i think he got hundred???? Anybody been?

      I've just finished a double weekend of cricket.A game on Saturday and then on Sunday it was abit warm.Saturday was a good win chasing 207.My figures being 15overs-4 for 42 (knackered). We knocked them off with only 2 wickets down.Then came the Sunday game even hotter than Saturday!!They batted first and we did well to keep them down to 169 for 9 off 45 overs,my figures being 9 0vers 2 for 39. Simple,knock them off no problem.we ended up 134 all out (load of crap springs to mind) Its now Monday afternoon when i write this and i'm still feeling the effects of that cruel double header.
