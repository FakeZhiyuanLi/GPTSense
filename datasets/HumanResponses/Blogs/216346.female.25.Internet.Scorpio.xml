       weight: 120.5 (6am) no change - as long as i'm not gaining, no worries :)  activity: biked 40 minutes (+5 minute warm-up) my knees were killing me. more specifically, my right knee really hurt. probably should have taken yesterday off. so no running today. but i brought my stuff in to ride the bike at work... and voila! no pain! i rode for 40 minutes and it felt awesome. so now i'm going to alternate days of running with the bike. depending on how i feel tomorrow, tomorrow may be a day of rest... but if riding the bike gave my knee a chance to rest, i may be up for a jog tomorrow!  points: ---- aimin for 20 today!

       weight: 120.5 (6am) -1.5 lbs! - wow! this running 4 miles is really paying off :) i can't remember the last time i hit that...  activity: jogged 1 mile - walked 2 miles ouch. i jogged for a mile... and my knees started to really hurt. so i walked for the rest of the way home. i'm in a lot of pain... so i should have probably just taken the day off. oh well... i'll take it easy the rest of tonight, and see how it goes tomorrow.  points: 21 points all good today :)

       weight: 122 (6am) -1 lb - woohoo... startin this week off good :)  activity: jogged 4 miles man... didn't think i had it in me... but my legs held out and i ran the whole way :) my hamstrings are really tight... so i am going to really have to stretch those tonight. it was too hot again for lily to come along... but i think she prefers the dog park anyway :) if she comes with me tomorrow, i'll have to take it easy, since it's supposed to be another really hot and humid day.  points: 22 points had a huge salad for dinner, and got to have an ice cream sandwich at work :)

       weight: 123 (6am) +1.5 lbs - doh. still down a half lb since last monday :) even if it's just a half pound a week... it's still in the right direction! oh well... i've got the whole week (and no plans this weekend) to make up for the craziness of the past two days... not to mention my monthly friend always causes a weight gain... better luck this week!  activity: jogged 4 miles! woohoo... it was too hot for lily, so i let her tire herself out at the dog park. but that meant i could run by myself... so i pushed it for the whole 4 miles! i felt like i could have kept on going... if i run alone again soon, i may map out a 4.5 mile route... :)  points: 20 points success! got in lots of veggies. yay for red peppers! :)
