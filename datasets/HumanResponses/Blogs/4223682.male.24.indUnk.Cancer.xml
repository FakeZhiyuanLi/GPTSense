      Everywhere was red today... Got ourselves ready and wore red too.. We went to eat some waffles at Compass Point and got ourselves some food and tibits at "Cold storage supermarket" in Takashimaya before going to Kallang. Along the journey to the National Stadium, there were army personal and police officers to maintain the order and show everyone the way going to the National stadium. Everyone was excited.. while entering the gate of the National Stadium, saw a 2nd Lieutenant. I remembered when he was a still a officer cadet, he came into medical center in Tekong for some food, he was on some survival training. Then i took out some cakes and bananas which we had, so poor thing..he had to eat quietly inside the toilet. Okies.. set aside this story.. I also saw a Lieutenant from my BMT coy.. during my BMT last time, he signed on and left us a few weeks before we POP. Lastly.. enjoy the photos which i upload..   urlLink    Ice cream waffle!!
