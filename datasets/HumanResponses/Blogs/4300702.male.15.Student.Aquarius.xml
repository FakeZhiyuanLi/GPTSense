          Well, the title pretty much sums this all up.      Full off gossip, rumors, and he said  this , and she did  that 's..  WHEN DOES IT ALL END?!?!  I really only think it   starts   now, because when you grow up, you'll still have to deal with the same things, maybe to a lesser extent, but..... it's there. Then when your old, and can see death's shadow, you STILL have to face that because you complain your bananas aren't runny enough, or your viagra isn't working.  Oh, and the  fights . It always sucks to get into, or even see fights, physically or verbally, mentally, any kind of dispute between you and your friends, or family for that matter. A few " unmentioned " friends, just got into a "dispute" over a rumor which who knows how, or who started it. I mean, if they all  talked , they could see it's just a  misunderstanding  on everyone's part.. But hey..  We're teenagers!

         Well I just got note that I have to work .........    5 shifts next week :S Atleast there is only one starting at 10 (tomorrow), which really sucks because I was looking forward to a goddamn break for once. I guess it's all good because I'll get lots of money, and work isn't THAT bad, but it's just the idea.       In Other News..    I'll be putting my full site up soon, check out the old version at :   urlLink  http://www.diztorted-reality.tk    (sign up for the forum now, and maybe get  admin  or  moderator !)

         Well, this is the beginning of my hopefully daily blog.     I'll post what's happening in my "oh so crazy" life. Most likely half of the stuff won't make sense if you don't know where I'm coming from, but I hope you find something to enjoy.

         I might as well put it to good use!       Since I have the day off now, I figured I would conduct a "test" so to speak.      Everyone has seen crappy commercials, so I thought, why not do the  best of the best?!?!  So that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'll just watch TV on different channels every half hour, so it should turn out allot of crap! I'll post my results later tonight!  Stay.. Or don't.. Tuned . (what a bad pun).

          Yes, I got a call today at 11:30 that I didn't have to work!      That must be the happiest feeling in the world, I seriously jumped up and down in happiness. It means less money, but I needed a break anyway. I still have to work tommorow though, but alteast I have the day off!        Unfourntunately  I only found out now, so I was still thinking about work all the time up till now :S, I really should check my messages allot  more often .

          Okay, well it was my second day in a row of work, and it was a pretty interesting day.        The Weird   Well around 4, I felt like I was still just  waking up . Ever have that feeling that you just believe it's a dream? Like you sort of think your in some sort of shock?? I felt like that for a couple hours when I got to work. I don't know what caused it, maybe it was the constant calling between my father, mother, and brother on  how the hell I would get to work in 10 minutes . Well, my brother was supposed to drive me at  3:30 , and wasn't even home at  3:45 , so I called my dad to come drive me, and then my brother showed up 10 minutes before I had to work. I was only a little panicked, lol. Amazingly it only took 9 minutes to get there, with all the  weaving  and  high speeds  we were hitting :D       The Bad    Okay, later on in the shift, it was only about 130 people ( it was a world tournament for John Deer ) and I just felt like  crap . I think I was just grumpy, cause I felt so bad for some reason, it wore off after my break, which I spent NOT eating with  3 other adults , oh the conversation was  greeeeaaaaat .       So between the bad and the drunk, the  HUGE  storm tonight brought in a  black out  for a couple seconds. I was in the back eating half of a desert I nabbed from a co-worker, then boom, everything was  PITCH BLACK . Then the lights went back on, and we all smelled  GAS ! We thought something was leaking, but it was the ovens expelling the last gas from the flames. Oh well, everything was good after Chef Carl yelled  "SOMEONE TOUCHED ME!"  just a second after the lights came on.       Now.. The Drunk    This was surely the   highlight   of my night. Well most the tables have left now, except two, and it was around 9-9:30. So the end table had a couple of guys in it, which who have had a " couple " drinks. Considering the mess of beer bottles, and the 1 1/2 bottles of wine they finished off by  themselves . There was one  REALLY  wasted guy, and someone brought a kid in. They were giving away a miniature version of their lawn mowers as toys for the people's children, and there was one on display that wasn't given away. So a man took it down for his son to jump on, so the drunk guy got on it (to test it apparently), and started driving it around. Yeah, by the way this guy drove a  KIDS TOY , he really didn't need to drive home. Anyway, he was driving it around, with me and Will staring at him, since we were the only ones of the floor (damnit). So he runs over a kids toe, then, runs  INTO  a table, and  KEEPS GOING , the leg collapses, and we have to  lift the table  off this guy. Then he falls off the car thinger, and takes like 2 minutes to get back on his feet. Then he did the peace  Nixon style  and persisted to congratulate himself on his accomplishment.        Part 2:     He then got another beer, and started talking to us, saying how good we were on the  PGA TOUR , me Mike ( my manager ), and Romi, just stared weirdly, and ignored him. He then shouted, " I WONDER IF THEY CAN DRINK ON THE PGA??!? ". Then he stumbled into the main hallway, talking to mike. He then called Mike K, a  fucker , and handed Mike P a  golf ball , and  winked  at him, and said " He'd be waiting ". Then, I found out after I was done my shift, that  he stole my co-workers umbrella .       .....What a crazy day.

         So the work begins!    Well , I had a shift at 10 today, it wasn't  that bad . Besides the continuous dropping of cutlery, and dazing off into space due to the wake up time of 8:30 * sigh *, it was pretty good. It was a birthday for an 80 year old, so of coarse they were all old fogies. Oh, and some old guy called me " darling ", not as a complement, but as how you would call your significant other. That freaked me out just a little bit. But overall, it kicked butt, oh, and I got these balloons!!!        I still can't figure out how they got them inside, unless the ballon is really strechy.     Spoon Boy away!  (lol jenn), well apparently I am now to be known as  Spoon Boy  at work, a trusty side kick of Knife Man! wow..... Yeah.. Don't ask.
