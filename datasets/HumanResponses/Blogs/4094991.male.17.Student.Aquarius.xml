						   This is my new blog, since bolt is being an asshole and taking ages to sort out the journals, I'm moving here.  If bolt finally sort out the journals then you can probably find my old one at www.bolt.com... look for someone called dcbio and the journal is there.  I've got work later at 12:30, well, sort of work, i'm not sure if i'm getting paid for it because i'm still in training really, I guess i'll find out today (saturday is pay day i think)... Rag Freak... which is a pretty damn cool job if you ask me... the owner's a bit of an asshole and nobody likes him which is kind of funny, the manager is always drunk, which is funny... Wes (scary gothy guy) is great, Mike,Charles & Bin all seem really nice too.  I finally convinced Kayleigh to straighten my hair yesterday, looked quite good in my opinion... but sleep made most of the effect go away, still, it's straighter than it was... I think i need to buy some of those straighteners... cost a lot though, they were like the best ones on the market at the moment and they're 130 ish i think she said, so possibly will have to keep borowing kayleigh's until i can afford some...  Been listening to rammstein lots again recently... it's so cool, I don't get why people don't like it... it's really great to dance to, compared to other rocky type music. I heard a really cool band that sounded kind of similar to rammstein in rag freak but i've forgotten there name... apparently one of the members came in and told the staff about them and they went out and bought the album, apparently they're rammstein's favourite band so i think i'll have to buy the album.  umm... dunno what else to say really.  Worrying about someone right now... and hoping they're ok.  B.C.

						   yay, my 5 ball juggling is getting good(or at least, better)... don't think i'm quite good enough to enter the 5 ball endurance at the crawley conv. yet... i think i'll have to go next year. (Juggling convention in crawley)
