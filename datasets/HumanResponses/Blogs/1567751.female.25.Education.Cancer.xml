      The sun’s graceful fingers Tease the Brisbane River playfully My sunken soul is ignited with a sparkle As the sky meets the earth with such dancing glee  Bright yellow sunflowers Adorn green fields and my backyard Such pretty things of nature God’s creation to warm our cold hearts  A rainbow in the sky Reminds me of God’s covenant to man Never again will a flood destroy all life On His faithfulness man can always depend  The puffy white clouds Overflow with God’s glory As it rains His grace pours out Providing dry souls rest and recovery  All glory and praises to God For He has given me life and hope My King my Redeemer and my Lord  No more in darkness again I’ll grope

      No one can compare to Your love Patient and kind forever Dwelling in You brings endless mirth No other love do I desire  I do not boast in my achievements How can I be proud   When You are the one carrying me Through times of famine and drought  You rebuke me gently Never keeping record of my wrongs Your anger lasts only momentarily Your favour will be my eternal song  How can I go on delighting in evil When I know You have died for me  I will rejoice with the truth For Your truth has set me free  Seeking to protect me You made the ultimate sacrifice Bearing my sins upon the tree This selfless act I’ll always prize  My trust is in You  My hope rests in You  Your love never wavers Your love perseveres forever

      I never knew  How much my sins cost Until I understood  The last words of Jesus Christ Upon the wooden cross –  “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”  I know How it feels to be abandoned: Betrayed, unloved and despised. But what has Jesus done to deserve this?  Then I remember that My dirty sins were cast upon His broken body –  The mocking crown of thorns His bleeding torn palms, His bruised fractured feet, His slashed wounded back.  As He took my sins upon Himself God’s holy presence had to leave Alone, He bore the pain of separation  And torture from His creation  The wages of sin is death And sins have to be paid, in full. Nothing in the world is free So He paid with His life on the tree.  I understood now Jesus made a choice, and paid the price. He became the Redeemer of sinful lives To release people from captivity Sinners just like me.  My sins directed Christ to the cross It was His love that brought Him there All because of me.

      In horses and chariots man’s Hope reside Such ambitious races cannot be tamed Towards speed and rewards it strives With temporal joy it rides in vain  On false dreams Hope cannot survive Futile ascent it tries to gain Of true strength it is deprived Alas! Hope falls and becomes lame  Crestfallen with colours faint Too dejected to be revived In silence Hope remains Hardly alive  Then comes a light Holy brightness from a saint The Son of God Jesus Christ Hope now breathes again With His promise of eternal life In Christ Hope shall forever sustain

                      Imprints on rainbows –  dark shadows in a brief life 	spoil the coloured years.                   Waves on brown sand dunes –  mark the oscillating days  	of passing moments.	 	 	Fragile veins on leaves –  ephemeral lives on earth 	snapped broken by Fate.  	Faith held tight and close –  transitory prints in life 	are made eternal

      I am into one of my dampened moods again Once again  Down the black tunnel I tumble Endless Groping aimlessly What am I trying to grab hold of?  Understanding? I understand why things have become the way things are.  Misery? I am miserable enough.....or not really enough?  Disappointment? Disappointment with what? Myself? With God? Or with him?  The hard knock of reality that things will never change? Reality. What really is reality? Is all that is in front of me reality? Or is reality something far beyond my sight.   Awakening? Awakening to ......  Melancholy is addictive.  Truthfully I thirst for it.  I frolick in Melancholy. It's nice. It caresses my fingers like an old friend. It is my familiar friend. Never left me.

      Still.  I am  still  alive. I  still  want to continue wanting.  Still. 'Be  still  and know that I am God'.   Still ness knocks your breath out  from your frail lungs Suffocates your brains Tears the oxygen from your eyeballs Enters into the dark corners of your heart And gnaws away endlessly Till you cringe in invisible pain Your nails cutting into your cold damp palms Tainted with puddles of salted tears  It is not enough.  Still. 'Be  still  and know that I am God'.

						   "He liked a woman who played games with the same passion that he did. Too often they were half-hearted. They thought games were only for fun. That there was no point. They didn't realise that that was the point. Pointlessness was the very best motive for almost anything."   - Idioglossia, Eleanor Bailey.

						   You could, if you wished, deny that Mister God existed, but then any denial didn't alter the fact taht Mister God was. No, Mister God was, he was the king-pin, the centre, the very heart of things, and this is where it got funny. You see, we had to recognise that He was all these things and that meant that we were at our own centre, not God. God is our centre and yet it is we who acknowledge that He is the centre. That makes us somehow internal to Mister God. This is the curious nature of Mister God, that even while He is at the centre of things He waits outside us and knocks to come in. It is we who open the door. Mister God doesn't break it down and come in, no, He knocks and waits.  Now, it takes a real super kind of God to work that one out, but that's just what He's done. As Anna says, 'That's very funny, that is. It makes me very important, don't it? Fancy Mister God taking second place!'   ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn

						   'If you are full up, you can use anything to see Mister God. You can't if you are not full up...If you are full up, you don't need it (the cross) 'cos the cross is inside you. If you're not full up, you have the cross outside of you and then you make it a magic thing.'  She spoke quietly and slowly:'If you're not full up inside you, then you can make anything a magic thing, and then it becomes an outside bit of you...If you do that, then you can't do what Mister God wants you to do...Love everybody like you love yourself, and you've got to be full up with you to love yourself properly first.' She smiled. 'Fynn, there ain't no different churches in heaven 'cos everybody in heaven is inside themselves...It's the outside bits that make all the different churches and synagogues and temples and things like that. Fynn, Mister God said "I am", and that's what He wants us all to say - that's the hard bit.'  '"I am" ....that's the hard bit.' 'I am'. Really get around to saying that and you're home, really mean it and you're full up, you're all inside. You don't have to want things outside you to fill up the gaps inside you. You don't leave bits of you hanging around on objects in shop-windows, in catalogues or on advertisement hoardings. Wherever you go you take your whole self with you, you don't leave bits lying around to get stamped on, you're all of a piece, you're what Mister God wants you to be. An 'I am', like He is. Hell's bells! All this time I had thought that going to church was in order to look for God, for praising Him. It didn't dawn upon me what Mister God was doing. All this time He had been working overtime trying to knock a bit of sense into my noddle, trying to turn an 'It is' into an 'I am'. I got the message.  I was beginning to get the hang of this 'I am' stuff. Considering how important it was to Mister God, I was finding it not too impossible to cope with. The tricky bit was looking inside yourself to see what bits of the works were missing. Once you'd overcome that hurdle the rest was fairly simple. My first real peek inside myself caused me to slamm the door in a hurry. 'That's me in there!' Holy cow, I looked more like an overgrown Gruyere cheese, full of holes.  After getting over the shock, I opened the door a crack and took another peek. It wasn't long before I was able to identify one of the holes. It was shaped like a motor-bike. What's more, I recognised that hole. It was an exact fit of the motor-boke in the shop-window down the High Street.  After some practice it became more and more easy to identify the holes...Somewhere down the line it had all gone wrong. I was certain that I hadn't started out with these holes. It was those damned banners that kept on cropping up:'Get on', 'Get ahead'. 'A motorbike makes you someone', 'A car is even better', 'Two cars, and. brother, you've hit the jackpot.' I had fallen for it, hook, line and sinker. The banners were inside of me and they were rooted in pretty fertile soil. THe more banners were inside me, the more bits of me were outside me. 'Most of a person is outside'. You can say that again. Like a child learning a new word, I  found myself struggling with 'I want to be me', 'I do want, I really do want to be ME'.  ~'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn

						   "Death was the gateway to possibilities.... "Why did God rest on the seventh day?" "I suppose He was a bit flaked out after six days' hard work", I answered. "He didn't rest because He was tired though." "Oh - didn't He? It makes me tired just to think about it all." "Course He didn't. He wasn't tired." "Wasn't He?" "No - He made rest." "Oh. He did that, did He?" "Yes, thats the biggest miracle. Rest is. What do you think it was like before Mister God started on the first day?" "A perishing big muddle, I guess, " I replied. "Yes, and you can't rest when everything is in a big muddle, can you?" "I suppose not. So what then?" "Well, when He started to make all the things, it got a bit less muddly." "Makes sense, " I nodded. "When He was finished making all the things, Mister God had undone all the muddle. Then you can rest, so that's why rest is the very,very biggest miracle of all. Don't you see?"  ...........  "Being dead is a rest. Bring dead, you can look back and get it all straight before you go on."  Being dead was nothing to get fussed about. Dying could be a bit of a problem, but not if you had really lived. Dying needed a certain amount of preparation and the only preparation for dying was real living, the kind of preparation old Granny Harding had made during her lifetime...Granny Harding was glad to die; not because life had been too hard for her, but because she had been glad to live. She was glad that rest was near, not because she had been overworked but because she wanted to order, wanted to arrange, ninety-three years of beautiful living, she wanted to play it all over again.  ~ "Mister God, this is Anna" by Fynn

						   "It's all pretty obvious, so obvious that it would take an idiot not to see it! We all know that Mister God made man in HIs own image and images are found in mirrors. Mirrors turned you back to front or left to right. Images were 'take-away' things. So putting it all together, Mister God was and Mister God is on one side of the mirror, Mister God was on the 'add' side. We were on the other side of the mirror so we were on the 'take-away' side. We ought to have known that. When Mum puts the toddler down and backs off a few paces she does so in order to encourage the toddler to walk to her. So did Mister God. Mister God puts you down on the 'take-away' side of the mirror and then asks you to find your way to the 'add' side of the mirror. You see He wants you to be like Him.  ...  On our side of the looking-glass the whole place was littered with holes of various depths of people living at the bottom. On Mister God's side were appropriate piles of whatever, ready to fill up the holes if only we'd got the sense to ask for them. The piles also had names like 'Generosity', 'Kindness' and 'Truth'. The more you filled up your hole the nearer to Mister God's side of the mirror you got. If you managed to fill up your hole and still have something left over, why then you were well and truly on the 'add' side. Mister God's side. You'll understand of course that Mister God looks into His mirror and sees us all, but we can't see Mister God. I mean, after all, a mirror-image can't see what's looking at it. As Anna said, 'Your face reflection can't see you, can it?' Occasionally Mister God sees fit to do something about somebody's hole, He - well - He sort of fills it up for them. It was what we called a 'mirror-cle'!   ~"Mister God, this is Anna" by Fynn

						   "You go to church to make Mister God really really big. When you make Mister God really really really big, then you really really don't understand Mister God - then you do. ...When you're little you 'understand' Mister God. He sits up there on HIs throne, a golden one of course; He has got whiskers and a crown and everyone is singing hymns like mad to Him. God is useful and usable. You can ask Him for things, He can strike your enemies deader than a doornail and He is pretty good at putting hexes on the bully next door, like warts and things.   Mister God is so 'understandable', so useful and so usable, He is like some object, perhaps the most important object of all, but nevertheless an object and absolutely understandable. Later on you 'understand' Him to be a bit different but you are still able to grasp what He is. Even though you understand Him, He doesn't seem to understand you! He doesn't seem to understand that you simply must have a new bike, so your 'understanding' of Him changes a bit more. In whatever way or state you understand Mister God, so you diminish His size. He becomes an understandable entity among other understandable entities. So Mister God keeps on sheeding bits all the way through your life until the time comes when you admit freely and honestly that you don't understand Mister God at all.   At this point you have let Mister God be His proper size and wham, there He is laughing at you."  ~"Mister God, this is Anna" by Fynn

						   "Most people I knew used God as an excuse for their failure. 'He shoud have done this', or 'Why has God done this to me?', but ... difficulties and adversities were merely occasions for doing something.   Ugliness was the chance to make beautiful. Sadness was the chance to make glad."  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn

						   "Everyone has a point of view, but Mister God hasn't. Mister God has only points to view."  What about this difference between 'a point of view' and 'points to view'? This stumped me, but a little further questioning cleared up the mystery. 'Points to view' was a clumsy term. She meant 'viewing points'. The second salvo had been fired. Humanity in general had an infinite number of points of view, whereas Mister God had an infinite number of viewing points. When I put it to her this way and asked her if that was what she meant, she nodded her agreement and then waited to see if I enjoyed the taste. Let me see now. Humanity has an infinite number of points of view. God has an infinite number of viewing points. That means that - God is everywhere. I jumped.  Anna burst into peals of laughter. "You see," she said, "you see?"   I did too.   "There's another way that Mister God is different...Mister God can know things and people from the inside too. We can only know them from the outside, don't we? So you see, Fynn, people can't talk about Mister God from the outside; you can only talk about Mister God from the inside of Him."  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn

						   "Does God love us truly?"  "Sure thing", I said. "Mister God loves everything."  "Oh", she said. "Well, then, why does He let things get hurt and dead?" Her voice sounded as if she felt she had betrayed a sacred trust, but the question had been thought and it had to be spoken.  "I don't know", I replied. "There's a great thing about Mister God that we don't know about."  "Well then," she continued, "if we don't know many things about Mister God, how do we know He loves us? ... them pollywogs, I could love them till I bust, but they wouldn't know, would they? I'm million times bigger than they are and Mister God is million times bigger than me, so how do I know what Mister God does?"  ...   "Fynn, Mister God doesn't love us." She hesitated. "He doesn't really, you know, only people can love. I love Bossy, but Bossy don't love me. I love the pollywogs, but they don't love me. I love you, Fynn, and you love me, don't you?"  I tightened my arm about her.  "You love me because you are people. I love Mister God truly, but He doesn't love me."  ...  "No," she went on, "no, He don't love me, not like you do, it's different, it's million of times bigger...Fynn, you can love better than any people that ever was, and so can I, can't I? But Mister God is different. You see, Fynn, people can only love outside and can only kiss outside, but Mister God can love you right inside, and Mister God can kiss you right inside, so it's different. Mister God ain't like us; we are a little bit like Mister God, but not much yet...You see, Fynn, Mister God is different from us because He can finish things and we can't. I can't finish loving you because I shall be dead millions of years before I can finish, but Mister God can finish loving you, and so it's not the same kind of love, is it?"  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn

						   The more wretched your life was, the closer you were to the truth, to the gritty nub of existence...  ~ Timbuktu, Paul Aster  I agree with this statement. Children with problematic families generally mature faster. My sisters and I did.   The more wretched our lives were, the closer we were to the Truth. Now, just change the small 't' to a capital 'T'. The more wretched we were, the more we need God. In ugliness, we witness His beautiful goodness.   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound   That saved a wretch like me!   I once was lost, but now and found   Was blind but now I see!
