       Creation is something that is probably not true.  At least not the Christian theory.  The Christian Theory of creation is that a guy and a girl (Adam and Eve) were created, and they spawned the entire human race.  However, there comes several problems, such as different races, and inbreeding.  We will start at different races. A white guy and a white girl isn't going to spit out an asian person. Likewise, an asian girl and an asian guy isn't going to spit out a black guy, etc. Now how is it you get a white guy and girl to spit out a black, asian, celtic, indian (and so forth) race?  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. After many years of banging each other, we havn't found a way to spit out a different race out of two same raced people. Albino's don't count, since their gene's are f'ed up. And so forth..  Now we have the inbreeding problem.  First, let's take the example of pure bred dogs. They have the same genetic problems (worsening). Bad eyesight, genetic disease, etc. They take their youngest dog, and breed that with his first cousin. Something wrong there. In today's society, thats just disgusting.  Anyways, mutts, (not purebred dogs) are healther, stronger, faster, and smarter than pure bred. Reason being, they don't have the inbred problems.  This is the same with Humans. If we take the son, and his mom, to have kids, you are going to have one messed up kid (and relation). Now if you have only two people creating the entire human race, the entire human race is odd (that would maybe explain George Bush...),  Therefore, creation, the christian way, does not work.

           Ok, if god can roll a 13 on one six sided dice, it's possible that he is a 4d character.       First, what is 4d? Well, the fourth dimention. The 4d can control time in the 3d world.       Lets first talk about the dimentions (not counting 1d). Ok, how would somebody in a 2d world see a sphere? They would see a dot get larger and smaller. A 4d sphere in a 3d world. We would see a small point (sphere) get bigger and smaller.       Now a prison in a 2d world would just be a closed polygon. Except a 3d world character can just step right over it. In the 3d world case, it would be a box. However, this you might find interesting. A 4d character can see the time rifts. Therefore, he can do really freaky stuff. To get out of a 3d prison, the 4d character could just go to the time where it was made, and just step out of the boundries.       To imprison a 4d character, you need a building that lasts for all of eternity.  Now what does this have to do with god?       God supposidly can make humans have 6 fingers out of the blue. Technically, if he is a 4d character, he can go back into time and make it so humans have 6 fingers. When you go to count your fingers, he just goes back and changes it before you start counting. Since a 4d character can control time, the 4d character could also stop time. Meaning the character could cut off your finger in a fraction of a second.       Therefore, it is possible that a god is a 4d character. God is suppose to live forever correct? Therefore, a 4d character (who is in control of time) is there for eternity in a 3d world.        I might be arguing both sides of the argument, but if god is omnipotent, he can screw around with the laws of physics. However, a 4d character still cannot mess around with the laws of physics.

      The Christianity god does not exist. At least it doesn't have all the abilities the Christians say he does.   The Christianity god is supposidly omnipotent and omnipresent.  If god was really omnipresent, there would be no way he could catch every last thing. Ok, so maybe he can catch everything. That means he looks everything as a 2d world. Humans see things in a 2d world. You cannot see things behind black walls, you can only see things that are in your line of sight. Everything we see is 2d. Thats natural.   However, the world is not flat. The world is round. God cannot be omnipresent since he cannot see whats on one side of the earth if he's looking at the other side. If he did see the world as a 2d world, he could not see everything at once because we live in buildings. Ok, so say he can, he has to zoom in to see everything. If he did that, it would close his sights so much he would go dizzy, let alone see everything at once.  Now we move onto omnipotent. Omnipotent means all powerful. Therefore, god should be able to roll a 13 on one six sided dice. Not possible. Lets see you try. It goes against our laws of physics, and it is not even logical.That alone can say omnipotentence will never happen. Besides if he was really omnipotent, he should be able make something that he cannot lift. Heh, you say that, and he already has limitations.    Besides, god cannot lie correct? The devil puts a gun (literal term) to humanities head, and another one to himself. This scenerio places humanity at fault. The devil asks whether he is the fault, or the humanity. Whichever one it is, he will shoot. Will god say humanity (annihilating everybody)or the devil (make the world pure)?   You think it out. God should be able to smite all evil out of the world either way (omni-potent) so why doesn't he? Why do we have to live here where bad things happen?     So life goes on, and then you think, heaven and hell. God supposidly gives you the chance to do how you wish (he doesn't restrict you in religeion, actions..etc). But heaven and hell isn't really a choice. Thats like me putting a shotgun to your head saying, "100 dollars or you die." Not much of a choice huh?   Hmm, this puts the christian god much at fault. I still wonder why it's the leading religeon with so many plot holes.

      You know what we're doing today class? Playing with the dictionary!   INFIDEL , n. One who doubts or rejects a particular doctrine, system, or  principle.  We're all infidels. I could go outside, and each person I see, at each time is an infidel. So, if we're all infidels. Does that mean there is no absolute truth? Not so.  There can not be two absolute truths which contradict each other.  I.E. There can not be only one true God, and no God/gods what so ever. Christianity vs. Atheism.  If any of you want to argue about that, go ahead and try.  Now, we've all heard of religious tolerance. Yeh? Yeh.  Fuck that! There is no reason to tolerate misjustice. You can go ahead and believe in God, but if you pray in my school I will think in your church, and I don't need a god damned pipe bomb to take you guys down. Pen is mightier than the sword, but the internet is more wide spread.  So, what do I mean by that last paragraph? I have no problem with Christians, as long as they don't whine. Leave gays alone, stop spelling clan with three K's, become pro-choice, and eat a god damned veggie burger! If you're pro-life, then become a vegetarian. If you're not, rock on, do what you please, I am not one to say "DON'T EAT MEAT, THINK ABOUT THOSE COWS!" because, frankly, I don't care about cows. I don't love animals, I hate plants... fucking cactus...

      I had vacation, so all you happy readers get a new post.    Mary mary.     Mary is a girl who had Jesus. The only catch is, she never had sex. Now how the hell did she become pregnant if she never got laied. I have three possible solutions. One involves a hot spring, and the other two involve guys.     Ok, so the first solution requires a hot spring, and a frisky couple. A hot spring's temperature is high enough to support sperm. Therefore, when a couple is having sex in the hot spring, and Mary is in it, she will get pregnant (as will all the other ladies in the pool).    Second solution is she actually got laid. No more said.     Third solution was she was jacking off a guy (some reports state she was a prostitute or a slut). It just happens to land where her vagina is. The sperm travelled in and she got pregnant.     Ok, so that the first part, self explanitory. The second part is,    Now that Mary has Jesus, she goes around saying he is the Messiah (savior of the people).     Ok, so if god existed, and Jesus really was the messiah, how would everybody know?    Lets take this example, I go around saying I am god in a serious fashion. Or I start saying the I am the lord, and I am watching. In the area where I live, people will not believe me. People will say Im insane. People will say Im just joking. If I did it in the Middle East, I would be shot for blashphemy.     Ok, so say I did have magical powers, I would be labled as the anti christ, and so forth, I would have more problems (chased, shot, etc).     So how did Jesus pull this off? You must remember, people then aren't as well educated as we are.     So the entire point is,    Even if Jesus really was the Messiah, he is still a con man. He took advantage of the low integrity of the ancient minds, therefore, seizing control. I'm not denying the fact he isn't the messiah, nor am I supporting. The entire point was, Mary and Jesus was both very talented con people.

      It's my turn to post. Yep, this is Eli. I warn you though, me and Roger will post things differently. I'll go directly at the bible, proving inconsistencies. He'll use decisive logic.  Well, where do I get started? So many errors, so little time. . . well. . . this seems as good a plce to start as any, really.  Well, we're all familiar with that one term. "God is merciful." We know that, or think that. None the less, we also know the phrase "God is love." or "I am a loving God." same thing. Well, here's a little point, if God is an all knowing, all loving, all merciful creature, what would compel him to damn his creations to eternities in hell fire? It seems rather mean, in my eyes. After all, we're not disappointing him. He knows exactly what we're going to do. Which brings me to this point, how do we have free will?  God knows exactly what each of us is going to do, when we're going to do it, in what color underwear, how many pieces of hair we'll have at that time, and how we feel about our mothers. So, above all that, he says we have free will. Seems more like we have fate, to me.  Ever wonder why they say Jesus H. Christ? What's the H. stand for?  Well, we're not just attacking Christianity or Catholicism here, are we? We can't give them all the credit for being sanctimonious bastards!  Think about the Muslims. They have to pray five times a day, to Mecca. Well, think about this. We're having plans to someday colonize Mars, so when that happens. . where will the Muslims pray to? Are muslims limited to Earth? Obviously, this religion has some major flaws. Muslims need to evolve, or the religion will die out.  Any religion, what so ever, with reincarnation. It's well known that the population is growing, so where do these souls come from?  I recall somewhere that Muslims are not to do anything that the prophet Muhammad himself did not do. Infact, I also heard about this debate on whether Muslims should eat mangos or not. Well, why the hell were the Islamics flying air planes? Let alone into our buildings!  Currently, I have seen video of brain transplants succeeding (To some extent. No function above the neck was working, save heart and lungs ecetera.) So, where does the soul go? At one time during that, the body of the animal was dead. Which soul is used? Does it have a soul anymore?  Well, time to get back to Christians, eh? They're quite a conundrum.  Let's attack the bible! Yay! Ready for a story children? Good, well here we go.  One day, on Friday evening, a man was nailed to two-by-fours. Well, it is predicted that he rose three nights afterwards(Matthew 12:40: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.). However, he rose on sunday. I believe I know how to use a calender, so lets count. S M T W T F S. Now, two days after Friday is sunday. What the hell happened on monday, eh?!  Well, you're welcome. Roger will probably post next, but if it might be me. So watch out!  Sincerely, Elijah
