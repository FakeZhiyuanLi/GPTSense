      cement the soul my blood circulates like metal underneath the last nail of your skin  the loneliness leaves me hollow swimming through the shit of chicago never blinking as you melt away face  various shapes escape through holes of your smile where everything means nothing is everything at all  i try to try to read you i try to try to reach you i try to try to read you and there is nothing at all  i love you more than anything and it's killing me inside  you're technicolors! you're more mysterious than god

      you live the life of a secret movie star behind your world of glass you live the life of a secret movie star or is it just your past could this love ever last or am i dreaming again  i could pretend i'm you secretly dance in front of the mirror and you're with me and we're drifting and we're singing and we're dreaming

      why do we always end up back in loneliness or in vermont where the quiet never ends  christmas was killing me the new year brought you here now you're gone, maybe forever but your scent still is here always all over me  the stains are on the sheets this is everything i didn't need blank sheets of nothing coming out of my head reminding me  blank sheets are all i am was it something i said am i going out of my head was it something i did  and still i wait here until i see you again maybe i'll forget and just pretend you were never here  and there is always a scene like this and it still makes me sick when i do this to myself  notes: this song is for christopher moser

      this is a cover of the smashing pumpkins disarm, this song means a lot to me, and is essentially how i became such a fan.  the lyrics closely resemble my life.  a broken boy from a broken home with little or no hope to go on.

      do you curse the day i was born in your bed in the fall i'm the blackbird that caws your death the air when you breathe your last breath  your secrets loom like a black cloud i can't escape you reign over me you rain over me mother, you bitch am i free?  i will not be your possession blame i will not be your possession blame do you spit at the mirror when you see yourself when you see yourself when you see your selfishness  was it worth it the cock of your spanish lover do you feel the love inside do you feel anything at all is there anything in there at all?  do you know what you have lost you will never have it again.   notes: this song is obviously written for my mother whom i no longer and will probably never speak to again.  it was later recorded in 2003 and retitled mother and sorrow.

      notes: an instrumental track with cheerleaders.  i used to live across from a park where cheerleaders would practice their cheers, the weird sound you hear in this song is the cheerleader squad cheering, but of course it was run through processers and sped up to make them sound like robots.

      notes: this song is one of those songs, where someone writes something stupid after drinking too much and then just fucking around with instruments, and then actually taking the time to record and waste precious tape. i also think i was watching a raisin in the sun while recording the keyboard parts. lyrics by andrew gath.

      he had me go down on him i was eleven years old just old enough to know how deep these roots go he took me in the bed he took me in the basement and i said i loved him but i knew he wouldn't  these things i will keep these thoughts keep me from sleep these things i will keep these thoughts keep me from sleep  and john, he was a big man he chased me around the yard he wanted to cut my hair but i was a death rock boy and i was not his son and he was not my father and he took it all from me and he took my mother  these things i will keep these thoughts keep me from sleep these things i will keep these thoughts keep me from sleep  notes: this is really an instrumental song, i could never get the vocal track right, but these are the lyrics that were intended for the song.  © Justin Carter Music (bmi)

      lately i've had these feeling again of death, despair, i'm not going anywhere it could wipe the smile off your face  i know it's hard for you to hear these things so hard for you to see me this way but as you have said some things will never change  no name  when i was an angry young man i had a dream i'd sing these songs in front of a million faces singing along  and when all those dreams are gone i will still be this angry man when it's in the blood these things will never change  no name these dead eyes will make you cry.  © Justin Carter Music (bmi)

      the empty sea is waiting for us the last bag of jane the last kiss and last fuck all so precious had we never had love we never could have lived had we never had love we never could have lived  the empty sea is waiting for us the last minute of boredom the lost moments of trust all so perfect had we never had love we never could have lived had we never had love we never could have loved.   © Justin Carter Music (bmi)

      when i was reading your soul you said thank god it's in japanese i was throwing words and throwing stones to the sea  and glass houses i'm a broken aeroplane just looking for something to fall in to just looking for my family roots  i'm scared of tornadoes i've lived in one for all these years protecting the family from an unknown truth but who cares and who's listening?  ...and in this life of architectual sound something amazing will happen.  © Justin Carter Music (bmi)

      you are the bad taste in my mouth all black breath and elephants stomping around  i'm armed to the teeth and i think you'd be better of dead.  © Justin Carter Music (bmi)
