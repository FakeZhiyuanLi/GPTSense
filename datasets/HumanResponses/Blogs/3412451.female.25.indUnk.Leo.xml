      A few weekends ago, Julian and I went to a party at our friend Joe's place. He and his wife Christina held a party in honor of our friend Mikey visiting from out of town. It was pretty fun. Julian ignored me pretty much the whole night in favor of drinking beer by the bonfire. So I smoked a little dope and flirted with some very sexy party guests. One inparticular was named Ben and he was tall and lean, with a shaved head and a Kappa track jacket. Very sexy. I spent most of the night talking with him and his friends Dave who asked me right out if my breasts were implants (they're not) and Gary. Both were alright guys, good looking but not exactly mental giants. Talking with Ben was a huge turn on. We discussed everything from music to Buddhism to work. Found out he doesn't have a job or a car, his parents bought him a condo and he is 36 years old. Yikes. But he was interesting and fun to talk to. He was very disappointed to find out I had a boyfriend. At that moment so was I. I was tempted to give Ben a BJ in Joe's bathroom but restrained myself. Went home with Jules instead and he was pretty drunk. He passed out while we were having sex. Yes, it was  that  exciting. Don't know when or if I'll ever see Ben again. A bit of a depressing thought.

      Some background info...My name is Aimee. I'm 24. Not much I can say about myself right now. I would call my self average I guess. My boyfriend Julian and I have been dating for four years. If you had told me 4 years ago that you could foresee the future and you knew we'd still be together I would have laughed in your face. We have been living together for about 3 years. We also live with two roommates. This is ok but it can make for some stress. But what can you do in today's economy and housing crisis?   Jules is a pretty alright bf. We have our ups and downs, like any couple I'm sure. My biggest problem with Jules is that he loves to party, drink and stay out all night. A lot of the time he will stay out without letting me know. Therefore forcing me to become a worried wreck. I'm sure he doesn't cheat on me. He stays out with his guy friends who never have girls around them (they're all winners, trust me) and he's just like that. He's not the cheating kind. But him and his little all night jaunts does cause problems for me and for our relationship. When he stays out and I have to worry, I feel like he takes all the control in our relationship and I am just a doormat. I really hate that.  What makes it extra difficult is that I am a bit commitment-phobic. So if he keeps staying out I think "why am I even doing this when I could be out meeting interesting sexy men with big wallets?" But in the end he'll come home, beg forgiveness which I will grant and everything will be sunshine lollipops and rainbows again. Off into the sunset we will ride...
