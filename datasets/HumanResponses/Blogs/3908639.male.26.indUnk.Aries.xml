      Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power, &nbsp;or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit&nbsp;on them&nbsp;and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out, eating right and learning how to fight. So when the shit hits the fan and conflict is inevitable who's side would you rather be on?

      Ok, so it's like 4 in the morning and I've laid in bed for 2 hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not working.  I decided to cruise some blogs and then thought oh yeah, I have that one I should work on. I've been thinking way too much tonight, probably why I can't sleep. Anyway to the point, reading blogs I began to think man there are some really damaged people out there. I wonder am I one of them..........do you ever realize, come to an ephipany, hey I'm a really screwed up person........or do you just think everyone else is and you're normal?

      Well, welcome to my blog, we'll see if this lasts long or not. I've just been sitting in my house in the dark all by myself today and thought if I did this maybe someone would care what I thought. If you recognize the title congratulations to you, you've probably got alot better idea of who I am then most. I've done things like this before and have been told I'm "fucking hillarious" so we'll see. Today I'm not feeling very comical just feeling alone and bored. Anyway that's about it for now if you want to know more, just ask.
