         A Native American and his friend were in downtown New York City, walking near Times Square in Manhattan. It was during the noon lunch hour and the streets were filled with people. Cars were honking their horns, taxicabs were squealing around corners, sirens were wailing, and the sounds of the city were almost deafening. Suddenly, the Native American said, "I hear a cricket." His friend said, "What? You must be crazy. You couldn't possibly hear a cricket in all of this noise!" "No, I'm sure of it," the Native American said, "I heard a cricket." "That's crazy," said the friend. The Native American listened carefully for a moment, and then walked across the street to a big cement planter where some shrubs were growing. He looked into the bushes, beneath the branches, and sure enough, he located a small cricket. His friend was utterly amazed. "That's incredible," said his friend. "You must have super-human ears!" "No," said the Native American. "My ears are no different from yours. It all depends on what you're listening for." "But that can't be!" said the friend. "I could never hear a cricket in this noise." "Yes, it's true," came the reply. "It depends on what is really important to you. Here, let me show you." He reached into his pocket, pulled out a few coins, and discreetly dropped them on the sidewalk. And then, with the noise of the crowded street still blaring in their ears, they noticed every head within twenty feet turn and look to see if the money that tinkled on the pavement was theirs. "See what I mean?" asked the Native American. "It all depends on what's important to you." As Jesus tells the Pharisees in the Gospel, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar, but give to God what is God's."

         You are walking across a bridge and see one person walking towards you.As you get closer, you notice that they are carrying a long rope with one end tied around their waist.Just as the person gets very close to you,they toss one end of the rope to you.Instinctively you reach out and catch it, the person then jumps off the bridge!You are pulled over against the side of the bridge and you are hanging on to to the rope with all your strength, keep them from falling. You call to the person dangling on the end of the rope andtell them to climb back up the rope. The person says "No, I want you to just hang on to the rope to keep me from falling.I am YOUR responsibility it's up to you to save me." You look for something to tie your end of the rope to but there is nothing, the bridge is solid concrete and so is the railing. There is nothing to tie the rope to and no one else is around. So there you are, stuck and barely able to hang on to them. You don't have the strength to pull them back up andthe person won't do anything to help themselves. The question is:how long do you hang on? How long do you accept responsibility for their choice?

         A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted. As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautifully wrapped gift box. Curious, and somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold. Angry, he rose his voice to his father and said "with all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house. Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father was very old, and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things. When he arrived at his father's house, a sudden feeling of sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father's important papers and saw the still gift-wrapped Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse, Matt.7:11, "And if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven, give to those who ask Him?" As he read those words, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.

          "Do not believe in anything (simply) because you have heard it. Do not believe in traditions, because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumoured by many. Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it."        "To be aware of a single shortcoming within oneself is more useful than to be aware of a thousand in somebody else."

         When things go wrong as they sometimes will;When the road you're trudging seems all uphill;When the funds are low, and the debts are high;And you want to smile, but you have to sigh;When care is pressing you down a bit - Rest if you must, but don't you quit.Success is failure turned inside out;The silver tint of the clouds of doubt;And you can never tell how close you are;It may be near when it seems afar.So, stick to the fight when you're hardest hit - It's when things go wrong that you mustn't quit.
