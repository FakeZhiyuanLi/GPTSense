      I walked into a used record store yesterday, looking for a specific CD -- the 1995 edition of Steve Taylor's "Liver" album. The store clerk did not recognize it, but I took a look anyway. And indeed, I found it. When I took it up, the clerk was a little surprised -- he said "oh, thats how you prononuce it -- Līvər rather than Lĭvər" (forgive me for the IPA, think  Lie-ver  rather than  Liver  for the first entry if it helps). But its funny how easy it is to slip on these little examples, especially in a case where the word "live" has more than one pronunciation depending on whether it is a verb or an adjective, and in both cases it is an absolute so that the use of an "-er" or  "-est" addition is really inappropriate. It was therefore an intentional play on words, and kind of a clever one (except for the fact that no one seems to know about it, including the store clerk!). From the liner notes, on the back of the CD:     Dear Sir/Madame You hold in your hand all that remains of a single night's concert performed by  some band  and myself during the fall portion of the Squinternational tour in the year of our lord 1994 so if you're buying this because you weren't there to make an unauthorized recording you should know that this is not one of those so-called live albums where everything has been replayed and resung in the studio except some drums and an audience and even the audience has been enhanced to make it sound like a bigger crowd that's a whole lot more excited than they actually were because this album is so much liver than any live record you've ever heard that you can actually close your eyes and pretend you were one of the paying thousands who watched me sing and fall over every night both of which I did on purpose even though the falling over part hurts more than the singing part so if you can't take the naked truth of a live concert with occasional bad notes and buzzes and feeback of the undesirable variety then go buy some Yanni so-called live record but I guarantee you when you close your eyes he won't sing and fall over because it might mess up his spacesuit. Your friend, Steve      Well, the meaning of "Liver" is quite unambiguous when you read the notes, unless of course you are a prescriptive grammarian who is too distracted by the misuse of the language (and of course the the fact that the whole note above was a single run-on sentence!).  He goes on, inside the non-Jewel case (Aimee Mann hates those things, too -- a hatred I have also managed to acquire after carefully considering the well-thought-out arguments), to define the "some band" which he referred to in the notes [emphasis mine]. And I realized in reading all of this why I like Steve Taylor so much. Because he is like me, except more clever. He has the same sardonic wit (except witier), the same intelligence (except more intelligent), and he has a sense of humor (I have humor, but no sense of it). I certainly don't share his religious faith, and I wonder to some extent how much that faith has hurt his career ("God rock" seems out of style for many). But I can respect it, and him.  I realized that there is a common thread in the music that I like. I like the songs that are clever, in part because they make me feel clever for liking them. As if the singer/songwriter and I are sharing a joke each time. And maybe we are, whether I know them or not.   I'll close with the lyrics to another song that Steve co-wrote, called "Tale of the Twister" (you can find it on the Soundtrack to  Pump Up The Volume , CD version only). The band (Chagall Guevara) was pretty great too, though I think that is mostly Steve's influence. You can definitely feel it in their albums....      She was a cool blue redhead She was a virgin vixen She had the eyes of Lassie She had the lips of Nixon Lips like Tricia Nixon   I stole a sideways glance at her continental shelf And I know she was the devil himself   It's a barstool yawn to a stuttered come-on It's a dirt road rut, She said, "Button up, mister" I shook as she took another look "Have you ever been hooked," she said, "By the tail of the twister?"   And with a brain like Einstein And with a form like sin Up on the roof of Trump Tower She said, "It's yours on a trade-in" (Think about it)   She was drawn to blood like a lean loan shark A tornado to a trailer park   It's a long black car It's power like a czar It's temporary bliss It's like kissing your sister Big wheels and you're feeling real fine It's a temporary ride On the tail of the twister   Big, big wheels And you're sitting real high It's a temporary ride On the tail of the twister   Cars and girls It's the details of design Another bait and switch game That hooks me everytime (And it's payday)   After sleeping with the devil you'd love to close the book But you gotta wonder how the baby's gonna look   It's a wide-eyed steal It's another New Deal It's the whore before the cart My head's starting to blister She said, "You could be the envy Of everyone you envy" It's the tail...   It's a long black car It's power like a czar It's temporary bliss My head's starting to blister I got took as she took another look "Have you even been hooked," she said "By the tail of the twister?"   Recorded by Chagall Guevara.  Written by L. Arthur Nichols, Dave Perkins and Steve Taylor  (c) 1990 MCA Publishing/GMMI/Sadoshrimp (ASCAP)      Every time I listen to it I am amzed at how many clever phrases there are in a song with a running time of 3:21. Its cleverness I cannot use myself to seem more clever (how often can one talk about a woman being the "whore before the cart" without getting slapped?). But thats okay, it is just cleverness being shared, no sin in that....

      I went dancing last night, something I do not really do all that much anymore. But eventually the need to do it outweighs the memory of how bad I am at it now....  I had a good time, and saw people who I have not seen for a while. Someone asked me about the blonde I used to be there with. When I explained that we were no longer seeing each other she said it seemed like such a shame, since we had seemed so happy? I got me thinking about how little we really know about people in such situations, in rooms that are too loud to talk in and too dark to really even see people clearly. Add in the alcohol and the "meat market" aspects and its amazing that one can even claim to have good acquaitances!  Anyway, this girl (lets call her Wendy, just so I can put a name to her -- thats not really her name) danced with me for a lot of the night. From my side that is the comfort factor -- someone who can put up with my limitations on the dancefloor? I'll cling to them like a liferaft rather than risk drowning in a sea of unknown people. But how about from Wendy's side? I mean, we knew each other, and we were getting along. In the environment of a club, most of the people there have something specific in mind. I assume that she thought a "her place or mine" scenario was where last night was heading....  When all was said and done, thats not what happened. Its just not what I was looking for, you know? Wendy may have been hurt, but since she did not show anything more than surprise I couldn't really get into my reasons. Hell, I doubt I would have been able to get into them anyway. In my younger days I probably would have just gone along with Wendy and done whatever, but maybe I am more mature now (amazing how often "mature wisdom" resembles being just too damn tired!).   In any case I realized that I could show up again in a year, and Wendy would still probably be there. She would be glad to see me. She would not act like she remembered last night. Maybe she wouldn't actually remember it, for real. She would not look older in the club lighting, though in truth the club life is hard on everyone who does it regularly. I would not be doing more than dancing and would not try to translate my gratitude for a good dance partner into a more horizontal form of refreshment.   Somehow I feel like I am a better person than I used to be for some of the choices I make now... and maybe I am. After last night, if nothing else, I think I do understand myself a bit more than I used to. I'm not perfect, but I am perfecting -- always trying to get a bit better each day. What a difference a night made!

      Seems like I have been incommunicado for several days. Communicado is a small town, a few miles south of Cognito. I will try to post later with some actual content. :-)

      Seems like I was in and out all today! Reading a book in the morning, lunch with some friends, back home to watch a movie, then reading more of the book, followed by dinner (from which I just got back), and now I am watching another movie. So in the end I really goofed off all day, with accomplices. It doesn't get any better than this, does it?  Well, ok -- sometimes it does. But this was really nice anyway. Some days you have to not do any work. And another word for that is today. :-)

      Published in 1991,  I Worship the Very Dirt She Treats Me Like: The story of a&nbsp;warm caring guy in a society of cold calculating women  is a hilarious book by Josh Raphaelson and Jay Silverstein. I have read it many times and every time I read it I am reminded of how easy it is not to find the right person. Of course I only tend to read it after someone else has rubbed my nose in this fact, so the reminder is probably not needed. But the humor about it is.  &nbsp;  I will quote the book's dedication:  &nbsp;      This book is dedicated to every man who has ever  laid his heart on the line and has the skid marks to prove it. As for the women who read it, by all rights, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. But, on the other hand, we realize it will probably leave you feeling&nbsp;a little superior in the end. All we can say is, the next time you wonder where all the warm, caring guys are, try looking under your heel. You'll probably find one there.&nbsp;

      I was joking that this whole blog thing was just a cheaper way to do therapy. So I guess it really does not matter if people are reading it or not. I mean, its not like I am going to say anything that I wasn't going to say anyway. I do know one person who was reading it though. Someone named "MaryAnn" replied to a posting. But she is anonymous so I really do not know who she might be (the only Maryann I know is allergic to the internet, so I doubt its her). If this new MaryAnn is sane and rational she probably gave up on this blog already? :) &nbsp; Maryann, if you are still reading, I hope I have not bored you out of this blog.... &nbsp; Anyway, yesterday at work someone wrote about a process that I am planning to write some code to try and automate. But I was struck by how much of what she wrote was what I was already thinking about but had not yet captured in the spec, since its just a spec. I think that means we are on the same wavelength, which may come in handy if I have problems later (shes not a software developer but she is familiar with the process so she may be able to break a conceptual logjam).  &nbsp; Sometimes I think that I could really use someone like that in my personal life. But then when I think back to past relationships I'm not so sure... it seems like relationships are usually more succcessful when they are more complementary (and overlap less). If you can finish each others' sentences then you probably did not even need to say it in the first place, right? Thats a sure way to end a relationhip when you don't feel like someone is adding new thoughts and ideas to the situation.

      Today's title is a quote from the personal diary of King George III of England. The entry was dated July 4, 1776 and was apparently an entry that was not unheard of on other days. Of course in that case quite a bit happened that day, its just that he did not know about it just yet. Did that make him a clueless ruler? Of course not! I mean, he was a man of his time and he certainly found out as soon as technology allowed. It was obviously no fault of his own that he did not know that Cornwallis had surrendered. &nbsp; But he was nevertheless quite a clueless man. I mean, he did not pay attention to what was going on in areas he nominally controlled. The fact that the Revoluntionary War even had to happen indicates that. And its not like England lost everything. Though there are times I look at our little band of "slave owners who wanted to be free" and realize that the beginning gives flavor to the situation that never really gets lost from the preparation. So maybe clueless George gets a last laugh for all the craziness that was eventually inspired.... &nbsp; Sometimes I wonder about the company for which I work. The&nbsp;royalty&nbsp;seems to me (who is fairly close to the bottom of the pile) to be kind of out of touch with the situation, buying themselves bread and circuses. And maybe I am wrong here (the disadvantage of being near the bottom!) though I do not think I am. But in the meantime I will keep hearing about everything that happened today was important, assume thats what is going in their diaries, and wonder if they know what has been happening lately? &nbsp; As for me, nothing important happened today. :-)

      I quote some text (cannot recall where I go this, if you know please tell me!) that explains what Rational Anarchism is:     ANARCHISM: Literally, anarchy means "without ruler." In anarchist theory, Anarchy is a society of true equals: having no governmental hierarchy. No one has the authority to order anyone to do anything. Everything is accomplished by mutual consent.   RATIONAL ANARCHISM: The Rational Anarchist recognizes the inevitability of hierarchy in human organizations. Our very evolution as a species, is one of groups or packs with hierarchical dominance. As anarchists, we insist on the dominance of individual intelligence and personal will over that of the hierarchy. The rationally though, we recognize the need for these hierarchies. We recognize that all societies have rules and regulations (not all of them written). We also recognize that breaking them may result in extreme penalties.   Rules will, and must exist. We recognize that. We also reserve the right to break those rules. In doing so, we fully accept the consequences of our actions. As members of a society, desiring the benefits that accrue to that membership; we voluntarily submit ourselves to the governance of said society to this extent: wherever those rules conflict with those of personal freedom, we may break those rules. We reserve the right to determine for ourselves whether any laws, conventions, mores, or social codes apply to us. The determining factor is not self-interest, but our personal code or philosophy. This may sound contradictory, but it is not. If we are caught, we will be punished. If the society is "free" we will defend ourselves to the fullest extent of the law. If it is not, we may defend ourselves with violent action. Again, we accept the consequences. The ultimate rule, is the rule of self.  The rule of self, is one of self-discipline not self-indulgence. The Rational Anarchist recognizes that principle must take priority over personal desire. He may follow society’s rules, but he does it out of pride in himself and his principles, not because of any outside coercion.   The true Rational Anarchist is an idealist. He believes that society can better itself. He believes in the cause of Civilization. By Civilization we mean that nebulous "thing" that is society’s attempt to improve the lot of all its citizens. This improvement must be in the all three of the areas of physical security, physical well being, and finally personal freedom. A reduction in any of these areas is a setback for civilization. One other important note. Freedom is not license. Just because one can do something does not me he is free to do it. If by doing it, he reduces some one else’s rights or freedom, he is wrong to proceed.      Kind of says it all, doesn't it?

      I'm not really as angry as the title sounds. But last night I finally got to sleep and someone called me on my cell phone at 3:00am. He rudely said "This is Keith. Is Heather there?" and by the sound of his voice he was clearly drunk. But there has not been a Heather in my bed since Britney was a mouseketeer, so I am reasonably certain it was a wrong number (the original Heather, no one knew was with me at the time, anyway). So I said no....   I did not even get to finish my sentence by saying "there is no Heather here" before he got really pissed, so I decided to have a little fun with him (this is a routine I have done before, to deal with late night callers looking for 'Sheila' and 'Carolyn' in the past). I explained that she could not come to the phone as she was busy. He decided to get more abusive and threatened to hurt somebody if I did not put her on the phone. So I was forced to explain to him that Heather was busy dealing with some oral gratification issues with me and I was not willing to stop her until she reached a normal stopping point. At this point, he said "Well f*** you, mister!" and hung up.   I swear I was about to tell him the truth but he never gave me the chance. I was going to call him back since I had the number on my cell but I figure it was better to let sleeping dogs bury their own dead so I did not bother. He probably forgot all about it with the hangover he must have woken up with, anyway.   The big question is - does it make me evil if the thought of calling him up next week at 3:00am and asking if Heather is there makes me laugh uncontrollably? I hope not, as I am severely tempted to do it....

      I was talking with my friend the other day. It had to do with an ex-girlfriend (well, whe was a sort of girlfriend. It was complicated, in that she is a celebrity), and about how I had managed to come to terms with not just the breakup, which I had done a long time ago, but also with what she was to me now in the aftermath.   Usually, its easy to do when you say stuff like "lets just be friends" but you mean it in that special way that says "lets be the kind of friends that never see or talk to each other again". But what do you do when she is well-known, has a talent you appreciate, and you really can't get away from her even if you never see her again? Its a bit harder, believe me.  But why was it hard? I mean, it was not about the breakup. Or anything to do with the relationship itself. Or missing her. Or wanting to be with her. Or really anything like that. I came to a realization what it  was  about, though. It was about discovering how to still appreciate her, and her talent. Finding a way to see her as amazing in a more conventional way. And that is what I managed to do. I even managed to still be friends with her, which is also pretty cool. :-)   With that said, it made me think about how often after a breakup you tend to lose touch with people. In one of the more dramatic examples that happened in my life, a woman who I was going to marry (despite my being one of the most cynical and pessimistic bastards on the face of the third rock from the sun) is someone who I do not talk to or know where she lives except thats its somewhere in West Seattle. I know her cellphone number but only for the same reason that I know my 6th grade locker combination -- because I never forget a fucking thing. We did not part on terrible terms, but she went from literal best friend to love-of-my-life-soulmate to acquaintance to whereabouts-unknown-stranger. What I know about the life choices she has made since the breakup does not inspire me to think that she is still the same person who was my best friend. And I have to admit that this turn of events kinda blows goats. Yet I do not feel any motivation to call her and try and change that, to try to bring back that friendship. There is a difference between missing a thing and wanting to do something to get it back, after all. The difference is whether you decide you just wanted to be friends. Because in the end you won't be....  So suddenly I am a lot happier with how things turned out with this sorta-ex. Because of all the people with whom things did not work out, she is really the first with whom I have managed to still have some kind of connection to. I'd love to say its a sign I am growing, but its probably because circumstances forced it on me. The real test will be next relationship that ends. And that would be fairly insane to plan for (such people never find another girlfriend!), so for now I will pretend I have grown and just ponder the depths that the experience has given me. :-)

      Ok, missed a day. I guess this may not be a daily diary or anything like that. I guess the trouble is that I do not always have things to say? :-)  My latest task is to try and make myself more attractive to Alanis Morrissette. It is not that I am undeniably attracted to her so much as that she has explicitly listed out what she is looking for from a guy, and I think I can meet a lot of the qualities that she prefers. So often men wonder what women want, and so seldom do we get to find out -- its amazing to have qualities listed explicitly this way. The time savings alone makes this a worthwhile consideration!  The song goes like this:    Do you derive joy when someone else succeeds?  Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition?  Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know  That it alone does not equate wisdom?  Do you see everything as an illusion?  But enjoy it even though you are not of it?  Are you both masculine and feminine? politically aware?  And don't believe in capital punishment?   These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer   Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that  Loving someone can actually feel like freedom? are you funny?  à la self-deprecating? like adventure? and have many formed opinions?  These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter  These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover   I'm in no hurry I could wait forever  I'm in no rush cuz I like being solo  There are no worries and certainly no pressure  In the meantime I'll live like there's no tomorrow   Are you uninhibited in bed? more than three times a week?  Up for being experimental? are you athletic?  Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother?  are you not addicted?   These are 21 things that I want in a lover  Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer  I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter  These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover   ...curious and communicative...    By my count, I have somewhere between 19 and 20 of these items (I say 20, a friend of mine says 19). And I can be flexible about the capital punishment issue (item #21). So if you ignore the fact that she is engaged to Ryan Reynolds, I may have a shot, right?

      The cats dealt with the fireworks okay last night, though they both sat up with me until 1:00 am or so, something they almost never do, these days). Tammy is over ten years old and Chelsea is almost ten. They have been around since before I moved to Seattle. Feeling philsophical, and I realized that one day they will be gone. What the hell will I do then?  I have "Life in General" playing, and the song "Change" is resonating with me. The approximate lyrics, below....    House of wonder, house of pain Looking out for all the things that I have tried to rearrange Boiling water, burning sun Holding onto memories of everything that I've ever done  Change is coming and change is good,  It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  Worn-out shoe soles, hurting pride,  Making sense of all the places that I've been on the inside Hands are hurting, waking nights Now I wonder why I ever wanted to start this fight  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I've ever understood But it stands so tall, it walks so strong, It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night.  And red-orange leaves fall into love Watching as the wind fills the wings of my very own turtledove  Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it stands so tall, it walks so strong It's taking over me Change is coming and change is good It's done everything that I ever wished it would But it keeps me awake at night. Yes it keeps me awake at night.   So why does it seem like the right song right now? Well, I guess change is coming, though not sure yet from where. I'll have to try and figure that out. Its not exactly feeling depressed but certainly its reflective...  In the meantime, its a relaxing day off. The groceries were delivered and there are plenty of non-work items to keep me busy. What else could someone ask for?

      Ok, I created a blog. Not sure how long it will last or how often I will feel the need to say something. But as a friend pointed out to me, it is cheaper than therapy and less work than adding content to a web site. So we will see how it goes.  Not too much happening today. I just saw the new Michael Moore film (Fahrenheit 9/11) and left kind of unimpressed. I mean, GWB is an ass, but this was pure propoganda and with a lot of verifiable falsehoods in it. I am sure that it will make the people who hate the prez hate him more and will make those on the fence perhaps get off the bleeding thing. But no one who is a fan is likely to be swayed, you know?  Heading out to a barbecue soon. My cats hate fireworks more than pit bulls, so we will see how it goes in the new apartment. 'Til next time....

      I have started reading  The Language Instinct  by Steven Pinker (on advice from my officemate), and am now about halfway through after a few days. I usually read faster than this, but I constantly find myself wanting to re-read parts of it. This is actually very stupid and wasteful as I know I'll be reading this book again, yet there is so much that I want to re-experience as I am going along....  In a way it makes me sorry that I did not go in for academia, as I realize at some sort of meta-level that the only reason Pinker is not talking down to me is because thats not his writing style; he would not in any way be out of line to do so from a knowledge standpoint. His brilliance in a field that fascinates me is at times intimidating and on that aforementioned meta-level I feel a little bit of resentment for this man who has (as the saying goes) probably forgotten more about language than I will ever know. But then the realization that I cannot likely know as much makes me glad for what I can learn and not at all resentful, but then still feeling a little dumber and a little stupider than I was before.  The dumber will get better as I read the book, the stupider I am not as sure about. I'll have to think on that a bit more....   Then (in typical mind-game-with-myself fashion) I realize that not everyone goes through this thought process, and at yet another meta-level I realize that I may not be as stupid as I thought (at least comparatively speaking with other readers?).  And then at highest meta-level I thank the whatever high atop the thing (whose wrath I would never want to tempt) that I have more than one thought track (more on  that  another day) so that I can have all of the simultaneous meta levels in my head, and I shut it all down and jump back into Pinker's book.  Its truly amazing, and theres only one more thing to say right now -- 'Colorless green ideas sleep furiously'. Chomsky was right about that; they do. Especially the green ones. The colorless blue ones stay up nights....

      Kind of funny, but I have been tooling around in this Go-Go Scooter all weekend, and it easy to transport (take it apart, stick it in the trunk, drive somewhere, put it together again, and presto!). I went a bunch of places and got the hang of things quite nicely. But at the end of the weekend, I realized something: the truth is, it's not the most comfortable thing in the world.  But thats part of the design -- solid instead of pneumatic tires, low to the ground, bare bones seat. Its built for portability, not for comfort. Even at that, its 87 pounds and either airlines will refuse it or they may charge me a weight penalty for it. So there is no way I could get something bigger and exoect to travel with it. But shit, at least half of the reason I finally decided to get a scooter was for the trips out of town. So I have to get this little scooter....  So I started wondering --   why not get two scooters  ?!?  This little Go-Go is gonna cost under $1000, even with extras. So why not buy it myself (out of pocket) and then fight the insurance companies for a bigger one like the Victory or the Legend? I got so excited about this idea that it almost depressed me that among the cabal made up of my neuorologist, physical therapist, and the company that will eventually provide the scooter, no one is around since it is Sunday night.   Ah well, I will get cracking on this tomorrow. Its gotta get easier, truly. All I know is that I probably "walked" 15 miles over the weekend between mall, shopping centers, and stores -- something I have not been able to do for YEARS. So one way or another, at least one (and maybe two!) scooters  must  happen.

      Silly question, no? Well, kind of. Let me explain....  I am getting a scooter. It will help a lot with the fact that I cannot walk long distances anymore. I am able to do a lot more during the day and I am less tired at the end of the day. I have the image of that muppet character  urlLink Scooter , the original orange geek! And I can't help wondering whether I look as geeky as I feel when I am 'scooting' down the street at four miles per hour.  But I realized there are three kinds of people:  1)  The people I know whose opinion I respect  -- these people will generally be supportive of the stuff I have to do;  2)  The people I know whose opinions I do not respect  -- these people will probably also be supportive (though I do not really care as much!  )  3)  The people I do not know  -- I honestly do not care at all what these people think. If I piss them off when I am crossing the street then I am happy to do it as the sort of person to be mad at handicapped pedestrians with the right of way deserve to be frustrated in as many aspects of their life as possible.  It does make things easier, and frankly I feel dumb for not just doing it sooner. But it takes time to accept the limitations under which one suffers. I should be glad that I am looking at it now rather than years from now!

      Its kind of amazing, I tell you. I have some friends, who I would otherwise consider very intelligent, that claim there are two types of people:  A) [Ignorant] Republican Bush-lovers (well, for them the bracketed part is implied)  B) People who liked  Fahrenheit 9/11   Now I really must fuck up their little categorization scheme, since I do not fall into either category.   &lt;FOR THE RECORD&gt; I cannot stand Bush, and if there is anything that pisses me off more than the stuff Bush does, it is the fact that Kerry is the best candidate that the democrats could find to run against the guy. &lt;/FOR THE RECORD&gt;  But Michael Moore's "documentary" seems aimed at hammering in the point without admitting any of the counterpoint. Now anyone who has spent time in a court of law (or at least watched some  Law & Order  over the last decade) knows that anytime you do not admit your opposition's points   in order to dismiss them   that you have weaknened your case because now the opposition has something to talk sbout. In this case, there are all the gaping problems in the movie that Senor Moore chose to not talk about. Now, everyone in my friends' Category 'A' will have something to use an excuse to defocus the very real questions that he brought up in his "documentary" film.  Now these friends of mine claim that if this had been done, the movie would not be as useful. But I refuse to believe that Michael Moore would not be able to be just as incendiary had he taken the time to make an actual  documentary  rather than a propoganda piece like he did. Since his supposed goal was to truly have some influence in the election, he could have spent a little more time and treated the American public a bit more intelligently, and had a greater effect.  In my opinion the biggest problem we have today is that there simply  is  no one who would be good for the job (at least not anyone who is in the running).  Ok, end political rant.
