         I made a webpage with my sister's (now ex)boyfriend, and he was using html and making it look so easy... well folks, it isn't trust me. The blog template that it came with was this ugly green color and I used html to turn it into a nice pink color :D and it took me about four days to figure the damn thing out. Now trust me I don't know much about computers, I'm more the *look cute and smile while someone else does everything related to computer* type. I'm a cheerleader (notice the pink) I also run track, and basketball, I took this year off from basketball. Oh yeah I love sandboarding! There's nothing better than flying down a sanddune while sand blows up behind you, and then 4 months after it starts raining (I live on the coast of Oregon) still finding sand everywhere. The other day I was cleaning out my drawer and I pulled out a book and opened it up and there was sand in it *smiles* such a warm feeling. Oh another great thing about sandboarding is gum, and lipgloss! Always a hint of sand! Well good night you Princes of Maine, You kings of New England!

         I have found that American Eagle is the best store out there, I have some friends who disagree, and some who have a morbid fear of "preppy" stores, but it truely is the nifftiest store. My friend, the one with the hair, (Suzy) thinks that I am obsessed with ae... come to think of it, it's probably true too.  I could live off of ae stuff alone, and basically do... I have shoes, shirts, pants, a purse, a wallet, a necklace, perfume, and other random things from there. In LA at ae they have skateboards, and sandboards, and snowboards, that you can get painted and designed by people who work exclusively for american eagle. The ae nearest to me is around an hour and a half to two hours away. (depending on who drives) It serioudly is the best store, you should all go there! *Cheers*

         Have you ever sat there and thought about how one action can effect your life, if you say something mean to someone then you may suddenly become hated by the school, or if you have sex and it gets around then you can become the school slut, or become pregnant, even if you're not a slut. Now think about how rumors can effect people, gossip really sucks, but I must admit I have spread rumors once or twice, never started them.  At my school, the most popular rumor is who did what with who. Or who likes who. I have been asked numberous times if I like certain guys that I have absolutely no interest in at all.  Or I will do something with a small group of friends and I might say I like someone or that I did something with someone, and I come to school the next day and I have a million random people asking me about it. My favorite quote that one of my friends said was "Some people may believe in Adam and Eve, Some people may believe in the big bag theory, but I believe that people are full of shit." And it's true, they are.  I don't think anyone is trying to deny that though.  Well time for class, lata

        Hello all you blog readers out there.... I am a rather interesting person... with a lot of random nothingness to say... but it's random and there's a lot of it... if I make any sence.  I think that every town (with a lake, swimming pool, hot tub, or maybe even bath tub) should start a PBSDC, Polar Bear Skinny Dipping Cult. If you don't know what I'm talking about then I'll fill you in... Polar Bear ~ early morning swim Skinny Dipping ~ naked Cult ~ eh a different sort of a club! Now, early morning also works late at night... such as 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. before you actually make it to sleep.  Best recomended if it's coed, it's funner that way.  None the less... I worship the color pink, high heels, young grasshoppers, and wise sea urchins! I am also a closet spicy cheeto junky, who is obsessed with Maine, but in all fairness I have a right to be. I'm not sure what the right is... but it's there. Sexual induendos are the most intertaining thing.  Expessally if you don't mean to say them and try to fix them and they keep getting worse and worse, expessally if you are sitting on a guy massaging his back without a shirt on. ^^ For any of you who have a big group of friends (coed) and get really bored, you should play strip 31.  It's a very interesting game! I don't feel like explaining it though. Well I must depart into the land of jumping tupac clowns.

         Carpe Diem... Carpe Diem... Carpe Diem... I've heard the saying a thousand times, and then some. But I've never really thought about it. I mean sure, it's a great way to live... if you have a week to live, but us with more than a week of life left in us, we have to live with the repercusions of it. Cause and Effect young grasshopper, Cause and Effect. If I would have realized that around four months ago then life would have been easier. I thought that it was the way to live, and then I realized this school year, how I was wrong, I had a good friend, who because of me being stupid, has stopped talking to me all together. Man oh man, I used to like him so much too, I don't know what made me say those couple sentences months ago. Who knows what might have happened. I actually think that that was why I said it, because I liked him... oh well, I'll never do that again, Trial and Error. What goes up must come down... What about Attitudes, does that go along with that law? What if I die with a positive attitude? Although I don't think that is what he meant. But it is true. Eitherways, it's too late for my taste, and I have school tomorrow.

          We don't need no education  People are awesome! Expessally certain people that make you feel so happy that you can't help but smile... although there are some where you just want to stand there and yell WHAT DO YOU WANT... WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS??? Boys expessally, they make me wonder, and make me really just want to be able to know what they are thinking, that's alright. Now we can talk about PLACES, places I love are Maine, and Arizona. I love them both so much that you don't know. Now I have to talk about THINGS, things are so awesome! They make up my life, the computer, the phone, my cell phone... I love them to death... love them, love them, love them! Yes... well that's basically all of it. But I could go on about people for a lot longer, although most of my blogs talk about people

          Time grabs you by the wrist and directs you where to go   Prom last night was AMAZING! It was so much fun. I must agree with Felicia on this one, there were a lot of annoying Freshman there, but there were a lot more annoying sophomores there. Prom Queen and King was predictable, it usually is. Although homecoming king and queen and prom king and queen wasn't who I voted for, but hey it's all fun.   You learn things about people everyday. I must say Prom was really fun, I talked to some people who I haven't really talked to since football season. It was a nice change from Red Heart Hop, Homecoming, Winterball where all of the freshman and sophomore guys sit at the side and watch people dance, and barely anyone shows up. AND IT WASN'T AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND DIDN'T HAVE STUDENT DJ's.  I just realized that it's almost May! 5 days until May which means basically a month of school left, graduation will be so sad, yet it will be nice, So many seniors that I can't wait until they are gone. Our seniors think they are all that, well some of them. I'm just excited for summer, I get to leave this shitty town. Man I can't wait 2 months of complete isolation, well at least from people in this stupid town. My mom wants to move, and I basically am not totally against it. Graduation is sneaking up on me. I've already been to 11 years of school (counting pre-school) I seriously can't wait until until college ASU all the way baby. Well ASU or MMA, most likely MMA, way to go for Crystine Maine.   Nowadays I seriously can't stand anyone. Some of my friends I just plain out don't know anymore, lets see my freshman friends have been annoying me so crazily much, other than that it's pretty dandy, but I did realize that I don't like someone anymore but I do like someone I liked in the past again, at least I think I do. I'm not sure about anything anymore, I really need summer to clear my head. Well adios

         It's getting better all the time  This weekend was exciting, I went to the FBLA state conference, our school brought 4 people, Paul  Keaton Michael and myself. I was the only girl, but it didn't really matter because the guys were all really sweet to me. I met some girls from Drain who are awesome! We had some majorly fun times! We got in some trouble to, whether it was driving to Washington (Paul Michael and I) or having Keaton in his bath-tub with three girls (with swimsuits on of course) They actually don't know that we drove to Washington, but if they do find out... well we will be in so much trouble. Oh we just left the state after dark in some ones car who we just met and without telling our advisor and having Keaton pay for our drinks (of course he didn't know that he payed for them either) But I have to say Katie Tara Tara Chelsae Kaeleen Britt Paticence the other Katie. I had so much fun with you guys, it was pretty crazy! You guys need to come down and visit me! We can hang out with the guys :P Ciao

         I'm so scared that I'll never get put back together    Yo!!! Everything is so messed up right now, in a good way. I'm living my life and loving it! It's so great. I have a lot of things going on right now, with it being the end of the year. This summer is going to be so much fun! Weddings, Maine, Family, SUN, VACATION! :D  You don't know what you got until it's gone!  I'm talking to a guy online who I used to be practically in love with and now... I CAN HARDLY STAND HIM!! But it's all good, it's about time. He's not very nice. Well actually he's a sweetie but a little two-faced! Graarw :S Dunno.  It's getting better all the time.   I love music, it's my escape, that and something (or one) else, but we don't need to go into that. later

         Fly like an eagle  Summer is sooo close. I can't wait! Not to long until theres no school, no gossip, no stupid people. Only me and those who I choose to hang out with. Heres a cute quote Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are born to manifest the Glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone, and as we let our own light shine, we consciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. -Nelson Mandela

         Have you ever walked through a room but it was more like the room passed around you?  Time goes by so fast. I can not believe that the year is almost over. It is sad in a way, but also reasuring. At least time is moving. I would be nice if I could turn time back and change it, but I can't. I'd keep it as Kindergarten forever. :) I loved that year, maybe 4th and 5th grade. Great years. Don't get me wrong I like high school, but I wouldn't want to be stuck here forever. Maybe if I could go back to Football season. That would be the best thing ever. If I had a choice I wouldn't have missed a single game, home or away. I went to the game that was 8 hours away. Some interesting things went down on that trip... let's see. The ride up was hella fun, and the ride back was great. When we were actually AT the game Felicia and I just stayed in the bathroom trying to get warm. Actually... on the way back I sat in the isle IN an ice chest and leaning against the bathroom door. So all the people on the bus couldn't go to the bathroom without waking me up... well it's 1:30 and I'm dead tired. Ciao

         But that was long ago  This weekend is so busy! My grandmother is in the hospital too! So pray for her, all of you who are semi-religious at all. So today after school I went and visited my grandmother and then I went to Safeway to buy Tori's birthday present (mini-pop) and then I went to her party until mid-night. Then came home and now I'm online. Tomorrow I wake up and then have to go work on sets for the play Little Shop Of Horrors until 5:00 then Felicia is (most likely) comming over, and then later around 9:00 other people are comming over and we are going to watch some movies, and hang out a bit and then go to sleep and on Sunday, I'll be at Woahink all day. Woahink is the best thing ever. :) I like it. :D:D:D We played monopoly tonight, it was the first time I ever ACTUALLY played by the rules, I always used to hand out the houses and motels seperately, it was amusing. I was winning too. It started as Jen and I, Brittney and Richard, Tori and Tommy, in partners and Daril and Chad by themselves then people left and dropped out and then it was Me, Brittney, Daril, and Chad. It was so fun. Today was a good day. Apparently Felicia's bf thinks I'm cool now. So that's exciting. FELICIAS JEALOUS OF ME ;) for unnamed reasons of course! :P Today was a great day! I liked it alot. 1st Period I got kicked off of my computer in the library by ANTHONY and RICHARD so I didn't get to start on my three essays that were due later in the day, 2nd I got to make a round type thing out of clay, it was exciting, 3rd we read and free-wrote and discussed poetry, 4th we made a petigree and took a quiz (an easy quiz) then lunch rolled around and I did the usual thing, hang out with Suzy and Daril and Codi and Katrina and Mya, and Kyle, and yaya, then 5th HOCKEY!!! YAYAYAYA!!! 6th I wrote my three essays that were due that period... wow they were amazing! One was on The benefits of being physically fit, one was The effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and the third was the importance of a balanced diet, all had to be at least 200 words. They were amazing. I wrote a poem third period.

         I don't want to close my eyes and I don't want to fall asleep because I miss you babe and I don't want to miss a thing Even when I dream of you the sweetest dream will never do because I miss you babe and I don't want to miss a thing.  Why are people so damn annoying? It seems that I can't stand any of my old friends (except... 2 but that's not counting my friends from this year like Jessica and Savannah and Sammy) and those two I'm closer to than I have been for a while. One of my friends and I stopped talking for a while, and it was bliss and now were talking again and it's hell. I think Felicia knows what I'm going though. I seriously don't think I can stand the immaturity that is in our school for much longer. The freshman girls espessally. Speaking of freshman, PE today was hell. Mrs. Peterson really needs to be less stupid. Your holding the bat wrong. Swing once before I throw the ball to you. How friggen embarrasing can you get? It wasn't to me, but still. I felt bad for her. She also always favors girls like Sierra. Who I REALLY REALLY REALLY can't stand. I like Paige more than I like Sierra, which is saying something! Those girls really make me mad. Oh I'm so hot because I hang out with guys like Chris and Collin.. ooo look at me look at me. Damn.   New subject. Today I was in a good mood for most of it. I got invited to go swimming again this weekend! Which I'm rather excited for! We went last Sunday and oh I had so much fun. :D We got to hang out with some people that I haven't hung out with in a while. I got a little burnt but for the most part it was way worth it. Actually not for the most part for the full part. If I could do that everyday and have it be as nice as that. I so would! I can't wait until this summer! It'll be so great! Steve and Jeff are coming and staying with us in Maine for a couple of weeks. Steve John and I are going rock climbing next weekend, I'm looking forward to that! Steve is such a cutie! Which is kind of wrong for me to say. But I can say that I am totally totally totally over the two people that I've liked for a while (Cold soup and Jelly bean) So that's a good thing :) Makes me Happy and even when I hear Heya and I don't want to miss a thing I still don't like them :O wow ooo someones online :D That makes me happy! Well adios and I'll cya later

        To my last comment, yes I know who you were. I don't need to turn my life around, my life is great. There's nothing I need to turn around, I'm a  little  confused lately, but there is  absolutely nothing  I regret! I live life to the fullest, and you're right I don't care what you have to say. And when I said Gossiping, Backstabing, and Shit talking, wasn't about my friends that I have now, it's about my old friends. Which includes you. I wouldn't traid the friends I have now for anything... or anyone.

        I just realized a lot of things that weren't obvious to me a week ago. Daril has made a lot of very valid points, and I wish he didn't. I should have realized a lot of it from the begining. I realize it now though. It all makes perfect sense to me! I was handling a lot of things pretty immaturely. I am going to try to see it from other points of view. I know Daril's and I know mine, and I know a couple other of my friends who have gone through basically the same thing.    Afterhours today! That should be  fun . My mother is on this  crazy kick , she doesn't believe that I'm going and doing what I say I'm going and doing. It's really retarded. She thinks that at afterhours I'll go and get  stoned  which is very wrong. It's  retarded . I hate it. My mother needs to realize that  she can't control my life  one way or another.    My sister is a  bitch!  we just got in a fight because she refused to wait  five minutes  to use the phone because I was online. It ended with me telling her to  fuck off  and calling her a  bitch.  She flipped me off and walked off.

         Seeking a guy to be our  gay  friend  We have come up with a cute solution to our gay guy friend, find a guy and turn him gay! We already have one in mind, he's a gay "accquantence". :O Something like that! I like it :P  Wow Mr. Johnson really got me into this free-writing thing.   I love it.  My blog is alot like my journal except my blog is easier to write in because I type way faster than I can write, plus I can multitask better.

        Some people have to grow up, I know guys that are like 21 years old and still act like they are 14, and 14 year old guys act like they are 10.  It is really annoying.  I wish they would figure out that it isn't attractive to us! On that note, girls should be less bitchy (I'm not excluding myself from anything I'm saying) we really are nasty towards each other. I don't quite understand it, but it's really retarded.   Gossiping, backstabing, shit talking.   I just wish all of this stuff would just stop!

        People are so  odd  I don't really understand them. They are very complicated, emotions are complicated things as well. One minute you can be on the   top of the world    and then all of the sudden, you feel like   shit  . You're   angry and frustrated   and everything all at once. I had the  worst day  I've had in a long time last week, and also the  best day .I figure I'm doing pretty well if I can get that out of the way in the same week.   In my blog I try to say what I feel, and I   try   not to edit it, but I always end up going back and taking things out that I wrote. I never know who could read this. For all I know my parents could be reading this. Which it's alright if they do, I'm not saying anything in this to discriminate against myself, so it's all good. Today was a lot of fun, we didn't do much of anything just had a  good old fashion crazy day at home .    Everything is in bloom at my house it is so beautiful. I look out my window and we have  purple  fox glove,  orange  and  yellow  lillies, and a big white bush in full  bloom!    I just realized that next year, not only are we going to be Sophomores, the Seniors won't be there! That is such a weird thought! Felicia will be complaining about Wit not being there ;) JK, actually I'm only half kidding, I know you will be missing him, but I'm just giving you crap. We will have people lower than us, and offically be allowed in the mall, not that I haven't eaten lunch numerous times in the mall. I think it's stupid that Freshman can't go into the mall, next year it will be something else, the incoming Freshman are quite annoying ^o). Well I think I've written enough for right now.

We took a bath in the lake are wearing cute tubtops and skirts, matching mix-matched swim suits, and are heading out to the dunes to have   hardcore boarding, sun, sand, and fun times!    I love the summer , I love   coloages!   I love staying up to unbelieve hours being   fricken hyper   and making  no sense , laying in bed staying up until my mom goes to work because it made sense to me!

          Life  is an opportunity, benefit from it.    Life  is beauty, admire it.   Life  is a dream, realize it.   Life  is a challenge, meet it.   Life  is a duty, complete it.   Life  is a game, play it.   Life  is a promise, fulfill it.   Life  is a sorrow, overcome it.   Life  is a song, sing it.   Life  is a struggle, accept it.   Life  is a tragedy, confront it.   Life  is an adventure, dare it.   Life  is luck, make it.   Life  is too precious, do not destro it.   Life  is life, fight for it.    Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.     Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.     A person's true wealth is the good he or she does in the world

         You gave me life and set me free and then you walked away from me  That title is fits well because someone just did the same thing to me, except he's seeing someone else, and decided that by ignoring me it would hurt me less than actually just telling me. Guys need to figure somethings out. I don't understand how anyone could think that it's fine to lead someone on so much and date them, but consider to be doing things with them after they broke up, saying, "I want us to act like we are dating without the title" and then he starts seeing someone else, but it doesn't matter because I was just one of his flings. So now instead of being friends, we are now accquantences. I really couldn't care less. Haha Felicia just sent me song lyrics from a song that fit also.   Sometimes I  Need to  remember just to breathe   Sometimes I  Need you to  stay away from me   Sometimes I'm   In disbelief  I didn't know  Somehow I   Need you to go    Sometimes I  Feel like I  trusted you  too well  Sometimes I  Just  feel like screaming  at myself  Sometimes I'm   In Disbelief  I didn't know  Somehow I   Need to be alone     Don't stay    Forget our  memories   Forget our  possibilities  What  you were changing me  into  [Just give me myself back and]   Don't stay    Forget our  memories   Forget our  possibilities  Take all your  faithlessness  with you  [Just  give me myself back  and]   Don't Stay     I don't  need you anymore   I don't  want to be ignored   I don't  need one more day  Of you wasting me away  With no apologies   Alright enough venting for right now ciao!

         Here comes the bride  My sister got married today!! It was sooo beautiful. It was such a blast. The ceremony too play at sundown outside (It's in Nevada so it's really warm) and then after they exchanged vows we all went inside for the reception we ate, did a money dance, tossed the garder (one of the groomsmen caught it) and tossed the brides bouquet (I caught it :O) then I met some of Tony's (my now brother-in-law) cousins, they are great! They are around 15-18 and hilarious. Deanna is one I got along with the best, she's a sweetheart. ITALIANS ARE THE GREATEST! Before the wedding we all went over to Janisha's house and got out hair done and our make-up and hung out for 6 and a half hours with all the girls in the bridal party and related. It was great. And now here I am, in my sisters room, while she's driving to the airport to go on her hunnymoon with her hunny. We just got home frm the wedding. It was amazing. It made me realize, that I really don't need to be home, or around guys to have fun. I was talking to Carrie (one of my sister's brides maids) about being tall (she's 6'1) and we were talking about how people make rude comments and how she always has come backs for them, well at the wedding Carrie and I were standing next to each other (I'm 5'10 so not exactly short) and a guy comes up to us and says, oh look it's the twin towers, and carrie looks at him and says well these towers aren't going to fall, and walks off. It was awesome! haha Ciao bed time!

         The world is round... it turns on me  This summer has been so fun, there hasnt been a day where I haven't done SOMETHING, whether it's bonfires, or having people spend the night, or break open glow sticks and spray them around the room and prance around. It's all so much fun! We are going to have a bon fire tonight I believe... if I can go. Maia and I have been talking alot lately, it's a lot of fun. She's in Portland which sucks, her dad wants her to move there for all of the summer and all of next year which would SUCK. She's a lot of fun! Suzy needs to bring her duck or turtle out tonight, they are so cute :) But ya know. Wow a dead girl on TV imagine that, it seems that is all that is on TV lately... murders, crimes, sex.   SEX DRUGS & ALCOHOL... THEY ARE BAD!    Things are so weird lately. Ashlyn is basically in love (well really strong lust) with a guy, Fel and Wit... Juju and Josh.. Shelly and the other Josh... and Suzy and I don't have or like anyone (well I dont really like anyone...) but well... haha nevermind. Summer is the time to relax, Summer is the time to hang out, Summer is the time to have fun in the sun and get laid in the shade JK :P (sorta) Ciao

         Felicia I'm sorry!  Felicia that was a stupid thing for me too say, I understand why you are upset. I did talk to you about it though. I just told you what I felt, and I don't know what it was like between you and James, and I don't know what it's like between you and Anthony. For all I know it could be the same thing. You act on the outside the same, you don't always let me in to know what you truely are thinking or feeling. With James, as you stated, you always said I miss James, and maybe you were just trying to convince yourself that, but I didn't know that, and it fooled me the first time, so how was I to know that it just wasn't fooling me this time too. I was just concerned about you, that's all. I just want you too know that. I don't want you to get hurt again. I am sooo sorry, like more than you can imagine for saying what I did, I only want you to be aware of everything unlike you were before. So my  DEEPEST  apologies! I am  truely  sorry. If there's anything I can do to make up for it, well just let me know! Love you always! Joso

         All you wanted was somebody who cares  Today was rather boring. I gave my hair a hot oil treatment, and took a shower for like an hour and a half... well at least until our hot water ran out and then I just took a cold shower for about 15 minutes, so ya know. I've been online  way  too much today. I wish I had something to do, but I'm stranded at home, and nobody is here, and I don't my license so I'm stuck! Well I don't really have anything to say. I need to free-write for Johnson's class as well. So Ciao

         As we go on, we remember all the times we've had together, and as our lives change from whatever we will still be friends forever  Graduation was so sad! I cried during Laurel's speach, I couldn't believe how sad it was. Felicia and I were close to tears the whole time. I cried afterwards, someone I like so much came up and gave me a hug and as soon as we walked away I started crying! Today I cried too. Jennifer and I were talking about how pretty soon we were going to be up there getting our diploma's and being done with high school, and how we will never have the same group of people in this school ever again. My friends are the world to me right now. I don't know what I would do without them. It's even worth the stupid gossip that goes around our school. I don't care anymore, I have realized that people will say what they want to say and I shouldn't care about it because even if it's not true it's going to be said eitherways. We were trying to have a bonfire today although I didn't even try to go... I'll just have to call them and tell them that I won't be out there, they can go if they want to.  I think I want to go to ASU. I love Arizona... but I also love Maine... I don't know where I am going to go, but I can garentee that it will be one of those two places. I am not even going to think about it until I am a junior, I mean hell, I have 3 years to worry about this. I am going to stop stressing the small stuff! :) CARPE DIEM! Sieze the day... for tomorrow we die! Ciao

         Headstrong to take on anyone  Graduation tonight! It's exciting. It's also really sad! Last night was so fun, Felicia came over and we took millions of pictures then got online and started messing with Paul. It was so fun! Jeremy and I broke up last week. That's alright, it's for the best. PE was so much fun! We played softball but there's only 3 batters and when a batter gets out she goes to left feild and everyone rotates and the pitcher goes to bad It's great! I'm really hot right now. At lunch we got into a paint fight it was so much fun! It got all over my sweat shirt though. Felicia is comming over andwe're going swimming and getting ready for graduation, it should be a lot of fun =) Felza and I always amuze ourselves, It's great! Well we're watchign a movie so ciao!

         Don't make excuses, don't ask why  It's JUNE! Which means that we have 7 days of school left! Tomorrow is my math final! I am FREAKING OUT! Oh god, I am going to die! I have a C in his class and I still have 4 test grades left. Skills test, Test #7, and the final is worth 2 test grades, and they all have to be done by tomorrow. My tests grades are 51, 56, 83, 86, & 93, which is a 73.8 average. I hate math so much. Tonight is totally dedicated to Studying math, so is Study Hall tomorrow, and part of language, and lunch. Then it's PE & Math! I've been gone for so long and when I got back the teachers I eneded to talk to were gone, Interesting eh? So now it's Tuesday and block day is tomorrow, lab due on Thursday.

         You said you wanted to make up, but it's time to break up  Well yesterday I stopped by the LAN party, that was a trip! 5 girls 23 guys, 3 of the girls (Millie Ashlyn and I) were only there for around 10 minutes, so 2 girls (Suzy and Amanda) yeah crazy times. People are so crazily awesome! I can't wait until summer! I am going to have so much fun! I have to go to play practice today, in like 25 minutes, I think I'm going to go in PJ's all I care about is comfort! Poor __... it's halfway her own fault when anything gets semi serious she pushes him away. But goodness, sleeping with one person and making out with three people. I look like such a bum right now. Play practice is so time consuming! Tomorrow before school and after school and wednesday before and after school I have to go in for math and PE. Which also means Thurdsay before school. Well play practice awaits. Ciao

It was with all the church youth group. There was about one-hundred people there. So crazy! It's so nice not to have to worry about track. There's more time to do homeowrk. Such a relief. Actually, it's not like I do much homework at home. My 1st period study hall gets didicated for that. Well it's 4:15 in the morning and I am so tired! Ciao

         Whatever happened to predictablity, the milkman, the paperboy, evening TV  I think I have a new love interest. Now quite sure though. He's cute and nice! :P He's blonde, that that it really matters Moi (my last interest) was a little angry with us earlier this week because we were playing wallball and we didn't let him play (hehe Suze)and he went over to one of our mutual friends and started freaking out about it, saying, "Oh she's over there playing wallball with HIM!" (BTW wallball isn't played with a wall and a ball it's something different) Moi and Mini are friends, I actually only met Mini because of Moi. +) Wow Ashlyn and I have been hanging out so much lately... last week on Friday and Saturday, and Today and Tomorrow. Suzy and I have been hanging out hard core also! Same with me and Felicia. Hard core chillin' with all of my friends! Old and new. People are so crazy! Being a teenager is so much fun! I only wish I was a little bit older... maybe 16? Ciao

         Why can't I bring you into my life  I'm watching Jaws. It's exciting! It is movies like this one that makes me paranoid! Afraid of things like the water, snakes, spiders, the dark, or just being alone. Well I am afraid of the dark, only when I'm outside alone. When I'm home alone and hear noises... that's creepy, unless I'm on the phone or talking to someone online or if it's mid-day like anywhere from 6 in the morning until like 9 at night. I am afraid of heights if there is a chance for me to fall. I don't mind airplanes or tree houses or things like that, but I don't like cliffs or canyons. The bonfire was so awesome hehe! We had two fires one was mine Ashlyn and Codi's and the other bonfire was Amanda, Erin and John's and we were sneaking around comando style, on our knees and army craling or rolling, so the other thre wouldn't see us. Then we would try to wreck the other's fire. It was such great fun! My dad won't let me drive with any teenagers. It's so stupid! One year and three months (to the day) until I can drive myself where I want to go! Suze and I made up a song! Jizzel fo' shizzel in da hot tub my nizzle, and there's a second verse but I don't really remember it ^-^ Suzy and i are starting a nudest colong! It's great! PBSDC all the way! Clothes such hard core! I'm going Nike, Nike, Italy, France.... Romance! Does time truely exist? I mean how do you know, there will never be a final number. If there is such thing as infeinety than there can not possibly be a final number because infenity never ends! Well I believe I shall call it a night adios! Ciao... Actually never mind about bed this movie just became interesting! Ahh it's so scary! Queer eye for the straight guy is such an amazing show! Guys really need tohave some help dressing! Next year I want to run xc but I know I can't physically cuz of my knees... I feel bad but oh well. I'm going to do cheerleadign and track! Yippie!

         You don't know where you met me, you don't know why. You can't turn around and say goodbye  Well we had a bonfire! It was fun even though only like 6 people went at frist. Ashlyn, Erin, Amanda, Codi, John, and I. It was fun! I finished 1984 last week (well 2 weeks ago) Now I'm half way through Stephen Kind's "It" ;) Sorta I was sick on Tuesday and Wednesday so all I did was read. On Sunday all I did was read as well. Seniors are gone now. It's rather sad. Well in some ways it's good in others it's bad. I have just became pretty good friends with some seniors. 8 days of school left! Wednesday before school I have to go in and take a math test. Tuesday before and after school I have to take skills tests. I have to pass them. I have an 87.5% in Biology =) Suzy and I made a list of people that we want to do random things with before summer is over, I got one of them done last night! uh oh I forgot to grab the lighter fliud bottle. I'll have Codi bring it to me on Tuesday. The coast guards told my dad that a tall girl with long brown hair and two other girls were sitting on the side of the road. Oh and she was wearing grey sweats... yeah I was wearing grey sweats, cute isn't it? I don't think so because it wasn't me! RAWR. 1984 is a very screwed up book. It really makes you think. The government could someday become this controlling! Today I've eaten a breakfast burrito and a bar of schocolate and it's not midnight. My dad and Bonnie only caught two crabs. Wow to think that they spent around four hours crabbing. Crazy. My dog smells like flee dip. Next week should be awesome! Other than math finals... Felicia and I can hang out hard core! Anthony's school year is over and Sarah will be gone... some where... not sure where though. I don't really care. Sierra yelled at her in PE class, it was funny. I think I'll go eat something now.

       Well now is the time I have to decide whether I want to go home on the 10th or later then that... I am pushing more towards the 31st... I wanted to go home really badly about a week ago, but I've been hanging out with Michaela a lot. Meeting new people.. a lot of guys, really cute guys. I have to decide by Friday whether I want to stay or whether I want to go. I went downtown last night and hung out with everyone. Met some new people; Stacy (who reminds me soo much of Arianna) Beef, Helms, Chelsey, Aaron, Travis, I saw Chad again.. hmm there were like 5 others girls and 4 other guys that I don't remember their names... but yeah.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun like always. I went skiing and wakeboarding with Michaela's mother, her bf&nbsp;Chris, my mom, Shannon, (her sister) and her cousin John... Michaela was sick. John is 16 and Shannon is 24 and it was John and my first time skiing/wakeboarding. Wow it was very intertaining.  "OH SHIT"  haha. I want to stay really badly, but if there was any possibility back in Florence... I would be there in a second. I don't know why, but I just want that alot. Felicia, Suzy, Tori, and Katrina told me that they&nbsp;want me to come back, Jennifer thinks I should leave on like the 22nd. I'm not sure what I am going to do... I might come back onm the 10th.. I truely have no idea what's going to happen, let's see what we can make happen ^^. Well I g2g Ciao

        Last night was really fun, Michaela came and picked me up at 7:30 and we went up to IGA and met up with her friends Shawn... and two of his friends, then we went up to the three corners and were going to meet them up there, and they weren't there and we saw tire tracks going up to the tower and as stupid as we were, we decided that they probably went all the way up there, so we followed. We were going a little too fast for that road, expessally in Gales new car.&nbsp; We heard a big clank and really thought that we dented it. We went back to town, looked at the car made sure that it wasn't hurt (it was just a little muddy). We parked the car in IGA and walked downtown, and met up with BJ and a bunch of his friends. BJ is Michaela's cousin, and he looks at me and says...   How do you know Michaela... you're not related are you?   I told him that we weren't and he said,   just making sure we aren't related  . Then he asked me how old I was and I told him I was 14, and he said   WHAT IS IT WITH GIRLS LOOKING 25.. (he's 19) pretend you didn't tell me that... so how old are you again?   I said,   oh yeah I'm 25, I lyed  , he said   I KNEW IT.   It was great. I met just about everyone in town. One was a&nbsp; guy named Chad who reminded me of someone but I don't really know who, he was really cute. Michaela introduced us, and he was shaking my hand and he didn't let go for a while, and Michaela turned to him and said...   She's staying in Millinocket all summer  . &nbsp;  A guy named Garrett was having a party at his house, and one of the girls came back from his house and said,   they are all tokin it up over there  ,   all of the guys run to their cars and said lets go! And all went to go get stoned. We asked Craig (such a hottie) to give us a ride to our car up and so michaela and I piled in and headed back to our car. We went back downtown, and hung out with the other people down there. Michaela, Kyle and I were sitting on the bench and Chad came back and sat next to me, and we all were just hanging out talking, and Felicia called me and her ring tone is headstrong and Chad started singing along, it was great. My ass is bruised from last night. I said something stupid and Chad was making fun of me and I pushed him in a joking way and he pushed me back and I pushed him back and he shoved me off of the bench, and Craig says,   You can't push her!!   It was alot of fun. I got home around 11 or so. Felicia is acting weird today... like she's annoyed at me or something. At first I was supposed to be here until the 31st of August, but then I wanted to come home early, and I could come home on the 10th when the guys leave. But seriously, there is only two people that I would come home for. I want to know if things are going to be like they were before, or like they were back in June. I just want to know what to expect and whether or not it's worth going home for, because I am having a pretty good time here, and I know that I can most likely have more fun here than back home, the only reason I would go home is if I could fix things that got fucked up. If there is no use and it's going to be like we don't know each other anymore.

         Well I just got off the phone with Felicia, she had a shitty day yesterday as well, as it turns out, she and Anthony broke up, because he's "afraid of commiment" which is stupid... I think that it's only because he doesn't get any action with Felicia and their relationship is totally emotional. My last relationship was totally physically, and has nothing to do with commitment or emotions, (which became too clear to me as time went on) expessally when we just started fooling around after we stopped dating. Felicia and I both now what the other is feeling and what we are going through, we are going through pretty much the same thing. I wish that everything could be better, and that the guys saw everything from our point of veiw. I believe that me and Felicia being totally single is deffinetly for the best. There are some things that need to be done, and realized. We both need to figure eveything out on our own, with help from each other,&nbsp; and without guys. A relationship needs to be the same amount emotional, as physical. It seems people who are together for a really long time (in high school) haven't had sex, they do everything but. That is probably the way to go because (as I hear from two of my friends that dated and broke up) sex is the only thing that holds them together, and that it become to seem that it became expected, and boring. I think that sex would become really boring if you had it, over and over and over, and it would lose it's zeal... I think that to truely appreciate it you shouldn't have sex until you are married, then it would be something very special.     You should never regret anything that you ever do, you should learn from it, and move on and not make the same mistake twice. I know that I have been talking about *him* a lot lately, and it is partially because I still like him, and partially because I learned so much from him. I know it didn't last long, and you all probably think that I'm obsessed, but I'm really not, I'm just not ready to let it go. I'll be fine with time. "Time heals all wounds" is what they say.     But time doesn't heal all things. It's been 8 years since my grandfather died, and whenever I think about him I still cry. I was only 6 when he died, actually 5 almost 6. Too much has hit me at once. I decided to think about my guy problems because it takes my mind off of the fact that my family is all dying around me... My other grandmother isn't doing that well right now either. In and out of the hospital, can't go anywhere without oxygen... yeah. I have yet to see a silver linning on any cloud. I think that it's more like, there's a cloud on every silver linning. Why can't one GOOD thing happen to me?? Just absolutely good, nothing bad attached to it, just good. Why can't I be happy with myself? Why do I always have to see the bad in things instead of the good? I truely wish that I could just be entirely happy, forget about everything bad, just for a day. I wish that I could just stop crying! I managed to not cry the whole time I was on the phone with Felicia, which was around two hours. Other than that, I've cried through the night, and through the day. I'll stop crying a while and then I'll think of anything, and there I go again crying for the next two hours... I'm crying right now. I'm just grieving my mother tells me, my dad says that I walked into the middle of something terrible, which I did... Why did I have to come here. I don't want to have to deal with family, I wish I could just go mourn in private, I know that I should be happy that my family is here, and that I can be with them, but I'm not. My grandfather tells me that Grammie wouldn't want for me to be crying. I know that she wouldn't want me to be crying. I know she's up there watching down on me, on us. They all are, Grammie, Grandpa, and Grammie Abby. My poor little cousins, Ross is 10 and Nicole is 7. I don't remember Grandpa much, and I just don't want them to forget Grammie... she meant so much to me. I wish I could have been there for her, with her. I can't believe this is actually happening. I was looking through one of the piles of random things, and I saw a paper, and on one side my grandmother had written a poem, and on the other side it said 1993 in the corner, and in the middle it said "We love you, Joanne,&nbsp; Samantha, and Joelle." Sam and I actually signed it, my name was spelt, Jolle (with the J backwards) and Sam's name was slanted. The poem that was on the other side, was one that none of us had heard before, and that none of us knew why she had written it, but it said...  "The way I walk   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see my mother walking   My feet secure   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and firm upon the ground.   The way I talk   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear my daughter talking.   And hear my mother's echo   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sound.   The way she thought   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find myself now thinking.   The generations linking   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a firm continuum of mind.   The bridge of immortality   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm walking~   The voice before me echoing behind."&nbsp;    &nbsp;  *Analizing the poem*It's saying that as a family we all hold a piece of each other in us. "The bridge of immortality... I'm walking." I think that means that I am part of the immortality of my family.. I am carrying on our traditions, and our lives. I have a piece of each of them in me, and they have a piece of me in them. "The voice before me echoing behind." I would like to think of that as it would fit my life right now. My grandmothers' voices are infront of me, I will be with them soon, [in 70 years... give or take] and they are echoing behind, because now they are just memories from my past.     I really have to thank my father. He told&nbsp;me the day before I left for Maine, to call my Grandmother because if I don't I may regret it. So I called her later that day, while in 7-11 with Suzy and Felicia. I figured that I would talk to her the next day, I had no idea that that would be the last time I would ever talk to her. She told me about her surgery, and how there was a 80% chance that she would be fine, and the surgery would go without a hitch. Well it looks like she's in that 20%... She told me how much she loved me, and I did the same. She started crying in the middle of the conversation, which made me cry, and I got off the phone shortly after. She gave me the impression that she was ready to die, and absolutely okay with whatever was to happen. "I want the surgery so I can get better, and if it goes well, then great, but if I die then it's god's will and it's what he had planned for me." I learned that I was the only one she talked to about the surgery and about dying until after the surgery... That really touched me, in a way that I can't explain, like she trusted me with something that she hadn't told anyone else, and hadn't wanted to talk about with anyone, but she decided to share it with me.     I trust god completely, my Grandmother was a completely devoted Catholic, she introduced God to me, and took me to church every Sunday until 4th grade. I decided that I didn't want to go to Church anymore, and that I still believed in God, but I didn't need to go to Church to be an active Catholic, well the years went by. I went to a couple different Church's along the way, I went to FCC for a while. Then I wasn't really into it. Then in 8th grade, my friendship with Tori became very strong, and she convinced me to go to her Church, the Nazarene Church. I went on and off my 8th grade year, then towards the end of it I became a very active Christian I wouldn't miss church. I would be there every Sunday, and go to youth group, and bible study during lunch at school. Then I went away during the summer, and returned to being a very Christian girl. I wouldn't date a guy that wasn't Christian, and I wouldn't curse, and I wouldn't do anything rebelious in any way. Well in the middle of my Freshman year, Tori switched Church's, and slowly I faded away from the Church. Felicia and I would have long conversations about religions. Between Daril and Felicia, they brought me to opinion that Church was just a hox, (Mainly Daril... actually all Daril) and that there was no way that there could be a God. I stopped going to Church completely. Drifted away from religion, and convinced myself that I was an Atheist... "A recovering Christian" as Daril put it. But the truth is, I was absolutely happy as a Christian. Things seemed to be better for me, after I stopped going to Church I started hanging out with people who weren't the best for me. I did things that I shouldn't have I. I got into some bad things, started having bad habbits again. Cursing, and doing things that I knew I shouldn't have done. Being with the wrong kind of guys, hanging out with the wrong kind of girls.&nbsp; [No offence to anyone... I don't mean to offend anyone... so please don't be mad at me for this]  I believe that every experience plays a part in me being who I am. Those that hurt me make me stronger, those that weren't that smart, make me wiser, those that are not well thought out, make me think about things more carefully. I wouldn't change anything that I did, I will think about things in the future, and hopefully things are clearer to me, but I know that everything happens for a reason, and that everything that is happening, is happening for a reason, and who am I to mess with that or regret it?     I have came around to realizing some things lately. I've grown up a lot this summer, a lot has happened this last two months. Since the begining of May, I have realized who my true friends are, and how the wrong friends can really mess me up. There are many paths that lead to the same destination, there is an easy one and a hard one, one that will end quicker than the other one. Choose your path wisely, remember there is no turning around. There are forks in the roads that will either help you get on the right path, or deter you from it greatly.

       My grandmother died last night... she died three hours before I got to Bangor... I was on the phone with Felicia when it happened... I didn't know until I got back. To make matters worse my Great-Grandmother (my grandfathers mother) died with in the same 24 hours... I feel soo bad for my grandfather. I haven't stopped crying since I got here. This summer sucks so much. Why is it going so horrible. Everything is going wrong... my brother-in-law, my parents, my family dying... my sister did get married which was awesome, but I came back to some... unwelcome news, and more pain and misery. I hate my life. Nothing ever goes right, when things seem to be looking up something terrible has to happen... my sister gets married.. AWESOME, her husband breaks his back on their honeymoon, the day I find out, I find other things out as well. Then I get to go to Maine to see my family and get away from Florence, the day I get there my grandmother dies three hours before I arrive, and I also find out that my Grammie Abby dies as well. WHY?!?! That's all I want to know WHY? You know what FUCK THIS... FUCK EVERYTHING! I called my grandmother half an hour before she died, and they wouldn't let me talk to her, they told me she was doing fine, and everything went well. Why does everybody lie to me? Everyone that I trust lets me down, I'm just done trusting people. The people I hold closest to me are the ones who hurt me the most.

         Don't sweat the small stuff... and it's all small stuff      Well I'm sitting in the airport terminal listening to no-fx and watching the people. There is a blind man who is eating Burger King, which against my will, I had to eat for breakfast as well, only because of lack of choices. I'm in Seattle I have another two hours until my next flight. Last flight I slept the whole way, I only wanted two things, not to sit by little kids or someone fat... I ended up sitting next to this guy who was rather large... took up all of his space and most of mine, but he was a sweetheart.   On the way into the airport in Eugene I went through security and it kept beeping, so the first time I took off a huge metal braclet, the second time I took out my cell phone, and then they pulled me over to the side and I had to take off my belt, and it turned out it was beeping because I had condoms in my pocket, they made me take them out of my pocket (I totally forgot that they were in there) and my father was standing behind me. I was soo embarrassed, he didn't see them though. HOT ROD, and TROJAN haha. It's all Felicia's fault. I swear! Ashlyn and I bought them as a joke, and I decided that I shouldn't leave them in my room for my dad to find them, so I was going to give them to Felicia because she's never had one before, let alone, touched one, and I thought it was funny so I was going to give it to her :P She decided that her parents would most likely find it and she would get in trouble though.   We stayed up all night last night, and Felicia and Suzy brought me to the airport to see me off. It was a lot of fun. I've had so much on my mind lately, well mainly about one person. I don't know what I can do about it. Nothing I suppose, he doesn't want to talk to me in person, because he is seeing someone else, and he "doesn't want to risk it" and they are "trying to see if they are meant to be." Which personally, I think that's bullshit, why the hell would you be together only to find out if it's meant to be. "She's a complex girl" he tells me, I suppose I can't complain because at least he's talking to me about her, well at least he's talking to me at all. Although I think HE should be thankful that I'm willing to talk to him, after everything that has happened. But if he thinks that they are meant to be, then he shouldn't be tempted to cheat on her, expessally with a past fling, who happens to be 14, and that only lasted a month, give or take. I think that if he is tempted to cheat then obviously he's not that serious about her.   Why can't I get him out of me head?!?! He's done nothing but hurt me. I think that I need to meet a hot guy, and forget about Florence guys. They are stupid, not all of them, just a good majority of them.   Oh and Anthony, I'm sorry about my last blog entry, you just had me pissed off...&nbsp; When I get back it will be september... that means school starts soon. I don't want to go back! Actually, I'm pretty excited to go back, I'll have my permit, and then after that I get my license, then I am free, and I can do whatever I want to do.   I have a goal! My goal for the rest of the summer is to forget about certain people. They aren't worth it. I want to have as much fun as I can in Maine, that's my purpose in life right now. To be a kid for as long as I can, have as much fun as I can and being able to NOT GIVE A SHIT about ANYTHING.   This quote, was someone's msn name, I don't remember who, but the quote really stuck with me. "Live life the way you want to be remembered." :) It's just really sat with me well... My grandmother had heart surgery this morning, she's in Bangor, that's where I will be flying into. I really hope she's doing alright. It was an 80% chance that everything is going to go fine, and that she will be fine. She's been through so much this last year or two. I truely hope everything turns out alright.   Did I meantion that I'm going to be an Aunt?!?! I am so excited!! Possibly to twins! It's so happy! I love it so much. I love babies... when I can leave them at night. My sister is going to spoil that baby rotten, she spoils her sisters alot. I am so excited for her.   I talked to Felicia today, that was fun I woke her up, but she got a kick out of me having to be searched because I had condoms in my pocket *blushes* Not like I was planning on using them or anything, it's just that... what was I supposed to do? Leave them at home for my dad to find? I don't think so! That would be worse, well at least I'm protected ;) And that I haven't used them. Virginity wut? haha   This post will be long, if I decided to publish it... it might be kind of annoying, but what do I care, I won't be able to post very often, every once in a while, I'll get online. This is friggen long... yeah anyways... take care and don't worry about the small stuff...

         Men are stupid, throw rocks at them all!   I DON'T LIKE HIM YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER!   Who the hell would say to their g/f  FUCK YOU . I'm sorry that you lost all respect for me, but as soon as you said that I didn't care if you had any respect for me. You get mad over the stupidest things, she wanted two of his songs, big deal. Not something to get pissy over. You're just jealous of anything that Felicia is interested in. AND PLEASE STOP ACTING LIKE YOU'RE BLACK... YOU'RE NOT! Believe it or not you look SOO STUPID. BTW When you talk to Felicia and every other word is "Fuck" you sound really stupid, and come off as really immature. You act like a horrible boyfriend so shape up. Don't take offense to any of this, just change.

        This is the LAST time that anybody who comes over to spend the night is going to leave in the middle of the night, whether it's for their boyfriend or for coconut cream pie. I think it's amazingly stupid and I am fucking sick of it! I really like it when you don't even invite me. (Not when it's just them and their bf's but other things) "I haven't seen her in four days though" umm yeah live with it fucker. I hate this shit. I hope she doesn't expect to come back. I'm going to lock the door, and leave a note for her to stay at Ashlyn's. That is fucking shit. Well I'm going to bed soon.  Tomorrow is my last day here for the rest of the summer until September. I can't wait to leave. I'm tired of this fucking shit. People in Florence are stupid, that includes my friends *except Felicia* Earlier Suzy and I were talking about how you have to look at the positive things in every relationship, I've learned a lot of things in my last couple of relationships, I learned some good things and some bad things. I learned that it's okay to take risks, and also that you can't put all of your trust in anyone. I won't do that again and I'm not about to forgive and forget. Daril said something amazinly brilliant the other day, I'm not sure if I already talked about this in my blog or not earlier. A dating relationship can only go as far after the relationship as before it. If you are great friends before than you can be jgreat friends afterwards, if you aren't friends and you meet and start fooling around then afterwards you probably won't be very good friends and end up just fooling around some more afterwards. Okay friends will be okay friends, and what not.   Well that's all for me for now! Ciao until later. I probably won't be posting regularly for the next month or so, I will whenever I can get to a computer.

        I love how guys think that they can do everything in the world wrong, but as soon as they appologies it's all better. I don't know whether or not I should forgive him. I really want to, but I'm not sure if I can. He hurt me so badly. It wouldn't have been bad if he let it be, but he came back and started something again, and once again hurt me. I just wish it was over, I wish that I didn't have to deal with it. "You look so hurt every time you see me, it tears me up." That's bullshit. He doesn't care. I just wish that I could know what to expect, either hate me or like me. Don't go from liking me to hating me, to liking me, to hating me. Just make up your mind. Tell me what you want from me, and I'll tell you what I want. It's quite very simple, I just want everything to be figured out, and I want to know what you want with me. I don't care just let this be over with!

        Today was so much fun! It was great :D Yesterday was a lot of fun too! Suzy came over to my dads house around 1:30 or so, and we went to the Sandpark and Lon showed us all the pictures of us from the last afterhours (cute) and then the movie of us all sandboarding (again cute) and then we called Jordan and he came out and hung out with us and we headed out to the dunes and we did a couple runs and then we all crashed in the sand and sunbathed and kept warm and we layed there for around an hour and a half or two hours, then we went back to the Sandpark building and hung out there for a while, (someone was ACTUALLY talking to me who usually doesn't, it was nice) and then Suzy and I headed off to my moms house, and then put on our wetsuits (well not ours but yeah) and went swimming in the lake, it was great we couldn't go far under the water and we came up with fun water games :)  Then Jordan came over and we were all pretty tired so we went down to the lake house and crashed for a bit, (after swimming some more) and he left around midnight and Suze and I went to bed around 12:30. We got woken up by a bunch of people calling at 8-10 about some wood, and finally it got to the point where we couldn't go back to sleep. So we watched Life or Something Like It. Then cleaned the lake house. Then Tori called me and asked if I wanted to go to Yahats with her, (she is the only high schooler I am allowed to ride with) and we went and bought a cute black and white hat, and then we bought a lunch and had a picnic on the beach, and got some ice cream and talked about how stupid guys can be, and how I want to have a summer fling in Maine, and her in Georgia. Should be amazing fun.  Then I came home and helped my mom pack for Maine. Well I g2g ciao

        I thought we had a connection, I thought that it was communication, that is extended beyond your erection but action was your motivation, "I feel myself being swept away by you" you filled my heart with lies, only until you met someone new, You're just a jackass in disguise  How could I have thought,  That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  You were always so nice, How could I have know? I should have thought twice,  but my infactuation was full-blown, You flirted with someone else, Maybe you thought I wouldn't mind, You still kept taking off your belts, but I'm not quite that blind.  How could I have thought,   That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  We broke up after not too long, It was so hard to forget everything, I keep hearing all of your songs, Then my phone started to ring, You said how you missed me, kissing wouldn't satisfy you, It's other things that you wanted from me, so I tried some things that were new.  How could I have thought,  That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too ? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? you didn't really care about me  I gave in to things I didn't want to do, I wouldn't have minded to be friends, Then you told me we were through, you brought it all to an end, acquaintences is what you wanted to be, So tell me, what are we left with? At last you can be free, So now I'm just a memory.  How could I have thought, That this was all true? How could I have known, You didn't love me too? You held the key, the key to my emotions, Why didn't I see? You didn't really care about me

        Here is a kickass poem that I wrote, (with a little help from Suze) ;)   I thought we had a connection,  Extending beyond your erection  I thought it was communication,  But action was your motivation,  "I feel myself being swept away by you"  But only until you met someone new,  You filled my heart with lies,  You're just a jackass in disguise.   You were always too nice,  I should have thought twice,  How could I have known,  My infatuation was full-blown,  You flirted with someone else,  Yet you kept taking off your belts,  Maybe you thought I wouldn't mind,  But obviously I'm not that blind.   We broke up after not too long,  but I kept hearing all your songs,  It was so hard to forget everything,  then my phone started to ring,  You said how you missed me,  but you only wanted to kiss me,  Soon kissing didn't satisfy you,  I tried some things that were new   I gave in and did things I didn't want to,  Then you told me we were through,  I wouldn't have minded to be friends,  but you brought it all to an end,  Acquaintences is what you wanted to be,  I guess maybe now you can be free,  So tell me, what are we left with now?  This is my last goodbye,  --Ciao

        Daril told me to write a poem, but I didn't have time, and I found this poem that I wrote two months ago or so, I like it haha!  But that was long ago  Girls didn't care about boys, and boys didn't care about girls,  but that was long ago,  Parents were easier on us, Punishments weren't as severe,  but that was long ago,  We didn't have to worry about scholorships or colleges,  but that was long ago,  Sports weren't as competetive, Coaches weren't as serious,  but that was long ago  As we get older things get harder, we can always look back on the times when things were easy,  but that was long ago.
