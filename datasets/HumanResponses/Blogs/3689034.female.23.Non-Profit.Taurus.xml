      Here are some pretty incriminating pictures of our company carwash to benefit the American Heart Association from last weekend. I think we made around $600.00 for the association. Lots of people showed up to help. My friend Mindy is seen here wearing shorts, as am I. Though I would ordinarily be happier to publicly bear my bum than my legs (I feel it an enormous disservice to the general public), the carwash needed me. My legs also needed some faint suggestion of pigment, so I tried to bake the pastiness out of them in the late June sunshine.   That reminds me...I really need to wash my car, both inside and out. I never got around to getting the "detailing" done on my car after the great flood of '04, which left its moldy perfume lingering in my interior. Yes, I got stuck in the one flash-flood that we had all year. It wouldn't have been so bad if my boss hadn't specifically told me not to go out for lunch because it looked like heavy rain. Roughly 12 minutes after poo-pooing her warning, I was stranded in the middle of a small road that had flooded so thoroughly I couldn't drive through a puddle. The water flooded my engine and my car died right there. I almost died myself, as my car began slowly filling with water. I felt like I was aboard the Titanic, and after about 10 minutes of watching in disbelief as my belongings floated by me inside of my Ford Focus, I waded out to "shore." Anyway, I really need to get the smell out, especially now that its been compounded by the two mugs of coffee I've spilled on the rug and left since last weekend. Does anyone know of a place nearby that does satisfactory detailing for less than $50?

      You should really check out Melissa Ferrick.  Don't just buy a CD, or download her stuff off the internet. See her live. It's the only way to experience the raw, metallic, singing of her guitar and the soul-bearing, heart-wrenching, uplifting poetry of her songs. I've seen her three times, and her performance has blown me away every time. She's a spitfire for sure...known to shout explitives to an obnoxious or rudely inattentive audience, but she always puts on a great show. She may be unpredictable at times, but she is--in her own words--a "f*$#!ing professional."  Melissa plays a lot of smaller venues, folk, pride, and womyn's music festivals, and you can always find her performance dates at www.melissaferrick.com.

      Guess who caught the bouquet at Meghan's wedding?  If you said me, you're right. I'm not sure what this even means, but I didn't just casually pluck that delicate bundle of cala lilies out of the air. I DOVE for it. I boxed out like a Pistons defense player, brutally stampeding the hopeful young bridesmaids for a taste of floral victory. I never thought my competitive nature would manifest itself in a bouquet toss at a friend's wedding.   We had a fun night at Meg and Chris' wedding. It was a small group (about 125 people), and very intimate. I guess I'm comparing this to the Indian weddings I've been to, where there are at the very least 350. Anyway, It was a moving ceremony, and a light-hearted fun reception. My dear friend and bridesmaid Christie looked gorgeous (who said redheads can't wear red?), as did the bride. Dinner at Sanchez before the late wedding. Drinks at the reception. Denny's afterward. It was great. Now the happy couple are waking at the Amway Grand, having their first breakfast-in-bed as a married couple. I wonder which of my friends is next?   I have a short week coming up this week. We get Friday and Monday officially off for the 4th of July weekend, then its a week of vacation for me. I'll be heading to D.C. for four days for my Fulbright Orientation. I'm excited to see my friends Jillian and Austin. Par-tay. I'll keep you posted.

      My friends Meghan and Chris are tying the knot this weekend after what seems like an eternity. They've been together since junior year in high school. I remember they started flirting during the after school musical practices of "Brigadoon." I was one of the rolling hills of Scotland in that show. Anyway, Meg is the first of my close friends to officially get hitched, and we are all excited about the wedding (and breakin' it down at the reception). I'm even buying a new, extraordinarily girly outfit for the occasion.   Hopefully, this weekend will be another fun-filled one. In the pipeline: catch a showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 Friday, Fundraising car wash for the American Heart Association Saturday afternoon (where did I put my bikini?) Dinner con amigos Saturday (cookout at my parents?), and then the wedding. Two words: open bar.  This week has gone by quickly, but been rather rough. I had an interesting experience at work this week, involving an expensive pen, a naive email, and the Israeli Parliament. It's too hard to try to explain via blog. The whole fiasco reinforced my sneaking suspicion that a highly trained monkey could perform my job duties more efficiently than me.

      Here are some pictures from last weekend. John's going away gathering at the Heidelberg was fun, but wistful. The whole Susie/Kido crew showed up toward the end. There were U of M grad students, Cavnar family members, John's bar-buddies, old school MSU frisbee friends, and many more.

      OK, I've learned how to post pictures from my digital camera to this website. This is amazing. I never thought I would be able to "break on through," so to speak, in terms of using technology in my favor. I have more pictures to come. For now, enjoy the gallery o' John.  In non-weblog news, today was an interesting day. Still distraught after having lost my favorite jacket Saturday night--and by "lost" I mean "accidentally shut in my car door and dragged 3-4 miles behind me driving down the road until someone noticed one of the arms wedged in the back tire and flagged me down"--my plight was compounded when I noticed a flat tire on the way home from work. Again, it was a fellow motorist who noticed first (that's twice in three days), honking and urging me to roll my window down. Ooohhhh, so THAT would explain the grinding sound and the feeling of driving across a monster truck course. I thought it was just the rain. I'm not being sarcastic.   Flat tire. Dragged jacket. Coincidence? I think not. Just don't tell my Dad. He'll be furious if he finds out it wasn't "just a nail".

      It has finally hit me.  John is gone to China, and he ain't coming back. Actually he will be coming back...in two months, but then he's off again after three weeks. I dropped John--my beloved partner in crime--off at the airport yesterday EARLY in the morning. I was sad to see him go, but all I could think about as I stumbled, half awake, out of the DTW airport was going back to bed. Then, as I was listening to a piece on weekend morning edition about bear bile farming in China, it hit me. John wouldn't be back anytime soon. I felt the way Sam must have felt when Frodo boarded that fancy Elf boat and sailed off into the sunset of immortality. It made me really sad. Hanging out in Ann Arbor just isn't the same without Johnny G.  We had a going away get together for John on Friday, and the strange potpourri of people that know and love him were there. The night ended (of course) at the Heidelberg's Ratskeller. I sucessfully avoided getting too loaded, which means I had roughly 1.5 beers. Last night was a casual evening at the Aut Bar with Peggy, Blair, Kim, Kasey, and crew. It was fun to catch up, and I got to meet Kasey's girlfriend Kate, who is a former debater-turned-stand-up-comic. Will Repko?  I spoke with John briefly. I called him in San Fransisco, but he seemed to be partying pretty hard with Evan and Bob Tiews. With those two, I can only imagine the trouble they got into. I wonder if he even made his flight to Beijing this morning? I haven't heard from him yet, come to think about it...   Well, I'll try to load up some pictures from this weekend. Hope you have a good week.

      Hello? Is this thing on? H-Hello?  Yes, scoff all you want. I am starting a weblog. I'm pretty technologically inept, so please bear with me as I learn my way around cyber-communication. I have officially announced to the world (read: my supervisors at work) that I am departing for Bangladesh in the fall. I'm starting this weblog to document my travels over the next academic year, as I pursue research in the field of gender and development in Bangladesh with my Fulbright grant.   In the meantime, I'll try to post pictures and commentary now and then. I finally learned how to actually upload pictures from my digital camera to my computer. I have some pretty interesting pictures from New York, D.C., and weekend shenanigans with my friends.   I hope that you enjoy my weblog, and that I can keep up with daily (or at least weekly) posts. My previous attempts at keeping any form of journal have gone the way of the Dodo...  Adios,  Tanya

      It's Saturday, the third day of my extended vacation, and I'm thinking about a number of things. Primarily surrounding my impending trip (the tasks for which I have to complete in the next 4 weeks are driving me steadily insane).  1. Between now and February 2005, I will probably see John for a grand total of three days. I was trying to swing a "quick" stopover to Beijing en route to Dhaka, but the airline prices are astronomical. Admittedly, I'm not the one paying for it, but I do have a limited budget. I'd rather blow the cash on a vacation to Cambodia or something later.  2. My love of the Lord of the Rings has reached embarrassingly obsessive proportions. I own each DVD of the trilogy now, and sit for hours drooling over the extras late into the night. I'm also reading the book. I think genius of J.R.R. Tolkein is up there with some of the greatest minds of our time, surpassing even the brilliance of Pauly Shore.  3. My sister is the greatest. I've been having such a great time with her this weekend doing absolutely nothing. We went shopping (one of my least favorite activities in the world), watched some TV, and practiced the German liederhosen dance from Steven Colbert's routine on the "Strangers with Candy" DVD. Our parents looked at us (quite rightly) like we were insane. I love having a best friend for a sister.  4. Everyone's getting married except me. This Saturday my sister went to a second of her high school friends' weddings this summer. These women have to be 21 or 22. I'm 23, so by West Michigan standards, I'm quickly approaching Old Maidom. It's all right with me, mama.  5. Recent movies: Monsieur Ibrahim, The Fog of War, The Triplets of Belleville. All excellent. On my cinema horizon: Napoleon Dynamite, Goodbye Lenin, The Lord of the Rings DVDs (again).  Well, I'm off to have dinner with the family and some of our closest friends. It's Bengali food night, so the whole house is perfumed with various fish odors. I'll be eating some "niramish" (vegetables).  Enjoy the rest of the weekend.  Tanya

      Ganges, MI: Did you even know there was a place with that name? If you don't know, that's also the name of the river in India considered to be the holiest and most (spiritually) cleansing. The river itself is chock full of industrial and other pollutants these days.  Appropriately named Ganges, Michigan is where we held a private prayer and offering service for my late grandmother today. My mother, father, sister, and uncle went to the Interfaith Ashram/Faith Center today and we did a puja ceremony, sang bhajans (devotional songs), and went to the shores of beautiful Lake Michigan to release flowers into the water in lieu of her ashes, which symbolizes a "freeing" of the spirit. It was really wonderful, and the place is so interesting. Though the staff are mainly American Hindu monks, it also serves as a learning center for all faiths (featuring weekly speakers and sessions from Islam to Native American spiritual traditions to Godess Worship). In addition, the center provides a refuge service for survivors of domestic violence. The Swami today actually asked me to come back and speak some time about Islam in Bangladesh. I was very touched...and then I wondered if there was a karaoke machine somewhere in the back, you know, just in case.  Because I wasn't raised in a rigorous religious tradition, its rare when we do something outwardly spiritual like this. I was very moved by the whole thing, and it has reawakened in me&nbsp;an interest in faith and religion that I have tucked away for a long time. It's strange that on the same day that I had a reconnection with my own faith, we had door-to-door Evangelists visit our home for the first time I can remember in 15 years. I looked out the window and could tell right away from the short-sleeved collared shirts and modest ties that they were preaching the book of Mormon.&nbsp; I had an incredibly difficult time trying to politely move them on their way. In retrospect, I can't even remember what the hell I said. It was something brilliant like "Hi...er, that's nice...interfaith...yeah, like Jesus was totally great...Salt Lake City is cool...that's okay don't worry about it." My Dad asked why I didn't just tell them we were Hindus and not interested in having them come back to share the scriptures more thoroughly. Hmmm....for some reason, that thought never&nbsp;occurred to me.&nbsp; Maybe its because growing up in Grand Rapids in the religious minority puts one immediately on the defensive.  Well, that is all for now. Blogging is actually causing me eyestrain these days. Perhaps because I can't write succinctly and end up bloggin for paragraphs and paragraphs ad nauseum.&nbsp; Let me leave you with this one thought on "the soul" that our religious teacher from when I was a kid passed on to me:  "Beta (my child), just because a light bulb breaks, it does not mean that the electricity is gone. Such is the eternal soul."

      If you haven't seen the election parody cartoon on the web entitled "This Land," then you should be ashamed of yourself. You must checketh it out. Its incredibly witty, and a welcome relief from the venemous tit-for-tat political rhetoric of this election year. It pokes fun at both candidates. The site is  urlLink http://www.dissonant.org/~pjammer/movies/mirror.html .   It's been another quiet week at work, though there is a ton of work to do before I leave my job on August 27th. I'll be really sad to leave Cascade. It was such a great work experience, and I met some terrific people and trying challenges. It also made me come to the realization that I really like working, and if I could work for a few years before tackling graduate school, I'd be the better for it, especially if it were a job in my field. With my year of experience at Cascade, I've&nbsp;gotten&nbsp;valuable lessons&nbsp;in&nbsp;the business world, the non-profit world, administrative and project coordination, and general professionalism. Whoa, is this a blog or a resume? Sorry about that. But...in case you know of any international development organizations looking for a project coordinator, hook me up.  In other news, I talked to John in China late last night. He's sicker than a dog for the third or fourth time in a month. He said he was pretty miserable there, and I can sense his apprehension at spending an entire year inthe People's Republic. The poor kid. I hope that his experience in the more remote region of Harbin will be different than his hectic Beijing summer.  Tomorrow is the offering/funerary service for my grandmother in appropriately named Ganges, Michigan. I am hoping it will be a time for all of us to remember my grandparents, honor their legacy, and feel reassured that their spirits are in a higher place.  Well, that's today in a nutshell. Hey, look, today's in a nut shell! What kind of a...nut has a...shell like...okay I'm a dork.

      If having fun were a crime, I'd be a convicted felon, no chance at parole.  I've been having way too much fun recently. Last weekend saw coworker karaoke, some serious "breakin' it down" at the B.O.B., and a hibachi dinner with the family, complete with our own chef-come-performance artist "Bill." Bill kept squirting this bottle of prank mustard at my Mom. He got her to jump three times at the line of yarnish string that popped out the rather convincing bottle.   In other news, I miss John. It's officially been over a month, with one left to go. Yesterday was the first time I saw a picture of him in China. It was on a weblog that belonged to a friend of his. John's friend said he was "a good conversationlist" and "ultra polite." That's my boy!&nbsp;In the picture, John&nbsp;was beaming and holding up some chopsticks in a Korean restaurant in Beijing. It made me miss him even more.   I'm spending this week getting some stuff done for my trip. I STILL haven't received my official grant agreement OR my reimbursement check from the orientation from the Fulbright people. I'm starting to get really annoyed with this fiscal bureacracy crap.  Must run. Hilary on TV (Clinton, not Duff).  &nbsp;

      Tori, sweet Tori. I'm listening to her first album right now.  It's noon and I've taken a half day from work to go get some vaccinations at the MSU travel clinic. It was a really nice trip up to East Lansing. The weather was perfect--by Tanya standards-- this morning.&nbsp; A bit brisk and chilly, but very sunny. It was like a nice fall day, but in July. After my pretty badly bungled appointment (I can't even talk about it...I'll fly into a Hulk-like rage) I sat at the Bruegger's Cafe, the first place I ever made a pass at John, and had a rosemary olive oil bagel with sundried tomato paste and hummus with&nbsp;a medium coffee. It was like college all over again, except this time, I was in my square work clothes instead of my&nbsp;old college uniform of &nbsp;"jeans- and-band-t-shirt." Sigh. It was a very nostalgic moment, seeing all of the beatiful old buildings, gorgeous landscaping, and the hippies playin' hackey sack outside the drug store.&nbsp; Memories.  Last night I had a great time at BW3&nbsp; with my Cascade Engineering comrades. We were there for a goodbye party for another coworker who is leaving the company. It was quite a large group, and we drank, danced, and were generally merry. Did I mention that there was karaoke? My "getting to bed early" plan was thus doomed. All I have to say is "just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there..."&nbsp;  I'm looking forward to a nice weekend with my family and some old school friends. My sister is coming home for the first time in months after she takes the DAT Saturday. Wish her luck ( urlLink spalit@umich.edu )! My good buddy Rick (aka "The Rza") is rollin' into Van Rapids for a wedding and we are hanging out tonight, I think. Weekends: chocolate chip cookies have met their match.&nbsp; I love you weekends!  Well I'm off to work. Interviewing someone for my position today. Perhaps it will be a trained monkey, in which case I'm 100% certain he or she&nbsp;will be able to outperform me in my administrative duties, seeing as how I am a complete Bozo. Hmm...maybe the candidate's name will be Bozo, you never know. Maybe Mittens, or Shamu. Wait, that's a whale.   Ok, must run.

      I would just like to note that&nbsp;"State Side, with Charity Nebbe" has been pulled from Michigan Radio's daily line up. We are now only being made to endure the show's bland subject matter&nbsp; and unimaginitive interviews once a week on Fridays. My dear&nbsp;friends Christie and public radio host Todd Mundt pointed this out to me only a few days after my ranting blog on the subject. A coincidence, or democracy in action?   You decide.   Join me next time, as I explore the question&nbsp;&nbsp;"how fast IS a sneeze?" We'll talk to one expert at Central Michigan University who has devoted his career to mapping the speed of "achoo," next time...on State Side. Gazoontite!

      Indeed, my dear strands of tuberculin protein, I have&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;under my skin...the skin of my right forearm, to be exact. &nbsp;Today I&nbsp;underwent a "skin test" for Tuberculosis, just&nbsp;a small installment of the solid week of health tests and vaccinations that I must endure this Monday through Friday.&nbsp; The IIE people require 30+ tests for one to get "medical clearance" for overseas travel. I doubt that the Bangladeshi&nbsp; "Health Ministry" &nbsp;really cares...I mean, their office probably comprises a nutritionist,&nbsp; a card table, and a couple of &nbsp;goats. &nbsp; Today was horrific. I called the doctors office in a nervous panic 3 hours before the test asking what they were going to do to me, if it hurt, if I was going to get woozy,&nbsp;etc. The nurse just seemed confused at my alarm, and she had clearly had enough when I asked if "skin test" was the same as "skin graft." I've &nbsp;heard those were painful. The words "skin test" kept buzzing through my brain all morning, as I imagined a giant peeling knife swooping down from the sky, shaving off sizable portions of my hide like a helpless carrot or defenseless potato.&nbsp; It turned out that they just make a quick prick and there was a bump the size of a small mosquito bite on my arm. She said they would check for swelling in 48 hours. That was it. As I walked out of the office, I kept casting suspicious side-long glances at each nurse and closet door, half expecting the&nbsp;sinister jumbo-knife to creep up from behind me. &nbsp; Yesterday were the blood and urine tests. Just thinking about blood tests makes me weak in the knees.&nbsp; And peeing in a cup? Oh, the humanity! The lab techs got a kick out of me. I winced in pain as they swished rubbing alcohol on my arm. I really think they tied that heroine addict tube thing uneccessarily tight.&nbsp; I almost passed out twice, and I STILL cannot make a fist today.&nbsp; For the rest of the week, I have vaccinations to look forward to0--Friday morning, no less. I hope its not with the same&nbsp;harsh nurse I had last time. She said I was "being a baby" during the tetanus shots (hey...they were deep tissue!).&nbsp;  &nbsp; At least I can be thank ful that I never decided to pursue my interests in biology. Even though it is the study of life and its components, I don't think I would have made it out alive. Bleh.

      Sadly, I learned late last night that my paternal grandmother had passed away in India. She was 87 years old.  &nbsp;  All of we grandchildren call her "Ogo," a pet name that our Dadu (grandfather) gave her. A "domestic engineer" all her life, Ogo bore and raised five children and stood proudly by my grandfather's side as he traveled the world lecturing and researching at universities world-wide, from Stanford to the University of Ghana in West Africa. She was a strong woman who ran an efficient household, even until the last years of her life.&nbsp;Our family legend even involves&nbsp;Ogo's&nbsp;run-in with a cobra that had somehow gotten inside our house in Calcutta. That cobra is now sitting on a window sill&nbsp;coiled in a glass jar, preserved in a chemical cocktail that my&nbsp;Dadu &nbsp;dreamed up. I've seen it, and photographed it.  &nbsp;  Ogo was strong, but gentle. She sacrificed, yet she had conviction. She was kind to everyone she met, and she seemed to love people of all cultures. Many a "bideshi" (foreigner) has been a guest in her home. When she reached her later years, Ogo began to develop a pigment disorder, and large portions of her body lost their color and became white. It gave her a somewhat "spotted" appearance,&nbsp;which I always found benign and endearing. Now that I think about it, I've never known a non-spotted Ogo...I guess it would seem strange to me to have a uni-color grandmother!  &nbsp;  I was fortunate enough to have seen my grandmother last year. I visited Calcutta several times between January and April of 2003. I was next door in Dhaka, Bangladesh doing an internship and crashed at Ogo's flat.&nbsp; I would tell her of my Bangladesh adventures, recount stories, sing songs, and do impersonations. She said I was "exactly like her Bobby" (my Dad).&nbsp;Below is a picture with Ogo, my two paternal&nbsp;aunts (her daughters), and myself. We were sitting in Ogo's bedroom in Calcutta. I feel&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;blessed to have had the fortune to be there. Before last year, I hadn't visited my family in India for TEN years...  &nbsp;  Both now passed on, My Ogo and Dadu leave behind a strong legacy--a legacy of selflessness, charity, and love. I hope that we as the new generation can carry on their legacy in our relationships with each other, in our professions, and in our lives.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      "Mom," I pleaded, "the phrase is dog-eat-dog world, not doggy dogg."  Mom, somewhat defeated, replied "well I don't know all these rappers Thania."  &nbsp; Speaking of dogs, isn't Raja (the family canine) the cutest? I'm sorry, I know you think your dog is cute, but you are wrong. Raja--which appropriately means "king" in Hindi--is pure royalty. He's a snuggly, 11-year old mix&nbsp;between&nbsp;a Bischond and a Yorkshire Terrier. He's non-shedding, laid back, and travel-sized for our convenience. What a mutt. Raja rocks. &nbsp; My mother absolutely adores him. Dad loves Raja, too, he just won't admit it. I see them doing their male bonding thing when no one's watching. It's a damn good thing, too. All the women in our house have cuddled that dog into submission. Now when he sees a human walking toward him, he usually turns over belly-up (assuming he's not already laying down), flops his paws over,&nbsp;and expects a good tummy rub. Excellent gaurd dog. &nbsp; He just had his 11th birthday yesterday. Mom almost made me order him a beef burrito from the Beltline Bar for his special birthday dinner. I don't know what we'll do when the little bugger's gone. He's a member of the family. He sleeps under the sheets, often with his wee head on the pillow. He gladly urinates on the &nbsp;southwest corner of my bed daily, and he eats chicken curry like its going out of style. In an uncharacteristically affectionate moment the other day, I gave my Mom a big hug, and she started patting my head saying "good boy, Raja, g-boy!" She didn't realize it until I pointed out that I was her human daughter, Tanya. &nbsp; Dogs: are they man's best friend, or is it just a big hoax coordinated by the leadership of some bizarro dog planet? If dogs could talk, might they really&nbsp;say "hey...you don't see us going around pickin' up THEIR poop."

      What's green and purple and destroying deciduous forests across Michigan? Well I'm glad you asked. The curious path of the Emerald Ash bore...next...on State Side.  I have never encountered a radio program more painful than Michigan Radio's "Stateside, with Charity Nebbe." Seriously, every time I hear the lame, bass-heavy, pseudo new-age theme music, my stomach turns and I promptly change the channel to Oldies 107.3. It even got to a point where I'd start planning my lunch breaks around NOT catching that show. What's the deal? Usually NPR has such high quality programming. Then they churn out this turd of a talk show and completely undermine public radio's credibility.   Perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit. I mean, no radio talk show with a Michigan theme can possibly be that interesting. You'd be hard pressed to find an audience who shows too much enthusiasm about Michigan's thriving cup-manufacturing industry, or the increase of pet-owners in the upper peninsula over the past decade. But Charity Nebbe, the host of the show, is criminally bad. She has a "smiley face" tone of voice that makes even the most grave subjects (racial segregation in Detroit Public Schools) sound like ingenuine small talk at a party (Oh, you're applying to law school? That's great! Oh, your public schools are dilapidated, underfunded, and unsafe? Excellent!!). She also CLEARLY reads from some cheesy script of questions. She never follows up, or catches interesting tangents.   When Terry Gross interviews people, you can almost visualize her leaning back in her chair, brows furrowed, touching her chin pensively as she listens. When Charity puts someone on the hot seat, she sounds as if she's about to lunge forward, grab the mic out of the interviewee's hand, and announce "HEY!! I GOT A RADIO SHOW!!!"  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. I mean, it's not an easy job, and it does bring unusual facts about Michigan to the listener's attention.  Nah.

      I've just returned from Washington D.C. after an invigorating week at the Fulbright Orientation for scholars traveling to North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It was truly awesome, and now I'm even more pumped for my trip to Bangladesh. I'll try not to yap about it too much, but a few thoughts on the program:  1. My "cohort" is truly fantastico (if I do say so myself--wink wink). Among the group there were Rhodes scholars, Harvard grads, activists, world-travelers, and generally bright people. The best part was that every single person in that room had serious leadership qualities. It wasn't a roomful of nerdy geniuses who were work-horses but socially inept. Everyone there was the kind of person that would come up to you, introduce themselves, shake your hand, and ask about you, and maybe even crack a few jokes in Arabic. I felt honored to be among them (though I'm still convinced that I may have been selected due to some administrative error during the application process or something).  2. The orientation really stressed cultural exchange and mutual understanding more than the research. One program officer said that it wasn't as important to "have perfect data" as it was to interact with people, volunteer, and generally be a personal diplomat. They explicitly told us that we were not to be mouthpieces for the U.S. government or its foreign policy (praise Allah), but rather human bridges between people here and people abroad. The most important part of our Fulbright experience, we were told, was when we returned home to educate Americans about other countries and cultures...especially crucial for the region of the world we're all going to. In the past, war has been the only way most Americans learn their world geography.  3. I met the two other students traveling to Bangladesh. Katie, who comes from a small town in Wisconsin and is married to a Bangladeshi man, is really cool. I got a chance to meet her Mom (hilarious) and sister as well. She has a really unique perspective on Bangladeshi culture through the eyes of an American Bangladeshi "bo"(wife). She also has some mad Bengali language skills. Keisuke, a Cornell grad from L.A., is a true-go getter, but he knows how to have a good time. It was totally his idea to take a picture with the three of us in front of the NPR building in Washington, spelling out the letters N-P-R with our arms. I have a feeling we're going to have a lot of fun traveling the world all together.  4. I got to spend some time with friends from the past as well. I met up with Austin and Jillian two nights in a row, and as a surprise bonus, got to meet up with Freddy Blavin as well. It was a treat. Fredo, as usual, tried to bite my "sausage fingers," as I simulated dunking him into a large tub of BBQ sauce (I always joked that he resembled a chicken McNugget in high school).   Saturday night I got to hang out with Beth and her buddies from High School. They are so funny that my sides hurt today from laughing all night. They remind me of Christie, Peggy, Meghan and myself (tear). I love having friend clicks, I ain't gonna lie.  That's enough for now. Don't worry...plenty of gushing about my fellow Fulbrighters to come. Tah-tah.

      Ah, the Fourth of July. A time for gathering, grilling, and Whitney Houston's version of the Star-Spangled Banner.  What? You  mean your family doesn't solemnly listen to the first track on Whitney's patriotic CD, then hold hands in a circle, sing "God Bless America," and make each person talk about what being an American means to them? Well I guess your family's just weird then.  I'm really not kidding about any of this. It's really touching and sweet, if only slightly humiliating. My parents are so proud to be in this country and to have raised their kids here, and they certainly enjoy spreading this joy, especially my Dad (even though I find it a bit ironic that he's been here since 1967 but never gotten around to applying for citizenship). We ended the evening with a resounding, out-of-tune version of the Indian National Anthem, Jonna Ghonna Monna. It was oddly reminiscent of Thanksgiving, where we have a similar ritual, during which my sister unfailingly chokes up when its her turn to talk about what she's thankful for. She usually gets as far as "I'm thankful for...for my family...sniffle..." She's adorable.   Afterwards, I headed out to Billy's for 80's night with my friend and former housemate Libby and crew (see picture above). It was fun. It was the first year I skipped fireworks for Duran, Duran.   This Fourth was also thought-provoking for me. My friend and supervisor at work is extremely socially-conscious, and very much an activist. She taught me about "Juneteenth," a celebration of African American freedom. In lieu of celebrating the traditional 4th-of-July festivities, she and her husband celebrate June 19th, the day of freedom from slavery for Black Americans in the south. It wasn't until well over 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Learning about that was a really enlightening experience. Few of us ever stop to think who's independence we're celebrating as the fireworks burst in the sky, and the French's mustard is piped over plump and sweaty hotdogs. Maybe next year I'll be celebrating on 6/19/05 instead...

      It's been a splendidly uneventful couple of days, and I'm really enjoying it. The most productive thing I've done is purchase a Lonely Planet guidebook for Southeast Asia (those Lonely Planet books are FANTASTIC). John and I are planning to make a whirlwind trip through the region this winter, as he has a break between semesters and I get time off from my research schedule for the holy festival of Eid. I'll be glad to get out of the country that week, as it is the annual mass cow slaughter in the middle of Dhaka city. I was in the country last year on Eid, and it was far from vegan-friendly. Anyway, this travel opportunity is like a dream come to for me, since John and I both have great appreciation for and fascination with Southeast Asian political, social, and cultural history. In fact, we first met in a Southeast Asian politics class in college (awwwww). I think we're planning on hitting up Thailand (hopefully we'll get out of the heavily-Western influenced city of Bangkok and out into the countryside), Cambodia to see the great temples of Angkor Wat, and hopefully some part of Indonesia...we'll have to decide which one of the country's 14,000 islands to check out. Here's a useful trivia fact by the way: Indonesia is the country with the largest Muslim population on earth. The second? You'll never guess. Hint: It's the home of the Taj Mahal.   Well enough IR 101 for now. Champagne wishes...

      I am entering ten uninterrupted days of vacational bliss...  Okay, so some of them are weekends and company holidays, and I'm not entirely convinced that "vacational" is even a real word, but I could not be more jazzed. I am going to sit around and do nothing. Actually, I hope to accomplish a lot in the next week, but I'll go at my own tortoise pace.   I have no fourth-of-July plans this year. Last year we went to Canada on the 4th long weekend. Something about that trip struck me as oddly unpatriotic. I felt like a draft-dodger or something.   I will be heading out to Washington D.C. next Wednesday for my Fulbright Orientation. I'm really excited to see Jill and Austy Frosty. I've really been looking forward to heading back to D.C. now that I know the place a little more, and I'm glad to be meeting my future B-desh colleauges face to face. This time I'll be sure to take pictures...unlike at Meghan's wedding...crap.

      Yet another lazy Sunday, and I'm still sitting around in my pajamas at noon. I just had a chunk of the giant Hershey's Symphony bar that's been laying on the countertop all weekend, tormenting me. I gave in to the choco-rapture, at long last. It's a bitter sweet Symphony, this life.  Last night my sister accompanied me to the MSU McNair/SROP Scholars Alumni Dinner in Lansing. We celebrated 15 years of McNair at MSU, and got to meet scholars who were in the program when it first began in 1988. I was a scholar in both 2001 and 2002. I saw a lot of old school people: Trinh, Carl, Soh, Tanya J., Erica, Terrence, Ernest T. Caldwell Jr., Charles Wells (HOT-Lanta!), and several others. It was wonderful to connect with these amazing people again and to hear where they are in their lives. And as always, it was great to see Tay. All of the alum got to get on the mic for fifteen seconds and talk about what they've done since leaving McNair. I used my air time to make a 15 second plug for Fulbright. I even brought promotional brochures with me. OK, I know I'm a nerd, but I really think Fulbright could use a more socioeconomically diverse applicant pool.  I also got a phone call from John today. He'll be home from China in seven days! It's frustrating that we can't spend very much time together in the U.S. before spending another 4-5 months apart. He's returning to the PRC Sept. 2nd. This is the lifestyle we've chosen though, and with both of us heading for internationally-oriented careers, we have to learn how to tough it out and spend time (as Richard Marx once said) "oceans apart."  Hope you have a great week.

         * feel free to comment on any of my posts, whether you are a Blogger user or not. I've changed my settings to allow all of my web-using friends to drop notes on my weblog! *   Though I still walk with a noticeable limp, things south of my knee are steadily improving. It looks worse than it is, with the purply-black bruises adorning the left side of my foot, but the physical therapy sessions that I started yesterday are sure to put me on the road to recovery. Even if the sessions are a bit strange.  The pleasant, young, blonde therapist who was working on me asked me what my "goals" of physiotherapy were. It was hard for me not to answer that question with the obvious "um...my goal is to not feel like crap", but I bit the bullet and replied with some cheesy, plastic response ("I want to learn how to improve my health overall and avoid future injury). After some strange tests and a somewhat uncomfortable "massage" of my plump ankle, she hooked me up--quite literally--to a machine that sent electrical shocks to my leg. It was a 1960's looking computer thing, rolled in on a cart, complete with the sticky pad and wires, hooked onto four carefully chosen spots on my foot and leg. I found myself feeling slightly panicked, as if my foot were about to undergo a lie detector test (had my foot been dishonest?). I imagined the machine asking my foot questions like "so Tanya wasn't actually  carrying  anything when she tripped over the curb?" or "has she sprained you before?" perhaps "have you been forced involuntarily into stilettos in the past month?" My foot would have to shamefully answer "yes" to all accounts. I think my feet STILL hurt from those notorious $70.00 strappies I wore to Meg's wedding.  Anyway, other than the podiatry lie-detector device, the rest of the appointment was fine. She gave me some exercises to do, including tracing the alphabet with my foot thrice a day. Hey, it's harder than it sounds. I keep forgetting "W." I sure hope everyone else dumps the "W" on November 2nd...  Well, tomorrow is the one-week anniversary of "the fall." I hope it'll get better soon so it can stop dominating all of my blog posts. For now, I just bask in the glow of the sympathetic looks and the I'll-get-that-for-yous. The Chairman/CEO/owner of our company (for whom I work) was so concerned that he left me a little note by my computer before he left for vacation. "Sorry to hear about your ankle! Here's to a speedy recovery!" He asks about it every time he calls into the office. It's very sweet.  Here's to a speedy recovery indeed.

      Even though its been a gorgeous weekend, I'm in a very cloudy mood. It's been miserable having to stay indoors and inactive all weekend. My foot and ankle are still swollen and painful, but I have to go back to work tomorrow. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with the work I have to do for my trip, especially with all the delays.  And on top of that, I am surfin' the crimson wave. I've cried at nearly every cotton commercial I've seen over the last 2 days. Wah. I know I'm being a baby, but I just want to take my ball and go home.  On the upside, I got to go to Yesterdog with Mom Saturday (on crutches) and visited the Fulton St. farmer's market briefly (also on crutches). It took nearly the rest of the day to recuperate, though, so I decided to take it easy for the rest of the weekend. Also, I felt very loved today since  four  of my awesome friends called either because they were thinking about me or to check in. It was a nice feeling. Oh yeah, and Mom made fresh peach cobbler with peaches she bought at the farmer's market...it was vegan, too (not that it matters much these days). Dad snuck me some Mrs. Field's cookies, too. Now I'm stuffed and ready to hit the hay early. The muscle relaxers just kicked in...woo...  Have a great week.

      My ankle is the size of an average citrus fruit.  I would say it's somewhere between a standard orange and a grapefruit. Yes, I somehow managed to attain a severe sprain to my left ankle, and on a Friday morning AT WORK. I am now on crutches, in a brace, iced, elevated, and  completely  incapacitated. It even hurts to nap.  I think the more serious injury that I sustained was the wicked blow to my ego. It happened all in one mortifying instant, when I was running back inside the unfamiliar building in which an offsite business meeting would occur that day. I tripped forward on curb, and all I remember is the thick and dewey morning grass rushing up to hit me in the face. I think I cowered on all fours for a minute before I realized that my ankle was swelling at the rate of a driver's side airbag. I pondered crying, then thought of how much my friend Mindy would rip on me (I had  just  been roasting her the night before about her run-in with the wall on Thursday--she actually knocked an award off the wall). I managed to hop on over to my Mom's SUV and grab my cell phone to make some really humiliating phone calls to my supervisor and mom.  I'm home right now, taking some meds and hobbling about like a true tripod. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to walk on it by Monday, but it looks for now like someone's going to be spending the weekend holed up in the computer room or laying in the couch watching movies. Oh wait...that's how I spend my weekends anyway. Maybe its not so bad afterall...

      Yes, that is a candid picture my mom and/or dad took of my unintentional nap on the deck yesterday after work. I went to go enjoy the non-airconditioned environment of our back deck just before my nightly date with Peter Jennings on ABC news, and before I knew it, I sat up dizzily, my contacts were dry and sticky, and my parents were snickering. I was really confused about why "Entertainment Tonight" was on during the news hour, then I realized that I had completely slept through it (sniffle--Peter--sniffle). My sister knows how I feel about sleeping outside. It gives me the heebie-jeebies. Just ask any of my friends I've ever gone "camping" with.  I'm not sure why I've been so wiped out. Perhaps its the extra load at work. I've been covering for the assistant to the President and CFO while she is out with pneumonia (yikes). Maybe its the new regiment of stomach medicine I am FINALLY taking, after years of John pleading with me. It could also be the lack of physical activity in my life right now. They say exercise give you more energy...I guess that only applies if you actually  use  the expensive gym membership you purchased. It could also be the late nights I've been pulling. I still find myself trying to deny my 8 to 5 lifestyle, and continue plodding along on college standard time (wake at 10:00, eat at 1:00, nap at 4:00, bed at 2:00am). I miss the good ole' days.  In any case, I'm sapped for energy this week. Maybe I just need another vacation?

      The floods in the capital city of Dhaka have slowed the pace of life in Bangladesh for many. These are rickshaws, a main means of transportation around Bangladesh.  urlLink

      As my departure date (which I still haven't been able to solidify because my Fulbright documents  still  haven't arrived) draws nearer, I am getting more and more anxious about my trip. I've been following the stories about the devastating floods in Bangladesh and East India over the past few weeks. True, Bangladesh is essentially a giant river delta and it floods every year as the Himalayan snows melt into the country's 1000 rivers, but this flooding is the worst in recent history. Thankfully the water is beginning to recede, so the millions of people marooned and left homeless can begin their long trek home--that is,  if there is any "home" to return to. The more impending fear now is of an epidemic of water-bourne illnesses, such as cholera and dysentery, not to mention the wave of malaria that is likely in the coming months. With uncontaminated food and water in short supply, you could imagine the humanitarian crisis that's on the horizon.  It's heart breaking because the people who suffer the most during these times are the poorest and most desparate. I remember driving through the countryside last year packed in a "minibus" and seeing half-sawed off canoes dotting barren jute fields every twenty yards or so. I wondered what they were for a while, and then it occurred to me that these were people's homes. It pained me to think that in a few months, those lands would be completely submerged by water, and the families of 5 or 10 or 15 would have nowhere to go.  I'm glad there are so many organizations doing relief work, including BRAC. I hope I can be a part of the effort while I'm there.
