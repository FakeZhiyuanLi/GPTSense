      Well here I am back from a six hour outing wif *ahem* somebody... I'll introduce this person the after i actually manage to load pics in...  Well... ANYWAYZ... I went out wif the person I mentioned a few days back... Well the movie was mediocre wif a few corny jokes a little here and there but I guess I enjoyed the company more than the movie... Everything juz seems better wif that person... Hahaz... Anywayz back to the main point, the day totally ROCKED... Lets start fro mthe beginning~~~.... *cloud thingy* *back to 7 hours ago as of 1820*  Well I know I reached the destination a bit earlier but its a lot better than being late.. Hahaz so i juz entertained myself for a little while... Well she was a bit late but then i still can't blame her cuz its the first time she tried taking mrt from Novena to Choa Chu Kang ar... So wells at least I got to watch a few movie trailers before she arrived... Which after she did we quickly secured seats for the movie we planned to watch. Yep..   Shortly after, time about 12 o'clock? We had lunch at the food court after serious warnings from her not to eat any fried food becuz of my health condition cuz i ain't exactly feeling well these few days... Yep, still had to force myself out cuz I wanted to go out wif her ar... *giggles* Well she did ask me to sue that noodle stall man for giving me spicy noodles though I din say I wanted it, then again, I din say I dun want it either... However judging by the fact that I dun eat chilli, I dun think would haf ordered Meepok wif chilli either... Oh wells... at least got a bit of pity from her while she watched me suffer the spicy-ness... After I finished the noodles, she sorta gave me a script to look through, well a script for her play to be more specific... Well I looked through and gave quite a balanced comment i guess but juz couldn't figure out a way to improve it... Maybe when the effects of panadol go off i'll be able to think of one... Hahaz~  Well after lunch, we headed off looking for some tidbits to sneak into the cinema, I guess she managed to convince me that strepsils is much better for my present health.. oh wells... Next came the highlight of the day? Watching the movie wif her... Hehe... Well the movie isn't that fantastic, guess had too high expectations of it... But Dumbledore looks kinda funky now that they changed the person... *Shrug* Shall not say much mushy stuff here... Hehe.. But oh well i more of enjoyed the company than the movie actually...   Ok after the movie, we went to play arcade? hahaz... I know wat u guys gonna say, trying to say I pulled her in right? Just the opposite, I got pulled in instead... hahaz... And yep i got thrashed in all the games by her... Either I died first or she just kept winning... Hahahaz~ Well a nice game though~ And yep I kinda respected her decision and din force her to take neoprint la.. Anywayz there'll be a chance one month plus from now though... LOL~   Well we then headed somewhere else before heading home but thats not the opint, the point was while we were waiting at the interchange for the bus, there was this gal in front of us who looked like she was preparing for world war 3 wif all the stuff she was carrying and yep, cuz she entered the queue b4 us we juz had fun in the sun while waiting for the bus... Well when the bus did arrive after a long while, she started picking up all her stuff... The funny part is when she finally did pick up her stuff, the bus driver left without us... Yep u heard me... She was more of hidden behind the pillar, and thus, no one noticed us.... Poor things... Well after another long while when the 2nd bus came, we both had a similar thot, wat if this bus driver was also tired of waiting and drove off again? Would haf been the joke of the century manz.... Well thank god he didn't drive away... Hahaz~   Well I had fun today~ Hope she did too, hehe! =) my temperature's rising again... Gotta go peeps!

      Muahahaha~! Hehehe~! Whahaahahaha~! *laughing continues for quite a long time*  YAY!! i got a date wif *ahem* somebody!!! Woo~! I mean its been a long time since i last went out wif her mah... Considering her busy schedule, its so nice for her to make time out to go out wif me i guess.... Hahahaha~! And we're gonna watch harry potter!! Kinda came as a shock when she said she wanted to watch it... Hahahahaz~!   Well first of all i muz thank Fernz man... I mean I almost didn't get to go out cuz of my dumbness cuz i went for the literal part that *ahem* somebody wanted to watch the movie together wif my cliques... hahahaz.. then after i said I'll look for a few frenz to go along I never received a reply back!! Which is scary lar.... Until next morning, by following Fernz advice I said no one wanted to go with me, then *ahem* somebody quickly asked me out wif her alone!! Whee~ A big thank you to you Fern!!! *bows*  Well after that episode of excitement, I muz say i'm looking forward to tuesday and wednesday, cuz i get to call *ahem* somebody on tuesday night and Wednesday I'm most likely going out wif her!! Muahahah!  Well ok, today i went to Jia Lin's house after much persuasion from a lot of pple( the word here should be forced, but since this should sound funny, I chose the word persuaded instead) =) Well first we watched a movie, and subsequently went bowling at her house, in between some exchanges wif the hamsters in her living room. Haha... oh well, my bowling sucked, either it was becuz my whole body was aching, or i juz sucked today... Haha, crapped too much i guess... (But then again, how can anyone crap too little? =/)oh well.. then after bowling we went to a table at the swimming pool, discussing about wat to do on tuesday, though i am reluctant, I guess i'm 'persuaded' yet again... oh well, their gonna discuss it on msn tonite...   Oh yea... Stay cool pple! haf fun! grr.. Body aches and sickness are killing me, on a sidenote, i was sick the last few days, hahaz! bye peeps! *vanishes*

      Whee~! *bounces* Today was such a fruitful day man, finally settled the presents for *ahem* somebody~ lol! Well buying gifts is like so much easier wif fel since shes knows orchard road so much better than i do, but heck! I got the presents, I got the presents!   Come on everyone chant wif me, " He got the presents, He got the presents!" Hehe... *chanting is heard thruout the world* Whoa that was a large effect... I thank u all for your effort! *bows*  Well in case ur wondering, the presents consisted of a glass bottle, of which i'm going to fold stars and put into(though i'm struggling wif it), a handphone string made at Beads etc. at heeren and also a card that i'll to concentrate my lame powers into to make any room sub zero within a matter of seconds. Though i thought drawing one would be easier to be more customised but yar... I'll try it next year... lol~ Sorry but u are talking to a guy who cant draw for nuts! Well peas for that matter too! =P   Well after that i kinda treated fel to fries at mos for helping me out today, and kinda found out that strawberries can be frozen into ice, like u know rock hard! kinda taste quite alright i guess? hehex...  Ah yes, after waiting patiently at home after my parting wif fel, i finally had my friendship band tied to my pencil case by yet again, fel... Thanks Butt(aka fel, incorrect spelling of budd, but then again, this is my world ;D)!

           Yo yoz everyone, today's the first day of blogging with not much memories... As usual considering my very bad memory. Well to all whos reading this, Welcome to the magical world of me, me, me and me. So get comfortable and get used to Magical me...        Ok, my first memory, hmmm... i was playing badminton with Jia Lin, Kingsley, and Jessica. Well they played not bad ya know, well when the 3 of them teamed up against me of course, had a hard time keeping up wif the shots, whahaz... In case YOU haven realised, I am quite good at badminton!! =) and several other sports too!! ^^ yea no kidding! Well in a nutshell they are squash and badminton, ok maybe a teeny weeny bit of tennis too... hahaz~ After badminton, we left for burger king, hmmm... did i crack lame jokes at Jia lin during that time? guess so la... Well most likely... Hahahaz~ Almost watched "Friday" under the instigation of Jia Lin ( FYI that meant the movie 'The day after tomorrow') but we settled for arcade instead where she finally repaid the kindness i bestowed upon her during the schooldays by providing her a free morning call every morning at the time of her choice.... Sad life but oh wellz~ very sad case!!       Well we then went over to my house and tried to get some work done but u know wif Jia Lin around, it'll be a miracle to actually get any done unless shes stops toking.. WHAHAHAZ.. OK.. maybe i did start a few lame jokes too but thats not the point!! The point is i'm biased against u, so there! Well we tried to play squash after the deadlock wif the stupid Maths Assignment 6!! tried to do one bloody question one hour but u know the rest... Not that i didn't want to do it, I couldn't cuz the teacher didn't want me to... =X         Oh well, muz dedicate this last bit to Fernz ar, she was the one who kinda got me started this blog.. haha!! So there! i mentioned u in my blog!! Whee~~ Byez everyone~ My eyes feel heavy...

      Okz this is going to be the worst blog entry ever to you guys man~ Cuz i'm juz going to rant and rant~   Well these few weeks muz be the craziest of my life... I dunno how i'm going to survive till August the third but i'll figure out somehow, no matter wat... Well an unlucky week i would say, at lesat one bad thing happening a day~ I'm on the verge of whacking some of my classmates for being so annoying... Argh~ hate it~ Well thats y i came out wif this abbreviation, ICSGAK, stands for I Can't Stand Glen And Kelvin... Desmond dun laugh... ur almost there... Well Glen would be a long time hatred, had a bit of revenge on him but i figured it may never enuff considering his level of irritating-ness. Whereas Kelvin is a real pain in the *censored for those under 18* butt~ *pretend... use your imagination*  "I'm so tired! I'm so stressed! My CCA is so cham!"  Favourite words of that idiot~ I mean for the record Kelvin is a school councellor, think he got the post of treasurer too~ Digressing a little, hes a real pain... But thats not the point, the point is he earns a hefty 9 points at least within his 2 years of cca... Well being a councellor was a personal choice of his so he should be glad to be one right? It ain't easy to be councellor, that i'll guarantee, still its ur choice, u live by it and not show off the amount of work u haf to do and the amount of points u get...  And so this morning when i finally had enough when he tried complaining to me, I cut into his sentence:   Idiot:Argh~! I'm so stres-...  Me:Shuddup~  Idiot:U know i got a very heavy workload? I am like so stressed sia~ so damn tired~  Me:Stop whining alright, everyone is also tired, everyone in the whole school is tired too for that matter. We didn't force u to be councellor hor, u made the choice u live by it, cannot cope then quit lar.... And for that matter, ur cca is mainly paperwork, i've seen others making ends meet so u dun tell me ur stressed lor and for that matter, those in the sports ccas are training harder, longer and more physically strained than u are and we still complete most of our work on time, so dun u dare say u are tired...  Idiot:*turns away and tries to start a conv wif another classmate*  Me: STOP COMPLAINING LAR! WE'RE IN A MIDDLE OF A LECTURE GOD DAMN IT!!  Idiot:I wasn't complaing to u wat, I was juz telling derrick how much work i have...  Me and a few others:Unfortunately I can still hear u so u better stop it...  Well he did stop for a while~but later on we went for chem tutorial, Mr. Suren promised a lunch treat to whoever could name one of the organic compound, both me and idiot were pretty close to the answer, though i muz say he was much closer to it... but still, no prize to either of us even though his mistake was juz the first number of the compound...  Idiot: AHHHH!!!!! WAH LAU!! i ALMOST GOT IT!! AHHHHHH!!!! *screams and shrieking continues....  Me: Hey stop it lor, ur ,aking too much a fuss about it ba, i mean no one else in the class had such a reaction lor....  Idiot: I could have gotten a free lunch!!! It was juz one number!! Just one number onli leh!!! Kao!!! I thought i could do without my wallet for lunch one ler!!! *shriek*  Me: SO this is all about the free lunch? Get a life, first of all are u so poor(for the record he isn't poor) that u cant even afford a simple lunch? juz haf some simple fare will do lor...   Idiot: My lunch....  Get my point? So bloody irritating... Maybe i should show him wat happens when pple piss me off~ I haf shown it once, I wun mind doing it again~ I will name it, The 'Cleansing'. or should it be The Holocaust? either way, he who offends me shalt perish~   Well and Britsh council was a real bore cuz the thing i live for, vocab game has been scraped by the tcher, so boring now and i din get to sit wif my usual crap group, was facing a group of dead people who wouldn't even recognise a joke even if it danced naked in front of them~ that sad~ hai... loads of other stuff lar~  and yep i onli haf 7 usable fingers due to an unfortunate accident during PE~ shan't tok about it, will onli make me depressed~ cuz aiya I guess muz haf been becuz of *ahem* somebody... Shan't elaborate.... Closer frenz may ask and find out~   CIao~ good luck to all taking oral tmr~!

      Ok I know this has been a long wait for everyone of you people hoping for another post to appear, nonetheless i'm back after a very long wait.. but since this is my blog, I am of course flawless, I'm the most perfect, I'm the almighty, I'm SUPREME!!! Muahahaha... *Power ranger song in the background*  *ahem*Ok back to serious buisness, First week of school just ended and i wished i was never born!!! My gawd... I come back to school onliz got 4 things thrown at me by JC life... Like right in my face, right in the middle.... *sayang* ANYWAYZ, they are none other than a new physics teacher, A level Cl Oral, Common test results, Promo and A level Cl Listening and taekwondo grading.... Yes yes i know u all are gonna say "But thats 5 things!!"  My answer is simple, 5 is a 4 letter word! ^^ too bad, this is my world, my rules! Thou shalt obey~   OK lets start wif the physics tcher, I muz say the other 6 classes who received a new tcher greatly welcomed him, but when it came to my class... there was a unaminous reaction to the tcher when he was intorduced... Take a guess~ "WAH SIAN!!!" yep, u guessed it... Well we juz like the previous one better... And this teacher the colour he chooses for accesories, pretty much make us doubtful of his real intentions... since everything seems to be of bright colours ar... Oh well his teachings, not that fantastic but passable...  Urgh... shall not talk about *censored* Its a sin to talk about *censored*. Since I haven't done it for 6 months since june last year....hmm... trying to make it work but oh well *censored* is real hard in JC, so hard to find a good partner... Yep a good partner to do *censored* togerther wif. I muz say this language is a hard one to master right now, high standards... scary...Haiz~ Chinese~...  My common test results? a total disaster, though maths and econs i felt that they were pretty well done, the rest were like so poor... well I pretty much failed 5 subjects if considered that the school onli accepts C grades and above as passes... Argh.. hate it hate it hate it~  Hmm~ ok last but not least, my greading~ heh... going to be a yellow tip soon~ muahahaha~ I mean its like whoa! though i suck at taekwondo, cant kick for nuts man.... even if i do hit, the strength and technique ain't there~ ahh!!!!! torture~ but nvm muz jia you~~!! Though i muz say that i muz be the worst TKD ever that joined...  Hmmm~ theres bowling open tmr~ think my team is great~ Theres Sociable Sook Fern, Yelping Yvonne(not sure whether theres such a word but this is my world ;P), silent killer shirlyn and last but not least, Marvelous Me! oh wells... I'm thinking i mite not perform up to their expectations...but oh well i'll try my best... cannot let the team down, since they chose me after all...   hehe... something cheerful was *ahem* sombody said i'm a prince charming!! muahahah! and this morning i was given a lift to school by the JJ auntie selling waffle... She kindly offered me and another guy cuz it was pretty much raining and she saw us... I reached the school at a record timing of 6:40... kinda scary.. but at least had a bit of time to do my stuff... ha... and i was thinking how i was prevent my hair from getting wet... heh... aiya~ but then i kinda expected the day would be quite bad, since everything started on a bad note, like say missing the first bus even if i was at the bus earlier than usual, after which it started to haf a thunderstorm.... then during break i actually misplaced my wallet, luckily my fren kept it for me... was so worried, had the precious picture inside... hengz... well and chem expt was a disaster... argh... shall carry on tmr anywayz... needa slp nitez all~ Jia you team!
