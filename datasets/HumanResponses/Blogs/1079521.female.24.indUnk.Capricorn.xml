      Hot damn!  Technically, I only have 33 hours left of my 320 to work for the semester!  How cool is that?  I can take a whole week off if I wanted too.  I'm sure I'll end up working more than that, just out of boredom, and cuz I'm nice, but still.  That's awesome.  I don't have to worrk about working any more Fridays, and I can take a long weekend and go somewhere, if I wanted to!!  Sko.   Homecoming is over!!!!  Waiting to hear from Justin to see if we're gonna "hang out" tonight, or possibly tomorrow.  Nothing from David yet either, I bet he chickens out again and doesn't call me.  I have his cell number, I should totally shock the hell out of him and call him.  =)  Katherine had a great idea, if he were actually using his cell over here (it's out of local range), if he should call, I should have Justin answer it.  No, that'd be mean to Justin.  And he might get the wrong idea.   I hung out with our interim assistant director of Student Life at the bonfire, and he was asking me all about why I came, blah blah.  (he's an APSU alum, and a Pike alum too), and he was amazed at the fact that I came all this way to Austin Peay for grad school.  I'm his new hero or something.  So, a bunch of them were asking how I came over here knowing no one, and I told them, that I did know someone, a boyfriend, and then they wanted the whole story (this was a bunch of guys, college age and alumni age) and they were like "I can't believe that!  He didn't do that right when you moved did he?  What an ass!  I'm so glad you showed him and stayed.. blah blah blah."  It was really kind of neat, all these people were like "you're so awesome to have moved so far away like that and stuck it out"  Then later Sean (the assistant director guy) comes up to me, or I guess it was this am at the parade line up, and says "remember that guy so and so that I was talking to last night about you being all the way from NC, well he came up to me later wanting to know more about you and wanting info, and I said 'Nope, leave me out of it, you're going to have to go talk to her yourself so if he does, that's who it is and that's all I know".   Hm, they're coming out of the woodwork here all of a sudden.   I got invited to some of the frat parties tonight too, but was like "eh, no, not by myself thank you very much"    So, I'm just being a bum here waiting on Justin to call.  I need to go take a shower, cuz it was freakin' 85* & hotter than blazes today, and I have layers of sweat and grossness on me!  It felt like August out there today, I should have had on shorts!  Holy smokes.  Poor band peoples!    Ok, well, I'm on a roll, so here's all the homecoming details.  Friday I ended up having to go in at 11am.. oh fun!  We had a Greek Step Off at noon, and other randomness through out the afternoon.  Then, a 4 we had homecoming court practice for about an hour and a half, then GHOST (trick-or-treating for the kiddos) till about 7.  I actually didn't have to end up being there for that, but I stayed cuz I didn't feel like driving back and forth.  Justin called me at some point during that time and we chatted for a while while I took a break.. he said "man, that sucks that you have to work, tonight would be a nice night to chill out on the couch and watch movies"  fooey.   SO, then we headed to the bonfire, which was a disaster.  They forgot to soak the wood, so I had to sprint over to our office (a good ways away) and get lighter fluid that we just happened to have from some cookout in August.  It didn't burn well or big at all.  Kinda sucky.  I remember at App it heated the whole field the thing was so big!  And, we wer eunder the bright field lights, so it was like it was daylight!  What the hell?  Then we milled around till time for the comedy show.  OH, in between then, I had to sprint around campus a few other times, to find misplaced food for the comics and something else.  I got my workout running all over the place.  The comedians didn't start on time, and I wasn't too impressed with them.  Too much foul language and stuff.  Last year they were funnier.  They were being asses too, they randomly asked for a DJ, and then one didn't give him a list of what and when to play, so he was making fun of the DJ for not knowing what was going on.  The same host is hosting the step show tonight, and he was trying to start some trouble with one of the black frats.. some song that is not allowed to be played on campus anymore, cuz it's "their" song, and last time someone played it, another black frat tried to step to it and a big fight broke out.  SO, this comedian that is hosting the step show was going to get an earfull from the assist VP of the university about what he could and couldn't say.  I hope it ends up ok.  The show sold out, 800 ish people, it could get ugly.  THere are probably 100 police there.  I'm glad I didn't have to work that one.  I'd love to see them all step, but that's too many people if something does get started.  It's a mess.  Uh..  Today was the parade starting at 8:30 for line up.  I was in charge of the court getting in their cars.  A lot of the people were throwing beads, so I ended up with a TON of them around my neck, got pelted with candy.  Ow!  The Humane Society was in the parade too, with all sorts of dogs in costumes and stuff, it was so cute.  There were 2 weiner dogs.  Aww.   That got done earlier than we thought, and then we had 2 hours off, so I came home and took a shower and relaxed for a while.  Then, back in "nice" clothes to the tail gate and game.  We had to pin flowers on the whole court and their escorts, line them up, make sure they made their pretty arc on the field, etc.  It was neat.  I knew who won before they announced it, so that was neat, to be able to watch her reaction.  It was someone that works in our office, who is pretty decent.   Then after that I had to go sit around and wait for the "family fiesta" to get started.  It was all set up when I got over there, so we just sat around.  It lasted entirely too long, if you ask me.  The last hour went by sooooo sloooowly.  But, now I've gotten a second wind, and if I dn't do something soon, I think I'll crash.  But, I want to stay awake, so Justin can come up and hang out.  fer de fer.  Might have to wait until tomorrow.  Oh well.  Ok, gonna take my 3rd shower of the day cuz I still feel gross.   oh yeah, the football team actually won, 17-0!!  I think they're 4-6 now.  Poor things.  That's what happens when you don't give fb scholarships!!

      UGH!  Friggen cough!  I've got my nasty coughing attacks back!!!!  I guess maybe I'm going to have to go to the dr and have it checked out.  What a freakin' pain in the arse.  AND, I have to stay till the comedy show is over tomorrow night, which will be like 11pm-  "just in case".  Well shit.  Hopefully I can get Justin to just come up Saturday evening.  He could come up for all the stuff tomorrow, but it's not like we'd get to spend any quality time together.  Fer de fer.   My freakin' counseling client didn't show up today, what a pain in the ass.  No call, no email, NOTHING.  Jeez, that means I'm going to have to find someone new, just what I have time to do.  Ugh.  I hate people sometimes.  As Carmen says, they should get points taken away for not showing up and wasting our time.   Oh, another joy of joys, I have to be in to work at 11 tomorrow morning, instead of 3pm.  There's another 12 hour shift.  I'll have a whole week off just from working 2 days.  I fully intend to use it too.  I might take off the whole week next week, dammit.  I'm in a bit of a pissy mood, can you tell?   Growl. It'd be different if people cared about Homecoming, and got into it.  But it's just not worth all this fuss when the only people that show up are the same handful of people.  Oh well.  I've met lots of fun people, so I spose it's all good.  I think I'd be less pissy if I weren't sick yet again.     I've decided I'm taking Monday and Wednesday off.  Not Tuesday cuz I have class all day, so it wouldn't count.  That'll be nice.  I can get some of my papers all finished up, work on a project for my crazy web class.. oy.

      Heh.    EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE    Yay for another happy phone call with  Justin.  tee heee.  He called me while I was working at the Variety Show tonight for Homecoming stuff, and when I checked my phone walking to my car I was like "aww, I have a message from Justin!" Cute.  So, we just kinda talked about everything and nothing in particular.  I have no idea how we got onto some of the topics we did, but it was just one of those conversations.  He right off the bat wanted to know if I would be able to hang out Friday night, and he said I was invited to go to a cookout with him on Saturday, but that it was at 5 so he figured I wouldn't be able to get there before it was over.  So, I told him he could come up here after that, cuz I'd be done around 7ish.  He said that could work, and he'd definitely give me a call when he was done.  Then later in the conversation he kept mentioning to be sure to check my schedule and see if I would be free Firday night.  Crazy crazy.   Then, he was talking about work and getting stuff done and being sarcastic about how hard his life is, and I said "well, feel free to come up here and go to class for me, and I'll go do your work" or something like that and his response was "well, I'd definitely like to come spend some time up there, but for reasons other than intellectual/class things, if you know what I mean"  Oh boy, take that and run with it.   I think that was the most direct "Yes I like you" statment he's made.  Hot damn.  So, I'm going to check tomorrow and see what my duties are for Friday night at the comedy show.  Maybe I'll just have to take tickets, and can sit and enjoy the show once that is done, so perhaps he can come up and do that with me.  Still not necessarily alone, but we could do something after, except for the fact that I have to be up at the ass crack of dawn the next day.  Freakin' homecoming interfering with my life!!  Hopefully I can convince him to come up Saturday night, especially since he wants to see me this weekend, and if I can't do anything Friday.. I think he'll make it a point to come after his cookout thingy.   ;-)  Rock on.  I'm going to be smiling like a tard all day tomorrow.    What else?  I'm still working on getting rid of whatever sickness I've gotten this time.  It's turning into more of a cough thing again, let's hope it stops soon and I don't end up with pneumonia again, dammit.  Blargh.   I have to do counseling and supervision tomorrow starting at noon.. then I'm free till about 7, I think.  ROck on. I wish my schedule was like this every week!  Altho, after this weekend, I bet I'll be damn close to my total number of hours.  We only work thru November 30 (or that's our last pay period- we have to get 320 hours in, and once we do that, we're done).  So that'll be nice.  I might actually not have to work at all in December.    Uh.. that's about it. I need to go to bed.  I was supposed to be working on transcripts, but that didnt happen.  Now I'll have to get up and do it in the am.  yuk.   Night night, sleep tight!!    EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

      Ok, welcome to the newer, "privater" blog.  Just in case... now only the coolest people can read what I'm writing.  heheh.   Dag nabbit!  Why do I keep getting sick?  What is this?  I woke up this am with a HORRIBLE headache, and sore all over.  I have no idea why, I mean I've slept most of the weekend away, and even though I was out late 2 nights, I still more than made up for it.  Ugh.  I've had it with this.    Uh, what else.  I spent till the wee hours of the morning Sat night/Sunday am with Justin and 2 of his hs buddies, and then Sunday night till about midnight with him, Robin, Mike and various others carving pumpkins and bobbing for apples and stuff.  Complete with Amy and Katherine type prodding from Robin!   ;-)  LOL.  Mike was asking me what Justin and I did Saturday night, and he said something like "Man, he's always got to have other people around", and I said yeah, I've noticed that, and both Mike & Robin said it's cuz he's nervous.  Aww, how cute!  But it's time to get over the nervousness!  lol.  No, it's cute, I totally understand, but boys are not posed to be nervous.  I supposed that's some double standard I'm invoking, but that's just how I see it.  Perhaps I will have to make myself more obvious or something.  Robin asked us when we were going out again, and he was like "well, it's up to her since she has to work a million and a half hours next weekend".  So, perhaps if it's up to me, I can convince him to get his butt up here and hang out Saturday after the game.  When we left Robin & MIkes Sunday night, he asked if it was ok if he called me during the week, how cute is that?  Of course I said "YES!  I'll be looking forward to it".  Baby steps.. I guess I'm just used to guys who put themselves right out there.  Who knows.    So when we were out Saturday night, his friends were waiting outside a bar in downtown Nashville and when we walked up they were like "Well, look at Justin showing up with the cute girl!"   And one of them was trying to "sign" something to me over Justin's head at one point, but I didn't get what he was saying, something about the 2 of us, I guess.  I wonder what he told them, like who I was when he told them I was coming along.  They knew I was coming in advance, cuz when he was talking to them on the phone he kept saying "yeah, we'll be there soon".  So, I wonder how he described me to them...  interesting.  Then after he made sure I was ok to drive back to Clarksville that late, he tells me to call as soon as I get back so he knows I made it ok.  Aww, how sweet!!   Sunday night, during the Halloween festivities, Paul came.  He called Robin a while before he came, and wanted to talk to Justin, and Robin was making strange facial expressions at him, I couldn't tell what they were talking about.  But, Mike & Robin made several comments while Paul was out of the room like "well, now that Paul's not here, when are you 2 going out again, what's the deal".  And, Paul said something about "justin do this for your woman"  So I'm not sure what that's about.   But, he's after Robin's cousin that goes to Belmont, so maybe he's over it now.   The other night, when I got home at like 3 am, David was online and IMs me "What are you still doing up?"  So, I told him I had just gotten back from Nashville with Justin and then asked him what he was doing.. and he tells me he just took a friend home, so I asked more questions and found out it was his ex from like 3 years ago, Caren.  So, I was asking what was going on with that, cuz he's decided he's in love with her again, but she's apparantly happy with her current bf.  So, he proceeded to tell me all that was going on with that, and then halfway into it, he asks "do you really want to hear all this" and I said "I don't really care, if you want to tell me, whatever".  So, he tells me blah blah blah, she kissed him but then told him nothing could happen cuz she's really happy where she is now, bad timing, they've missed each other.  And, I'm happy to report, that I had no negative reaction what-so-ever.  It didn't bug me, piss me off, upset me, or ANYTHING.  I've been kind of thinking that it wouldn't, cuz he's mentioned other girls before, but I totally don't care.   I have no desire to ever even think about us getting back together, or not wanting him to date anyone else, nothing.  I could care less who he's with and what he's doing with them.  That's such a nice feeling.   He's supposed to be coming to Nashville next weekend, and wants me to come meet up with him, but I'm not sure if I'll have time with all the homecoming stuff, and Justin get's priority over him, so if I can get him to come up to Clarksville and hang out Saturday night, then screw David.  =)  I do, however want to see him soon.  Just to see him face to face and see if it feels worth it to continue working on being friends.  I am 99.9% sure that I will have no reaction when I see him either.. which is why I think I'm looking forward to it.  I know he's nervous, Robin has told me that much.  But, tough for him.  It's nice to have that control.  Now he's the one that wants to see me, and I hold the control.  hahahaha.   Anyway. So, I think it's safe to say that I am 100% over this, finally & officially.  I look forward, if he's capable of it, to being friends and talking about stuff and seeing each other randomly, and hanging out like I do with other friends.   So, we'll see.   Happy day.  Needless to say I wasn't super productive with all my days off.  I slept till at least noon every day, and then putzed around for a while and then ended up going out.  Ack.  So I have to finish my test review questions so I can study when I get home from working tonight.  I think tonight is War of the Wings and Chariot Races, ooh fun!

      I totally forgot I was going to write this.  Yesterday was 10 years ago to the day that I moved to NC.  Well, we left our house in NY on November 7, I guess we didn't really move in until the 8th or 9th.. but you get the idea.  That's the date that is ingrained in my head.  Man, it does and doesn't seem that long ago.  10 years seems like a lifetime.  But, I've still lived in NY longer than NC, so I'm not technically a southerner yet. ;-)

      Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, it's 48* today!  Holy cow.  Time to get out the warm snuggly sweaters!  I might actually need to turn on my heat.  I hope it works, I havne't tested it out!!  I've been snuggling in my bed all day, with the elec blanket on.  I wish I had a fire place to sit in front of!!  I really want to decorate for Christmas now that it's cold!!    I'm going on a date tonight, with Justin, dinner & a movie.  Aw, how cute.  We're going to see "elf' with Will Ferrel from SNL.  Should be fun.  We were talking on Thurs trying to decide what to do, and he was like well, we could do this Friday and this Saturday...  I couldn't come over Friday cuz he wouldn't have time to clean up, blah blah.  How cute is that??  Ok, I've gotta hit the gym before it gets crowded.

      I just saw a countdown to Christmas on some website.. and it's only 50 days!  Zut, that'll go by so quickly!  AND, that means only 47 till my birfday.  I'm going to be 24, holy crap!  I'M OLD!!!!!    It got cool today, man it felt so nice!  No more freakin' 80* days.  It's gonna be mid 60's or lower for the rest of the week, finally, some real fall-ish weather.  Maybe I'll get to wear fun sweaters before Thanksgiving!!   That's about it.. nothing profound.  I've felt very out of touch with reality the last few days, and like something is missing/antsy.  I can't put my finger on it.  I guess after going going going for 4 days straight, I don't know what to do with all my free time.  Weird, isn't it?   I dunno, I feel like I'm waiting for something to happen or come up.  I guess in a sense, I am.. Blargh.

      Doo be doooo.  Man, it's been nice not working for 2 days.  I slept in and got stuff done for ME!  Including some Christmas shopping.  Rock on.  That's about it, really.  I think I've decided to skip out on 2 classes and come home for a whole week at Thanksgiving.. we'll see.  I haven't misssed either class I'd be skipping out on yet this semester, so it's only fair.  And I know we'll end up doing nothing much in either class.. so we'll see.  There is KKPsi stuff going on the weekend before, that I'd really like to go to, so that's influincing my decision.  We'll see.  It also depends on developments with Justin.  Cross fingers that we'll actually get to do something fun this weekend, and not watch a movie half falling asleep.   Uh.. I'm at a loss of what to write.  derderderder..  Ok, so I guess that's it for now.

      Well, I'll be.  I have a ton to write and update you on!  I need one of those programs that you can talk to and it'll type up what you say!  I'll have to do this in shifts, probably.  Ok, we'll start with someting a little different, and VERY interesting.  Saturday night, about 10ish,  I guess it was, I see David pop online (he was in Nashville this weekend, in case you've forgotten, and staying with Robin & Mike)  So, he gets on, and I have my "very cute boy is on his way to see me!!" message up. So, 5 mins goes by, and he IMs me "NO!  You're supposed to be coming here tonight!  The 2 of you come back to Nashville!!"  I came back from cleaning up something and see this and said something like "I am?  I didn't know that"  Cuz he was supposed to call me, we had talked about me coming down there Sat night, but I was waiting for him to get over himself and call me. So, I said,  no, sorry, Justin is on his way up, and I'm in no condition to have to drive to/from Nashville.  So he and/or Robin suggests that I come down Sunday am for breakfast.  So I figgured what the hey, it'll be easier to do that then trying to find some other time to see him when I'm home.  I guess I can give up my day to sleep in.  Plus, then I could hang out for the afternoon with Robin & Mike & Justin and stuff.  Fun.  So, anyway, he then says something like "oh I know why you want to come down tomorrow, Justin is gonna be here all day!"  (I didn't know, but figured he'd be around)  Then Justin got here so I quickly signed off.  (He & Robin took that as they pissed me off, and called later to make sure.. I just told them no IMer messed up)  So, I get my butt out of bed SUnday am to be there around 9.  Holy moly, that was not a fun time getting up, since I didn't go to bed till about 3.  So, I honestly didn't think anything of it, I got a little "nervous" but not really nervous as I got closer to Robin's house, but that was it.  So, I get there, and am getting the dogs out of the car and he comes out and says hello.  I gave him a little hug, and that was that.  He was very quiet, walked around, looked at the car, played with the dogs, blah blah blah.  He really didn't say much at all, which is very unusual, and was antsy.  He asked about the car and if it was all fixed, talked about Melly and his trip over, nothing too spectacular.  We ate breakfast, and then sat in the living room and all talked.  It was very ant-climatic.  He was just weird.  I, on the ohter hand, was totally fine, and ready to have a normal conversation, joke around, etc.  Whatever.  He had to leave at 11 to go to church with the Terrys, so he did, and I got a "it was good to see you" and a real hug this time.    Ok, here is where it gets interesting.  After he left, Robin says "well, how was that?" and I said "that's the quietest I've ever seen him!  What'd you do to him?  heheh.. so they tell me- starting with last night:  Justin called Robin to ask her the best way to get to 24 from his house, so David knew that Justin was coming to my place. So, that started it.  Robin said from that point on, he was antsy and figity and was trying to come up with a reason to get online to see what I was doing.  So, he finally did, and the first thing he did was check my away message, and/or see what I was doing.  They both said "It burned him up" to see that and to talk to you about Justin coming up and hanging out.  He was torn up and didn't know what to do with himself.  And, then once we planned breakfast,  he was even more nervous.  Then, they said from the time he got up Sunday morning, he'd been pacing, figiting, and didn't know what to do with himself waiting for me to get there.  Interesting, huh?   I don't know if the rest is what they inferred, or something he actually told them, but Robin & Mike both said that he just couldn't deal with the fact that I was over it, and able to move on, because he isn't as much as he wants to be or claims to be.  He totally can't deal with the fact that I'm happy and excited and don't have any outward appearance of still being hung up on him.  HAHAHAHAHAH!  I win I win I win!  I kinda figured as much, but hearing it from them just made my day.  I wonder if he'll say anything to Robin about what it was like to see me?!  I think it'd be funny as hell, if he was the one that ended up having some sort of feelings come up, since I was the one worried about that.  SPeaking of which.. I'm happy to say I had no emotional reaction, as I knew I wouldn't.  I had to keep looking at hime and was like "wow, I dated him? Why?"   Or he'd say something and I was just like, "what on earth did I see in that?"  It was weird.  best test:  he was sitting on the couch playing RObin's guitar and singing... NO REACTION, even to that.  It was weird, and like I say, anti climatic.  I was hoping for more of a reaction from him, other than wanting to see my new tattoo and saying it looked good there, better than he thought it would.  No sensation at all when he hugged me.  I am a little disappointed in his "reaction" in that he couldn't really directly talk to me the same way he could Robin & Mike, but I guess that goes with him not being over things yet.  He did say something about me coming to visit him when I'm home next time.  I don't know if it was 100% real or not, but I might take him up on it, like over Christmas, just to see if it's different when there isn't an audience, so we'd have to talk directly.   I think I got more out of RObin & Mike telling me what he was like before I was there, than I did out of seeing him.    But, I'm glad I got to see him and validate that I'm over him and have no emotional connection left.   No monumental developments with Justin.. he did indeed come up Saturday night, didn't get here till close to 11, I think.  So, he was only here for a little bit, and we watched a movie and that was about it.  Had some interesting conversation with Robin about that too.. she was asking me if she needed to get us some tootsie rolls (that's how she and Mike first kissed, sharing a tootsie roll.. so that's the running joke between everyone) and I said, well, I certainly wouldn't have any objections.  Then later she pulled Justin into the kitchen and asked him something (about me/him) and he was like "no, no, not yet") and she says "well why the hell not"  So, I'm not sure what exactly that was about, but perhaps it was a push in the right direction. Who knows.   He made several comments over the past week that inferred things, so... whatever.   next weekend I have NOTHING to do, so perhaps we can try the movie night idea again.   OK, I've got to go be productive!!  I slept till almost 1 today!   More later, perhaps...

      Freakin' state of TN and their retarded laws.  I took the doggies to the kennel, traumatic enough, but then the stupid chick is like "oh, it says here Onex needs a rabies shot"  Um, no.  See, in NC they're intelligent and give 3 year vaccines, so no, she actually doesn't. "Oh, well the TN law says that even  still they need to have it  every year.  We give the same vaccine"  WHAT THE HELL?!  Then why make a vaccine that works that long, it can't be good for the dog if they're getting a 3 year dose every year.  I was like well, what the hell ever, if that's the only way they can stay, then I guess go ahead and do it.  Jesus.  Then she's like "oh, Onex needs kennel cough too"  WHAT?  She got that shit last time and ended up sick.  What the hell?!  That's not a health hazard like rabies is, what the ****!  ARRRRRGH.  SO, a $60 stay is now going to be close to $100 now because of the damn shots that they insist the dogs need.  Forget that.  Any where else I go, they're going to have to go with me, or I'll pay someone to stay with them.  At least that way shots don't freakin' matter.  Jesus.  I was about ready to burst into tears, I didn't want to leave them anyway, and then this shit.   I hate stupid rules.   They're made to be broken.   IT's cold. And Trish just called to say they were just now leaving their house, so it'd be 45mins till they got here!  AHH, I could have gone to the gym.  I still could, for a quick run or something, but no, I"m dressed and ready.  Dammit.  I hate people being late.  IT was too cold and too early when the alarm went off at 6:30 to go then.. I knew I should have just gotten up, so I'd be in a better mood.  Maybe there will be a gym at the hotel that I can go play in.   Ugh.  I really just want to stay home this weekend.  This trip had better be damn fun.

      Dag nabbit.  I knew as soon as I got excited about and started to plan on being able to come home for Thanksgiving early, something would come up.  We have our "final" for one of our counseling techniques classes that Monday.  We have to go teach what we've learned all semester to the intro students.  Dam, that's annoying.  I spose it's better than having to take a final, but does it HAVE to be that day?  Oh well.  I'll just get up at the ass crack of dawn Tuesday am and drive home, so I can have maximum time.  Fer de fer.   This week has been so weird.  I'm just in a weird mood, I guess.  I'm sick of school, and I think I've already mentally checked out of my classes and stuff.  I feel like I'm just going through the motions.  Maybe it's the weather.. it's been dreary lately, and I've noticed that I'm realllllly affected by the weather.  If it's rainy and gross, so am I.  I'm really not all that excited about going to Gatlinburg this weekend.. I'm sure it'll be fun once I get there, but I wish I could bring Carmen along or something.  That, and I have to ride with people I don't know.  Oh that'll be a blast.  Actually, I think I've met one of the people before, but still.  Blah.  I'll have to be sure to bring stuff to work on when all the adults are out having fun.  I need to go to the library tomorrow and get some books.  I FINALLY finished one I've been reading for almost 2 months!  It was good, Flavor of the Month, by Olivia Goldsmith, I think it is.  She also wrote "First Wives Club".  I should see if the lib has that one.   SO, I'm scheming a way to invite Robin, Mike & Justin to come visit me over Christmas break, without making it seem like it's a big deal.  I think it'd be fun, but I don't think any of them could take time off from work, and I don't know that they'd want to do all that driving for a weekend.  You kind of need that 3rd day.  We'll see.    Ok, I've got to get to bed.  I'm so pathetic.  I was dead tired when I got out of bed at 9am today.   OF course I couldn't get to sleep right away either.  I hate that. I think I'm tired enough tonight though that it'll be no problem.  I'm not looking forward to Friday.. we're leaving around 9:30.. which means I"ll have to get up at like 7, to get the dogs to the kennel and me to the gym.  I wish I didn't have to take the doggies, I hate leaving them there.  =(  Off I go!!  See you in my dreams!!

      ERGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Stupid hair cutting people need to learn to not get carried away!!    I went to Fantastic Sams for a "trim", to get my ends cut off.. and I didn't think about it when the woman was asking me how much I wanted off.  She showed me about an inch, which did indeed get all the gross ends off.. but then I forget that when they cut layers back into it, that takes off at least another inch!  AHH!  My hair is too short!  Really, I think it's only about 2 inches, but still!  I've been working so hard at having it long!  Oh well, it's probably at the length it was in the middle of Aug when I last had it cut.. so it'll grow back pretty soon.  Next time though, I'm just asking to have my layers redone.  No cut before hand.  Fer de fer.

      Hm. I'm such a lazy bum on weekends!  I've done NOTHING.  Well, I feel like I've done nothing.  I did laundry, and cleaned a little, and started a quilt, and got some Christmas shopping done (of course I bought just about as much stuff for myself...so does that really count?)  But in terms of "real" work, like school stuff, nothing.  Not that I have a lot to do..  a power point presentation that I've got outlined, and I should polish up my paper that's due next week.  I should get a jump on the next test I have too.. since the last one I totally sucked ass on.  Well, I'm not 100% sure, since we don't get them back till Tuesday, but still.  It's not an A, that's for sure.   I wonder how my paper went.  I get that back Tuesday too, I think.  I want to be done.  I feel like we're just wasting time in class anymore.  Like the professors have nothing planned to teach us.  Monday night we had class for an hour-ish, because we were supposed to watch someone counsel, and that didn't happen, so we had nothing to do.  Then Wednesday it seemed like our professor was just stalling for time so we could stay more than an hour.  I don't get it.  Of course, Tuesdays are always like that, at least at night.  I just want to play around, no more school for the semester.   So, Justin and I went to a movie and dinner, and he paid for both.  We sat for like 2 hours, I guess it was, at dinner, talking about random stuff, and he walked me to my car to make sure the boogity man didn't get me.   It was fun. Then he came up Saturday to watch movies.   Nothing monumental.  I don't know what the deal is.  I guess, based on what Robin has said, he's just very slow in moving things along.  Like maybe he has to know everything about me before he defines anything or does anything?!  Cuz there were plenty of opportunities for hand holding or what-not, and I know he had to notice.  I'm just not quite sure what his deal is.  I mean, it's a long couch, and he could have easily sat in one corner, but he didn't, he sat right next to me, and we were touching, that means something, right? I need some concrete affirmations!  I'm going to have to call & see what Robin has to say, I think.  See if she'll spill any dirt.   What else? :-O  I found the coolest koala sun catchers at Wal Mart tonight.  The make your own kind, I should go do that!  I used to love making those when I was little.  I'm going to send one to my big bro from KKPsi.  Cuteness.  What else did I get when I was shopping tonight?  Some cute little shirts for the girls I babysit, a pair of black jersey pants- they're so comfy!!  Oh, and some cute shirts from Old Navy, for me and for my niece.   Cute cute.  I think that's about it.  Then, I was zoned out driving home, and completely missed my exit off of 24, so I had to go to the next exit, which is 9 miles away to turn around.  Jeez o peez.  What a pain in the butt that was.  I don't know how I missed it, I guess I was day dreaming or something.   I am so ready to go home for Thanksgiving.  Carmen's mom and aunt came to visit her this weekend, and Justin was talking about spending time with his family, and Robin's parents came over the other day when I was there, it made me miss my mom & dad and home.  Actually, I'd prefer my mom come visit me and spend some time here, but that isn't going to happen for a while, unless she brings my grandma with her.  She's coming to stay with them Dec 1 until April sometime.  Maybe they both can come visit.   I'm excited about having  a 5 week Christmas break.. but I'm also kinda worried, especially if nothing spectacular has happened with Justin yet.  I don't want to be gone for 4-5 weeks if things are just beginning to happen!  I was thinking maybe I could invite him, Robin & Mike to come visit for a long weekend.  They love to go on road trips, and it's not that far.  Robin & Mike could see David too.  Might be kind of fun.  I don't know if they can take of a day, cuz that'd be a long trip for just Sat & Sun.   We'll see.   Aw, I'm talking to Alice on the phone now..   and I'm all excited about Christmas break and seeing her!!  YAY!  It's not THAT far away... something to look forward to. ;-)

      YAY.  Robin emailed me back all excited to go ice skating, so we are going sometime on Saturday.  I just found the website to the arena, and it's open for a few hours in the afternoon and a few after dinner time.  So, awesome.  I just talked to Justin again tonight too, and he sounded pretty cool with the idea.  ANd, as Robin says "Ice skating is a hand holding event".  LOL.   Especially since it's been a LONG ASS time since I've ice skated, and might need some help the first few times around.  It always takes me a while to remember how to do it, esp after being so used to rollerblades.  I haven't been ice skating since either senior year in HS or freshman year in college, holy crap. How sad is that?  I remember when we used to go every night in NY.  I miss that, being all bundled up.  IT's back to freakin' 70*!!  I WANT COLD!!  So, yeah.  My client showed up today, he didn't really have much to talk about, but he was a really nice guy.  He was asking me questions about grad school in the middle of the session.  See, they're so fake.   I'm glad it's just about done.  I want to start doing something real.  I need to call the woman back about internships at the girls home, and see if she is still hiring for that.  So I can work on that in the spring and knock out some hours.  I need to find out officially if I can walk in May, with just internship left to do.  There are several other people doing that.. so I see no reason.  As long as I have my paper done too, which I will.   I have NOTHING to do tomorrow.  GOing to sleep in, clean, sew, perhaps do some shopping, and have dinner with Carmen.  I'm excited.  I so didn't want to get out of bed this morning.  It was pretty cool last night, so my room was nice and cool and I was snuggled in my electric blanket.. oooh, so comfy.   OH!  I haven't told you about the latest randomness from David.  He was asking me when I'd be home for break, cuz there is KKPsi stuff this coming weekend.  Then we were talking about what we were doing for Thanksgiving, so I was telling him we'd be in Charlotte, like usual, and telling him about my sister and her crazy random divorce and stuff, so he says "well, if you need to escape the craziness, call me and come on over".  So, I was like "I'll probably go down Wednesday night, and was thinking about giving you a buzz to see if you had some spare time"  He acted all excited about it.  Then, a few days later, he asks again when I'm leaving to come, and says "oh, well I'm sure I'll talk to you before then, but if not, you've got my number right?  Call me when you need a break from family time"  Dude, what's up with that?  I mean, it's one thing to say it once to be "polite" but he's mentioned it 3 times now.  Weird.  I want to see if he's over himself and can talk normally to me over dinner or something.  I bet not.   Ok, I've gotta get the doggies outside and hit the hay.  Big day of NOTHINGNESS tomorrow!

      I do not like Tuesdays, Sam I am!!!  And just think, next semester, they will be replaced with Thursdays!  AHH.  What ijut decided it was fun to torture the grad students by having two 3 hour classes back to back?!  Jeez=o=peez!  And, of course, we stayed the full time for both.  Ugh.   But, at least next semester, they start later, so I can either not work at all before hand, or work and then have a 2-3 hour break before.  That'll be nice.   In terms of rain, I gather from overhearing conversations, that it rained here all weekend, and it is STILL raining.  POURING, as a matter of fact, complete with tornado warnings when I woke up this am.  I have lost a rubbermaid tub that was on my porch.  I don't know if it blew away or if someone took it.. but it's been there forEVER, so I can't imagine someone would just randomly steal it.  My plnts blew all over too, so I'm guessing it blew away.   What else?  Not sure... OH, I know.  I FINALLY got in touch with a 3rd counseling client, so I (hopefully- assuming the guy shows up) won't get an incomplete.  Just have to find time to see him twice and type up the transcripts before the end of the semester, along with all the other shit that is piling up.    Which brings me to this pain in the ass online class.. ok, so we all hade to make power point presentations on a chapter, create an activity for everyone to do, make up a quiz, and come up with a discussion board question.  Well, they're all being turned in at the last minute (imagine that!!), and so I have 10 activities, quizzes, and discussion board questions to do by the end of the semester!  ACK!  That's intelligent.  She should have made them due sporadically throughout the semester.  Jeez, what a freakin' moron.   Anyone got any ideas of how to shut up a loud cat on a 7 hour car ride?  I think I"m going to take Zoe home when I go for THanksviging, so I'll be sure to have enough room to get all the crap I'll want to take for Christmas break.  She "howled" the whole time I had her in the car the other day.  It's damn annoying!!  Uh.. what other happy things can I mention?!  Not sure.  Hopefully I'll talk to Justin in a bit and have some happy news from that.  And, Robin, so we can all do something fun this weekend.  I need to have a chat with Robin, she called the other night and we were talking about Justin, but her phone died, so we didn't get to talk long.   So, we'll see.  I sent her an email asking her what she thought/knew about what's going on.. and if what she was saying was that he wasn't about to make any "first moves"   Ok, little pause there, Justin called. =)  Chatted for a bit, and then he had to go to bed, and was like "well, I"ll give you a call probably tomorrow night or maybe Thursday and see how you're doing and what's up for the weekend".  Cute, all by himself he did that.  Positive sign, I'd say.   Now it's time to wrap up for tonight.  That's all for now.. stay tuned.

      Yay!! I picked up my babies this am.  They were so excited to see me.  Onex whined and cried the whole way home, she was so excited.  Aww.  Then, I had to give them baths cuz they smelled like the kennel.  But, better than having to pay for the kennel to do it. =)  Now, I'm at work, and itchin' to go home so they're not alone all day again.

      Oh my freakin' God.  I hate stupid drivers, and traffic in general.  Holy shit.   Ok, so first there's the Gatlinburg traffic mess.  It's worse than the beach during spring break, traffic backed up, only one main road to get everywhere, up and down "the strip".  It wasn't any where NEAR as bad as it was when I went with Robin, Mike, Paul & Justin, but still.  We actually stayed in downtown Gatlinburg, right on the strip, so we could walk to a lot of places.  BUt the ones that we couldn't, it took like 4 times as long as it should have, based on the distance away it was.   UGH.  And people won't let you turn left across traffic, it's crazy.   THEN, we FINALLY get to 40 and go for maybe an hour and a half, and we come to a HUGE mess, apparantly a tractor trailer wrecked and exploded and completely shut down the interstate   BOTH   ways.  I'm not sure if any thing was moving by the time we hit it, but by the time we got to a place we could detour and find an alternate route.. we called some people that left after us from Gatlinburg, and they were stopped about 50 miles back. JESUS!  That's insane.  So, we found a map and hopped off 40 via an   ON    ramp.. and stopped and reorganized.  I found the alternate route on the map and told them all how we should go, based on that.  Then we had to sit and talk about it for 15 more mins, cuz someone over heard bits of a conversation that said someone took 4 hours to go back roads around it, so some of the people were lik "let's just get a hotel and stay here and leave at the ass crack of dawn".  Uhm, HELL NO. Luckily there were other people that said that as well.  And, once we got going, we were fine.  A few little snag ups at some of the lights, but that's no biggie.  We found the first connection back to 40, but that was still a parking lot, so we went to the next one and it was moving nicely.  So, we were on our way, FINALLY.  We left the hotel at 10am, eastern time, and got home at about 5:30.  Part of that was stopping for breakfast at 2 places cuz the first one had a 90 min wait.  And, then stopping for gas and a potty break.  These people don't get the idea of a "quick stop"!  ERGH.  Oh my goodness.   Other than that, the trip was pretty fun.  I won't do it again anytime soon, at least not with that many people.  I'd be fine going somewhere with just Trish & her family.  But coordinating what 10 people wanted to do, with no definite plan before we got there was no good.  People got ornery, etc.  I finally got to Hard Rock last night, last thing.  We went to the big aquarium, which I ended up having to pay for myself at.  I thought this was an all inclusive trip.. but I guess not.  Whatever.  I'm not doind that again, unless they offer to pay me too, or pay for the dogs.  They were a fun bunch of people tho, and so what we are all going to be like when we're 40.  Loud, crazy, and on crack!!  It's great.  I was thuroughly entertained.  :-)  Now, I have to type up some counseling session transcriptions and head to bed.  I want my puppies!!!  They're still at the kennel, cuz they don't open for pick up on Sundays.  What the hell is that?!  Schemin' people out of more money, that's what.

      Happy Turkey Day to everyone out there.  I am still stuffed, and I didn't really even eat that much.   I had fun in Charlotte, with my neice, nephews and sisters.  I hate that I hardly get to see them!  Didn't see David, I told him it was up to him to call me if he had time or wanted to see me, since he had the busy work schedule, and never heard a peep, as I figured it would be.  Too chicken, he tried to put it back on me, so he wouldn't be responsible for making the initiative, but didn't work.  I can see past the psychological games that he's playing..  he wants to make it seem like I'm calling wanting to spend time with him.  I'm not that stupid.  Honestly, I totally forgot about it, we were busy doing stuff all afternoon and night last night.   I bet I get an IM tomorrow saying "what happened, why didn't you call?!"    Anyways.  Tomorrow is Justin's birthday, I had a cute little card to send, but Robin never got me his address, and I didn't want to just ask him, cuz I wanted it to be a surprise.  Oh well, I'll just call him.  Haven't talked to him since last weekend.. what's up with that?!  Tomorrow Lauren & I are being tards and getting up at the ass crack of dawn to go shopping!  Wheee!  I'm excited.  I'm sure I"ll end up with hardly any Christmas shopping, it'll all be stuff for myself.  that's how it usually works out.   I'm hoping that bath & body works will have some good sales, so I can get my sister in law crap that she wants.   That's about it.. time to go do something else.  Harry Connick Jr has a Christmas special on at 10 that I'm patiently waiting for... he's hot!!  OOh, and tomorrow night is a Justin Timberlake special, "back home in Memphis" or something like that.  I wish I had known when he was taping, I would have driven to Memphis to see if I could have spotted him, lol.   Maybe I should do some homework.. I really have no desire to do any of it though.. I really don't get the point of coming back for one week of classes..  why not start a week earlier in August, and finish up before Thanksgiving so we don't have to come back for 10 days?!  What idot devised that plan?  Ugh.   Ok, off I go!!

      I am home.  Rock on.  I got my butt up at 3:10am this morning, and was in the car cruisin' by 4am.  I am awesome.  It's really fun to drive at that time of day.  It's not quite pitch black like near midnight... it's neat.  I'll have to do it again.  =)  I did, however, still meet with DAMN TRAFFIC!!  I was pretty close to Knoxville around 7:30, I guess it was, maybe it was 8:30 Knoxville time, I can't remember.  But, there were a few major wrecks reported on the radio stations, and one of them once again shut down 40!!!!  ACK.  But, it didn't take too long to detour off an exit, and once we got off we were moving..   BUT       there were no markers as to where we were supposed to go once we got on this highway.  So, I'm cruising along and all of a sudden the road splits, north or south!  No signs saying this hits 40, NOTHING.  And, to top if off, the cars that I got off 40 with, went both ways!  ACK.  So, I picked south, cuz it veered off to the right, which seemed to me to be the direction I came from.  I tried to find a map, but all I had was SE states, which was no help.  And, then this road I'm on is all twisty through "mountain" and park areas.   Holy crap.  I just happened to notice a bent sign saying I was going towards I-40.. it was a sign meant for people coming from the perpendicular direction to see.. but I just happened to glance up and notice it as I sped by.  Jeesh.  After that though, it was smooth sailing.  I was home by 12:30, which is 7.5 hours on the dot.  faboo.   My mom and I went to Panera bread for lunch... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.   Then we went to Verizon and she got her and my dad hooked up with Verizon so they can dump stupid Altell.  And, she got a kick ass flip phone!  Oh, that is so not fair.  I'm so jealous.  And I'm going to find a way to steal it and make it into my number.  ;-)  I've been having lots of fun playing with it, I WANT IT!!   AHHHHH!  Why are cool phones so expensive?  I have to wait 6 more months till I can upgrade.  Fart.   That's abot it, I'm stupid now from being up for 19 hours.  Holy crap, I've got to go to bed.  Oh my goodness.

      Dude.  How could I forget that ice skating is so much fun?  I totally thought I'd get out on the ice and bust my butt, but it took me less than half a trip around the rink to get into my groove.  It was so fun, I was like "I have to do this more often!"   It was so fun.  Justin busted 3 times, it was funny!  Robin dared me to skate up to him and grab his hand, so I did and we skated around a few laps.  She said he had the biggest grin on his face.  ;-)   And, I took it upon myself to "be bold" as someone put it, and while we were driving back from skating (at like 11pm), with 3 of us crammed in the back seat.. I was like "Do you mind if I borrow your shoulder as a pillow?" and laid my head on his shoulder for a while.   So, that's about it.  I came back here at about 1am.  We all crashed pretty quickly after exerting all that energy skating.  Robin's cousin Shandy came too, I've got a couple pictures to post, and she's in one of them.  What else?  It was freakin' 78* on Friday or Saturday, CRAZY!  But, it's only supposed to be 40 tomorrow, hot damn!  I put up some Christmas lights tonight, on my porch, it looks so festive; but would look more so if there was some snow on the bushes..  I'm going home Tuesday, going to get up at like 3am and head out, so I can miss crazy traffic, hopefully.  Let's think about this some more.. if I leave by 3:30, that'll put me in Knoxville around 8 eastern time, I wonder if that'll be a traffic jam?!  Hm..  we'll figure it out.  I just want to have as much time as possible Tuesday and not waste so much time driving.  Ugh.  I gotta figure out what to do with the darn cat too!  I am not about to listen to her howl for 7 hours!!  I'm going to stick her in the trunk, and pull down the back seat or something, so she can at least get some air.  I'm a horrible person, I know.   I feel like I"m already done for the semester.  I've done no work this weekend.  There is plenty I could/should have done.. but I didn't. Part of the problem was the online course's website wasn't working, so I COULDN'T do that work!!    I'll do it at work tomorrow.  I've got to get up early to take Onex to the vet, she's having some sort of back spasms or something.   Das ist alles fur heute!

      I am done, minus one exam and a take home assignment, for the semester!  I just did my last counseling session, and filled out paperwork to have my pay check mailed to me, so I'm thinking about going home on Tuesday instead of Friday.  I don't really want to sit around for 3 days now that I don't have to.. I'd rather get the heck outta here and be at home.    Of course, that could change in a second.. if something should happen with Justin.  But, even still. I can't be here for another weekend, cuz I have to be home to babysit, so there is really no point.  I called him last night, and haven't heard a thing back.. so we'll see if he calls tonight.  At this point, I'm still kind of like "whatever".   And what's the point in anything happening now anyway, cuz I'm going home for a month and won't see him?!  Who knows.  Maybe if I adopt this attitude, it'll make him do something.  I need some mistle toe and to scheme with Robin.. heheh.   Who knows, certainly not me.  That conversation with David made me kind of indifferent to it all, if in fact it is 100% true.. but I don't know that either, so I shouldn't make any rash decisions.  We'll see.  He's never not called me back when I've left a message.  So, I dont' know whether he didn't get it; got it and it was too late to call; or got it and just didn't want to call.  He didn't make any mention of calling me back when I talked to him for a few mins last Friday.. he just said he was in the middle of a game and should get back to it.  I dunno, I'm kinda perturbed at him, without knowing the whole story, I guess.  This is too much effort, I'm losing interest, maybe that's it.   Ok, time to head home.. been at work long enough today, considering I'm way over on my hours.

      Well, here I am.  I'm back.  I made it in just about exactly 7 hours.  I left sometime around 6:40, and got here right around 12:45/12:50.  FABOO!  How did I do that?  I seriously thought that I wasn't going nearly as fast as I normally do, since I was soooo sleepy.  At about 10am, with the sun beating down on me, I was struggling to stay awake.  I hate that. There were no major traffic snag ups.. a construction zone in the mountains that closed a lane, but didn't really slow us down too much.  Awesome.  I love it when that happens, and I can just cruise!!   So, I got back, had time to unpack and go to the gym before "class".  We ate pizza and chatted, how fun.  (but kind of a waste of time, but at least the professor paid for our pizza)  Tomorrow is my last day of actual classes.. I have my research, which we'll actually DO something, and then my night one we'll probably just meet for an hour or less and wrap up. Hot damn.  Then Wednesday class is another dinner, this time out at a restaurant.  That'll be fun.  I'm going to miss having class with all these people.  All but me and one of the girls graduating are taking a groups class in the spring, but I already took it.  =(  How sad.  I love class with all those people!  But, at least a few of them will be in my other classes.  One of them though, isn't going to have any of the second year or above people!  ZUT!  What a bummer.  Oh well, I'll still see them, I'm sure.    Uh, that's about it.  I put up my mini Christmas tree tonight, and put some lights on my Christmas tree plant.  I've got to put up my lights around the doors, and I'll be all decorated!  Not nearly as festive looking as it is at home, but it'll do, for only 2 weeks of being here.  I forgot to get a timer while I was at home, so my outside lights could come on while I'm gone.  Hm.   Not a heck of a lot else to say.. haven't heard a thing from Justin.  I called him Friday, cuz it was his birfday.. but that was it.  Don't know what his deal is.. tonight was/is Monday night footballl, and the Titans are playing, so we'll just assume he's consumed with that.   I think I've decided I need to revert back to a blog entry from a LONG time ago, with some song lyrics... "There may never be a sign- no flashing neon light telling you to make your move or when the time is right... So why not take a crazy chance?  Why not do a crazy dance?  If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot, so why not?"  And seriously consider what happens next.  I hear, from Robin, via David, so we don't know how true it is, that Justin is never "going to do more than sit 6 inches from me and stare at my  hand" so to speak, so if I want it, I'd better lay my claim now before someone else does.  Hm.  Why Robin told David this, I don't know; and why he decided he needed to share it with me, I don't know either.  Supposedly b/c I am one of his best friends, and he feels should look out for me more than her (Cuz she told him this and he wasn't supposed to tell me, apparantly)   Weirdness.  But, I mean, what the hell kind of way to have any kind of relationship, assuming you really want it, to just sit there like a bump on a log?  Yes, I suppose that could be said of me too, but I've made little subtle hints, more so than wanting to spend time with Justin.  Yes, I spose I should take it as a good sign that he calls, comes ALL the way up here, invites me to do stuff, etc.. but that's not concrete "YES, I like you, there is no chance I will spaz out if you move things along"  Cuz there's that little bitty % of doubt that's stopping me from getting out of this holding pattern.  tthhpppppptttt.   FRUSTRATION.  Then how weird would it be if things didn't work out, cuz that would make a mess of hanging out with Robin & everyone.  AHH.   I need a sign!  ok.. gotta get to bed, I'm brain dead.  I had to do a take home final, finish up my research paper (which still isn't 100% finalized, gotta do some more in the morning), and drove all day.. so my brain is fried.    Later.   OH!  My hair.. it worked pretty well.  I got rid of some of the crazy light blond streaks in the front.  It's more my natural dark blond/light brown color, with highlights still in it.  I put at least one pic on the webshots page.. I don't know if you can really tell or not.  No one said anything today at work or in class.. but my mom said she could tell a lot.   So, we'll see.  It's a semi permanent one, that washes out in 28 shampoos, so I might try one shade darker next time, if I have to do it again.

      I'm dying my hair as we speak.. to get rid of the roots that are showing from the highlights, and to make it a bit darker, I hope.  Let's hope it doesn't turn my hair purple or something.  LOL.  Gotta work on some homework type stuff.. dude, I've done NOTHING all break.  What good is that?  Gotta get the Christmas tree out too and put it together and up and decorated.  YAY!!  Stay tuned.. more later, and I will post some photos of my crazy hair, if it looks any different.

      Wonders will never cease.   First, let me say never screw with Karma, cuz it will come back and kick you in the ass.  I've learned this, and seen other people learn this, and tonight I got to hear about David learning this.  hahaha.    So, I had this brilliant idea to be a smart ass and call him at the radio station and try to request a song, but he never answered the phone.  I may have been calling the wrong number come to find out.. not sure.   But anyway, as soon as I got home, I hopped online to tell him he was a punk for not picking up so I could harass him and have him play me a song on the air.  And after a few mins he asks if I thought he sounded like he was having a horrible day, and I said "no, taht was one of the reasons I was giong to call, to tell you you sounded lots better than over Thanksgiving".  And he starts to tell me he's having a suck ass day, and then says "call me" and gives me the hotline number.  So, after I unloaded the rest of my car and played with the dogs, I did.   And, he wasn't weird, maybe cuz it is really isn't in person, but still.  It was like talking to a long lost friend after years or something.  We just chatted like normal.  It was really nice, and good to hear his voice, having a normal conversation like I would with any of my other friends.  It makes me think that when we do see each other, we'll be totally cool.  And, on that note, he was talking about doing this and doing that, wanted to know when I was going to have free time to come see him.  I had to be like "woah, I just got out of the car, let me get my bearings straight here".   He's totally (for real) excited to see me, and he said again he really misses having me around.   It was a really nice conversation.  I'm looking forward to seeing him and hanging out with a real friend now.    So yes, I'm home now.  7 hours exactly.  Go me.  I rock.  I kicked my exams butt this afternoon, and if I didn't get an A, I only missed by a few points!!  I spazzed on one question, but I think I made up enough stuff that I can get partial credit.  I got there early, and a bunch of other people had the same idea, so we all studied together.  Rock on.  That's the best way.   Ok, I'm so wound up.  I've been still for 7 hours, that's way too long.  I think I shall go run around the block with Melody, who is also a nutcase right now.

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  PIECE OF SHIT BLOGGER JUST LOST MY LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG POST.  What the hell is up with that.  fer de fer de fer.     I hate that, now I can't remember what the hell I had written!  DAMMIT!  Uhm.  Don't know, my mind has drawn a blank.  I packed a TON and a half of clothes today.  Pretty much everything in my closet, well, I shouldn't say that, everything that I wear on a regular basis.  Cuz I have no idea what I'll want to wear, and it's not like I can come back and get it.  What a pain.   I typed up my "final" for my research class, studied, finished up a quilt, a very productive day!!  If I do say so myself.   Ah!  I'm so excited to be going home, you have no idea!!  I'm going to hang out with my 3 favorite girlies on Thursday, Amy (from NY) and I are going to go ice skating and shopping this weekend and catch up.  I haven't spent quality time with her in YEARS, this is so surreal that she's in NC and I'm not!  Then, next weekend, Lauren, Becca & I are going to see Barenaked Ladies in Raleigh, my mom & I are going shopping with some friends from NY, and then Sunday, Lauren & I are going BACK to Raleigh to pick up Alice the bunny from the airport, coming back from CA!  I havne't seen her in 6 months, holy crap!  We're gonna be spazzes!  She comes in really late at night, so we'll probably going to stop somewhere on the way back for birthday drinks and dessert, since it'll turn over to my birfday on our way home.  YAY!!  My mom got the Christmas tree up, so we're gonna decorate that Thursday too, probably.  Yay.    Random quote for you:  Im pretty excited about you coming home... I miss your friendship.  I hope we get to meet up and hang out.   Brought to you courtesy of David!!  What the heck is that?  Maybe he's gotten over himself now.  Every time we chat, he says something about visiting him while I"m home, making sure I have his number, asking what I'm going to be doing all that time, etc.   I sure hope he can be normal, and act like a friend this time.  Because if it's another meeting like when I saw him back in October, I'm seriously going to think twice about continuting a friendship.  I know it'll take time in person, but still...  As for the other boy, STILL NOT A PEEP!  What the hell is up with that?  Nothing since I left a message Wednesday.  I've been too busy with stuff to remember to call again at a normal time (IE not while he's at work or late at night), so I don't know if he got my message or what.  But, even if he didn't, you'd think he'd call!?   Hello.  Whatever.  I'm seriously not too worried about it, if he decides to call me, or I call him and we talk and something is still there, then it'll still be there when I get back from break.  Amy is gonna find me a cute law student while I'm home.  ;-)  Uhm, I think I captured the jyst of what I had originally typed up..   only 2 weeks till my birfday!  (Man, I'm getting old!!!)  It's going to be even stranger this year, even less people home for Christmas.  Oh well.  We'll make it up in PA for New Years.  Katheirne is going to have a new year's eve eve party, and then we're going out in Baltimore on New Year's Eve.  Rock on, that'll be a blast, assuming no one wusses out, like they did when we were supposed to go out here.  OH!  Alice is coming too, and is on the same flight back to NC as me, so I'll get to fly with someone!  How fun is that?!  I wish we had a layover, so we could wander around a weird airport together!!  Ok, that's it.  Gotta hit the books.  Wish me luck tomorrow.  And, if you've got nothing else to do tomorrow (Tuesday) after 4pm, call me and entertain me on my drive.  I've got lots of minutes on my cell phone to use up before they turn over on the 10th!!

      Not a heck of a lot to report.  Just bummin' around until my exam on Tuesday.  Oooh baby.  =0)   I finished my study guide and my take home assignments.  Now I just have to keep reviewing until it's all in my head, pack up all the hundreds of pounds of clothes that I'm taking home with me, and I'm ready to go!  It's going to be a long 2 days.  Perhaps tomorrow I'll do some baking and take snacks into work.   Who knows.  I guess I'd better see what next semester is going to start off with too.. might be a good idea. ;-)   I've been looking on the internet to see what kind of counseling agencies I can find in Charlotte..  just to see what's around.  Katherine might move to Charlotte for a new Apple store opening there, so I thought I'd look into what's around Charlotte for me, and then we could live together or close together again.  That would rock.  We could go out and hang out all the time, it'd be perfect.   I really think I'll end up somewhere back in NC.  That's what I'm going to try to do over break, is find contacts for internships.  Rock on. Make sure those of you reading this remind me to do that!!

      Man, I had "forgotten" how fun BNL (Barenaked Ladies) are in concert.  Even when you're crammed like cattle in a sea of 1000+ people.  =)  More later, I just had to put that out there.. now I'm off to see Hailey K Jacob & family!

      Man, I don't know if it was the ice skating, or just getting up so early yesterday & today, or what!?  But I have been so tired and so blah today!  My legs are sore, I know from ice skating, and I guess from not going to the gym for 2 days.  Ow.  Then, I didn't get to go today, cuz I was a lazy butt and slept all afternoon & then I made pasketti for dinner and had to randomly babysit for a few hours, so I ran around the neighborhood, so I'm gonna feel that tomorrow too!  Ow.  Uhm, what else?!  OH!  My car got fixed today, at the VW dealership here.  Took it in at about 9am, and they called maybe an hour later to tell us that some valve or pipe was making the A/C not work.. uhm, why could they tell me that in under 2 hours, but the people at the VW place in Clarksville couldn't tell me that after having my car in there how many times?!  URGH!!  I haven't tested it really yet, it blew cold air.. so who knows.  They have a warranty on their work, so if it doesn't work when it gets hot again, I can take it back.  Hot damn.  The dude was really nice.. he recognized Austin Peay; he'd played them in baseball with whatever school he went to, and was asking me all about that.  Cute.  They even vaccuumed the inside of the car and washed the outside of it, snazzy place!!  I have to be to the freakin' eye doctor at 8am tomorow, at Baptist.  HOLY CRAP that's early!! I hate getting up that early.  UGH!!  But, hopefully, I'll get to bed early tonight.  I want to stop at AC Moore or Michaels when I'm done, cuz I have an urge to be crafty.  I want to get some canvas to paint on, like they do on Trading Spaces, when each member of the family makes their own art.  Then I can hang it on my walls and do some "real" decorating. And, I want everyone to contribute to one, sort of like Katherine's sheet that we all doodle on.. I don't know how I'm going to get everyone's contribution.. but we'll see.  I was also thinking of doing some variations on my comforter theme (dark navy with gold/yellow moons and stars) and making some fun art to go with that.     I also have decided I'm going to buy myself a new couch when I get back in January.  The one I have is getting so old and squeaky & "deflated".  And I'm sick of the damn slip cover not fitting right!!  So, that will be my big purchase with my leftover loan money.  I'm hoping I can find a semi nice one for not too much.  I want a big stuffed one, like our new one downstairs.  I keep trying to convince my mom that she needs a new set, so I can take hers.  No such luck.   Well, that's about it for now.  I'm going to head to bed, I do believe.

      Wow, I've been slack!  There's just not much exciting to report on a daily basis.   Today I spent the day in Charlotte, with David.  It was fun.  We went to lunch, went ice skating, and hung out at his house.  It was good, and not weird at all.  No directly "inuendos" of "I want you back-ness", like Erica or KM thought might happen.  He has made a few non-challant comments over IM before, but nothing in person.  I had my "buzz of, not an ice cubes chance in hell" responses ready though, just in case.  I think he might finally realize he needs to take some time for himself.  The ex, Caren, has pretty much completely written him out of her life and won't talk to him.  He's not sure if this will continue over the break or not (she's still at ASU), but he's pretty much decided tough shit for her, and whatever is meant to be, will be.  (this is where a few of those comments came in, he's said something like whether it's you or her that I'm meant to be with... or someone else completely).  But, it was really nice to see him and be normal with him.  I even got the pleasure of seeing his square parents.  OH BOY!  I was kinda worried about that, and when we got back from ice skating, they were both there.. and acted surprised to see me (kind of like, oh what's going on here...) but were very nice and wanted to know what I was doing, how my parents were, etc.  And, they're very easy to read, in that you can tell if they're being fake, and they appeared to really want to know how I was and what was going on, and seemed genuine when they said that they were glad to see me, and to be sure to keep them posted on what I'm doing.  His dad was asking me about Austin Peay basketball for a while, so it was fun.   It's like reuniting with a long lost friend!  Yay, I'm glad we've finally gotten to this place.  In other news... um... it iced here Saturday night, and everything shut down on Sunday.  I'm taking my car to the VW place here in W-S tomorrow to see if they're smart enough to fix the a/c... Wednesday I have to be up at the ass crack of dawn to go to the freakin' eye doctor, and have a lovely visual field test one.  I HATE THEM!  You have to stare at dots in this big machine for about an hour, and not move your gaze from the center point, and click a button each time you see one flashing out in space.  It drives me batty!!!  Then, this weekend is BNL in Raleigh and picking up Alice the bunny!!!  YAYAY!  And, I think we're going to see Hailey K Jacob in Greensboro too.  Happy day.   Not sure what else is in store.  I'm very tired now.  Ice skating wore me out!  That, and I could not go to sleep until about 2am last night, then Mel woke me up at about 7:30 to go outside, so I got up and went to the gym them, and then left for Charlotte by 9:30.  Crazy buttsex!  Enough for now, I'm about brain dead!

      Well, It's the day after Christmas, and my Mom & I braved the crowds of psychos and went to the mall!!  It really wasn't that bad in the mall, but the parking lot was a mess! Stupid drivers, don't let anyone out, it's ridiculous!! But, I accomplished my goal, I got 2 caledars at the calendar store, for 50% off.  YAY.  The one I was after was the presidential mis-speak one, with quotes from GW Bush for each day, where he has mis-spoken like he's so famous for.  I got it for my dad, and when I got that, there were 2 variations, but they didn't have the second one when I went today.  Oh well.  It'll still be hilarious!!  I might have to post each quote on here or something, lol.   Didn't really do much shopping at the mall today; mom returned some stuff at JCPenney, and I found 2 cute shirts there, but that's about it.  We went to Target, I was looking for Dawson's Creek season 2, which I saw there last week but was no where to be found today!!! ARGH!  I shall have to try the other target later tonight or another day.   What else did Santa bring me... a bread machine (YUM!!), a stand up mixer, Friends season 3, dvds (Legally Blonde 2, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, and Bruce Almighty), 2 John Mayer CDs, lots of socks, a massage gift certificate, some really snazzy picture frames, Murphy in the Morning "best of" cd (yay!), Panera bread gift card, a pooh calendar and some mula.  I'm most excited about the bread machine and the massage.  I'm going to have it right before I go back to school.. that should keep me relaxed for oh, maybe a week.  lol.   We went to my brother's house for Christmas dinner, surprise surprise.  They NEVER invite us over there.  And, Kim actually cooked; usually when we go over we have pizza.  We had a nummy pork tenderloin. mmmm.  That is something perhaps I could buy and cook for myself... hm.  ~*note to self*~  That's about it.  Tomorrow we're all gathering at Laurens, for a parent/kid party thing.  Cute.  And, tonight we are posed to do something too.  Which reminds me, I need to go call Becca and Zack and see if they're up for something.  Maybe they'll brave Wal mart with me, and I can find Dawson's Creek there!  damn Target.   OH!  Another piece of randomness... I got this IM on my birthday frmo some screen name I didn't recognize.. saying "Hey, this is Bart, happy birthday".  I was like, ok, whatever.  Then, I saw that that my mom had this person on her buddy list.  Well, it turns out it's a guy that I grew up with in NY, whos mom & my mom were best buddies when we were toddlers and stuff.   When I told my mom this she said "Oh yea, I was going to tell you that Carol (the mom) said Bart wanted your IM name".  Bizarre.  I don't think I really even talked to any of the kids even before we moved, maybe I did.  I can't remember if we saw them while we were visiting this summer, or not.  I know we went to their house, and mom's friend Carol wasn't there, but I can't remember if any of the "kids" were around.  So, anyway, we chatted for a while.  I just thought it was the most bizarre thing!!  Like, hello past life!  =)  Ok, I'm off!

      Ok, now it's calm, and I can think clearly about all that I need to update.  First.. BNL.  The concert was in Raleigh, at the Longbranch "Entertainment Complex" as Ticketmaster put it.  It was a country bar/club.  HAH.  Pretty big, but still, no seating, just standing around like cattle.  Then, Ticketmaster told me the show was at 8.. so we got there at about 7:15 and the line was already around the building.  Crazy.  So, come to find out, the doors opened at 8, show was at 10!  Ahh.  So, we stood around for 2 hours, so we wouldn't lose our god viewing spot.  had a few drinks, danced a tad.  And, me being the intelligent person that I am.. I wore my new HUGELY tall boots, and my feet were killing me all night.  I took them off a few times, but then I couldn't see.  By the end of the night, I was hobbling around.  Never again.  The show was good, of course.  Could BNL not be good?  I don't think so.  We had fun shopping before hand too.. I finally found another Mistletoe Yankee candle!!  And I got 2 cute Disney Store shirts.. one with Timone & Pumba saying "Hakuna Matata" and a Stitch one (from Lilo and Stitch).  Too cute.   I didn't get home from dropping Lauren & Becca off until about 2:30, and then I was awake till about 4, cuz my feet and legs hurt from standing in those damn shoes!!  The price we pay for fashion!!  AHH.  Saturday I got my tired butt out of bed at 9 to go to the gym so we could leave to go to Greensboro to see Hailey K Jacob at 11.  Man, I was a walking zombie all day.  But, we had fun chillin' with the Jacob family for a couple hours.  Hailey is so big!!  I can't believe it.   Sunday was back to Raleigh to pick up Alice the bunny.  We stopped in Gibsonville/Elon to have dinner with Tucker & Don, which was too fun.  We ate at this little italian place, and stuffed our faces.   It's going to be a miracle if I can make it through this break without gaining any weight, with all the crap I've been eating!! My mom seriously needs to quit baking!  ANYWAY.  So then Tucker, Lauren & I drove the rest of the way to  Raleigh, got there jsut as Alice was coming to baggage claim, got her bags and were on our way.  We stopped at Applebees so Alice could get some food, and we had nummy blue drinks.  =)  Then we hung out at Tuckers looking at wedding photos for about an hour.  Fun times.  David called me on teh way home from Tucker's, at about 12:05 to be the first to wish me happy birthday on my actual birthday.  Cute.  He's trying very hard, I must say, to be a good friend.  He made a comment about that, saying he's lucky to have me, since he doesn't have a lot of other friends that he's kept up with.  I honestly think that's all it is, I do not think there are any ulterior motives.  Then later, once I got home, I ended up talking to him online till almost 4am.  I swear, he's going to help me develop my counseling skills more than practicum classes!!  I should charge him!  It's always something.   But, I've been whipping out my stuff I've learned in class and asking him all these thought provoking questions, it's great.  ;-)  Sucks for him to be having all these issues, but it's great for me.  hahah.    Monday, my actual birthday, was very quiet.  I slept till about noon, and when I got up no one was home!!  My mom & gma had gone out shopping, and dad was of course at work.  So, I putzed around and then went to the gym for a nice workout.  My sister Kathy brought me over a present mid afternoon (a cute litle pewter alarm clock that ticks!) and then my mom & I went to Millicans to take them their presents (the babysitting peoples).  I got a $30 American Eagle gift card AND a bunch of bath & Body works stuff.. rock on!!  I was impressed. Then, we went out to dinner, at AppleBees again.   Fun times.  Lauren & Alice came over around 8:30 to decorate cake, how sad.  It was only the 3 of us.  Zack was around, but he was too tired from working overtime to come.  =(  We called KM while we were doing the cake and she sang to me too, so that was cool.  It's so sad that we're so spread out.  BUT, have no fear, we'll all be in Baltimore/York soon enough.  Maybe we can make another cake and do it there!  ;-)  Of course, Amy still won't be there, and her singing is the best part.  OH!  Presents.  I got Season1 of ER dvd set, Finding Nemo, Old Navy pants, and an assortment of Ralph Lauren Blue stuff (perfume, lotion and shower gel).  Faboo!!  That's a load of loot!  I've watched about 4  ERs already. That's more draining than going through a season of Friends, lol.  :o)  Then, as I said before, today was Christmas with the Charlotte and Kernersville families.  It was CRAZY.  The kids tore into the presents and were trying to open ones that weren't theirs.  I finally had to be the present police.  Oh my goodness.  I must be old, all the loudness and crazyness was getting to me.  But, it was cool to have little kids around, with all their excitement.  Aww. I got a really cool set of "t-shirt" jersey sheets (they've got pink and orange flowers on them), a couple of CD's (Michelle Branch & Josh Kelley), a super powered dirt devil little mini vaccuum, and Trivial Pursuit 20th Century.  I can't wait to play it!!  One more thing to take to Baltimore.  I'm taking my huge monster suitcase.. for 3 days, man, I tell ya.    I do believe that is all for now.. I'm sure I've left out something important, but it'll get posted eventually.  OH.  I called Justin back tonight.. nothing spectacular happened.  We talked for about 40 mins, as usual.  So, who knows.  I certainly don't, and I don't really care to worry about it.  Maybe that'll make things "easier" between us, so whatever is meant to happen will, ya know?  Kinda like if you decide you don't like someone, they like you more?!  I dunno.   Ok, to bed.  I'm exhausted.

      Holy crap!  Guess who called me last night?!   Justin.  Oh my god.  I didn't talk to him, he'd left me a voice mail by the time I got to my phone, and Lauren and Alice were on their way over anyway for birthday stuff... but oh my god.   He left a message, saying he just wanted to check in and see what was up, and that he was sorry for not calling, work got crazy, he had to do a lot of traveling, and if I'm mad at him and don't want to talk to him again, that's cool too, he just wanted to wish me a Merry Christmas/happy New Year, etc.  Weird.  As soon as I "give up" or move on or whatever, decide I don't want to get into any relationship, he calls.  Not that I know what he wanted in calling me, but still.  I might call him back later tonight, after all the craziness subsides.  My neices & nephews & siblings  from Charlotte & Kernersville have been here all day for Christmas.  Wow.  Crazyness!!!!  So, last night Lauren, Alice & I were the only ones to decorate cake.  How sad. =(  But, KM was with us on the phone.   It was a very uneventful day.  I slept in late, and did nothing much all day.  It didn't even feel like a birthday.  It's not nearly as much fun when you're older!    So, I'm not thinking clearly with all the mass confusion aronud me, so I shall update more later.   I just had to share that out of the blue news!!

      I'm sick, and it's Alice's fault.  Well, maybe only partly.  Perhaps some it has to do with lack of sleep, but it's more fun to blame someone else.     So, yes.  My fun trip.  Alice & I went to the hotel Monday night, got there about 9.  Lauren came right around midnight, later than expected, but we knew that would happen.  So, needless to say, we didn't get much sleep.  Left, arrived on time, as I've said before.. and got back to KM's and started cleaning.  Erica got there about 10:30, I guess it was; Lauren & Alice a little later.  We cleaned and then went to Panera for lunch, mmmm.  And did our shopping at Wal Mart and the alcohol store.  Num.  Then we opened our Christmas presents (I got a fun game, also mentioned in an earlier post, and a scarf and hat set)  Then it was rest time for me.  I sacked out on the couch for only about an hour, but it seemed more than that.    Then, got changed to look spiffy for the par-te, which ended up only being a few "outsiders".  A handful of people that KM works with cancelled.  Bummer.  Avi decided to grace us with his presence close to 10, I guess it was.  I lost all track of time that night.  We ended up with lots of fun food stuff.. bean dip, homemade peppermint patties, rice crispy treats, crackers, etc.  It was snazzy.  Oh, and we made Jello "shooters" in jello jiggler shapes, how fun!!  Man, what a kick they had! We played some roudy games of set, danced the "cha cha" and other various party type dances, and drank ourselves silly.  Thom, Jen & Will, also from the apple store were the only other 3 work people that came.  Avi brought his friend.  It was neat.  We all mingled and stuff.   We started a massage chain late in the night, and I ended up getting a  FABULOUS 45 minute massage from Will, who has been deemed my "baltimore boyfriend" and who Katherine was trying to hook up with me.  We flirted, he was very touchy, it was fun.  We forgot to make use of the mistle toe though, I wanted to put it over KM's head so Avi had to kiss her.  oh well.  Had I been thinking a little more clearly..  Lauren, Erica, and Alice all went to bed early, and Thom & Jen and Avi's friend all left by like 2 or 3.  Will, Avi, KM and I played Uno for a good hour, I guess it was, and then made a 4am run for frozen pizza.  Oh my goodness.  Then when we got back, Lauren and made her bed in the living room, so we had to sit in silence for an hour while Will ate and cooked his pizza.  Lordy.  It was a little after 5 that I finally crashed, I think.  It was so awesome though.  I want to do it again next month.    Needless to say, however, we were DEAD the next day.  Lauren & Erica were up around 10am I guess it was, getting ready to leave.. I fell back asleep and when I woke up they were gone!  Zut!  How sad.  I didn't get to say good bye, and who knows when I'll see them again.  :-/  Oh well.  That day we lounged till about 3, I guess it was, then I took Ilse for a run and then we went to Old Navy and rummaged thru the sale messes.  I got some fabulous stuff, all of it on sale.  I love that store.  Then had Mexican and came home and settled on the couch.  Thom came over for a bit, and we thought Will was going to come up, but he stood us up!  :-P  Punk.  We played some random card game and watched the ball drop, and then we dropped.  Exciting huh?  Didn't get to go to the Inner Harbor cuz Alice randomly decided she was leaving on Thurs instead of with me on Friday.. so we had to make a trip down Thursday, so no sense making another trip.  Oh well.  We talked about going out in York, but we were all too tired to move ourselves.   New years eve eve was enough fun.  LOL.   Thurs we took Alice to BWI, and then stopped in at the store to say hello.  We also went out and about in Baltimore and did something "scandalous".  :-O  If you want to know what, ask me.  It can't be public knowledge yet.   And, if you read my other post, you know what I did all day Friday.  Thanks to KM's bitch of a boss.  My flight left about 20 mins late from BWI, but we got in only 5 mins late, cuz it was only a 40 min flight, not an hour like they had it scheduled.  So, no biggie.  I got my luggage fairly quickly and called for my shuttle and was to the hotel and my car by 11:15 I think it was. Not too bad.  I was sooooooooooo tired driving home.  Man.  I came home and zonked out.  And then slept most of the day on and off today. I got up and took the dogs for a walk with mom, and then went back to sleep on the couch.  I feel ucky.   So, that is my fabulous trip!! =)  I miss all you fabulous people so much!! I wish we could all live in the same city again so we could do this more often.  I want to be rich so I can fly to visit someone every other weekend!    Ok, I'm going to bed now, in hopes that the more sleep I get, the better I will feel.

      There is only so much to do in a mall, before you are bored out of your mind.  I'm waaaaay past that point right now.  I'm at Katherine's mall in Baltimore, while she's working.  Her manager pitched a fit and wouldn't let me sit in back of the store with her ibook watching Dawson's Creek.  So, I've wandered around the mall several times, sat at the food court and read and watched people, and spent time playing on the puters in the Apple Store.  We've been here since 9am.. it's 4:30 now.. I've had it.  I think I'm just going to loiter here for the rest of the time.  I did watch one episode of DC this am, but the battery was wearing out, so I wasn't sure how much more I could watch.  I bought a Judy Blume book, actually 2 books in one, that I've been reading diligently.  Avi is here now, and we're pestering KM.  Fun times.  1.5 more hours.  Rah.  Then I'll have to sit at the airport for ever.  I don't need to be there till 7:45, so we have almost 2 hours to kill after KM gets done with work.. hmm...  That's about it.  I can't remember when I posted last, whether or not I told about the par-te or New Years eve or not.  I'll do it when I get home.  Rah.

      Hurray!  it's now 2004.  OOh, baby, feel the excitement.  =)  Not a lot going on here in York.  We had the New Years Eve eve party last night, and some of us were up and out till about 5am!  Dude, I was awake for over 24 hours, that's way crazy.  It was fun though.  We played Uno and quasi played a new game Lauren got me, Expose Yourself it's called.  Its kinda like a book of questions game.  Fun times.   Uhm, flight was ok, a little bumpy.  Took off and landed on time; but we got me to the airport at 4:30ish, and they didn't open the ticket counter till almost 5:30.  What the hell?  There were 6am Southwest flights!!!  Jeesh.  BUt the curb side check in opened a little after 5.  Lordy.  Had to wait about 20 mins for KM to get there, same as last time.  :-P  We shopped and prepared for the party, including doing our own version of "Queer Eye for the Stratight Guy" on KM's apartment.  We cleaned for hours, rearranged, "decorated", cooked, etc.  It was like a totally different place, it was amazing!!  I bet it doesn't stay that way for long though. ;-)  I did get to take a little nappy nap before everyone came around 8pm.  We got to meet Avi... I'm not impressed at all; he gets a big fat "X" eeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh (family fued strike noise).  But, it's not my decision, and even though everyone there said the same thing, I imagine Katherine will still do as she pleases.  We never seem to take the advice of our friends, even though most of the time it turns out to be correct.  (IE if everyone had tole me what an ass they thought David was, I probably wouldn't have 100% listened to them, but perhaps if I had I could have saved myself a lot of trouble!!)  Uhm, I'm not really in a concentrating mood to give updates of the past few days... I'll have to do it once I'm home, or maybe Friday when I'm stuck at work with KM all day.  There's an idea.

      What is the deal?  I think some higher power does not want me to go back to TN yet.  It's posed to sleet/ice/snow and overall wintry SHIT tomorrow, just because I'm supposed to drive back to TN.  Ugh.  Maybe it won't be as crappy as the weather people are making it out to be...  but even still, I'll really have no way of knowing till I get up there in the mountains.  I don't really want to mess with that if it's the least bit slick.  That would be no good.  Perhaps I should just wait till Sat when there is no freakin' precipitation scheduled at all.  And, that way I can watch Ed tomorrow night too.  What a freakin' pain, I finally get myself mentally ready to leave, and this happens.  For once, I'm pissed off at snow!!  And, all I've got to say about it is, there damn well better be as many Thursday/Friday snow days this year as there were last year, so I can miss out on lots of class!!  The people who were in this lifespan class, which was also on Thursday evenings last spring, missed like 4 or 5 classes, cuz all the snow happened on Wednesday nights/Thursdays.  So, it's only fair it happens that way this year too!!  Then Carmen and I can play in the snow all day!  Rah!

      I want to go back to TN, but at the same time I don't.  I'm getting antsy I guess because I know it's almost time; I miss my apt, I want to get things all settled and rearranged, and go out looking for a new couch.  I don't want to start back to work and school and not have my mom around all the time.  Going back means I have to seriously start thinking about what's going to happen in May, and seriously looking for internships and shit.  Ugh.  Can't it all just fall into my lap? I don't want to grow up and be in the real world!!!  hm.... what else what else?  I've been in a very blah mood lately.  I imagine cuz I'm sick & still catching up on sleep from visiting Katherine.    Oh, I know.  I got a massage today.. holy moly, I'm still feeling a little like a pile of mush.  I wish they didn't have to end so soon.  I could have laid there for another 3 hours.  I still have a knot in my shoulder area though, I don't know what I did to it.  I guess going back to the gym after not working out the whole time I was in York.  Ow.   I need a boy.  Not a relationship, just a fun boy to have a "thing" with.  Nothing deep and meaningful, cuz I don't think I really need that right now.  I don't want anything interfering with my decision of where to end up when I'm done with school.  I've let than influence me before, and I don't care to do it again.  But, I just miss having someone to snuggle with and kiss & hug.  Ya know?!  Someone just needs to appear out of thin air.  "Poof- here's your boy with no stirings attached!"  :-P  Wouldn't that be nice.  As Katherine puts it "I want to fall in love", to remember that feeling.  I do want that, especially in light of so many people recently getting engaged or planning weddings, but I don't think I can yet allow myself to do that again.  I think I need to have something silly and short term first.   Cuz everyonce in a while, it still hurts.  Not wanting David back, but missing that amazing feeling of how things were a long time ago.  And how everything seemed perfect because you had someone that was so enamored with you.  I have no romantic feelings left towards him, but I'm wondering if talking to him and seeing him is making me think like this, or it's just something that will always pop up randomly.  Or maybe it's the fact that he's falling right back in with his girlfriend from HS, that he has decided is the best thing since sliced bread and that he was the dumbest person ever to let her go.  I guess perhaps that's pissing me off, because he treats me like shit and then turns around and gets exactly what he wants.  It's not quite fair, is it?  It seems like I should be the one getting exactly what I want, since he was the ass.   But then, I realize that I wanted things to end too, it's just easier to blame him beacuse he forced the issue.  I think maybe thinking about going back to TN has got me thinking all this too; remembering this time last year- going to David's new house, spending a few days secluded there before classes started.  I imagine each "milestone" until next summer will remind me of things and re-open some of the hurt.  blargh.  And, speaking of boys.  Not another peep from Justin.  I spose I could email him or something, but I just don't care about it that much while I'm home.  I don't think I will that much once I'm back in TN either, until I happen to hang out with him & Mike & Robin.  And even then, I'm just going to act aloof, let him come to me if that's what he wants.   And, on that note, I have to leave to go pick up Alice to go romp around the mall and other fun places in W-S.

      heheheh.  I just found a site to order those oval "OBX" type stickers, and got myself a "NH" one and a "BNL" one.  Fabulous.  I'm so excited!  I've wanted a NH (really New Hampshire, but I choose to beleive it's for Nicole Heller) for the longest time!!  It only took me an hour of searching on the internet to find a place that sold all the states, or even better, a site where you can make your own!!  So, Lauren can now make up some random letters to piss off other people the way she gets pissed off when she sees them.  LOL.    here are the sites:   urlLink make your own   urlLink State, etc decals

      People need to stop dying.  No one else that I remotely know is allowed to die any time soon, OK?  In the last 3 weeks, 4 people that I "know" (by association or whatever) have died.  What is the deal?   I'm going to NY tomorrow, for a funeral of a reallllly close family friend.  Bill Landschoot.  His wife was my dad's secretary for as long as he was superintendent at Clifton.  I remember spending time with them in my earliest memories.  They were sorta like my second set of god-parents or something. And when we moved to NC, we just happened to move up the street from their son & family, and I've taken care of their kids ever since then.   It's so very sad.   It makes me worry about something happening to my parents, and I'm over here in TN too far away from them.  Just makes me want to finish up and move back as soon as I can so I can spend as much time as possible with my family and friends.  This is no good.    Anyway, for a last minute flight, I got a pretty good deal, only $207 bucks, to fly out Saturday.  It was almost $700 to fly out on Sunday, what the heck?  The funeral is on Monday and I'm coming back on Tuesday.  What a sucky way to get a random trip to NY. =(

      I forgot to mention in my gargantuan post of ramblings, that I found 2 counselor type jobs listed through Austin Peay, and I've faxed my info in, so send happy thoughts my way that I'll hear something and perhaps have a job/intership kinda dealio starting.  I need to get crackin'.  If I don't start something this semseter, I've decided I'm going to do it at home.   I don't want to stay here just to do that, and have to depend on crappy ass pay to live.  ALtho, I spose I could still get student loans, since I'd be enrolled.. but hmm.  No GA position to get instate tuition.  I should have changed my address!    But, I think I have decided that I want to go back to NC.  I'll miss people here, APSU people and Robin & Mike, and just the area in general. When I think about leaving, it makes me sad cuz it's just so cute and nice here... but I can come visit.  It's not that far.  I need to be near my parents and everyone else.   I don't want to have to rely on sucky work "vacations" to spend time visiting people.  I want to be able to go have lunch with my mom; or see my neices and nephews more than twice a year; and babysit my girlies in my free time and watch them grow up and be apart of their lives.  It's too hard to cram it all in on short visits home.  I mean, how long was I home for Christmas?  ANd I still didn't get to see everyone I wanted to?!  IT's just insane.  So, as I see it, let the countdown begin.. hopefully in 6 months, I'll be living in NC again.   That makes me happy.

      So, I don't know what my deal is lately.. there have been several times recently that all of a sudden, out of the blue, a rush of saddness comes over me, and I feel like it's 6 months ago all over again, and I just want to cry and ask "why?! what happened?!"  I am guessing this is normal, given the major event that has taken place: David getting back together with whats-her-face.   But, I sometimes wonder if he's trying to rub it in my face with his away messages and AIM profiles and stuff.  And, it seems like ever since all this fell into place, he talks to me less.  I mean, he gripes/whines whatever to me while all this crap is going on before they get together, and then doesn't even tell me when they officially do.  !?  And I don't know if that's me being a jealous friend only, at getting the shaft cuz he's so giddy in love, or something else.  As I continue to examine all this, I still have no romantic feelings towards him, and I certainly don't want to get back together, that's the LAST thing I want.  But, I read the silly, childish away messages that they leave each other, and I'm like "Hey, he never did that when we were dating, did he?  He never went out of his way to come spend a day with me?  He wasn't this sentimental and romantic for us?  Should that have been a sign, is that a sign?"  I guess this is the shocker that happens with all ended/failed relationships; when you first find out that the ex is happily in love with someone else.   But, it just makes me wonder what he thinks about when he thinks of the 2 years we were together, if he thinks everything in the world is perfect now that he's got her back.  Did he really have those feelings for me at all, or has he just forgotten them now?  And, what also bugs me is that he's said on many occasions "You 2 are so much alike it's uncanny". Well, what's she got that's so much better that you had to torture yourself for 4 months trying to get her back?!  And, if you supposedly did the same thing for me 2+ years ago, why did all that change?!  I don't know what's going on.... I KNOW there is no way I could ever want to be with him again; his maturity level, his place in life/growing up, his job-  he's never happy, never will be happy.  He's always going to be complaining about work, but never will do anything about it- and that's what soured me before, always hearing about that.  whine whine whine.  And, he tells me that she matured so much from the time he "couldn't stand her!", but I see their silly messages and think "oh, that's so mature, that's an adult relationship, sure"  But at the same time, I'm like "well shit, what did I do that was so awful that he "fell out of love with me".  Ugh. Now as I'm writing this I see how silly it is, but it's just random emotional outbursts of saddness.  I seriously wonder if I should cease all contact for a while, if I hope to remain friends.  But then again, would he even care.  He's got her now, why does he even need me as a friend.  Until they have problems and he comes running for advice.  Altho, I will give him this much.  yesterday I had up my :-/ face away message, cuz I was feeling blah and poopey, and he IMed me a whole bunch wanting to know what was wrong, what was going on, that is so not a Nicole face.  Then, when I didn't answer him, he called.  So, I guess he does care as a friend, but I don't know how much of a friend I can be if he's always talking about her, or blowing me off to spend time with her, or if I have to see them together.  Ugh, it's a mess, and I don't know if I even made sense with all of this.  It just keeps creeping into my thoughts and I don't really know why.  I am happy where I am right now, and while I miss certain parts of a relationship, I don't really want one right now.  Blargh.  All this, and I miss home already.  I think that's my answer... I need to move back closer to home.  I wish katherine were moving to Charlotte, that was going to be so cool.  Charlotte by myself would be fun too.. but not nearly as much.    ANyway, I'm going to post this and read thru it and see how totally confusing and rambly it is.  Then I'm going to go to the gym and work out some of this frustration and icky-ness.

      So, tonight we had a "Peay-A-Thon" welcome back bash in the gym.. basketball, board games, food, dancing, etc.  I got there about 5:30 cuz class got out early, and Lynne, my boss was already there, waiting on some of the frat boys that were helping with set up.  So, we took some stuff in, and then a bit later they got there with their trucks full of drinks and the rest of the food.  So, we're all unloading stuff for a while, and then setting up tables, food, etc and one of the guys who'd kinda indirectly talked to me before comes up to me and says "Hey, since we haven't been introduced yet, I'm Jason"  and I tell him my name and Lynne was like, "Oh sorry, guys, this is Nicole my GA, if I'm not here, she's in charge"  So, we go on with the stuff.  Dude (Jason) talks to me sporadically throughout the night, while we're drawing names for door prizes, organizing the 3 on 3 BBall stuff, etc.  Then, after we've loaded everything up, into his truck to take it back across campus to put back in the office, we're walking out of the building together (he kept asking if that was it, if I needed help putting stuff away, etc) he was talking to me about stuff going on throughout the rest of the week, blah blah, and ends with "Well, I'll be around for the other events this week, so perhaps I'll see ya"  And I responded with "Cool, yeah, I'll be at everything all week".   It was really random, and I don't know if it was saying 'I'll be there, I'm telling you this so you know and maybe I can see you again' or what.  It came off as that way. He was just talking to me about random stuff all night, work, school, what else was going on all week.  And I think he was watching me a lot, but I didn't really pick up on it until the last part of the night, and I got in the car and was like "well, hot damn, I think he was "hitting on me".  Hmm, interesting.  Who knows if I was reading it right or not.  But, Lynne did say something at somepoint during the night like "He's a good guy".   Weird.    ANyway.  So my class tonight was cool.  Very small, and with one of my favorite professors, who is also my advisor.  Yay.  He's so laid back.. we do, however, have a 10-15 page paper to do, but it's an autibiography/family history kinda thing, so it won't be too hard.  TO get us to look at how our family, cultural background, etc affects us as counselors.  Neat.  Now, I have no classes till Thiusday, rock on.  BUT, tomorrow night there is an event from 8:30-11:30.. What's that about?  At least that means I get to go in later tomorrow.  Or, at the same time if I want to stark clocking in hours!!   Work was kinda fun too, seeing everyone again.  Only one person said anything about my  hair.  Rock on! (I darkened it, got rid of all the highlights, back to my natural color, which I'd forgotten what it was!!  Alice, Becca and someone else I saw didn't even notice it.  But, Carmen did as soon as I got out of the car at dinner the other night.  Weird.  I'll have to take a pic and put it up.   And now, I must sleep.

      I figured it out!!  I messed with the blog templates and got all sorts of cool stuff done!!  Got the titles done, the archives, links, etc.  Rock on.  AND got the background from my old blog!  Hot dog  I'm back in Clarksville now.. wooo.  I'm excited, sorta.  It was so quiet today, I miss home already!  =(  I got most of my stuff unpacked and put away.  ALtho, the living room still looks like a tornado came through. It'll get cleaned up in a bit though, when I do pilates.   I went to the Y today, and there were a ton and a half people there!!  What the heck?  It's never that crowded on a Sunday!  Must be all those people with their new years resolutions... GET OUT OF MY GYM!!  I hope it's not like that all the time now.  I guess it just seemed so busy/loud too because I was used to the quiet, tiny little YMCA in W-S.  They got some new equipment!  I hope they get more.  The Y in W-S had some fun weight machines, that I'm really going to miss.  :-P  Uhm.. going to go couch shopping this week, since I have 3 days of no classes!!  And, Sunday, I'm meeting Mom near Knoxville to get the kitty and some stuff I didn't have room to bring back with me. Hopefully we'll go shop in the big outlett mall there, in Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg area.  I saw a Disney Store Outlet when we passed... FUN!  That's about it.  I still havent called Robin or Justin, altho Justin has been online all day. I should IM him later, when I am going to be around for a while.  KM, Erica, Lauren and maybe Alice and I are chatting online tonight, and hopefully every week!  FUN!  So, if you read this and you want to join us.. we're doing 10pm eastern, 9pm central.    Now, I must go watch American Dreams and do some pilates.

      Ok, so the bizzare-ist thing happened to me in the Newark airport yesterday.  I had gone to the big food court and gotten a donut at Dunkin' Donuts, then plopped me and all my crap down at a table for either 4 or 6, I can't remember which it was.  The little side area that I was in was pretty crowded, but there was the whole food court left with lots of open seats.  So, I was happily eating my donut and decided to call KM.  I'm chatting away, minding my own business when this guy walks up with his bag of McDonalds food, and sits himself down not only at my table, but right across from me!?  I was sitting there with my junk all spread out on the table, talking on my phone, and he just sat down and started eating!?  What the hell?  I was blown away.  I was sitting sideways in my chair anyway, not facing the table, so I kind of turned away more so he wasn't listening to my conversation, then somehow gathered up all my junk while on the phone and left?!  I mean, hello?!  I could have sorta understood sitting at the   OTHER   end of the table, but right across from me, whie I'm on the phone?  Yeah, maybe he wanted to say hello or something, but dude, I'm on the phone, get out of my personal space.  Then, I'd been reading social psych stuff all day, about social psych experiments on conformity and bystander effect, etc, and thought "oh my gosh, maybe they're doing an experiment to see people's reactions to a stranger sitting down at their table."  But my word, that is the most bizzare-o thing that's happened to me in a long time!!  He didn't say anything, just kinda sat there.  And, since I wasn't really facing him, I couldn't really tell if he was looking at me or just eating his McDonald's or what?!  It freaked me out, man!!  PERSONAL SPACE BOUNDARIES PLEASE.   I imagine I'd have reacted differently if I hadn't been on the phone, but who knows.    Anyway, as you can tell, I'm back from NY.  It snowed a bunch Monday night, so we were all worried that we might not get out on time, but it being NY they took care of it right away. I flew on a "real" plane (big 120+ passenger) from Newark to Nashville.  So that was cool.  I was surrounded by tons of Mary Kay ladies, going to a conference/convention at OpryLand Hotel.  Lord.  Not only were they Mary Kay ladies, they were New Jersey/NYC Mary kay ladies, with their heavy Jersey accents and pounds of make up and gaudy jewelery.  It was quite funny, actually.  Listening to them talk about their pink cadillacs and stuff.   I got into Nashville a few mins late, but Robin was just leaving when we landed so it worked out nicely.  It was like a heat wave going outside after 5* temps and blowing snow!!  =)  I got the doggies this am, gave them baths, and then headed off to work.  Thye were not too happy with me.  Oh well, I'll take them for a walk when I get home from work. I was going to get up at 7:30 and get them but I was just tooo tired to get myself out of bed.   I'm wearing my fuzzy, warm new Carolina Panthers sweatshirt that I got off of ebay.  heheh.  All the Titans fans are not happy!  ;-)  But, other than that, not a lot going on at work.  I should be tallying up evaluation results, but I'm not in the mood to do that yet.  In a bit, perhaps.  I need another weekend to recover from this weekend.  I don't want to go to class ALL day tomorrow!! Ugh.   Ok, time to pretend to get some work done.

      Oh my god... did I really used to live in this cold weather?  Holy shit it's FREEZING here.  I had to wait outside for the shuttle to the hotel from the airport, and it took an hour for my feet to warm up!!    I have 3 pairs of socks on right now, this is nuts.   ANyway, I arrived with no big issues.  I had 4 hours to kill in Newark, NJ.  THat was fun, let me tell you.  At least I got a whole chapter and a hallf read for class.  That's something!!  I flew on little tiny planes too.. so small that my carryon size luggage had to be checked as I was gettingo n the plane, because apparantly it was too big to fit in the overhead thingies.  What the heck?  THere were 50 seats, I think the magazine said.. wow.  We had to walk outside to get to the steps to get on the plane.  WOW.  And, it was a 2 hour ish flight too... usually those planes are for short 20 min flights, what the heck!?  Oh well.  The Newark airport was pretty cool, lots of stores and places to eat.  I wandered around for a while, wasting time.  I probably walked at least a mile.  Fun fun.    THat's about it.  We went to visit Jean Landschoot, and all her family was there.  Very sad.  Tonight was calling hours, that we just got back from.  It's all so very sad. =(   Bill must have arranged with someone, to have this beautiful framed poem sent to Jean.. it arrived via overnight mail yesterday, that she had to sign for...  no one knows how he did it or who helped him... but it was about going on after your significant other dies.  It was so sad when she showed it to us.   =(

      but fuck a duck.  I hate my car, I'm going to push it off a cliff and make it look like an accident so I can get a new one.  Piece of shit, pain in the ass, I wish it would just fall apart totally.  I have never truly wished ill will on someone as much as I am now on the guy that sold it to us.    Ok, so the car has lately been running what I consider a little too loud.. not smooth, etc.  I thought it was just my imagination, or perhaps due to the coldness of the mornings, etc.  Well, I guess it was yesterday when I pulled out of the apt driveway and pushed the gas to the floor that I noticed, "hmm.. it's not going anywhere or shifting, and the gas pedal is ON THE FLOOR!"  So, once again I thought, perhaps it's cuz it's been sitting all night... well it did it all day, and revved the engine but never jumped gears.. it just ran really fast and didn't do  much else.  And, when I was just driving, it sounded like I had the gas to the floor.  So, I took it to the garage place right around the corner at 7 freakin' am today and left it off and literally ran the 1.5 miles home in the snow flurries.  Ok, fine, whatever.  I had my long underwears on, so I was fine.  Well, about 10 mins after Trish & I got back to the office (she picked me up on her lunch break..) they called to tell me "It's the transmission.  We can't fix that here." SHIT!!  So, they told me it was indeed not shifting out of whatever gear it was they said, and why it was running so hard and so loud.  So, I freaked out a bit, then called the VW place.  I talked to them for quite a bit, and they're like "Get it towed in here NOW so we can look at it. You shouldn't be driving it based on that descrption"  Shit the bed.  And, of course they don't have an opening till Wed, but they can take it now, look at it and work it in between appointments and have it back to me before Wednesday, hopefully.  So, I'm like well what am I supposed to do all weekend with no car?  Can I just drive it?  No, that's not reccommended really, it could just crap out at any time.  Freakin' A.  So, I'm talking to mom, AAA, VW everyone trying to figure out what to do with this.. so I finally called AAA and they towed it (for free, the VW place gave me a number but they would have charged), then I called a couple rental car places and found one that as long as your 21 you pay the same costs to rent a car, and with AAA you get a 4 door for the price of a 2 door or something like that.  Anyway, so I'm going to go get that after work.  Mean while, I just remembered my gym clothes are in the car.. shit.  Luckily not my Y card, so at least I can get in.  I can always go over there later and get what I need out of it.  Jeez a peez.   I'm hoping to get a hold of Carmen in hopes that maybe she'll let me have her extra car for the weekend until I can get mine back, so I'm not wasting money.  Assuming her husband isn't coming home.  She didn't know an exact date last weekend, and I haven't talked to her since then.  BLARGH.  OH, and here's to hoping that this will be under whatever warranty it has left, 5 years, 50000 miles.  It's a 99, so as long as it wasn't made in January, we should be ok. That, and assuming it's a "power train" or whatever issue.  Which, with our luck, it won't be.   It's a good thing I was feeling cute & happy today with my hair in pigtails and my Carolina Panthers shirt, and my awesome new couch that's coming in less than a week.. sustain that feeling... ERGH!!  Maybe I'll just sell the damn thing.  Piece of shit. Bite me ass munch that sold us that car.   Take a deep breath, be calm, it's somewhat settled now.. you have a car, you're not stranded all weekend...

      I just had to share my exciting news of the day!  I finally got to Nashville to go couch shopping.  I ended up at Rooms to Go... they had the best deals.  So, I went in looking for a few sets I found on the internet.  Then, I found this FABULOUS dark blue soft and cushy set!  So, I had it narrowed down to that one, and the one from the internet (kinda huntergreenish with tan and other flecks in it).  The greenish set (7pieces, end tables, lamps, etc) was about the same price at the sofa & love seat I ended up getting, but I don't need all that other stuff, I've got that already.  So, I got this HUGE deep navy plushy cushy couch and love seat.  I think it might even be wider than the one at home that everyone loves to sleep on.  It looks about the size of a twin bed!!  And it just snuggles right up to you!!!  I'm so excited!!!!!  I'm not going to get off of it for a week!!  (hah, I wish!) I can't wait for someone to come visit and test it out.  Amy, I especially think you'll like it!  ;-)  So, c'mon, come visit me again!!   I'll send pics when get them.. delivery is next Thursday.  I didn't think to take my camera with me today, whoopsie.  And I can't find that set on their webpage.. phooey!  I feel so adult, buying furniture!!  Uhm, what else?  It's been a good few days.  Very happy. =)  It's amazing how much a "brain purge" and a good cry can make you feel better.  Sometimes you just gotta just spew all the bad stuff out to make room for the happy things.   Friday I'm going with Trish (secretary in our office, the one I went to Gatlinburg with) to some cooking party, where they demonstrate how to cook these "ready to serve" dealios.. sounds interesting.  It's with all the people (or more likely all the women) that went to Gatlinburg with us, so it should be a blast. They've invited me to a couple of other things they've done/had, but I've been doing something else or out of town.  So, I'm excited.  I need to call Carmen and see when exactly Keith is coming home.. I think last she heard it was next Wednesday-ish.. so I'm hoping perhaps if it's not this weekend, I can talk her into taking a study/cleaning/freaking out break and come watch the superbowl & commercials with me. =)  We can play games and stuff and LOL at the (hopefully) funny commercials.  Then, it's chat time.  9pm central, if anyone else would like to join in.  Just get on AIM and we'll invite ya to a group chat!!  It's so much fun!!  And, then, as if getting my new furniture isn't exciting enough... my mom and grama are coming on Friday!!  Happy day!  Guess I should go get some studying done.. gotta kick butt on the first test.

      I just found a really awesome sounding place that I'm going to contact about working or interning.  They have a job or 2 posted in the Charlotte Observer online, so I've filled out an application, and I'm going to send it in along with a letter asking about internship possibilities!!  It sounds really neat, from their website.  urlLink www.progressionsinc.com   So, cross your fingers for that one.   Um... I'm leaving work in about half an hour to go on my couch shopping excursion in Nashville. Hopefully I can see what I want to see and be on my way back by 4, so I'll miss the horrible 5 o'clock traffic down there on 65/24.  It's nasty in the area I'm going to be going to.  Then, I can get back, have time to chill, go to the gym, and study.  Rock on.   Man, I hope I find something, cuz if not it'll be a wasted trip!!  If they have the same thing they have online though, it should be no problem.

      Well, for all those of you on the east coast, and not stuck in the little black hole that is middle Tennessee, enjoying all that snow?  It was 70* here in Clarksville today.  However, it is supposed to snow tonight and tomorrow, hence the reason I say I'm going to be sick. ( I say snow, more like flurries, with like 1/2 an inch possible accumulation.  But, maybe it'll be enough to cancel classes... since they freak out here more than in NC)  When the weather changes that drastically.. it usually get me.   Gross.  But, by the end of the week again, it's posed to be 50s again.   But anway.. that's about it for today.  I went to bed early last night with the intentions of getting up early to get to work by 8/8:30... uh how about no.  I just am not a morning person.  I got up when I wanted to leave the apt.  Oh well.  Not like I HAVE to be there.    Ok, time to study for my test on Thurs and play with the puppies before it's time for 7th Heaven.  Rock on.

      I have nothing exciting to report.  People ask me what I've been up to, or what's been going on, and I have nothing to say!  Which, considering other points in time, is kinda nice.  For once, it's just school and work going on.  I'm not stretched to the max, I have free time to just do nothing.  I wonder how long it'll last!  I've heard nothing from those 2 jobs I applied for, which kind of sucks.  I was at least hoping to get a call so I could have some contacts.  Whatever.  I need to dig out the number for the place that wanted to hire me last summer.  But, I also don't want to give up having this free time.  Getting some experience would be great, but I think I'd like to take advantage of my last semester as a student before I enter to crazy work wolrd of having no breaks.  I'm afraid if I do get something, I won't be able to go home for Spring Break, or random weekends, etc.  I have decided to look at ads in W-S, Greensboro and Charlotte (via online classifieds) and call the related ads I find, just to touch base and say "Hey, I see you're hiring now, but what about internships or something for the summer?!"  Cuz, I'm moving home, and going to do my internship there.  That is my final decision, assuming Austin Peay will allow that.   Good for me.  Maybe this week I can get motivated to do all this stuff.   I have my first test of the semester Thursday.  It seems like it's going to be too easy.  You know what I mean?  We've got all the questions, went over the answers in class.. so I'm like "Ok, what am I missing here?  It shouldn't be this easy"  But, after Research methods last semester (with Mr. Dr. Woods), Mrs. Dr. Woods this semester seems pretty easy.  They're a husband-wife pair, in case you missed that.  They both seem like they want the same thing on an exam, and since I did fine with Mr. Dr. Woods last semester, I think I know how to do Mrs. Dr. Woods' exams this semester.  Confusing, yes I know.   Other than that...  My mom & grama are coming to visit me in 2 weeks!  YAY!  I convinced her to come all the way over instead of meeting me in Gatlinburg to get the kitty. =)  Rock on. So, they're coming on a Friday and leaving on Monday.  There is an Austin Peay basketball game that weekend that I figured would be fun for my gma to go to.  And, perhaps if there are any puppies left at Mel's breeder, we can go visit them, if we feel like driving.  I need to go check out my couches that I've found on line too before they get here!!  Ack!  I guess that's about it.  There is really nothing at all going on right now. Oh. Carmen's husband is coming home in less than 2 weeks.  So, that's exciting.  She's excited and nervous and everything.  I'm exicted for her, but I'll miss doing lots of stuff with her for a while, cuz she'll be tuning everyone out for a while, I'm sure.  But, she's got lots of fun things planned for after he's been home for a while, so he can get to know everyone and stuff.   Yay!!  Ok, I've been watching the Golden Globes all night and have gotten absolutely nothing done tonight, or all weekend for that matter.  The only productive things I have done has been going to the gym.  But, once in a while it's nice to do that.  Hopefully, I'll get motivated and go to Nashville this week and check out the furniture places, and hopefully convince Robin to go with me and help me pick stuff out!!  So, off I go to finish up reading and get to bed to ready myself for the week!

      I bet that kicker for Carolina is kicking himself!!  I can't believe they threw the game away like that.  True, had they not done that, it would have been overtime, and they still could have lost.. but URGH.  What a disappointment after such an exciting game!!   At least the commercials were better this year... my favorite was the Budlight/Budweiser one with the yuppie & his trained pure bred dog and the "man's man" with his scrappy lookin' mutt!!  And half time was certainly interesting, hmm?!  ;-)  I so thought that it was planned, and that it was a "fake" boob.  I guess not from the expression on Janet & Justin's faces and the statements from everyone.  Always something with him!!  Anyway.  VW called me today to say it's not as major as they thought, something with some sensor, I didn't understand what she was saying, other than it's not super expensive and it'll be fixed tomorrow.  Supposedly.  I wonder though... after they couldn't fix the A/C how good they are.  Oh well, we'll just have to wait and see.  I have Carmens car for now, so it's all ok.    What else?  Oh, I did lots of rearrnaging this weekend, to prepare for the new couches.  I'm putting the futon in my bedroom, so I had to make room for that.  Now I've just got to get it in there. Hopefully I can do that myself.  No calls for the couch, so I'm going to call Goodwill and see if they'll come get it, and if not, ask the delivery guys to put it by the dumbster.  But, I want my couches now!!! It seems like forever until Thursday!!  ack.   The weather is lookin' iffy for Mom's visit, hopefully it'll clear itself out by the time they have to come.  I miss my kitty!! And so does Mel.   I think that's it for now.. gotta pretend to do some work.  It's rainy and gross today. And I do not want to go to class tonight.  I did nothing all weekend, school related.  Friday I went to a Homeade Gourmet party with Trish and her crew of friends that i went to Gatlinburg with (like a tupperware, mary kay, etc party, where someone comes in and tries to sell premade food and such), Saturday I went out to dinner with Carmen and some other people from school, and Sunday I went to Trish's for the game.  Crazy. They're so crazy, Trish & all her friends.  They just think I'm so cool, they keep wanting me to come do stuff with them, it's so fun.  2 of 'em (at least) have 20-something sons that they were telling me all about and are all about hooking me up with, so we'll see what happens there. One lives in FL tho, so I'm like "well that's pointless!!'  But,  whatever.  A date is a date!! ;-)  Ok, must go now.  Gotta read for class still, since I did nothing this weekend.

      How cool!!  My KKPsi little bro just IMed me to tell me he's got a little bro this semester!  I thought the Koalas had died out, because he's been inactive for a while, but he's finally had time to do frat stuff this semester, so the koalas are going to live on, assuming this newest one makes it in.  I'm so excited.  Now, I definitely have to make it to Boone!!

      Ok, this just totally cracked me up when I realized it while driving today.   Ok, so Pepsi and iTunes are giving away free songs (a 99 cent value).... well, since I really don't like Pepsi, I get very annoyed if I buy one and don't get a free song code.  But, since APSU is a Pepsi campus, thats the only choice I have.  So, I was at a gas station today trying to decide if I wanted to chance it and buy a diet pepsi (with a 1 in 3 chance of winning) or just get diet coke.  Then I realize.. you DUMB ASS.. a song is 99 cents, plus tax, I think.  So a little over a dollar.  A 20oz pepsi in a gas station is AT LEAST $1.09+tax.  So, in essence you're paying more for the soda than you would if you just bought a song.   That totally amused me.  I wonder if anyone else has realized this?!  I'm sure they have, but I guess the idea of something "free" is powerful.  So, no more buying diet Pepsi for me, screw it, I'll just buy the song and not take my 1 in 3 chances of "winning" one!  LOL  Simple things...

      Dude, I have not written in almost a week, holy crap.  That's a sign that I've been busy at work, and busy when not at work!!!  Imagine that?!  Well, ok, let's see what's first.. I guess my car, since I was ranting about that.  I got it back Tuesday, it appears to be fine, but I will be sitting on pins and needles for about the next month waiting for something else to go wrong, as I always am after it's been stupid.  What can ya do?  Uhm.  I got a 92 on my first test of the semester!!  Rock on!  I'm happy with that. I have another one this week, in a different class, so it's like the first test, since we have NO FREAKIN' CLUE how to study or what to study.. it'll be interesting.  Blargh.   So, mom and grama have been here since Friday.  Fun.  It's been ok, not as much fun as it should have been because Grama doesn't want to go do anything, but she doesn't want to sit here by herself either.  She doesn't really know where she is, and gets even more confused if we go out somewhere, so mom and I haven't been able to do much galavanting.  We went to Dickson to visit with Melly's breeder and her 2 batches of puppies.  They were soooo cute.   No pure black ones, thank goodness, or I might have had to take it!  ;-) We went the back roads to get there, took us less than an hour, so that was cool.  Then we went to Oprymills so mom could get some Revere pots at the outlett store.   We were going to go walk around the hotel, but Grandma was too discombobulated to go do that, and she was grumbling about walking around the mall too.  I know it's not her fault, but it's frustrating.  She didn't want to stay at home that long without mom, but she doesn't want to do anything fun here.  It's almost like having my dad here.  She can't do much of anything for herself anymore, and I really think she needs to go to an assisted living place, because she requires mom's constant attention.  She was trying to brush her glasses with her toothbrush the other day, couldn't find her way to the bathroom, and many other things.  IT's so sad.  And there is nothing anyone can do about it.  At least she still knows who she is and who everyone else is.   Taking mom around Clarksville, and Austin Peay, I was realizing how much I am really going to miss it here, if I definitely do move home.  It's just so cute and fun.  Oh, we went to Austin Peay Friday night for a blues concert, so she got to meet a few of the people I work with.  I was hoping they wouldn't leave bright and early Monday am, so we could go in and have breakfast so she could meet Trish and a few others... but mom has to tutor at 7, so she wants to get home by 5.  Oh well.  Maybe there will be some cheap flights on Southwest, and I can talk her into leaving Grama home with Dad & Kathy and she can come back over.   Uh.. Becca is coming to visit me on Thursday, I think!  She's randomly got time off from work, and called last week and said "Hey, can I come visit?"  How cool is that, Valentines weekend too!!  Rock on.  We can party like nobody's business and say "Screw you boys!"  Perhaps we can get dressed up and go out and treat ourselves to dinner and fun drinks.  And, of course, have a little par-te here.  I  need to call Robin and see if she wants to come up Friday and have a game night.   I'm so excited!!  I hope she actually gets to come, she was waiting to make sure HT would let her off.   I'm going to be sooooooooooo disappointed if she doesn't come though!  Trish's husband will be gone that weekend too, so she's invited me to come hang out with her and her boys, so at least I'll have something to do.  Cuz Valentines Day alone is going to suck ass.   Ok, what else do I need to post.. Oh, WEIRDNESS.   When we were visiting the puppies, I all of a sudden got really warm. I had my jacket and scarf on while we were inside, so I took that off and still was pretty warm and sick to my stomach.. and then got dizzy, so I told mom to go kit my finger sticker from the car, and then got really dizzy and sweaty, so I sat down and my ear started ringing.. I drank some OJ just in case, and felt better almost immediately.. but my test wasn't low at all.  I think it was just the cold that made me better.  I swear, that's the closest I think I've ever come to passing out.  It was bizarre.  I have no idea what the deal was.  I just all of a sudden over heated or something?!  Weirdness.  I've been fine since then.. freak out!!  I dunno what else. I need to get offa here and read read read articles that I haven't read all weekend.   More to come later.. but I'm chatting with Lauren, Erica and Katherine right now, so my attention is diverted.

      ARGH!  I've been running around like a crazy person today, tyring to get shit done for work that they told me about WEDNESDAY and wanted it TODAY?!  What the hell?  How do these people make the university run.  And, I mean, most of this stuff needed to be done when the programs and events were being held, not a semester later!?  ERGH!  I don't get it at all.  And, Lynne, my boss is not here today, so I feel like I can't do half of what she needs me to, because I don't know what she's thinking on the subject.  Ugh. Stupid stupid.  Plan ahead people!!  Ok, enough of that.  Robin & I are going to play tonight, hopefully, if she doesn't get stuck at work till crazy hours.  Sucko.   Oh, get this, speaking of Robin & work.. David has applied to come back to work at 650 WSM-AM.  !?  What a freakin' retard.  How he's going to do that when his precious Caren is still at App, I don't know.  BUt I can guarantee that if he does come back here, that relationship will end the same way ours did.  He certainly hasn't matured enough to carry on a long distance thing....  jeez, just make up your freakin' mind already.  You had a cool job and walked away, you really think they're going to hire you back?!  I think not.  He's never going to move on, he's always going to be stuck and complaining... he's been offered 2 other radio jobs but hasn't taken any of them.  Sorry, got off on another rant.   Still having issues deciding what to do with this friendship thing, and his horrible friend habits.  I'm not sure if it's worth it to say something to him or just leave it alone.  At this point, I don't really care, I'm not the one losing anything.  Although I really would like to tell him that he's not taking advantage of a possible real friendship, and being an ass to one of the few people that will be a true friend.    Ok, uhm, I'm not sure what else.  I'm waiting for Trish to get back from lunch so I can make her some posters and GO HOME!!  I need to work on Robin's quilt.  I'm so looking forward to a whole weekend to myself.  I've got so much stuff to do.. internship searching, start working on a paper and a project... ugh.  It's piling up on my desk!!

      Erica, your updates always make me smile or chuckle.  I was reading your latest ones, and someone walked by and was like "what are you looking at in there?"  And I just had to laugh some more.   I aspire to make my updates as amusing as yours are, E!  =)  I don't know what it is, but you just have a way of making things tickle my funny bone.   So, what is going on in Nicole land, you ask?!  A whole lot of NOTHING.  Yesterday, I decided to take the day off.  I woke up with a bit of a sore throat (fixed quite rapidly by a big glass of OJ) and feeling very sore and achey.  So, I was like "you know what?  I haven't missed a day of work in a loooooong time, so I'm going to stay home and sleep all day!"  So I did.  And it was fabulous.  I slept till about 11, then got up and moved to the couch where I dozed till about 4; watching silly day time TV!  My new favorite show is Ellen, she's a hoot!    Unfortunately, I had a never ending headache all day, so that was no good.    I think I'm better now, I still had a sore throat this morning, but it's gone now.  I'm trying VERY hard not to get sick, I can't deal with that.  If this friggen' weather would chill out..  it snowed 10 inches south east of Nashville, but not a drop of ANYTHING here.  Schools are   STILL    closed today from that.  So, now I'm just thinking it needs to start being spring like and get over the cold, since it's obvious we aren't going to get any damn snow.  grumble grumble.  I just want one snow day, with lots of snow, so I can play in it!!  I want to go to Booooooone and meet my grand-little!! I hope there are some events that I can make it to.. and the snow doesn't stop me.  I don't really want to drive through those mountains though.. I might just go home first, so I can drop off the dogs, and then just go to Boone for a day/night.  That'd work.  Random long weekend.  And, hopefully, my spring break or Easter weekend will fall on initiations or something.  Crossing fingers..  Ok, it's friggen FREEZING in my office, so I'm going to go walk around and try to get warm. Perhaps a chai from the coffee house will help.. mmmm.

      Mini freak out here.  Becca & I went to Nashville Friday night for some Valentines "party" that WSM was having. (David's old radio station).  So, we had nothing better to do and went down to check it out.  Not a heck of a lot of fun, cuz it was mostly "old" middle aged plus people.  No cute college age boys.  But, it was entertaining to watch and stuff, as always.  So, I was fine while we were there, but towards the end I was starting to get a bit freaked out.  Then, as we were driving home, it hit me in a big wooosh of saddness.  I guess because that was the first radio thing I went to without David, and while only 1 person was the same (besides Robin) it was still the same old stuff.  I don't really know what I was sad about, just an overwhelming few mins of it.  Probably just nostalgia and remembering.  That, and the fact that it was Valentine's Day.  Or, almost.  Sucky ass romanticle holiday that was made up for the card and candy companies.  Grrrr. ;-)  Other than that, our weekend was fabulous!!  We did lots of shopping, er, rather just walking around the malls and stuff.  We took an adventure to a "new" mall south of Nashville, in the somewhat hoity toity area.  That was coo.  It's owned by the same company as Hanes mall, so it looked very similar.  That was fun though.  I didn't buy much of anything, which is good. =)  We had fun drinks at Ruby Tuesday Friday night, then went downtown Clarksville looking for some night life, but didn't really find much.  So, we came back and had our own dance party. ;-)  OOOh, there is a new Bacardi Silver RAZ (raspberry).  It's FABULOUS!!  Saturday we spent all day, well, from 3pm on, at the mall.  Slept late, putzed around here.  I feel like I've been on a mini vacation, I wored for about an hour on Friday, so I was all discombobulated, thinking Sat was Sun.  WHoopse.  See what happens when I get out of my routine!  I have no visitors or anything exciting until the end of March which is Spring break.. how sad!  But, hopefully I can get into a groove with school work and get my butt in gear with papers and stuff.  It's been such a weird month.  We've only been back in classes for a month, I guess, maybe 5 weeks, but it feels like forever and no time at all, does that make any sense?!  I can't explain it.  I guess it's because I know I have roughly 3 months of classes left, and I know that's it.  So, it's going so slooooooooow!  And, because I know I'm almost done, I want to work less.  AHH!  But, I've got to get moving on finding an internship and doing my research proposal.  ACK!  I can do it, I need a swift kick in the ass though.  Ugh, I just want to be done already.  I really think having less hours and more free time is not helping.  Last semester I had SO much going on, that I had to somewhat structure my time and be in a go-go-go mode.  Now I'm just being lazy.   Oh!  I think I'm going to the beach for Easter!!!  A bunch of the familes that we used to go with from NY are all coming to Myrtle Beach this year, along with their kids, so my mom said she wants to try to go and I told her I'd go with her!!  I so hope it works out!!  I'm going to skip out on classes that Thursday and go home earlier in the week so I can have extended time!!  It'll be like old times!  We used to go every year when I was in elem and middle school.  =)  And, it's THE BEACH!  I haven't been in quite a few years, I think the last time was 2001, with Katherine and David and Phillip, at Phillips' parent's house.  And, I don't really count that, because it wasn't beach weather, and the beach wasn't conducive to playing on.. it was all stones!  Ok, gotta get some work done.

      Ok, so I have no idea how to really spell that, so I did it how it sounded.  ;-)  Oh my word.  Today was crazyness, but fun crazyness.  We had a "pep rally".  I put it in quotes because it lasted all of 10 minutes, and it was severly lacking in the pep department.  People at Austin Peay suck with school spirit.  But, we had close to 500 T-shirts to give out, and that was a MOB.  I tell ya, give something free away, and people turn into animals!!  Then, as soon as they got their shirts, they were on their way.  Greedy suckers.  But, the basketball players (men & women) were there, and some of the cheer/dance teams.  Fun.  Then I had 376 evaluations to count.  I didn't analyze them yet, just counted.  Yuk.  ANd half of them aren't really valid, beacuse people just did it to get the T-shirt and weren't there for the pep rally. !?  WTF ever.  I was in a spastic mood all day too.. so that made it fun.  We all were, I think due to lack of sleep all week.  I sat in the main reception area and chatted with the student workers most of the afternoon, while I counted, so that was cool.   Last night at the "American Wedding" thing, I sat out and talked to a bunch of the ASA's.  One of who I work with all the time, Ashleigh, who I've deciced isn't nearly as snotty and stuck up as I thought she was.  She & her best friend had the giggles and were telling me all about their drinking escapades; so I guess she is human and not super uptight.  It was fun.  She might be OK to hang out with.  :-P  What else? I finally printed out all of my "sell myself" internship letters, to mail out to places I've found in NC via online classifieds.  So, I just have to organize it and get everything in envelopes and I'll be rollin' on that on.   HOLY CRAP!  How could I forget about this.  So, I go to my first class THursday, and the professor lectures for about 20 mins on whatever we had been talking about last week, I think internal vs external attribution stuff, and all of a sudden he just stops and hands us a sheet of paper.  People start "gasping" and talking; turns out it's a schedule of when we're going to present our research proposals.  Well, 4 of us, and I was one of the lucky few, are scheduled to do it NEXT WEEK!  We have a week's notice to do a professional 10 minute presentation.  Our papers aren't due until April 15, there has been no mention of presentations being a month and a half beforehand.  So, people grumble, he tries to sell it to us as "people doing early presentations have an advantage: they'll get feed back" blah blah.  Earlier ones won't be graded the same as later ones, you might only have a few articles so far, blah blah blah!  What the HELL is that about?  How can you not grade them all the same?  How can you give us a week's notice to come up with a presentation?!  Hello?  Excuse my French, but fuckin' A.  That's not right.  It's a Thursday, I bet 98% of the class has stuff planned for the weekend, and no time during the week to sneak in a presentation?!  So, no one said anything too vocal, so I raised my had and said "I'm sorry, but is there anyway you can push back the first ones a week or 2?" (there were 2 empty weeks between the first 2 sets of presentations) "But I don't think it's reasonable to expect us to whip up a presentation of this magnititude in a week, over  a weekend we've probably already planned other stuff for".  He just looked at me and asked if others felt like this and people mumbled yeah, they did.. but no one else was too vocal about it.  He just said "well, it's almost March, you should be well on your way"   But he'd also just told us it was OK to change topics... WTF?  Man, he's such an ass as a professor with shit like this.  Luckily, someone said they'd switch with me if that was allowed, so I guess a bunch of people just switched.  So, now I have 3 weeks to pick a topic and get articles.  Ass.  I should go to the library on SUnday.   Ugh.  There should be some code that doesn't allow a weeks notice for this kinf of presentation.  (we're supposed to do it like it's our master's thesis proposal!)  So, I was so pissed, and then we started doing stupid shit in class that was not at all related to Social/Community psych, that I left during our break.  I had forgotten to set the VCR to tape Friends and ER, so I came home and did that, and ran some errands.  Jeesh.   Want to hear how exciting my Friday night has been?  I came home, cleaned my bathroom cuz it was getting "gross" (no where near Katherine gross, just gross for me), and then crashed on the couch.  I just got back from the gym, and I'm going to do some pilates and go to bed.  Perhaps watch some Friends.  ;-)  Party animal, that's me!

      Ya know what?!  Bush is a dumb ass.  If he wins the election, then something is very wrong with the people of this country.   I just felt the need to share that.  But, I think he's pissed off enough people by now that there is a slim to none chance of reelection.  So, if you're not registered in the state you're residing in, get an absentee ballot.  As we saw last year, every vote counts.   And that, is my public service announcement of the day.  Time to sleep.

      Man, I'm tired.  I feel like it should be Friday already!  Ack.  Last night we went to Murray, KY to Murray State Univ to hear Maya Angelou speak.  It was pretty good.  But, we sat in the bleacher type seats section, so my back was bugging me the whole friggen time.  Ugh. Which reminds me, I need to call the chiro!!  So, I had a staff meeting that I got to work at 8 for, only to have it not start until 8:50!  UGH!  If you say 8:15, start at 8:15!  C'mon people!  Then, that lasted until almost 11.  So, the plan to come home around 10 and go back to sleep for a few hours was shot.  So, instead I went to the gym, ran some errands, walked the dogs, and then it was almost time to come back to work by 2:30.  Where does the time go?  It just vanishes, I tell ya.  We didn't get back from the trip until almost midnight, so by the time we unloaded, took the Univeristy van back to the parking lot, and I got home and settled, it was close to 1:30 that I went to sleep. And, boy did I sleep!  Holy moly.  Then, had to be here at work at normal time.  Well, I shouldn't say that, I took it upon myself to get an extra hour of sleep and come in late.  Esp since I have to be here from 9-midnight again tonight.  Sucko.  I am so glad this is my last semester as a GA; I really have liked it, but I don't think I could do it for another year.  Of course I say that as semester burnout is really setting in.  But what can ya do?  So, what else?  I'm not really sure.  I'm sure there is something I should be doing.. (Random side tangent, almost EVERY time I type "should" I have to go back because I always miss the u, what's that about?)  Oh, I know!  I need to READ like a crazy person for class, because I've gotten nothing done this week.

      MMmm, I love Easter sweattarts!  I found chicks, ducks, and bunny shaped sweettarts, finally.  They stopped making the Valentine's ones.  sucky.   So, wow, I'm being a slacker updating.. I was just looking thru my posts, and the ones for January FAR out number the ones for February.  Weird.  I guess beacuse I have nothing exciting to post about.   I got seasons 4-6 of Friends on DVD, and have been watching them all weekend!  It's so fabulous. No commercials, and you can pause it when you have to pee or want to get something to eat.  ;-)  I love it.  Robin came up Friday night and we went to the most awesome Chinese buffet!  It was HUGE.   There were lik 5 or 6 buffet bars, PLUS a grill where you could pick your own veggies, noodles, meat and sauce and they'd cook it up right there for you.  Oh my gosh, I have to go back when I've not eaten anything for the whole day.  I ate a plateful and I was stuffed.   Oh my gosh, I love it.  Then, shock of all shocks, David called while we were watching Friends.  He'd talked to Robin earlier I guess, so he knew she was there.  But, we talked for about 15 minutes.  It was cool.  I told him he doesn't have to wait for Robin to be visiting to call me.  He's supposedly got an interview in Asheville in the next few weeks, so he said he's going to come over here and check on the house/kick the realators ass for not trying to sell the house and visit.  So that should be fun.  We'll see though.   What else? OH!  I made bread!  Apple walnut, mmmm.  I love my bread machine.  I also made pasketti last night.  Everytime I cook a real dinner, I am reminded of why I don't do it that often.. TOO MUCH MESS!!  Lordy, between that and the bread, I think I used half of my pots and pans and baking stuff.  It's no fun when you can't split the dishes with someone, even as much as I like doing dishes.  Ok, time for some leftover pasketti & Friends before it's time to chat tonight.   I love our online chats.. if anyone wants to join in, just hop on AIM and we'll send you an invite.  9:30/10 Eastern time.

      Oh my goodness!  I went to the library today, and that actually had 75% of my articles right there!  :-O  That's never happened before!   I'm still in shock.  The bad part of that is I spent $5 on copies.  If you request the articles from another library, they're free.  Oh well.  Now I just have to read them all for my stupid presentation in 2 weeks.  It's way time for spring break.    Work has just been crazy the past few days.  Lots of people in and out, it's just been weird.  I guess cuz of the basketball tickets we're giving away, and I think it's rush weeks or something too.   Ok, time to go home!  This has become my nap time.  I swear.  I go home and zonk out between 5 and 7.  Monday in class I could barely keep my eyes open.  I need a recharge, I guess.

      Holy moly.  Scandal here at Austin Peay!  Trish and I left to go to lunch yesterday around 11:30, and we noticed that one of the parking lots was crawling with police, complete with yellow "police line do not cross" tape!  So, we figured either an accident or drugs.  So, we go eat our lunch and run our errands, and come back and there's a flat bed tow truck taking a yellow jeep wrangler out of the parking lot, and there are even more cops buzzing around. Not just Austin Peay cops, real Clarksville ones.   Trish called her husband, who is a fireman and hears the calls over the radio, but he hadn't heard anything.  So, we walked in the building and were immediately ushered into the "big bosses" office, to find out that a student was found with a gun shot wound to the head! (no definitive answer as to whether it was self inflicted or not...) and that the guys girlfriend was in hysterics in the Student Affairs office, and that both of the offices were closed until further notice!  Holy cow.  I'm assuming it's a suicide, because if it were murder, I'm sure there would still be a crime scene and more  police action.   But my word.   You know, sometimes we think our lives suck, and something like this happens.  Nothing new this morning, but still I need to check the newspapers.  Holy cow.

      Let's Go Peay!  The men's team was undefeated this whole basketball season!  So, tonight after the game they had a big celebration.  Fun times.  The games were really fun. We did lots of random stuff; gave away free meal tickets, pom poms, and had students vote on next years Homecoming theme.  Neat-o.  It went by realllly fast too.  No where near as exciting as a Wake game or even an ASU game, but it was fun none the less.  Lots of cute frat boys.  ;-)  Ashleigh and I did most of that, and served all the greedy Govs Club members dinner.  Students too, but not too many actually came.  The freakin' alumni/community Govs club people were all pushy wanting their free food before it was time.  Worse than the students wanting free T-Shirts.  Good lord.  (that was between the women's and men's games) Lynne & I went into the game about halftime, and watched the rest.  Trish was there too, and she and Lynne were talking about something to do with ASA (Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority), I guess today was an alumni meeting or something, and Trish turns to me and says "Hey, you want to be brought in as an alumni member?"  I thought she was joking, and I was like "Ok, sure"  and she turned to Lynne and told her and Lynne was all excited saying "oh that's a great idea!!"  Then Lynne told someone else later during the game, so I'm not sure if they're serious or what!?   But, I guess Trish is the alumni advisior, so who knows.  They both were all excited about it.  I hung out with Ashleigh and her friend Elaine too, they were talking about how we should all go out or have a "bar night".  That'd be fun.   It was a very fun, interesting night.   Elaine and I were spotting cute guys.  She's "in love" with this guy Brad, who is in the I/O masters program; so she was asking me all about him.  It was a trip. But anyway, now I'm sleepy and I must sleep.

      Aw.  We were going over job descriptions today in the office, and we had to add several to my position, and Lynne, my boss, said something like "how about we just say we want Nicole for ever and ever?"   Aw, I felt special.  Earlier in the week she and Blanche were asking what they would have to do so I wouldn't graduate and leave in May.  haha.  =)  Too bad they couldn't make me a permanent position, and I'd seriously consider staying for another year.  It might be easier than trying to do my thesis and stuff from a distance!  But anyway, it made me feel loved.

      Grr.. Old Navy has changed their jeans.  I've been buying their low rise flare jeans for over 2 years.  Well, I shouldn't say buying, I guess I haven't bought a pair in a year or more.  But, anyway, I bought a pair tonight cuz one of my old ones bit the dust, and they fit different.  Same size and everything.  They're more low rise than they were.  Argh.  Why must stores do that? I'll have to wear them to work tomorrow and see if I can deal with them.  But, I did get some fabulous shorts, in hopes that I'll need to wear them during spring break.  Hey, I can hope, right?!  Oooh, and I also got Lauren's birthday present tonight.  Gotta mail it off so she gets it in time! I can't say what it is in case she reads this though)  I kicked ass on my test today.  I remembered just about everything I studied, so there is no reason I shouldn't get a high A.  Rock on!!  It was such a nice day today, not having class. =) I slept till about noon, got up, watched TV, studied, went to the gym, and sat in the sun and studied some more.  Perfection.  But, I think it's going to get cooler this weekedn, suck-o.   Ooh, maybe tomorrow I'll call the massage school and see if I can get a massage next week!!  My back has been killing me, I can't wait to go to my chiro at home.  He's so much better than the one here.  I'll probably end up having to go twice to get everything all straightened out.  That and learn to sit up straight.  I'm sure that would help.  Sitting in front of a computer all day isn't too good for ones back.   I spent about an hour today looking thru all my digital pictures that I've burned to CD's, and looking through all my photo albums.  I miss regular pictures.  I'm going to buy some film and take lots of pics while I"m at home.   Maybe even some black and white.  I really want to take a photography class.  We were talking about that at work the other day.  One of the student workers did that in HS.  That'd be so cool.   I was all excited; I found $60 flights to New Orleans, so I emailed E to see if I could visit them over Easter, but noooooo, they're going to be travelling themselves.  The punks, what nerve!!  ;-)  I could pick another random weekend, the fares are good through this summer, but I'm not sure how soon I have to book them.  Then I thought about going to visit KM/Lauren in PA, but I'm not sure I want to do that either.  I've been there before.   Tonight I got the brilliant idea that perhaps I could go to Buffalo and visit a family I used to babysit for and haven't seen in a looooooooong time, since the first summer David and I were dating.  Wow.  But, as of right now, those flights are $100 each way.  Suck.  I could also go to Springfield, MA, to visit Becky DeSmith, my 4th grade teacher.  E & I visited her after we went to NYC that summer.  That's where we got our ideas to get tattoos.   =)  I should check flights there too.  And see what they'll be doing for Easter.  I don't want to drive home, because it's only 2 weeks after I get back from spring break.  That's too much driving.  I could fly home too, I saw $60 flights there too.  We'll see.  Maybe I'll just stay here and work on papers and stuff.  Take a day off of work/class just for the heck of it.   OH!  I don't think I"ve told you that I might be doing some work with a diabetes support group here in Clarskville.  One of my, well, actually 2 of my professors, who are married, have a son with diabetes.  They've had a few groups, but nothing regular.  So, she happened to ask me about something her son was doing and I told her I did stuff with camp and stuff, and she said "oh, would you like to help us?"  So, I have to go meet with her later next week and she's going to help me get together a "proposal" to help me get some sort of position, even if it's volunteer, with hospitals.  She said to help me with Vandy, but it's too late for that.   Ok, that's enough.  Must go to bed, I spose.  Cuz I have to get up and to work by   11am!   Night folks!

      I am going to seriously hurt my dogs if they don't stop chewing up the damn trash.  I'm sick and tired of coming home to a mess; I try to be nice and leave them out when I'm gone for less than 2 hours, and what do I get for that?  UGH!  I'm sick of them.  Someone come take them all away.  Freakin' A.  I played with Melly for about half an hour today too, right before I left; took them for a walk, sat with them, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!?  Bite me.   In other news, tomorrow will be a nice day, beacuse I don't have my pain in the ass social psych class, so I'm doing nothing until 5pm.  Hot damn!!  =)  I'm going to sleeeeeeeeeep.  Every day this week I've come home and zonked out for at least an hour.  I think I'm getting sick.  I"ve been sneezing, and today I've had the hints of a sore throat.  Harumph.   Tomorrow, I need to figure out how to ask Trish what's the deal with this "fix up".  SHe's not said anything more to me about it, but she's told people that she's gonna fix me up.. so what's up with that?  C'mon now, I want action now!!  =)  Starting to plan things for spring break.  I want to go to the zoo, to Charlotte to see my sister and her kiddos, to Boone to do KKpsi stuff and see Susan, visit with my girlies, see David.. holy moly that's a lot.  I was thinking about trying to go to the beach for 2 days, but that's not gonna happen.  I also have to go visit Bobbi at the pediatric diabetes clinic, she might have some stuff for me to do when I move home, and even get me internship credit for it!!  =)  The endocrine dept had a psychiatry intern that started some sort of support group, and she's been in charge of it since he left,  but it's kinda fizzled; so she said she would love for me to help her out with that!!  Hot damn!  I'm excited.  I've heard nothing yet from any of the places I sent internship/applicatinos too.. I need to get in touch with someone at the Children's Home and other places in W-S.  I just did Charlotte-ish so far.  Oh, I guess I did some to W-S.   Ugh.    I've FINALLY gotten articles for my evil social psych presentation next week.  Nothing like waiting to the last minute, like I really had a choice!!  But, I've been reading, slowly, and getting some good ideas.  I'm kinda nervous based on what the presentations have been like already.. but I guess we all have different areas.  All the I/O people have gone, so they're all about business stuff.  Blargh.  THis is so not helpful for us counseling people.  Ass munch.    I guess that's about it.  I need to see if I can get Carmen to go to lunch or something this weekend.  I haven't seen her (other than in class) since Keith came home.  Maybe they've had enough alone time now, and she'll want to go shopping or something.  I have a shopping urge. ;-)  Ok, that's all for now folks!!

      Oh my gosh.   I am amazed everytime I hang out with Trish and her "crew", because I see more and more similarities between them and "us" (MTH people).  It's uncanny.  So, Friday night we went to this local restaurant, Cafe 541.  It's cute, but not that great and kinda expensive.  But, it's the company that counts.  So, I think there were about 12 adults, and 3 kids (Trish's and another little girl).  So, first similarity.. LOUD!  And drawing attention from the whole restaurant!  SOund familiar?  lol.  I don't think they go anywhere without making a scene.  So, we were all talking at once, laughing etc.    Wait, first let me get all these people straight for you.   Trish: work with her, take care of her kids, husband is Clint who can't be described with words.  I think I am most like Trish... Lori: Trish's friend, rode with her to Gatlinburg, husband Jimmy just came home from Iraq, they have a son JJ/Jimmy/James (he goes by all 3- I'll stick with JJ)  Lori reminds me a lot of KM Codi: another of the girls, husband Rick, recently married, no kids.  She reminds me of Tucker Evelyn: single (divorced), big red hair, very particular about her hair, clothes and makeup.  She soooo reminds me of Lauren.  Rebecca: she's the youngest, I think, married to Brian (who's a pretty boy), she has a 22 year old son in Florida.  She reminds me of Amy Jules: she's married to someone, I'm not sure, and has 2 little girls.  I've only met her once, so I'm not sure who she would pair up with..  Ok, so you can refer back to here if you get confused.  So, first I must tell you about riding to Gatlinburg with Evelyn and Lori, just so you get the whole story, and see why I say they remind me of who they do.  Lori was riding in the passenger seat, me in the back seat.  She was yelling and swearing at the other drivers, telling them to get out of the way, etc etc etc, telling us how she'd be driving if she were driving.  (which is why I say she reminds me of KM.. )  Evelyn, everytime we stopped, had to reapply her make up, fluff her hair, etc.  She brought like 5 pairs of shoes and had about 3 outfits each day.  And, while Lauren has calmed down a bit, it still reminded me of her and putting makeup on to go rent a movie or go to the gym.  ;-)  So, while we were driving, they were talking about their kids.. and Lori starts talking about her son, and shows me a picture, I think it was his senior pic, at least a few years old.  But still, he's hot!   Ok, so now we fast forward to Friday night.  After we'd been sitting for maybe 10 mins, Lori's son comes in.  :-O  Much better looking in person.  About 15 mins later they went around the table and introduced me & Meda to everyone we didn't know.  There were quite a few new faces, all of whom I'd heard about, of course.  Anyways, after we caused a big scene leaving, we get outside and people are trying to decide what's going on.  I walked out and JJ kinda stopped me and was like "Hey, Nicole, it was nice to meet you"  I didn't think anything of it, it was pouring down rain and I was being a door clog.  They couldn't decide where they were going, so I was like "ok, bye, I'm going to the gym I need to work out."  So, when I got to my car from the gym, I had 3 missed calls from Trish and another Clarksville number.  So, I called her back and she was like "well, um, we're over here playing cards at Lori's, and JJ's here and he thinks you're cute, and wants you to come over and hang out"  :-O  Dude.  A hot guy thinks I'm cute, I'm so there.   So I told her "let me get ungross and I'll be there".   I tried to call KM and Lauren, but they weren't home so I couldn't spaz.  :-P  Punks.  So, I went over and we played phase 10 till about midnight thirty.  Crazy.  I didn't actually get to talk to JJ about anything other than what came up over cards, but he seems nice enough.  So, Trish, being her un-bashful self, was like "JJ, don't you want Nicole's number so you can call her?"  So, I gave it to him and when I left he was like "Thanks for coming all the way over here"   Cute. So, we'll see.    Then Saturday night, we went to O'Charley's for Ricks birthday dinner, with even more people.  And more alcohol, so people were a bit louder.  It was hysterical.   Lori & her husband and mom came in after most of us were there and she says to me "We left JJ at home sleeping (he lives in Nashville, btw), but he wanted to come, but has to be to work tomorrow morning."  So, I'm not sure what that meant, but they were all "selling" him to me being that they were all around when he grew up.  So, we'll see.  Trish and I will have to conspire tomorrow and see what the plan of action is.  But, the dinner at O'Charleys was too funny.  Evelyn, being like Lauren, had to ask the waiter 20 questions before she could order her meal... Codi had a couple beers and got a little loud, they were doing cat calls and whistles when the waiters sang to Rick.. then we tried to make a mass exodus and realized no one had paid, so we milled around for a while.  I swear, it's like being around my own people!! ;-)  They're going to be my new best friends.  Then, we went to Rick & Codi's to play more cards until about 1am.  And they were all shocked to hear me say bad words and talk!  But, that's how I get when I play cards, but they're just like it.   Trish, Jules and Lori, Friday night were yelling "bitch!"  "whore"  "hussy" etc.  It was too funny.   Oh my.  I'm going to miss them when I move.   Each day I think it's getting harder to think about leaving. =(  But, it's just as hard to think about being so far away from home too..

      I'm home, in NC, surrounded by family and wuppies, with no work and no classes to pester me!  How perfect is that?!     I arrived a few minutes after noon, which was awesome time.  I left at 4am CST, only getting stuck in about  maybe   10 minutes of what I assume was rush hour traffic in Knoxville.   For some reason I thought it took 4 hours to get to Knoxville from Clarksville, but no, it's only about 3.  So I got there right at 8am EST.  It really wasn't that bad, not nearly as bad as Nashville am traffic.  So, the trip was very pleasant.  I love driving middle of the night/early morning.  Until I got close to Knoxville, there were hardly any other cars around.   Oh, and a little slow down around Asheville, where they've got one lane in each direction of I-40 closed going up and down the mountains.  Why, I'm not really sure.  It's been like that since the fall, I think, and I've yet to figure out what they're doing.   Something with the center concrete barrier things...  So, yes, I'm in the exciting world of home.  I didn't do too much today.  Mom & I had Mi Pueblo for lunch, and mom, grama and I took all 5 dogs for a walk/run.  Melody and I were the only ones that did any running.  I think we went twice as far as everyone else!  But, we needed it after being in the car for 7+ hours.  Then, it was such a pretty day that I played around outside, shotting baskets, washing my car, playing with the wups.  I'm hoping it'll stay nice tomorrow so I can take my pile of reading that I have and just sit in the sun, so it at least looks like I went somewhere fun for break!   Either Saturday or Sunday we might go drive around and check out apartments.  I don't want to jinx it, but this is really the only time I have to do this, unless I come home for Easter again.  Ugh, the thought of that is not pleasant.   OH!  I could I forget!  I have to go back earlier than planned (just a day) so I can do the Clarksville diabetes support group with my professors!! Rock on!  I met with (Mrs) Dr. Woods, my Lifespan Development professor, on Thursday, about how to go about getting a "real" volunteer position at Vandy, or anywhere else for that matter.  She had some good ideas.. mainly that in order to get in somewhere I don't have a contact, is to pose it as research.  She got all excited talking about studies we could develop, and if I wanted to change my mind and do a thesis she would come up with the study and I'd just carry it out, and do the "counseling" with the kids!  I'm not too sure of that, especially in light of the fact that I plan to leave in May.  BUt, it's something to think about.  It'd be really neat to do, even if it weren't for the purpose of my thesis.  So, we'll see.  I guess it all depends on what happens Wednesday at The CHildren's Home.   So many things coming at me at once!!  Now we just need to throw a boy in the mix!  I honestly dn't know why I'm still awake.. I've been up for 20 hours, HOLY HELL!!  But, I took a power nap for like an hour while my mom and gma were playing skip bo.  Then Mom and I went to WalMart and I got re-energized. I jumped on the trampoline for 15 mins, cuz I didn't make it to the gym today.  I'm going to be SOO sore tomorrow, between that and running.  (While I was in NY I jumped on my cousins, and the next few days all sorts of weird muscles hurt!  She says doing that is better than running!)  I feel so special.. Erica linked me to her webpage!!  What a cool person she is!  =)  Tomorrow if I'm bored, I'll have to check out all the other links from her post.  I like reading random people's (that I know by association) blogs.  It's fun!

      :-O  I have an interview for a job/internship at the Children's Home!!!!  I've been emailing with the HR woman, and she seems very positive about me getting something there!!  So, please cross your fingers for me!!!  This would be too perfect.  My interview/meeting is next Wednesday, while I'm home for spring break.  So extra crossing of appendages that morning would be appreciated!!  AND, I've come up with a kick ass idea for my idiotic social & community psych paper.   I'm using the basic idea from my research methods one, and adding a conformity/peer pressure aspect to it!  Rock on.  I just have to figure out the wording and add in to the paper.  Kick butt!!  AND, both of these papers, plus one I did my first semester are going to combine to be my research lit review for my "thesis".  So, I just have to copy and paste and stuff and have my committee look at it.  (This alternate choice that I'm doing is a LOT less involved than a thesis.  No IRB approval needed, I just have to demonstrate adequate writing skills and knowledge of research methods, or something like that.  Gotta get that done before I can officially start an internship, but it's no biggie.  =)    So, today was overall a good day!  Minus the fact that Melody the chewing monster has chewed up ANOTHER pair of my goggles from my gym bag.  I don't think I even left it on the floor this time.  The litte shit pulled it off the shelf or the couch or something.  Hussy.  I'm so freakin' sick of her; if she doesn't stop this chewing up stuff I'm going to whop her into next week.  (one of them, I'm not totally sure which one, has decided to knock over the trash everytime I leave them and don't lock them up in their little "pen".  They've both just about lost free roaming priviledges)  THe maintenance people are coming tomorrow, because there is water leaking from my ceiling over my shower... so I have to figure out what to do with the cat tomorrow.. son of a gun, what a pain.  I guess i'll take her with me and leave her in the car... I think if I lock her in my room she might meow too much while they're here working.  I'm not sure what I'll do with the dogs either, since I usually lock them in the bathroom.. what a friggen PAIN!!  But, there is no where else I can lock them.  Well, I could put them in my closet, but I'd have to pick up all my shoes.. no good.  I'm coming home at lunch time though, so hopefully they'll have been here by then and I can un-do whatever I've come up with for all the animals.   I really hope that whereever I end up in NC that I can find a house to rent.  Either that or I'm getting a 2 bedroom apt. I think my sister has one, and she pays less than or the same as I'm paying... I'll have to look into that when I'm home, if I have any time!! Especiallly if I end up with a paying job/internship, I don't think I can deal with the confusion of living at home again.  5 dogs about drives me nuts!! As I'm sure it does mom and dad too!!   We'll see.. if Becca doesn't get into one of her over seas schools, perhaps we can live together!!  That'd be so fun.  Or maybe I could talk Zack into it, if he's not moved in with Maggie by then.  That'd be a trip!  Ok, enough for now.  Staff meeting at crack of dawn tomottow, and then I have another meeting at 3.. that sucks.  I hate meeting that I have to go to outside of my office hours!  :-P

      Well, I just got done with my interview, and barring any horrible references and background checks, I should have an internship and job soon!!  :-D  Happy day!!  They have several positions open right now,  one being a rotating one, where I fill in for people on vacation to get a variety of experiences.  The woman was very nice and said she wanted to make this work!  I just have to get all the paperwork from Austin Peay, fill out an official application, send in references and transcripts and stuff.  Rock on!!  I'm so excited!!!  They have a training that is the second 2 weeks in May, but I don't think I can make that one, as exams aren't done until May 15ish, and I couldn't move home by then, so I'll have to do the one in June.   So, no official news, but good sounding stuff.  =)    In other news, Becca & I went to the zoo on Monday, when it was the coldest all week!!  It wasn't super cold, and it was bearable, but not perfect zoo weather.  The African animlas werent out cuz it was too cold for them. And the polar bear exhibit was closed, which was so not fair!!  But, we had a blast.  I put up pics on webshots, so go check 'em out!  Now, I must take a nap before I have to go to the hospital and visit with Bobbi about a support group.

      Ow.. a little too much time in the tanning bed today.. my back is a little pink.  And now it's itchy too!! But, I'm fabulously tan now, and look like I spent spring break somewhere exotic.  ;-)  Today was such a pretty day!! I was up oddly early for me on a Saturday, a little before 10!  What's that about?  Actually, I woke up and was like "Ok, let's take the dogs out to pee so they don't bug me later" (thinking it was more like 7am).  Imagine my surprise when I looked at the clock and it was after 10 already (in "nicole's room" time zone, where the clock is about 12 mins faster than real time).  SO, I decided to not be a total lazy bum, and got up, took the doggies out and then fed them & me breakfast.  Mine was much more appetizing; I had Leggo My Eggo waffles! (And in the mornin', I'M MAKIN' WAFFLES!!)  Then, I promptly plopped myself on the fabulously comfy big blue couch and watched a disc of Friends!! Perfect! The doggies and I played outside for a while after that.. went for a walk.  All of a sudden there was a Clarksville fire truck (it wasn't Trish's husband tho) right across the parking lot!!  I was like "Oh no!!"  But, they were just letting some water out of the hydrant; I guess maybe checking to make sure it worked or something?  I know they have to do that periodically.  Anyway, of course all the kiddos came rushing over to play.  I finally let Melly off her leash and she went and played with them- runing all over the place.  She didn't really  like the gushing water, but other than that, she wore herself out!!  Good job, kiddos!!  Oh, then I went to the mall.. I found 2 awesome bathing suits, since a couple of mine are so old they're about to fall apart!!  AND, JC Penney was having a fabulous sale, so I got them 40% off!  Rock on.  Then I made the mistake of stopping at Old Navy, where they were having their 10th Anniversary sale... I got a couple tank tops, and a pair of jeans for $20!  I love Old Navy.  They had some really cute capri pants, but I'm still (like I would have grown in the past year or something...) too short for them!!  They just like high waters.  I spose if I found a pair I really liked, I could hem them up or something... but that's such a pain.  And I want the fitted/ "boot cut" flare out at the bottom ones, so if you hem that, it might not look right!!  Ugh, sucks to be short!  Last night, we had "Skit the Night Away", a competition where teams have 10 mins to develop a skit using items in a bag.  We only had 3 teams, but they did a really good job.  And, I think if we have it again, it'd attract more people.  One of the frats did it, PKA, and won.  They are hilarious at stuff like that.  They had the whole audience rolling in the isles at the variety show for homecoming.  They were having some party or something at their house later, that they invited me to go to.. but I didn't particuarly want to go to a frat house by myself.  I'm sure they're all nice boys, but still..  no one who was at the skit thing judging with me wanted to go, and Carmen was sick.. so I just ended up coming home.  I almost called Robin, but didn't really feel like driving all that way to go do something with her & the boys.  Maybe next weekend, I need to call her and see if we can have a game night or something.    ANd if I can con them all into helping me pack up.  Ugh.  I'm so not looking forward to that... or driving a big giant truck.  Maybe I can talk David into coming over then too.  I know I can't use a pull trailor.. I have WAAAAAAAYYY too much stuff for that.  With the giant couches, and washer and dryer.... too much sheisse!!  I dug out old videos of "the gang" last night too.  SPent a few hours watching those today and last night.  Too funny!! We're hysterical.  I bet now we could sell these things into reality tv shows!!  LOL.  There's an idea... KIDDING!  But, lots of it was the beach.. made me miss it sooo much.  We have to take another beach trip soon.. I wonder if that'd be cheaper than Vegas.. altho I really want to do that too.  UGH!!  Actually, I'd just be happy with a whole weekend of us all in W-S secluded off somewhere.  ALL of us!  Maybe we can do that soon too.... but as soon as 2 people come back to the "area" (me & Amy), Becca might be leaving!! SUCK!   Ok, back to NCAA Tounrey.  Go Duke!

      Ugh.  That was the worst test EVER!  Not just for me, either.  Everyone said it blew.  Maybe we can whine enough next week and he'll throw it out and curve it.   Freakin' suck-o professor!!  Ugh.   What else to report?  Hmm..   Big stuff going' on at the Peay.  Smokie Norful (gospel) is performing at the Dunn Center April 23.  This has been a hassle since the start, starting with the contract and all their demands from Austin Peay.  Freakin' $30,000 for this concert, we'll be lucky if we break even.  I'm on the planning committee, which is just oh-so-fun.  I don't know yet what my job will be the night of the show.. but I"ve been booking limos, hotels, and all that fun stuff.  I hope I at least get to meet the guy, even tho I have no freakn' clue who he is.    We're also planning an "All Nighter" for April 30th.  Except it won't truely be all night, just until about 3am.  But, it's coming together fairly quickly.  I have to go around to all the Greeks and Student Org Committe exec boards and get them to help out, which should be great!  I don't know how I got put on this task, but I'm the only one that's showed up (from SLL) WHoopty doo!  Umm... what else?  I officially have my kick-ass apartment!!  check it out..  urlLink The Arbors     Click on Virtual tour or virtual office, something like that.  I'm in the 2 bedroom with den.  It's fabulous!! I hope when I get all my furniture in that it'll look as snazzy.  I'm very excited about the kitchen, it's a REAL kitchen, not a cubby hole!!  Rah!!!    I guess that's it for now.. I can't really think of what else I wanted to say!  I'll do it this weekend, I have a whole weekend of NOTHINGNESS!!

      Here I am, back in Clarksville, to work and class.  Ooooh fun!  (please, sense the sarcasm, altho actually it's been fun)  So, spring break FLEW by.  I still can't believe how fast a week went by!!  It was just so jam-packed!  You read about the zoo..  Tuesday I went to Charlotte to visit with my sister and the kiddos.  That was fun.  We got there about 3, and chilled.  Had a nummy dinner, played, went for a giant parade walk with the wuppies (I took Onex & Mel) and all of us and the kids.  It was a major production.  David surprised me by offering to come over and visit so I wouldn't have to leave everyone.  :-O  Holy shit.  Ihad told him I'd be there and I'd try to meet up with him.. but he is on overnights now and slept till like 6pm.  So, I didn't have much time since mom wanted to get back not too late.  So, he came over for about an hour or so.  I know he wouldn't have done that if dad had been with us.  What an odd boy.     Wednesday was the Children's Home, which I already posted about.  Then, after that I went to Baptist to meet with Bobbi, who has been put in charge of a support group that she would LOVE for me to help with!!  So, as soon as I know more about The Children's Home, I can let her know and plan the group!!!  We also went to a reception for Dorothy, who has been in charge of the Diabetes center for the last 10 or so years, and always does camp.  She's left Baptist and is moving to Colorado!!  To help them start up a program out there.  Anyway, they were having a reception/good bye for her that I stopped in at for a bit and got to say goodbye.  Aww.   I'm going to miss her. =(    Thursday was Boone.  I met Susan for dinner at the chinese buffet. MMMMM!  Then I went to App to a KKPsi meeting.  I got there just in time to sit thru a LOOONG ass meeting.  I didn't intend to be there for it all, but Susan had stuff to do.  But, it was entertaining at least.  Got to find out what's going on, "meet' the new people, etc.  Then, we went to Macados after.  nummy!  Joe, from diabetes camp was working, oddly enough, so we chatted for a while too.  Got to see everyone in one trip, cool beans!!  I ended up staying till about 11, yapping with a few people. Crazy.    Friday mom and I went out apartment hunting.  Man, W-S has a lot of places, but most of the ones we saw, the 2 bedrooms were smaller than my one bedroom!!  Nothing was as big and spacious as what I've got.  I didn't want to do another day of it, really, so I picked The Arbors.  They have a 2 bedroom with den floor plan that almost feels like a house.  It's really neat.  The kitchen is HUGE, and the "den" will be my computer room, and hten I'll still have a spare bedroom for you all to come visit!!  tee hee.  It's not even $100 more than I'm paying now, which is good.  It was a model, so it had furniture and stuff, so that made it look nice too.  I'm sure my furniture won't fill it up as nicely, but pretty close.  I'll make some pretty curtains or something.. I want to paint my kitchen table that I have now, and get new chairs.  I wonder what I'd need to do to paint a finished table.. have to check out ideas from trading spaces, LOL. So, if all goes as planned, I'll be moving in around May 30.  Anyone want to come help?!  ;-)  And, you can bet after I'm settled, we'll be having a big shindig!!  I can't wait.  Just keep your fingers crossed that everything continues to work out the right way!  I've got most of my stuff ready to send off to the CHildren's Home.. just waiting on my references to be filled out.  Then, I guess it's just waiting around some more to make things official.  ?!  My advisor is going to contact them about internship stuff, so hopefully that'll be settled asap too!!  Hot dog.  Oh, and I have to go tell my apt people now that I'm breaking my lease, which is going to cost an arm and a leg too, I'm sure.  Altho it's only by a few months....  we'll see.  Maybe I can have The Children's Home send them something and I can get out free b/c it's job related..  OH!  My sister from Atlanta, Christine, flew up for the weekend, to celebrate my dad's bday. (70th!!)  She and my other sister, Kathy, got their belly buttons pierced Saturday, so that was an adventure.  They wouldn't let us take pics tho, and we never did one of all of our tummies.  Next time.  It was funny.. my mom came too, since we went to the apt complex after to turn in my application.. and she ended up talking to the owner (Earth's Edge on Silas Creek) for the whole time, and when we got in the car she goes "I never would have had a conversation with her anywhere else" (she had tattoos all over her arms and legs).  "But she was a really nice person"  See mom, not all people with tattoos are bad!!  They're usually some of the friendliest people!!  Ok, I think that's it for now.  Gotta do a TON of reading for a test Thursday, because I did NOTHING while I was home.  whoopsie...

      Ok, I'm somewhat back to normal.  And, today was a good day to go back to work!!  It was the annual Austin Peay Health Fair, and the massage people were there giving free massages. mmmhmmmm, nice!!    Of course, I walked right into pandemonium with this stupid Smokie Norful concert.  Apparantly he is/thinks he is some big deal gospel singer, and has lots of demands. (Which is funny, considering he's this LITTLE guy, shorter than me, I've been told)  It's been nothing but a headache for the last 2 months, and as the contract was just signed last month, we're way behind in promotiong, organizing, etc.  IT's going to suck, and whoever's idea it was should have postponed it till the fall, at least.  But, what can ya do?  It's fun getting to behind the scenes, and be on the "Event Staff" committee.  Too bad it's not someone I care about meeting.  They'll probably do that next year.  thhpptt.  Who knows, maybe he'll become big and famous and I'll have a picture with him to show people.  Anyway.. tomorrow is another test.  But after writing out my notes and then typing them up and reading over them while at the gym, I feel pretty well prepared.  Just have to memorize a few more key terms as springboard points.  I'm not looking forward to getting the one from last week back. Ugh.  Friday is Good Friday, so no work again!!  Trish is having a cook out party that night, so I'm gonna go chill with the crazies.  She sent an original email saying her kids were going to be out of town.. then that changed so she told everyone they could bring their kids too and they'd lock 'em all in the house with the play station or something... so, being a smart ass, I replied to her "You should tell Lori to invite JJ, he's a "kid" =)"  I told her I needed some 20-something back-up being around all of the "old folks".  heheh.  Saturday Carmen is having an Easter dinner, so that'll be fun all weekend!! I'll finally get to meet Keith!!  And see Carmen outside of class.  SHe's so busy with her new job and having him home, that we haven't gotten to go out since February!    I guess that's it.  Melody is being a pain in my ass, and I spose I should take her for a short walk or something.  If it has stopped raining.  Gross.   OH!  I know what else!! We finally booked our hotel & flights to Vegas.  Right now, its just Lauren, Amy & I, but I think we can cause plenty of trouble!!  I'm flying overnight on the way back, which should be interesting.  But, that gives us more time to play.  I'm so excited.  The weather there now is in the 80s!!  Almost as good as the beach!!

      Ok, so I woke up Monday morning feeling extremely nauseous & dizzy.  I at first thought maybe it was because my blood sugar was a little low.. so I ate a NutriGrain bar, which didn't exactly make my stomach any happier.   So, I putzed around for a bit to see if I'd randomly get over it.  This has happened before, I'll just get a wave a nausea for like 15 mins and it goes away.  Well, I decided I might as well take the day off from work, so I went back to bed.  I woke up about 11, I guess, and felt the same or worse.  I had all intentions of getting up and going to class, but that didn't happen.  Instead I spent the afternoon throwing up!  Oh yay!  Man, that's the worst thing EVER.   I have no idea what it was.  Everytime I got up I felt like crud, altho after the last time I got sick I did feel a little better.  Needless to say, I didn't move far from the couch or my bed all day.  Ugh.   Then, this morning I was still woozy and dizzy and my stomach was still a little off.. so I stayed home again.  Gross.  So much for a 24 hour bug?  Maybe a 48 hour one? Either that or I ate some bad pizza Sunday night.  I can't remember what else I ate on Sunday.. perhaps a turkey sandwhich?!  Who knows.  I still don't feel normal, but a lot better.  I ate some pretzles and lots of popsicles and drank lots of Fresca.  =)    I did go out to the store today, cuz I was almost out of Fresca and I had no crackers or bland food.   Hopefully I'll be almost all better when I wake up, cuz I can't miss work tomorrow, lots of meetings.  And, I've lost 2 days of studying.  Altho, I did finish my study guide/test outline tonight.  But I'ld planned to do that yesterday so I had 3 nights to study.. oh well.  I'll be fine, I've had less time before.  At least it's on Piaget, and I know something about him from undergrad!!  :-P  I gotta get working on my paper too.. it's due on Tax Day!  I started to work on Robin's quilt ("Christmas" present) SUnday too, and was going to do that this week also.. maybe I'll have it done in time for Mike's graduation.  whoopse... it's the thought that counts.     Guess that's it.

      OOOooh, I got me "new every 2" cell phone upgrade today!! It is too cool.  Of course, I got a flip phone!!  AND, it's a camera phone too!!  Don't know how much I'll end up using that feature.. but we'll see.  I downloaded fun ringers and stuff!  For example:  My mom's personalized ringer is the Wake Forest Fight song.  Erica's is "I Want You Back" (NSYNC).  How cool?!?!?!   So, everyone call me lots so I can feel all special whipping out my flip phone!!  =)

      So, it always seems like things fall into place when they're not supposed to.  I'm having the most fun I've had since being in Clarksville now that I'm about to move home.  I've reconnected with Carmen, I'm having a blast hanging out with Trish & her crew (not to mention their cute sons!!), and I really like my life right now.  I'm actually nervous about moving home away from this little bubble.  Can you believe that?  I can't.  Well, I can.  Because this summer/fall, I didn't think I would move home right away.  I know it's the right decision, but it's going to be very sad.  =(  Carmen is moving home too, to Michigan.  So it wouldn't be the same if I stayed and she wasn't here.  But, Trish & Lynne and everyone keeps telling me they're going to make sure I fail something so I won't go.  It's so nice to be wanted.  I know I'll come back and visit, and will have people wanting me to come back, so it's all good.  I need to get in touch with Robin too, I havne't talked to her in a few weeks!!  I turned in my paper today.. After I realized at 1:00 (class at 2), that all my changes were saved on my computer at work!  :-O  So, I busted my butt to get to campus early and finish editing and print it out. Crazyness. I walked in and everyone was like "NICOLE!!!"  I'm really going to miss that office. I wish I could take them with me.  So, 2 more tests and that's it.  One next week and one the last possible day of exams.  Figures.  Altho it's not like I have anywhere to go.  Vegas is a week after exams end, so it's fine.    OH!  How could I forget the most important stuff?  Oh, well, I already posted the email from my professor.. but we've officially started the trail of paperwork for the internship!!  Rebecca wanted me there May 10, but that's impossible, so I have to wait till June 7, I think it is.  ROCK ON!!  =)   I think it's way past my bedtime now.  I have to get up early for a Friday.. chiro appt at 10, and I'm going to try to go to the gym before that.. we know how well that usually works.  :-P  Then meetings at 12 and 2 for work.  Then, some awards banquet at 6, and bowling with Keith & Carmen and a few other people at 9!  Busy Friday!    Oh, but wait. I just have to rant:  HOW COULD THEY VOTE OFF JOHN PETER LEWIS?? (American Idol, in case you have no clue what I'm talking about??)  He's so much cooler than that Jon Stevens guy.. if I'm being forced to choose.  I like Jon Stevens, because I'm a Sinatra and Harry Conick Jr fan, but not really for an American Idol winner.  JPL is just so cute, what was "America" thinking last night?  I guess I'm going to have to start voting!!

      Aww. I feel special.  I guess this means it's official!  =)  Hi Nicole,  I just off the phone with Rebecca at The Children's Home. It sounds like a great opportunity and I will get started on the paperwork. She told me that she was really impressed with you. I told her that we have been too.     Stuart B. Bonnington,  Ed.D.

      It's April 13, and it SNOWED today!  Big, fat, wet flakes, almost all day.  Most of it turned to slush and melted when it hit the ground, but it was coming down ALL FREAKIN' DAY!  People were coming inside with snow all over them like it was the middle of the winter (which we never had anyway...)  Oh my goodness, I felt like I was in NY or something.  This is not typical south weather!  Amazingly enough, no schools closed, I guess beacuse it started after 8am.   The ones here closed an hour early... but by then it was rain again.  I guess beacuse no one forecasted it last night.. FREAKISH.  I put a pic up on my webshots page.. check it out.

      What a crazy, fun weekend.  First of all, I just have to say that I love 3 day weekends.  Even when they're preceeded by a test on Thursday.   Friday was a fabulous day of nothingness.  I slept in, went to the gym & tanning, did a little shopping at Wally World, and played with the wuppies.  It was bEAUTIful. Went to Trish's for a cook out/bonfire about 5:30. Rock on.  The usual suspects were there, Lori, Jules and their kids/husbands.  Plus a few of Clint's fireman buddies and their wives/kids.  Fun fun.  We all brought meat and drinks and Trish made the side dishes.  YUM!  The first cook out of the season, yay!!  It was fabulous!!  Then, once it started getting dark, we lit a big bonfire and roasted marshmellows.  Too fun.  I love bonfires.  I wish we lived in the woods so we could have one.  Right by the pool, lol.  OOOH, speaking of which, mom has the cover off!!  =)  Anyway, after it got a little chilly, us girls went inside to play cards.  We played "Screw your neighbor", which is pretty much Uno with regular cards.  But, it was fabulously fun, especially given that I'd had a few Smirnoffs.  mmmm.  JJ and a few of his friends stopped by for a bit about 9, I guess it was.  They were going to gather "in town" (Trish lives in the middle of nowhere.. what's more exciting downtown, I don't' really know.. )  They invited me to come along, so I was like "what the heck, why not?"  So, we went galavanting, stopped at someone's house for a while, and then ended up in exciting down town Clarksville at a bar playing pool for a bit.   It was fun, and totally random!  I think I got home about 1:30 or 2.  Fun.    Then I slept till almost noon on Saturday, and got up and got started making bread to take to Carmen's, and it's a damn good thing I did it right away, cuz it took 4 hours!!!  ANy later and I would have been super late to her dinner party!  That was a blast too. First, cuz I FINALLY got to meet her husband, Keith.  It was a mix of APSU psych people and his army buddies (some with wives).  She made a TON of food, all of it fabulous.  The boys were out on the deck with their beers, talking man talk before we actually ate.  Then we made daqueris and played "President's & Assholes" a "card" game.  You deal out all the cards, and the dealer leads first, with whatever, and you go around the table trying to beat the previous card(s).  Once you play one round, the first to go out is president, and so on.. down to the last one out, the asshole.  The President can tell anyone what to do.. IE "take 2 shots", or "dance on the table".  Very fun. :-P  We'll have to try it next time we're all together.  Then after a bit of that, some of us split off and played Uno for a bit, and then joined back in.  We were all going to go bowling at about 11, I guess, but everyone wussed out.  Some of em wanted to go out to Kickers (bar/dance club), but there were enough of us that were like "uh, no".   Anyways, Keith was very fun playing cards with, he's very normal.  I don't know what I else I expected...   I guess they've been having parties pretty much every weekend, so his army buddies told me I was invited to come along next one. One of the wives, who is only freakin' 21, does candle parties, so she's invited me to her next one.  How fun!  They were all really fun.    Nothing special on Sunday.  The Y was closed, so I had absolutely nothing to do.  I should have worked on my paper, but I didn't.  :-P  I cleaned and did laundry and putzed around.  Oh, I finally rented First Wives Club.  It was good, but since I read the book first, I was a bit disappointed.   Today was crazy at work.  Stupid Smokie Norful concert crap.. I swear, his ego must be big to make up for his size.  (He's this short- like shorter than me).  He wants his own limo to travel in while he's here; we can't do this, we can't do that.  I swear, we'd have had an easier time getting NSYNC or Matchbox Twenty.  I'd better get to get a picture taken with him, for all this shit work I'm doing for him and his concert.  grumble grumble grumble.   Ok.. gotta go get myself into bed.  We not only have a staff meeting tomorrow (earlier than normal even), but we have a wonderful Smokie Norful committee meeting too!!  OH BOY!

      Ugh, story of my life.  I accomplished NOTHING this weekend.  nothing nothing nothing, except socializing.  Which, sometimes is needed.  But still, I now have to write my entire "autobiography" paper this week and weekend.  But, I was just looking at it, and I don't think it'll be that hard, I just have to sit down and DO IT!!  Which is the hardest part.    So, this weekend.  Friday night, last minute, I was asked to attend and help out at the Ogranization awards banquet.  So, at 10 till 4, I rushed home to change into "semi formal" attire.  I wore on of the black dresses I bought last summer for Tucker's wedding.  I love dressing up!!  That lasted till about 8.  Towards the end of the ceremony, Trish pokes me and says, "look, I think my shoes are on the wrong feet!"  So, she's sticking her feet out looking at them, trying to decide if they are.. (they were, they were pointing out instead of in)  So, she told the others aroud us, and we all started giggle fits.  And, she and I were right in the front row, as the VP of student affairs is giving out the last few awards.  She's trying not to do her chipmunk laugh, and I'm convulsing internally laughing.  It was hysterical.  Then, she never fixed them!  Oh, man, we were all crying we were laughing so hard.  Then I met Carmen & Keith and a few other people from school at the bowling alley, to find out we had like an hour or more wait for a lane!  Apparantly this is the hot spot in Clarksville on a Friday night.  So, conveniently enough, they had a bar that you could wait in, so in we went.  We listened to a so-so band, had some drinks and a round of "Surfer on Acid" supersize shots, and then bowled.  I sucked, as usual.  I'd have a few good turns, and then nothing.  Ah well, it's not the score that counts.  The boys were getting competative though.  I guess I got home around 1:30.   Saturday I made myself get up by 11:30.. didn't do much though. I fell back asleep on the couch. whoops.. =)  Went to the gym and ran a few errands, I guess, then Trish called at about 5 to see if I wanted to meet them at the Rivers & Spires festival downtown.. I had just made italian salad and was cooking a burger on my George Foreman, so I met up with them later.  It was a beautiful day, almost too hot!! But, we listened to a few bands, wandered around; the boys (Trish's sons) got some homemade ice cream sandwhiches, and Trish & I got funnel cake.. MMMM!  Then, after that we went to Jules' house to play "cards".  We ended up playing Greedy, a dice game.  It was quite entertaining, as usual.  Trish was saying that they're going on a girls trip this summer, and that I need to come with them.  I think it'd be a trip if all of her crew and all of us went.. oh my word, it'd be a sight to see!  Maybe one day.. =)  She wants to take a trip to NC next year sometime to come visit me, so that'll be fun!!  We were out until about 2, I guess.  Then, I got home and was chatting with David until about 3:30am. He's FINALLY taken a real, full time with benefits, job in radio land.  A little station in Lenoir, NC, but still.  it's morning show, and he's getting paid a decent amount.  It's what he's always wanted, at least in terms of morning show.  It's not the market he'd prefer, but at least he's learned he needs to start somewhere.  I sure hope this makes him happy, because if it doesn't, nothing will.  He's coming to nashville on Thursday to load up all his furniture from his house.  So, hopefully I'll be able to go down Thurs after my test, hang out with Robin for a bit & see him for a while too.  He's bringing "girl" as Katherine calls her, and she has class till 2, so he's not getting there till 9 or later.  Which might suck ass considering Ill have to be back in Nashville early the next am... but it's an excuse to see Robin too.  Apparantly he's been singing my praises to Caren, because he's told me several times that she "really really wants to meet me".  Don't know if that's good or bad, but whatever.  We'll see how it goes.   So,  needless to say, I was worthless Sunday.  SLeepy & lazy.  No work at all.  I did get to the mall to retun a bunch of stuff, and finally to Sams to get gum and fruit roll ups!!  tee hee.  Oh, and I got Lion King 1 1/2. It was very cute!!  Now, I must go do some shit for this STUPID PAIN IN THE ASS Smokie Norful concert.  OOOh, if any of us make it through this week without smacking someone.. it'll be a miracle!!  I get the pleasure of going to the Nashville airport to pick up the band on Friday, who arrive at 8:45 in the morning!!  Which means I'll have to leave here by 7:45.  Gross.  And be up until God knows how late Friday.  I think, however, that I don't have to take them back Friday night.. someone else is doing that.  But, as I've told several people, The University, mainly Smokie Norful committe, owns me on Friday, how sucky is that? That'll use up almost all my hours too!!  Perhaps I should take a few days off next week... hmmm.. sounds good to me!  Where could I go randomly?

      The more I say it, the more chances of it being true, right?!  I sure hope so.  I can feel a cold hovering in me.  My throat is scratchy & my ears feel weird, like they always do before I get sick.  BLARGH!! No no no no!  This is not a good time to be sick.  Well, I guess it is, being that classes are just about over, but still.  No!!  I've been taking lots of vitamin C and tylenol and drinking lots of water.  My neck hurts too, which usually happens when I get sick.  GO AWAY, COLD.  NOBODY LIKES YOU!!    Other than that.. nothing new to report.  Went to Jules' house Friday night to play cards, which we never did.  Just sat around and snacked, drank, and chit chatted.  Fun times. I also had a massage Friday, at the massage school.. ooh, FABULOUS!  I want to go back again next week.. for $20 that's not too hard to do, either!!!  =)  Maybe once more before I move.  I need to find out where the closest one to W-S is.    I packed up a bunch of clothes, stuffed animals and other various crap in my room today.  I think that's about all I can do right now, that will fit in my car when I go meet my mom to take her the dogs before Vegas.  Then, I'll bring the van back here, and when I get back from Vegas, I'll pack it up full of boxes and stuff to meet her in Gatlinburg-ish again to pick up the dogs and trade cars.  So, that right there might take care of a whole room of "stuff".  Cuz it used to be all I used was my car and the van to move into App.. and that was all the same knick knacks and stuff... so we shall see.    Now, I must sleep to fight off this cold.  I fell asleep at 8 during Trading Spaces earlier.. that's sad!!  OF course, I had cooked myself a nice snazzy dinner of chicken on the George Foreman, geean beans & tomatos (David style), Velveeta shells & cheese, and nummy cinnomin rolls. =)  So my full tummy needed a nap.

      tee hee.    I made 2 more skirts, 2 more are almost done.  Still have to do the waistband and the hem.  FUN!  I wore one today, and one person was like "I tried that skirt on the other day, but it didn't look right on me!!"  I was like, "um, well, not really, cuz I made this!"  heheh.  Nothing much to do today, kinda boring.  I went into work late, and left early, heheh.  Trish the dish was home with a sick kiddo, and everyone else was in staff meeting all day.  BORING!!  I went to Target and Old Navy to find some tops to match my new skirts.  Rock on.  I'll be stylin' in Vegas.  =)  And skirts are so cool (as in temperature)  I'm not sure what else to write now.. OH!  Today is Melody's 2nd birthday!!  (14th in dog years!)  It is also Jon Cauble Jon Caubles; and Erica alerted me that it is Saddam Hussein's as well.  What a bummer to share a day with him.  We'll just pretend we don't know that.  :-P  hum de dum.  This is quite boring not having anything to do until I get my research paper back to edit.  OH!  I just realized that we have class on the night of the Finale of Friends!  Riiiiight, like I'll be staying there till 8.  PAH!  We had our last test last week, so we're really just "marking time" as Erica put it.  SO, there is no point in staying.  I'll go, but skip out during break.  As I'm sure a lot of people will.  Altho, maybe she'll be nice and let us go.  A lot of the teachers have awards nights and stuff. I should call Robin & see if she wants to come up.   I guess das ist alles fur heute!!

      Oh my goodness.. I have so much to report on.    First and foremost, today I turned in my last paper, EVER!!!  Well, I shouldn't say that, cuz I still have my "thesis" to finish up, but that's in it's 3rd draft, so it doesn't truly count.  Hot damn.  I was driving home from class tonight thinking, "oh my gosh, what am I going to do with myself all week?  I have nothing to work on, NOTHING!!!"  It's so great.  I can come home, chill, finish up sewing some skirts, pack, and just live.  Wow.  But, I must admit, it is also kind of sad, as it means I'll be leaving Clarksville soon.  =(  I've recently realized how hard it is going to be to leave.  I've let myself become really attached to people here.  Case in point-  Carmen called me sometime Saturday afternoon, to give me directions to someone's house, they were having a margarita night.  Well, I never called her back, and then ended up sleeping thru the party, and her calling at about 11:30.  Then, she called again at about 12:45, wanting to know if I was ok.. she'd called and left several messages that I didn't hear because my power went out and lost everything, and that I didn't know cuz my new cell phone doesn't beep at me when I miss calls.  She had come over to my apt to check and make sure I was ok, but I slept through it (this was about midnight, I think)  All because I was a zombie thanks to SMOKIE!!  And now, onto my exciting 2 days.  First, Thursday was Pig Pickin' Spring Fest, which kind of bombed because it was rainy on and off. But, Thursday's are normally my day off, and since I was coordinating "AP Idol superstars", I assumed I would have to be there to run it.  Well, I rush around in the am to get there and Lynne goes "What are you doing here today?  I didn't expect to see you today!"  AHHHHH!  Oh well, so I helped out for a bit, then came back to the office to attempt to study for my test that was at 5.  Didn't work too well.  Went to class at 2, took my test at 5, was done by 5:30.  So, I came home, scooped up the dogs, and went to Robin's, to wait for David and Caren to get there.  I FINALLY finished the Titans quilt to take to Robin & Mike, and she LOVED it!!! Yay.  I got there about an hour before David & "girl".  Interesting, to say the least.  I don't know if she's really that shy, or she was overwhelmed by David, Robin & I being loud and yakking, or if she was nervous about meeting me, or what?!  But she hardly said 2 words to anyone but him all night, and just seemed kind of whiny and like she had better things to be doing.  I supposed it could be weird to meet "the ex", but if what David says is true, that she's wanted to meet me because he's told her such good things about me... but then, as E, Lauren and KM brought up in Sunday chat, perhaps he's just saying that to make himself feel better.  They couldn't get why she'd want to meet me, or why he'd be trying to sell me so hard to her.  I never thought about it that way before, I just assumed he was telling the truth.  And, it is very uncanny how much we are alike, I saw that in the few hours we hung out.  She's a lot more high maintenance than I am though..  I think perhaps "the expers" are right tho, she may very well have felt threatened by me, now that I look back.  Several of the comments she made, about knowing David for 10 years, spending time with his parents, or him spending time with her family.. that's all she could talk to him about, was about stuff only he would know about.  Like "This is mine, we have our own life" kinda thing.  Who knows.  I tried talking to her, asking her about them, her school, etc, and I never got more than a couple sentences out of her.  If that's not the pot calling the kettle black.  But, I guess I've changed a lot in that respect.. being able to meet people and talk comfortably with them.  I hope I never gave off the impression that she did by being somewhat quiet and shy.   One last note, which I realized yesterday, I guess it was.. Thursday was April 22.. what would have been mine & David's 3 year anniversary.  I kind of noticed it in passing earlier in the week, but never put 2 and 2 together to realize that I was meeting them on "our day".   How weird is that?!  Then when I happened to realize it, I laughed.  GOod for me.  =)  Ok, now on to smokie SMOKIE SMOKIE!!!  Well, first let me finish up Thursday by telling you I didn't get home till almost 2am Friday, had to get up at 6 to get to Austin Peay to pick up the van and some stuff from the office to get to Nashville to pick up Smokie Norful's band at 8:30.  Ok, all well and good.   The plan was to get them, bring them to Clarksville, where they had day rooms at a local hotel (becuase it apparantly wasn't good enough for them to sleep at...)  Well, we get there, and there are only 3 out of 5 that are supposed to be there.  One missed their flight, and one wasn't coming in, if at all, until 5.   What the hell!? Professionalism?!  Uhm, yeah.  So, we take them to the airport hotel they were staying at, and they all want to go right to sleep, instead of going to Clarskville.  So, Richard (some big wig at the University) & I wait around for about 2 hours for the next person to land, she wants to stay in Nasville with the others until it's time to come back to C-ville.  By this time it's 12:30.  So, I come back to Clarksville, dead tired.  I'd expected to have from like 11-3pm free, to nap and go to the gym, but NOOOoo!  So, I came home, checked in on the doggies, and then had to be at sound check at 2:30ish.  Ugh. All I wanted to do was crawl on the floor and sleep.  But no, had to help do lighting and sound stuff.  At least that was fun.  I got to help with sound check, talk into the mics, test the lights on the big fancy light board, and play with buttons on the sound board.. it was to fun.  Then, we had our event staff meeting, got assignments, etc.  The band finally got to do sound check, about 2 hours late.  In the mean time, there was mass confusion over the last person to come in and how he was going to get to Austin Peay.. finally Lynne told them "tough, he's riding in the limo with Smokie, get over it."  SO that was taken care of.  I had to drive the band to their Clarksville hotel for a little over an hour, while they got dressed.  I went home and took a shower, thank goodness, I felt gross.  Then, picked them up and shuttled them back to the venue and to reunite with Smokie.  I got to go in and meet him.  He's a pretty nice guy, oddly enough.  He's sooo tiny, smaller than me!!!  And, he's got the cutest sons!!!  One of them was sitting on the front row, just in front of me, and he was getting restless, so I started making faces at him.  He loved my fish face.  Cracked up!!  Smokie performed for a whole hour!!  WOW!  Then, they all putzed around, while we were waiting to see how many Austin Peay vans they needed to get back to Nashville.  They finally left about 10, luckily I didn't have to cart them. Instead, I got to stick around and clean up.  We took down EVERYTHING.  Lights, speakers, sound boards, stage.  It was actually kind of neat, to see it all come down like that.  And I love doing stuff like that, moving, pushing, gettin' dirty & sweaty.   I guess it was almost 1 when we got done.  Holy moly.  6am to 1am, with  no sleep or rest.  Yipes.   SO, needless to say, I slept until almost 2 on Saturday; got up and went to the gym, putzed around for a bit, and went back to bed.  Which is where Carmen comes into play, and me sleeping through everything.  Oh my goodness, I have NEVER been so tired and exhausted.  Never ever do that again.  I didn't get a lot of sleep all week, so the last 48 hours caught up to me HARD!!     So, I think that's it for the past few days.  Now I must go catch some rays.  Only a few more days left on my tanning package. :-P

      Oh thank goodness for happy endings.  I knew that they couldn't end Friends without Ross & Rachel being together, but there was always that surprise ending scenario.  But, she got off the plane and surprised Ross and they're together forever in our minds.  AND, Chandler and Monica ended up adopting twins, who they named Jack and Erica!!  Oh my goodness, isn't that bizarro?  I flipped out when I heard that.  It almost didn't register, I was so into the show.  Then I was like "wait, why is that familiar?  OH RIGHT!!"  heheh.  I cried my eyes out, both at the end of the final episode and at the end of the "montage" before it started.  I'm so sad.  Thursdays aren't going to be nearly as cool.  Why must all my shows go off the air?!  IT's just not fair.  There are very few good, happy, TV shows anymore.  Damn reality TV.  :-P  It's so sad, but I'm glad it ended the way it did, and on a happy, high note.  =)

      I can't decide if I'm sick or not.  Well, I am on some level.. I've been coughing a lot today, and my chest hurts a bit from it.  Ut oh.. and just kinda over-all feeling sickly.  And, I can tell something is wrong, cuz I've been sweating like a pig at the gym.  Grosst.  I know you just wanted to know that.  But, at least it's not knocking me out so I'm a blob.    Today Trish & I went  shopping at lunch.  She wanted shoes at Target, so we wandered around for a while.  She's so funny.  Her feet are so small she can wear kids shoes!!  tee hee.  We were walking to her car from the office today, and she says "Man, I'm going to miss you a lot when you move!!!  I won't have a lunch buddy, or anyone to be silly with at work!"  Awww.  This morning, she made a weird face during our staff meeting (which started an hour later than it was supposed too... growl!!) and I laughed at her or looked at her funny, and she went into a giggling fit.  It was hysterical.  I really hope she and the gang come and visit, so everyone can meet her.  Or, if they do a Gatlinburg trip again, perhaps we can coordinate with them.  I told her the other day how much alike "us" they were, she was like, "Oh that'd be so fun to see and have us all together!!!"  Too cute.  We're having a senior /graduating people party on Thursday at work, and they got us all something.. they were being all secretive today.  I guess they've got something big planned too... all hush hush.  Scandalous.   Guess that's it.. Still marking time until my last exam on the 13th.  Ugh, how silly.  I think we should just not have it.  =)

      HOLY POO, WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE???   (by the way, I'm talking about  American Idol )  Ok, enough with the screaming caps.  But Oh my god, I can not believe that LaToya got booted.  I'm actually not surprised Jasmine got to stay, every other week I've been very impressed with her.  And, I think people took Simon's comments as a challenge to get enough votes to keep her safe.  At least she has personality, which is more than I can say for LaToya.  However, I like LaToya more than Fantasia.  SHe pisses me off, and has from the start.  I still stand by my original prediction, that Diana will win it all.  SHe's got charisma, she interacts well with everyone, has such a bubbly personality.  LaToya does not, which is probably why she got booted.  She acts like she's too good for everyone, and doesn't connect with the audience.  She's closed off, Simon is right for once.  But, seriously, Fantasia is still in it?!  NO WAY.  Freakin' A, I couldn't even vote.  THe lines were busy ALL night.   I think this is the biggest upset in American Idol.  Not that I'd know, since this is the first season I've watched. =)   But still.  Hmph  In other news, I'm having a party in my honor on Saturday. Aww.  How cool is that?  (With all of Trish's crew)  They gave Meda a $50 check, man, I hope I get some of that love!!  tee hee.   But, since I'm not graduating officially.. sucky technicality.   I got my butt outta bed in time this morning to go have my "physical", rah. I also have a bladder infection, ooh isn't that fun?  But, it's lots better since I've had 2 doses of antibiotics and a pain/spasm medicine to stop my bladder from spazzing.  Yay, that would not have been fun to deal with in Vegas.  I'm glad I went and had it checked out!!  I also went to the chiro and got all straightened out.  AND, studied for 2 hours this am for my damn exam tomorrow.  I still don't feel any more ready for it, but oh well.  No one understood half of what we were reading, so at least I'm not alone.   I think that's it.  GOtta get stuff at work wrapped up tomorrow, so I can go to Gatlinburg on Friday and meet mommy.  Then, come back and pack like a crazy person for Vegas, since I won't have my suitcase until I get it from mom!  hah.  I did do all my shopping today for the trip, so I have everything I need at least.  Oh, gotta remember to pick up my black dress from the cleaners!  Ok, I'm totally wound up.  Need to use some of the energy and go do some pilates or bounce on the trampoline or something.   OH!  E- I passed along your comment about the relaxation thingy to my boss, she LOVED it!!  We wrote it down for next year. Altho our humane society closed, so I'm not sure if it'll work.

      I forgot to tell you, or maybe I mentioned it before hand.. but I saw "Troy" this weekend, the Trojan war movie with sexyman Brad Pitt. Who, I normally don't think that much of, but he beefed up for this movie, too bad his hair was long and straggely; kinda gross.  ANyway, the movie was actually pretty good.  I say actually because normally I don't like movies "like that".  War, history, anything non-romanctic comedy. :-)  BUt, I didn't really even notice that it was close to 3 hours long.  It went fast and kept moving.  Of course, being that I remembered my history, I knew what was going to eventually happen, but still.  I went with Trish & some of the gang, to Ft. Campbell (I've finally been "on post"!!) to see an "advance screening", for free!  Yay for military people's benefits.  ANyway, we were walking out, and Trish & Lori were talking about how they knew this was going to happen, etc., and Trish goes "I can't believe he got killed by being shot in the heel!!"  I was like "you're kidding right?  You do know about the Achilles heel story?  You knew that was going to be his downfall, right?" Nope.  HAHA.  I guffawed.  She knew it was called your achilles heel, but didn't know why.  How funny, or I thought so at least. :-P  ANyway, she said she & Clint would take me on post again during the day sometime before I move, so I hope that happens.  It was neat from what I saw of it.  You theoretically never have to leave.. they have EVERYTHING.  Well, no wal-marts or targets, but they have their own grocery stores, clothing stores, PO, a mini mall, movie theater, schools, restaurants/fast food.. how cool.  So, when they're on lock down, it's no big deal.   Ok, so I think that should do it for now.  I must go do some reading so I'm prepared for our study group tomorrow morning, for our stupid exam on Thursday.  Exam?  class?  what's this about?  I havent done that for 2 weeks!!  I'm out of school mode already!  Then, I'm playing Bunco with Trish & the girls tomorrow night, how fun!  I get a cool $20 prize, and I don't even have to contribute, cuz I'm a sub.  =)

      This is so cool, I love getting comments!! =) Congrats to Erica for being the first, and Amy for being the second!!  TOday I went to the dentist, and NO CAVITIES!!  I think the dentist in W-S was making it all up, I've not had a cavity since I've been going to this one here in Clarksville.  So, thhpppppt.  Then I went to campus to try to get forms I need to fill out to end my assistantship, but the dude that was working didn't have any idea where they were.  How helpful is that?  DUH. It's the end of the year, people are going to be coming in to get these things.  THEN, I went to my office, and everyone had gone to lunch.  Hmph.  I guess I'll have to get there before noon from now on so I'm not left out.  We all have to go out to lunch before I leave.  I hope I'll have enough time when my mom is here to take her in quickly to meet Trish.  I'll have to, cuz I want to show Kathy around campus.  Better late than never. :-P  I also did some packing, but I can't do much more, as I'm out of boxes!  Mom is bringing me a bunch when I meet her in Seviereville on Friday.  So, when I get back from Vegas I can pack like crazy, since I'll have less than a week until move day!   AHHHHH.  I don't know whether to be happy or sad.    Tomorrow is "relaxation break" during exams.  We're making smoothies, having massages, and relaxing music, etc.  It should be interesting.  I wonder if a lot of people will show up.  We shall see. At least I can get a free 5 min massage again!!  I should go have another one before I move.  =)  OK, I'm rambling.  Enough for now.  Night night

      Yes, no more "aha's" and silly posts. =)  So, interesting news.  I got an email from Justin today.  It wasn't totally random, I had emailed him a few weeks ago.. telling him what was up, that I was moving, etc.  I told him we all needed to have a big gathering or something before I left.  Or at least I think I did.  He replied saying something about I should definitely call him so we could find a time to do something, and he'd put on his thinking cap for something fun & interesting.  Weirdness.  I know I phrased it as "all of us should get together", but he replied like just the 2 of us.  INteresting last minute move.  So, who knows if I'll call him or not.  I might just have Robin coordinate something for the weekend before I move.    Whatever, I HAVE NO TIME LEFT to worry about this crap!!  I'm leaving for Vegas in a week!!  I have to drive past Knoxville Friday to hand over the pets to mom.  Holy crud.  And, pack.  Lord, I still keep thinking I have all the time in the world.  ahhhhh!!  I am excited and antsy to move, but at the same time, I don't want to leave!!  It's not fair. I'm going to clone myself and leave on of me here, and send one to W-S.  hmph.   Ok, gotta go to bed.  I have to be up at the ass crack of dawn to go have a physical for my camp application, to make sure I'm "physically able to perform my duties".. or something.  The physican's hours are 7-8:30am Monday, Wednesday and Friday.. what's up with that?!  Ugh. Altho I don't know why I'm  having it done, I don't think there is any way I'll be able to do camp this year, with just starting at the CHildren's Home.. we'll see tho.   nite all!!

      I have decided that Diana must win.  Not only because she can sing and she is full of energy, but because she has 2 dachshunds!!  When they showed her going back home to visit last weekend, they showed her being attacked by her 2 doggies that hadn't seen her in 2 months, which were a red and a black mini dachshund!!!  Too cute.  She gets major points for that!

      Ok, are ya ready for the play-by-play scoop on Vegas??   Arrival, Sunday May 16, 2004  Well, after I realized that Vegas is indeed in the Pacific time zone, I was ok.  We were getting ready to leave Houston (layover) and the flight attendants announced the flight time, which I can't remember, but it was too long to get us there by 1pm mountain time.  Then they announced Vegas time, which was 3 hours earlier than East Coast, so I was finally straightened out!!  We flew in over the Hoover Dam, which I only recognized because my parents have pictures of it from one of their many trips to Vegas when I was little.  It was beautiful, the water I mean.  It was bright turquoise, almost Caribbean-like!!  The mountains were so pretty too.  And, as you can see in the photo album, we flew over this desert-type thing.  I'm still not really sure what it was, as the flight attendants told us NOTHING about where we were flying.  Southwest is so much cooler. (I flew Continental)  So, yeah.  Got to the airport, taxied FOREVER!!!  I was amazed to realize that the strip was RIGHT THERE near the runway. The first thing I saw was the big Pyramid (The Luxor I found out later) and the giant Sphinx.  Got off the plane, had a potty stop, and went to get my suitcase, which was already going around on the baggage thingy!  Zut. SO, I busted through the mass of people to rescue it and was off.  Got my ticket to ride on a shuttle van and we were off!!  Timed that right, I tell ya.  It took maybe 15 mins to get to the hotel, I was the last stop, because we stayed on the far end of the strip.  I still can't remember which direction, north or south. :-P  The line to check in was insane!  That took me almost half an hour.  Crazyness in the lobby, I tell ya, people EVERYWHERE!!  After I unloaded all my stuff and called mom, I took a tour of the hotel.  Checked out the pool, the restaurants, coffeeshops, etc.  Then, I was going to take a snooze, but decided to go to the pool to do it!!  Fabulous! I talked to Erica while sun bathing, supposed to have been talking to KM too, but she was missing in action.  I FINALLY heard from Lauren.  She was only in Phoenix when I talked to her.  Ugh.  How boring to be there all alone!! I did finally take a snooze and watch some TV.  About 9, I guess it was, I went down to wait on Lauren in the lobby, but it took her almost an hour to get her luggage and catch a shuttle over!!  Zut!  When she finally got here, we went to one of the little cafes and ate some "dinner".  I had pancakes and she had french toast.  hehe.  Amy got around midnight, I guess it was.  Crazy.  We yakked for a bit and then hit the hay.  Long day!!    Monday, May 17  I woke up to see Amy already dressed and getting ready to head out to gamble!  Zut!  So, Lauren and I took turns getting showered, etc. (This was around 9 or 10)  Then, we headed out the do!  First stop was the Stratosphere, which you will notice I took lots of pictures from. We rode the "scary" rollercoaster, which wasn't too scary at all, just the fact that it was so freakin' high up.  No loop-di-loops or anything. Then, we stopped at some shops on the way back thru, and then were hungry so we ate at the hotel buffet place, $6 for all you could eat.  Not too bad!!  It had a little of everything.  Then, we dropped our stuff off at the room and continuted in the other direction down the strip.  We stopped somewhere, I forget the name of it, on the way, because Amy wanted to gamble there or something.  ANyway, I won $5!!  Hot damn!  And, of course, we got free drinks.  LOL.  We meandered somewhat hurridly up the strip, so we could make sure to get to the Excalibur to get our showtickets in time.  We were kind of trying to make it to the 8:30 show, but we got there at about 8:15 so decided on the 10:30 instead.  We passed several subways, so we went back to eat a real dinner.  Oh, we had also stopped on the way down at "Paris" and gotten ourselved a HUGE margarita in this montrous plastic Eiffel tower "glass".  It was insane.  We were quite tipsy when we got to the Excalibur, which is why we decided we needed real dinner. =)  Then, we wandered around more and got back to the Excalibur around 9:30 to get in line so we could get good seats to see "Thunder from Down Under"!  Rah.  We were surrounded by a bunch of "Tabor Ho" type people, how fun is that?  We didn't want to get all dressed up, being that we strated walking at about 4pm or so.  So, we weren't looking as glamorous as we could have been for the naked men.  Which AMy determined would have gotten us more attention. =)  So, we FINALLY got to go in and see the show.   It was quite fun and funny.  Not nearly as gross as "Louie the Snake" from Daddios in Greensboro however many years ago that was.  All of the guys were quite cute and not greasy and disgusting.  My favorite beefcake did a dance to selected Justin Timberlake songs, so I was highly amused.  =)  Then after, we took our pictures with them (I was upset, because I didn't get to sit on my favorite guys lap, someone else claimed me first!)  Then, they came out and mingled and signed autographs, which I thought was kind of silly, they're not really celebrities... but whatever.  We chatted with a few of them.  Mr. Beefcake was very unsociable.  He kind of went off in his own corner.  Must be a rough life..  ANyway, so we walked almost all the way back to our hotel.  We got to about 3/4 of the way, and decided to say "screw it" and get a cab.  Which cost us about $7 I guess, for maybe a mile?  SUCK. I'm sure we stopped and gambled on the way too.. I know I won another $5 that day..    Tuesday, May 18  Well, the day started semi late, for Amy standards!!  I woke up around 11, and she was dressed and ready to go!  So, Lauren & I got up, threw some clothes on, and we went down and ate at the buffet again.  This time we took fruit and stuff out with us.. sneaky!  Then we gambled some at the Sahara casino.  I wore my PJ's, which coincidentally were Old Navy shamrock pants!  How neat.  I didn't win anything though, maybe a few bucks here and there. After that, we decided to head to the pool for a few hours.  It was a beautiful day for it. Then, we finally got dressed and headed out to the strip.  We dressed for our night out, we had searched all our guide books and settled on Studio 54 in MGM Grand, a club, to go out dancing.  Rah!  I guess it was around 5 when we left the hotel, all gussied up.  We meandered our way down the strip.. I forget where we stopped. It's all a blur now.  I think we did M&M's and back to the Tropicana perhaps.. at some point, I won $18 at the Tropicana!!  We also went to New York New York, and rode the roller coaster!  It was awesome!!  We went into the Luxor (Pyramid) and roamed around, rode the "monorail" that connected a few of the hotels.  They have one running up and down the strip, but it's not open to people yet.  There is one station not done, apparantly, so it should be running fully the end of the summer.  Only 6 months late, according to my shuttle bus driver. We went around other places too, but I can't remember.  Oh, went to a Mexican place for dinner.  THEN, to the MGM and wandered around there for a bit, then to Studio 54, where there was a HUGE line.  Amy and I waited in it for about 15 mins before we got in.   Lauren had gone outside to talke to Steeeeve.  So, we got in, danced a bit, I got a drink, and then we waited for Lauren.   It was a hoot!!  I had one guy ask me 3 times to dance! (while we were waiting for Lauren, and then once after she got there and we were all going to dance together). Not a whole lot of cute boys though. Kinda disappointing. We did get whistled at as we were walking around on our way back to the hotel.  We hopped on a bus this time, which was much faster.  We started up the strip taking the Trolley (onour way to the MGM) and it took FOREVER, so we gave up on that.  We got back around 2 or so, I guess.    Wednesday, May 19  We got up early, so we could be sure to make check out time.  Checked out on the TV (How cool is that?!) and then took our bags to the bell hop guys.  Bought a day bus pass and headed out. We went to the Venetian first, to check out Rome.  It's beautiful!!  We ate lunch in the food court, OH, AFTER we spent about 45 mins in the Brookstone store testing out all the massage chairs.  nice!  Then, Lauren went to some art mueseum, and Amy and I went in search of the Hard Rock Hotel & Cafe.  Hmm.. the map lied.  It looked like it was near the aiport end of the strip.. so, we hopped on a bus, FINALLY, after walking halfway down the road it was supposed to stop on. Then, the stop we decided on, wasn't really near the hotel at all... so we walked the rest of the way.  Turns out the Hard Rock was about half a mile from the Paris hotel!!  Holy Poo!!  We walked around our elbows TWICE just to get to our ass.  Ugh.  Then, we met back up with Lauren and went into Caesar's Palace again, and got some more nummy Gellato.  ooh, it was to die for!  Then, we tried to see the Bellagio fountains, but apparantly it was too windy for them to be going?  I head some bell hop dude say something about it not happening because of the wind, so I assume thats what he was talking about.  We went into the Mirage too, and saw the White Tiger.  We got another Margarita by the Yard, some "High Octane" orange thingy.  NOt good, it had vodka in it, which I don't care for too much.  But, Lauren and Amy sucked it down and got quite tipsy!  Then, all of a sudden it was almost time to be getting back to leave for the airport, and of course, 3 busses passed us full to the brim, so we ended up walking all the way back!!  It was Amy & Lauren's intentions to get our luggage and hop on a bus (city bus) to the airport.  Well, I got back, got the bags  and the bell hop says "oh they won't let you on there with that luggage".  I thought as much.  So, he said a cab would be cheapest and quickest, so we got one.  Woo.  They freakin' charge you for sitting still!!  Argh!!  Then, when we paid the dude, and he got all huffy at us for not tipping him enough, and threw the change at Amy and said something nasty.  I was checking in at this point, so I missed it.  Scandalous.  ANyway, we got there early early, cuz the news had said security was a mess.. only to find NO ONE in line at all.  So, we all checked in, changed clothes and headed to my gate area.  We stopped and had BK and Cinnabon and acted silly.  Of course!!  HOly moly, I guess that's about it.  It was crazy and all ran together. I swear, it seems like I was in another world for 4 days.  And, the flight home didn't help.  It never really felt like "overnight".  I dozed for maybe 3-4 hours total, and didn't feel too bad when I landed in Nashville.  I did take a long nap later in the afternoon once I was home, but it wasn't that bad.   If you have never been to Vegas, you must go. It is incredible. Even if you're not into gambling.  My patience ran out quickly, especially if I was losing.  It is easy to keep shoving money in, but I controlled myself.  I think I ended up losing maybe $10-15.  Which ain't bad at all.  I think I won $30-40, but wasted it away.  My favorite part was getting free drinks while you gambled.  =)   I think we should ALL go back.. it'd be even more fun with all "the girls"!!    And now, I must sleep. I just saw Shrek 2 with Carmen & Keith... it's FUNNY!  But I'm sad cuz that was goodbye to Carmen.  =(  She might actually be staying here for another year, taking a new school counseling job.. which I hope she does, because then I can visit her when I have to come back for school stuff or graduation!!

      Hm.  All of a sudden, it has hit me how close I am to leaving here, and I am incredibly sad. =(   It's so weird to think that I won't be living in Clarksville this time next week.  Man, I hate it when drastic changes take place, even if they are my own doing.  I want to be closer to home, but at the same time, I could be very happy just staying here.  I'm excited, sure, but also very nervous/apprehensive about all this job/internship stuff.  It's pretty much "the real world", no more safe school zone.  A REAL job, REAL REAL REAL.  It's freaking me out.  I think that's also contributing to my sadness/nervousness.. what if I suck or don't like it?  Ugh, too many "what ifs".    I got the doggies today, it's so nice to have them home.  It was lonely here without them, although nice to not have to worry about taking them outside or locking them up when I was gone. :-P  NOw, I must sleep.  I'm still not caught up.  I slept like a log last night though, it was so nice to be back in my bed.

      Oh my goodness, I have to go back.  That was as fun as our NYC trip a few years ago.  Holy Poo!!  Well, check out the webshots, because I've gotten the pics up already.  I'm in the midst of trying to pack up mom's van right now, to go to Knoxville/Seviereville tomorrow to meet her and trade cars and pick up the doggies.  I got in about 8:30 this am, leaving Vegas at 10:30 local time.  Oy, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of overnight flights or not... especially when you lose so much time.  It was a 4 hour flight, and when I landed iin Newark, it was already 6am.  I didn't sleep too much, which sucks.  I watched the "in flight movie", which was Chasing Liberty, with Mandy Moore playing the President's daughter and trying to get some freedom from all the secret service guys.  Fun.  They really need to make airplane seats more comfortable. :-P  So, a good time was had by us all.. we went to see "Thunder from Down Under" (hot half naked men), to Studio 54 in the MGM Grand and boogied the night away, and of course, walked a gazillion miles.  I'll work on getting a detailed narrative on the trip up this weekend, perhaps.  Stand by until then..

      Well. my apartment looks much better than it did last night, so says my mom.  I guess it's coming together slowly.  My bathroom is about half the size of the one in my old apartment, which sucks.  So, today we bought an "over the toilet" shelf; hopefully that'll help.  Oh, and we have to find someone to mess with the dryer.  You see, dryers have special plugs, they're HUGE.  Well, mine is a 3 pronged one, and the wall outlett is made for a 4 pronged one.  So, my dad got a new cord, but I can't figure out how to install it based on the directions.  There is an extra piece of wire that doesn't match up.  We called the office but they never answered the phone when we called, and no one ever called back.  And of course it was too late when we thought about it again.  So, I'll just have to wait until Monday.   Pain in the arse.  Oh, and the gas company didn't turn on my gas, so I can't cook on the stove.  SUCK.   And now, I must swim.

      Everything is out of the truck, van, car, etc and piled into my apartment.  Holy hell, now I have to unpack it all.. HELP!!  Driving the truck wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it was going to be.  It was actually kind of fun, once I got used to it, and not having a rear view mirror.  =)  We had sprinkles on and off today, but nothing so horrible that we had to stop unloading.  The dudes that I hired to load it up were AMAZING.  They had it ALL in in less than 2 hours.  They were packing fiends!!  And, then it didn't take us much longer that to unload it all today, especially once dad's guys from work and Zack got there to help.  Yay manly muscles.  ;-) I've put a lot of stuff away in the kitchen, put together the entertainment center, my bed, and something else.  I'm so excited, I have a pantry, a squirty hose on my sink, AND a hall closet.  It's too much!  I'm so very tired though.  I get cable/internet tomorrow between 8 and 10am, and then I shall be back to the online world.  I'm at mom & dad's right now.  Not sure if I'm sleeping here or there, it'd make more sense to stay there, since I have to be up at the arse crack of dawn just in case the cable people come right at 8.  Now how likely is that??  heheh.  But, still, I could sleep an extra half an hour, but I wouldn't have TV to entertain me.  Of course, I do have my DVD player and lots of movies, Friends, ER and Dawson's Creek episodes I could watch.  Hey, there I go.  Ok, I think I might take a swum in the pool, the first one of the summer!!  YAY!  More to come later.

      So sad. Today I had a bunch of goodbyes.  Went to lunch with the Student Life & Leadership peoples. I got there and they were like "do you know where we're taking you?"  And, had I not driven, I wouldn't have known till we got there.  They took me to Chuck-E-Cheese.  HAHAH.  How fun.  So, we ate pizza and played silly games.  And, then we got in trouble because we got on the stage to take a group picture with Chuck-E.  Whooopse.  Too funny. That was very sad, saying goodbye to all of them, Trish mostly. =(  Then I had time to go to the gym, where I cancelled my membership as of Thursday, before I met Carmen for dessert at Olive Garden.  We actually met at dinnertime, but still ate dessert.  LOL.  Because when you go there, you never have room for dessert!! Very sad again.  When I got home from there I had a good cry.  Tomorrow, is Robin & Mike.  =(  I can't take much more of this!!!   But, then I was writing emails to people planning stuff for the week I get home, so I got out of my sad mood. But, I know I'll be back to visit at least once during the fall, and definitely for graduation, assuming I can talk people into coming to watch me graduate!

      Katherine will be in the state of NC in a very short while!  How exciting.   Too bad I don't get to see her till freakin' FRIDAY!!  What's that about?!  :-P  And, Speaking of Friday, if you're in the Winston Salem area, or even if you're not, IM/Email/Call me and get directions and come to the apartment warming party! =)   Today was spent by the pool, how fabulous?  I even cleaned it for mom, and did yard work too!!  Andrew, from next door, who used to be this little squeaky kid ("at the way way bottom") is now at MTH and all high school-ish- talking about girls and such.  Now, I really feel old.  Hailey K Jacob is coming to the pool party on Sunday, and I'm sure she has grown even since I saw her at Christmas!! Jeesh.   Tomorrow I am FINALLY going to the chiropractor.  It's about damn time.  I needed to go on Monday, but NO, it was a holiday weekend and he took an extra long one!!  SUCK.  My back has been killing me since before we even started moving.  Now it's just 100 times worse.  Altho, last night I did stretch on the big exercise ball, and that did help.  I really need a massage, but I just can't spend $30+ for half an hour.  If anyone is feeling generous and wants to buy me a random gift.. Altho, I could use the left over money from my Hanes Mall gift certif that I won when I signed my lease.  I spent $25 at Bath & Body works, and got cash back!  I didn't think they'd do that!    Ok, sleepy time.

      piles and piles of stuff to read and paperwork I filled out at the Children's Home today, probably killed a tree or 2.  Jeesh.  But, at any rate, I am all official, interms of being an employee.  I still have to have an interview to become an official intern.  Blah blah. Training starts Monday, no such luck having it delayed a week.  Oh well. That's the way it goes.  At least it's only 9-4 every day for 2 weeks.   Other than that, I'm settling in.  Most of the boxes are at least unloaded, and semi put away.  Still kinda messy.  I promise I will take some pics soon, so you can see the new place.   Right now, I'm kinda poopey.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm tired or what.  Just very sad, and I actually wish I were in Clarksville right now.  I think beacuse it's safe there, taking classes, working at a job where I know what I'm doing.   I'm very scared of starting this new job and all that it entails.  I still have that fear of "what if I'm a horrible counselor" even though I got great feedback from my practicum classes.  It's just so scary starting something new again. Even being surrounded by family & friends can't take that away.  I just hope I like it and can make it through the internship part.  Then, if I don't like it, I can go somewhere else.   I miss my Tennessee people. =(  But, Katherine comes soon, so hopefully that'll get me into gear here.   Oh, met another dachshund today on our walk.  Lord, they're all over the place!!

      I must live in the wiener dog building.. 2 of my neighbors have mini dachshunds!  Both of them are boys, too bad Melody has been spayed, or we could have puppies!!  One is blond/cream, named Jake; and the other is reddish, but not quite as dark as Mel, and is named Cooper. There is another one up the street too, but I haven't met him/her yet.  But, there are dogs everywhere!!  It's crazy.  And, so many people here.  Which I guess makes sense, it is the biggest complex in W-S.  I've met so many "neighbors", and of course I've forgotten most of the names already.  =)  I can't believe I forgot to post that!

      Oh, how incredibly sad!!  I switched my cell phone number today, to a 336 area code.  I didn't even think about the fact that this might mess with my voicemail.  My mom tried to call me earlier and told me that my voicemail didn't exist!  ZUT!  So, I went through the steps to reprogram it, and found out that the 2 messages I had saved from Katherine were gone!  How sucky.  You see, they werne't just regular "hey, it's Katherine, call me" messages.  They were singing messages.  The first one she left for me last summer, a week or so after David and I had broken up, and I was having a particularly rough afternoon when I got it.  She was calling because "I Want You" by Savage Garden (aka the "chicka cherry cola song") was on her radio.  So, she sang along with me, and ended it with "Have a good day, thinking of you, Katherine.  bye bye"  It was too cute, and I was laughing hysterically while I was listening to it (and, I listened to it during camp, so everyone was looking at me like "what the heck?!")  ANd, I have to listen to it every week to re-save it.  And I always laugh.  How sad.  The other one was her singing "Seniorita" by Justin Timberlake, and it made me laugh almost as much.  =) Let's have a moment of silence for the lost messages.  =(

      I may be short, but I'm scrappy!! (Katherine's new saying for me) Ha! I can now protect myself from all sorts of various attacks.  Watch out, or I might just put you in a basket-hold and TAKE YOU DOWN!!!  =)  Well, maybe not without telling your first.. I will definitely have to show off all my skills when I next see any of you, it's good practice!    So, yes, today we did all sorts of fun take down stuff, and it was really neat to know I have the power (theoretically, depending on how combative the client is) to do that.  It was, however, quite scary to be playing the part of the client and have someone make you fall to the floor and not be 100% sure that you're not going to go "ka-lunk" and bust your elbow or ass.  It's a very weird free-falling kind of feeling.   One of the girls in training (well actually 2, but the second one works at the Franklin, NC facility and was just here for this week of training) and I have become pretty good friends.  She (Melissa) just graduated from Vanderbilt, so she's been in Nashville for the last 4 years, so we were talking about Nashville/Clarksville stuff.  How ironic.  She is from SC, and just moved up here a few weeks ago.  All 3 of us became pretty chummy, and some of the guys decided to call us either "Dixie Chicks" or "Spice Girls", I guess cuz we were always together.  How fun, I love new friends.  Melissa wanted me to go out with her tonight, but I was just too darn tired.  Maybe next weekend.   Now, I have an entire weekend to DO NOTHING!  Ahhhh!  Well, I have to babysit tomorrow night, but that is not work.  It's fun!  Especially beacuse I'm getting my hair done by the kiddos.  They've already told me to be prepared for this.  lol.  I shall have to remember to take my camera so I can take a picture of the beautimus results.   And that, I do believe, is all I have to say today!

      Well, today was more of the same. As the week goes on, we are all getting anstier and antsier. (is that a real word?)  But, one good thing: we had a 2.5 hour lunch break today. They built in an extra hour for the medical administration training just in case, and we didn't need it.  We really didn't even need all we had before noon.. but oh well.  So, I got to go eat lunch with my mom & Peggy at Mayberry's.  Mmm. Hot fudge sundae, YUM! And, I still had time to walk the doggies in the nasty humidity.  Then, we had 2 hours of "Household Management" where we learned how to order food, supplies, etc for the cabins. (We have to cook meals for/with the kids) and about health regulations, stuff like that. Oooh fun!  At least this woman didn't read us word for word all the stuff.  She was like "I trust that you can read and figure this out, it's not rocket science".  YAY.  But, it still took 2 hours.  Tomorrow and Friday are de-escalation and something else training.  I sure hope it's enough to fill 2 days.  Maybe we'll get lucky and have a half day on Friday. =)   It was so freakin' hot and humid when I got home at 5, that after I took the dogs for a walk, we got in the car and are now at Mom's.  Just got out of the pool and now I might go back in!  I took Melly in too.  (she's been in before, but this time she swam most of the length of the pool).  I almost had her jump in on the first step, but Kirby (the doxie behind us) started barking and she went running off to see what was going on.  But, she did come right over to the side and let me pull her in, so she's not afraid of it!! =)  Fun!  ok, here I go!!

      Ok, so you want to know about training at The Children's home.  One word... BORING.   I know it's all stuff we need to know, but it's so freakin' boring. They're just reading to us from manuals that we could easily read ourselves and then ask questions about.  Ugh.  Everyone was antsy today, we were like a bunch of ADHD kids or something.  Tomorrow is more of the same.  Maybe Thursday and Friday will be a bit more exciting, since we'll get to learn therapeutic holds, and more actual therapy related stuff. We'll see.  I'm so sleepy, I swear it's more tiring sitting around bored all day than it is running after kids at camp!!    I know I'm assigned to Becca's cottage, but I don't know my shift yet.  It'd be cool if we got to do the same shifts, but I doubt that'll happen.  2 of the other people in training are in that cottage too, which is level 3 girls, the "worst"/highest level.  SCARY!!    Other than that.. not much to report from here.    Ok, enough for now, I need to get to the Y.

      Phew, what a day; what a weekend!  Busy busy.  Today was the celebration pool party/cook-out. All the kiddos that I babysit and their families were there, plus some others.  It wasn't a perfect pool day, but it was bearable.  Rah.  I am so tired right now, that I can't think.  I shall have to post more later.  Tomorrow starts my 2 weeks of "pre service training".  Blah.  I don't wanna go to worrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkk!!  I don't want to be an adult.  I want a summer vacation.  humph.  I'm sure it will be ok, I'm just dreading it because I'm nervous.  Hopefully I can update tomorrow.    Pictures are up on webshots, so check them out!!

      Interesting day today.  I shadowed Becca for first shift today.  It was interesting, but not in a bad way.  I got to see some of the attitude from the girls (we were actually with girls from both of the cottages, which is good since I'll be working with some of them later in the month).   Some of the time, I don't know how Becca didn't just tell them to shut up!!  It reminded me of the 2 months I took care of those snotty, spoiled brat boys right after I graduated from App.  Ugh.  THey just push buttons over and over, and are so defiant.  I think they gave me just about the same experience as I'll end up having with the kids at TCH.  I swear, from what I saw, the boys appear to be easier to work with!  Imagine that!  lol.  But, it was pretty fun.  I wish I'd be able to work with Becca more often, but I don't imagine I will, since Melissa is also first shift for the most part.  So, we'll see. I'm not quite as nervous as I was a few weeks ago. I think I shall be fine.   Other than that.. I don't know why I'm still awake, seeing that I got up at 6:30 this am.  Ugh. Tomorrow I am sitting my butt by or in the pool all day.  And, I'm waking up when I damn well please!  :-P  I was supposed to babysit tonight, I'm glad they cancelled, I got to go shopping with mom and just putz around. Nice. So, I guess that's all for now.  Camp starts on Monday!!  SOOOOOOO EXCITED!  :o)

      Today Melissa (fellow trainee at TCH) and I went to the Draught House or something like that, near Baptist today for lunch.  It's a bar-ish place, with lots and lots of beers. We decided we needed to have a drink with lunch.  ;-)  Anyway, we walk in and who should be right there behind the bar but Stuart Hipp!!  i sort of thought I recognized him, but wasn't sure if he'd know who I was.  I should have known, being that I've seen him several times since HS and he's always known who I am.  But, anyway, Melissa ordered her beer, and handed him her ID and he was like "well, I wasn't going to ask because I know how old she is (meaning me) so I figured you were the same age."  And then he was like "where do I know you from, Wake?  No? where did you go to college?"  Then he was asking a few other things, and I finally was like, Mt. Tabor.  At that point I asked to make sure he was indeed Stuart, and he says, "I know you're Nicole something... didn't you play basketball or soccer or something?, I know I know you from band, but I thought you did something else too".   FREAKISH.  I guess it was while I was still at App, that almost every summer I ran into him, at the VIllage Tavern, and some other place he was waiting tables.  Bizarro.  It was odd, because the other day I went the back way home after I'd gone to check out all the work at MTH, and thought of Travis Hipp and him flipping the in-car car at that curve.  AND, then Lauren said she'd recently seen someone that reminded her of him.   Anyway, he's going to be doing something that sounded guidance counselor-ish at a Military school in the fall.  Random.  I wonder who I'll see next, Lauren thinks it should be Marc Holton.   That'd be a trip.  Anyway, just thought I'd share!!

      But first:  Urggggggggh.  I hate traffic, especially when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere.  Sonsofbitches. Traffic on Reynolda was a friggen' mess!! I guess just 5:00 traffic, I haven't driven on Reynolda Rd. at 5 in forever... it was backed up from Fairlawn into Reynolda Village.  Who knows how long it would have taken me to get home had I not hopped on Silas Creek (going to Mom's that is)  And even still, the left turn lane to get from SC to Reynolda was backed up way past where the turn lane begins, so I went thru the light and did a U turn, then came back and there was a huge backup for the light at Reynolda.  AHHHHHHHHHHHH!  And, of course, I was already pissed because I left training almost an hour and a half later than was planned.    But, on the plus side of that, I finally got to find out some sort of a schedule.  The diabetes camp lady called me today, I guess she must not have gotten one of my emails or messages, because she was like "OH no, I have you as primary counselor in cabin 2... please let me know if you can't do this by today!!" (I sent her an email Sunday or Monday telling her that I STILL didn't know anything).  So, this pissed me off, so I finally got in touch with my supervisor, and very nicely was like "listen, I need to to NOW".  SO after we finished first aid/CPR, Melissa and I got to go over and meet with her.  And she talked for an hour plus (between interruptions and her just talking).  I was like, all I want to know is my schedule so I can call this poor woman back about camp and get home for my sister's birthday dinner!!!  But, I basically told her "Look, I've put these people on hold for a month now, waiting to find out a work schedule.  I've been put off and put off as to when I'd find that out, so now they're down to the last second, and I feel like I can't tell them no at this point in time, and I didn't want to say no before now, because that wouldn't have been fair to me if I had and then not had to work at TCH. I can do my day there and come in after that..."  So, she was like, do you mind coming in for a few hours of "training" those nights.  Phew.  So, I'm doing camp 8-4, then 6-9 at TCH.  Lord, I'll be dead.  But, it's worth it to be able to see my camp kiddos.  YAYYYY, I'm so happy, you have no idea how much this has made my week.  I look forward to camp from the time it's over one year, to the start the next. =)    Other than that.. OH! The week after that, I'm doing Tues-Sat 3-11, which will be fabulous for me.  I also found out that I won't be covering 3rd shift, they have their own RRC, which is another sigh of relief!  Hot damn.   I just got back from the Y, and before that, birthday dinner for my sister at Mom & Dad's.  We played a few games of skipbo, all of which my mom won... we think she cheated!  ;-)  I tried to talk my sister (Kathy) into changing her belly button ring, since the ones she (well, actually I) ordered off of ebay came, but she's determined to wait the full 90 days.  PAH I say to that.   And now, the time has come for Nicole to go to sleep.  It's way too late, especually since we have to be there a half an hour earlier tomorrow.  That's going to throw me off all day. We have OSHA shit, which I've heard/seen before, every year I've volunteered at the hospital I've had to sit thru it..  DUH.

      hahaha, do you guys remember that from HS?  Wasn't that something we joked about?  Along with "I can't pee!"?  Anyway, I went for the silly physical this am, and I didn't have to/couldn't pee while I was there, so I had to go back later with a full bladder.  The nurse got an attitude about it.  Dude, sometimes you just can't pee!!  Get over it.  She had an attitude every time I saw her. Annoying.  Not only that, but I got there about 5 after 8, and left about 9:10, it took that long to wait for someone to come in.  Then the PA took a whole 5 mins to do the "physical".  what the hell ever.  I probably could have done the urine test then, had it not been 15 mins after I was supposed to be at training when the PA left the room!  ACK.  (Yes, E, I had one for my camp application in May, but they wanted it done at their specified place; and I had to have a TB skin test, and a drug screen... to make sure I've really gotten over my crack habbit. ;-) )  Luckily, I got to the Children's Home just as they were really starting.  They had taken a tour or something around the "cottages", and were just sitting down to start.  It ended up being a total waste of time; going over stuff we'd already gone over with AT LEAST one other person.  So, we were done at about 11, then we did the 15 passenger van "test" (which consisted of driving around Hanes Park with a supervising RC) and we were done for the day.  Well, I guess some people had to come back, but Colleen, mine & Melissa's supervisor, was out sick.  How convenient, so I   STILL    don't know my schedule.  I did find out, however, that I will know my whole July schedule by the end of June.  That's cool.  And, I also found out that they do their best to let you off for weddings or other big family things like that that have been planned well in advance.  Rock on.  So, I might still be able to go to my cousin's wedding in NY in September.  Sko!  Guess that's about it. Time to figure out something to have for dinner that doesn't require too much effort.  I hate cooking for just me!

      Supposedly, I'm to find out my work schedule on Monday.  Becca talked to our supervisor Friday, I guess it was, and she called me and left a message saying that we'd all be meeting on Monday am to go over that.  And that we'd have time to sit down and work it out.  So I guess they don't have me set in stone yet, which could be a good thing.  =)  Rah.  I also have to get up super early to get my butt to the doctor to have a physical.  I was too tired on Friday to go do it then, so now I have to get up at the arse crack of dawn.  Ah well.  SO, now I must attempt to get myself to bed.  I hate going to bed early!!!

      Well my goodness.  It's been a while since I've done a "real" update.   So, as you know, I survived my crazy week of camp and work.    First, I'll tell you about camp. It was quite different this year, with the new director.  She didn't plan nearly as much "stuff" for the kids: education time, off 'campus' stuff (bowling, rollerskating, movies), or organized physical activity time.  So, this meant we had a LOT of free time with the kids, which is not good for the younger ones.  They all want to do something different, and it's hard to keep them all interested in the same things. My cabin, thank goodness, was quite satisfied with playing Red Rover and volleyball or "dodgeball" most of the time.  Next year, there definitely needs to be some organized PE type events.  It's hard to play anything with just 10-12 kids.  We need everyone to play a real game of dodgeball, ya know?  And, for craft time, we worked on basically the same thing all week.  Most kids finished their craft (a wooden flower box) the first or second day.  SO, thankfully they came up with a few other options.   I had the 7-9 kiddos, most of which were all "new".  Most of the kiddos I've been with the last few summers have moved up to cabin 3.  They're all getting so old!  I might have to go to cabin 3 next year too so I can stay with the same group.  But, we had a very good cabin this year.  They were all very well behaved, a little loud at times, but they listened well.    The first day, we had water games, which was no good considering that was the coldest day of the week.  I wish I had remembered to take my camera with me that day, because I was the designated pump holder for the first part of it, while the kids were in the kiddie pool.  I had 2 around my neck, on the little pump belts, and 2 more (plus mine) clipped to my shorts.  It was funny.  Then, I decided I was no longer a safe, dry holder, so I took them all off.  Then, it was time to soak the counselors. The kids had super soakers, and got ahold of the hose a few times.  So, as if I wasn't wet enough from that, 2 of the guy counselors decided it would be funny to pick me up and toss me in the kiddie pool.  Thank goodness I had taken off my phone and pump by that point.  So, I was dripping, sopping wet for the rest of the afternoon.  Ooh, isn't that fun?  Of course it was.  =)  I had a change of clothes, so it was ok.  The others that got that wet, weren't as smart as me!!  heheh.  I forget what we did on Tuesday, I think the Forsyth County EMT people came with the ambulance.  We got to get in it and see, kinda fun.  We had some girl, just graduated from HS come talk to the kids about diabetes (she's had it a whopping 3 years!)  That was kind of dumb. I forget what else.. Wednesday it POURED.  There was a couple inches of water in the parking lot.  It was nasty. Luckily, it was close to going home time, so we didn't have to entertan the kids for too long inside.  I unearthed my "Body art crayons" that I think KM or E got me for some birthday.  So I took those with me Thursday, and we did tattoos for a lot of our free time.  And, of course, signed shirts and stuff.  So I have yet another camp Enscore T-shirt with kid writing on it. lol.  That's really about it.  It was kinda boring this year, in terms of what we did.  The kids kept us busy, of course.  OH, I almost forgot!  Also on Thursday, we had those big inflatable slides and obstacle courses.  That was a trip!  I ran thru the bouncy obstacle course about 30 times, I bet.  And I got "brush burns" on my knees, feet and elbows from sliding on the slide parts.  But, they were really fun!  I had to leave early Thursday night, so I didn't get to see the "talent" show or the awards part to see how that went.. we'll see what next year brings.  Maybe I can help plan and get some more structure to it.. =)  I tell ya, one summer, I'm going to find a camp that goes more than a week and do that all summer!  There is this new camp that opened up in Randleman, I think it is, for chronically ill kids.  It's associated with Richard and Kyle Petty.  Dorothy told me about it before she left Baptist, but I forgot to check into it.  Maybe next year.. gotta get this internship done so I can get my degree.   Next:  work.  The first night I was there, I got to see a restraint first hand.  one of the girls pitched a fit and was coming after other people, so they had to chase her down, restrain her, hold her on the ground.  It was an event, let me tell ya. I was there until almost 11, supposed to have left at 9.  Talk about a long ass day.  The rest of the week was much calmer.  I don't know what else to say.  It wasn't too bad, I think I'll like it.  On my first real shift Friday night, we took them to the $3 movies and to Wal Mart, that was an ordeal.  First they had to all get gussied up to go out, then they had the radio BLASTING in the car (R&B/rap crap) and then had to be on the lookout for guys.  I tell ya. Thank god I didn't have to drive, I wouldn't have been able to handle it.  I can already tell there will be arguments when I do have to drive them somewhere.. I can not drive with that music that loud.   But, I think they're getting used to me well enough.  Of course, next week I'll be in the other girls cottage, so it'll be all "new" again.  But, at least I know them.  I've not gotten to work with Becca or Melissa at all this week, which sucks. I'll see them both at least once next week, I think, for team meeting. Melissa is off to Nashville this weekend, I'm jealous.  I want to go visit!  That's about all for now, I must go to bed.  It's been a long day of lounging by the pool.  :-P  I'm off till Tuesday at 3, so I'm excited.  Tomorrow I'm hopefully gonna get to Pier 1 to get a Pampasan chair. Hailey's family sent me a $75 gift card for there, and the chair is on sale for $100, so I need to get it soon!  I don't knw where I'll put it, but ever since I slept in Amy's I've wanted one.  I should have just bought hers from her when she was selling it!  Ah well.   I've got some pics of camp to put up on webshots soon.. gotta get out the scanner first though.

      But in a good way.  =)  Camp was fabulous, as usual.  Even with the glitches with the new director.  The Children's Home has been interesting, to say the least.  But, I'm too tired and sore to sit here and tell you all about it right now.  I've beenn doing camp 8-4, then working 6-"9".  So, it's been a long week.  I work Friday 3-11, then I'm off for 3 days, so I'll update then.  But, I'm alive; I survived.

      Wheeeeeeeee!  Tomorrow is the first day of camp!!  Happy day!!!  I went and helped set up today, and I think I know maybe 2 of the kids in my cabin.  All my kids have moved on to the next oldest cabin.  How sad!  =(  I'm so old!   That's all I have time for, I must get to bed NOW!

      FYI: Shrek 2 is just as funny the second time around.  I went and saw it with my mommy tonight.  She laughed hysterically.  If you   STILL    haven't seen it, you'd better get your butt to a theater!! =)  On another subject- I'm sick of rainy & overcast days!  ARGH. Where the heck is the summer weather?  I want it hot and sunny and perfect for the pool.  I'm sure it'll be like that all this week, while I'm at work.  growl grumble.   Uh.. anything else to report?  OH!  Exciting.  I got a $175 check from my apartment complex in TN.  I'm not really sure what it was for.  It seems that my pet deposit was only $99.. I can't remember that far back.  I'm pretty sure both of my deposits were on special. I know I wasn't getting any of the security deposit back, because I broke my lease.  But, oh well.  I'll take it!  =)   Now, since I've done sooo much today (sarcasm), I must go to bed, cuz I'm sleeeeeeepy.  Back to the working world tomorrow.  Blargh.

      Well goodness, I've become a slack ass!!  =)   Busy busy busy Nicole.  I'm not liking this working till 11 every night.  It is not cool.  Cuz, me being me, I sleep till 11ish every morning, get up, walk the dogs and go to the Y, and then it's just about time for work again!  What's that about?  Ah well. I did finally get my whole July schedule.  I'm covering for Becca for a "week" and another "week" for someone else on first shift.  Ugh.  6am is not my friend.  I say "week" because it's only 4 days, but it's still 40 hours.  Rah.   What else?  Oh, 4th of July we had the kids and their dad from Charlotte up here.  My sister is in NY for a few weeks, and his daughter from a previous marriage is here too, so it was a full house.  My brother & family from Kernersville were here too.  I had to work till 4 on the 3rd, but I got to take part in the cooking out part of the day.  They all left around 2 on the actual holiday, but it was nice enough that we got some swim time in before they had to go.  YAY!  Then, it was nice all 3 days I had off, so I parked my butt by the pool every day.  =)  Perfection.  It's finally been in the 90's with no rain, it's really summer!!  And, it's not been super humid, so being outside isn't too bad.   Work:  last week I was in the level 2 cottage with the girls.  I had a lot of fun with them.  Much more so than the level 3's.  I just connected more.  I guess because they are more mature.  BUt, we did lots of fun things: crafts, trips off campus, swimming, bike riding.  Which reminds me, I need to dig out my bike and see if it's in working order.  They don't have too many here that are in great condidtion, and the ones I ended up riding were sketchy.   This week, I'm back in level 3, with Becca.  Sometime last week, she pulled me into the office and told me that at least one of the girls had a beef with me wearing "inappropriate clothing".  What she got out of it was that they were jealous that I could wear the same things they did and not look skeezy in it.  Because I'm "too cute" and taking their attention, or something.  Whatever.  I already knew one of them didn't like me, she made some comment when Melissa and I were shadowing about "oh great, 2 more cute white girls to work here".  But, whatever, it's not a big deal.  They don't have to like me, they just have to listen.  But, I still haven't developed any connections with one of the girls.  Lately, she has talked to me more, but nothing deep or meaningful.  Ah well.  I've had some good interactions with 2 of the girls, so I'm somewhat satisfied.  There is some shit going down between staff, with inconsistencies.. so we'll see how that turns out.  I have the next 5 days off or on-call.  So, I hope no one gets sick or anything.  Especially not in either of the boys cottages.  Yipes!  Surely there has to be something else to talk about. OH!  Melissa and I went out Monday night, to Fox & The Hound, and played 2 free games of pool cuz the waiter dude thought we were cute.  He however, didn't think we were cute enough to give us free shots!  We had a Royal Flush shot, I think it was called, mmmmm.  I can't remember what was in it though.  Then, WEdnesday night after work, Melissa & some other work people and I went to Burke Street Pub for "Ladies night" which meant $2 Cosmos and Bay Breezes.  The cosmos were good, the bay breezes, not so much.  We played some more pool there too.  There wasn't much of a crowd tho.  THe girls we went with typically go on Thursday nights, and said it's a totally different place then.  I was too tired to even think about going out another night.  And, next week, I work at 6am on Friday, so I won't be able to go then either.  sonsofbitches.  But, we need to find some funner places to go out.. to dance!  I had too much fun in Vegas when we did that.   Ok, time for me to hit the road.  LATA!

      Ooooh, hurray for blogger for adding new text tools to their site!&nbsp; Now I can do colors, different sizes, and MORE!&nbsp; I'm sure I could have done this before, I just didn't know how.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Let's give it a try.  &nbsp;  Pink, how about that?&nbsp; I'm at work, and it's incredibly early.&nbsp; I went to bed before 10pm last night, and still did not want to get up at 6am.&nbsp; I'm just not an early morning person, that's all there is to it.&nbsp; I have a feeling I'm going to have to be doing this shift a lot, once Becca heads off to London. =(&nbsp; Unless someone is waiting to jump at the chance to do it, which I've not heard of.&nbsp; But, who knows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it uses up my evenings, I must prefer second shift.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  So what else?&nbsp; I am very much missing Clarksville/Nashville lately.&nbsp; I don't know what in particular, I guess just my own little world there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the cheap vet!&nbsp; It's like 3 times as expensive here to get shots and stuff for the dogs.&nbsp; Well, at least at Old Town.&nbsp; I need to check into some other places and see if it's cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, I miss my nice, calm, Clarksville Wal-Mart.&nbsp; Both of the ones here are just sketchy at times, and there are always too many people.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't exactly want to move back there, because I love being this close to parents and babysitting people and friends, but something keeps pulling at me.&nbsp; Melissa keeps trying to talk me into moving back to Nashville with her.&nbsp; She wants to go back and work at Youth Villages (I talked to the branch in Clarksville at one point, for doing an internship), and live in a house together.&nbsp; It's fun to think about, but it's just too far from home still.&nbsp; :-/&nbsp; Hmmm..&nbsp; Maybe I should try Knoxville.. halfway between the 2 places.&nbsp; LOL.     &nbsp;  Anyway...&nbsp; I think I'm taking a trip to PA in the middle of August.&nbsp; Southwest has $40 flights again, so off I go.&nbsp; I just have to get it approved in time to get the tickets!!&nbsp; Which reminds me.. I need to turn in my time off request.&nbsp; Rah!    &nbsp;  Amy wants me to go to the American Idol concert with her and Bill and Bill's little sister.. I'm all about it, BUT, they got $115 tickets!!&nbsp; HOly poo, that's waaaaaay more than even *NSYNC, what's that about?&nbsp; I'd love to go see the show, I think it'd be pretty good, but not sure if it's worth that much?!&nbsp; I also might go see Hillary Duff, with 2 of the girls that I babysit..&nbsp; she's gonna be in Clt on one of their birthdays, and I told their mom I'd take them if she didn't want to go.&nbsp; Hey, free concert?&nbsp; Count me in.&nbsp; I still want to go see BNL in Raleigh, but I'm not sure if that'll happen or not... Becca is going to the beach sometime the first few days of Aug, and wants me to go, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get off, and if I do, that'll cut into my vacation time for visiting PA.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is relevant because I think the BNL concert is early August as well.)

      Ugh, I'm not a happy Nicole right now.&nbsp; People messing with my schedule pisses me off!!!&nbsp; Yesterday, I was supposed to work 6am-4pm.&nbsp; Not happy with the morning part, but fine, whatever.&nbsp; I got up and was getting into the swing of things finally.&nbsp; Then one of the supervisors calls and says, "We need you to go home and come back at 4:30 this afternoon, someone called in sick for the 2p-12a shift."&nbsp; (At this point it was 9am already).&nbsp; UGH!&nbsp; So, I went home, but since I was already awake,&nbsp; I wasn't able to go back to bed, I just dozed for about 2 hours before I gave up and went to the gym and putzed around for the rest of the afternoon.&nbsp; SO, I was a walking zombie all night, and had a horrible headache all day.&nbsp; THEN, when they call to tell me the change in plans, they also change my today (Friday) schedule to 10a-6p, so I don't have to work till midnight, and be back at the crack of dawn.&nbsp; Well, later on in the day when I came back to work, Colleen tells me that because one of the girls has a court appt in Stokes County and because she will be away at training all day, I have to come in at 8am, and still stay till 6pm.&nbsp; Ut uh, not going to happen.&nbsp; If I was only going to stay till 4pm anyway, what's the point in me staying till 6.&nbsp; I don't give a rats ass if I work my 10 hours or not.&nbsp; So, I'm leaving today at 4 no matter what.&nbsp; I'm going to tell them I've got an appt at 4:30 to get to, that I made a while back, and just forgot about yesterday.&nbsp; Kiss my ass.&nbsp; I hate being screwed over and expecting to be able to adapt my schedule to fit everyone else's at the last minute.&nbsp; I understand people get sick, but freakin' A, have a better back up plan for it.&nbsp; Hello, is that not what on call people are for?&nbsp; I'm poopey, sleepy and I do not want to be here to deal with stupid ornery kids who will argue when you tell them the sky is blue.&nbsp; Ugh, and I still have to do early shifts Saturday &amp; Sunday.&nbsp; BITE ME!!!

      Hurray!!  I finally saw Spiderman 2!!  (From the 3rd row..  because even 2 weeks after it opened the theater was still packed)  It was awesome!   I didn't have to work yesterday, no one called in sick, wa hoo!  Melissa and I spent the afternoon by the pool.  Hot damn.  And, had a nummy dinner of pork chops too (at mom & dad's).  It was faboo.  Then, I babysat about 8 kids under age 9.  It was CRAZY.  I was at my girlies' house, but their parents were having a dinner party, so everyone brought their kids.  They did my nails and hair and "make up",  big fun!  lol.  There was a itty bitty baby, a few weeks old, I think, that I was supposed to be paying the most attention too, but hte other mom's kept her occupied.  Ah well, an east $30!    I'm on call again tomorrow, blargh.  Hopefully it'll work out just like Saturday!    Ooooh, Robin might be coming to visit this week!  She's coming to Charlotte to pick up a new-used car.  (she's got family in Murphy, in the mountains, and one of them is a car guy, so he picked it our for her or something)  Anyway, she's going to try to come up and visit me on her travels through the state.  How cool is that?  I also want to try to go to Booooone and see Susan & some KKPsi peoples.  We'll see.  I'm off on Wednesday, but we have staff meeting at 9am, and I have to meet with my internship person after.  Blargh. I hate that, you have the day off, but still have to come in.  Suck.   Guess that's about it.  Time to get to bed, just in case I get called in bright and early tomorrow am.

        Ahh, I love having a day of nothingness.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; It's so nice to not have to work for an entire weekend.&nbsp; Well, actually, I'm on call Sunday, so there is a chance I'll have to work.   I slept until 1:30pm&nbsp;today!! Holy poo!&nbsp; I must have seriously needed sleep!&nbsp; I took the dogs out at about 8am and then went back to bed.&nbsp; Melody woke me up several times in between 8 and 1:30, but I just ignored her and she went back to sleep.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; Then, I got up, cleaned up dishes and bottles and stuff from last night, and went to the Y.&nbsp; That's it.. nothing else.&nbsp; I didn't even make it to the pool today.&nbsp; Now, I'm babysitting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perfection.   SO, yesterday Amy & I were going to spend the entire afternoon at the pool.&nbsp; Well, she got delayed in her departure from Kernersville, and then got lost for about an hour.&nbsp; So, she got there around 3:30, and Melissa and I had to leave a little after 4 to go to a closure party at TCH for one of the girls that is leaving next week.&nbsp; But, we still had time to have some "stuff" with a little extra in it, and ice cold Smirnoff Ices.&nbsp; mmm.&nbsp; So, Melissa and I were a little goofy.&nbsp; We stayed at the party for about an hour (it was a pool party, so we still got to swim and be in the sun!)&nbsp; Then, we got back, got to see Zack & his "little" sister for a bit and then headed back to my place to cook dinner and be silly.&nbsp; It was a blast.&nbsp; I must say again, that Amy & Bill are so much fun to hang out with!!&nbsp; I just need to get Bill to introduce me to some of his single friends.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; Or Amy too, for that matter!   So, I'm going to shell out the mula to go see American Idol with Amy &&nbsp;Bill.. they somehow got 14th row seats!&nbsp; Awesome, that's right where E & I were for NSYNC.&nbsp; Too cool.&nbsp; It'll be fun, even tho I have to work at 6am the next day!&nbsp; Zut.&nbsp; Speaking of.. I'm a busy bee in August.&nbsp; Lots of vacations, and there are a good handful of people that are leaving.&nbsp; Becca & another girl from Oxford, 1-2 from the other girls cottage, and don't know about the boys side.&nbsp; So, it is possible that I might be able to get a permanent shift!!&nbsp; Altho, Becca & one of the other people are both first shift weekends, which I could not deal with.&nbsp; THe other one is 3-11 Tues-Friday, and 8-4 on Saturday.&nbsp; I might be ok with that.. we'll see.&nbsp; It's kind of nice to change it up now and then though.   What else?&nbsp; There is really NOTHING exciting going on in my world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the wackos at work, I've not met any fun new boys, which sucks.&nbsp; Even with as much as I've been out and about with Melissa.&nbsp; And, speaking of her, she might be leaving me too, to go back to Nashville!&nbsp; Noooooooo!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get ahold of Amanda and make her make time to hang with me.&nbsp; Maybe she can incorporate me into her circle of friends.&nbsp; We shall see, we shall see.&nbsp;   Trying to make a trip to Boone, to see Susan and maybe some KKPsi peeps.&nbsp; I'm waiting to find out if Becca can go with me next week.. so that'll be fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course I'm going to&nbsp;PA to visit with Katherine, Lauren & E.&nbsp; (hurray $96 flight!!)&nbsp; I've got 3 more days off together in later August that I might try to scoot over to Nashville/Clarksville to visit too.&nbsp; I need to check into some flights or see if I really want to drive.&nbsp; It might not be so bad if I went to Robin's first, then to Clarksville the next day.&nbsp; If I fly, I won't have a car, which'll SUCK.&nbsp; Unless I can find one that'll rent to an almost 25 year old.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Hmm... I spose that's enough for now.

        My new saying... I can't stop saying it.&nbsp; lol.      &nbsp;  May I just say.. I love hanging out with Amy (& Bill too).&nbsp; We swummed today, and had dinner and were just silly.&nbsp; I'm so glad she's in NC now, and staying too!!&nbsp; Zack came for a bit of a swum, with his "little" sister, Amanda, who is not so little any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Becca and Melissa (from work) were here too.&nbsp; We cooked some nummy chicken enchilada thingy (with a mix from a box) which was FABULOUS!&nbsp; Then mad fun drinks, did some karoake with Amy's fun machine, and then, of course, ended up at TGIFridays for Oreo Maddness, mmmmmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the short recap.&nbsp; I have more to update you on, but I need to put myself into bed.. I'm about to zonk out!!&nbsp; But, I just wanted you to know I'm still alive!!

       Hot dog!!&nbsp; My first shift stint is over!!&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; It wasn't super awful, once I got out of bed and moving, but I don't think I could do it for a long period of time.&nbsp; It's no fun having to go to bed by 10pm on the weekends!!&nbsp; So most of the "week" (4 days=40 hours) was uneventful.&nbsp; A few little flare ups by some of the girls, but nothing horrible.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to take 2 of them off campus all by myself Saturday, that was fun....&nbsp;&nbsp;that's about it in terms of work. OH!&nbsp; I got to go to a treatment team meeting Friday for one of the kids.&nbsp; That was a neat experience.&nbsp; I want to go to more of them.&nbsp; Which reminds me, I need to email the clinical/case manager people and see if I can sit in or observe behind the mirror some family therapy sessions.&nbsp; *note to self!*    &nbsp;  I'm off tomorrow, and I plan on sleeping in super late.&nbsp; Of course, I say that, and I'll probably be ready to get up at 9am.&nbsp; Ah well.&nbsp; A whole day of nothing, and I don't really even have any errands to run either.&nbsp; I'm going to see my newhpew play T ball or something at 5, but that's it. Tuesday I get to go to the back cracker, rah!&nbsp; And then work 3-11 in the boys cottage, SCARY!&nbsp; They've had some issues down there lately, so I'm a bit nervous.&nbsp; I have to get working on some paperwork, my professional development plan.. I have to type out all my goals and strengths and weaknesses, etc.&nbsp; I also have to get caught up on weekly notes for my internship, to mail to my advisor.&nbsp; Rock on.     &nbsp;  Ummmm... what else?&nbsp; OH!&nbsp; Amy B and I got to hang out the other night.. we went to a cute little italian deli place in Kernersville, and then to the movie theater there, which has current movies for $3!&nbsp; DUDE!&nbsp; AND, the drinks/popcorn/candy are really cheap too.&nbsp; I got a jumbo diet coke for $2.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; We saw "The Terminal", with Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones.&nbsp; It was pretty cute.&nbsp; I wasn't too happy with the ending, but overall it was fun.&nbsp; Now I want to see Anchorman, A Cinderella Story and Farenheit 911.&nbsp; Perhaps I can do that this coming week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep thinking it's Friday, not Sunday, being that I've been working straight for 4 days.&nbsp; I'm all discombobulated!    &nbsp;  Ok, I need to go do some laundry and perhaps go running with Melly. &nbsp;

      Hmm.. I was just going through old posts and stuff, and noticed that the frequency of my posts has decreased significantly since I've moved home.  Could this be due to the fact that W-S is less exciting than Nashville?  Or maybe it has a little to do with the fact I'm working 40 hours a week.  ;-)   I need to get a city guide or something.  I never know what to do, besides shopping or chatting at TGIFridays.  ?!  There was Riverwalk in both Clarksville and Nashville... along with lots of parks and fun downtowns to meander through.  perhaps one day I should meander through downtown W-S, taking care to stay out of the "ghetto"!!  LOL.  Anyone got any suggestions?  We have this problem at work too, trying to find free things to do with the kids.  Dum de dum....  I'm SO excited about this trip to PA!!  I talked to Katherine about it last night, about the crazyness that is "hayfest" and it sounds like a trip.  Not to mention the drunkedness!  It's always fun to watch people you don't know "act-a-fool"!   And, she says Hay has at least one cute, single friend!  ;-)  heheh.  So, if she has to work, they can entertain me!  OH!  AND Katherine talked to Terri Terri Terri (her roomie from App) and there is  a chance, all be it slim to none, that she might hop on a plane and come visit while I'm there too!!  That would be the coolest of cool.  Terri, if you happen to read this, get your ass on a plane and come visit!!  We miss you!  I told KM that if she doesn't come, we are going to kidnap her and Amanda and go to Boone for a football weekend!  Just like old times.  Anyway, I'm going to skoot to bed.  I went out to dinner with Melissa and her mommy tonight; we had Thai.  I tried something new!!!  It was pretty nummy.  I had Thai fried rice & chicken, which is NOTHING like chinese fried rice.  I forget what they had, but both dishes were nummy.  Then we went to Maggie Moos for ice cream.. num!!  My headache has gone away for the most part, but I still feel sort of sluggish.  For a while, every time I got up or sat up from laying down I was all lightheaded and "foggy".  I am better now that I've eaten a meal.. so maybe that's had something to do with it.  Altho I had Chesapeake Bagel this am while my car was being inspected.   Who knows.  I'm sure it's stress/tension, and I need a massage.  Maybe I'll just have to splurge and pay the outrageous price for one.  Right. so I'm really going to bed now!!

      Ugh.  My head has been hurting for almost 24 hours now.   Freakin' pain in the ass, obnoxious, good for nothing clients at work.  Yes, they have sucky home situations, but they've got it pretty good while they're at The Children's Home.. and they think we're so mean and disrespectful to them, making their lives a living hell, treating them like they're in jail.  What the HELL ever.  They can't even imagine what we could make their lives like if we treated them the way they treat us.  Little shits.  Ok, enough of that rant.  Last night was the worst night of work I've had yet.  We called the W-S PD twice.  The head officer on the last call tried everything she could to take at least one of them away.  One of the girls had "attacked" another staff with the phone, leaving a nice bruise.  They all ran away once, 2 of them 3 more times after that.  In the afternoon they had a pow wow in the middle of the floor with pots, pans, metal cooking bowls and big metal kitchen utensils banging and yelling, almost like they were doing some sort of tribal ritual.  They were acting like 2 year olds not getting their way.  The funny part about it: Becca and I were locked in the med room when this all started, so we started drumming on the walls and desk in there.  That stopped them for a few minutes.  LOL.   And, last night I guess shit hit the fan too.. cuz the cops had been out last night too. 2 of the girls almost or did get in a fight.  Jeez-a-peez.  This is not what I went to school for 2 years for!!  It's freakin' glorified babysitting.  I'd rather go back and take care of those 2 rotten boys I babysat for a few years ago; and that's saying a whole lot.   Kamille, the other staff last night, was already talking about calling in sick.  We were both at our wits end.  So, I called in today too!  I was supposed to be on call.  Hell if I'm working for 6 days straight with those brats.  They're all on level 1, with hardly any priviledges for the next week plus.  Which is going to make it hell from now until then.  Lord.  300 more hours, and as soon as I've met my internship requirements, I'm OUTTA THERE!!   Now, I still have the remnants of a headache, and I feel as though I could puke at any point.  I'm not sure if the headache and stomach ache are connected or not.  I bought some excederin (sp?) but even that didn't seem to help.  This is not going to be fun if I have a constant headache all the time that I'm working. No good, and not worth it.  I'm actually going to start searching for other places to work around here now, so I can have something lined up for January-ish.  So, that's my rant.  Now I'm going to go see if swimming will make me feel any better. I need a massage, where's Lori when you need her?!  ;-)

      We took Jezzy to the doggie neurologist this am, over in Gso, and found out after a $1500 catscan, that she has 2 ruptured discs in her neck.&nbsp; They could do surgery, but I guess it's one of those things that could or could not work.&nbsp; Not to mention that it'll cost $2500-3000 more dollars.&nbsp; So... they gave her more pain meds and said to keep her quiet for a few more weeks and it could heal on it's own.&nbsp; We have no idea how she did it.. it just happened one day.&nbsp; Poor thing.&nbsp; My mommy is very upset, which is no good.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, say a little doggy prayer for her that she'll heal herself.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'm afraid of what we'll have to do.   In other news.. Tucker is going to be my flying buddy and fly to PA with me!!&nbsp; Hot damn!&nbsp; I'm so excited.&nbsp; I've never flown with a friend before! It'll be too much fun! =)&nbsp; And, we get to go to "Hayfest" with Hay's family and have some crazy good times!!&nbsp; I'm excited.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Then, perhaps the week after that, I might go to TN to visit, since I have another random 3 days off of work.   Work... ugh.&nbsp; I'm sick of it already.&nbsp; I usually don't mind it once I'm there and into the swing of things, but ugh.&nbsp; It's glorified babysitting, with maybe 10 mins of counseling thrown in every now and then.&nbsp; It's not something I want to do longer than I have to.&nbsp; Hopefully, they'll have some openings in day treatment or clinical stuff when my internship ends, so I can move into that.&nbsp; I don't like this wacky shift stuff either.&nbsp; Even if I took one of the many shifts opening up due to people leaving, it'd still be dumb hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; blargh.&nbsp;   Don't know what else.. I had another purpose in opening up this post, but I've forgotten it.&nbsp; Hm.

      Hmph.  Tom Cavanaugh, the guy who played Ed on the show "Ed", just got married to someone who isn't me!!  I'm not amused.  It's bad enough that I can no longer watch him on Ed, because NBC cancelled it mid season last spring, now I have to deal with him getting married?  Harumph.  He's obviously confused, and will regret his decision when he finally meets me.  ;-)

      Hot-doggie!  I'm done with 6ams for a while.  Well, at least for 10 days.  Thank goodness.  I'm so exhausted.   I've been in bed by 10 at the very latest all week, which seems to leave me hardly any time to do anything.  I'm going to sleep until noon tomorrow, and do absolutely nothing but go soak up some sun at the pool.  Assuming the weather cooperates...  Yesterday we had the trouble maker committed to the hospital.  So, it's been a lot calmer.  She's there for 4 days minimum, and hopefully they'll fix her meds and get her stable.   None of us can take anymore of the behaviors of last week.  um... not much else.  It's been all work lately.  BORING!
