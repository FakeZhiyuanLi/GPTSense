      Fuck me am I beat to shit. Today was suppose to be my day off but 9 am rolls around and guess who calls? No not my dream girl...goddamn supervisor calling me in for a 8.5 hours shift. So i stumble up there and get to work. A few hours later I find out this little doofus Tristan isn't showing up. So me being infinitely wise I volunteer to work overtime. I figure it's good money so why not? By 8:30 I'm beat to shit and decide to peace. But alas my parents aren't home so I have to drag my ass down home. Good god I can barely see I'm so tired.  What else has happened?....Yeah not a thing. Just wanted to bitch. Gonna fall asleep to the sweet melodies that are Deathcab for Cutie.  Adios

      Dunno why I'm here. I really have nothing much to say I'm just uber bored due to the 3 day hiatus on gas pumping due to lack of scheduling. I think I'm gonna trim my nose hairs then go for a jog. I must see Napoleon Dynamite. A friend sent me the dance scene and I cried I laughed so hard. I'm doing it for the next dance show hands down.  I'm in  a better mood today. Dunno what was wrong with me last night. Maybe it'll kick back in tonight and I'll figure it out.  I'm watching Newlyweds season 2 right now. Jessica my oh my. How can something so hot be so stupid? Ok yeah easily I know I know.  I've decided I don't need a girlfriend I just need to get laid. I've got alot of pent uo sexual frustration. Need to let off some steam. Not saying I you know...would be rough or something like that...wow am I sounding like a creep here. CHANGE OF SUBJECT!!  I started listening to some of Johnny Cash's old stuff. Quality shit. Anyone who thinks they know everything about him because they've heard "hurt", you don't know shit. I'm getting tired of all these little 15 and 16 year old girls saying they love him and bands like  Zepplin and shit like that cause they're trying to be trendy. I went to Market Mall yesterday. UGH. So many wannabe trendy crap ass stores. All you see is what Cosmo says is cool these days. Even that "Play" is shit. trying to pretend they're indy but the second you step in the first album I saw was Jojo. I'm not saying I'm some indy freak. Just saying mainstream and indy are two completely different worlds and it's lame that they're trying to mesh them. Why can't people just be themselfs and stop having to be told what's cool or not. Gah lame.  Hey I bought Godsend yesterday. About to watch it. Looks scary as shit. Send in the clones oui?

      I'm in a very strange mood tonight. I worked til 11 and had to walk home. All the way I listened to Dashboard Confessionals and it's made me very depressed. I just don't want things to change. I like how everything was during the school year. Even the bad stuff. At least I knew I had time to fix things. Now it feels like there's this huge weight pressing down and no way or time to change it. I just feel like I should have done more or resolved things more...resolutely. This summer has been an overall let down and for things to come to a close so abruptly and depressingly sucks. I just want to scream and let it all out but I'm scared I'll never be able to stop. I know that sounds lame but it's the only way I can say it. Fuck it's too late for this. I need some time to think things through. Tomorrow is another day after all.

      Wow and now for something completely different. so I was originally suppose to head down to Kensington with my dearest friend Kirsten for a day of jugo juice and boy watching (for her not me I swear). She has to cancel but I end up heading down anyhoo. So I'm wandering around looking for something productive to do and out of no where my friend Julia appears. We get to talking and she introduces me to her friend Sara I think her name was. We end up spending the better part of the afternoon together which was a blast. I head home and am not in the door more than 10 minutes when I get an invite from the one and only Vanya to come hang out with her and Christine. So I head 'er over. The night started off normally. The usual snide remarks from the duo about me being a closet gay and then them grabbing each others ass and randomly spooning each other. We head to Vanya's and hang out there. On the way I saw my dear friend Janine (I have way to many friends who are girls. Time for an infusion of testosterone and sex...With women) Anyhoo it was the stereotypical night of a regular group of kids. Which is the exact opposite of my usual night (ie sit at home and say hello to miss Palmela Handerson). On the way home we listened to Deathcab which is one of my all time favorite albums. There is something extremely surreal when you sing the lyrics "She is beautiful but she doesn't mean a thing to me" right next to the girl whom until the very recent past I was coocoo over. Whatever. Probably never gonna see either of them ever again. Which is quite depressing actually to think that that might be my last memory of either of them. I've said it before but I'll say it again if you're reading this either of you. Have a goddam good life. You deserve nothing short of that.  *Heavy sigh* Goddam tired.  Found out my uncle whom I haven't seen in over 3 years (Dad's brother see Superfreak for an extremely abbreviated version of that story) is dying which is strangely depressing. The man was an asshole to me even when I was still seeing my father so why should I care? Fuck death is so depressing.  Whatever nothing much else to report. G'night  Oh I started a nexus account. I'm jumbojimbo for anyone who wants to add me. It's still shit I'm gonna spend all day tomorrow editing it.

      So today was a day off work. I sat on my ass most of the day and watched "Boys n the hood". Gotta be on of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Just mind blowing how powerful it is. I was planning on going to this play at Olympic plaza with that girl. At the last minute she calls and says she doesn't have the car so she doesn't want to do anything tonight. Whatever. I decide to go down and meet the people we were going to see it with alone. I can't find them anywhere so I end up sitting in between the two people who encompass every stereotype me and a close ami hate about theater folk (I finally mentioned you in here Kirsten now...DANCE WITH ME). On my right was an old woman who wouldn't stop sniffing and sneezing through the whole show. On my left was a guy who laughed at all the wrong places (because of them funny accents) and wouldn't stop talking to what I believe was his wife/girlfriend/goat...UGH!! Bad day.  Came home and went for a run with my sister. Mother is being a C-rag (y'all know what that c stands for) as usual. Can't stand to be in the same room as her for more than a few minutes. She just randomly insults me for no apparent reason other than the fact that she is miserable and you know that saying... Yeah I actually can't quite recall it but whatever. Calls me weak and scrawny....Which I am in one regard but I could run circles around her fat ass... Bitch...Fuck it one more year left. Can't fucking wait. I'm putting serious thoughts into saving up and moving into some cheap apartment in Bowness during the year. It would be better than living here. Wow is that a depressing revelation.  I watched Kill Bill vol 2 again. So radical. Sam Jackson...Oh how I love thee. Even if you only had 4 lines. I wanna watch the Shaft remake now. Or maybe the new Star Wars...Or how about (duh) Pulp Fiction or (my personal favorite) Jackie Brown. All have much more Sam Jackson goodness. hhhmmm what else  Yeah it surprising how little has gone down these last few days. I went to a party last night. Got drunk then bored and stumbled home. A bunch of girls there told me I was the hottest guy there which was a definite ego booster. I've decided to myself this is gonna be the year of no regrets. Basically my whole life up until now has been a series of missed opportunities. I have enough regrets from the last 3 years alone to last a lifetime so I'm gonna try and not add any more this year. I don't really know where to start seeing as how my life is pretty much in shambles as of this writing. Whatever time for bed. Got an early start tomorrow (have to be at work by 11 am MY GOD) and so I shall depart and fall into dream world aided by the sweet melodic voice of one Bob Dylan.  You stay classy

      WOW it's amazing what a few hours can do to completely change your mood. So I was all bummed out today thinking about my dad and such as I headed to work. I get there and find out I'm already 10 minutes late for an orientation at the main branch (Breantwood). So me and my buddy Tyson (whom hadn't been told either god bless the managing staff) burn down there and get in just fine. The first half was boring shit (as is the first half of this blog HUZZAH) but when we got back from break it all went uphill. I was sitting beside this mondo hottie named Tannis (like tennis but with an a she says and I love her already due to the wicked ass name) and we start talking. Turns out she's pretty much the female version of me (but only slightly hotter ;) ) and we hit it off immediately. Many was there a time where we were chastised for talking by the speaker (who's sister happens to be one of my best friends girlfriends). Anyhoo the end of the orientation comes and I figured "Oh well here's where it ends" As usual right...BUT NO!! Out of the blue she slips me this piece of paper with her number on it and for me to call her tomorrow when I get off work. So now I'm sitting on cloud nine and don't think it can get any better. BUT IT DOES!!! She lives IN VARSITY FUCKIN' ACRES!! Which for those of you who don't know is the community adjacent to mine. Man oh man am I feelin good. Yeah that was my day...I'm gonna go listen to some Deathcab or maybe some Trews or maybe something completely unrelated to either...OR MAYBE ALL OF THE ABOVE I'MA CRAZY MAN!!!! Yeah I'm really not....you get the ideer. Anyhoo this is James signing off. You stay classy Blogger....

      Well the title of this blog has 2 meanings. First of all I just wanted to say RIP Rick James. Cocaine is a hell of a drug. I don't think enough people appreciate his contribution to music. Alright so maybe the Mary Jane girls weren't that great of a contribution but still....He will always be the man.  Secondly I guess it reffers to myself. Lately I've just been very off and I think it's because I've been trying to get stuff off my chest but won't because I'm trying to not piss people off. I've decided to stop pussy footing and to say what U want to. If it pisses someone off or offends them in any way they can go fuck themselves.  ...Funny thing is now I can't think of what to say or where to start....  Ok... I'll start with my father. I've been working up the courage to talk about him for awhile now and I guess might as well do it now. Where to begin. I guess I'll do it chronologically so I don't have to go off on tangents.  At age 6 My parents get divorced. My father moves into the house next to my grandparents which happens to also be the house my grandfather grew up in as a child. My dad lives there for 4 years. During this time he meets and impregnates another woman. He eventually moves in with her in a house in the same community as me. He claims it is to be closer to me and my older siblings but in truth I begin to see less and less of him. My step-mother out right says in front of me if she had her way I wouldn't even be in their lives. My half brother is born when I'm 10 and I'm immediately labeled the baby sitter as neither of his parents are willing to put any kind of effort into his upbringing duringthe school year. During summers they pretend they're the perfect parents, taking him to birthday parties and movies and always dragging me along so they can talk with their friends and I watch the kids. At 13 I steal $90 dollars from my step-mother. I am caught and forced to go to couciling with my father. It's all a sham and is provided free by the school board. She's not even a real coucilor but my father is utterly convinced that I am a basket case and could blow up at any minute due to my "cry for help". This coming from the man whole thousands of dollars from my mother and grandfather during the divorce. During that summer my father sets up a bank account for me that he will deposit i think it was 20 dollars a month to prevent me from stealing again. The catch is I have no access to this money. Only he can get to it. I ask him for the money and he blows. An argument ensues (of coarse) and I don't talk to him for the next month and a half. Eventually things are smoothed out and for Christmas I buy him some Yanni cd or something like that. Some new wave shit because he thinks he's sooo deep. A week before we get in to another argument and while he is out I take back the cd. On boxing day he finds out about this from my grandmother (who's probably clinically insane) who also tell him she paid for it. He flips out and says I'm stealing and yadda yadda. On top of this my step mother threatens to phone the police and say they were robbed due to my actions. I tell her to go fuck herself and my father kicks me out of the house. He says completely out of the blue that I was the cause of the divorce and that he's always happier when I'm not around. Since that night we have passed a few letter back and forth. Mostly me asking for my things back and him saying no. I've seen him once or twice and always he's been a cold hearted fucker. I realize I'm not completely innocent and he's not completely at fault. Ya just gotta meet the man and you'll understand. He's never shown the slightest bit of affection to me. I dunno. It's alot bigger than this little paragraph. It's 17 years of bullshit. How do you boil down every little event into this one space? There's a shitload more to it I just don't feel like typing nor do I even feel like telling. Somethings should remain personal. Actually upon re-reading this all these problems seem rather trivial to me. I dunno. Don't all think I'm some kind of pre-madonna who flips at the drop of a hat.  What more can I say about Vanya? I'm just throwing this one out there maybe it wasn't even about me but I'm assuming it was because i'm an overly paranoid freakazoid. I wasn't trying to be creepy and know everything about you or something like that. I just honestly happened upon you blog mcblooger thingy (whatever ya call these things) and didn't mean to offend you in any way by doing that. I wasn't trying to be creepy and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I realize I'm probably still coming off creepy cause I went back. In all honesty I don't know what to say here. I'm sorry if I upset you in any way, shape or form. That was the furthest thing from my intentions. In fact I didn't have any intentions when writting this stuff other than to get it off my chest. I didn't think you would ever read any of my entries nor did i honestly want you to. I realize telling Christine was probably the biggest mistake I could have made. No offence by the way Christine. Whatever I hope ya can forgive me for...whatever it is I did and just put all this weirdness behind us. If there even is any. Maybe i'm just being like I said overly paranoid. but then maybe I'm not. Bu then again, and i truly mean no offence to you in saying this, you are as everyone knows moving to Norway at the end of the month. Do you really think any of this bullshit is gonna matter over there? You probably won't even remember my name. That's not some kind of pessemistic comment towards myself. It's just what happens. Anyhoo I don't know if this really had any point I just thought if it needed throwing out there I'd do it. And if not HEY more weirdness oui?    I dunno what else to write about so I'm just gonna throw myself to the dogs and send this one out.

      Who the hell came up with the name for this thing? Blogger...The hell? Whatever. Wicked ass day at work. Barrels of premium oil for anyone who knows what that means ;)... What else.... I had McDonald's on my break and almost threw up after. Gotta break the habit and stop eating there. So gross.... Hey that reminds me I've been meaning to rent Grosse Point Blank for awhile now. Great movie if ya haven't seen it go rent it now... That is unless you're going to the Rogers by my house in which case wait til some other time. Beat Tony Hawk 4 before work...yeah I'm starting to realize why I be on the single side... I saw some friends of mine at McDicks and got invited to go partying sometime this week. Probably not gonna happen as usual but hey it's the thought that counts right? Heh I've been listening to the College dropout album by Kanye West as I typed this and a funny little interlude came on.  "Now beat that and your mother says go to college so you finish college and it's wonderful. You feel so good. And after al lteh partying and crazy and don't forget that drug habit you picked up at school hanging around your peers HEY now you'll get that 25 thou job a year and you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine. But it'll be your money. No more borrowing from mom or my hide. So now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it. If you continue to work at the Gap after several interviews (OH MY GOD!!) You'll come in at an entry level position. And when you do that if you kiss enough ass you'll move up to the next level. Which is being the secretary's secretary!!! And boy is that great. You get to take messages for the secretary who never went to college she's actually the bosses niece. So now you're part of the family. You know what college does for you? It makes you really smart man. All you kids wanting to talk at the back of the class NOT ME I listened ok I was a hall monitor this was meant to be. Do you know how many extra classes I took? Extra classes extra classes. NO I've never had sex but you know what my degrees keep me satisfied. When a lady walks up to me and says "Hey you know what's sexy?" I say "No I don't know what it is... but I bet I can count up all the change in your purse very fast."  It's funnier when ya hear it I'll admit. But it's still amusing.  Wow was that a waste of time. Isn't that the story of my life eh?  So now that I've wasted some more space and air I guess I shall depart and do what I do every night...Try to take over the world!!!! Or just you know....Go to sleep...

      I feel like being jessie today so I'm gonna write a really lame poem. Here goes  My heart is like fine China A beautiful thing to behold yet just as easily broken And once it has shattered it can never be repaired ....I want a fat bottom girl.... *Tear* Why does it sting when I pee....  Yeah there ya go. My best Jessie impersonation. Anyhoo...getting ready for work again. I loves me that vehicular orifice pumping. Uuummmm stayed up all night and read the Beach by Alex Garland again. Best book I've ever read. I'm dead tired now but whatever. I'll just drink a shitload of coffee and coke and such at work. Kill Bill vol 2 comes out today. I'm going after work to buy it. AND Alien vs Predator comes out this Friday. Could this week get any better? Well yeah absolutely but...you know... Yeah this has been pretty pointless I just felt like writing something.

      So today was my day off of work and I sat around on my ass watching movies. I went from the Last Samurai (Tom Cruise as the only samurai to survive is strangely depressing) to Dogma (Need i say more) all the way to Freddy vs Jason (You all know who won quitcher bitchin' Freddy's a pansy). Anyhoo... yeah what else. Listened to some Meatloaf... rocked my world.  Goddamn computer keeps crashing. there it goes again. fuck. back... okie dokie  I've had alot of time to think things through today and alot has become clear to me. I've decided to quit smoking and probably drinking after the summer all together. All it does is pollute my body and cloud my judgement and I sure as shit don't need that right now. I see all the people at work who smoke and they're going nowhere in life and that's not where I wanna be at this point.  I'm gonna take a step back and not be so hung up on being single. All things come in due time (teehee I made a double entendre). I don't need the bullshit of a girlfriend right now.  Everybody who's read my other posts and who know me really needs to take it down a notch on the whole Vanya front. Everybodies saying how I'm not over her and I shouldn't bug her and shit like that. All I have to say about that is this... I wrote all that to get it off my chest. I wasn't writing it for you, or her, or anyone else other than me. I had to get somethings off my conscience and this was the only way I knew how. I know how I feel about her and I know how she feels about me and I was fine with that. I wasn't going to say or do anything about it. She's going to fucking Norway in less then a month for fucks sake. What could I expect. Not fucking worth it for such a short time frame. She's a great person and I'd love to continue being friends with her long into the years and I don't want some goddamn teenage crush to get in the way of that.  I'm coming up on my last year of high school and am absolutely terrified. My marks are nearly good enough and I have no idea what I'm going to do. I've always dreamed of being an actor. Not a big huge movie star I've just loved performing for people and trying to make them happy. But now I'm starting to doubt that. My drama teacher has told me I'm capable but no one else seems to think so and, no offence Dean, but he's only a teacher and a great judge of ability *cough Elizabeth cough*. My step-dad is pressuring me inot being a cop. Why the fuck would I want to be one of those? He's utterly convinced he's going to brainwash me into becoming what he wanted to be if his life had gotten so fucked at such a young age.  Funny thing is I've been going through all kinds of shit these past few years and I don't it's really even hit me yet how much it's affected me. A normal person would be a fucking basket case if confronted with half the stuff I've experienced. I don't know what's wrong with me. When my dad kicked me out and did all his bit (someday I'll elaborate) not a tear was shed from my eyes. When my mom told me I was a mistake and she wished she had never had me... still nothing. I think I'm dead inside. I don't know what's wrong with me. I always think about what it's going to take for me to break. I've seen so much in such a short time that I can't even imagine what else life could throw at me. It just sucks that I have nothing to comfort me with. Most people turn to religion but I've never been one to take comfort in words written thousands of years ago that may or may not just be all bullshit. I don't want to dedicate my life to something that may just be the figment of some loonies imagination. Why is God real and Superman isn't? The only proof for either are written word and pictures... what's the difference? I don't know what I saying here. I'm really fucking confused right now. I just want to feel something different for once. I'm tired. Tired of all this. I just need something different.

      You know who I'm talking about here so I feel no need to use names. I posted earlier (I've since just outright deleted it) how I "adore" you and the usual mushy puppy love crap (why oh why won't she like me *barf*) and have come to the realization that it's all bullshit. It's not worth it. I can't keep thinking in the mind frame that we could be together, that we could be something we can never be. It's too much for too little. Why am I literally laying awake at 2 in the morning thinking about all the things I want to say to you when in fact it's all just hormones. I don't love you, how could I barely fucking know you and am never gonna get the chance go go anywhere beyond that. It's not even the age thing, if that was ever a factor. You're just not what I thought you were. When I met you I saw everything so differently. I can remember the first time I saw you. I thought you were the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. When you started talking to me it was merely icing on the cake. I could never see anything ever again and be happy forever with merely that image of you in my head. And for a time we were happy. Fuck me I'm making this bullshit into some kinda motherfuckin soap opera. AND NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED!! IT'S ALL IN MY FUCKING HEAD!! I honestly thought what I felt for you was love. I've never felt anything so strongly for another human being as I did for you. And somehow I managed to trick myself into thinking you might feel the same. I'd pretend a sudden glance or a grazing of our hands was some kind of signal from you. Who the fuck was I kidding. GOD and now I'm mad at you for not doing a thing. What the fuck is wrong with me. You didn't do a thing except not be attracted to me. Not that I can blame you. Even I'll admit there's only so many farts one person should be allowed to emit before they become bio-hazardous. I don't even know what the fuck I'm trying to say here. I guess I just want things to go back to the way they were. Before I felt this, before all of it. I just want that moment in the library back. And I don't want to weird you out either. I only hope these last few weeks can be spent as friends not as two people too uncomfortable to even be around each other due to some phantom conflict that shouldn't have been there in the first place. For some reason I feel like that Robert Frost poem from the outsiders relates to this.  Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.   I feel like our first moments were gold but then something happened whethere it was me or you it really doesn't matter. We can't ever have it back...nothing gold can stay.  Whatever fuck it.You'll probably never ever read this but whatever. I just needed you to know how I felt and that you don't need to worry about giving me the wrong signals and all that bullshit Christine fed me. No i'm not mad at you either so don't go getting all...Christine-y. Hey so when's the cast party?....heh heh.... yeah bye

      So I got bored and had nothing better to do than post on here. Man do I need a life. I was listening to my Bob Dylan albums a minute ago and "Forever Young" came on. I don't think enough people realize just how deep this man truly is. He's a poet in the truest sense of the word. All you have to do is listen to that song and you'll understand. Songs like "I shall be released" and "Shelter from the storm" are other good examples. I know this is a pointless post but I had to get the word out. Listen to Bob Dylan NOW. Don't download it like a cheap little putz, get off your ass and go down to the closest music store and buy as much of his stuff as you can. As much as possible, he's like money ya can never have enough.

      Back from work... can't believe i'm saying this but I think i'm starting to understand what Blink 182 was talking about in that song. You know the one admit it. Had an epiphany whilst filling a car at pump 6... Being depressed about things as trivial as high school crushes or crap like that is just a waste of energy. Shit happens ya gotta just roll with the punches and...throw them 'bows and all that good time jazz. I guess what I'm saying is I've decided not to get hung up on some girl that I barely even know. Chalk one up for those damn glands right? Oh well. Listening to Bob Marley and really wanting to get drunk. Never gonna happen judging by the current state of my social life. I always get the same thing "Oh yeah we totally should do something I call ya *insert day/time/date in general here)" And guess what they never do. Whatever. Fuck it. I'll save my liver for pickling some other night. I still feel like a dork and/or a 13 year old girl when I post on here. "Dear Diary tee hee" puhleeze. Still it feels good to get some things off my chest. I'm still working up the courage to talk about my dad. There's alot to sift through and I don't know if I'll like what I see when I get through. Listening to love songs when your single and desperate is really depressing I gotta tell ya. Well I've got nothing else to say tonight so i think I'll go play some video games...and then I wonder why I don't have a girlfriend...

      Yeah so first post on this thingy WHOOO!! I've been making fun of people who used this for the last bit of while and now i find myself...using it..??? Anyhoo.... yeah this summer has sucked my ass so far. Working at the co-op gas bar is the lamest job ever. Bad pay, bad shifts, lame managers the usual. In sticking with the emo mystique I guess I should be obliged to spill my feelings in some form of lame poem or something so how about this....  Raindrops keep falling on my head Yeah I already screwed this Haiku up (is that how ya spell it??)  I guess I can express how I feel using the immortal words of one 50 (fitty) cent. And I quote "In this white man's worl I'm similar to the squirrel. Looking for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut."  I told the girl of my dreams how I felt about her a few months ago but got shut down like...a guy getting shut down. I'm just gonna say to her...You say no one wants to be with you but I did and you said no. Think about that next time you mention all that jazz... I just realized how egotistical sounds. Can't think of a better way to word it. sorry.  My parents....I'll save for another time. That subject deserves a post all to itself.  Anyhoo I'm off to pump some vehicular orifice. Adios
