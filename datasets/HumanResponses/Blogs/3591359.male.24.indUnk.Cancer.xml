      Well IM just listening to some old Belle and Sebastian, and IM thinking way too much. Its reminding me of times gone past. And IM getting too old. Funny story, my dad looks at me yesterday and asks me how old I am, and I say 24. He was amazed, he thought I was 21 going on to 22. Pretty funny. My birthday was a bust, I worked all day, went to the nutritionist at 8:30am, and I haven't gained anything, I really don't get it. Yeah so think I did nothing all night, My friend A gave me a call, he gave me two prints of his (really nice and contemporary) and some underwear. But all was well, Elliott wrote me an email whising me a good b-day, and offering to buy me a drink this weekend. IM trying not to be attracted to him, its hard, ironic don't you think. Well thats about it for now.

      The weekend was indescribable. Friday night was the best. I met my friend Elliott at the bar, we were the only ones there. So he played his guitar for me, and then we played tribond with the bartender. After that we went to Donatella Versace's house were there were tons of familar faces, but I knew few names. So me and Elliott were being anti social and just chatting all night. I heart Elliott, I was giving him advice about meeting girls. But secertlly I wished he would ask me back to his room. As well we talked about a lot of things, art, third world countries, and being adopted. I must say it was a good night, I really like getting to know the straight boys. I went home around four thirty. And I did the responsible son thing and took a cab home. I just couldn't call my parents that late, even though I know they would have picked me up. Im spoiled like that. But now that i think about it, I should of went to elliotts room to use the phone, and maybe something unexpected would of happened, hmmmm I'll never know. Anyway that's about it.

      So I just went through some of my old art work.  I usually do this one every year to remains of times gone by. And I must say I was impressed.  No head swelling here. I was impressed that I actually did all this work, I made these images.  And I think to myself "where the fuck has this person gone. . . Who was he?".  I don't know.  Lately I've been wrapped up with work and trying to get my mind to land.  Its seems like I never get this low blood sugar thing.  Oh to make matters worse I lost a couple of pounds, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  I would love to seriously just leave, that's it just stop everything and leave. Hmm. . .  Im the type to think way too much. Looking at the art that I produced got me inspired. I keep telling myself that I should rent out the studio. Well I should, I just don't know what's stopping me from doing it. That and applying to school.

      hey ya'll hows it been? Me? Oh you know how it is. So this is it the big old blog.  Well then. I decided to hop on the blog wagon because it seemed like a nice way to stay in contact with my friend stacy.  Now stacey you can know all the things that are happing in my small life. oh and as well other people are welcome.  so this is it. I don't have much to say, well there is this one thing.  I think I find relegious guys to be really cute. What the hell am I talking about? you may ask. Well these two young guys came into the store that i work in and they were wearing white shirts, gray pants and ties, they were two cute, okay maybe to much acne but you know there was somthing very sexy aobut it. I think its because its so forbidden.  Hmm I think it would be so hot to seduce a little religous boy and make out with him in churh te he.  anyway thats my little bit of something for tody, maybe i should join a religous group hmmmm its an idea
