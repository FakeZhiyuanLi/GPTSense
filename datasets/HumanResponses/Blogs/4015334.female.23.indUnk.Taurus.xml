      So last night I was talking to a friend and, like me, she has a slight celebrity obsession. (Don't we all to some extent?) But anyway I didn't know how deep into a trench I was getting with this behavior until we started talking about celebrity children. Branching off from the topic of adoption (not just celebrity adoption but adoption in general) we immediately went into the intriguing&nbsp;life of&nbsp;Angelina Jolie. And then as if she were my sister I&nbsp;blurted out&nbsp;her son's name. It was almost instinctual. Maddox. It rolled off the tongue. Maddox. My own cousin had a baby about 4 days ago or so, granted she's in another state, but I don't even know what sex the baby is much less what their freakin' name is. But Maddox. I was amazed and then I realized I go through a whole list. Maddox, Apple, Lola, Rocco, Rumer, Ryder. And once again I can't name my own cousins. I'm sick. That's all.

      Welcome to my world, welcome to my world, welcome to my world of toys. If you are joining me on my blog for the first time (which you most certainly are since this is my first official posting) and are not familiar with this tune it plays continuously in every F.A.O. Schwarz. I know this because I once worked there for a total of about 3 months before the song officially drove me nuts. Which brings me to the reasoning behind the title. I feel I have reached complete insanity at this point in the afternoon. Colors have begun to bleed into one another and all I see are fuzzy shapes and this song just won't stop playing in my mind. It's kind of fun. But I'd rather be home. Asleep. In the future I plan on making this blog about something but for now I just wanted to see it up and I don't have the current mind capabilities to think about anything other than my world of toys. So until next time kids, welcome to my world.

      So I was inspired by the gayest photo I've ever seen of Adrien Brody and his lap dog (wish I could find the picture but I can't). The gist of it is that they are both in leather, Brody in a jacket, his dog in a purse. I wanted to find more photos of this stupidity to share with you so I typed in "celebrities and their dogs" in a Google search. Can you imagine people devote themselves and their websites to something so foolish (and amusing). In fact I just found there's even an entire magazine devoted to this. Of course it features Paris Hilton on it's cover. It's called Modern Dog. If you want to see how trivial and obsessive people can be, here's a link:  urlLink http://moderndog.ca/  . I lied the magazine doesn't merely focus on celebrities and their dogs, it also has such features has "Dogstyle" and "Entertaining" for those special occasions for your pup. What is up with this? Are dogs the new children? If so I'm cool with that, stop having children Hollywood it will leave room for some newcomers to come in. But I think this may be going to far. Check this out.  urlLink http://www.boomer129.com/  This has reached beyond just being a socialite fashionista thing. There are now hip-hop ensembles for your canine. Because what's more hard-core than dressing up your dog?
