First I need to introduce you to everyone.             FRIENDS Colt-Colt is 16 and is a works with me, he is a very fun guy except when you're at his house 'cause then he is exceptionally weird.  He is a first degree black belt in karate and has been taking for 3 years.  He is a neat freak and is going to be a sophmore at Lafayette High School.

Kim-Kim is 16 and has red hair.  She is going to be a junior at Lafayette High.  I have known her for a long time and she takes karate and is a first degree black belt.  She is very perky and excited and is my only friend that has red hair.  She also speaks l33t.  Sensei Shane-I have to call him sensei cause he teaches me.  He is 22 and takes karate and is a second degree black belt and has been in karate for nine years I think, he also teaches.  He is very very funny and is like my big brother, I am supposedly "exactly like him" when he was younger             FAMILY Mom-My moms name is Stacey she has been my mom since I was born.  She is wierd sometimes and it can be hard to live with her.  Dad-My dads name is Harold and has been my dad since I was born.  He and mom are divorced and he can be wierd and it can be hard to live with him.           SEE YA!!
