      "If only we arrange our life according to that principle which counsels us that we must always hold to the difficult, then that which now still seems to us the most alien will become what we most trust and find most faithful." - Rilke   I read this quote months ago and liked it, but&nbsp;it&nbsp;did not resonate with me at the time based on my life experience up to that point. &nbsp;Sort of reminds me of how a story or a song can never have any meaning to you until you experience something similar.&nbsp; Your mind can likely process the words, but you can't feel it.&nbsp;   The last 6 months of my life has brought about changes I could have never foreseen, would never have asked for, but now, could not&nbsp;imagine my life without.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change is inevitable,&nbsp;everything is impermanent, the only thing we can&nbsp;count&nbsp;on is things&nbsp;never&nbsp;staying the&nbsp;same.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we make up these sayings for comfort or as a coping strategy?&nbsp;   The title of this blog is about rites - rites of passage and what they mean to me, a twenty-something and what they mean for others.&nbsp; It seems like we go through many of these rites in our lifetime.&nbsp; I wonder if they get any easier as we get older and have the ability to recognize them?&nbsp; Seems like&nbsp;awareness is half the battle.&nbsp; Like when someone has a problem and they say once you recognize it, you are half way there, or taking the first step, whatever.&nbsp; Bottom&nbsp;line, they are scary as hell, but maybe just that simple&nbsp;act of being aware could act as a comfort as we transition from&nbsp; one phase to the next?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Funny, I am about to leave work for the day and I just happened to walk by the horoscope page&nbsp;someone left out in our work area.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to not put a lot of faith in astrology, but decided to take a look for kicks. For Leo it said&nbsp;"The more you accept change the more&nbsp;successful you will be today.&nbsp; The&nbsp;desire to cling to safe ground is natural, but have faith and dive in.&nbsp; Trust that the water is just fine."&nbsp;&nbsp;As a&nbsp;friend once said to me "The cosmos sing a familiar song."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      In response to a post I received yesterday, I am contemplating (for the millionth time) what it means to live in the "now".&nbsp; I consider myself in the fetal stage of studying Buddhism and of course, one part of it's central core is about "being present".&nbsp; A seemingly simple concept but in actuality - not!&nbsp; I read somewhere that we spend over 90% of our waking hours consumed with thoughts of either the past or the future.&nbsp; This is definitely true for me.&nbsp; I try to catch myself when I notice my thoughts turing&nbsp;into a vicious cycle of "what if I had?", "what happens when?"&nbsp; Even as I write this I cannot merely look at this screen and focus on what I write.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;once said to someone "No, I do not&nbsp;think about the future because there is always stimuli coming at me that&nbsp;is&nbsp;going to affect that future."&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to wake up each day and live honestly with purpose&nbsp;and practice kindness towards those&nbsp;around me.&nbsp; But, I guess in typical American fashion I feel like I have to be future minded and strive&nbsp;towards lofty goals or I would be a considered stagnant and&nbsp;uninteresting otherwise.&nbsp; But, what is so wrong with contentment&nbsp;and like Jack Nicholson in "As good as it gets" is there a point when you wonder "Is this as good as it gets?"&nbsp;and if so, then I am okay with that.

      The purpose of this post is to seek others out there trying to find their place or passion in this game we call life.&nbsp; I think it is a game and one that should be played vigorously and with purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for others perspectives on rites of passage and what "it" is all about for them.

      On a recent hiking trip through Utah and Arizona I was meandering around Flagstaff and stumbled upon a used book shop for the local university. I felt like had arrived at an intellectual mecca surrounded by forgotten friends from my college days. One of the books I stumbled upon was "The Book" by Philosopher/Psychologist Alan Watts. I found the following passge particularly applicable to my current state of quarter-life angst:  "...the individual is taught to live and work for some future in which the impossible will at last happen, if not for him, then at least for his children. We are thus breeding a type of human being incapable of living in the present -- that is, of really living.For unless one is fully able to live fully in the present, the future is a hoax. There is no point whatever in making plans for the future which you will never be able to enjoy. When your plans mature, you will still believing for some other future beyond. You will never, never be able to sit back with full contentment and say, "Now, I've arrived!" Your entire education has deprived you of this capacity because it was preparing you for the future, instead of showing you how to be alive now. In other words, you have been hypnotized or conditioned by an educational system arranged in grades or steps, supposedly leading to some ultimate Success. First nursery school or kindergarten, then the grades or forms of elementary school, preparing you for the great moment of secondary school! But then more steps , up and up to the coveted goal of the university.Here, if you are clever, you can stay indefinitely by getting into graduate school and becoming a permanent student. Otherwise you are headed step by step to the great Outside World of family-raising, business, and profession.Yet graduation day is a very temporary fulfillment, for with your first sales-promotion meeting you are back in the same old system, being urged to make that quota (and if you do, they'll give you a higher quota) and so progress up the ladder to sales manager, vice-president, and at last,president of your own show. In the meantime, the insurance and investment people have been interesting you in plans for retirement -- that really ultimate goal of being able to sit back and enjoy the fruits of all your labors. But when that day comes, your anxieties and exertions will have left you with a weak heart, false teeth, prostate trouble, sexual impotence,fuzzy eyesight, and vile digestion.All this might have been wonderful if, at every stage, you had been able to play it as a game....."

      Okay, so I was feeling a little flip on Friday when I wrote my last post.  In staying true to my analytical self, I thought more about when you know (if ever) that you have grown up.   I think that awareness of one's mortality brings you a step closer to this adult sense of self.  That and the gradual realization we are all more similar than we think.  Realizing one's own insignificance in the grand scheme of things is a very humbling, profound experience.  Not to say that we are not each important and worthwhile in our own right, but grasping that realization that the world really does not revolve around us.  Some people grasp this in adolesence, most in early adulthood, and sadly, some people don't grasp this until they are knocking on death's door.  But hey, as they say, better late than never.  we are all just part of the dance.

      Have you ever have a moment where you feel like you have finally grown up? People around my office have recently been sharing stories about when they knew it was happening to them.  One guy said he knew he had grown up when he hired a maid to clean his house for the first time.  A woman said that having just given birth, the moment her child was placed on her chest, she finally felt like a grown-up.  Another man said he felt like a grown-up when he hired a moving company to move into his first house.  Having recently bought a house myself, I thought, finally, this is it... I will get a sense of having arrived in that grown-up place I have heard adults talk about since I was a child but had yet to visit myself. Alas, that did not happen.  I think having that grown-up sense of self is akin to falling in love. It is not necessarily one moment, but a collection of moments that when you add them up and reflect back on them, you feel that "a-ha" sense of knowing. A couple of my moments:  Realizing my Aunt. R, who I always admired and viewed as so chic and cutting edge now has furniture and decor that is dated 1980s and will surely stay that way until she dies. Sort of like Grandma's furniture before her, you know it is dated and was probably cool at one time, but is no longer. Of course, it is perfectly good stuff and doesn't NEED replacing, but...... Will I be like that someday? Probably.  Last night I was having a group birthday dinner with 2 of my Leo friends from high school and my best friend S. who I see everyday. The 2 Leos are married and S. and I are not. As I looked around the table I realized "Sh*T, they have HUSBANDS to go home to!" and when in the heck did we ALL start getting crow's feet?  It is happening. I am growing up. I can't fight it. I don't think I want to anyway. Like love, it just sort of happens.

      Camaraderie & Compassion I once said to someone that this existential angst many of us feel throughout our various stages of life might be alleviated if we were to sit with an elderly person for a couple of hours and converse with them as to our troubles, joys, fears, etc.  I think they would likely listen with a smile and nod their head from time to time in agreement while in their mind they reminisce about similar thoughts & experiences in their own lives.   Perhaps if this was tried as an alternative to taking prescribed antidepressants for depression & anxiety,  it just might produce the desired effect of making some of us feel like it's all gonna be alright.

      When did Salons -- as in the ones where people get together to share ideas go out of fashion?  The other night I went into to a bar up on Capitol Hill here in Seattle that had a dark, European, intellectual feel to it where people were huddled at tables sipping german beers and talking about things that made their faces look very intense and interested in what their table mate was saying.  At my table we were talking about politics, religion, music, etc.  It had a very salon-esque feel to it except none of us were officially writers, scientists, or philosophers.  I wish there were more places where one could go and overhear or partake in conversations that stimulate the mind.  I guess that is what the blog world could be seen as, but there is something lost when you take away the personal face-to-face component of  debate &  conversation.  There is something being lost (but also gained) by our ever-increasing reliance on computers.
