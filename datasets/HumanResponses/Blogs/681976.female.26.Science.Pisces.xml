      can't seem to link the picture today. the regular price (january 15, 2004) is $78 as it is part of their spring collection. it comes in khaki colour, light blue, and reddish. any would be fabulous since the material is really awesome and nice details on the pockets are really cute!

      all of my skirts are high-waisted  nothing too hoochie.  velvety like my high-waisted one would be just great.  polyester might not be very comfortable but cotton too casual.

         Mothers & Women    A few nights ago my mother, sister, and I sat around the table after dinner and our conversation was about our family.  In recent events, one of my male cousins (four years older than I am) got married.  In this conversation, in talking about the past, I suddenly came to this realization that I am my mother's oldest daughter and she is her mother's oldest daughter.  To top it off, my maternal grandmother was the oldest daughter when her older sister passed away at a young age.  If my sister realized it I do not believe she felt it as profoundly as   I felt this enormous weight that things do not change  .  All of a sudden I felt like a part of history and I could feel  in me  all of my mother's struggles and my grandmother's struggles.  For example, a common thing to do during my grandmother's youth was to give up newborn daughters because they aren't going to "stay with the family" twenty years hence when they marry and take on their husband's name.  Hence great-grandfather wanted to give away his newborn daughter as he gave up another one before but my grandmother and her mother were the strong women they were and stood up against him and the daughter stayed with the family.  My mother had her own set of struggles starting from her teenage years when her whole family fled to Hong Kong and she was for some reason I have not yet learned still in China and did not join them till some time later.  As if that wasn't difficult enough, she also had to face the struggles that accompany immigrating to a foreign country that spoke a language she was not fluent in.    It makes me wonder what is in store with me because I am my mother's eldest daughter and she is grandmother's eldest daughter and grandmother was an eldest daughter.  I also wonder if I can live up to the women that precede me?      (Free & Cheap) Books I am reading....    Recently I download two novels from reading and in my search found the following websites useful:     urlLink Text Library    urlLink Bibliomania    urlLink Spark Notes     I downloaded    Fanny Hill: Memories of a Woman of Pleasure    and    Mansfield Park   .   Fanny , it makes me blush, is very explicit in I'm not sure I can sit through another 8 Parts (10 Parts to the novel) the way it is going.  I'm not sure I can see the merit in the story that is unfolding nor am I partial towards John Cleland's style.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about his writing that is really awkward for me to get around.   Mansfield Park , on the other hand, is almost guarantee to please me because I like Jane Austen's style and writing.  I haven't gotten through the awful introduction yet but while wading through it, I'm a little nervous because  Mansfield  is apparently a really different sort of Jane Austen novel with darker and more complex themes than the other classics  Sense and Sensibility ,  Pride and Prejudice , and  Emma .  I have M. to thank for re-igniting my desire to read when I went to visit her at her desk earlier and she was reading  Pride and Prejudice  online.  Besides my sister, I don't know anyone else who reads that stuff for the fun of it (i.e., outside of the high school English curriculum).  So we went to  urlLink Chapters / Indigo  and sought out bargain literature.  We were not so fortunate to find our book list in the Bargain Books section but it was amazing that she could get the same copy of  Pride  from $3.95 up to $20.95 depending on if she wanted a "good" introduction, notes at the end, matted cover, or some meaningful print the publisher had to pay some money to.  Needless to say, and I don't blame her, she bought the $3.95 copy.  I also own a $3.95 copy of  Emma  -- I love the novel, not the cover art or the insight provided buy someone other distinguished author.  For  Fanny  I didn't have quite the selection and could only select a Modern Classics edition going for $15.00, and so I didn't.  (Then I read Part 2 online and was grateful that I didn't buy it.)  Picked up a $5.99 copy of  Mansfield  from Signet Collections with a cool matted cover and some print on the cover.  It's all good.  :)

         You know it's pretty sad when....    the last entry that I posted was a week ago and it was a Friday Five.  If it weren't for this intermediate blurb, I'd have two posts that are Friday Five's in a row.  Even still, you can tell the frequency of my posts by the fact that I do the F5's quite religiously and there aren't that many entries these days between them despite my desperate attempt here at a blurb.  Consider it a Wynism -- when the (school-)going get tough, I just drop most everything that isn't essential.  That means blogging -- you wanna hear daily blogs of my school-fears and career-fears... even if they are very Wynistic? -- diminishes and I've got to have some really good excuse to go for a jog... like if I didn't take a shower and I may as well jog and then take a shower before going to school?  As for Friday Five's -- I like them because they give me a chance to talk about things I would not otherwise think about or dream of discussing.  Other than that, I don't really know that much about what to blog about.  Apparently there are a lot books out there these days that instruct you on how to make really fascinating blog and your daily hits will just skyrocket....    f5        What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?   Physically: Jogging and dancing.  Mentally: writing - hence a blog!  And masses of communications via e-mail, IM, and recently, letters.   What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?   Sleep.  Or really leisurely check my junk-mail.  I do everything outside of the house.   What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?   I don't know if these are standard aromatherapy scents but I like   tea tree oil   and   juniper   and otherwise invigorating and fresh scents.  None of that heavy stuff.  I like fruity and flowerly scents like roses and strawberries.  :)   Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?   Probably by myself.  I'm not a loner or anything, it's just that those things I would do to relax, I would do alone!   What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?   Uhm....  Having someone sit on my back....  Hanging myself upside down and stretching myself beyond the point of (slight) pain because it makes me feel limber all over.    Doing the dishes.        traceroute    You can  urlLink trace  the path taken by special packets sent from your computer to a website you commonly visit - how many different routers are along the way between you (source) and them (destination) and how long it takes for a small message to be sent.  Well  no wonder  I can never load up a page from Hong Kong from my home connection (dial-up) because my traceroute program keeps on timing out when trying to sent packets to sites like South China Morning Post, HK Polytech U....  If you really wanted to know that.

         f5        Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people?   I certainly try to.     Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why?   Overall?    Email.    I find it most efficient for formal and informal use.  If someone's important enough, then I don't mind more personal, monopolizing communication methods like telephone or meeting in person.  Each has it own use, I guess - blog comments are ways of advertising yourself (I think) when you might not know the person but want to be heard anyhow.  And now that I've started corresponding to my godbrother by   snail mail  , I've been reminded of how personal those are and until we all have Palms or tablet PCs or other instant-on devices, nothing is quite so personal (and portable) when someone is so far away.     Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it?   ICQ & MSN & (if it counts) SMS.  With someone I have real conversations with, IM rocks.  But I think   SMS is the  cooooooolest  for it's instantness, lack of need of computer, and the jargon that has evolved  .     Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away?   Half n Half.     Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"?   Depends on the person.      3171 f5    This reminds me of a "Friday Five" that was my Networking assignment due last  Friday .  Here it was:  Write a paragraph answering the following questions:     What Internet application (e.g. email, web browsing, FTP, etc.) do you use most often?  What is usually the goal of your use?  How would you have achieved this goal if there had been no Internet?  What are the advantages of the network application in (1) over the pre-network technique in (3)?  What are the advantages of the pre-network technique in (3) over the network application in (1)?      elgooG    Finally, I find this site really cute and, uhm, backwards --  urlLink elgooG .  Hehe, geek humour.

         chinese in chinatown    as promised before, i wanted to mention an observation of mine during my most recent trip to Toronto.  i won't get too long-winded here because i'm tired and can't express myself properly.  used to be that i didn't like going to bubble tea with my sister or with a non-Chinese person.  used to be that i would feel uncomfortable being with a CBC (canadian-born chinese) person gabbing in english in a predominantly chinese place.  i think that the growing number of mandarin-speaking people (my only dialect so far is cantonese) has really changed things in the chinese areas.  i can no longer assume that everyone in "chinatown" speaks my dialect.  and employees of a store or restaurant cannot tell from looking at me if i speak mandarin or cantonese or rocky-kinda-cantonese.  and the new(er) mandarin people pretty much have to have english because they cannot expect a great deal of the HK (cantonese-speaking) people to understand them.  that isn't the only reason why i feel as if english is some kind of taboo in chinatown any longer.  either i could feel it or i'm just living with the facts but there are a lot of chinese-canadians coming of age who speak english fluently and chinese (either dialect) clumsily.  i always wanted to be more chinese than they are but try as i might, my cantonese is not fluent as one coming from Hong Kong and my reading abilities are even more pitiful.  i used to only order food that i could read but given my reading abilities have not improved significantly (when school-learning  always  takes a precedence over chinese-learning), my dinners become  really  boring.  screw that.  so i just order whatever i can't read in chinese in english.  the chinese-canadians who insist on english are an increasing demographic and that is making life easier by forcing an anglocization of things chinese.  i'm starting to believe that is still okay,   things do not become less  chinese  for a change in language of representation.    that's all i have to say for now about it.    the sweetest thing    upon V. and M.'s suggestion, i rented  the sweetest thing , a movie starring cameron diaz, christina applegate, and selma blair (in order of importance in the movie).  they recommended the movie to me because there are three girls who are great friends for ages and a slice of their life.  they could see some of the crazy things the girls did and see the three of us in those girls.  i think they saw me as "jane," the character that selma blair plays.  aside from the dark hair, i don't see much i have in common with the nympho character whose major storylines were, uhm, getting into embarassing situations with her boyfriend....  "christina" (diaz) and "courtney" (applegate) go on a crazy road trip and leave in/sensible "jane" at home (which is the usual case with us: V. and M. live close to each other and hang out more).  Sis said that people raved the sweetest thing as an accurate portrayal of the way girls act when they let go and are a little wild.  i beg to differ.  it was silly and inane.  it ranks with  romy and michelle's high school reunion  and  clueless  featured more intelligent and likeable characters, in my opinion.      tomasino's    lunch at  urlLink tomasino's  that i have mentioned before but i want to mention again!  this is my third visit to them.  their  ambrosia  pizza is excellent with a neat and yummy toppings mushroom, spinach, and sausage.  today for the first time, i had their pasta.  i ordered chicken tarragon while S. ordered chicken pesto, both 9.50.  been next door to  cafe chianti  and their pasta is expensive (~$20) and really heavy.  true to form, i got pasta in a cream sauce.  true to form, i regretted it half-way through and i was eyeing S.'s lighter pesto-tomato sauce....!  :p  my complaint is that pasta usually isn't flavourful enough for me like that served at most places but tomasino's totally hit the spot without overloading the plate and sending you home sick with fullness.   (four point four / five)

         f5        What was/is your favorite subject in school? Why?   Probably math.  It was never difficult.  I liked biology as well.  Of course that wasn't difficult either, and far more interesting.   Who was your favorite teacher? Why?   Dr. Jennifer Chapman, my high school English teacher.  I liked her rigorous lectures better than unstructured (slack) of other teachers.  There were a great deal of wacky and memorable teachers in my high school...  really  wacky.  I can't remember too well, but I also liked Mr. William Hunter who was my chemistry teacher for two years.  He was a bit like a mad scientist and now that I'm older and more educated, I wish I could go back and talk to him!   What is your favorite memory of school?   Graduation!  Finally getting out of that insufferably clique and closed environment and the prospect of new school, new people, new city.  I had a fairly good graduation (lots of big awards) to send me off.   What was your favorite recess game?   In elementary school my best friend had a great imagination and we played "House" and other elaborate you could say role-playing games the drew a lot of people.   What did you hate most about school?   That I went to a small school and there was little diversity.  It was suffocating.

         Courses for Fall 2002    Finally, after a harrowing two weeks, I have decided which courses I will subjecting myself to for the next four months.  It wasn't all that I expected but it's somewhat more strategic (taking Neurocomputing) than my previous plan (to take Medical Biotech) because the current plan is 50% more towards my next degree than the original plan.  Here's the scoop:   Monday:  2:30-3:30pm -- Analysis of Algorithms 4:30-5:30pm -- Network Computing   Tuesday:  1:00-2:30pm -- Artificial Intelligence  (audit)  2:30-4:00pm -- Neurocomputing   Wednesday:  12:30-1:30pm -- Analaysis of Algorithms (tutorial) 2:30-3:30pm -- Analysis of Algorithms 4:30-5:30pm -- Network Computing   Thurssday:  10:00-11:30am -- Network Computing (tutorial) 1:00-2:30pm -- Artificial Intelligence  (audit)  2:30-4:00pm -- Neurocomputing   Friday:  2:30-3:30pm -- Analysis of Algorithms 4:30-5:30pm -- Network Computing  Yay -- absolutely no morning classes!  Which means I can get in and jog three times a week and another benefit of routine is the ability to wake up early on Saturdays and play badminton as well.  :) :)  The most blasted thing is how courses start getting jumbled in my head. ....Algo is about the analysis of algorithms and their optimization at some point in the course. ....So my head is started to bust and spin a little too fast when the AI prof proposes coming up with a learning algorithm for specific robots and their optimization. ....Transitional probabilities and Markov are familiar from Bioinformatics last winter. ....Neurocomputing will not focus on neural  networks  but be more of a neuroscience (Eep!  That is my sister's degree.) course with lots of computation. ....The prof looked at the whiteboard of AI notes and commented how far the AI class was in material and how the Neuro class would cover that stuff at a later point in the class. ....Learning algorithms.  Reinforcement learning....  Blarrrgh!  It's actually not so bad.  I usually take the applicability of various present courses (in Computer Science) to past courses (in Biochemistry) I have taken as a good sign of extending on my integrated knowledge base.  That I'm making a sensible cross-over.  Or something or other.

          Vanity Fair     I just finished reading   Vanity Fair  .  No, not the magazine but the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray.  The really craziest part, in retrospect, is how I picked up the 670-page novel only because one of my favourite novels of all time (  Little Women  ) made reference to the concept of a Vanity Fair in a chapter wherein poor Meg spends a weekend in high society.  You see,  Vanity Fair  -- much to my surprise because I didn't know anything about it going in to it! -- follows the stories of two girls after their graduation from high school (you could call it that).  Rebecca Sharp was only able to attend the prestigious school because she could be a French teacher to the younger children and spent her formative years before Miss Pinkerton's Academy hanging with low-lifes associating with her late father.  She is a witty and resourceful but bitter girl, from our first introduction to her.  Amelia Sedley, on the other hand, was privileged and loved by everyone.  She's not so smart or resourceful as Rebecca but what need for those attributes when you're rich and guaranteed a rich husband?  Set near the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars (i.e., the Battle of Waterloo), a lot of unexpected things happen.  Thackeray is affectionate towards his two anti-heroines and sometimes, for good measure, he steps out of story-telling mode into lesson-rendering mode to dispense some wise nuggets about the nature of Vanity Fair and it's inhabitants.  I was in a panic attack while reading the novel, groaning over injustices and misunderstandings and so forth that would have brought about such a speedier "happy" ending.  And the last 70 pages just kind of went over me because I just wanted to finish it.  Suffice it to say that the last ten pages were completely tumultuous to read.  I could identify 100% with the unrequited lover and his simpleton object of affection (guess who I'd be?) and hurrahed the dignified departure of the tortured lover but felt sad for the plight of the simpleton (who reminds me of me).  So fortunately, and it gives me hope, things do work out and the hardened villianess does the unaffected one due kindness (in a tough love kind of way) and -- what can I say? -- things work out.  I put the blessed novel down after 50 pages last summer because sometimes Thackeray meanders into an introduction of a new personage and you have no idea where he is going to go with it.  It gets overwhelming and mind-boggling.  I couldn't keep the characters straight when my concentration was not focused on the novel.  There are still a few pages here and there that I just skipped over - another background segment and I started to learn that it would not affect my understanding of the grand scheme of things to have skipped it.   Excellent ,  wonderful  book.  Just not an easy read as I read once, in a review, that it was the  "bane of English literature"  for the vast number of characters introduced and, for my part, the complex sentence structure and obscure words used in profusion.  That would conclude summer reading (~sigh) and now it is on to the definitely drier  urlLink  Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience   written by a Dalhousie professor,  urlLink Dr. Thomas Trappenberg  to decide whether or not I will be taking his  urlLink Neurocomputing  course!!

         House cleaning    just tryin' to clean things up here.....  gone is the schedule for the fall previously here on this day's post.  i've tried a new strategy this summer - start taking way more courses than i will eventually for the first two weeks and then drop all but three or four.  this just bites.  besides, the table was wrecking havoc on my blog (for aesthetics) and so had to go.  hope to finalize the schedule soon and get it up again in a prettier format.  i think i'll keep this black/blue template and   personalize   it soon....  it's probably a better idea to not have personal blog stuff on my school server anyhow and will  move stuff away when i have the time, when things settle down.... so things are  not  settled down since returning from T.  in a way, i don't want it to because i definitely associate laziness and apathy with Hali and action and alertness wtih T.

         2002 Montreal / Toronto Trip Journal    Here are the transcribed contents of my trip journal for August 25, 2002 to September 3, 2002.     Day One (Sunday, August 25) --  Grande disillusionment      (12:44)  Can you imagine the dreams we started to build when we visited  urlLink VIA Rail's  website, re-inforced by one of our aunts' testimony that the Eastern coast trains ( The Ocean ) are newer and nicer than traisn servicing central Canada.  No wonder every other train car had pictures except for Economy / Coach class.  You see, a couple of years ago my sister did her "green project" for her grade 11 art credit.  (How many shades of green?   Many. )  So many that at the sight of green these days she gets a little nauseated.  :p  And the coach cars are all...  dirty  teal.   The cars on (Bedford Highway) next door are going faster than we are.  "It's so frustrating."   We didn't expect the running commentary set to classical background music.  I'd have to say that after kayaking yesterday, seeing the widest part of Bedford Basin (3.2 km) triggered some different emotions and thoughts.  (2:40 PM)  We are in Truro.  Do you think we are really sheltered or prissy?  ("I think we're prissy, more than sheltered," answers my sister.)  I mean, we look left and right and we are looking at everything with such disdain.  The washrooms, the canteen.  Even the dining car was a disappointment that did not live up to our expectations -- the pasta salad was mushy and my Montreal smoked meat very tough.  It's free food on an airplane and so much tastier.  My sister offered a (one point six / five) rating.  Failing, yes, because it really didn't cut it.  We're looking forward to dinner, ironically, as a means to get out of the coach car again!  (21:21)  Well, this nearly concludes a whole day on the train.  Still feeling kind of fresh.  We stepped out at Moncton station to use some civilized facilities.  Since then we have passed numerous small New Brunswick towns - Rogersville, Miramichi, Bathurst....  We had another meal on the dining car.  Sis had chick pea curry on rice pilaf ($14) and the fact it was on the same rice pilaf I had was very wrong.  She said the curry tasted like microwave curry and now we are afraid she's going to smell.  I had a steak ($22) requesting for medium but it was far more cooked than that of a woman sharing a table with us also requestint a medium steak.  It was so-so.  Just doesn't cut it and I really miss airplane food!  Sis rates dinner itself (two point seven / five) and desserts (from Sara Lee and ultra-rich) a (three point nine / five).  Somewhere in New Brunswick, we saw a   full rainbow   - the whole arch and both ends.  How often do you bet to see that??  I wonder what phenomena accounts for the semi-circle shape of rainbows?  Anyways, soon to sleep we go.  We get fresh disposable pillows and rejected the thin, torn, green blankets.     Day Two (Monday, August 26)     (21:39)  It has been  such  a day!  We're sitting in  gare central  with two hours to go before departure and nothing much to do.  Arrived on time at 8 AM and had a small fuss over how to store our luggage until 11:30 PM because a very reliable personnel-supervised storage closes at 7PM.  We found red-clad porters who would check our bags for us and safe-keep them for a fee of $2.50/piece....  We didn't even get luggage tags so pray and hope they don't get lost and we can't claim them!  My handy-dandy (and free) CAA booklet map of Montreal was a blur so we got a walking map that at least identified our current location but we still did not know how to locate any of 10 Chez Cora's Dejeuner locations I jotted down.  So we wandered along Rene Levesuque (big-sounding street) until University and up University to St. Catherine where we found an Indigo bookstore to browse Montreal maps and eventually bought one.  Item of Note: Even in downtown, there can be seen a shocking lack of pedestrian traffic signals.  It's not like we pedestrians cannot obey car traffic signals but might this not suggest a downgrade in the priority or respect for pedestrians??    We had breakfast at  Chez Cora Dejeuners  on Stanley Ave.  It was featured once in a  Food & Hospitality  periodical to which we aare subscribed in a spotlight on breakfast restaurants (like  Smitty's  in Halifax and  The Golden Griddle  in Ontario).  Apparently Cora specializes in crepes so sis got Banana Crepes with English cream and I got Recolte 90 - half a slice of brioche french toast under an egg and bacon strips and the other half under a mountain of fruit.  We had a breakfast coctail ($2.95) each and that was a smooth (i.e., still runny) blend of pineapple, apple, strawberry, and blueberry.  What is brioche?  It's a slice of cinnamond roll, I learned.  While my choice was a meal capturing the "standard" (presence of bacon and eggs), the "french" (french toast), and the health-consciou (fruit), it was horribly rich and I could not finish.  Sis' banana crepes were also a large portion (three was enough).  Innovation aside and the presence of a younger clientele in the smoking section, I could hardly tell for my self Chez Cora from a Smitty's ack home.  After  petit dejeuner  that was not so  petit , we slowly made our way north because I had read somewhere (the  urlLink Montreal e-guide ) that from some point in  Parc Mont-Royal  is the best view of Montreal and Ile St-Helene.  There were a few gaps to my knowledge like where in the park to stop for the view and where the front entrance was.  We entered the park by some stone steps on the side and my heart began to sink because we found ourselves crawling through the woods with no end in sight.    Imagine the amusement and horror of park-goers when we emerged from the woods, ascending from a steep dirt path onto the wide-rock-paved main a little out-of-breath and dusty for city-slickers in long pants, combat-the-heat tight tank tops, and tousled hair!  It was like a vampy duo from  Sex and the City  meets the Nature Walk, completely inappropriately dressed!    Cursing and swearing and crying and whining we ascended the Mont like a couple of good sports and grumbled when we came to the end and saw a panorama of Montreal.  Grumbling because the descent was 2.9 km long and we were clocking maybe 1 km/25 minutes.  :p  I have read about (the existence) of the  "McGill ghetto"  but never had it really defined but for it being the area of food andn entertainment surrounding McGill University out of which students need not/may not tread.  It is with some regret we did not more fully explore the  Harvard Co-op  so we thought we'd explore this famed university a bit on our own.  For some reason, it was a place abuzz while I"m sure at the very same time Dalhousie and SMU campuses are ghosttowns and begin to liven up only next week with frosh.  Wandered around.  Universities don't change too much going from one to another.  And McGill frosh are not too different from Dalhousie frosh.  More diverse, definitely.  But just as confused and wide-eyed and green as anywhere else.  For the first time ever, with many people milling about, I dozed off in the middle of a scenic campus quad.  (Yesterday's sleep was truly unfitful.)   urlLink Montreal e-quide  suggested walking along  Rue Ste.-Catherine O. between University and Guy  as a  must-see  and it was fairly easy to find considering we limited ourselves to a box confined by Mont Royal to the north, Rene Levesque to the south, Ave McGill College to the east and Rue Peel to the west.  The section of Rue Ste.-Catherine ressembles in no small part  Queen Street West  in Toronto with the same big names - Stone Ridge, Gap, Caban, Eaton Center, and some additions.  That's why I chose to browse in  La Maison Simons  that was a happy hour of shopping.  It's a department store carrying it's own line (  twik  ) at competitive prices and some brand names as well.  I picked up a kangaroo-fur-collarged black shirt.  Twik is not a name known to Halifax....  bonus.  Several months ago both my sister and I read an article in the  urlLink Halifax Herald  about  Exos  the water bar in Montreal.  We were anxious to check it out and be whisked away by water-therapy.  We even figured out how to take a subway there ($2.25 for adult fare, ouch).  And walked into a  shop  whose walls were lined with water bottles for sale and the center of the small shop had displays of non-water for sale such as Swatch, Swiss Army, really elegant, space-age kind of pens, and wacky wind-up toys.  Talk about disappointment!  We expected a bar with service, small bites to eat, and water therapy in plenty and motif.  That was to be found (sort of) in the second location of Exos just around two corners.  Going around just one corner brough ust to  Rue St. Denis  and at once it struck us with its ressemblence to  Newbury Street  in Boston with its quaint buildings and shops located in the basements.  (Unlike Newbury's assortment of retail shops and restaurants, the storefronts on St. Denis were strictly eating establishments, nearly.)  Exos the bar didn't quite rock our world.  They had cow-print covers on the seats that weren't impressive for their novelty and it wasn't really populated.  A masseuse was giving a massage just outside the store on a quite street off St. Denis and charging $1 per minute.  The lite and healthy menu did not really make us salivate and so we left.  It  might  be worthwhile to check out  urlLink this site  for a new variant of charm / name bracelet.    We walked all along Rue St. Denis until the hill became too steep and decided after much delay on going to  Les 3 Brasseurs  housing a  micro-brasserie .  It was 98% french, we noticed, and so was the quarter (Rue St. Denis) which is what every tourist wants, right? - to get away from tourist traps.  I ordered their famous pizza - ready in three minutes - on a paper-thin crust and laden with onion, bacon, mushroom, and cheese (no tomato sauce, come to think of it).  It was over a foot in diameter and personal size in price but it was too much to eat!    With three hours to go until our train, we went to  Al Van Houtte  on McGill College Avenue near Rene Levesque for dessert.  Van Houtte appears to be a chain of cafe / bistros so I wanted to check one out.  It reminded me of  Plantation  in Toronto.  Service was so slow because it was constantly busy.  It was ridiculously slow, actualy but it was otherwise a-okay.  The train taking us to Toronto was really sweet.  Bright, blue upholstery, clean, new.  With the latest in traveling conveniences.  Guess our aunt had gotten whichever train was better mixed up.  Too bad we were just there to sleep!     Day Three (Tuesday, August 27)     Arrived in Toronto on time.  I don't usually feel out of place in Toronto but that is exactly how I felt going from the train station to the bustling subway station with my baggage rolling behind me.  With it, I felt like a stick in the mud with people threading around me because I was in their way of a fast-paced track to work.  No one opened doors who might at a slower hour.  It was very isolating.  Thankfully we don't have to walk around with baggage again!  (4:40 PM)    Dim sum at  New Century Plaza Restaurant  (ÊÀ¼Í»Ê¹Ù).  Some novel dishes included  round egg tofu with shrimp and chinese mushrooms ,  "zeen deuy"  that I couldn't stop eating, and  "tofu flower" .  Mmm - smacking lips.  Has Plantation at  Metro Square  (Warden & Steeles) left?  They have the best desserts.  Then some mad Chinese shopping at City Market.  Uncle Andrew might laugh that City Market and Pacific Mall are our favourite shopping malls.  It's sensible because we know which shops are worth it and where to draw the line at a given store knowing we will be satisfied at the next one.   Smart Maple  - slick stationery Pool leather-like pencil case, $5.99 Metal pencil case with latch closures, $7.99 3 x pencil look-alikes ($2.99 each), $8.97 Pork chop character stickers, $1.99   Sogo  - stationery and apparently an unprecedented selection of socks!   Buy 2 get 1 free day!  2 x metal keyholders (fish for me, bone for Sis' friend) 7 x ultra-slim mechanical pencils (in total 9 items each at $1.50, and three were free), $9.00 9 x pairs of socks (3 for $6.99, therefore 3 @ $6.99), $20.97 flashing cell phone holder (Puca character), $6.99   Tokyo Life  - we were so lucky in finding cool items there once but we left again without buying anything   401 Collections  - excellent  car  accessory shop! 3 x CD holders ($2.99 each), $5.98 + tax   CD U CD Me  - clean, bright CD Shop 6 x HK Pop CDs, $20 VCD Movie "Marry a Rich Man", $13    So, now chilling with K in  Green Grove  (ÂÌnÁÖ).  She ordered Yogurt with Milk - Mango flavoured and it tastes a bit like "ye lick doh," this infamous yogurt drink for HK kids and I ordered a watermelon chiller (±ùÉ³) that will take some time to get through.  Sesame toast is so characteristically Chinese (choice of chocolate, strawberry, peanut butter, garlic, or sweetened milk).  (19:45)  Dinner on the top floor of Pacific Mall with K at Ax'ia.  Turns out it's just a Japanese and Korean place and we can't satisfy the craving for Chinese soup noodles today.  Maybe tomorrow.  Okay, for the rest of the shopping trip (frenzy) today:   Some hair accessory / junk jewelry store  clip on earrings that look-alike hoops, $6.90 (Wow-ee, I can wear  earrings  now.  Hoops at that.  I've got to be sure to put my hair up to (1) to show my earrings off and (2) my long hair may get tangled and yank them off!)   Broadcast Books and Gifts  a new "juicy" agenda (Koren), $6.99 + tax B-day card, something + tax "Dog" gift bag, $0.99 + tax  Then we trampled all around the mall looking for the cell phone guy who gave me really tough love last time I had put on my purple face plate and changed my green screen lighting to white and put in an immobilized cartoon.  He hurried me so that I had barely made up my mind and he was taking apart my phone and soldering on new lights.  He wasn't to be found.  Maybe he got caught not charging taxes.  Or maybe he screwed up a phone in his haste.  He had a great selection and such a speedy worker he was!  Settled on Universal Telecom.  Unfortunately couldn't get my backface changed.  :(   Universal Telecome  Translucent purple face, white key pad lights, $50.00  Dinner at  Ax'ia  was blah.  I was just a bit too tired to think of leaving the mall.  K's spicy seafood noodle was spicier than instant noodles and my Korean curry may have been korean and it would have come from a box with Korean writing becausae partway through eating I chomped down on a clump of curry powder.  :|  (22:26)  During the evening, no joke, I thought of the possibility of Pauly calling me this evening and how chances are he'd call me after I had gone to sleep becausae that is why he would find the time and he would know I was definitely in T. by that time.  Surprise - pleasant surprse - he called me when we were just getting in after dinner and we had a really pleasant chat.  We're set to have dinner on Thursday and we will meet at 7:15 PM at Osgood station on Thursay.  The question is: are things going well enough for me to have the guts to ask him about his life?  And do I have the maturity to deal with what he may tell me?  I'm really excited about Thursday becasue he says we are going to a place he knows I like!  Finally, I  love   urlLink MTT  for coming through and providing me (and MTT mobility users) with two-way text messaging.  I don't know what the charge is for long-distance text-messaging but I'm  so  pleased that as long as I'm on  digital  roam, I can still text message with home.    SMS.    Whee!     Day Four (Wednesday, August 28)     (11:20 PM)  I'm home now for the evening.  That's not too exciting, huh?  We walked around a lot, shopping and such downtown Toronto.    First off, we went for dim sum again with Uncle Andrew (&#22823;&#33285;) with Gonggong and Popo.  We went to  New World Palace  (&#26032;&#19990;&#30028;&#30343;&#23448;) at Tempo and Vic. Park.  [Tempo is between Steeles and McNicoll.]  Nice place with some neat chairs with fancy metal backs instead of standard wood "dining room" chairs with tall backs.  Interesting dishes:  Oyster in its shell with green bean vermicelli ,  tapioca and lotus seed paste pudding  that was really rich,  egg white "custard" , and  demi fish-balls with coiled agar (?) vermicelli .  Uncle Andrew was so kind to drive us west to Koreatown at Finch and Yonge.  And so we made our usual pilgramage to  Torontario Gifts , otherwise known to us as "The Morning Glory Store."   Torontario Gifts  red satin quilted "Gorgeous" pencilcase, 7.49 agenda refill - year planner, 1.29 flat violet metal ruler, 2.49 4 x packets Sanrio character ruler/bookmarks ($1.29 each, but two rulers/packet), 5.16 Blue Bear post-it tabs (5 colours), 1.59 Blue Bear post-it tabs (6 colours), 2.59  I also wanted to buy hard-covered notebooks for note-taking.  Very expensive at $9 for something lasting only two subjects.  Maybe I will return....  Sis noted that the Korean ladies always act the same when we got there, watching customers warily when they first enter.  But when they realize you're going to buy a lot of stuff the smiling woman comes up to you politely with a basket to carry your goods.  We then took a subway south to....  Eaton Center .  No groaning.  I just know my way around there so well it's not funny which makes for efficient shopping.  The general plan was to check out clubbing shops first (shops like  Urban Behaviour ,  Costa Blanca ,  Sirens ) and then do casual shopping at  Old Navy .  The kiosks are fun to visit.  Selling Korean stationery, cell phone accessories, and "junk jewelry" are Chinese people and when you have but a small selection, you concentrate more on what you see... like  adorable  Mashimaro plus toys for $9.99.  Maybe on Friday....   Orange Story  - Korean kiosk in Eaton Center 2 x Agenda refills, weekly ($1.69 each) 3.38  I can't believe I bought $30 in fragrances!  They were scents I enjoy anyhow but hardly thought I'd get a chance to purchase.   Promised Land  - nice smelling paraphernalia Smooches body mist, $11.95   Banana Republic Women  Banana Republic W, $20  Last time, I got Primal Desire scent (Cherries and Champagne) at Promised Land so I went for Smooches (strawberries) this time.  All the other scents were smelling too much like air freshener or disinfectant.  :(  Banana Republic's W is wonderful.  Kinda musky and rich-smelling.  A bit like Calvin Klein scent - I hope that's right!   Old Navy  hooded ivory ribbed cardigan, $44.50  I was so excited for a big shopping spree there for  ultra-cheap  casual clothes.  Oh well.  It was neither dirt cheap nor  dressy  casual enough for me.  Choose the ivory colour over black because, well, with my novice laundry skills, the black colour would fade in no time to be unbearably dusty in appearance.  Besdies, my sister said that   the lighter colour you go, the richer you appear  .  (Compare your typical black wool winter coat with one in camel or beige... ~sigh~ me wants it!)  As for clubbing shops, went to (as planned) Costa and Urban Behaviour (ub) that have bascially the same clothes.  Costa is in a state of upheaval so I wonder if it will be there next time.  We even went to the standarnd clubbing shop  le chateau .  I couldn't buy anything there though because it will all arrive in Halifax over the season and a neat multi-texture coat ("leather" front panel, ribbed wool sleeves and back) would be seen all over town with  chateau  stamped all over it.  Ugh, how unoriginal.  So I confined my actual shopping to shops that are not in Halifax.   Urban Behaviour  red "fur"-trimmed quilted jacket, 39.50 camel brown-trimmed oversized-neck turtleneck sweater, 32.50  I've wanted a red quilted jacket for, oh, a few years (and P. would know why) so I wonder if it's not an outdated wish.  (Then saw some by TH at Pseudio and realized it's not all out.)  And the turtleneck sweater?  Well, I adore turtlenecks and camel is a "rich" colour.  :p  I was slightly disappointed to not come home with a really  vampy  top but when you ask me to think up a vampy top I want, I cannot describe one so it is just as well.  We return to Queen Street West on Friday and I can go to  City of Angels , my last resort.    We had dinner at  Marchelino's  (a.k.a. Marche).  There's a bit of a routine to eat there that we were not aware of immediately but got into it.  We can wander around from different stations offering juice, cold salad, hot vegetables, soups, steaks and rotesserie, pasta, baked pasta, stir-fry, pizza, seafood, pastry, bakery, coffee, and desserts.  Before you get a plate to fill up, you get your meal ticket stamped and they calculate how much you ate.  It was difficult to decide on a restricted amount of food (return trips!) and the only annoying part was not knowing just how much you've eaten until you are paying.  Maybe that's why people say it's expensive there!    Dessert at  Plantation  (rather,  Symposium ) at Sheppard Center.  Yum-yum.  Even if it has changed hands, the atmostphere and desserts remain the same.  They have the greatest crepes and waffles although Sis ordered the Mocha Almond Crunch (really rich) and I ordered a chocolate-chocolate sunday (yum).     Day Five (Thursday, August 29)      La Gare  - in Pacific Heritage Town large green hoops silver fish bangle (buy 1 get 1 free), $20   Star Shots  - in Pacific Heritage Town glam shots, $24   Shanghai River Spring Restaurant  - food court of Pacifc Mall dan-dan noodle and hot and hour soup, 2.99 beef ball noodle and chrysanthemum tea, 3.25   New Won Gifts  - in Pacific Mall Blue-eye spot hard-covered notebook, bobbing Mashimaro car ornament, bobbing motorcycler car ornament, all for $10    Chilling at  Ten Ren's  (&#22825;&#20161;) or  Assamiea  in Market Village over Chocolate Mint Iced Milk Tea for me and Chocolate Iced Milk Tea for Sis.  I heard once (P.) that they are the best/most popular choices but it's not quite as sweet as what my Westernized taste buds would truly enjoy.  We also ordered "brick" toast with condensed milk spread.  Mm-yummy.  I mentioned that it's typical Chinese fare because you can also order instant noodles as a main dish.  Go figure.  We got to Pacific Mall really not so early (~11:45am) and not a shop was open.  So we wandered about and about.  We haunted the food court and finally got lunch because Star Shots where we wanted to get pictures taken was not yet open.  Our lunch was ridiculously well-priced.  That's because four shops shoulder-to-shoulder were offering nearly identical main courses.  I wouldn't know if one of the shops had exceptionally more business than the others.  As Sis noted, her bowl of rice noodles with 6 beef balls and complimentary chilled chrysanthemum tea was cheaper than a stand-alone  McGrill sandwich .  My dan-dan noodles in chili and peanut sauce soup and complimentary boal of hot and sour soup was the same price as a  McVeggie burger  alone.  And spicy to leave me rosy for pictures.  The Korean lady at Star Shots is an absolute sweetheart (even if she doesn't open shop until 12:45 PM).  She took three pictures of us and then allowed us to choose which we liked best, a background for our pictures, and package (2 3.5"x5", 4 2"x3.5" and 4 wallet-sized.  All for $24.  As is the usual case, I wasn't the least bit photogenic despite being quite psyched for the photo session.  Photo #1 was crappy for both me and Sis.  In Photo #2 Sis glowed and my eyes were funny.  In Photo #3 I glowed but looked uncomfortable in our back-to-back positions... so we chose #2.  Bittersweet life it is!  So we're just chilling at Ten Ren's until the kind lady is finished touching us up! :)  Next door to Star Shots is a shop selling exclusively cheung sam.  Mom thinks they are gossipy and old-fashioned as full dresses but may think differently of just a shirt.  Spotted me a   vibrant purple cheung sam top with gold embroidery   that is $38.99.  Here's a thought.  It isn't really so novel but sis just suggested an alternative use for clip-on hoops....  like other parts of the ear, nose, lips, (not the eyebrows), belly button, other regions of the body....     Day Six (Friday, August 30)     (0008)  After Ten Ren's, we ransacked Smart Maple and SOGO again at Market Village for cheap pens.  What better place than SOGO for buying two pens at $1.50 each and getting the third one free??   SOGO  3 x character 0.5mm scented pens (2 @ $1.50, 3rd one free), $3 character 0.5 mm scented pen, metal keychain (for K.), fat Snoopy lavendar eraser (2 @ $1.50, 3rd one free), $3  Then we went to retrieve our photos and they were awesome.  We are smashing.  We have more natural beauty (hardly wearing make-up) than many a real Hollywood star.  :D  Next time, K. and I will really coordinate more (matching) make-up and emulate what five girls did and all wear black turtlenecks.  Love the blue background... don't you??  Shopped a bit at  Fairview .  K. bought stuff, I didn't (not original stuff).  No biggie.  I arrived at Osgoode station 45 minutes earrly.  Spent 30 of the minutes sitting in a parkette in the middle of University at Queen Street West cleaning my mind and soul with  Vanity Fair .    Had dinner with Pauly at  Everest , a "fusion" place that serves pizza, Indian, and Tibetian food.  Very comfy and cozy place, candle-lit and P. was not surprised that I headed for the circular booth.  (After a year of not seeing him, you think I was going to let us sit across from each other at a wide table!!)  Upon P.'s suggestion, I ordered Phingsha (green been vermicelli with wood ear and spiced tender chicken and peas searched with basmati rice and pickled carrots).  In the past few days I've ordered what I wanted with certain expectations and consistently been disappointed.  So I just followed his suggestion and was inordinately pleased.  I haven't seen P. in a year and that is a really long time considering I used to see him every day (three years ago) and talked to him everyday in email since I've been in Hali up to three months ago.  I just love how    P. listens to my frustration finding good (and ample) fusion cuisine at home.  P. has mellowed out and stuff he'd turn his nose up at or been irritated about don't bother him anymore.  P. has gotten stronger inside.  he remembers all the things I don't remember and when you put us together, you get the perfect memory.  he accepts me for who I am.  he talks enough and really listens to me.  he is so smart.  he no longer measures success as he used to and I saw tonight for myself his shift from materialism to meaningfulness.  he is so inspiring to work enough for 5 people and constantly exceeds expectations of him.  when I'm not so jealous I can see how "artless" he is, how bewildered he is about the origin of good things happening to him.  we can hug and hold each other platonically now.  he knows so much of my past and I could not possibly let him go because with that knowledge he can give me the most valid suggestions.  he is as wistful as I am of a future that we lost together.    It was a surreal and idyllic ride on the subway from Osgoode to Finch and we talked outside my grandmother's apartment for a bit at the usual place.  Some things don't change while everything else, unfortunately, has.  I miss P.  (1439)    Tea at  Jade Dynasty  at Leslie ("lei see") and Finch.  Unlike the other two restaurants we had been to for dim sum, we just filled out a card with which items we wanted.  Unfortunately we arrived too late in the afternoon to get all that we wanted.  For starters, they had no more  baked egg custard tart  ("dahn tat") or  baked milk custard tart  (that I have never before tried) or roasted duck (for rice noodle with roasted duck) or BBQ Pork.  Drat.  Yummy items of note:  thousand-layer egg yolk cake ,  pan-fried tofu with shrimp ,  dan-dan noodles  (again),  rice noodle stir-fired with black bean sauce  (unlike in Hali when it's laden with green and red peppers I do not like).  Sis said at dim sum we could make a reality tv show out of the chaos from things not going our way.  (2300)  This morning we got up early to see a live taping of  CityLine .  Fun fun.  Got there at  MuchMusic  (or Chum Building or whatever) at 9:30 am as directed and was directed to patio chairs in the third row on level ground.  What the....?  There were two official audience seating areas with upholstered chairs....  I don't know if getting there early was all that was required to get better seating.  Because we were sitting facing the action meaning the cameramen came between us and the hosts and they would need to turn 360 degrees to see us.  The privileged audience members in real chairs sat in tiered seating with mirrors to expand the space.  First thing they did was select a member from the audience for hair and make-up makeover.  I was disappointed that my sister was absolutely unwilling to volunteer for it.  I kind of wanted to (to get onto TV) but quite afraid of the outcome!  I guess she was right because the gray woman they selected who is an administrator at Kraft Canada with three kids got all her hair lopped off and applied in a style that I cannot maintain daily.  It would have been more interesting otherwise, you know.  Otherwise the camera caught us just once as far as I know.  The show itself was okay.  The host Marilyn is an absolute doll on the show and seems a bit colder in real life - it was probably due to her heavy make-up.  It seemed as if Marilyn was directed mostly by one woman who directed everyone else as well.  We were first impored for our "help" as the audience and encouraged to "ooh" and "aah" if something moved us.  (Cheap brown clogs from Zellers moved my sister, and that's about it.)  Finally, we were instructed when to clap so that we would also start into another segment of the show after commercial clapping.  For our efforts we were eligible for a leather jacket draw (didn't win), a complimentary Kenneth Cole metal key fob, a gift certificate for Zellers/The Bay (only $10), and a gift certificate to dfe - Designer Fashion Emporio ($25 off every $100, so we couldn't exactly pool them together).  We were so full from lunch that we refused to budge from home afterwards.  Uncle Simon (Cheungcao) came for dinner that was quite pleasing.  There were a lot of dishes including roasted duck, the crispy skin off a roasted pig ("yuu juu"), and just steamed broccoli.  Whenever I come to Toronto (cable + illegial satellite or something) from Halifax (no cable, no satellite), I have this quandry:   To watch or not watch the Chinese station?    For six days it is quite good.  It is enough time to get addicted to each soap opera showing throughout the day.  And to what end?  Some advancement in my knowledge of Chinese/slang but I doubt it is high because a lot would simply go over my head or in-one-ear-out-the-other.  Mother has arrived and she is trying to infest in me desire to watch Fairchild.  I will have to live without it when I return home - a small painful weaning I would rather avoid.  Besides I  always  suffer from withdrawal upon my return from T.  I can never believe that I'm in Halif for so long (4 or 8 months or a year may fly by, but that is not the sense at the beginning!) and away from....     Day Seven (Saturday, August 31)     My cousin Dann(y) is marrying Tanya Lee Wang (whom I have never met) this afternoon at 3:00 PM (Mountain Time) or 5:00 PM EST.  They have a wedding website  urlLink here .  In other news I hate Toronto water.  I haven't had any major eczema outbreaks when I was back in Hali but ot my first outbreak in T. several years ago and again now.  (1907)    Tea at  Bayview Garden  ("Yee Ming San Jong") in Thornhill at Yonge and Clark.  Yummy.  We got to try out some really different stuff like  marinated duck  in "loe seuy" that our chicken and boiled eggs are usually marinated and on a bed of fried tofu whose skin absorbed the "loe seuy" sauce;  choong yao bao , deep fried green onion cake Bayview Garden-style that is usually just green onions in a slightly burned grilled pancake was a ball of layered pastry and had chinese mushrooms and chicken in it in addition to green onions;  deep fried shrimp dumpling with mango  was shrimp, mango, and mayo in a flat crispy batter;  pan-fried turnip cake  that was surprisingly red-tinged with XO sauce; and  deep-fried stuffed crab claw  that was minced shrimp and crab meat served in batter on a crab claw and deep-fried.  All in all, nifty stuff but it cost us $30 for three people which would have shocked our more thrifty relatives who usually have dim sum for $15 for 3 people.  Then we went grocery shopping at  T&T  ("dai toong wah") which is in the "basement" of Promenade mall at Bathurst and Center.  (I remember going to Promenade with P. once or twice.  I remember once his car was overheating and he was so worried and we gave her a break there.  I remember once we had fender bender just outside Promenade and I was so embarassed at its occurrence.)  The usual frantic shopping for mostly non-perishable goods either unavailable or unfresh in Hali or ridiculously marked up.  The trip always starts out fun and we are clustered with our mother who stops to look at everything in a store the same size as any mega-sized Superstore.  Then our interest always wanes as we have been there for two hours or more.  It would be a foreign idea to us to have a "small" trip to the Chinese grocery which would be the case if we actually lived here and I found myself sadly forgoing a loaf of black sesame break because I cannot eat it all before I leave and we just don't bring fresh bread back home.  I feel a bit sad because I remember... shopping with my cousin W. (now in England and destined to stay there forever) with his father Uncle Andrew just before a Waterloo term.... shopping for myself when I lived here on a weekly or biweekly basis and buying for two people.... did I ever shop with P. in a Chinese market?....  always I never fathomed that I would be leaving.  Our grocery total, get this, came to $604.51.  The cashier girl punched in the cash amount I handed her - $605.00 - and the computer responded with "Amount too large" message and her supervisor was called over to authorize entering that amount.  :p  (2345)    Dinner at  Memories of Japan  at Don Mills and south of Lawrence.  I recall that I was introduced to the place by my fashionable aunt Christine.  Therefore it is good because she gets around to a lot of restaurants.  Unfortunately the food was not so good today.  My sister and I each ordered Sashimi Osaka - 6 kinds of fish - and Mom ordered Sushi Tokyo - 6 kinds of fish, 3 tuna rolls, 3 cucumber rolls, and a tuna hand roll.  It seemed as if they had run out of tuna because the tuna rolls were all salmon.  And I had only 5 kinds of fish (surf clam, red snapper, tuna, salmon, and artifical crab meat).  It was forgiveable because we got 5 instead of 3 salmon (yummy!) and 4 instead of three pieces of crab.  Unfortunately, the fish was not satisfactory.  Tuna was too thick and non-descript.  Red snapper was tasting like disinfectant.  Only the salmon was perfectly satisfactory.  We also ordered a beef sashimi and I hope that I can remember that Memories of Japan still has the best beef sashimi I've ever had.  My theory is that we went for dinner too late (~9:00 PM) and so our food was discernibly not as fresh.  I hope that is the only explanation and next time is better - we usually only make one sushi trip and I would prefer it to be good!  As we were driving to Memories, we passed by a little house that appears to be a business.  P., do you remember Christmas dinner with your colleages when you were working at Alcatel?  I remember the atmostphere and the specially-prepared specialty coffees that were so strong!  It never ceases to amaze me the DVP ( Don Valley Parkway ) and the (flow of) traffic on it.  Once upon a time someone told me that it is more crazy driving on the DVP than the infamous 401 that carries you across Toronto and beyond in easterly and westerly directions.  By contrast the DVP is a direct route from sprawling suburbia in the north (Richmond Hill where I wouldn't mind living and beyond) through to downtown Toronto.  So it is as vital as the 401 but... different, more  posh .  And so it makes me feel wistful.     Day Eight (Sunday, September 1)     (22:24)  Tea (again) at  Bayview Garden  only today in Richmond Hill ("Leet zee mun sahn") as opposed to Thornhill ("Hong sahn").  This location is not quite as nice.  Oh well.  Items of note: sis ordered  mini octopus  of which she ate about ten and I pinched shut my eyes and ate 2;  marinated duck  we liked so much yesterday we ordered it again but it wasn't so good this time around; and  baked rice with seafood with cream sauce  mmm, we weren't going to get it otherwise this trip.  Some shopping with grandparents and so forth in Richmond Hilll.  The highlight would have been cruising down Highway 7 to Wal-mart in the rental car.  In only a small way I look forward to being 25 and being able to rent a car in my name at  any  car rental place.    Finally, dinner at  "Foo Gwei Lao"  on Old Kennedy Road.  Getting there was a chore.  I was driving only because I was assured that Mom had good directions for how to get there.  She was the only one in the car who would recognize the sign (the characters of the name).  She may have been told that it was not in the same area as  Hot Pot King  that has a very big and bright sign.  Uncle Simon swore that his directions indicated otherwise.  So we circled around exploring roads other than Old K. and arrived at the Hot Pot plaza finally late and disgruntled.  Apparently this restaurant is quite popular for their  "doong gwah zhong" , winter melon soup in the melon for $40.  They also serve  Beijing-style duck  and the  dish you eat in a lettuce wrap .  You see, as the youngest generation, my sister and I are not expected to contribute to dinner time conversation.  If there were enough of us  kids  and adults, we'd be sitting at different tables.  To my surprise, then, Uncle S. condescended to ask me some questions that the older generation could not answer and they were burning his bachelor, engineering brain: like if my hair colour is permanent, if new hair grows in that colour, how much and how often to dye and retouch.  It was quite funny to be called to contribute for that!  Dinner was okay.  An awful lot of seafood in the set dinner and the added scallop dish.  I think I found it boring because aside from the novel soup, we had fried and stirred fish on vegetables, beef on vegetables, steamed chicken alone, and shrimp on vegetables.  The additional dish was scallop on vegetables.  Ugh.  At family dinners I can get away with not eating, or just picking the non-meat items and they were remarkably the same across all the dishes tonight.     Day Nine (Monday, September 2)     Went for drinks with P. La tonight, my last night (morning) in T.    P. recommended a place to me near Sheppard and Yonge called  Koto Tea House  as having the best bubble tea in town.  Fortunately, it didn't require more than one instance of retracing our steps to find the place on the west side of yonge between Sheppard and the 401 exits.  The girl forgot to bring us the drinks.  But she did not neglect to bring us food.  Pan-fried green onion cake.  Mm.  Crispy and aromatic.  When the bubble tea did arrive (green apple milk tea with bubbles), I had to agree that the pearls were well done and no complaints about the tea at all.  Going to the same haunt as P. makes me sad and mad and wistful and temerously triumphant all at once.  P. still has a purple Manica car air freshener in his car and he hasn't replaced it because who gave it to him....?  So I will not rip out my black Manica either and keep refilling it.  Winnie the Pooh pajamas that I gave him (and do not recall now) are in a sad state... new Christmas present?  And an alarm clock I gave him more recnetly is broken by no fault of mine (in choosing the quality) but by his own accident completely.  I have so much I could sent you, P., through our snail-mail correspondance!  (2109)  On a train today again.  What a circus of a day!  Spent the morning packing and wrapping boxes of food in brown parcel wrapping paper until we had a car full of boxes of food.  One of our suitcases came in at 70 lb.s which we thought was not a problem because only baggage exceeding 75 lb.s was prohibited.  Drove us down to the train station on a route involving 3 highways only because I thought I had the route down cold.  Didn't actually have the route down and exited prematurely so I only travelled on 2 haighways.  This cause some unnecessary chaos in my car but my mother - out of lack of interest - does not retain information on Toronto roadways in her head.  Have I mentioned before looking forward to driving for myself in T. at another time??  Hauling all the baggage about the station (7 pieces and miscellaneous carry-ons) was a workout for the day.  We learned of a  hidden clause  regarding baggage exceeding 50 lb.s is subject to a $15 surcharge (and flat-out prohibited it if exceeds 75 lb.s).  We squabbled at the counter.  I regretted the expenditure of $15 out of the blue and Mom and sis and I wavered between not wanting to bother unpacking the incriminiting suitcase of 23 lb.s and geneourlys forking over $15 to VIA and claiming it was no big deal to transfer some things over to a cloth bag.  Our decision was made when we learned that the surcharge for that blessed piece of baggage was $15  per train  and we are taking a second train out of Montreal.  $30 was quite persusasive in encouraging ten minutes of repacking and reshuffling!  To our utter and total dismay, the Toronto-Montreal train we boarded was nowhere as nice as the Montreal-Toronto train we took.  Today's train - eww - smelled like pee.  I regret a lot not taking a picture in the other train and we conjecture its use was for the overnight rides between Montreal and Toronto and not for the day ride we had.  Suffered through that train and arrived at Montreal just to board another train.  The overnight train to Hali from Montreal is identical to last time.  A difference lies in that we are traveling as a group of three and hence can occupy a facing 4-seater and spread out at night.  Dinner was better (ordered steak again).    I think that with the presence of Mother, we (at least I) can bear the grossness of train-riding that much more  .  And now back to totally indulgent  Vanity Fair  reading.  :)     Day Ten (Tuesday, September 3)     Passed the most miserable night on the train because I am miserably sick.  While the train honked in the middle of the night over train / traffic crossings, so did I.  I have one more item to chat about that is a different in attitude these days being in Chinese places but will have to get to it after this is transcribed and enjoy the last half hour of this journey that we can see  civilization  upon re-entering Halifax!

          Happy Birthday to P. :) :) :)       miss gadgets    poor me. and i mean it literally.  i'm drooling over the new palm pilot (tungsten T) and if i am to finally get a PDA, that's the one i want....    went jogging yesterday and i guess i was careless because my 10-second anti-skip really didn't cut it.  i want to take a 45-second anti-skip for a trial run and see if it is really "skip-free."  it's not like i'm racing with my music, but i couldn't tell if i hadn't accidentally cheated on my laps because my music was just skipping so much it hadn't played as much as it would usually have played by that lap number.  funny, huh?  for a jogger you think that md player (smaller) or mp3 player would be a better idea but i'm more practical-oriented, you know.  mp3 player is a hassle because if i liked a song enough, it's on an audio cd somewhere, and they don't hold enough in a small ultra-portable device nor is it worth the $$ just yet.  md players... so pretty but hassle again to copy over cds and stuff.  nopers....  i want a new phone (even though i really like my "toy" phone right now - nokia 6185i all "souped up" with a clear violet face plate, white-lit keypad - that sadly drains my battery but a great night light! - and a pochacco transparency in back) but my grumbling of mtt (and bell, for that matter) is that they carry the neatest phones (nor do they give you the great discounts on phones as rogers does).  and then i want a digital camera.  cuz i take really lousy pictures (both as a photographer and subject) and so i need second tries on everything.  advantix film is really expensive to buy and develop.  :(

         chinese food    My mother returned on Wednesday from Toronto.  She went there for a dinner in honour of the new marriage of my cousin Dann and my new cousin Tanya.  Do you know what that means?    Food!    Lots and lots of it from Big Land in Toronto.  That also means getting really stuffed the first few days she got back (imagine me having to be rolled out of the dining room) because some stuff she brought back were fresh like chinese vegetables, fresh rice noodles, roasted duck and "young" roasted pork.  She nearly captured the original bakery's smell in boxes and certainly bought one of every thing (that we like).  Big Land is directly connected to food suppliers so they also have new stuff which means we always have new stuff - contrast with the local chinese groceries who seem to have not changed their supply order form in decades and only order in the same ole hackneyed stuff.  For example, on Chinese radio this instant noodle my mother picked up comes in innovative packages for two (single-packed instant noodles assume you eat alone!!) and the noodles are not fried before they get to you but baked... like baked chips, they are healthier for you!  Apparently it's all the rage in HK, they can't keep it in stock.  All I can say is Yay for Mom! and Toronto and constantly innovative Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food suppliers!  It's nice to feel like our finger is still on the pulse of things even if we're cast into dire backwater country.  This all means one thing: I have to go jogging as diligently this coming week (at least twice) as I did last week!

         (frilly) f5        What is your favorite scary movie?   I don't have one.  I don't usually voluntarily watch movies that make me scared (I've usually been tricked or didn't know).   Seven  was an awesome movie but I didn't see all of it (hiding), and I thought  Signs  was really good as well.   What is your favorite Halloween treat?   Rocket candy, by far, and exclusively.   Do you dress up for Halloween? If so, describe your best Halloween costume.   Not since I've been very young.  My favourite costume was a "princess."  Gee, what a surprise.  But it was never really original outfits....  One year (the first year) I did that, I wore the white dress I wore as a little flower girl.   Do you enjoy going to haunted houses or other spooky events?   No.  Haven't been to one worth mentioning.   Will you dress up for Halloween this year?   Not this year.  There are a handful of costume ideas I would like to realize... but not this year.    You know it's been a crappy few weeks when nothing of interest is posted except friday fives....  This week's is frilly and easy to answer, thank goodness.

         f5       How many TVs do you have in your home?   Two.  One in my father's room and one in the living room-cum-family room.   On average, how much TV do you watch in a week?   Four hours give or take half an hour.  I'm quite fanatic about   Alias   and complain about it as much as I like it;   Charmed   about three good-looking kick-ass sister witches;   Enterprise  , the latest installment of the Trek family; and (unfortunately!) the weekly fix of   Friends   and   Will & Grace  .  I hate myself for watching the last two shows....   Do you feel that television is bad for young children?   Some shows are geared towards children's education and if they are being drawn in to interact with some fuzzy character it's marginally okay.  But a lot of other stuff is inappropriate for children but freely available to them.   What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken?   No heartbrokeness over a stupid show!  Not even when   Felicity   was still on.   If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like?   A rotating line-up consisting of my current favourite shows, re-runs of Felicity, Star Trek (any of the different shows), and Babylon Five!

         it's been a bloody, stinkin' week    since i last wrote.  what can i say?  i have an algos midterm later on today and so all desire to really party it up and indulge have gone out the window.  hey, i still want to party (but don't) and indulge (and do).  so it was just manifested in being extraordinarily lazy about updating my blog!  A.'s girlfriend came up to me yesterday when i was talking to T. and she said, "winnie, can i talk to you for a minute?"  don't know but i must have had this guilty conscience because my mind immediately began to wonder what i had done wrong and fear what this girl had to say to me!!  apparently A.'s noticed that i haven't talked to him for a while and it's true.  i used to just sit down with him while he's playing on a computer and talk for 15 minutes or half an hour.  funny that he thought that his gf had something to put me off to scare me away from talking to him so she had to come to me to set things straight or to find out the real story.  i just fancy myself to be busy and i really do want to talk to him!!  two things:  (1)   if i'm going to cease to talk to someone, they're going to know it  ; especially after this confrontation, i'm giving A. my biggest smiles until i do have the opportunity to talk to him again so he shouldn't worry; and (2) i sat down with A.'s gf (it's so sweet how she moved here and started to come to school here this year!!) and it's like a revolution in me to want to be friends with the gf.  it's so   refreshingly naturally girlish  .  from her strong and healthy relationship with A. she's got so much she can share with little ole me - oh, it could have been more fun than talking to A. himself!  :p  so algos midterm is later on today.  there is also an assignment due and i'm completely in my element.  i can explain things in  two  languages.  take that.  :p  there's a grad student who realized the opportunity she had and she emailed to the class list two days before the midterm and stated that she took the course two years earlier with the same prof and got an A+.  she was also marker a year earlier for the same prof.  rates were something like $20/hour per one student.  she had rates for 2, 3, 4, up to 10 or 20 students as  low  as $12/hour.   wow-ee.   if i charged something for every grade-A explanation i've been giving out....  but hey, it's not only not ethical, i think i'm still riding the mutual-benefit wave and that i even if i'm giving away to someone who needs me, i can get some explanation from someone who can help me in return.    being stingy would cause a break in the "study" chain   and i wouldn't want to do that!  wish me luck on algos midterm.  wish me not needing any luck at all!  ;)

         f5    Ooh, a chance to show that I've had some cultural influences in my life....!      If you could only choose 1 cd to ever listen to again, what would it be?  Gimme a classical CD and I can't decide which one right now!    If you could only choose 2 movies to watch ever again, what would they be?  Anne of Green Gables (version by Kevin Sullivan) and Little Women (old version with Elizabeth Taylor)    If you could only choose 3 books to read ever again, what would they be?  Anne of Green Gables (childhood favourite), Little Women (the books are much better!), and the Bible.    If you could only choose 4 things to eat or drink ever again, what would they be?  Mapo tofu (tofu and minced pork in chili sauce), fettucine alfredo, sake sashimi (raw slabs of Atlantic salmon), and stewed beef brisket with carrots.    If you could only choose 5 people to ever be/talk/associate/whatever with ever again, who would they be?  Well, that's easy: my  parents, my sister, P., and my long-distance pal, Y. that it would take the rest our lives to catch up and share cuz we haven't seen each other in so long!       false advertising and a steakhouse i can enjoy    tried to go to   taj mahal   because the server the last time said that hakka-chinese food is only served friday at lunch.  turns out friday luncheon is buffet only (i've had it before) and it may or may not have a hakka-chinese dish.  didn't even bother because stuffing myself in the name  of maximizing $11.95 was not in the plan so we headed for   hamachi steak house  , a spin-off of my favourite japanese restaurant in the city: hamachi house.  tried a couple of times to go to the steak house as well.  one time, it was closed (as it usually is) on weekends at lunch.  the next time, it was open, but perusing the menu posted outside, i decided it was way too expensive (upwards of $18) for a teppanaki dinner.  it's been years since there has been teppanaki grilling in hali!  we started with vegetable gyozas (5 for $6) served with dipping sauce.  they were good and since i popped my two in my mouth without looking to see what was in them, i can continue to think that the pasty interior was  not  just vegetables.  i ordered a chicken and shrimp combination teppanaki ($10) that comes with a fair amount of chicken and two shrimps.  the chicken was cooked in "special sauce" that tasted just like soya to me... and i'm not a fan of just-soya taste.  the shrimps were excellent - crunchy, and tasty.  i saw the chef prepare them in lemon, soya sauce, and butter.  it was served with steamed japanese rice and a pile of grilled vegetables (cabbage, onions, carrots, and red cabbage).  S. ordered salmon teppanaki ($11).  it was prepared in the same sauce as my shrimp but he got a whole slab of it, so i was jealous!  his was very yummy.  he also ordered fried rice, which we also saw the chef preparing on the grill for $2 extra.  i was quite happy with the steamed rice that didn't compete in flavour with the  grilled food.  a group of swiss people sitting at the same grill all ordered medium striploin teppanaki and that looked really yummy all cubed and not too well-done on the grill sizzling in some flambed cooking wine.  the salmon and striploin are what i want to try next time for lunch!  all in all, it was fun.  hamachi has this thing for hip settings and so the steakhouse has this cool decor but it's also this traditional style of cooking.  dinnner there is more than i can afford, but lunch was decent priced.  i surely like my japanese food raw better but it is nice to have this added option for eating in the city!   (four point five / five)

         A L I A S kicks ass    really, really liked tonight's episode of Alias.  it affected me inexplicably.  sydney bristow's biological mother is a dangerous russian spy who just turned herself in to the CIA and while they are happy to keep her, they don't know what to make of her.  Irina is like the mother from hell who is really slick at the same time.  i mean, sydney is kick-ass spy extraordinaire after a year at it (and supposedly juggling grad studies at the same time) so her mother who left her when she was a child and doing it for twenty-odd years must have been a cool, non-chalant professional.  (well, syd also has a spy-daddy so she's doubly gifted.)  i totally went goggly-eyed for syd's love interest Vaughn (played by Michael Vartan, i saw him first!) when i saw him in ally mcbeal as the son in a father-and-son duo simultaneously (and unknowingly) wooing miss ally.  he's such a cutie but not too cool and unemotional when he's around Irina who blew his father to beyond recognition.  first she catches him referring to sydney by her first name, and his expression following her point this out doesn't require a spy to figure out he's feeling guilty.  then when he's got his back turned to her and trying to walk away before betraying being affected, she intimates that she knows what's under his skin (that she killed his father) by telling him that he looks a lot like his father.  i guess this fascination (besides getting to see syd every week in a couple of really trendy outfits i dream of being daring enough to wear) with totally cool spies goes a bit back.  P. would know and especially understand my fascination with Irina - the mother of all spies (pun intended).  i just hope that the writers don't let me down when it comes to Irina!

         (sorry) tim's & a turkish delight    a really  student  kind of day, if i can say so....  in the early afternoon (before getting down to work), i found myself walking out of wal-mart with a huge clothes dryer (white metal wire contraption with wings on which you hang your non-dryer clothes to dry) and strolling through dollarama with other res girls picking up personal items on the cheap.  :p  i liked pretending i'm doing all-important household shopping and stuff....  then got a soup & bagel deal at Tim's that i totally advocate for a not-heavy lunch kind of meal.  i got a toasted multigrain bagel (should have gotten plain) with butter and a cream of broccoli soup.  in a "meal deal" you get $0.75 off the items for ordering them together.  funky choice of bagel aside (multigrain has those inappropriate grain bits that are sweet-ish), the soup was strange-tasting.  no flavour, and a scary yellow hue.  and then when i was nearly done the soup, i crunched down on something.  hmm, i thought, thinking i must have dropped a piece of bagel in and i don't know what possessed me to spit out whatever crunched and then i don't know what possessed me to look down and see what it was.  it was a big black fly!  needless to say i lost my appetite immediately and swear not to get soup from them for a while, despite the fact it was my comfort refuge all last summer every day at lunch.   most  of the time it is comfortable as if going back home for lunch....  can't afford the turkish restaurant that is   anatolia   but what luck that the they thought to open up a small stand called   turkish delight   on spring garden that serves lamb doners and chicken doners, a novelty to this town, i'm sure.  so i've been dying to try the place out because, please, chicken is a lot healthier than the mystery and very salty meat that is in "meat" doners. the two guys running the shop were really friendly (hence my delight) and their menu quite sparse.  i ordered about half of it with an order each of small chicken and lamb-beef doner ($4.50 each), and an order of cacik ("chachik", $3.00) that is yoghurt with cucumber, mint, and olive oil -- my thinking: tzatziki.  by the luck of the draw i ended up with the lamb-beef and didn't like it an awful lot because it was pretty dry.  i tried the chicken and it was better, especially given i'm fond of "crappy" (dark meat) chicken.  they add a "red" (slightly spicy) sauce that i was initially scared contained coriander... but it doesn't.  so i wouldn't mind going back: chivarous guys serving you, stuffed pitas with healthier meat and infinitely more affordable than the restaurant that spawned the shop!

          i H A T E computers    Ironic, isn't it?  But even way back when I have been wary of installing too many small programs on my computer(s) having only a faint idea of what's going on in my registry and DLL's - what I perceive to be sensitive and vulnerable and important parts of my computer!  Ironically it wasn't installing small rogue software that has screwed up my desktop so it's just an idiotic non-functional box (and a big one at that) but that I was trying to get Windows to accept me setting up a direct cable connection so the desktop could play host to my laptop for file transfer.  It  so  did not work out.  :(  It reminded me of what a   waste of time   messing around with your computer is so when nothing's wrong, I don't mess with mine.  All I wanted to do was watch B5 this afternoon because I don't have lectures to attend (special thing this Friday)....  (A little bit of background information:  Bought my Dell laptop online and it's great.  The DVD-ROM does not work for most DVD's and then it completely ceased to work.  I know that Dell will not service my computer with XP on it because I did not buy it with XP and installed it myself after I bought it.  So, before taking XP off, I have to backup my files to my desktop, which would be ultra-convenient by ftp.  The installation of Direct Cable Connection seems to have messed up my desktop computer.  Therefore no CD-ROM drive available for either computer....)

         f5 & b5        What size shoe do you wear?   Depends.  From my "kid shoes" at size five to everything else at size 6.5.    How many pairs of shoes do you own?   In active use and belong to me (I also borrow my from sister)?  Three pairs   boots  , three pairs   sneakers  , two pairs   loafers  , four pairs black   sandals  , one pair   thongs  , one pair   ballet shoes  ....  Fourteen.    What type of shoe do you prefer (boots, sneakers, pumps, etc.)?   I prefer good boots that are comfortable over sneakers only because I'm too short in sneakers.  However, my new running shoes are so heavenly comfortable!!    Describe your favorite pair of shoes. Why are they your favorite?   Three-way favourite: (1) the cutest pair of "kid" brown boots that are size 5 and make my feet look darling; they are the perfect incline with not a overwhelming (platform) kind of front that give me deisred elevation without pain; most of all, I can no longer conceive of wearing light pants except with brown shoes!  (2) square-toed black boots with a 3.5" heel and no elevation in the front make for the most painful boots I have ever owned; but when you see me from the side, you can see the heel is dramatically thin and makes an awesome line; but it doesn't cease to hurt, can't help hurting even if they are good, costly shoes, because of the incline; and (3) new black chunky loafers that aren't too chunky; in which I can show off my darling collection of kids' socks; they are comfortable and elevating; I think I'm growing up and getting sensible - horrors!    What's the most you've spent on one pair of shoes?   $150 for black leather lace-up boots that go up to my knees!  Although I got them from a good store (Aldo), they aren't  that  good because I think the $150 covers both quality and material.    Sorry about the spiel on shoes!  It's just that I strongly believe that   if my feet get tired, that (unfortunately) goes straight to my head and makes the rest of my body tired, too  .  Then are the diva-shoes worth it?  Used to be I was ever-increasingly going towards stilletos and scorning girls who couldn't get past their conservatism and chunky black shoes but here I am reverting to chunky black shoes that aren't that sexy at all.  While they might do it out of their natural sensibility and lack of desire to be provocative, I've been forced to this unwitting sensibility because my feet are starting to strike against me.  My quest: To scour expensive shoe boutiques for the most comfortable and   diva   sandals and boots and buy them!  Okay.  b5???  I just received in the mail b5 (Babylon 5) and LOTR (  Legend of the Rangers  ) from a dear, dear friend of mine.  But I'd really like to let P. (the sender) know that I will really try to get to watching them but I'm notoriously bad for not watching movies and getting distracted.  I have rented and started watching but never finished Ideal Husband, New Waterford Girl, Erin Brokovich, and countless other good movies because I got a phone call or went online, etc.  I would  really  usually rather do something than sit in front of a television in the living room watching the "idiot box."  Call it a Wynism  (We have hope because these are CDs and hence I can watch in my room and do something else....)  In any case, I wanted to acknowledge receipt and thank so very much P. for remembering us watching b5!  I remember how much he liked watching it and how I became interested, too, on account of him!  :)

         neuro computing & life beyond school    We were instructed to read a chapter from the textbook that gives non-neuroscience students an introduction to a single neuron, features of it, and (as far as I have read - I didn't do all of my reading assignment!) the generation of an action potential.  During class today, it was "discussion" (turned into a lecture) of the reading we had done.   And  I found that it was quite satisfying to be in a science lecture again.  You see, this morning I had to attend a seminar that include presentations given by several Computer Science professors wherein they outlined their research interests by way of giving new graduate students an idea of who is doing what in the faculty.  I thought that I would be most intrigued by the work presented today (databases, data mining, information retrieval,  health informatics ) but alas I was disappointed.  To me... projects like filtering information from the Internet is for those who are anxious in advancing the technology, for the benefit of Internet users.  For CS geeks.  Health informatics projects on the go are "administrative" (pardon my misuse of the word) and while I am concerned about the improvements to healthcare that solutions health informaticians will bring, I would be more interested in advancing actual scientific knowledge.  So, I know that we covered in "neuro" [computing] class today was really basic, doesn't even get to complex models, but it still made me more excited.  Almost unafraid to tackle the murky unknown to me that is applied math.  That's what gets me going -- more than filtering electronic news, more than scaling web pages down for handheld devices, and certainly more than issues arising from changing mid-session from viewing a webpage on a hand-held device to a desktop, more than categorizing medical journal articles using artifical intelligence or creating personalized health information pages (though the last two were most intriguing of the lot).  I can see that these are problems arising from burgeoning data that is being inefficiently used or represented and we have to quickly (but wisely) use it or it is waste.  I just have preferences for which knowledge I am using.  And that's the point, right?  To be doing something you're interested in.  Something you see the meaning to doing.  I learned from working in an IT department that I do care about whether or not what I do is lasting.  I don't see the personal reward in solving a bureaucratic problem.  I surprise myself because I never thought I would sound so idealistic but it only comes after being scared of... being normal.

         e e p !    it seems that my family's insurance expires tonight at midnight and since our current insurer has rejected the entire family for renewal, we are without at midnight.  it could be just me but it seems kind of ironically funny....  no worries, i have no fear that once mom finishes the accounting that is now preoccupying her such that we didn't get seamless insurance, she'll figure something out.  maybe for the few days we are uninsured, we'll just drive only when there is absolutely no one on the road... like head for school at 6 a.m. and head for home at 11 p.m.....

         School O / C    A little while ago (back in the summer) I had a post listing some observed obsessive-compulsive habits I have when studying.  Things have to be  just right  for me to feel comfortable.  Then yesterday, while talking to my sister and S., and what seemed to be really normal to me and my sister were apparently... really odd.  So, when someone passes a judgment like so, I think said habits qualify as a Wynism.  You see, in my Algorithms class, the professor puts online lecture notes that we dutifully print off before the lecture and follow and scribble down board notes he deliberately omits so that we do have something to do during class.  Well, it seems that most everyone just shoves the hand-annotated notes back into their bag and forget about them until time to do the assignment then out they come for some confused referral.  What I do, which seems to be totally contrary to popular practice is to recopy the lecture notes into my notebook and while doing so integrate the board notes at the appropriate points.  I see this system as having some very attractive advantages like   generating a set of homogenous notes formatted to my liking   (poor prof is in the midst of translating his HTML notes to something more amenable to math symbols and equations but not quite done yet) and I get to do what is so desirable that is to go over the notes after a lecture to take the time to learn the stuff.  Is that such a foreign idea??  Apparently....  I guess the common attitude of CS-ers taking Algorithms is that it's a "math" course and pretty much for them every course is "applied" and so they believe in  understanding  material and not regurgitation which I wasn't so fond of doing in science but apparently can't seem to deviate from the style of even with my new career!  I cannot simply sit back in a lecture and "absorb" because I really wonder how much actually gets absorbed you're passively sitting.  Meanwhile, I'm writing like mad every insinuation the professor has to offer because I'm aiming to have as many   learning epiphanies   as possible -- during the lecture, while making notes, while doing an assignment, while studying for midterms, and again while studying for finals....  We aren't so strange are we....?    Recent visit to Taj Mahal    That's an Indian restaurant in Halifax, by the way.  That place freaks me out more than a little and just stepping into it, I wanted to go to any other Indian restaurant in Hali because I think the decorations there are overdone and sinking into tackiness.  For example, we sat at a booth that was really anciently upholstered but you can't tell because the place is kept dim.  Running behind the booths was a platform and on display was a gold statuette of a Buddha and running at the foot of the statuette was a strip of blue light that cast an eerie glow on the sacred figure.  That aside....  The server was a bit horrific, but that's just me getting ultra-picky in the situation.  There has been advertised outside the restaurant the introduction of Hakka-Chinese food but it was not on the menu and I learned to my dismay that it is only served on Fridays at lunch so... guess I'll have to make another visit regardless of my impressions.  Taj is the only place here that serves Hakka-Chinese.  We ordered mulligatawny for me and something-something shorba for S.  S-s shorba was simply chicken corn chowder that my parents refuse to cook for me because it's just not an expensive soup (but the most expensive soup on Taj's menu).  S-s shorba was spiced up (thanks to ginger) and so it was quite tasty.  I have to severely beware because the mulligatawny had not only crushed pieces of ginger in profusion but also an unacceptable hint of coriander.  Shivers and :(.  I never got my pampadom that I ordered....  For entree I ordered chicken korma (hmmm... reddish curry) while S. ordered a mixed seafood platter that I cannot comment on but for it's price ($25) and that it came on a sizzling platter.  Korma is my favourite and except for some surprises (I don't know what they were, but they weren't bad), it wasn't altogether unpleasant.  Because of a large-ish party that arrived before we did and because of another group that sat down after we did but got food first delaying our order, the waitress told us that the head chef sent along a complimentary dish (worth $11.95) of biryani (essentially fried rice with curry and some meat).  Right... which is likely to mean that they screwed something up in the kitchen and would have thrown it out or recycled it several hours from then.  It was not totally welcome and was largely uneaten (I didn't try any because I felt slighted by it all).  I still want to try Hakka-Chinese there (and ask carefully if there is coriander in any of the dishes!) but having to dodge mines (coriander that I despise), so it felt, made the dinner quite... stressful and add to it horrific service and lengthy delay.  I mean, the place touts itself as so good but I simply have to disagree and say that I favour the smaller, and even the newer Indian restaurants in town.   (three point five / five)

         "there is a dysfunction amongst graduate students"    we had a stimulating discussion in our AI class (not about AI) on thursday about the state of courses in my faculty.  i was really pleased to be able to make a contribution and provide some insight from my own experiences that come from coming from a different faculty.  there is some imbalance when it comes to course offerings in the last year of undergrad studies that i never noticed before - mostly because i never had to select a fourth-year curriculum for myself and just skipped along to grad school (cool).  that was when i realized that the CS faculty as a whole doesn't offer cross-listed 4rth-year/grad courses like those i experienced (6 of them) in my last year of biochem.  in biochem/chem they were a tailspin that i fondly remember these days.  in three courses, grad students and undergrads did exactly the same work.  in a lab techniques course and organic reaction mechanisms, that was just the way of the syllabus.  in bioinformatics, it was an accident due to the month-long strike in the winter term.  in proteins, grads had to write two extra essays over the four the undergrads did.  in x-ray crystallography, grads had more challenging assignments to tackle.  finally, in organic spectroscopy, grads actually did less when they did not have to take part in the lab sessions using the spectrometers!  these days when i'm really feeling under pressure, i remind myself that i've been subject to this level of study  and  work before and with hard work that sometimes i cannot remember myself putting in, i got past those times with decent marks so i can certainly do it again!  it's the end of term and so once again some fretting about selecting courses for next term.  funny how it was nearly a brain-dead decision in undergrad.  i knew what i was interested in and it was there.  i got into the classes i registered for.  the former-chair of graduate studies is the AI prof and said the above about us very carefully.  he meant to say that grad students will sign up for the maximum number of courses they can take a term, fill up all the slots in tiny grad classes as soon as you are allowed to start registering online and hog five spots in five classes when they only intend to take three in the end.  grrr.  i was seriously slammed in the beginning of this term by this kind of mentality but it's the way of the shark pond so you gotta do the same to keep your space!    china    there is some guy's  urlLink recap  of his recent trip to china (look for entries Nov. 19 & 20).  in a succint way, it was quite a funny read - and some pictures, too!  ~sigh, if i could go, there'd be a visual feast afterwards!

I think it still works.  It hurts to go down memory-lane so I don't often visit it, and it's very archaic by now!   urlLink Headlands  - I'm mentioned in this little links page and I wonder how long ago this page was created... looks very archaic too!   urlLink Blog II  - how did they index this one?

         il mercat    i have been wanting to go to   il mercato   for a while now....  there's something about it's central location on spring garden road and we always pass by it and there are always people lingering near the door as if they are waiting for a table to leave so that they may sit down for dinner.  it turns out we didn't have to wait for long at all and were seated nearly immediately in a center kind of two-person table.  it's alright.  you feel like you're in the midst of a bustling italian afresco bistro by night with the earthy-orange walls with black-and-white framed pictures of italian history and a water fountain in the center(ish) of the room.  a little bit of background: il mercato is the poorer sibling of   da maurizio   and owned by the same people who own posh, snotty   bish  .  il mercat serves "northern italian" cuisine for what it's worth.  since we trekked from school amidst a thin layer of snow on the ground, it was intensely pleasing to be in a warm and cozy restaurant.  the last time i was there could have been two years ago and i think it was the very same exuberant waiter.  not my style, but really great - i'm sure other people rave about him.  especially after he gave detailed re-heating instructions to a woman next door for her to-go pasta and referred her to the italian market for ingredients.  just for ordering food, they brought four slices of foccoccia in a wire basket amidst white cloth and we made use of the mysterious (n+1)st plate on the table (where n is the number of guests) when the server drizzled balsamic vinegar and olive oil on it for us.  it was great.  S. didn't know what he was eating until i informed him - it's fun to enlighten my dinner company and show my prowess with non-asian cuisine!  for appetizers we ordered risotto croquettes (3 crunchy balls filled with rice and some sauteed vegetables sitting in a puddle of bruschetta-like vegetables paste) ($7.95) and the soup-of-the-day cream of sweet potato with mussels.  the risotto croquetters were delightful bites - i love risotto rice and bruschetta and they go well together!  likewise the soup was delicious even if i could not quite figure out where the sweet potato came in except to give it colour.  it was sprinkled generously with some green herbs and served with five mussels in their shell.  for the main course, i ordered ravioli filled with roasted chicken in a wild mushroom sauce with (oh dear, can't spell) boccononi.    il mercat is the kind of place where you would go specifically for dessert and they do get that sort of business.  case in point: the last time i was there, we were dissatisfied with food we got at the   cellar (bar and grill)   and so we ended the evening with desserts from il mercat.  all throughout dinner my eyes would fall on the great antipasto and dessert display.  towering scrumptious cakes, fruit tarts laden with fresh (now glazed) fruits and so forth....  trust me, they are good there, but there simply was not room for it!  i'll have to be careful what to order (or just not order that) because the service is great there, and the pasta portions (if you get long pasta) are decent.  the entrees are definitely pleasing.  address: 5474 spring garden rd., halifax, nova scotia  hours: mon-sat 11-11   (four point two / five)

         six-month anniversary    .... since i started jogging as an alternative / replacement for doing aerobics, that is.  i find it funny how if you asked me a year ago if i would be jogging, i would have laughed and said, "I'd never!"  because, to me, it was  boring .  aerobics had some attractive features that i thought would make me a lifer as an aerobics bunny:     choreographed and "routines"  set to an ever-changing variety of pop / dance music provided by the aerobics instructor  flexibility and cardio rolled in one  the presence of other people to give me the challenge to top them all    but then last summer the aerobics schedule didn't seem to work out with my schedule.  i find it most optimal to arrive fifteen minutes early for a one-hour session and with all the preparation before and after, i'm out of school / work for two hours for a one-hour aerobic session that has only 25 - 35 minutes of cardio.  waste of my time....  through all the pain and missteps, i've found that jogging fits with my lifestyle.  maybe i've changed (i.e., grown up!), as well, to not find it so  boring .  i've considered entering a 10K marathon someday - that would require jogging outdoors, wouldn't it?  and i think it's a testiment that things are starting to stick, don't you think, when i'm finally able to jog endless number of laps  without music .  that, in my wildest and craziest dreams, i thought i would never do!  (see part about being aerobics bunny and liking the aerobics music.)  funny: i don't think i've experienced that happy-endorphin rush that keeps people running. okay, is it because i don't actually  run ?  maybe it's not so intense that i thought it would be.  i still get an unbelievably great feeling from accomplishing what i set out to at the beginning of a session.  so, now i'm wondering: when do i stop being a newbie jogger?  .... i guess it comes when there is absolutely no way i'm going to stop doing this.  not quite yet, i guess, then.

         mitsubishi in canada    me not big on cars but it's kinda neat that mitsubishi has arrived in canada and we have another option.  better yet (for someone who doesn't care much about cars) is the commercials.  the first one i saw used music called "Start the Commotion" for the 2003 eclipse.  the most recent one, i learned from  urlLink this site  is "Breathe" by telepopmusik.  it's a useful site i hope sticks around!

         weekend    so, the whole   christmas formal   thing didn't work out.  i even went out on thursday night after submitting a project due that day to shop for (and found!) a dress for the event.  then that very night mum tells me that i had to work on friday.  two parties made reservations and from my experience when it rains, it pours in terms of the volume of customers arriving at the restaurant on a given night!  i felt this mix of regret and relief about not going.  on thursday morning, i received an email on the CS mailing list that the ticket sales for the event weren't doing so hot, it was less than half of last year's number (that was 200) so i had this uneasy feeling that feelings of the night dragging on seeing the same 60 people over and over would only get amplified.   luckily  i didn't go crazy and buy a princess-kinda prom dress but instead a black cocktail kinda dress (i.e., not long to my feel but down to my knees) which would have been entirely inappropriate for a better-planned and better-organized ball (like the Science faculty) but just fine for a more casual even like that hosted by the CS faculty.  worked like a maniac at the restaurant on both friday and saturday which was really good for accumulating some christmas $$.  :)    this might sound really shallow but if i see money when i see a customer, i'm nicer to them.    it's not like i'm fakely nice to someone who tips better, i'm just plain-out nicer to one.  because there is nothing more irritating than people who take advantage of wait-service thinking it's "free" and that they are slobby eaters to boot.  if someone's going to be nicer to me and appreciate that i'm putting effort (except i don't chat) into my job and doing it decently and  with class , i'll actually bother to remember them for the next time.  i also don't understand how people can make such a mess of everything they touch.  when i was cleaning up one of mum's tables, my hands got increasingly  sticky  collecting the glasses and silverware and so forth.  bleh!  on saturday,   i got my ears pierced  .   finally  i can do something about earrings that are given to me as presents!  i felt somewhat lame, being 24 years old and going into a girly-accessory store frequented by 8-year-olds up to 30-year-olds who won't grow up and asking the girl who might not even have been 20-something to pierce my ears for the very first time.  sis was there for moral support and i was squeezing her hand harder before the actual hole was punched.  whee!  four more weeks of this nonsense having to care about these flappy appendages i've never noticed before on my head.  i've asked mum for diamond earrings for christmas.  :p  (hey, she's been giving me diamond jewelry for the past couple of years for christmas because i'm so pleased with it!.... and if she won't get it for me... who else will??)  the original plan on saturday night was to watch   die another day   but that fell through first when i couldn't get off work early enough and second when we arrived at the movie theater and it was sold out.  go figure.  on the way to a pool hall (and i wasn't that enthusiastic about playing against a pool shark, but much more enthusiastic than the idea of glow-in-the-dark mini-golf), the idea of going   bowling   came up, in particular the ten-pin variety with the heavy balls with holes for your fingers.  it was something i had never tried and neither had S.  despite pushing for the change in plans, i was greatly afraid of humiliation and inadequacy... which played out completely with more than a few gutterballs....!  it turned out okay because i finally got the hang of it.  there is something somewhat relaxing knowing that there was no one who would know me at the bowling alley and some kind of equalizing factor stepping down from my tall boots into flat dopey shoes.  i think i was feeling some kind of   performance anxiety   partway through it when i got a strike once and followed that immediately with the next two balls being so attracted to the gutter it wasn't funny....  i beat S. in the end.  :p  dont' think he likes to remember that.  :p

         all about love     This week in Friends:  Phoebe goes to have dinner with her new boyfriend and his parents.  They are snotty-riche and she is whatever-she-is bohemian-hippie with a shady past and uncertain present.  No matter what she says doesn't seem like the right thing - it would make you feel better about  any  of your own first encounters with significant others' parents.  When she has to excuse herself to throw up because she forced herself to eat veal because they forgot she was vegetarian, his parents try to match him with another girl.  He refuses and lashes back at his parents for not accepting her and she is returning from the washroom when he declares he loves her and they jet from the joint.   This week in Will & Grace:   Grace's new boyfriend has her unwittingly brunching with his parents.  Thinking the old folks are just friends of his, she is herself and scoffs at their passions: art, theater, and literature.  When he tells her as if it was a really good joke that she has just met his parents, she bends over backwards to try to remedy the situation to just make things worse.  They have an argument and somewhere in the heat of things, he declares that he loves her and that's why he cared so much about her meeting his parents and being her normal self that he loves.   This week on Alias:  Breaking from the general theme of things, slightly, Vaughn has contracted an ebola-like virus and Sydney, of course, undertakes the mission to retrieve the antidote that requires a vial of his serum for a gene-specific antidote serum, apparently.  Sydney's captivating (and captive) mother provides valuable information and asks the obvious question of the possibly dead lover: does he love her?  Well, you wonder how much he does when when she is about to leave for the country housing the antidote-manufacturing facility and runs into his listed emergency contact, a Alice who introduces herself as his girlfriend.  When Vaughn is well again, he visits Sydney's mom to thank her even though she killed his father) and she tells him she did not do it for him.  He owes her an explanation of his conduct towards Sydney.  Apparently he's trying to lead a "normal life."  Apparently the entry of Sydney into his life has made it much better and much worse in a way.  And there exist very complicated regulations on the relationship between a handler (Vaughn) and his asset (Sydney).  He really wants to explain to Sydney his gf-situation but with a small smile, she won't hear it.  She walks off and when he chases after her in the corridor, she mysteriously disappears and there is some kind of understanding in this whole exchange....  It must be the impending Christmas season (grr) that has me warm and fuzzy in feeling inside.  It has to do with a Christmas formal around the corner (on Friday) that is so much more fun to think about going to than the reality of it isn't quite so good.  And it has to do with receiving yesterday what I consider the most romantic and mature proposition that I've received in a long time!

         change and "being yourself"    met a girl yesterday, chinese, who has naturally brown, wavy hair.  she asked me if i knew of any beauty parlours that did natural colouring, i.e., she is sensitive to chemicals.  not that i know of!  i mean, i know how to naturally lighten black hair but i don't know how to reverse it.  you see, after a lifetime of having brown hair, she wants black hair and i can understand where she is coming from even if i want,   for the change of it  , evenly brown-coloured hair that is wavy!  how could i possibly console her that she might have to just live with it and to relish being herself when i'm standing there with coloured hair and just after i told her i want to get my hair wave-permed over christmas??    "being myself [wyn, that is]," i guess, is about constantly changing, not getting stale, being different, being  ahead  of the times, and, finally, not being afraid to be whatever it is i turn out to be  .  and even if i'm not ahead, being retro or conservative is always cool as well if you play it right.  and then, finally, one day i will want to be  au naturel .  i figure i'll stop colouring my hair in five years or so....

         jogging in binary    didn't bring my discman to go jogging and discovered something fascinating, to me, at least.  that is, i learned that i jog faster (more consistency, i guess) without my music that is not mixed or anything to have a semi-constant rate between songs.  so i did 30 laps in 50 minutes which is a 10-minute mile.  :)  my usual habit is to change the hand that is holding my discman every three laps and that is the only thing that kept me from skipping laps (which i did inadvertantly anyways).  without a discman i was at peril of seriously losing track of my laps (especially when i had to do nine in a row in the same direction).  so i tried out something really nerdy: counting in binary on my fingers.  apparently you only need four fingers and a thumb to count to 30.  it worked out really well except sometimes my pinky (used for the least significant bit) would go rogue and pop up during an even-numbered lap so that i would think that i had done one extra.  i think i caught myself everytime that happened.  because i've been sick for a week (an annoying cough that will not leave) and because monday was a holiday, until today i hadn't gone jogging in a week.  it was unaccustomatedly humid in the fieldhouse and i wanted to call it quits after 9 laps but several things kept me going:    S. said that he can't do 20 laps any longer and i had to do at least better than that!  wanted to test out my binary counting system to the end  the motivation that if i can't seem to do 100% of the usual means i'm a failure in life  knowing that i did have the energy in me to complete 30 laps  knowing that i had to go at least 12 laps (20 minutes) to get my heart going, then at least 18 laps for a half-hour workout and 24 laps to be 80% of normal.... by that point, i may as well finish!    the weird things that run through your head when there is no other distraction....

         thirsty duck    they have a nachos nite on mondays -- $5.00 for a plate (tray) of any kind of their nachos.  they have beef, chicken, veggie, or original, originally priced at $6.95.  i got beef and was amazed.  it's a good deal even at $6.95!  the nachos were mysteriously really crunchy and my suspicion is that they were fried or something, kind oily.  i kind of wanted to try out some of the other stuff on the menu but it was nachos nite and aside from that, i will probably never go there again.  it's a bit of a hole.  not really, i'm sure, but certainly scummier than the places i usually frequent.  oh well, you have to see some things for yourself, i guess.

         10 Things I learned while on the CS Pubcrawl II for 2002/2003    So, I went on my first pubcrawl ever on Friday night.  There have been numerous opportunities in my undergrad years (although I would note that these same opportunities did not present themselves so much when I was at the University of Waterloo - might be a different province/city thing.  Might be an unobservant wyn-thing.) and sometimes I have been close to considering going.  In my chemistry/biochemistry days I was reluctant to go with fellow biochems/chems because, well, they party together on a regular basis and I was out of the loop.  My only friends in chem are drinkers and I have long since stop being a drinker and I knew that I wouldn't have fun tagging along with them.   Finally , I'm at a place where, well, I don't necessarily belong but I'm  comfortable .  Further, M. is finally legal to go out on these pubcrawls and she told me she wanted to experience a pubcrawl and I was all for trying one out with her.  No pubcrawl t-shirts in the traditional sense with a bar-list on the back to remind you where you have to be when.  But if you bought a t-shirt for $10, your cover at every place was covered and so late on Friday afternoon of the pubcrawl, I caved in and bought a not-so-cool t-shirt.  Well, it could have been worse.  It could have been some crazy design and white and loose-fitting.  As it was, small size was loose-fitting, but the Superman logo (with "CS" instead of just an "S") emblazened on our chests was kind of fun and empowering in feeling.  Here is the bar list we followed: 6:00-8:00 - Zero Hour 8:00-9:00 - Planet Pool 9:00-10:00 - Pitchmans' Pub 10:00-11:00 - The Mercury 11:00-12:00 Merrill's 12:00-close: Pacifico  M. and I were reluctant to join Zero Hour (formerly known as Geek Beer, the equivalent to Chem Beer, Biochem Beer, and Aftermath) at its official beginning - I mean, what losers do that?  But it was dinner time and smell of pizza arriving meant we caved in at 6:30 and were some of the first to arrive at the festivities.  There weren't a whole lot of people downstairs but gradually they drifted in to meet up with the rest of the pubcrawling crowd and (if I drank) I would want to get some cheap drinks.  Mike's Hard drinks and apple cider were being sold for $1.  Then we headed for Planet Pool.  Didn't partake in the "herding" part that I'm told is common at pubcrawls because I wanted to drive my car downtown to pick it up there later.  Obviously, it's a pool hall.  A bit different from Dooly's that is your pool hall franchise in Hali.  Planet Pool is a bit grittier, not quite so uniform in look, a real "hall" feeling to it while being quite small.  There is a square-shaped bar in the middle of the place.  I indulged in a game with a partner.  We didn't manage to beat the reigning champions.  Oh well, it was fun nonetheless.  The hour flew by and at the end of it, I was chatting with a friend while he was sending tequila shots to three of his friends around the corner at the bar.  In return, they bought him two.  Naive me, I thought they just wanted to see him more drunk but I think one was for me!  I  was  a tequila shot virgin and as such squealed about how I've never done it before and airheadedly had to asked in what order to do things (no salt was given to us).    My fraidy-cat behaviour was such to make him share with me that he doesn't like to go out with virgins who say they don't know how to do things  .  So down it went.  Not quite so fluidly as I have seen my girlfriends do it but in continuous sips and then in went the lemon.  It wasn't so bad.  Nearly immediately I was flushed and we continued to the next place.  Pitchman's Pub is a novelty in Hali so far - it is a non-smoking pub by day.  Big place, kind of sports pub kind of place.  I had never been to the other rooms and we found one that contained a big screen television and plenty of leather sofas where we vegged for an hour.  Owners must not have appreciated those of us who saw the place as a place to lounge for an hour and not to drink.  That's okay, I was still suffering from my one shot less than an hour before.  I learned that   I'm just like my mother, making a big deal from having a smallest amount of alcohol, blowing things out of proportion - so I simply must stop being so bothersome  .  Then we walked down the hill to The Mercury, a small dance club that has an okay Friday nights with no cover and cheap drinks.  Problem is the word hasn't gotten out it is  okay  on Friday nights.  Amazingly, the place was filled with old people and when you're making your way from the entrance, you expect the same crowd consistency but there seemed to be a repulsion from the dance floor.  No one was on it.  We were some of the first one and it was awkward, I tell you.  Over an hour after the shot,   I was feeling as if the effects of alcohol were wearing off.  I felt as if it take no effort to be free when I have alcohol in me and I want to take that "easy" way to being comfortable.  My mind knows that I can be free without the drink but it is lazy to work and that is why I do not drink on a regular basis.    So I forged ahead and danced as if I was drunk.  There's a guy I was talking to in the summer that for personal reasons I blew off for the past couple of months.    Every girl knows that a guy looks more eligible if she sees eligible girls giving him a chance.    Anyways, we have started talking again and I'm sorry I ever ceased.  He's alright afterall.  The next bar was Merrill's that I had never been to.  It's known as the "sports bar" in Hali and sometimes I have heard about some hip-hop parties being held there.  I still don't know why guys don't like the place.  It is housed in a Heritage building with impressive column front and up some stairs.  Inside the ceiling is extraordinarily high and intricately carved.  I thought it was nice and such a shame there was nothing to do.  It felt a bit like a train station.  There was a live band setting up... very loud music.  And I think a neat thing was an alcove upstairs overlooking the entire bar that I found while I was exploring the place.  Finally, we went to Pacifico, you know, where I like to go best in Hali.  Unfortunately the music kind of sucked and we spent most of the time sitting down.  When we were dancing, I choose the speakers.  But it wasn't the usual case where I knew I looked hot but instead I felt kind of dumpy in my shirt and so I felt as if I didn't deserve to be amongst the girls who actually took pains to look nice.    Next time I'll just tag along with the pubcrawl if I want to, and wear whatever I want to feel comfortable in my skin.  It is my first policy when deciding what to wear to go out.    That, it seems, concludes my first pubcrawl.  That wasn't quite ten things was it?  Oh well.  Here's another one:   There is something to be said about partying with your classmates.  There is also a feeling of being restricted when your classmates (even if they aren't your friends) see you being crazy.  So, I don't.

         momoya.... ja!    Dinner last night at Momoya Sushi Bar on Barrington Street.  I specifically wanted to go there because I do not know of any other place in the city that serves sukiyaki (Japanese hot pot).  It's a quaint place in downtown Hali with big open windows for passers-by to look inside and see a full house on a Saturday night.  They have "traditional" seating at square tables with embedded leg areas.  You might even have to take off your shoes when you sit in there!  There are a few other tables with dark wooden benches - yes, sitting on benches - that is very spartan!  My poor sore throat had a penchant for something tasty but not the least bit oily or fried.  Sukiyaki it is.  We also ordered Inaru (tofu skin nigiri) (2 pcs for $4.50) that S. liked so much we ordered another dish.  And spicy sake maki (salmon sushi) (6 pcs for $5).  I think the last time I was there I also couldn't decide between the sukiyaki or the shabu shabu: by their description, they sound very similar - thinly sliced beef and vegetables, boiled in a broth.  I asked the server the difference and she said it was different sauce.  She also told me that sukiyaki had more flavour and so I went for it ($38, a dinner for two).  It took a while for the sukiyaki to arrive but we feasted on sushi in the meantime.  I forgot that "spicy" salmon just means they put a spicy dressing over the exposed salmon.  It was delicious (if unnecessarily delicate proportions) nonetheless.  The inaru was also good.  I was surprised because the menu did not way it was tofu skin and I thought it would be slabs of tofu bundled with a bed of rice with a strand of seaweed but instead it was rice and some wasabi wrapped in tofu skin.  The tofu skin (I've tried before) was really sweet and I did not particularly enjoy that as much as S. did apparently.  And after some delay the sukiyaki arrived.  The manager (I assume) was a darling to get us started by throwing our eggs into the boiling broth and making the first two slices of beef.  I forgive her for not giving us all the rice we were supposed to get!  We got between 16 and 20 slices of beef, nappa, broad noodles (not udon), carrots, green onions, and cubed tofu.  It was divinely delicious thanks to the special dipping sauce for the beef.  I learned that the noodles in sukiyaki sauce was to-die-for (since I look "soup noodles").  S. was amazed at the experience and it also pleased me to enlighten someone to the unique eating traditions we have!

         winter come early    guess what?  we had a snow day at Dalhousie today.  i was in anyways before they closed the university because my sister was supposed to have a test first thing in the morning.  that didn't happen nor did anything else at school.  can you believe getting a snow day on november 7th??  it's just insane!  it was hardly bad conditions.  it was simply surprising and the power situation to campus was a bit iffy.  sis dared me to try the milk in the fridge after we lost power overnight....  very funny.  i've been popping Halls Defense Vitamin C supplements (reached my daily maximum by 8 a.m.) and Halls cough drops and chinese herbal cough medicine.  and sleeping a lot in hopes that when i wake the sore throat and uncontrollable fits of coughing will vanish!  it hasn't.... :(  today's friday five isn't worth me answering.  it's all about elections and since it's based in the u.s., the questions are worded for americans.  sure the questions are still relevant to canadians, but i can't give sensible answers so i won't.

         f5       Were you raised in a particular religious faith?   Nope.  But I haven't been entirely shielded from it either.  While my parents are too busy with their lives to attend any kind of services or worship, my maternal grandmother is Buddhist while my paternal grandmother is Methodist.  I went to Catholic school for my first 8 years of proper education.   Do you still practice that faith? Why or why not?   For about a year, I attended a Chinese church.  My motivation to go there was not pure and I'm not ready to take the time to devote myself to the process of converting.   What do you think happens after death?   Scientifically?  :p   What is your favorite religious ritual (participating in or just observing)?   The music and solemnity of communion.   Do you believe people are basically good?   Yes.  I think people (children) become bad from what they see happening around them.

         i L O V E it    i was pulling out of my driveway with p.'s gift on my lap.  i was on my way to pick up one last thing for him and then to send the package out (finally) along with a letter.  as i was driving (dangerous, i know), i started opening the package and what i could see from opening the package from the bottom end was the coil of earphone cord and some clear plastic packaging.  i was thinking (sorry), "gee, he got  me the cd player with 45-second anti-skip at wal-mart for $60....  act happy," because p. wanted to know as soon as i received it and whether or not i liked it.  do you know what i did?  i started laughing out loud to myself, while driving alone in my van.  i  love  it p., thought i didn't know i wanted it,  urlLink it  was exactly what i wanted!    thank you....!    you see, i've been kind of sad of late.  things going through my head, weighty decisions to be made in the very near future so it was the most refreshing relief to be reminded that someone loves me and understands me.  it took p. and me more than six years and so he's not going anywhere if i'm not going anywhere and that is  really  reassuring at a point like right now in my life.    king's palace    had a hell of a time finding a chinese restaurant on quinpool road (read: eating district) for lunch today.  it's new year's eve and i wanted to visit a restaurant that suffers (and reaps a lot of profit) on a crazy day like today.  my first two choices (  china classic   and   king wah  ) were incidentally closed over the lunch hour on tuesdays and wednesdays.  i wasn't fond of the idea of eating at   dragon city   and so we settled on   king's palace    it wasn't too difficult to decide to go for a lunch special - at $4.95 - $5.65 for specials.  i like how you have a choice between three specials each day of the week.  r. and i chose one for $5.65 that offered and egg roll (default meat one, spring roll for $0.25 extra), beef fried rice, pepper chicken (hot) and sweet & sour chicken (balls) or honey garlic ribs.  i was picky and had my egg roll changed to a spring roll (cabbage, carrot, and barbequed pork), and made a substitution to have steamed rice instead of fried rice.  r.'s egg roll surprised me.  it was open-ended so the meat at the ends was scorched and crispy.  (i like how our meat egg rolls are close-ended and there isn't much ambiguity with ours that it contains ground beef with some onions for flavour!).  my spring roll was quite oily - to which k. would respond, "gee, what do you expect when it's deep-fried??"  although the cabbage / carrot / bbq pork stuffing is kind of westernized (ours have chinese mushroom, bamboo shoots, waterchestnuts, and pork.)  the pepper chicken was okay, kinda laden with onions and green peppers - i like how it was seasoned with sesame.  and the ribs were chewier than i thought they would be - i wonder if ours is as well?  i guess it was decent for undifferentiating canadian customers....  i'm not going to rate the restaurant - it was unfair since i drew so many comparisons with my own!    chicago    chicago was a great movie.  oxford is a great venue for the movie (that is not being shown anywhere else).  i also learned that the best seats in the house are second row in the balcony (first row if you're tall enough!).  i wonder how the musical would have been shown in a theater....?  makes me yearn to watch plays at neptune in the very near future.  and i'd imagine that the soundtrack (if chicago is indeed a mainstream movie) will be quite popular.  a must-see for anyone with some sense and taste.

         geeks @ the shoe shop    me, m., and a. went to the   economy shoe shop   yesterday.  imagine this: an ex-chemist/mathemetician and current medical student, an ex-biochemist and current computer scientist, and a chemist/chemical engineering student get together.  but the guys are really cool - intellectuals in a scruffy kinda way.  we must have blown away a.'s neighbour who joined us, an older man who is very well-traveled.  because m. is eager and knowledgeable after taking his first anatomy class and a. is hyped because of his research presentation in phys. chem.  .... i just tried to keep up with the guys!  :p  which was alright because i once had an interest in everything we touched on.  at first i feared that the shoe shop would be too noisy but it was a great venue.  so you couldn't speak at normal volumes but it was not like a club either (or the velvet olive).  and then it was nice to chat with m.  i admire his modesty about what success lies before him.  he doesn't have to make a point when someone asks him what he's doing like i find myself doing.  it's like   "i'm a master's student, listen to me now, because i don't know if when i graduate if i'm going to have a job."     he  knows what he'll be doing....  and he's worked hard to get where he is.  we did different things and now i'm intrigued by his mentality that got him into med school.  i'm really good about avoiding substances but i haven't been quite so good at avoiding socializing, i.e., the variety involving people of the opposite gender.  so i asked him about it - how did he refrain for five years from dating?  because it pales in importance compared to focussing on your career at present.  and he said something that is even more useful - that   dating isn't a human instinct, it comes from social pressure  .  truthfully put, so i'm kinda seriously entertaining thoughts of turning in the towel and focussing on my studies (= career).  what's worth more: career prospects or momentary fun?  hm... food for thought.

         brunch @ 44 north    another lunch with the family, sunday brunch at   44 north   in the casino nova scotia hotel (formerly the sheraton halifax) at $24.95 a person.  k.'s strategy was to not eat for over twelve hours before the meal to have a flat and empty stomach so that we may maximize our value.  it's not like we're pigs (oink) but we don't really want to turn in out dinner napkins after a plate of food.  although... after mum's first plate, maybe she had reaped the value already as it was heaped with mussels, crab, shrimp, and smoked salmon.  aside from the seafood assortment, it had everything else you could ask for: juices, lots of bread, salad and pasta salad, hot dishes (lemon pepper salmon and thai style curry chicken), hot dishes (vegetable medley, quiche, spring rolls), hot breakfast items (sausage, bacon, eggs benedict on english muffin, omlette wrap), made-before-you omlettes, made-before-you waffles (in vanilla, multigrain, or chocolate) with toppings, and an enormous assortment of desserts.  44 north (there is a restaurant in toronto by the same name and toronto  is  actually at that latitude) has huge floor to ceiling windows and it's your "fancy" restaurant in the hotel (there is also the fife & drum bar).  not much of a view though!  we were staring at the oil rigs parked at woodside.... :p  how can you rate a buffet badly?  hmm, well i don't think you can!  then it just falls to the quality of food and there's a lot of good amongst any bad (not bad for the most part, heard the roast beef was dry and mum's pork chop was hard as a rock... however), the atmostphere (very airy and bright and nice), and the service (alright, good, actually).  location: casino nova scotia hotel, 1919 upper water street, halifax  hours: (for sunday brunch) 11 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.   ( four point five / five )

         rut    boy, do i feel really predictable.  i mean, aside from working and sleeping, i don't seem to be doing too much these days of bloggable note except watching movies and the odd lunch with my family.  i have this   crisis   that is not knowing what i'm taking in the upcoming semester but i don't consider that bloggable at all!  so, for the latest movies that i've watched.....       tokyo raiders   - an hk flick starring tony leung, ekin cheung, kelly chan, and cecilia cheung for notable hk actors.  we watched the dubbed version and it was infinitely annoying to get sailor moon voices alongside a purportedly serious action flick.  the story was lame (who's imagine), there was a very unconvincing group of girl spies (think: all-asian charlie's angels) that was tony leung's posse.    top gun   - can you believe i've never watched this before??  it was fun although a lot of the jargon went way over my head.  i suspect that another viewing would set a lot of the first few minutes straight and figure that understanding an aerial sequence requires some concentration.  but, eh, who has the time to re-watch movies??  good, feel-good.  really funny (and annoying) to see the blast from the past (1986).    snatch   - didn't watch all of it but what i saw with my sister, it is a really weird movie!  too much gunplay for my liking.  a. thinks it's hilarious movie and i don't exactly understand how k. thinks it's a funny movie and i think it's a guy movie (violence) while she thinks swingers was as guy movie and i found it to be funny!    family man   - stars nicholas cage and tea leoni (she's really cute!) in a very heart-warming kinda movie.  i love those what-if adventures because i for one am particularly prone to wondering along this line....    "family man" provided some memorable lines (and after these quotes, i'll can it):    "don't screw up the best thing in your life just because you're a little unsure of who you are."  "the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor.  you make a deposit somewhere else and they closed your account forever."

         chocolate-free day    today, saturday, december 28, 2002, is my chocolate-free day.  you don't know how difficult it has been because i've been getting used to popping milk chocolate, white chocolate, and dark chocolate belgian truffles in my mouth and get through my days.  my chocolate substitute is to toast english muffins and slather it in butter and strawberry jam.  it's a bit of work so i haven't had that either.  mm, chocolate....    lunch with the family @ c.j. alexander's    who  is  c.j. alexander anyways?  would it be right to call our restaurant k.s. lock's or something?  anyways, c.j. alexander's been at west end mall for a few years now and from it's big gaudy sign, it looks like any other offer-everything okay-priced joint.  and more recently it's taken over the peddler too's spot on portland street (i.e., not a far drive for my family on a saturday 1 p.m. when we decided to head out for lunch).  i  think the idea is to make you feel like you're having a dinner out on the deck with lush greenery about you, unfinished floors, and trellises and gazebos and stuff.  unfortunately, all the plants were fake and with there being a lot of them, it had this dusty feel.  outside, there is a sign for all drivers to see that "all items on the menu are under $9."  quite true.  all their seafood dishes were $8.99 from fish / clam and chips to seafood casserole to pan-fried haddock and grilled salmon.  nearly all the pastas were $8.99 with the exception of lasagna, i think.  any "fancy" sandwiches or burgers or chicken dishes were also $8.99.  i ordered c.j's grilled salmon with orange hollandaise sauce with mashed potatoes and vegetables (8.99).  k. ordered chicken souvlaki which would also come with mashed potatoes (or rice, fries, or baked potato) and vegetables (8.99).  mum ordered a french onion soup (4.99) and daddy ordered a c.j. burger (5.99).  after a  really  long wait for our food (it wasn't busy either), well, we finally got it.  not too happily, though.  daddy's burger looked quite artificial (awfully thick and really neatly cut corners) and was reported dried by charbroiling.  his fries were fried for entirely too long.  mum's soup was apparently very salty and choking on bread - i.e., little soup, lots of bread.  k.'s souvlaki (2 skewers) was kind of funky marinated in a sour kinda curry sauce.  for me, my salmon was a bit dry and non-descript in taste from pure grilling.  it was better when touched with some hollandaise sauce that isn't the most authentic i've ever seen.  the vegetables were from frozen and had these abnormal bright colours as a result.  i don't even have the heart to continue with this review.  i mean, it would have been nice to discover a gem, a non-big name (like east side's) with decent food but it's not so that's all there is to it.  location: 650 portland street  hours: don't care   ( two point eight / five )

         the olive    last time when i went to   planet pool   i complained because i didn't like the music, i didn't like the idea of going to a place and sitting and listening to some small-time (for now) band playing covers and some original songs.  at pp, i didn't like how there were three couples dancing on a non-dance floor in front of the stage and two drunk girls in the mix.  so, good thing i didn't know it was going to be the same set up at the   velvet olive   but with a better band (actually, same singer, different back-up) solely because the venue is more  groovy  and the music also had to be as such.  i've been to the olive  once  before since my hali-reincarnation and that was for an rs smooth deal on a sunday night... i think.  didn't like it for some reason because... i don't know what!  it's a bit of a  snotty  atmosphere that particular night (like the   party house   club if it cleaned up its act some).  there's a lot of sitting as i learned tonight from velvety blue bar stools surrounding a metal table in the "back" farther from the dance floor and stage to leopard-print wrap-around seats so you can sit with twenty of your friends and drink and chat and whatnot.  before the band came on, people were milling around on the dance floor, dancing and talking, to retro straings like "buffalo stance" and "never gonna get it."  it was neat because when you have a band playing, you tend to have people dancing only because they are happy and enjoying themselves, not because they have something to prove.  then, there is also a lot more talking, more facing the artists at work on the stage.  and in this case, it is okay to dance a little hokey when they are doing an emotional rendition of some really classic rolling stones song.  it was good, actually!

         christmas dinners at the loks'    after an especially hectic evening of work at the restaurant, k. and i amused ourselves for a couple of hours while mum and dad prepared dinner.  waiting for it was an event in itself as k. would run out of the kitchen after mum dropped the still-live massive crabs with foot-long legs on the ground and they skittered!  and i walked in once when dad was beheaded a lobster and tossed it back into the bin of lobsters.  it was kind of eerie to see it extending a leg up as if searching for it's lost head *shivers.*  mum kept saying that mussels were super-fast to steam: "two minutes and they'll be done!" and she tended to that as k. and i attacked the lobsters.  she has a super-sized 2-lb one and i found that after some effort (i eat from the head down), i wasn't so hungry enough to finish the tail.  before last night, i thought the indication of undercooked mussels was a closed shell but apparently there are other clues and we learned that "two minutes" is not quite enough!.... like with the case of "dragon eye" fruit (loong-gnan), all i have to do is eat one bad one to be quite scarred from the incident.  dad also stir-fried lobsters in ginger and green onions so it was refreshing to eat something "not raw" for a change in the dinner.  to get more in the christmas spirit, i mixed up some cocktails for me, k., and mum.  mum already had a glass and a half of red wine (wrong colour i gather) during the meal.  after a glass, she was stumbling but her face was still pale.  apparently there's a chinese saying that if your face reddens, it's a good thing, the alcohol is going up.  if you just get paler, it's bad, because it's gone to your liver instead....  anyways, cocktails were yummy (milk and a total of one ounce of bailey's and tia maria).  after half a glass i was flushed and burning and dad told us of drinking stories in bermuda from decades ago.  mum was a giggly mess after her milk cocktail!  now you'd think that was odd after my spiel about temperance only a couple of days ago.  when you do it at home with your family and i certainly couldn't have poured myself a second drink without mum thinking i'm an alcohlic, it hardly feels anymore as if you're drinking.  so i don't think it applies except that i know i'm not really vulnerable after one drink but i still would decline just one drink when in public, when there are uncontrollable factors.  and if my family was not around to watch my intake, i'd have to practice the control myself and limit myself.  the next day we have our turkey dinner.  i'm not too sure the lok family has always had turkey dinner on christmas (or thanksgiving) but we do like any other family these days.  not too much too report - the gravy was too salty and i was all too glad to have only roasted potatoes, baked sweet potatoes, carrots, and chinese broccoli like the time k. and i went to the   galley buffet   and i passed over on the roast for just vegetable medley and mashed potatoes.  that is the way i would prefer  all  my meals - vegetarian, with the presence of meat for flavour but not actually eating meat.  they made me eat lots and lots of turkey.  :(   too much chocolate and too much food  this holiday season.  i haven't jogged a bit and that fanciful weight-training replacement for jogging for three weeks was suspended after a day (it is always most horrible, even on my trusty weight-training routine, on the first day).  i have this sad feeling that while i don't yo-yo diet, i yo-yo exercise (three months on, one month off) and that is the reason why i don't see those amazing results that only appear after half a year of diligence! :(  our christmas movie was   catch me if you can  .  it was a actually a toss-up between it and   two weeks notice   (sandra bullock in a romantic comedy equals the most wholesome comedies these days).  the reviews just keep rolling in for "catch" in the newspaper here and on  urlLink msnbc  so we went for it.  afterall, you never know if leonardo dicaprio will have a good movie but tom hanks is a great actor.  and it was a great movie!    "people think what you put out for them"   (paraphrasing).  i thought that the character played by leo would be smoother but he played the all-too-human con artist greatly anyhow.  i was a bit scared that it was an action (bloody) kind of outlaw flick but it was just plainly funny and heart-warming.  i was hugging my father when we left and anyone who knows me knows that that's me being affected.  recently i have also seen the movie   swingers   which was highly recommended by a. as being really hilarious.  k. didn't like it.  she didn't understand how it was funny.  i found it funny in some parts.  it is  almost  a male response to   sex and the city   but with far less sex!  not knowing what it is like to be eligible male in the dating world, i don't know how true-to-life the movie was - think that a. likes it  because  it is true-to-life.  i can sympathize with the guys - it's a bit of a shark pool in the dating world and i find myself wanting to act at times like the player guy who is the loser in the end and at other times i want to put up the honest front and that the guy who gets the awesome girl (played by heather graham) in the end (oh, and has his exgirlfriend call him after a 6-month hiatus for a good plot twist).

         "in the mood for love"    i remember reading about this movie in  urlLink macleans  magazine (in february 26, 2001: "in the mood for asia" by brian d. johnson)and i remember seeing it on the billboard for the   oxford   - the only theater in hali that shows this kind of stuff.  whether or not the article raved about the movie (i think it did), i do not remember, but i left a mark and a curiosity in me to see for myself if i'd like it.  a 2001 movie starring biggie hk actors maggie leung and tony leung, its a movie about the love affair between neighbours when / upon discovering that their spouses are involved in a love affair.  i do remember the writer remarking on the richness and artistry of the movie, on being eager to see the next tapestry outfit she would be wearing (i.e., she wore about 25 different cheungsam in the movie).  it was highly artistic (  scent of the green papaya  , anyone?) and as such i didn't understand all of it.  especially not with my mother's constant questions, not appreciating the subtleties at all!     "why do we never see mr. chan or mrs. chow?" - these are the culprits whose illicit affair brought about the deepening of that between mrs. chan and mr. chow.  throughout the movie, only their backs are shown and their voices heard.  "why do they keep on showing the slippers?" - mrs. chan spent the night in mr. chow's apartment (not what you think!) and leaves her pink slippers behind in his apartment.  the darned camera kept panning on it.  i don't know why.  "how can tony leung be so short be paired with maggie cheung taller than him??  that's not done in the 1960s!" - well, you see, the movie is set in the 1960s but it was shot in 2001.  in 2001, it's okay for the female to be paired with a shorter male actor.    i can appreciate the variety of accents on cantonese that is my native language from various classes of hk life, people of shanghai origin, and people who originally speak mandarin.  i couldn't understand in the slightest what they were saying!  and mum was continually telling me to try to understand what they saying when the corresponding subtitles appeared first and i love to read.  finally, like a total surprise to me, the actors uttered some lines and sentiments that hit really close to home: they were curious how their spouses managed to meet and start a love affair, she didn't imagine that he would fall in love with her but he did, and he didn't think he was going to fall in love with her either but sometimes when you think you are in control, you aren't really in the matters of love, of the heart.  it strained my heart somewhat to think that as far as i know (like to think) they did not consummate their relationship but their spouses had and it's poignant and yearning in that way.

         there has to be something better to do    i know inside of me that clubbing is not end-all and be-all.  it is not the only cool thing to do.  it is not what defines a person as cool (i.e., someone who really doesn't like it isn't automatically un-cool).  i keep on saying and thinking that i can hide behind doing nothing but clubbing while here in hali because there isn't  anything  else i could be doing.  that isn't entirely accurate.  in hali, you can go to clubs or watering holes for older people or the casino.  there are a handful of cafes and "drinks" places you can go to that are cool, non-drunkard venues but they close at one or 2 in the morning, certainly not the kind of places to handle post-clubbing business, even if you call it quits at the early hour of 2 a.m.!  i'm starting to feel it that i don't like clubbing so much any longer.  certainly after my experience staying up until 5 a.m. for post-clubbing, i didn't want to do that ever again (especially when i was the one driving myself home).  and while i still like the chance to basically just listen to music for a few hours in the week and learn what is popular these days, i'm starting to mind ever so much more the crowds and the craziness.  sometimes, especially when i am at some place i really disdain, i can't stand even the certainly decent people around me.  i don't believe in artificial congestion caused by everyone knowing that saturday night is the night to go to such-and-such a club.  having a dance floor more packed than a can of sardines diminishes a club in my eyes.  i want to come to this conclusion, this maturity of my own.  not because some people i'm currently spending time with tells me that they are also not so inclined to go out any longer.  that being said, last night i went to   merill's   that - remember? - i didn't like when i went there for the first time on the pub crawl.  apparently we went just on the night they had a christmas party and so it was quite packed and i took refuge for a good part of the non-dancing evening upstairs in the "balcony billiards room."  not quite a balcony like a deck as much as a room with a view of the main dance hall.  it's like a dance hall, like a train station.  not so bad except it was also noisier than the music, which i thought was weird.  there are sofas upstairs and pool table.  i could have played pool all night (because i desperately need to improve).  we were supposed to go to   the dome   afterwards.  well, that was what i originally agreed to but after some squishing at merrill's and chilling out at one place, the last thing i wanted to do was to walk to another club just because you can extend your partying (even if merrill's is the closest club to the dome) and have to bear with line-ups and having big bouncers check my id when i am  so  of the age of majority.  i was only really satisfied at merrill's at the end of the evening when i could get even with everyone that had pushed me when trying to fight my way up a set of narrow stairs and some selfish people were trying to create a second faster-flowing line going in the opposite direction - that is not  right  when that obstructed people going in the other direction so i squished people trying to go in the opposit direction as hard as i could into the bannister... whatever damage lil' me can do.  i think a girl far bigger than me squealed and whined but i really didn't care  :p    why do we still do this whole rigmarole??    the next day, when i haven't completely scrubbed off the stamp from the night before, and i'm working, all of a sudden i don't feel so cool having gone to some smoky, lewd, loud, bawdy club the night before and being a night owl.  i feel somewhat lame, actually, because in all likelihood i've missed the greater part of the next morning or i didn't miss it but was quite a useless zombie throughout it!  i'd rather do so many things... hang out at a cafe / restaurant, have a  variety  of activities to choose from (because i don't have to be your typical sedentary chinese doll girl), really neat clubs to go to, a place of my own to hold things because if i did, i might not leave my house....!  what with, oh, i want to have movie-watching parties and cooking parties and whatever other normal grown-uppy things to do that i can't do!  i had a lot of fun last year when for a short time, i had this wednesday night   "felicity" & dinner   ritual where i would try out new recipes and eat the results while oohing and aahing over the exploits of felicity and her friends.  i'd like to do that again!    temperance    a funny thing happened last week.  when i went out with m.  we were at planet pool and she was going to order herself some shots.  i was in a somewhat celebratory mood what with having certainly finished off algorithms (the bane of an undergraduate computer scientist's existence) on a good note and i knew it was a long enough night that one serving of alcohol would be gone from my system by the time i had to drive home (we're talking about hours transpiring).  i even told m. i was going to get a drink with her.  as we lined up at the bar and it was time for me to order, i shied away from ordering something alcoholic to drink.  i would appear to be such a hypocrite and i hate how i appear as such if i have a tequila shot bought for me over a month ago or i want a glass of wine not for the  effect  but once in a blue moon for the taste.  i didn't want to have alcohol as a factor for so-called improved mood or loosening of inhibitions.  i wanted however i was going to be / act to come purely from me.  further, i can hardly justify to myself the cost of alcoholic drinks and those are, sadly, the idealistic and non-idealistic factors motivating me to remain sober

         still l a z y    & watching a lot of movies, for my standards, that is.  the latest are:       ideal husband   - i rented this movie a long time ago with my sister and - typical me - i didn't watch it because i was on the phone or something.  ( so i rented it again in a 7-movies-for-$12 kind of deal and we have seven days to watch them.  what else is there to do over the week before christmas... wrestle with people at the shopping malls?? )  it stars a stellar cast consisting of jeremy northam (so great as mr. knightley in "emma"), rupert everett (that i've only seen in "next best thing" that sucked), cate blanchett (whom i saw recently in lotr1 and is so regal), and  julianne moore and minnie driver (both of whom i had never seen in a movie).  well, some of the humour, unfortunately was a bit lost on me because i was afraid my companion was not finding the movie action-packed and highly enjoyable.  i appreciate intricacy in the plot that was threatening to burst my head that wanted to relax and i also appreciate their salute to some classic play techniques.  julianne moore kept me on edge with her villianous ways and cate blanchett was adorable as the girl who never before sinned.  didn't care too much for jeremy northam's mustache (ew!) and rupert everett was dashing throughout.  :)    go   - i watched this movie ages ago when it was fairly new and it was simply hilarious to watch again.  it also has an all-star younger cast consisting of katie holmes who is so cute, sarah polley who is so edgy and crack-whore look-alike, scott wolf, taye diggs, jane krakowski, and a whole host of characters i don't know the names of.  the movie showed how the separate plans of a few individuals managed to intertwine when for each one nothing at all seemed to go right.  they are smart people making stupid mistakes in the heat of things so you have sympathy for them.  and it was edgy and real, coming from someone (me) who hasn't a faintest idea what edge and reality are....    meet the parents   - i never wanted to watch this movie because i don't prefer the looks of ben still - no, i never saw "there's something about mary."  but we decided to pick it up and a friend of mine told me it was hilariously funny but that he wouldn't want to watch it again because the mess ben stiller's character gets into are so painfully humiliating.  it didn't stick too well with me.  i didn't have a lot of sympathy for the guy.  although i did laugh at some of the abominable things that were happening, i couldn't just suspend disbelief that all those awful things could pile up.  it was alright though.    otherwise, i've just been vegging around the house, avoiding making plans for my future, checking futilely for marks to be posted, not getting out, not doing anything productive at home, in short - i really don't christmas vacation!  can't believe there are two more weeks left of this gig.... *shakes head*

         the cost of being beautiful    yesterday i went to   life salon & spa   to get my hair   curled   in a permanent way.  boy, do i remember at the beginning of last summer when i spent three hours in the same salon getting my first (and only) professional hair colouring done.  three bloody hours just to get the outer layer of my hair (and i think he got lazy around the back that i would never see) coloured.  and of the three hours yesterday, i swear to you move than half the time was spent putting all of my hair in rollers.  i have a dysfunction: i'm paranoid about the state of my hair, if it's shifted from the last time i looked in a mirror.  if it was not terribly unfashionable, i would likely prefer a helmut-style and favour using a ton of hairspray!  and then they say i can't wash my hair for 48 hours.  when you look at it, that is the usual elapsed time between shampooings for me, but when that 48-hr restriction starts immediately after dumping a lot of curling and whatever product, this is a  highly  uncomfortable position to put me in.  and  peeuu! .  three weeks and four days ago, i got my ears pierced.  part of the aftercare for pierced ears involves daily cleansing with anti-septic.  yeah, right.  i was pretty good in the beginning about cleaning my piercing but after a couple of weeks and finding that an infection had not set in, i have become remarkably lazy.  but i heard that if pierced ears get infected, they start to bleed.  ~shivers.  that means there remains 3 days and 1 week until i can safely remove these starter studs for new austrian crystal cube studs i just bought myself.  :) :) :)    laziness    been out of school for five days and i'm so disappointed in myself....!  haven't programmed a whole lot and haven't made an appointment to set my future rolling... nope.  just been christmas shopping, and watching movies, and shopping some more for myself, and working....  the night before last (tuesday), i went to see   maid in manhattan   with s.  hmm, before going in, i was quite conscious of how sappy parts of romantic comedies can be.  i can't remember just yet what sappy scene made me remember this, but i was more braced for sap.  what i wasn't prepared for was to be really bored.  jennifer lopez is beautiful, blah, blah, blah.  i just couldn't entirely suspend my belief, be willing carried off to new york that is the stuff of dreams and opportunity, nope.    restaurant reviews   urlLink     on that note, i just hand-compiled a list of the  urlLink restaurants  i have visited since may this year.  it's a a long list for someone who doesn't go out to eat but i certainly do... a lot!  thanks to s. ;) who has accompanied me on many of those excursions because i know he's not afraid to try something new and because i have this frightful tendency to order something really atrocious with the expectation that it will be really good, his selections usually give me something to go by when rating a restaurant.  i  might  be taking an advanced web programming course in which case my project is to make the who process more... uhm, scalable.  and if i don't take that web programming course, i guess it continues to get manually scaled....    on that note, i just realized that i have not properly given nods to   hamachi house  .  i may have mentioned it, the proper review of it seems to have slipped through the cracks and i consistently rave about it anyhow!  so, i went to hamachi with sis and s. yesterday.  it's the coolest japanese restaurant in the city in that the decor is ultra-hip - none of that traditional rice-paper dividers and stuff for you.  not that that's not cool either.  there is a sushi bar in the center of a small space where you can watch the chefs prepare your (and everyone else's) sushi dinner.  the sushi bar is surrounded by a moat wherein sushi boats follow in an endless circle.  i haven't really seen a use for it yet....  (not to jump immediately into things) but sushi there is divine.  i order sashimi so i can taste the fish without rice intruding in the flavour.  mm - raw slabs of fish (salmon especially) send me into throes of momentary ecstasy.  i'm a fan of their tempura soba - $4.95 and you get a heartwarming bowl of soba (or udon) noodles garnished with boiled egg slices, preserved tofu, spinach, and served in your traditional non-descript miso broth.  on a side plate, you get a serving of tempura (minus the sauce) of shrimp, sweet potato, zucchini, and carrot.  sis ordered a bento box (from $7.95-$12.95) lunch special that served up a small portion of chicken teriyaki, the same serving of tempura (with dipping sauce), 3 pcs tuna maki, 3 pcs cucumber roll, and salad for her bento box I.  we also ordered a sashimi lunch special ($9.95) consisting of three pieces of salmon sashimi ($6.00 on its own), 2 pieces tuna ($6.50 for 3 pieces), and 2 pieces red snapper.  although the cut of the red snapper (long slab) was somewhat frightful, it was delightful to eat.  the tuna was not so good a few moments after the first flavour, but the salmon was divine.  simply so divine.  though i did not order it this time, i know they have banana tempura amongst their line of desserts.  at $4.50, it's a bit pricey for a small amount of dessert but it's really yummy!  the servers at hamachi are exceptionally polite and hip and polished.  i think it's a gorgeous touch that we get ovation sticks with our cheques.  hamachi house: hours of operation: mon.-fri. 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; sat., sun dinner only, I think address: 5190 morris street   (four point six / five)   *** after the fact *** click  urlLink here  for a recent review of the food (december 8, 2003). click  urlLink here  for a recent review of the food (january 19, 2004). *********************

         lotsa movies    i mean, what else is there to do over christmas break in this blessed city??  here are the movies i have really recently watched:      austin powers: goldmember   - what's with the musical and dance sequences?  what's with the part of the movie-in-a-movie?  i don't have much recollection of the first two movies but i had to laugh in spite of myself in those because of the jokes being quite original.  in this re-iteration, i couldn't stand the gross-out humour (goldmember's flaking skin, fat b.'s bathroom habits)    polish wedding   - i rented this movie because it stars lena olin (super spy mommy from "alias"), didn't care so much for gabriel byrne or claire danes.  it was weird watching it... i didn't know what i was really expecting - okay, i was really expecting the polish version of "my big fat greek wedding," which sounds like a tailspin of fun.  alas, polish was not a tailspin in any way, especially not fast-going.  there wasn't even a wedding shown.  i call it "artsy" but it's not really as artsy-fartsy as i know others that exist to be.  ("it's not like bbc-artsy-fartsy, definitely.")  it was... different.  and then my mother sat down and watched it, ugh.    "O"   - i rented this because of julia stiles (slick chick from "save the last dance") and josh hartnett (ooh baby).  and that's about the only reason why.  oh, also though that a modern twist on othello could be interesting because i've never watched any sort of rendition of the play.  say, when i took an english literature course, the professor showed a particular scene from the bbc version of "romeo and juliet," franco zeffirelli's version, "west side story," and the modern-day version with leonardo dicaprio.  it was the scene that appeared in all the versions: the one where romeo spots juliet at the masquerade party and how he falls in love in each of the versions.  i wonder which scene(s) in "o" were really central to the original play?  otherwise, it was a fun sorta movie to watch.  my delicate eyes could not handle the love scene!    ocean's eleven   - okay, this is a small cheat: i saw this movie in the theaters but i think it was really great!  it has a kick-ass cast consisting of george clooney, andy garcia, brad pitt (i think that's the only brad pitt movie i've ever seen.... "no, you saw seven, didn't you?".... oh crap), julia roberts, matt damon, bernie mac (whoever he is), etc.  it was really slick a movie! :)  what i didn't know is that it was directed by steven soderburgh who directed "solaris" and other good movies i can't remember.    i want to watch all sort of other "stuffy" english movies: "the ideal husband," "gosford park," "mansfield park," "far from the madding crowd," "vanity fair" (except i can't find it) and really classic sci-fi movies :) : "2001," "solaris," "zardoz," maybe even old star trek movies like "wrath of khan"

         i'm done!!!    yup, all done for the term....  :)  in light of being done, m. and i went to   planet pool   because a.'s friend's boyfriend is the lead singer for some band playing there.   fortunately  it was ladies' night.  i might not have gone otherwise because i have never gone somewhere for the sole purpose of chilling out and listening to a live band.   what's with that??   i've said before how pp is more like a pool hall in it's grunge-look and open space than that franchise that is not a pool hall (dooly's).  which is cool and i can appreciate that.  we stayed for an hour because we found a sofa to sit in and chat.  (my first iced tea was free.  i wonder if my 2nd or 3rd was going to be free as well....?)    then we went to   reflections   that i haven't been to in at least a couple of years....  and then i remembered why.  well, it wasn't so bad, just that i don't feel like i do trance-kinda music without alcohol / rev / caffeine.  it was intensely strange for me when i'm used to rNb and hip-hop clubs to go to a place where "it's all about the music."  after some time, the music at reflections can get to you - into you - but for me it's kind of transient, doesn't last for all that long, because i'm sober / not high / as sensible as can be.  okay, that was basically it.  woohoo,  i'm done!!!     reading    yay, i'm finally able to get some non-school reading done.  like i've started reading jane austen's   mansfield park   and my sister (a long time ago) gave me a book called   the power of empathy  ... is that a hint from her or something??  and then there is some requisite technical reading to be done, oh, i don't know, i'll find something to keep my mind from sliding into mush over three weeks.

         the keg    we tried to go to   montana's   last night that opened up within the last two weeks at bayers lake.  apparently s. went there and raved about the service and the great ribs he got.  and when i asked him to describe how the place was with respect to lone star (texas, montana, same difference to me) and he described montana's to be like lone star but more "club."  what he meant by club, i guess, was the wooden decor and blaring country music.  eek.  ugh.  we waited for a while for a table (new restaurant rush, i guess), and perused the menu.  s. noted that the dishes aren't exactly suitable for me (knowing my tastes) so we jet.  i suggested going to   the keg  .  i have been highly affected the by commercials where you hear sizzling in the background and they convey this image of a darkened lounge-like room where you enjoy your steak with mature company... and red wine.  i guess that is the mark of effective advertising!  got there.  i was mildly peeved because it took at least fifteen minutes on a saturday night at 8 p.m. to find a parking spot for a downtown restaurant.  so when there was a line-up for non-smoking tables, i chose to sit in the smoking lounge,  hoping  (in vain) that it wouldn't be smoky.  another reason why i picked the grown-ups only lounge came to me as we passed a man waiting for a table holding a small, squealing child slithering through his arms.  if we're going to take the effort to go somewhere "nice," then i'd like to avoid the small children....  the smoking lounge had the atmosphere i was envisioning.  rounded booths for groups of four, two-person booths where we sat, high bar tables, for quick bites, and a bar at which you can sit and drink and smoke and get quick eats.  the wait-staff were dressed neatly in all black: black shirt and black pants.  it was very smoky.  and noisy and smoky.  s. was not feeling so well with the smoke.  (  sorry.  :(    )  we ordered appetizers: shrimp cocktail (8.99) for him and crab dip (7.99) for me.  the shrimp cocktail came with about six cold, shelled shrimps hanging over a cocktail glass served with some tomato / basil dipping sauce (that was a bit sour to the taste), and a bed of lettuce propping up the dip.  the crab dip was touted to be made of crab, spinach, and aged parmesan.  it seemed to have been baked and was served warm with red and yellow tortilla chips.  crab dip is  so bad  for me, but it was nonetheless a very satisfying appetizer!  as a main course, i ordered peppercorn new york (24.99) and s. ordered the prime rib and shrimp combo (23.99).  when i was ordering, i was thinking of a black pepper steak chinese-style that is so good when you have it over steamed rice, like having pepper sauce with rice.  when s. was ordering, he was envisioning a rack of ribs and a shrimp skewer.  obviously i was wrong to expect something chinese-syle!  oh yeah, the entrees come with your choice of caesar salad or garden salad consisting of green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and cucumbers in a dijon vinaigrette.  (i chose to get a garden salad.)  the appearance of my steak did not really live up to my expectations... duh.  it was a thick slice (10 oz.) with a puddle of roasted garlic mash potatoes.  i was hoping for my own serving of made-from-powder mashed potatoes like that from il mercat but i think it was the real thing and i didn't personally find real, browned garlic mixed throughout my potatoes.  should have gone for the rice pilaf instead.  my steak was sprinkled with peppercorns and it came with a peppercorn / mushroom sauce that was too salty to try after a few dips.  the steak was good - i ordered the new york style because with 28 days of aging, it was supposed to be more tender and if i've learned something about eating steak outside, it's not at tender as whatever cut we always get at home!  a little less medium rare than i expected but, great and no complaints about the serving size.  on the other hand, s. was a bit surprised that prime rib meant a slice off a roast (hence looked like steak) and not ribs with bones interspersed.  that's what we were both thinking.  it is "marblized" meaning some fat runs through it and gives that kind of rib lots of flavour.  so we'll know for next time.  the shrimp skewer came with six yummy and crispy shrimps and three kinds of dipping sauce (au jus, creamy horseradish, and a mayonnaise of some sort).  all in all, it was a fun sorta trip to the keg.  i think i have to be very wary when eating steak out because it never really lives up to my expectations and i'm starting to realize the value of the steaks i eat at home that at their chewiest is more tender than 24.99 steak!  the ambience was cool, just as advertised, and very grown-up.  there was one group spread over three rounded booths that went all out so i worry about the dollar amount of their bill - appetizers for everyone, lobster and crab dinners (35.99, i believe), lost of drinks, and even dessert.  we didn't have room for dessert, and they were very standard anyways, nothing really exciting.  address: 1712 market street, halifax  hours of operation: i don't know!   (four point three / five)

         girls' night out    v. is done her exams and m. and i haven't even started but she's leaving to go home for a whole month so we went out yesterday for one last girls' night out for the year.  i started off the night at m.'s.  she bought that same day keyboards and i touched "piano" keys for the first time in what must be seven or eight years.  such a shame considering i had something like twelve years of instruction in piano.  after playing a few ditties with the guidance of a beginner's song booklet, i found that the only other thing i could play were scales (and they weren't too well, or beyond A major).  i found that i could still read music but what went desperately away is my "finger-ring," figuring out whether i need to twist my arm so my hand could accomodate the letters coming up.  got over the novelty of playing a piano quite quickly but if i'm ever home alone (which isn't often at all), i just might have something interesting to do....  i think it's really charming that m. wants to learn to play piano.  you see, i was forced into it for most of the twelve years because it is a snobby, privileged thing to have your child learn to do, i guess.  that m. wants to learn so much for herself at her own great age so that she picked up a keyboard when she doesn't yet know how to read music... is very endearing!  i was just about to start feeling as if we were hanging out and waiting for too long when... we headed out.  first we hit   the mercury  .  i don't know what the girls did but go there a few times, make a racket and look really cute doing it and now the bouncer knows them and consequently me and ushered us in without checking id.  we are motivated by the lack of cover and $3 shooters.  mm, i kinda wanted to try out a china white: creme de cacao, bailey's, & cinnamon and your cliche sex on the beach - creme de cacao, bailey's, & banana liqueur.  the girls tried out drinking shots from a test tube, something i've never done before.  i think they had "blowjobs" - bailey's, vodka, & whipped cream.  but    i did not need liquor to dance or let loose or whatever.     for a hip-hop spell we went onto the stage to dance over the other (surprisingly large) number of revellers.  we sat out for a "techno" spell where m. and i got caught up, and then danced again.  i was feeling on-again / off-again that i was overdressed because i wasn't wearing an arm-baring, boob-baring, or navel-baring top.  nope.  i had a furry collar and cuffs and everything was covered!  :p  it was the best, i think, dancing with the girls near closing time @ the mercury when they played nelly & kelly's "dilemma."  the girls persuaded me to go to   the dome   and i was surprised that it was alright.  not too busy, we could walk around really freely.  all due to a combination of it being a friday night and people still have finals to write!  so un-busy, in fact, that we girls could occupy a stage and never have people try to cramp our style.  afterall, it was girls' night out.  one slick guy hopped onto the stage, put his arm around my neck and asked me "who are you?"  didn't like the question and he couldn't decide to dance between me and m. nor did i want to dance  that  way.  so i didn't want to dance with him.  he hopped off and came back with another girl to dance to "billy jean" that i despise so much so i left to look over the place from above.  when we were walking to my car from the dome, i was disappointed in myself for being engrossed in the subject of conversation at hand that i didn't notice the guy who was passing us, or forcing his way between us, on foot.  when he turned to look back at us, i think i gasped the loudest of all of us and spun on my heel for his face was bloody like someone had broken a beer bottle and then poked him in the face with it.  i've never seen something like that before and i watched him as he walked alone, trying to solicit some attention i think, stumble past my car, and move further one.  craziness, i tell you.  all-in-all, a great & fun night.  gonna   miss the girls   over break but maybe we found the formula to a great girls' night out - hope so!

         b . o . r . e . d    i have my first exam in five days, and then the next one in 8 days.  don't know what to do....  friends of mine are already started, got one down already.  can't wait to go Christmas shopping!!!  and correspondingly can't wait to work a lot to make money to pay off christmas shopping....!  yippee - this town has midnight madness on saturday night - no tax at selected stores and stores open two hours later for christmas shopping....!    a few more words about jogging    and then i'll can it for a while unless something  insightful  pops up.  running without a discman or any excuse to feel lopsided makes me feel like i'm   balanced   as i run - no excuses to feel lethargic or anything.  funny: i even feel as if concentrating on holding my fingers in some binary representation of the number of laps i have completed is throwing my sense of balance off but... i think that is just psychological!  further, i feel this great sense that without the distraction of music, i am / can also concentrate more on my technique.  i'm sure it really sucks but it's improving slowly and surely.  next school semester, i want to jog three times a week.  twice seems like it's keeping me healthy and on my toes but i want some kick-ass "wow" improvement over the winter for the summer!  :p  finally, i really wasn't feeling like jogging yesterday morning.  it had only been four days since the jog before and i was feeling like i couldn't do it.  i really did and i tend to ask myself when i'm on lap number 20 - "do you have the energy somewhere to do it?  how's the body feeling?"  and if the body is feeling okay, nevermind that i'm feeling bored or something and i keep on pushing it.  and yesterday, i kind of just wanted to go and study really early in the morning, take a show at the gym and be off with the routine, because i kind of wanted to start studying and my study-buddy wasn't killing himself at the gym before studying like i was.  anyhow, i'm  really  glad to have gone jogging - and proud of my small bit of self-discipline to not give up a chance for physical benefits for some transient  fun  and comfort.

         tim's @ 2:30 a.m.    i'm on this terrible track of going to sleep at 3 a.m.  it started with saturday nite when i watched an extended version of "lord of the rings" that wrapped up on sunday morning at 2:30 a.m.  so when i was done studying at school today at midnight, surely i wasn't the least bit tired.  i  hate  the way if you spend ten minutes in tim's you start to smell like that place.  anyways, there is one open twenty-four hours that is very close to my place (wow, if school were that close to home....) and the most amazingly un-tim's thing happened.  as if we were in a bakery around 2:00 a.m. we could smell fresh croissants that were just made, so i picked up a chocolate croissant.  it still doesn't hold a candle to   croissant tree   or   the baguette   but it was fun anyways to get fresh-as-fresh can be tim's croissant!

        f5 for 31-01-03       as a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? why?   i used to watch she-ra.  she was so great - a princess and a superhero at the same time with really solid girlfriends and a hunky prince boyfriend!   what was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   barbie dolls!  mum was afraid of their likeliness to reality so we never had any, i think we re-gifted the ones that came to us as birthday gifts.  as a consequence i read a lot of books!   what's the furthest from home you've been?   hong kong.  the time difference between here and hk is 12 or thirteen hours.   what's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   i wanted to learn gymnastics like my whiz cousin and be as flexible and lithe as she was.  she was also a perfectionist which either came from the sport or helped her in the sport and i wanted that perfectionist attitude as well... and the ability to do walk-overs and back handsprings!   what are your plans for the weekend?   lots of homework!  chinese new year is this weekend so i'm taking part in a vietnamese celebration for it as a dancer.  and a paper to start and finish!

        racism   there are some things about growing up sheltered that i like.  and there are some things about growing up sheltered that i  really  liked.  examples of the first case: not having to interact on a daily and prolonged basis with people from dartmouth.  there is a go-nowhere mentality.  and they speak funny.  examples of the second case: never having to encounter blatant cases of racism.  i could count all racist slurs against me on one hand.   besides  a lifetime of people thinking i'm automatically hard-working and smart - if there is such a thing, that is  good  racism... or just an ingrained stereotype.  back in grade five, i think i got a black boy expelled from my private school.  i think i accused him of stealing my pencil case.  he was bothering me and it probably was because i was chinese and thus more vulnerable than the twenty-or-so white classmates we had.  then, in grade eight, a girl who was in my inner circle of friends, who wasn't unkind to me, was reported to me by a better friend to in fact dislike me because i'm chinese.  i remember being saddened and thought it must have come from her parents' views.  what happened tonight was like fate, sk would say.  after wings at YFM i was prepared to walk m home myself but sk joined us and because of a misunderstanding, sk and i left m's place taking different paths to the same destination.  he said it wasn't all that smart for me to walk m home myself nor was it smart for me to take a different path from what he took.  "that person" (who just walked past us) could have squashed me flat and i shrugged.  the sad truth is sometimes v and m might walk home alone and they small likes like me.  so we just have to hope that tonight isn't our unlucky night....  we were waiting on spring garden, a bright, well-lit, well-traversed street with 1 bus coming along every fifteen minutes.  i walked out of the alcove to wait a few minutes and there would be two drunk (and potentially stoned) girls, both about five-six.  i didn't really notice they were pestering a girl on the phone but it was more fun to them to pester people who looked idle.  like asking sk if he would sell them a joint.  and asking me if i would sell them a joint.  just like to a panhandler i shook my head discreetly.  but that was not satisfying and they kept pestering me when i ignored them, calling me, "chink."  that's never happened to me before and i never felt how derogatory that term is until i heard it that way.  i could feel them on my elbow, saying something i can't remember so i turned and yelled at the two girls in my face to  "get away from me!"   to which they responded, "or what are you going to do?"  good question.  i wonder right now if i wanted to punch them if i would be fast enough.  he said that if he hadn't been there, i would have been beaten up and no one would have helped me even though there were three other girls at the bus stop.  sk came out of the alcove but that was hardly deterring and they bugged him for protecting me, his "c---- girlfriend."  it amazed me how they wouldn't lay off when a six-foot-tall guy (man) would stand by me.  although sk held me, they came around and pushed me and him.  he called 911 to scare them off but ceased his call when the bus arrived.  and as i was about to climb into the bus, when all our backs were turned to them, one of the girls pushed me with her boot by my behind.  why is is illegal to hit someone for provoking you....?  to which sk responded that i just got a glimpse of what it was like for him while growing up and going to public school with narrow-minded kids....  here's an idea of how sheltered i've been: i'm too old to be seeing this stuff for the first time!

         i crave change    and change with blogger is  so  easy to accomplish! some funky details that have to be fixed like the blogdescription value, comments, etc. ... was looking for something  clean  and light to represent something... i guess.  (18:19) there, done.  :)

         toronto....    i'm going to toronto on feb. 17.  and returning on the 22nd.  i'm resigned (since two years ago) to not getting much school work done during my reading week and this year will certainly not be different!  what a short trip and i have this sinking, pathetic feeling, a passing wave that i used to feel in hong kong with some kind of incredulity of being somewhere different, somewhere foreign  but toronto is hardly foreign to me....  this time around, i have tickets to watch open mike with mike bullard on the 18th.

         pain pain go away    went jogging yesterday and it was blissfully painful.  as is usually the case my legs started out as heavy and inflexible as logs.  stumps attached to my waist that went "thunk, thunk."  that kept up and threatened to spoil the whole activity but it eventually faded away in feeling when everything else got so tired.  i thought i had cooled down properly and stretched out but - lo and behold - searing pain behind my shin. :( :(  and so i stretched some more but the pain still took me by surprise later in the evening walking in the cold.  it is very  bad  you see because besides the daily stuff (like functioning!) i have to dance this saturday and in the dance i'm supposed to be an agile,   willowy village girl   growing up the natural way but instead i'm a cranky, creaky, crippled old bag.  i have to be able to crouch down fluidly and rise like a flower  four times .  darn.

         week in recap    this week sucked.  i won't go into the reasons why.  i thought i was going to jog three times but this freaky two-day-long stomache ache had me sidelined on friday.  it's not for lack of trying - we went to the track on friday at the usual time and jogged three laps and i called it quits.  we then played badminton for half an hour.   this week  will be better!  it's not shaping up to be a grand week.  certainly not as stressful as last week and that was the epitome of emotionally traumatizing.    chinese new year   is at the end of the week.  that means that this "lucky year" i've had is coming to a close.  it worries me.  i never thought through it all that things were actually going well and to think that next year will only be worse....?    f5 for 03-01-24        what is one thing you don't like about your body?   i'm short!   what are two things you love about your body?   my hair that used to be really sleek & and my eyes (i think they are expressive!)   what are three things you want to change about your home?   the size of it, where it's located, and the interior decor!   what are four books you want to read this year?   mansfied park (already started), neuromancer (already started), the hobbit, and, uhm, three black skirts (already started)   what are five promises you have kept to yourself?  why should i tell them right now??  here are some (not five) that i don't mind sharing: to be increasingly truly me no matter what the scary consequences, to stop chewing my fingernails, even in times of trial.

         thai chilli house    i've had a craving lately for   thai  ,   indian  , and   vietnamese  .  so tonight, the thai-craving was satisfied by going to hali's (thus far) only thai restaurant, the   thai chilli house  .  it's a small restaurant on blowers street squeezed between "i love sushi" (that i've never been to) and "la cave" (that i highly recommend).  there are only about ten tables all in very close quarters and the place was bustling and nearly packed the entire two hours we were there.  however, if you came in, you could still get a seat and i was pleased that we did not have to wait to sit!  for an appetizer, i ordered lettuce wrap ($8.50).  it arrived with a mountain of lettuce in one dish and a dish of filling consisting of ground pork, thai spices, onions, green pepers, and carrots.  it was also served with a sauce that i can only describe as sweet and strong and much like that used for roasted beijing duck.  the meat was okay on it's own with a peculiar (but good) spicy taste that was easily masked with the duck sauce.  for entree, i ordered green curry chicken ($9.99) and chicken menuang (boneless chicken with cashews, onions, and chilli peppers) ($9.99).  nothing came with rice and i squawked to myself when i saw the price of "jasmine" rice - $3.00 for a scoop and $5.00 for two!  when the curry arrived, i realized that i ordered the red curry last time (and was very satisfied).  as before, curry is mainly soupy, arriving in an porcelain bowl on a stand.  there were strands of chicken, green and red pepper, eggplant cubes, and wood ear (i think).  r. tasted the curry and said there were about four different flavours in succession coming from spices used like lime leaves, saffir spice (or something), green curry paste, and whatever else.  to me, it was fragrant and i can sum it up with the description it tastes a bit like a bar of soap.  (should have taken the red one!!)  the menuang (sp?) was onion-laden and r. and i don't actually like that much, but it was softened and soaked with sauce and good.  kinda reminded me of my own food (cantonese, while green curry definitely does not!) and the cashews were very comforting.  last time, i was at thai chilli with sm over a year ago.  we ordered the papaya salad (which i want again!!), red curry, and a chicken (maybe it was beef) and mushroom dish, and found that there wasn't enough rice for us at all.  i thought i remembered that there wasn't quite enough food (maybe there wasn't back then) but i'll retract my statement this time - especially since our appetizer was more filling this time.  i also ordered for less fortunate people who couldn't get away for dinner seafood fried rice with prawns and squid (9.50, very garlicky) and the most famous thai dish: pad thai (9.50, everything stuck together).  it was great food but i didn't order exactly what i would have liked, unfortunately, this time.  the service is great (because people associate the little eating corner with high prices with that kind of attitude).  and atmosphere is sparse (good, because it would be very cluttered!) and the waitresses match it wearing two-piece cotton, authentic (?) thai costumes.  location: 5234 blowers street  hours: lunch until 10 p.m.   (four point three / five)

         not a whole lot    has been happening.  well, nothing really important and happy and i like to note the happy and socialable stuff here.  i have a cool new  urlLink schedule  thanks to sw that shows not only what i'm doing but what i'm currently doing is highlighted.  otherwise, school kinda sucks.  i'm not too fond of this circumstance that is taking courses that i don't see the point of me taking.  one of my profs (who is going to win the faculty teaching award every year hands-down that they named the award after him in order to allow other profs to get it) makes me grudgingly excited to attend his   networking   class even though i grumble about what the use of it is to me ultimately.  it doesn't help that one of the classes is at 4:30 on fridays.  it does help that we get a really sleek and high-tech auditorium for lectures and i tend to hang out in the very back where you don't exactly avoid the lecture but you are further removed from it all.    game theory   on the other hand is threatening to kill me.  a fourth-year math course with weekly assignments thus far!  blargh.  i have not understood how you come up with games to play and after that what's the fun to analyze them cuz that's what the course is all about....    jogging   is great.  i'm on track to go three times this week :) :) :)  i think i messed up my right calf somewhat even when i take pains to stretch it before and after jogging.  sometimes randomly i get a sharp pain always from the same spot and when my leg is cold (like walking outside) it hurts as well.  i was only joking last week about how i can imagine a red LED on my calf just where the pain is and how it blinks whenever it hurts, whenever it's contracted when i'm walking.  but now it's just plain annoying....

         and the award for best actress goes to....    i  finally  figured out my schedule.  it goes something like this:   monday:  9:30 - 10:30 -- game theory (chase 319) 10:30 - 12:30 -- jogging (dalplex)  ---- four-hour break ----  4:30 - 5:30 -- networking (fass aud. 1)   tuesday:  10:00 - 11:30 -- data mining (fass 2017)   wednesday:  9:30 - 10:30 -- game theory (chase 319) 10:30 - 12:30 -- jogging (dalplex)  ---- four-hour break ----  4:30 - 5:30 -- networking (fass aud. 1)   thursday:  10:00 - 11:30 -- data mining (fass 2017) 11:30 - 12:30 -- esl session (csb second cup)   friday:  9:30 - 10:30 -- game theory (chase 319) 10:30 - 12:30 -- jogging (dalplex)  ---- three-hour break ----  3:30 - 4:30 -- esl session (csb second cup) 4:30 - 5:30 -- networking (fass aud. 1)  so i finally got into data mining and dropped genetic algorithms to make room.  i hope i made the right choice!  aside from learning (if only briefly) how the genetics concepts are incorporated into computer science (specifically in programming a program to find a solution), it's not exactly my cup of tea: ai, searching, machine learning, etc.  too bad my ta job doesn't show up at regular intervals.  i'm just a marker and it's a weekend job.  went to   fireside   with s.  it was positively delightful and the the review of tonight's meal can be found under the fireside link at "my eats" page from the navigation bar.  we were waiting for the bus when s. spotted this shiny ball in the graveyard.  so in order to determine that it was what he thought it was, he climbed over the fence and fetched it.  yup, it's a 10" christmas ornament ball.  gold and (thankfully) plastic.  someone(s) must have gotten it somehow from the tree at grand parade and left it in the graveyard so it's sitting on my desk right now.... :)  couldn't stop smiling because it's like the most spontaneous and somehow romantic thing anyone's done for me in a while.  ..... i can see my reflection in the ball and with its gold colour, i have this feeling it's like sporting a trophy or an oscar....

         f5 for 2003-01-10        where are you right now?   in a dinky computer lab in the third floor of the student union building.  only cuz i'm studying downstairs amidst the commotion because i'm sans caffeine.  after an embarassing incident earlier this week, i've swore to become a compulsive email-checker....   what time is it?   1:04 p.m. ast   what are you wearing?   hmm, gray pants, black loafers, and i learned from my sister to   layer it   so i'm wearing a midriff-bearing black fleece turtleneck with a zipper across the chest (prompting curious people to wonder if by unzipping the shirt what they will see....) layered underneath with a metallic silver tank top.   any people or animals around you?  describe them.   some other people in the lab.  not worth describing... well, it's gossipy isn't it when i don't know them??   what are your plans for the weekend?   just to hang out with m. and v. at our fave club (that is mercury these days) tonight and then stay in tomorrow night.  working in the restaurant each evening.  and dance practice for chinese new year on sunday.  that's about it....  homework, maybe!  :p

         jogging to lyra    getting back into it is so bloody painful.... :(  i think i was still suffering from tuesday's jog and i laid another one on, five minutes longer than the last.  well, i get about four days' break until the next one.  it's all good.  it was especially good with my new mp3 player :) :) :) that is an  urlLink rca lyra  (128 mb).  k. also got her own mobile audio device, a sony $199 discman and commented on how light (as in not so substantial and heavy from metal content) my lyra is like md players come.  but that was a great advantage in that when i hang it from my jogging pants, it does not cause any discomfort as it bounces against my waist.  :)  so it's absolutely perfect.  :)  time also flew by because s. was also jogging at the same time... a first in a long time!  when i did catch a glimpse of myself - whee - do i look like a jogger now with my ultra-small anti-skip device.    the package is complete and looking  good .    in all other respects, i'm  not  so together.  like this morning during dm class, i got this crazy idea that i could overload my courses with an additional 33% and sacrifice having a life.  aside from a course i  must  take right now, the other three are all too good to give up....!  i mean... it's not like my social life is anything worth having....!  but half an hour later (still during the lecture), i wasn't so confident of my ability to pull it off....

         f5 for 03-01-03    it's back.....!      do you wear any jewelry?  what kind?   light-catching silver bracelet(s), white-gold necklace with a pendant framing a (small) diamond, and diamond stud earrings....  i wish!  only on special occasions.  i prefer the colour of silver (or white gold) over the colour of gold which makes me feel really conservative and traditional.   how often do you wear it?   for daily wear, i think i will settle on a really pretty bracelet watch, a decent necklace if the neckline of a shirt requires it, and permanently implanted earrings.   do you have any pierchings?  if so, where?   really recently pierced ears!  but i wouldn't get anything else pierced - not because it hurt but because it would look horrible and then i'd have to concoct ways to occupy the piercings!   do you have any tattoos?  if so, where?   nein.  i do have a blue oval birthmark over my right ankle that  might  be mistake as some ugly tattoo!   what are your plans for the weekend?  for the coming weekend - to go out with my girlfriends on friday and maybe chill out on saturday at home or doing something really quiet.

         starting from scratch    aside from starting another school term and having the headache of selecting courses (where i find it so difficult to compromise between what i want to take and what is quite "smart" to take, between what i believe in doing for my own good and what everyone else's attitude), i started   jogging   again.  went into the dalplex with the naive attitude that i was going to start right where i left off over a month ago doing 30 laps in 50 minutes....  on the bright side, i haven't lost speed (stamina) and accomplished 60% of my naive goal in 60% of the time.  (at the very least goal, i wanted to have 30 minutes of cardio.)  next time, i will go for 35 minutes, then 40, then 45, and finally back to before by next friday!  my biggest problem :( :( :( was not controlling my breathing so it was pretty brutal on my lungs just half an hour.  lesson learned: i can get back to where i left off if i only take a week off but there is this serious decrease when i take a month off!    martini mondays @ fireside    hung out with the girls (m. and v.) and guy (v.'s guy) at fireside, our favourite toasty lounge for mature folk.  i suggested we get martinis because i just ate dinner and wasn't up for dessert and little did i know that martinis are on special on monday nights down from $5.50 to $3.95.  there are a whole lot of different novel martinis to choose from from an original martini to peach lady (gin, peach schnapps, dash of cranberry & grenadine) to monk chocolate (vodka, creme de cacao, & a mint stick) to blue stride (malibu rum, blue curacao, & milk) to a cosmopolitan to a melonball (vodka, melon liqueur, & orange, lime, cranberry juices).  i think each drink has about two ounces of alcohol (deal!) and the saddest part: they no longer shake it for you at your table.  mine (peach lady) was extraordinarily bitter and i was gin-lady for an hour afterwards.  in any case, it was great fun and the first day of school is hardly anything to fret about (even if we did) so we did what we did.    dreams    been having the craziest of dreams that i can remember.  two nights ago: dreamed that my sister got married (young!) to a nice canadian (white) guy about six years her senior.  she's doing neuroscience (either still undergrad or she's a graduate student... meaning she isn't in law school).  and aside from the twisted part where i accompanied them on their honeymoon, another memorable part was that my mother was not loudly opposed to the match.  last night: i was at a lounge similar to the one i was at on monday night and i don't remember who i was with but i was approached by r. and his ex-girlfriend.  he told me, not altogether gently, that he no longer loved me.  that's it.

         mixed reactions to my new hair    m.: "i like your hair crimped that way."  (upon seeing me for the first time over break) a.: "wynne's here and she's did her hair funny." (telling a friend of his over the phone) a.: "did you put something in your hair to make it do that?" (the second time he saw me with non-straight hair)  when it comes time for (chinese) new year, apparently i have to straighten my hair because village girls (what we are disguising as) won't have curly hair!  .... fortunately i don't have really blond hair... one girl has to dye her hair black for the dance....!  to get an idea of the dance, there  might  be a copy of the video at  urlLink this ftp site  where the password is "vietns".  the file is called multi.mpg (because it was the video for the dance for the multicultural festival).    issues & dreams    i had some pretty freaked-out dreams yesterday and i think i also know why....  in brief, i dreamed that i was at the club again, in a similar situation to the one on saturday night at the dome: i told the guy from hk that i would drop by and chat with him and it is implied that i will see him at his table with lots of his friend who are also from hk.  but i didn't for similar reasons as last night.  but two of my friends (guys, neither are chinese) approached girls from that group and one of my friends actually got a ride home with one of them.  so i just know that my decision is gnawing at me.  whether i appeared as a snob or too-canadian or whatever, i don't know.  i use the fact that they were drinking and my (undoubtably) unfair impression of the group as an excuse to make myself sound more morally upright.  the thing is, i've been raised most similarily to those people because my parents were also raised in hong kong.  still not the same as them (obviously) because they were raised in hong kong and my parents try to retain the good qualities they have from their upbringing.  obviously i'm most similar to fellow canadian-born chinese people (whom i find to be short in supply around here for some reason).  and i can't possibly find myself to be culturally similar to the chinese people who abound in my program who are from mainland china.  if i find even hong kong-born people to be quite different from canadian-born people.  .... so why do i keep on trying?  or caring?

         these boots  weren't  made for walking    or dancing either....  t. called the shots and we went to the   velvet olive   ( which isn't renowned for its saturday nights ).  cover was $5.  they were playing club music and it was reassuring to see it go from a sparsely-filled club at midnight to a bit more swinging (still not too much dancing) an hour later.  then we went to   the dome   where they had the gall to charge $7 cover ( i seriously hoped it would be worth it. )  but i despised it all within a few minutes of entering.  leery people.  a lot of drunkeness and brawn.  a lot of people just moving about and guys standing on the stairs with their arms crossed or next to the dance floor or overhead watching the dance floor.  we left within an hour.  i learned that t. and i share remarkably similar taste for  urlLink aldo shoes .  we have  three  identical pairs of shoes.  you could think that it's a small city here and there is not too much selection but i think  three  pairs is getting kind of coincidental.  we share (1) chunky black slide sandals, (2) front-lace-up side-zip black boots with chunky 3"-heel, and (3) square-toed black 3" skinny-heel ankle boots.  at the dome, i ran into a classmate in a recent class and i told him i would visit him at his table at some point.  part of me wanted to   see and be seen  , to shoot the breeze with him in front of his friends.  but before i did something so rash, i considered how  coarse  his language is, how free he is to be coarse around me when he doesn't know me, and looking at the table full of  cool  girls puffing smoke.  every time i'm at the dome they are also there in a pack.  ( in fact, every time i walk  out  from the library, they are hanging out outside the library. )  part of me feels like a person who is   afraid of a challenge   but another part of me is congratulating myself from avoiding a set of people that would make my life... both acceptable ( by my parents' standards, i.e., including more chinese people ) and more complicated.

         schedule for winter 2003    i've got two extra classes in there for the time being because i don't know which one to take: either game theory or theory of computation (i  must  take a "math" course) and either networking or data mining - the latter course i still haven't managed to get registered for....   monday:  9:30-10:30 game theory (chase 319)   11:30-12:30 theory of computation (fass 2022)    ----- six hour break ----  4:30-5:30 networking (fass aud 1)   tuesday:  10:00-11:30 data mining (fass 2017)   ----- four-and-a-half hour break -----    4:00-5:30 genetic algorithms (fass 2016)    wednesday:  9:30-10:30 game theory (chase 319)   11:30-12:30 theory of computation (fass 2022)    ----- six hour break ----  4:30-5:30 networking (fass aud 1)   thursday:  10:00-11:30 data mining (fass 2017)   ----- four-and-a-half hour break -----    4:00-5:30 genetic algorithms (fass 2016)    friday:  9:30-10:30 game theory (chase 319)   11:30-12:30 theory of computation (fass 2022)    ----- six hour break ----  4:30-5:30 networking (fass aud 1)  you know what has me  really  excited?  the fact that on mondays and wednesdays, my sister gets out of her classics class from the same classroom that i have networking in immediately afterwards.  i might drag her to some of my networking classes (she'll just read throughout) because the prof is very flamboyant - it's going to be fun! :)

         the end of freedom draws near....    yup, my three days of freedom (dec. 31 - jan. 2, inclusive) were  really  nice and refreshingly welcome!  first there was new year's eve that wasn't any big deal but it was really nice to have access to a car whenever i wanted to and be able to zip around to go out and then to also have dinner with my father.  new year's day was the same way (i saw "lotr: two towers" which was  really  cool.).  and then on the 2nd, i went skiing, which would have raised more alarm if my mother had been around to worry about my safety, etc.  so, the signal of the beginning of the end of my freedom was picking up my sister and mother from the airport because they were returning from toronto yesterday.  and what i learned when i was at the airport was that it has improved impressively.  i mean, i used to laugh when they called it (as far back as i can remember) the halifax  international  airport when it was so dinky and for the past few years, i noticed that changes and extensions that were made were somewhat temporary-looking and i felt that we certainly didn't look any grander (but just larger) than dinky airports in new brunswick.  it's been about half a year or more since i've been there and it looks  much  grander now with a really airy (i.e., high, high ceiling) arrivals area, an updated eating area, and a shopping-kinda promenade.  the check-in area is still a bit dinky but at least your first impression of the place (when you come through the arrivals area) is good!  so, school starts on monday and i'm really looking forward to the rigour again!

         skiing    went skiing at  urlLink ski martock  near windsor, nova scotia....  it was  really  fun.  as is the usual case, as soon as i got there, i was wondering what on earth i was getting myself into.  and these people who have  obviously  been skiing more recently than i have.  i could tell from the athletic mother wearing the hot-pink one-piece snow-suit that said "aero freestyling" (or something) buying lift passes for her two tots.  and the guys with the reflective glasses and all the right gear.  it's a sign of aging, i guess.  the last time i went skiing was in grade twelve (or was it grade eleven?) which was seven years ago.  back then, i swear, all i did was swipe on some moisturizer at the beginning of the day and believe that it was still going strong at 5 p.m. when we went up to martock.  no spf chapstick, no nothing.  no hat because it made me look like a dork.  but this time around, it was like reapplications of lip balm during the ride up and reapplication moisturizer in the lodge.  oh, and the dorkiest looking hat that didn't go with my jacket.  if it hadn't been for the hat, i would have been begging to go inside after half and hour (or less) because the whipping wind was quite merciless.  the combination all-day lift ticket and equipment rental was $39.95 (taxes included) which is not bad at all, i think.  just equipment rental is $20 and hourly lift passes cost $11 first hour, $6 second hour, $6 third hour, etc. so that you've got your money's worth if you ski for 4 hours.  oh, that was definitely the plan!  (for future reference: size 6 boot, and 140 skis as a minimum)  we first hit the bunny hill and even that looked like a mountain to me from the bottom.  i was thinking perhaps i should get a lesson....  before i went down, i thought i would be snow-plowing it all the way down but, no, i surprised myself by making a turn properly and then another and zipping down the bunny hill with complete control.  i got my ski legs back so fast!  :)  so i was ready for the bigger slopes.  only three runs besides the bunny hill were open: buttermilk (a green level), expressway (blue level), and sundance (blue level).  expressway and sundance are both about twice as long as buttermilk and if you stop and wait for your friends, you don't end up zipping down the hill at extreme speeds.  proud to say that i wiped out only once because my skis inadvertently crossed and i really wiped out.  on the last run, i was so psyched to do it well i got a little careless and spun (literally) out of control and had to put my hand down to stop.  all in all, it was a whole lot of fun.  before going up, i was thinking that with only three runs open it would be quite a pitiful doing them all day but it was alright.  you can plot different routes because expressway and sundance have junctions to cross between them and same with buttermilk and expressway.  still, after getting my ski legs back, i was wondering what the whole goal is if you're not one of those who gets an extreme rush from skiing?  for practical old me, i guess it's the physical exertion that is the hook on me: if you barrel straight down the hill, you won't be exercising as much as if you made yourself zigzag down the hill.  if only i had slimmer fitting pants... but i still felt quite lithe and like i'm shaking my butt when i ski!  and for me, sadly, that is exciting stuff.  what i noticed (and it's been seven years) was the high number of snowboarders.  i felt like a minority to be skiing which i felt to be sad because skiing is the classic sport and i wondered how many of the snowboarders would be on the hill if it weren't for this teen-oriented (i.e., skateboarding) analogue to snowboarding....?  i think there was a possibility to trade in my skis for a snowboard but besides the fact that i would need instruction, i didn't think it really suit my style.  i'll try it someday, just to be able to say i tried it and to see how these people approach the snow but i hardly think it would take it on as my sport.

        blo5ish   this  urlLink site  rocks!  when i come upon such sites, i think the author must be wielding a digital camera wherever he goes.  he seems to really love his food.  i like to review restaurants as well, but i won't review snacks.  anyways, he's really funny!

        f5 for 2003-02-21       What is your most prized material possession?   i bought my dell inspiron notebook for myself.  it certainly cost the most.  but i also really prize jewelry that mum has given me and the mp3 player that p gave me (best gift a friend has ever given me!)   What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?   my bed, 20 years.  :p  weird question to ask.   Are you a packrat?   definitely.  i get all these neat japanese and korean stationary and paraphernalia and when i "retire" them, i can't stand to throw 'em out so i have a shoe box of "retired" (and not broken) pens and pencils.  since they are in fairly good condition (durable!) but i can't continue to use it until it breaks (need change!), i don't have many qualms about gifting "previously loved" items.  i also don't throw out my school stuff.  originally it was my mother's idea to have my old school stuff for my younger sister and then it became my own habit.  now i've got nearly 20 years of school stuff and where on earth would i start throwing things out??  so i just keep on saving it....   Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?   spic-and-span.  sparse, but with really prized things showcased.   Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?   don't have a house so i'll mention my room.  it's aclutter because it's both my "study" and my bedroom.  books and papers and cd's spilling all over the place.  i have two computers and a printer in the smallest space ever given to a person.  oh, and clothes.  neatly in my closet and not usually strewn around unless i'm really busy.  i guess the only theme that has appeared is a cute little girl's room.  there is a poster that has winnie-the-pooh and tigger with the caption "pooh corner" on my door to great people.  i have a log pillow wiht pokemon characters and two square pillows with pochacco and tabo characters.  mickey mouse comforter, sheets, and pillow case.

         fe 17'03     3 TOO MANY   (0800 ast) yay!  i did my 36 laps yesterday as promised for friday (it was too darned cold fri. to trudge back and forth to the gym) yesterday instead.  couldn't do it straight (that's a whole hour!) because of a mental block against it, and it's impractical to go so long w/o water.  further it was 60 degrees (celcius) warmer indoors than it was outdoors.  so we did 24 (40 minutes) followed by 12 laps (20 minutes) after a ten-minute water break and watching-women's-basketball break.  (hope dalhousie won against uccb!  who knew cb'd have a team??)  so that was a mistake.  my lower back hurt slightly and then everso more.  when i was packing any jarring motion was debilitating and i was sadly reminded of that period 2 years ago when i injured my coccyx bone.  :(  i could swear i could hear 3 vertebrae disks grinding against each other!  but it's better now....   SECURE   love how my father has better ability to wake up at crazy hours (6:30 a.m.) than i can!  we were not too rushed to get to the airport and then faced a massive line-up going through security.  gotta love traveling just within the country.  why arrive an hour or two early if if you're late they're just going to pluck you out of line and go through faster.  i walked through the security gate while the guard was frisking someone and perceived her to growl at me for not waiting.  when i could go through, nothing went off (phew, i thought, it's a pain when it does) but she asked me if she could do a secondary check with a wand.  my watch set it off and she asked to see it (covered by the sleeve of my cardigan).  my pant button set it off and she was, like, "you wearing a belt?"  "no, it was probably the button of my pants."  "can i see it?"  and so i pulled up my shirt a little to show her.  they asked to secondary check my purse as well.  so i feel safe.  :)  (0815) we will take off soon so i'll figure out my daily itinerary!   MOVIES to check out  (courtesy of feb. issue of  urlLink enroute  magazine)  bollywood / hollywood the lion roars (louis koo, cecilia yip) summer i love you (richie yen, candy lo)   MTRL BLURB   (1839) so it was really.... cold in montreal.  we took an aerobus downtown (19.75 return, for the 2 hours we were there) and i was overwhelmed.  couldn't remember from the last time i was there but after unabashedly asking for directions a few times we reached  chez corrrrra's  on rue stanley.  oh.... i so wanted to go to  la maison simon's  and we walked by it but there was not the time for it.  sk was afraid that an order of waffles would not be enough (hehe) but i characterized chez cora as a  smitty's  but better.  he ordered cora's special ($7.35) that comes with 2 eggs, breakfast sausage, bacon, ham, fries (roasted potatoes), toast, and a crepe.  i ordered crepe poire (10" crepe with hazelnut spread and watery pears) ($8.25).  i was torn between that (sweet) and a spinach and cheddar crepe (also 8.25).  it was too much food!  but good, and the environment is so great - so francaise.  :p  caught an airbus 320 (so nice!) to toronto and then began the horrible 3-hour trek from the airport (t3) to "home" in scarborough.  first we had to find the shuttle from t3 to t2 because go buses only run to t2.  then the go bus ($3.40) through rush-hour traffic to york mills.  that reminds me of my uneasiness whenever coming to toronto.  we took a subway to shepard and i wasn't too cool coming up to unfamiliar terrain: the new shepard line.  it's so awesome that t.'s subway lines grow to connect the whole city in an efficient manner.  and then we had to travel via city bus for three intersections in another rush.  i never want to have to make my way via public transportation from the airport!   aerobus  (in montreal), 19.75  chez cora  (crepe poire + tea + tip), 10.92 + 1.50     fe 18'03     P   (0900 est) hung out with p yesterday for only an hour and then we talked on the phone.  we're going to chat on the phone every night seeing as it's just a local call now!  :) :) :)  two things:     he noticed how i wasn't wearing make-up.  not that he see me often and i took it as implied that he noticed i had no make-up and appreciated that i'm not superficially and wastefully taking those measures.  i've grown... more cheeky in my conversation.  p and i used to be closer than we are now: we lived together and shared everything.  we've grown apart :( and so when i fell naturally into being open and flirty, it was surprising to him and hence *weird* in some parts.       fe 19'03    (2000)  hey.  i'm so tired!  my feet get tired and it all goes straight to my head and i get tired and fall asleep on the bus!  but first things first.    yesterday we got to  market village  and found that *nothing* is open at 10:00 a.m.  we ate at  sam's congee .  it kind of stunk in the place!  we placed our order and it arrived very quickly.  the bbq pork rice rolls weren't so great but sk liked them very much (wait till he gets really good stuff!).  i was neutral about my congee - i've had better preserved egg before.  they added shredded lettuce - nice touch, i guess.  the sesame ball was great - so aromatic - and the "donut" was good - not as sweet as tim's and therefore superior.   sam's congee  (preserved egg & lean pork congee 3.75, preserved egg & chicken congee 4.25, "donut" 0.90, sesame ball 0.90, bbq pork rice rolls 2.50), 13.85  when we finished, most of the stores had opened.  it wasn't a really great shopping day.   sogo  had 2-for-1 deals but i didn't jump in and buy stuff.  we walked through  one's: better living  which is in the space of the former chinese movie theater (how i miss that even though i only watched one or two movies there!).  it's so big like a supermarket serving up japanese novelties to the beat of very bubble-gum japanese tunes.  it wasn't cheap.  and there was a lot of stuff i saw in  smart maple   some more shopping at  pacific mall .   one's  (2 folders @ 2.59 each), 5.95  cd u cd me  (a-mei "fever" 3.33, ayumi "rainbow" 3.33, sandy "best of" 3.33, yan-zi "to be continued" 3.33, ayumi "best of ayu-mi-x" 3.33, kelly "baby cat" 3.33), 20.00  green bar  (honeydew juice + "pearls"), 3.20  we headed down to 888 yonge (ctv building) at 5:30.  there was a long (30 or so people) line-up outside the building.  we entered into a large waiting room for over an hour.  since it's so convenient (located downtown, right after work gets off) it seems some people are regulars to watching a  mike bullard  taping.  it was a fun taping.  however i didn't learn a whole lot more since i've been in the  cityline  audience before.  erica ehm (wow, i'm old enough to remember and appreciate her!) and american hi-fi were guests.  amer hi-fi isn't my kind of music at all but they have a nice stage in the studio and i let myself get drawn in by the live show and the glitz conferred by professional cameramen weaving around to get cool angles.    after mike bullard, we went to korea town (get off the bloor line at christie) and we searched for the restaurant k and i went to last time.  just as i was afraid i wasn't going to remember it, we found it:  sejong .  before we ordered, they brought us miso soup and japanese soup ~smacks lips~  sk loved the salad dressing.  we were given a small room (they have striking red tables) with curtained doorway and introduced to a buzzer in the wall should we require assistance.  i ordred for sk hot bulgogi dinner (soooo typical korean fare) and mul naeng myun for myself.  the wonderful staff brough in 9 kimchi dishes (sk's jaw dropped) and the food shortly after.  even though p told me not to, i felt bad for not making a significant dent into it.  any of the *red* kimchi we couldn't eat because it was so fiery spicy!!  there was a lot of bulgogi and it was good!  my noodles were served cold (a surprise to me) and chewy.  we ordered green tea ice cream that sk said tasted like mango.  we were most surprised with the tab - $29!  i think we didn't tip enough at $5.... :(   sejong  (hot bulgogi 11.95, mul naeng myun 7.95, ob beer 4.5% 3.95, green tea ice tream 1.95), ~$29   today was an english-shopping day.    but first we stopped at eglinton station (it is so aromatic subway station because the food stores are within the station) for  cinnabon  buns.  mmmm.  that is all there is to say about it!  eaton center is the same as ever before.  a lot of shopping at  old navy  (where i spreed so much) and then i went into club-clothing shopping mode.  the attitude i took was: i don't care about most other stores' casual clothing selection because those stores are in hali as well and my look can then be copied.  old navy will have some of the best prices so i concentrated my efforts there.  it was great fun to shop for clubbing clothes.  a few crashes (i.e., disappointments) putting on stuff that didn't go at all but some hits that really pleased me.  (though i later realized that  sirens  does have a store in hali - eek - that means i didn't get something unique to halifax!)  guys might grumble that girls' clothing is cheaper - $20 tops and stuff, but $20 here, $25 there because you have to get so many different ones to not repeat yourself and then you're in the hole.   cinnabon  (cinnabon classic 3.00, 250 mL milk 1.00, nestea), 6.13  orange story  (mashimaro clock 15.99, weekly agenda refills 1.99), 18.28  old navy  (khaki-coloured denim bag 14.50, bamboo khaki trench coat 54.00, khaki long skirt 36.50), 120.75  limite  (black sleeveless shirt with translucent vertical stripes 24.99), 28.74  sirens  (black v-neck halter top with frog closures 24.50), 28.18  we ate at  marche  in eaton center.  pooh, a whole day in the same building.  i didn't realize that they had a complete marche.  i was pleased that sk was overwhelmed by the selection.  :)   ristorante marchelino  (nasi goreng 4.49, potato + vienna sausage 7.49, napolean 3.39, small salad - curry rice + asian noodle 2.99), 21.12  tonight's plan - see how it goes - i'm going to go for drinks with a cousin i haven't talked to in a while!     fe 20'03    (2204)  i wanted to go to  bayview garden  at yonge & clark and it was gone!  it's got the traditional dim sum and cool stuff - new-fangled to me but perhaps they are just from another region.    it was gone :( so we went to pacific mall and got lunch at  shanghai river spring restaurant .  just before sk complained to me how i hadn't shown him really good deals on food.  (what do you consider the korean meal??)  well, he spoke too soon.  lunch was so cheap!  and good.  then shopping.  i got the most awesome glamour shots reconfirming my enthusiasm for the people who run  star shots .  i just think they should open before 2 p.m. everyday!  i also learned that it's not so much fun to pose yourself!  :(  our dinner consisted of an assortment of bakery goods.  there was another pleasant surprise in the price!  and that's about it for today.  currently watching voyager on tv.  ahhhh....   shanghai river spring restaurant  (fried rice noodle with beef + soy drink, chicken w/ cream and egg over rice + hot & sour soup, onion cake 1.50, little dragon dumplings), ~$16  green grove  (green apple yogurt + milk 3.99, strawberry chiller 3.99, tip 1.72), 11.00  sogo  (3 CD holders 2x1.50, car hangy-thing says "your hopes come true" 4.99, 3 mountain-climbers keychains 2x1.50), 16.07  smart maple  (green juicy fruit pencilcase 8.99, 4 "flavors" mechanical pencils 4x1.99), 19.50  star shots , 26.00  brother bakery  (pineapple bun 1.00, crab meat bun 1.00, mexican bun 1.00, 2 egg tarts 2x0.80, chocolate swiss cake slice 1.00, curry beef puff 0.90, chocolate truffle cake slice 1.60, chesnut cake slice 1.60), 7.60  teah house  (novelty earrings 15.00), 17.25  image & sound  (boa "valenti" 4.00, yumiko "the debut" 4.00, sally yeh "you heard" 4.00), 12.00     oh, yes.  yesterday night my cousin ac took me to  marmalade cafe  on bay.  they have 3 oz. specialty martinis for $12 and up.  ac kept drinking cary grants ($16 each).  he recommended to me the mango manguso - proseco (sparkling wine), vodka, and mango nectar served in a champagne flute (cool!).  i was anxious about hooking up with my cool older cous except i didn't have a whole lot of time to be anxious (he called me up the same evening we went out)!  what i learned is that family ties still exist amongst us cousins.  ac's brother is off in another continent and i wouldn't dream to be some sort of second-in-line sibling but i should not have stayed away from the family (cousins) circle so long!  sigh - it's just that i wasn't ready for re-integration until now....     fe 21'03    (1350)    writing anova software for his lab in r language  collaboration (aw) mapping weekly growth of mouse  writing up a paper for publication ("unigene")  working on his improvements to nucleotide blast algorithm  more... but i cannot divulge    just a short list of p's 50 projects he's got on the go.  *that* is why i want to go home and do something useful.   (1709)  from the base of the cn tower.  lunch with uncle an was silent and awkward but it counts as being there and hooking up with the fam, right?  maybe it's the solid, silent ch men!  if auntie pa had been there or when aunt gr will there tomorrow there is necessarily conversation because you know we women can't stand the silence!    went first to  city (fay cheuy)  at finch & miliken (or something) but changed our minds before entering.  cuz they think there's too much msg in the cooking there.  so we went to  grand lake (tai woo) .  note to self 1: go to grand lake before 1 p.m. when the rush begins.  note to self 2: there are some places worth considering trying at the plaza where grand lake was - a taiwanese restaurant, szechuan hot pot city, japanese food, etc., at  sun wong gock .  lunch was good.  they serve up mini egg tarts in flaky pastry.  they have "gao choy gao" which is pleasing to the eye with greenish shells.  they also have "dao mieu gao" which i may like better liking "dao mieu" more than 'gao choy."  form 9-12 they have "breakfast" combos which may be a new offering at these restaurants otherwise i would have heard of them from grandparents.  combos like congee + a dim sum + rice rolls for $5.50.  good deals, of course, in chinatown!  after lunch, we shuttled around first to a meat shop where grandma could pick out smoked duck and chinese sausage for mum.  this was the first time i fought to pay for food and i lost!  we also went to a bakery and, god, i hate it when my relatives explain the shopping spree on the fact i'm from "inside" where we don't have anything chinese.  uncle an drove me to finch & yonge (so i can korean-shop) and the ride was pleasant and conversational.  just hafta remember that my older relatives aren't interested in the same things i would chat about.  so we stuck to conversation over cell phones and airline prices.  it's safe cuz my uncle is retired cbc technician and from helping manage a travel agency.  korean shopping was fun but a bit solitary.  i love the korean women who discreetly watch the patrons but don't get patronizing and how kind they are!  and now i'm at cn tower base.  mabye i'll go up later.  it's the most touristy of all tourist places and i'm sitting in the deserted cafe.   torontario gifts  (morning glory mug w/ lid 10.79, 2 mirrors with wooden frames 2x7.99, 2 weekly agenda refills 2x1.29, monthly stickers 1.99, agenda stickers 0.79, bookmark rulers 1.29, thank u card 1.29), 39.92  cn tower concourse  (milk 1.45, chocolate mousse cake 3.95), 5.98  walking over here i got out straight in my head some of my angst about being here.  as rr noted, i was so excited to come here.  to shop and eat and see p.  not in that order!  i don't like feeling like i have to make the most of each day becausse they are numbered here.  (sure, if this was a vacation to europe or somewhere enlightening it'd be different.)  i want to live here because you have a choice that you may or may not exercise - your choice.  there's the same people you see in small-town (they certainly sound the same) but 'big-scale' runs through the air here for you to capture and live it.  it turns my stomach how people get artifically puffed up because they feel they 'own' a small city.  so these visits to t. while hurtful i'm really grateful for.  reminds me that i strive to be in a big city and making it work for me instead of exploiting a small one that holds hardly anything.  it reminds me of my urge to be here, what i'm missing for each passing year in hali (helli?) fax.  it reminds me of resolutions (too private to share - rather, they'd be misunderstood).  that besides for my own Peace and sanity and development, i have another Big reason and motivation to move back here.     fe 22'03    so we went up at cn tower.  initially i was like - yawn - "tourist trap."  but it was sk's only tourist attraction (outside of eaton center and that was shopping) so i went along.  16.99 for one ticket up to lookout (indoor observatory) and glass floor (one floor down, with outdoor observatory).  i learned that skypod is another elevator ride even higher costing $8 (taxes included).  maybe they have some really neat sights on that level but i wouldn't know.  i was talking to p before going up and grumbling about the price and p (not the cheapskate i am) said he would want to ride to the top of cn tower.  i thought he was joking but he was serious.  he wanted to see how the city had changed.  so, i learned it was neat to go up and hang out there.  there were a lot of couples there and i wondered if it wasn't a function of the time (evening).  the tourists were kind of rambunctious regarding the glass floor.  like they were trying their hardest to see if they could make the glass crack.  it is possible to examine every angle and spend a lot of time in the observatory.    you see, you can waive your elevator ticket if you purchase a main course (at least $27) from the  360 o  restaurant .  we thought we'd pay 16.99 for the lift and eat at  horizons cafe  instead that had more decent prices.  however, when we asked for menus at horizons, we were only given 360 o  menus.  following sk's lead, i ordered a cocktail - twisted madras (smirnoff orange vodka, oj & cranberry juice) - and he ordered a glow-worm (smirnoff rasberry vodka, melon liqueur, 7up).  i also ordered ricotti ravioli in bison bolognese and he ordered salmon.  we were presented with a tower of the crunchiest bread i've ever had.  sk said his meal was only alright and for once i thought mine was awesome.  in a deep white bowl there were at least six ravioli with thinly sliced parmesan over each on in a sea of bison bolognese sauce with uncooked watercress liberally sprinkled.  the bison bolognese was... meaty.  no complaints here about it!  the cocktails were great too, if a bit pricy at 7.00 each.   cn tower  (lookout + glass floor 16.99), 18.18  horizons cafe  (twisted madras 7.00, glowworm 7.00, salmon 32.00, ravioli 27.00, + tip), 44.00 (just for me)  union station  (10 tokens), 19.00     saturday morning we went to  michel's baguette  at fairview mall.  (to self: thank goodness it hadn't closed shop!)  there i picked up 6 delectible double chocolate croissants, 4 veggie-cheese (broccoli-cheddar, spinach-feta) croissants, and two apple cream cheese danishes.  singly i ordered a plain cream cheese danish which was so delightful - the pastry was so sweet, the cream cheese so aromatic (but cannot hold a candle to the crumbly interior of  silver spoon  danishes of yore).  i wish i could live in tor. to go to baguette every weekend to get my 6-pack....!    after that we went for lunch at  city restaurant (fay cheuy) .  due to my riotous aunt gr, it was much livelier than yesterday's lunch.  the radish cake was a bit bland - didn't have much of the good ingredients and not pan-fried to a crisp!  we had "seung chung nai" - egg "custard" with milk.  so smooth and eggy and creamy.  :)  we also had egg tarts for dessert and aunt gr was awesome: she's like an older sister and we split food.  i thought we were done after eating 2 desserts but when a cart of fried squid came rolling around, she brightened up and we basically devoured a plate of crunchy squid dipped in hot sauce!  after lunch, we went to  chartwell shopping center  (according to aunt gr, mum likes the smoked duck from a shop near the supermarket, sun fai, but we already got smoked duck yesterday).  after grocery shopping, aunt gr and i went around to a shop where she gets her ballroom dresses.  on the way we passed by  my heart lingerie  having a special moving sale: $5 bras.  so gr sifted tirelessly through them, not caring that grandparents were done their shopping and had nothing to do.  and when she was done buying for herself she picked up two bras for her new daughter-in-law.  what a cool mother-in-law (as long as the gifts are cool and not hideous!).  at the dress shop, so uncle hk said, she put her money down like lightening if the lady says a dress / skirt / top was "just in."  she gets 1/3 off.  and, scary, i thought some of the scary sequined 40-something attire was kinda nice....  that family is so cool.  gr and hk are nearing retirement and are one of those active and open-minded couples that busy themselves with activities - like chinese watercolour painting, ballroom dancing, and myriad of social activities.  she showed us a picture of her and hk wearing matching red-on-black traditional chinese dress for a new year celebration.  tonight they are going to a chinese pianist's concert at roy thompson hall and another present from their kids is ticktes for a may 5th home game for the raptors against houston - for yao ming.  :p    was able to meet up with p as early as planned.  :)  originally he wanted to take me to a  demettre's  in markham but it was not yet open.  (you know, i've been to one in oakville, and i agree, it's only okay desserts.)  so we went to  jd (just desserts)  on hwy 7.  a little smoky but otherwise okay.  quiet at 2:30 p.m.  (later on, it is overrun by many smokers and trendoids.)  p ordered high 5 a la mode (i.e., with ice cream) that is really a towering chocolate cake.  i ordered phantom of the opera - grand marnier mousse and chocolate mousse between layers of nut meringue and a milk.  it was good and funny that the sweetest part was the meringue!  i had completely forgotten p's love for chocolate (it may have amplified in my absence) and i was surprised that he noted my aversion from chocolate in favour of fruitier selections ran farhter back than i thought (i thought it was in recent few years but apparently it runs back to when i live in t. or earlier).  after dessert, p and i went back to his place where i could meet (hyperactive) kumi.  only the 2nd cat experience i've ever had and p showed me his tricks for entertaining her!  she's soooo cute and i'm glad i can ask p anything about anything - like questions about cats!  :)  i'm also glad that he has kumi for company right now.  otherwise, by now i'm halfway home.  it's been another fun trip and until next time....

        hakka chinese   there's a new restaurant open in hali (finally) called  thai chin  that serves thai, hakka, and manchurian cuisine.  i'm really anxious to try it even though what i saw of the menu there is only a small selection of dishes.  i've heard of the famous dish being hakka chow mein and a manchurian dish (the only one) on the menu sounds interesting.  now after talking to my esl-guy, i wonder if the hakka tofu he mentioned as the famous dish for the region is the same  hakka  that i know to be a blend of indian and chinese food.  (because he looked at me blankly when i suggested the "indian" content of his beloved hakka food.)  sm recommended the indian-chinese cuisine to me... maybe it wasn't "hakka" that he said....  anyways, i was looking for (bigger) hakka restaurants in toronto to try but some of them are out of the way (like in north toronto....) and i don't have any word-of-mouth idea of what's good and what  really  not good.   why i HATE VALENTINE'S DAY  (similarily, why i hate mother's day)  all these people strolled into our restaurant (and this  really  is great) and i was 2 hours late for the rush due to a class that ends late and ran even later.  all these people taking their loved ones out for a special treat.  bah, why not treat your lover more often for no reason at all instead??  we are short-staffed even when we are fully-staffed and as soon as i got in, it was break-neck, fast-paced, non-stop work-work-work, never managing to catch up to what i had to do.  i couldn't keep up and two tables left after they placed their orders and i had so much to do i couldn't even bring them drinks.  worst of all was a group of people who bore the long wait for their food and even gave me an ultimatum ("food in ten minutes or we walk") and i busted my bum to get it to them within ten minutes.  one conniving woman in that group after some time of eating brought all the food they ordered (they ordered too much) to me to have packed into "doggie" bags.  i gave her the check and she walked out...  without paying .  i'm betting that she told one of her friends regarding the second bill of the table, "it's okay, i've taken care of it," and she just stuffed the bills in her pocket and strolled out.  that was far worse than the people who honestly left without taking anything from us.  it was the  lowest thing a person could do , to take what is not belonging to them as if it was something they deserved, as if they could decide their own terms and prices (from over $100 to $0).  like k said afterwards, what is scariest is that that mean woman is actually a mother.  in fact, she thinks that women (and people) like that shouldn't be allowed to have children.  disgruntled and disillusioned, i'm tending to agree with her....

        f5 for 2003-02-14       explain why you started to journal/blog.   i've kept a journal since i was in grade six or so so writing is like a force of habit.  i saw posts from  urlLink kp's  site and wanted to share my thoughts as whimsically as she does.  and now it's like an addiction at some times.   do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? why or why not?   know, yes.  i don't want to hide this  creative  side of me from others.   do you have a theme for your journal/blog?   just as the name implies.  it's a place for me to air out all my quirky thoughts.  p and i called them wynisms because they are unique and so non-standard!   what direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?   i want to be as reflective (but i still have my self-restrictions) and whimsical as my "dailies" are.  i want more picture links to describe my life.  (hint hint i want a digital camera!)   pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.   those ones listed on the (right) sidebar.  well, there aren't five there.... oh well!

        jogging plan   the original plan was to work up from 30 laps on monday up to 36 on friday (doing 33 today) because i'm taking a week off to go to toronto next week.  :) :) :)  but as my rotten luck would have it, i would have this dull abdominal ache all last night and this morning.  a few weeks ago, i had the same ache and only jogged three before calling it quits.  as i learned today, the pain diminishes to nearly nothing after some jogging and i continued for 18 laps (30 minutes) and i really wanted to call it quits.  it wasn't entirely comfortable because i could feel an ache across my torso and so i walked one lap and got mad at myself for wussing out.  to complete 15 more laps was not as much as i had just completed so i pushed myself to complete 33 laps albeit with a break in the middle.  i don't usually take breaks because in it i could find so many excuses to not start up again.  but sometimes it is necessary (like you're really getting dehydrated) and you can't just quit halfway.  i was hard on myself because 18 laps was only 55% of my goal.  that's a pitiful percentage!  so i am wildly impressed that i could take a break (something i'm so scared of) and still finish in the end.  but while i was at it, i wondered why on earth i'm putting myself through this all?  why don't i walk on a treadmill more often than i jog and watch mindless television shows to pass longer sessions?  why don't i just deny myself a lot of food and get skinny that way?  surely i'm more fit than if i follow that option but for what reason?  i'll find someone who will protect me at times when i am vulnerable and otherwise stay out of situations where i'd be alone and vulnerable.  i wish i knew just how much improvement i am enjoying because somes the motivation runs a little dry (i.e., i was  so  bored part way through!).  i think it's just because somewhere amidst the cloudy uncertainty,   i'm really intense  .  i haven't decided yet if i'm a   skinny person in a fat body   or a   fat person in a skinny body  .  to support the first claim, i'm not a lazy ass who wants nothing better than to sit around and watch television.  i get restless (but not as restless as some other people get) from sitting a long time.  i enjoy physical activities and participate in the select few i condone very willingly.  on the other hand, i have the most horrible food cravings and potential eating habits and what keeps me skinny is a lack of money to indulge as much as i would want to and (perhaps) a metabolism thus far to be envious of (it's not as fast as my sister's but if it were slower, i'd be a real cow the way i eat indulgently).   now for the rest of my life   it really sucks!  i feel like such a slacker-ass because my classmate are staying here and they can and will study for a midterm right after study break and definitely will start working on projects.  it's like a freebie-week to get your work done.  it's also a week where profs for upper-level courses will assume you've matured to the point where you really will study over study break so in one of my classes i've been given an assignment due the day we come back from break!  it's halfway through the term and i feel very unmotivated.  i could grumble about two courses that i'm involuntarily taking more because of future designs than an actual interest in the courses.  it means that when i look at a list of project topics,  nothing  jumps out at me.  it really, really stinks so far this term.

        procrastinating....!   i've never fiddled with css's before and now i have so that my ordered lists and bulleted lists now turn up in the same style as the rest of my page instead of going to (yucky) times font!  :)  otherwise, i'm doing computer "research" on mpoa protocol for a networking assignment and "window-shopping" for a new cell phone....  tonight (after some more serious work has been accomplished) i want to add a section to my nav-bar that has things like what i'm reading, listen to, etc.  hopefully that will give me incentive (for the reading at least) to get some reading done!

        f5 for 03-02-07       What did you have for breakfast this morning? If you didn't have breakfast, why not?   i had cereal for breakfast.  "maple nut" flavour from god knows what cereal company.  it's yummy, a small shot of sweet with some flakes and some crunchy bits that won't get soggy.   What's your favorite cereal?   banana nut muslix or special k with red berries (strawberry) are the yummiest!  and i like count chocula (just the marshmallows, really) in small quantities but never actually buy it!  :p   How often do you eat out? Do you want that to change?   define eating out....!  i'm getting this awful tendency to pick up food at the caf about three to five days a week.  but as for going to a restaurant, once or twice a week on average, i guess.  it's alright frequency, i guess, not  never  indulging and not indulging too much either.  i don't really want to be the sort who eats out all of the time and i want to learn to cook stuff that i would really look forward to eating!   What do you plan on having for dinner tonight? Got a recipe for that?   don't know!  whatever mum has in mind....  and she doesn't have recipes for her meals!   What's your favourite restaurant? Why?   favourite?  my restaurant.  though i've never had a meal there that a customer would get!    i just know that the service is really nice without being intrusive (that would be me serving!) and the surroundings are clean, the music relaxing, and the food rocks (for the cuisine we are trying to sell: canadian-influenced chinese food) because we use high-quality and fresh ingredients  .  otherwise, i don't really have  a  favourite restaurant in town - i'm kind of scared to pick a favourite that won't last.  see  urlLink my eats  for where i've been and what i've listed as "fave" that i'll go back to.  not on a weekly basis, or anything... that would be weird at this stage in my life.

        the shige   lunch at  sushi shige  today.  there's a tongue twister, if there ever was one!  it's a small restaurant wedged between two restaurants on spring garden road that opened up maybe around november 2002.  walked by there one evening hankered for dinner but the price for my sashimi dish or a box dinner was so much!!  so i vowed to come back for lunch.  they have a lunch menu.  $7.95 for 5 pieces of tempura (2 shrimp, 3 vegetables), miso soup, and salad.  $7.95, $8.95, and $9.95 for chicken, salmon, and beef teriyaki dinners.  and then a sushi combination for $9.95.  rr ordered beef teriyaki as i recommend to any newbie to japanese food teriyaki (cooked).  i browsed through the menu and was slightly overwhelmed at the selection of dishes when i knew exactly what i wanted: tempura udon ($9.50) and salmon "sushi" (actually, it was nigiri, 2 pieces for $4.25).  i wanted salmon sashimi but it was 5 pieces and $11.50.  it's always fun for me to introduce someone to a kind of food i really love and it wasn't very different for rr.  he pronounced the soup to be salty (in a good way) and immediately picked out the fish flavour and he declared his beef teriyaki (square-shaped slices, not quite as well-done as he specified) to be tangy.  the salad had this vinegary liquidy dressing that was refereshing from the creamy dressing.  and there was a side of stir-fried bean sprouts to his combination.  unlike at hamachi house, they put the tempura (2 pieces shrimp, a sweet potato, and a mushy eggplant) directly into my udon.  there was also a pile of batter shavings.  it was pretty to look at when the batter matched in colour the noodles....  tempura was great (love how fried foods japanese style are not so sinful-feeling at sweet & sour in chinese cuisine!) and the noodles are perfect for filling your appetite but not very heavy at all.  oh, and the nigiri?  divine.  for me, it's like an elevation - if it's good enough, i'll be put over.  and it's like momentary ecstasy.  i can't really tell different levels of divine-ness... and does it matter?  with a pot of green tea costing $2.25, it was all-in-all a really good meal while not breaking the bank.  it's a small space they are in but it didn't feel cramped.  the walls were painted a cheerful yellow colour, rice-paper-covered lanterns gave ambient lighting, and the rice-paper blinds went with everything.  there were soothing paintings in green- and blue-coloured themes.  with japanese pop music playing, i felt a bit like i was in a japanese girl's room - very light-weight.  location: spring garden road, on the strip near mexicali rosa's and danube cafe  hours: closed monday (for lunch), open for lunch at 11:30, open for dinner at ??   (four point six / five)

        these are the hardest hours....   when you wake up in the middle of the night and your heart is heavy.  chinese new year means something to me; that or it's a factor in making me feel further down and alone.  k is asleep and it would be insensitive to wake her to be clingy.  i'm not slated for a talk with p until another twenty-four odd so hours so i feel like he's off-limits.  sk that i would finally open up to right now when i feel so down has not called after my message to call me back hours ago.  too bad -- he missed his chance to listen in my issues.  why when i chose to do something that makes my family pleased (to spend this occasion at home) do i feel like such a party-pooper and a loser and all alone?   sleep  is usually my answer because if it comes (it did for an hour), it may last until the morning and in the morning everything always seems more optimistic.  but all of a sudden i'm an  insomniac .  happy new year!!

        amateur  foody    that's me!! :)  so, i've revamped (again) my  urlLink restaurant review page  and categorized restaurants and alphabetized them within categories because the precious few people who do go to that page couldn't care less  when  i went somewhere when they are searching for a particular restaurant....   if only  people would go there....  i've registered it both for search engines and a site meter and it's not turning up in the most obvious searches!  yet  this blog  turns up instead... this blog has turned up in interesting searches: "caloric content mcdonald's hashbrown" and various times where people have been searching for thai and japanese food in hali.  argh....  i want to try out this place in hali called  chives canadian bistro  with a price tag of $80 for wine + appetizer + main course + dessert for two.  ouch.  (suppose it is $70 for non-alcoholics.)  this information was obtained from this  urlLink wonderful article .  we should probably think of how to incorporate this line in our next menu: "all dishes are made to order. your patience is appreciated and will be rewarded." (as seen in the menu of calgary's sugo caffè italia.)  :p  because, boy oh boy, on thursday night i had a mess of a time when working because there was just my father to make our special dishes and two tables came in that ate nothing but specially prepared dishes (like six each) so he had to concentrate on each one and the poor customers had to wait longer than usual.  with the special attention needed i'm surprised it didn't take more than half an hour!  it was a weird case where i wasn't scrambling because there was too much stuff to be done as the waitress but i was waiting as the special orders backed up all the easier orders and i was scrambling because i was afraid of the customers' impressions!

        thesis week   (part one... of many)  i call it as such because on wednesday afternoon i attended four biochem honours seminars (that was all i had time for) and then on thursday morning i attended (my first) master's thesis defense.  it was neat to attend the biochem seminars when i was wasn't a presenter.  it's amazing how just a year ago i thought that failing in the seminar meant i would have to do something drastic with my life.  even if i had failed the seminar (and not then gotten my honours degree), i'm not  really  inclined to do something so drastic!  anyhow, there is a "bumper crop" of biochem honours students and there are 25 students this year compared to nine in my year.  and i really think the co-ordinator on a given year influences the tone of the entire seminar (series).  my co-ordinator is a super-over-achiever enzymologist with both an m.d. and a ph.d.  he is feared particularly by the biochemists for his chemistry questions but he actually got me on a biochemistry question instead!  because of his influence we were all very reverent, neat, and properly attired and sat like petrified statues in the front row throughout the presentations.  this year's co-ordinator is a bit more of a gung-ho prof and since not all students went on the same day the atmosphere was much more lax.  i still can't believe it was just year ago i was struggling with that kind of stuff!  anyways, if anyone had asked me (and no one did), i would have said i was attending the seminar to be inspired.  looking for a topic.  unfortunately none of the four presentations i managed to catch were along my interests in the least bit reminding me how i'm interested in conclusions drawn from their studies but am so pleased to not be in a lab doing benchwork any longer!  so yesterdya i was all pleased and puffed with myself because i overcame the angst and attended a master's thesis defense.  all the grad students (and apparently all the undergrads as well) receive notices of upcoming thesis defenses and the title of today's presentation said:   something-something- grid-computing -something-something- application-to-dna-database-searches .    yeah, that was the sucker-title that got me to attend.  it was interesting because otherwise i wouldn't know the procedure of a defense and now was a good time to attend one because many people want to get a may convocation.  i learned at least in a small respect to what standard my presentations needs to be and which profs in my department are to be most feared for their questions!  i have to choose an area and hence a supervisor in the very near future and that very thought of the pickings has me very scared indeed.  finally, i was talking to sw this morning and he's been most encouraging that i can research what i am interested in with one of the profs in our faculty  :) :)  i really hope to see sw around the next year as a fellow graduate student (and yet another student who can't seem to pry him/herself away from the vacuum that is dalhousie's grip)!  so i can't wait until this dreadful term is over (on the 17th) and i can get on (for two weeks at least) with better things.

         les liaisons dangereuses      tonight (yesterday night) i went with k and sk to watch  les liaisons dangereuses  at  urlLink neptune theater  and it was great fun!  i was really pleased with the customer service from whom i bought tickets over the phone who accomodated our seat selection: middle of the balcony.  the tickets cost 31.50 each (student pricing).  the last time i was at neptune was for another "big-name" play / musical: cabaret.  what's really great about neptune to me is that they are true to the original story but they always add this twist of unpredictability.  i don't know if i can ever get glenn close and john malkovich out of my head but the actors who played the marquise and vicomte were interesting and spectacular in their own less-reverent way.  the radio advertisement promised nudity and we got shocking amounts of it!  i wasn't so pleased with the part when vicomte broke up with mme. torvel because the surprise was ruined in the scene before when the marquis "predicted" what the vicomte would say in the break-up scene spoiling the impact of  "it is beyond my control" .  people were snickering how he played out exactly how she said until he got violent with mme. torvel.  then everyone was stunned silent.  when the marquis revealed her own game and declared  war  it was really powerfully presented and the final image of a guillotine in the backdrop (we still don't understand it) behind the three older women was quite haunting.  isn't that how  a tale of two cities  starts off, with imagery of a guillotine?  the costumes were really great - very sumptuous for the women and fine for the men - i very nearly melted!  and the set was really beautiful as well making the stage look like several different stylized french manors and halls.  they managed to create depth really well, i thought.  finally, i just wanted to plug for neptune - it's their 39th year and they are really great at bringing the big-name shows to the little people here (i don't attend the other plays).  as a little teaser, the next show we're going to watch is in a month, a musical: "the best little whorehouse in texas."  before the play we went to  urlLink sushi shige  for dinner.  follow the link and read the comment for that blog entry for yesterday's dinner!

        100% and drug-free   .... unless you count caffeine and i certainly won't because i'll be reliant on that for a while longer....  (i finished a cup of tea an hour and a half before running, and breakfast consisted of cereal and milk.)  yup, yup, i did my "usual" 30 laps (without stopping even) just to prove to myself that i could do 100%.  maybe i was especially motivated with the  wind  on my bare shoulders because i was wearing my new (more revealing) top.  i'm  back .

          mec & catalogue shopping    ahhh..... en route to picking up tickets for "les liaisons dangereuses" at neptune for tomorrow, i went to  urlLink mec  because i recently received a catalogue of their stock.  camping gear, kayaking gear, climbing gear, schmeh.  i became an mec member when i went in and wanted to buy a 500 mL nalgene water bottle (that i carry with me everywhere if i have my mec messenger bag with me) and joined because i had to.  (it's a life-time membership for $5 - i was more shocked by the procedure than distressed.)  today, i actually bought  clothing  because, naturally, i turned to see what clothing could be bought that jives well with my - ahem - runner lifestyle.  so picked up this little number you see on the side in "blue daze" - the colour you see in the inset - for $24.  on the back there is "mec" in reflective letters.  last thing i bought for working out was a red  marika  top a while back from  urlLink sportchek  for $24.99.  i figure that this "capricorn" sports top can by its style and fabric (nylon and spandex) double as a tank top this summer.  :) :) :)  it feels really awesome to wear.... do i hear  motivation ....?  unlike my sister who has a body that doesn't present surprises, i had to go into the store and try on the top.  i fit into an small but i also wanted to have maximal support because i'll wear it most often for jogging.  my sister's wardrobe has an increasing percentage of  urlLink j.crew  content and that has a two-pronged advantage: (1) not everyone here has the means to go to the states and shop j.crew nor are haligonians imaginative enough to shop outside of the box (mall) so she can look unique without dressing freaky (on the other hand i just dress freaky to be unique) and (2) the unbeatable comfort of shopping from home with your head screwed on without harsh lights painting you inevitably better than you'll ever naturally look.  we do jcrew because not every american company ships to canada (what??) and there aren't (sorry) desirable canadian brands that fit our style.

       for the record my chest hurts today.   immensely.   that's because i did 18 push-ups (not even consecutively) yesterday.  and over a hundred sit-ups for the first time in over a year.  so my abs hurt too.  this is what they call a good hurt.  :)   going out again   on saturday i met up with tn at  pacifico .  besides the night i went to thirsty duck/pitchman's/argyle, only a few weeks ago, i haven't been  clubbing  for two months which for someone who used to claim to like to go to clubs is a  long  time.  well, the short of it is that i enjoyed it.  you could even say that i enjoyed it immensely because, really, i haven't had that kind of outlet for a while (two months!).  i was gleefully pleased that the place wasn't jammed packed like i remembered it last.  it makes me want to go again this weekend - :P - but i won't because that would spoil the niceness and it can definitely wait until after finals.  that is not really so long away from now!!  tn and her brother split from the pacifico for the dome at 1:45 and for a fleeting moment it was possible that i could hang out at a club  all alone  which is some kind of weird desire of mine (haven't done it before).  but i was asked to take tn's brother's gf home so i just took off instead and it was rewarding in it's own way because she's chinese and i learned that her parents are also restaurant folk.  (too bad i can't meet their older sisters and brothers - they have long since left hali.)  i feel like i "networked" that night because of giving her a ride home, i got myself out there with the chinese community here... whatever good that will do.  tn and i didn't have a "group" that night so when we were dancing on that really packed dance floor, we stayed with the younger girls and it's kind of freaky: the other girls were a lot younger than we were!  but it was nearly reminiscent of going clubbing in toronto with chinese girlfriends on a so-called "asian night."  ~sigh~  memories!   not ready   so i've been chatting a bit with this guy from hk (al) and it's really nice because he is the talkative sort and interesting to me (all new people are, aren't they?).  in the midst of it all there is cultural exchange as well because as much as i  say  my parents are from hk,  i'm  not and it's hard and sad to realize that such a friendship is as cross-cultural as if i had a friend, say, from egypt.  well, i interact with him only and not his friends.  it's freaky because a  urlLink while back , i saw them at the dome and shied away because, well, because compared to those girls i can't speak the language, hold a cigarette elegantly, and i'm "built" (read: chubby) by comparison to their slight figures.  mostly i don't understand the half of what is said because it's slangy and because i've come to realize that i was raised on cantonese from twenty years ago, not what the kids are speaking these days and it's  difficult .  i'm actually getting the hang of trying to guess what he is saying.  sometimes no matter how much he explains (and he's extraordinarily patient) i don't get it and sometimes he says something and i'm so pleased that something i thought was rather esoteric is actually used in their everyday-slang!  (btw if you read the linked archive, he doesn't swear as much around me as he used to.  probably because i have this perplexed look on my face because i'm trying to translate what he says in my head.  and because i think i tend to make guys tone down their language around me without me ever actually saying anything.)  that's why i want either a radio that can be tuned to a radio station in toronto that broadcasts many chinese programs  and  fairchild.  .... actually, i'm  really grateful  to my mother for taking the energy to urge me to learn my language (and through it my culture).  but at the same time i'm also angry (and who knows when i will stop) because she didn't see the advantages of introducing me (us) to the chinese community here.  or to make sure we stay current while we are here in the utmost backwater of areas, most farflung from chinese civilization.  so that is the part that i have to do for myself.

        50% and drug-free   ok, that's it.  my criteria when selecting a gym when i grow up - "constant" temperature.  at dalplex the fieldhouse that houses the track is held up by the air pressure inside.  yesterday, we would have a massive snowfall the result being it was at least 5 o c warmer in the fieldhouse than usual in order to melt the snow off the roof so it doesn't collapse under the snow's weight (that happened at least once in its history).  i nearly melted and was i on some kind of drug i might still have wanted to stop early as well because the prospect of  fifteen more laps  in the stuffy warm air - the idea of that was more than i could bear so i stopped at fifteen laps = 50%.  (oh, then i spent nearly the balance of the time doing sit-ups, push-ups, and my usual flexibility exercises.  not having done sit-ups in over a year and ditto for push-ups that was a pathetic sight.  i can't do more than 10 real push-ups any longer and after not that many sit-ups my abs wouldn't stop throbbing and crying for help!)  on wednesday it may be cooler and i'll just jump back to 30 laps because today was a "break" because yesterday i had to shovel snow for fifteen or twenty minutes and ten centimeters of fluffy stuff is very heavy for little me.  it is also possible that wednesday will be every bit as warm (it's the stuffiness that is unbearable) and i'll do 70% instead and work back up by friday.  it's more than not taking something artificial for a psychological and physiological boost: it's about how much faith i have in myself.  not a whole lot today but it's going to come back.

          miracle drug      it must have been a couple of years ago when i started taking a "workout drug" and no one knew about it except for my sister and perhaps p.  and now i have to stop because here is my "horror story": every once in a while i experience what i can only describe as a chest pain.  i'm so young that this is not funny.  so although there aren't too many pills left in the bottle, i'm going to dispose of them instead of finishing off the bottle because the first time (a few weeks ago), i only felt a squeezing pain in the middle of my chest that momentarily scared me and today it was a day-long dull ache.   urlLink proenzi 99 (i think that is a dead link)  is what i've been taking most recently but i tried other  urlLink ephedra  stacks (ECA = ephedra + caffeine + aspirin).  i took it because it is a weight-loss drug, a workout drug, an energy pill, "herbal ecstacy."  i knew that part of what it does is elevate your blood pressure and it stimulate your heart but i figured i'm too young and fit to suffer from real problems.  who knows if my taking it was actually doing anything at all (i wouldn't believe it does absolutely nothing) except psychologically.  to be honest there were many days where i felt sluggish and drowsy and under the weather and icky until i took one and then i'd feel worlds  cleaner .  i *always* took one before a jog and mentally told myself that i must then have the energy to complete my goal.  i'm still the kind of person who wants a pill-solution to things: taking the time to eat, slowing metabolism, substitute for coffee / tea.  so i guess on monday the new challenge in the jog is the natural route.  i often wondered if i didn't get an endorphin rush because of the ephedra....  and i'm sure i'm going to be ok.  :)  because... have you heard of ill effects of garcinia cambogia....?

        i spy... on myself   signed both this blog and my other webspace up with  urlLink site meter  this week and it's  so much fun !  i could get addicted to checking my stats.  (yesterday for some time  you  could see all of my stats as well!)  of course the most, most frequent visitor by far is myself.  and it also makes me wary of other people who also know that i might check on 'em on a daily (or twice or thrice daily) basis (~achoo~ urlLink sw ~achoo~).   oh well.   i'm an  unabashed blogger .  so there!  :p  oh, it's not like site meter is the best or anything.  nope, i didn't do overwhelming amounts of comparison or anything.   urlLink blog patrol  looks about twice as slick and i heard of it from  urlLink karen .   ai   watched the worst show last night:  american idol .  it wasn't the first time i had ever seen it (i saw the reunion special for the first one) but it was the first time i ever got to see one with "judging" and unfortunately learned the ins and outs of the selection process and saw some competition compared to the last time.  oh well, i don't think i need to indicate  why  it was inane but it was somewhat entertaining to play an armchair critic and see if my opinions matched up with those of my more musical sister.  i'm definitely a  nicer judge .  teehee.  and i won't ever watch it again.

        dollars & sense   when i was younger, i actually wanted to be a doctor.  medical science interested me but i didn't really know what was entailed in being a doctor.  the soaps and dramas made it seem pretty nifty.  needless to say mum was pleased.  need i enumerate why i think she was pleased?!?  respect for her for having a doctor daughter ( especially  since she had nothing but daughters), respect for me being a doctor, earning more money than some other profession per hour's work, and giving free medical advice to friends and particularly family.  mum wasn't so thrilled about either of her kids being lawyers because of some perceived gouging we have received by our lawyer but since k is so inclined to be one, mum has relented and tends to try to promote skills in her that mum things would make for a good lawyer (like debating and arguing!).  i went from wanting to be a   doctor   when i was younger (it was cool) to wanting to be an   computer engineer   (the most ill-conceived idea ever) to coming back to "medical science" (  biochem and organic chem   but truthfully i  loathed  anything remotely clinical in my courses and med-wannabes) and now to this strange   mix of computers and biochemistry  .  at other times in my life i have considered  teaching  (mum would keel over with disappointment),  dancing  (that was curtailed a decade ago), being a  translator  (and disappoint my mother),  physiotherapy  (mum said i was too slight for the physical exertion, besides to have to handle people so closely was  bad ), and  interior decorating  (alas it's not a degree program).  a few times recently k has shut me up when we're talking saying, "i'll be making more money than you will."  and it's got me thinking and wondering why i wasn't thinking along those lines when considering what i'm going to aim for for my life.  why didn't i want to be lawyer despite my angst of speaking in public or a dentist or a neurosurgeon?  even when i wanted to be a doctor, i didn't have any idea of the amount of money to be made (i'm more idealistic than that?) and it was a small (if even present) factor in my thoughts.  these days i'm still going for what is  interesting  to me because whatever i pick, i'll be doing it for a  long  time....  i wouldn't have thought that i was  this  idealistic.  so what if i'll be lucky to make half of what my sister makes?  i shouldn't be made to feel bad for that should?  most realistically i always thought i would either be a researcher or be a techie and not have a shabby income and that my husband is a little more go-getter than i ever have been and have a bigger income and we'd never have to worry.  (and we'd still make combined less than my sister.)  i just never thought i'd be thinking, "i'll never make  that  much money," but i guess it's just time for me to think realistically where my life is headed.  and k wondered  why  i wasn't crying on my birthday....   i hate presentations!   had one this morning.  good thing i didn't eat because i would have lost that meal.  it wasn't stellar by far.  at the very least i was prepared to deliver it (which is more than i can say for other times).  so it was okay that way....  before it, i was like a zombie.  it does bad things to me.  so k wondered how i'm to be a researcher if i can't make it through presentations.  then she joked how i'd never have to present if i don't do anything important :(  but i figure i'll get my   presentation legs   in this next year....!

        distractions on the track   on saturday i jogged with sk.  :)  but he's out of shape and stamina and so he jogged 10 to begin with and then 7 more (i think).  and at the prospect of just seeing him walking leisurely on the track while i had  so  many more laps to go, i stopped myself at 27 laps, after taking a break after the 18th.  i'm so bad.... :(  there are so many factors that i could never accurately determine why i was worse off that day, amongst them (1) maybe i was running faster to prove to sk that i've gotten better and then not breathing properly / enough, (2) talking to him was certainly something i'm no longer used to and i lost breath that way, (3) the time of day (an hour later than usual), and (4) the warmth.  ~shrug~  then i jogged alone today.  la-dee-da-dee-da....  it's kind of boring at some parts when i don't particularly enjoy the music.  you'd say, "then write over it!" and find some other music but i'm afraid that if i had nothing but good music, it would be spoiled then.  boring music makes upcoming good music that much more exciting and i anticipate that.  i kinda rest during boring music.  today, i took a break after 18 laps.  this is getting to be an alarming trend.  but i must have been going quite fast today because even with a lap of walking, i managed to finish my 30 laps with the walking lap extra in less than the usual 50 minutes.  let's not get too optimistic and just say i shaved off half a minute off 50 minutes... but there was a 2-minute walking lap, too!  (perhaps i will have a walking lap for a week or two until i truly get used to this increased pace and then phase it out again.)   maybe what i have to do when i grow up to ensure a lifetime of fitness is to join a gym with really fabulous-looking people (read: guys).   at dalplex, those are rare.  at 11:30 there's men's pick-up basketball and i've seen them enough to be bored.  on saturday's there's a group of hk guys playing basketball and a group of korean guys.  i would feel so pedaphilic if i looked for too long that i don't even want to.  every now and then there's someone interesting jogging on the track (i.e., close by, and not downstairs) and that spices things up for the day, thank goodness.  today it really seemed to me like this new (never seen him before) chinese guy (must have only been 21, ewww) couldn't make up his mind between working out (what he came for) or jogging because he came up to jog on three separate occasions and worked out in between.  i know i'm flattering myself and after all, nothing was exchanged - not even eye contact.  after all, i'm too old for him that i should not provoke him (and provoke him i did not) and if he did try to say something to me, my first rushed line would be, "kid, how  old  are you?"  ~sigh~  ok, must stop this blogging break and continue preparing for a presentation tomorrow.  i think i have been traumatized about presentations since my honours presentation.  (bad, bad memories trying to come back.)  so toodle-loo....!

        f5 for 2003-03-14   hehe, it's a bit delayed.  i answered them yesterday in a rush (hence the curt answers) but didn't post because presumably i was too busy finishing up a networking assignment!!  i think i have too much confidence in my ability to write (i.e., confidence in my ability to churn words out under pressure but not necessarily  good  work) that i left so much of the assignment to the day it was due....!  next up: a data mining presentation on tuesday and i'm not so confident of my ability to prepare a presentation (at all!) so i'll get to working on that today.  :(      Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?   yes.  it is adequately personal, usually.   Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  sk, last night.   About how many telephones do you have at home?   a phone in each room.  and a cell phone for each family member.  :p   Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?   yeah.  nothing.  i'll let them learn on their own.   Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?   depends on the person.

       our spontaneous pick for a restaurant for dinner yesterday was mckelvie's, a seafood restaurant we had been to before.   urlLink read about it  in the comments section.   results   so apparently i'm starting to get a  runner's bum .  that's all the more incentive to keep on running.  and i do mean  running .  somehow or other that i can't quantify (because my times aren't significantly diminished from 50 minutes / 5 miles) i really do think i'm jogging faster - into a kind of run.  it really depends on the music i'm listening to.  i suspect that i'm also slowing down sometimes but i know i'll get better.  and then i sprinted the very last lap just to really drain myself out.  it's fun!  i might even be getting those really tight calves (cuz i was feeling myself while stretching :p) though that might take a while because they are just genetically prone to be radishes and curvy.  before the new year, i thought i would get up to 3 jogs a week in the name of "preparing for summer"  (note, nothing exciting is going to happen in the summer: just more school).  little did i know that that little idea has come to fruition!  :)

        birthday entry - happy birthday to me!   i don't usually write my birthday introspective entry until the last minute (and then it's really rushed and not truly introspective).  but this year is slightly different from others and i started early (four days ago).  sure, my sister turns 20, a fifth of a century old later this year but it doesn't have the ring and weight of a   quarter of a century   old.  wow.  i am definitely, finally coming to terms with myself.  you know, i thought the same thing this time last year because i was like, "i like myself, mostly."  actually, i didn't like myself too much, come to think of it.  hating myself, in fact, for the most part, because i was letting my personal life destroy my academic (future) life.  i thought i couldn't really do anything important and i was scared of completion and success.  (i still am: why haven't i looked for a job and started grad school instead?)  last year at this time my school was on a month-long strike so i was a full-time lab rat with dry flaking skin and a glazed look in my eyes....  what a difference a year makes!   changes     body & fashion    i'm getting more conservative: wearing less red and more beige, developing a liking for matronly clothing, developing an aversion to brazen fashion antics a la britney spears, and replacing it with an affinity towards my sister's style - how did she know that when she's so young?  i've grudgingly accept my big wide expanse of a face (thanks to earrings) and i love my body more than i hate it because it's got its limits and i'm pushing them seriously.  i'm not doomed to fatness or chubbiness - i know that now.  i became a jogger last year.  maybe i'll even become a runner but considering i never thought i would be a jogger at all, that's a big change.  even though it's painful at times, i realized that i'm doing it not because i hate my body but because i love it and want to take care of it.  i think it represents that i'm really settling down and accepting quiet and reflection (but still not very reflective).    family    what can i say?  the part that doesn't really change is my arguing with my mother but i appreciate my family so much more.  i think from hanging out with sk i learned to appreciate my family quirks all the more and wouldn't trade them any day with a "normal" family.  nope, my family's got grit and i'm proud of it.  so, i'm much more willing to help out with work, especially since my schedule got relatively lighter (and the pay is good).  i love my family - my sister is my confidante after all is said and done.  as for my extended family, i'm sorry i treated them so badly and i've finally grown up to accept the quirkiness of that family as well, and feel truly sad that we are so far-flung these days.  so my extended family is not particularly cool but they are there for me as well after all is said and done.  i really want to see my other family in vancouver.  maybe it will happen this summer.    social & friends    i really abhor the way i used to go out (i realized that there are so many things to do at home to keep it in order!).  another "social" change: driving like a granny after i got into a minor car accident last year.  i'd rather make sure i'm not out of touch with friends and valuing the most the friends who will stick around.  endurance of a friendship is of the essence.  in my twenty-fourth year (rather, just before it), p and i suffered (for a month or two) a rift and he cared about me so much he called me up and made sure that i stayed in touch with him because  staying in touch with p = staying on track .  and then, sadly, in may, we could no longer have the daily emails that i once bemoaned and we had a three-month period of email-silence followed by a flouris of writing in letters.  that was great.  :)  ironically, we became closer because of the divide and because both he and i are getting old and peaceful and conservative and compromising... finally!  i love him so much.    relationship    i learned that i can be loved, that i can love in return, and relearned how love and brighten your day and make everything seem better.  this birthday i approach a bit more solemnly than others.  honestly, i wasn't one of those who was going to find the love of my life in my undergrad years because i was still growing up but it's a little sad and mildly scary to be 25 and not a marriage prospect in sight.  i don't want to be 30 and single and that really seems to be around the corner.   constants (so far)   i'm still conscientious - more so than before, i think.  i'm still undisciplined at the core and shock myself every now and then how badly undisciplined i can be.  i'm still a walking contradiction: a stress-free panic-monger, intense about nothing, and a meticulous slacker.  i'm competitive to a fault.  and i'm still looking for someone to settle down with.  while at that, though, i'm still a master of charm - i can still make a guy go crazy but i only want  one  guy to go crazy... and only in a good way.  i'm still struggling wtih my chinese identity.  like clockwork, it comes up to bite me every month or so.  maybe it will get figured out this year.    personal    i was uncertain about my abilities last year but eventually overcame these mental blocks (and graduated!).  i still get confidence these days from accomplishing what i have accomplished and that eases the difficulties that i currently face.  i realized that there is something to be said for getting to this age.  i am looking forward to monday the 10th more than i ever have because i'm out of my uncertain early twenties.  the next five years are going to be okay - i mean, i learned that i'm not growing old alone and that i'm going to ripen into something good and decent.  that is really comforting thought and something to look forward to.

        new hp front   yup, just updated my  urlLink webpage  on the cs server.  i should get one of those site meters and see who comes to my page (if ever).  i don't ever do it to draw traffic (most people, i know, because they later tell me, are cs students who meet me and wonder if i have page and it's not hard to find given my email address).  i just do it for my own satisfaction that i can have a creative (to my limit), colourful, little corner space.  so there.

        jogging music   on friday, i was too lazy to go jogging.  because i go on monday and wednesday right after class at 10:30, i wanted a gift to myself: a morning off.  so it was  so sweet  to be so lazy that morning and then i had to go jogging this morning.  :p  it was alright except for the track practice that was winding down by the time i arrived - good, knowing that, i won't be going on sat. mornings and will go mwf at 10:30, as my  urlLink schedule  says anyways....  i complained to someone (can't remember who) about how bored i am with jogging.  thirty little laps, in the same order of inside and outside laps, same music....  i'm slightly lazy to go change the mp3s on my mp3 player (sorry, p, :(  )  but part of it also is because i think i've found a winner for music:  vanessa mae .  i mean rnb and hip-hop quickly become boring and date.  i have her album "storm" and some other japanese and chinese music that i never get to anyways during a 50-minute run.  it's a  rut  but it's okay.  here are some of the landmarks:    i don't think i can hear  "summer haze"  (track 1) without thinking of starting up jogging.  i love making such associations.    "storm"  (track 2) reminds me of the charm diamond commercial in some parts.  very majestic, and keeps me going through the hard part of starting up!   i should be just starting lap 8 and jog this lucky lap with   "bach street prelude"   (track 4).  i don't know what it is about it, but it sounds like she's playing her violin outdoors and dancing on a car....  maybe i saw a video or something.  but at once, i feel like i'm outside as well, jogging by the car she is dancing on.    "leyenda"  is a "latin" piece that reminds me of toni braxton's "spanish guitar" that is wistful to begin with.  but there's this part where there is a break in the music and a spanish man cries out something and she smacks her violin and starts playing again.  i look forward to this part of the music, hanging in anticipating.   i always accelerate and keep pace with  "(i) can, can (you)?"  (track 6)which has that can-can riff in it, and that pushes me when i'm just about near the half-hour mark.    "a poet's quest (for a distant paradise)"  "happy valley"   (track 7) reminds me of an "lotr" elf wedding through misty woods.  who in their right minds would agree to that kind of wedding with me??!!  and then the music takes me from jogging (floating) through misty woods to a cathedral with ceilings touching the sky and monks chanting for my procession....  cool.  :)   either in  "embrasse-moi (you fly me up)"  "a poet's quest (for a distant paradise)"   (track 8) or  "aurora"  "embrasse-moi (you fly me up)"   (track 9) - probably the former - i envision being taken onto a gondola for a ride to a distant water-setting candle-lite dinner with my handsome hunk of choice.   okay , since that is not exactly my recurring fantasy, i don't care too much for these two songs and it's a struggle to get through, unfortunately!    "i feel love"  "aurora"   (track 10) is a bit like a rave song and so i see myself dancing (read: flailing my arms) and it's all cool because i'm small and lithe, right, from jogging!   finally, i know it's the home stretch for the last two laps that i hear  "hocus pocus"  "i'm a doun"   (track 11) that is fast-paced.  actually, i think i'm nearly breaking a run on the last two-and-a-half laps these days because then they will just go by faster!    gee, it seems as if every song has formed in impression on me after who knows how many jogs with them in the same order, so far.  so, with that said, if you take away the music and try to get me used to something else, i don't know if i can do it!!   maybe a rut is good.    someone's getting old....   i'll point out the obvious that i'm posting on a saturday night @ 9 p.m.  and no, i don't have any plans to go out.  i'm  perfectly happy  with this situation.  sm is leaving tomorrow and he's going to pacifico.  i kind of deliberately didn't bring a change of clothes and my excuse is that i don't want to go home and change - i just dont' want to go.  thursday night was plenty enough for me to see the scene.  maybe i'll even do some school work after meticulously cleaning up my blog entry.  or maybe i'll just go home and be perfectly content to spend the evening at home.    yup, someone's getting old.  :p

        what to do on a thursday night?   that was the pressing question of last night....  as is becoming the routine it seems, i had to work yesterday night - meaning hurrying back to the darkside (dartmouth) in the afternoon and lending my parents a hand.  one employee that would greatly alleviate the work for my parents is out injured for a month so... i am not grumbling too much for having to work.  actually i am. i had all the means to be a good waitress and all else but, you see, my parents can only cook one thing at a time and things came out slowly.  man, i can get so pissed off when working because of the people i have to deal with and i get into arguments with my parents because i don't like getting stressed out and i was last night!  so, i went out on a thursday night for the first time in ages.... met up with sm at  thirsty duck  that is a drinking hole by my standards.  been there for nachos once before.  it was quiet (except for the band playing: universal language or some other thing like that) because the rush of kids were at  yfm  - yes, and i do mean kids because i know 16-years-old sneaking in.  we then went to  pitchman's pub  after passing by  argyle  that was empty on the top level at 11 p.m.  pitchman's, i have been told, is the new  j.j.'s  a cruddy bar that so fortunately shut down when its location was bought by the art college to turn it into a residence last summer.  sleazy bar (and i'm a bad one for identifying sleaze, i.e., tolerating) with popular music and notorious for its attraction of underage drunk girls and underage drunk guys.  it was so incomprehensibly popular you'd think the floor would break before it closed.  it truly is the new j.j.'s and one of our friends started getting a bad feeling soon after we paid $5 cover. (rip-off!  even the cashier conceded so.)  so he left and sm and i waded through the waves of drunken little people - girls in the same franchise "clubbing" tops and guys who are so young and loud!  we found the quietest place in the bar - a room quite insulated from the music so you just hear thuds as if a car blasting music with a big subwoofer / amp / whatever.  i really  wonder  what attracted the horders to pitchman's (and when) and why / how / when the argyle faded as the place to be on thursday nights.    i attribute it to the people of hali having a considerable lack of taste and great taste only for cheap drinks and eww-places.    we went to argyle after finishing our drinks which was the original destination because some mba-guy was celebrating his birthday.  i hadn't before seen the "aqua lounge" that was their formerly packed and sweaty lower-level dancing lounge.  it was comfortingly non-packed (could have used  some  more people) and certainly delightfully more mature filled with only mba people even if they aren't necessarily disinclined to drink.  i like the renovation to the argyle bar - swanky, shiny mahogany (well, in the dim light) and the "aqua" lounge is lava-lamp fluid but in a more refreshingly water-theme.  (there's the projection of water running over the floor and seats and floor-to-ceiling billowing black curtains creating divides between seating eat areas.)  for a thursday night, we had the other options of going to  copa  that is thursday hip-hop and the new  party house .  i'm certain that despite my angst of p.h., it would be more welcoming site than the crowd at pitchman's.  we could have gone to  velvet olive  that is another "classy" place.  thursdays are popular and "rock n roll" night or something.  it's do difficult to please everyone at once!  i think it turned my stomach the most to see people treating a thursday night (what about school on friday??) like a clubbing night, getting drunk, and "dressing up."  kids will be kids, sigh, and  please  keep them away from me!

        f5 for 2003-03-07       what was the last song you heard?   yan-zi sun's "weird" from her "to be continued" album.  it samples indian music in the beginning and end and tribal kinda chinese music throughout the rest of the song.  really great and energetic!  that's why i kept replaying the song while driving home tonight!   what were the last two movies you saw?    my big fat greek wedding  (it was really good and i recommend to anyone) and, sad to say,  back to the future: part ii  (not the entire thing, but certainly enough!)   what were the last three things you purchased?   cover @ pitchman's pub, white hot chocolate from second cup at school, medium tea from tim horton's: double-single with milk.   what four things do you need to do this weekend?   do my networking assignment, work at the restaurant two nights, hook up with sm, and deliberate about dm.   who are the last five people you talked to?   mum when i came home, sk on his voice mail, sm who came out tonight, and v and m.

       dinner tonight with sm and sf @  curry village  (previously reviewed, and i've added today's comment to that review).  yum-yum.  sm recalled how gw broke a sweat when we three went there last.  this time,  i  broke a sweat.  sf was like this is what he eats at home and sm was so cool.  i had to empty sm's glass of water in addition to two of my own!   thai chin   on saturday, after some of my non-discreet raving and wishing, sk took me to  thai chin  a "new" "restaurant" "by"  taj mahal .  taj was advertising the impending opening of thai chin for some time so i knew they were affiliated some how but i did not know how closely until saturday: thai chin is the once solarium room of taj mahal.  i recently came across an entertainment guide to hali and in it a menu for thai chin.  my mouth watered at the thought of various advertised hakka dishes which made me so eager to try the place out.  however, unfortunately, when we were there, the real menu indicated that the menu is still in progress and what is currently available is only thai food and some chinese food that i would not dream of trying there anyways.  (no green curry no green curry no green curry....)  i ordered for us a green papaya salad (6.95 or something) while we decided what else to order.  sk selected a pineapple shrimp curry (14.95) and i chose three pagodas chicken (10.95) and we ordered one order of rice (3.95).  i also ordered mango shake (3.95, tastes like it was made with yogurt) while sk ordered a mango driver (5.95, mango juice & vodka).  i ordered papaya salad because that's a  cool  dish to eat.  (i remember when p had one in his car before one was ever available in hali and that was probably the best papaya salad that i've never eaten.)  little did i know there was overwhelming coriander in it - the menu lied.  :(  pineapple shrimp curry was much like sweet & sour dish with runny sauce that i'm all too familiar with.  but the shrimp was not battered and there was a thai-tang to it - that's the only way i can describe it!  even though i did not order green curry, there was something unpleasantly familiar tasting about three pagodas that i  thought  they had slipped me green curry instead (except the curry was red).  it had a soapy / detergent scent that i could barely bear.  the environment of thai chin can not be berated as much as that for taj mahal (proper, and all that it currently is) because the solarium room is far nicer and classier compared to the other obnoxious dining room.  our server (never seen her there before) was a really sweet girl - they do have very polite and proper servers except for the really loud one from last time....   (three point eight / five)    yikes (mcdonald's)   if i had checked out the  urlLink nutritional value  of mcdonald's meals, i probably would have saved myself from  a lot  of this junk!  you see, i'm a complete and total mcdonald's breakfast junkie.  my favourite breakfast is sausage 'n' egg mcmuffin (450 calories, 28 g fat) with a hashbrown (180 calories, 8 g fat) or two.  :p  i mean, i'm not a calorie counter or anything (can't be bothered and half of it would be left blank because i'm guessing about the caloric content of my mother's meals....) but learning that (a few weeks ago, browsing while waiting in a restaurant), has really deterred me from getting breakfast again....  it goes back to me being irrationally scared of the some irreversible effect of me having such a deplorably junk meal!  i have a confession: when i worked in toronto, i had a metropass (or whatever they called it there) and could hop on and off subways and buses at my leisure.  there was a term (one of my best in recollection) where i was a member of the y and after a workout at 6 a.m., i would head to work and there was a mcd's at the intersection where i worked (or any any intersection where there was a subway station for that matter) and so i became an all-out mcdonald's breakfast junkie that term.

        jogging in a nightmare   i had a nightmare of a weekend.  you know.  and this morning while jogging my legs felt about as heavy as my heart did.  i thought i was going to quit after 20 minutes but.... forged on somehow.  (it's called knowing that i have all the energy i need from having breakfast and enough sleep and literally no excuse to not complete it.)  amazingly when i was overtaking this girl on Lap 14, my legs started to feel lighter, like i was not longer lumbering as loudly as the 6-foot guy who has an excuse to lumber because he is about 100 pounds heavier than me, maybe.  i felt like i had legs belonging to someone else and kept up with this for a lap or two and then it inevitably when away....  i got scared because i didn't feel like jogging.  and that made me wonder how much of my jogging is because i want to have a nice body for someone.  and if someone's gone, why don't i just go into sedentary hiding and just starve myself to stay thin?  well, i reasoned that i will find love again (almost a certainty) and because i do it (mostly?) to be healthier.  it's also scary the current bruises and pains i've been getting.  if i weren't jogging, i'd be pain-free.  ironic, isn't it?  to overcome this rut i'm having, my goal is to (slowly) increase my speed, maybe shave a minute or two off a run (and get to a run at some point!).   my big fat greek wedding   finally saw the movie over the weekend and liked it  a lot .  my favourite part that hit me the most: his proposal.  i don't know, it was so run-of-the-mill place, like when you're older, all that matters is that there is a proposal, finding someone you can spend the life with and not some glitzy locale like a fancy restaurant or spectacular nature setting.  it is a bit idealistic movie, but it was really, truly good and fun.  on that note, i checked out  my big fat greek life  for a few minutes on sunday.  i thought i would give it five minutes but it turned out that i didn't even need so long to assess the new show.  it makes you wonder if most of the original cast is also in the sitcom (including the lead actress).  it was terrible and become normal.  the jokes were (instantly to me) bad and it seems sad that now they have to pause after ever joke (apparently every line is funny) for some contrived audience laughter....!  well, at least it's good to know that i won't be wasting my time on that show!

        I LIKE MY BODY   (1045) originally penned feb.26 @ dalplex before a jog.  so, i was looking towards today's (upcoming) jog with some dread.  i don't get tired - i get  bored .  bored of 30 laps (9 one way, 9 the other way, 6 the first way, 6 the other way) around the same track.  bored that i've been at this since may (9 months ago) and i wonder seriously where my runner's bum / calves / hips are hiding.  mind you, i don't intend to quit at all.  but before i embark on a jog today, i realize that i truly like my body.  these days i like my toes with ample toenails and my fingers that i used to find so blah (not cute, not long and slender).  i don't chew my nails so much and i've fortunately stopped with ample nail left as well.  i don't mind my head shape (thanks mostly to earrings) or my eyebrows (now that's been a hate relationship for a few years) and even my fleshy arms and bum (god knows if that will really change).  i'm no anorexic beauty.   a curvaceous pixie , maybe.  i want to wear strappy tank tops and skinny tops because i don't have roll s  on my belly.  i want to wear a really short skirt or slip dress and strappy sandals.  (how much is this winter blues talking?)  i want to show off my shoulders (strong) and legs (muscular).  i want to go clubbing.  i want pictures of me today and yesterday and tomorrow.  these days i've gone slightly conservative (but always dressy) in my dress.  not so much clubbing-cum-daywear out of practicality.  so i want to  show it off .  i'm scared of losing it.  i'm scared of 4-week break from school and i get fatter for not jogging and eating as much as i want.  i'm scared of getting injured and being side-lined.  i'm scared of having (a) kid(s) and what that will do to my body.  i'm scared of growing old and facing inevitable changes.  i'm as tall today as i ever will be.  so, i can just jog today, and two days from now... and take care of myself from day to day.  (1350) postcripts  (1) heh, when i went to jog, there was a running coach coaching a mother and daughter.  the daughter was at least 16 years old so i had some hope that i can regain my body after having a kid or two.  (2) how's this sound for instilling motivation to not quit: participating in a marathon (a short one!).  gotta see what there is (and when) this summer and that could become a reality.  (2213 mar. 2'03)  (3) i just posted a bunch of pictures from recent and from further ago.   urlLink check 'em out .

        schedule !@#$ 1    how many other people were filling out their income tax returns today with the deadline quickly approaching....?  it's not like i'm not capable of doing it and didn't do it when i was living on my own but it seems more efficient to let my mother (the professional accounts person in the household) to do the family's income taxes.  then she can "measure" things - mainly to figure out what is the most advantageous education amount to transfer - so the whole family benefits.  so imagine my dismay at 2:30 p.m. - a few hours from the deadline - when she throws her hands up and exclaims she gives up on my return shows me my stack of T-whatever slips to wade through for myself in the space of a couple of hours!  i swear some really funky math sh-- is going on in those forms and schedules.  why on earth do i keep on getting the same numbers over and over?  i never bothered to figure this out because you can basically turn off your brain and follow the inane instructions like a monkey and churn out some numbers, hoping that some add up higher or lower so you don't have to pay taxes.  i characterized it a bit like  magic  but other times like some kind of  sadistic game  being played on tax-payers.  there seem to be subtle differences from last year's but who would remember that far back to that ordeal??  good riddance that is done and i can imagine all across canada a big wave of sighs of relief!

         much anticipated night out with andrew :)        he suggested at first that we go to  5 fishermen  because of a commercial he saw for it.  in the commercial they reveal that the current restaurant is located on a former-hospital and morgue.  as a result, some waitstaff in the commercial claim to have had encounters of the ghostly kind relating a tales of being assaulted (slapped on the face) by thin air and andrew said another waiter thought he was talking to a patron and found it odd that his co-workers were laughing at him.  they told him he was talking to no one and that was true - his companion had vanished!  ~brr !!~  freaky story!  and i fell for the commercial and agreed to go there despite the possibility of encountering a ghost!  and  sometimes  i like to accomodate my friends and since it was his suggestion (and it wasn't too cruddy) i would agree to try something i would not otherwise try on my own.  so many times i have gone to the dome (and despised it) and never noticed that the restaurant (closed) that we stood in front of was 5 fisherman & one called  little fish restaurant and oyster bar .  the concept is like that i saw at  salty's  where you have a fancy dining room upstairs (5 fishermen) with main courses starting at $25 (not miserly artsy fare, but nothing below this rate) and a more down-to-earth restaurant on the main / street level.  although the dishes upstairs sounded more tantalizing and the fact that all main courses come with all-you-can-eat mussel and salad bar to sweeten the deal, we decided to stay downstairs where we could also get a limited number of mussels.  we ordered steamed mussels in the house blend of thirteen herbs and spices to start (6.95).  i ordered oyster "poh boy" sandwich (11.95) and andrew ordered the chicken mushroom fettucine (11.95).  steamed mussels were good.  we got about a pound (no set amount was promised) and the fun part came in guessing the herbs and spices used.  (compared to a plain old tomato basil garlic sauce that was the alternative to 13 herbs.)  we could tell that the concoction consisted of at least curry powder, ginger, and onions.  i would have done quite well if we had ordered  two  pounds of mussels instead!  for my entree, i got about six pieces of battered oysters laid on a bed of lettuce and tartar sauce on a chewy baguette stick next to a mountain of shoestring fries and coleslaw (the latter was not so good).  the coleslaw was not so great so i was confined to the oyster sandwich and fries.  oysters were good and ample lemon slices.  andrew's pasta did not quite look ample in size (given i'm a pasta-monster) but it did look good in a wild mushroom's darker creamy tint.  we passed on desserts because a quick glance at the dessert menu revealed nothing interesting.  there were very traditional desserts like apple crumble and blueberry buckle (??), caramel brulee and the obligatory "cheesecake of the day."  there were ample staff present for the two restaurants and they were jovial in a can't-offend-them trained-for-tourists way.  while we never saw upstairs (supposedly a predominance of brass in the furnishings), the ground level was a decent restaurant in hip and modern decor and style and service.  someday we would like to visit upstairs which would from the same kitchen produce less run-of-the-mill dishes... and that mussel bar!  address: 1740 argyle street, halifax, ns hours: 5 - 11 pm daily website:  urlLink 5 fishermen    (four point three / five)   after dinner we watched  identity .  i'm the  biggest baby  in the world and before we walked in, i was prepared for a fright-fest and only agreed to a suspenseful thriller kind of film because half a lifetime ago i got to choose the movie and i choose  bridget jones' diary .  the thing about thrillers is that they actually have some really interesting stories.  i caught the story from behind my curtain of fingers and with my trick of facing the movie screen but  not  looking at the screen.  i can honestly say that i didn't see anything part of that movie that freaked me out.  :)

        this weekend   i'll tell you about this weekend now that it is over.  it is sad that what i thought i would be doing didn't happen.  and finding myself saddened by it, but then i get mad at myself because, really, it's pretty idiotic stuff to be whining about....   friday:  worked and then went to  urlLink fireside  with angus.  i got a yummy, yummy 'bello burger.  the thought of that was making me hungry when i was at work!  friday nights there are busy (no surprise) but the low-key atmosphere was decidedly overturned and when we ended, some very loud music was playing.  i'm sensitive to loud, pop (alterna-rock) music that is so mainstream.  he sometimes tells me stuff that should not be repeated for fear of smearing someone else or himself.  i have this natural desire to share some of it (have to educate my younger sister, right?) but stop myself with the question, "does anyone else care so much?  should they?"  and so some damaging stuff, still i only know.   saturday:  arrived at school super-early because my crazy sister wanted to have a full hour to study for her final.  went to  step aerobics .  wow, it's been a while since my last aerobics class and it was pretty rough.  :p  after my sister finished her last final exam and we went to the new  urlLink cora's breakfast & lunch  for a quickie and yummy breakfast meal.  (follow the link for my review!)  then we went "shopping" around bayers lake and then to work.  i waited at home for angus to call me but otherwise was too lazy to start getting ready and chatted with other friends all headed to  the dome .  i feel kinda hypocritical because i make no secret of despising that place but i was willing to go again because a different group was going.  i wanted to know what it was like to go and hang out with them....  anyways, he called and it wasn't a go and i decided to stay home and watch  urlLink mansfield park  with my sister.  (quickie review of the movie: it was horribly fast pace and i pity my sister who could not appreciate what she struggled to follow.  maybe i missed it in the novel but i thought all the bertrams would be fair and not dark-haired... oh well.  i pity my mother who couldn't tell the girls straight because they all looked similar from the surface.  it wasn't as subtle as the novel - who is surprised? - but otherwise is an acceptably true adaptation of the novel.  they took a few liberties in gratuity that shocked me after enjoying such adaptations as  emma  but  mansfield  was a darker novel.  i read some reviews comparing the 2-hour movie i saw with the older mini-series and can agree that they didn't have enough time to address everything i felt sweet and informative about the novel.  it swept through the story and had this awful tagline, "i suppose things could have turned out very differently... but they didn't."  what's with that??)  andrew called me around midnight and invited me out to  the argyle  with the chemistry crowd.  how i would have gone but it was midnight when he called (he thought it was still ten p.m.).  oh well, no one's ever died from spending a weekend in and i can attest that it isn't so bad....   sunday : early morning :p dance practice for the kick-off of asian heritage month (may) later this week.  i'm pleased as punch about being part of a  dance troupe  and approach the group aspect of it as i usually do: making it to every practice and on time, holding up my part (learning the steps), and giving suggestions hopefully to the benefit of everyone.  i think we're a talented group and we are the most original performance at multicultural festival.  it's too bad that we can't have a slightly longer performance than the length of one song.  (other groups have looonnnng medleys and boy are they boring.)  dancing and performing is definitely something i want to continue doing... hopefully it won't become too stodgy as i become older... or perhaps i can make sure my future group keeps it... enticing.   monday : really lazy day (last one!) wherein nothing over  ten dollars  was spent.  i got my hair cut and since it wasn't anything special, i went to "first choice haircutters" and realized that the system is so different from the pampering i receive at  life salon and spa .  to marvel at their operation would betray how utterly sheltered and snobby i have become (like how we sat so quietly waiting for our turn watching the people who came before us, how there is no receptionist to take the continuously ringing phone so the hairdressers in turn stopped their cutting and answer the phone).  the haircut was ten dollars.  as usual i was fearful that it was not what i imagined in my head, that i wasn't cut enough but it is to my satisfaction.  then k and i went shopping and at a sale at fairweaters, a black velvety jogging jacket and black velvety clubbing top could be got for ten dollars each.  went for desserts with mona at  la cave .  it's unbelievably refreshing and nice to have just-girls time.  :)  )  (review of  la cave :  i've been there more than half a dozen times and haven't officially reviewed it yet!  located on blowers street in downtown halifax and with it's cavelike decor and maze, it is consistently rated as halifax's best "date place" or "dessert place" or "romantic spot."  nearly everyone gets a private or semi-private room.  you can imagine in the dimly lit alcoves that many an engagement has been formed and other sorts of uninnocent canoodling.  :p  can't comment exactly about their food except it's a bit pricy.  i've tried out their spinach dip with pita dippers that runs around $10 and quite fun to share.  they offer an variety of appetizes and main courses, but it's their dessert selection that they are most famous for.  a cake display is located near the entrance so you may decide before you sit "out back" which cheesecake you want.  there are many chocolate varieties: black forest, cookies n cream, double chocolate, tiramisu, you name it.  i am most partial towards the fruit-topping cheesecake because the cheesecake is plain - no swirls of chocolate or fruit.  they also offer pecan flans, huge homemade turtles, cakes - i ordered zucotto - and a fruit cocktail in ice wine and brandy.  desserts all run around $5 or 6.  all that is missing is gelato, but no one's actually complaining.  you can hang out at la cave for extremely long time - i think the waitstaff half expects it - girls who come in to chat for all night or couples come in to chat....  the hours are long especially on the fridays and saturdays but ridiculously short on sundays.  (four point seven / five) )

        not so slack, i think   working at the restaurant isn't the least bit intellectually challenging but it's doing my good daughterly duty to ungrudgingly work for entire shifts (as opposed to working only a few hours) because very soon i'll be selfish again when i start up school again....  this time (compared to last summer where i was saving up for shopping in toronto) i have the very unromantic goal of paying off my credit card bill and saving up a few pennies.  :p  in the summer, i'm extraordinarily excited to be taking  advanced web programming .  i need a second course and it could be either parallel computing (eek!) or artificial neural networks (never thought i'd consider it but here i am....) or intelligent systems.  i first considered software engineering (snore) but i'm  through  with taking courses just because i'll survive them but hate them with a passionate throughout it all.  finally finished  urlLink mansfield park  and mona (who delightfully shares my love for jane austen novels) was right about everything happening in the last 20 pages of the novel!  it was great, so satisfying as usual.  :)  (now i want to see the  urlLink movie !!)  now i'm reading  urlLink neuromancer  which is an ultra-classic uber-geek sci-fi novel to read.  it is, as the bookcover says "a mind binder."  but fun, certainly different from mansfield park.  :p  the problem for me is i have no idea what to read that has been recently written - and so my choice of reading gets to be somewhat random.  i don't actually know exactly what i'm interested in reading (okay, for certain some asian-american literature but not the freaked out ghosts-stuff.  and very selected sci-fi: this girl doesn't want to be stuck reading a long series either.)  i hardly watch movies so i read movie reviews and  urlLink enterprise reviews  and compared to those, i don't have much interest in reading book reviews... or perhaps i haven't found a compelling enough reviewer that i can trust... who sents the periodic and occasional review directly to my email account....  paul called me and gave me a really big moral boost for my soul-searching - er, supervisor-hunting... thank you!!  :)

        seriously though   went jogging on wednesday for  20 whole minutes  before retiring and participating in a  body trim  (read: strength training) class.  i was kind of hoping it was be an step aerobics class i was dropping into but, hey, toning is good for me, too!  then played  badminton  for another hour or so.  in singles games, i beat gunther but yang beat me.  gunther  nearly  had yang but eventually he lost.  so yang is like king of the court and gunther only lost today to me because he was having an exceedingly bad day.   i am not defined by being able to run 30 laps in a row.   (though i would  so  love to get back to that.  i did it last week - with breaks - when i went and the guys were playing basketball and i had nothing to do if i stopped jogging early.  i  think  30 laps is going to always be there so long as i don't quit jogging and don't fall to, say, 20% of that.)   i am not defined by my love or ability in badminton.   (though i want to maintain a certain level and have really awesome and properly trained badminton-playing kid(s).)  i am supposed to be looking for a supervisor these days and find myself in something of a quandry (besides being exceedingly lazy).  my confidence in my biochemistry and chemistry background is non-existent.  that is the beauty of doing a combined honours: having huge holes in my basic knowledge because i simply didn't want to take those courses and you can do that when having two honours subjects.  to concentrate strictly on the negatives, i haven't any semblence of a background beyond second or third year in the following:    analytical, physical, or organic chemistry (yup, that would leave only organic and i was really sucky at that)  intermediate metabolism and  anything  to do with lipids or hormones or signal transduction (~shivers)  clinical biochemistry... wouldn't stick in my head for the life of me  rigorous stats or even the basics of ai (artificial intelligence)    on the bright side (oh this is harder to fill out), i....    have a very carefully honed education in the determination of structure of molecules with a decided prefered interest in biological molecules  can remember everything i've learned in computer science (either it's too easy or i'm just more inclined that way, unfortunately??)  have the advantage of being explosed to more topics than usual (physics, match, stats, biology, immunology....), which could be of great benefit    what's important is the ability to learn right....?  i very often have doubts of my having anything ressembling even average abilities to do that....  paul wants me to have a really significant project for my master's and it's so wonderful of him to want only good things for me.  i'm flip-flopping: between    the possibility of an "easier" computer science-type project that  any  run-of-the-mill strictly-computer science student can do because my biochem/chem background is fading, maybe one that is "medial informatics" (but i didn't take biochem in order to do health data administration!!)  getting myself into a really big and exciting biochemistry lab and doing a real bioinformatics project and facing (and overcoming?) all those topics in biochemistry that i've thus far survived while avoiding....    sigh, this is a depressing post but not posting is also hindering on my work so... here goes....

         keeping busy     but not overly so....  clubbing last weekend....   thursday : thought we were going to  copacabana  because thursday is hip-hop night but word has it that it's been dead for the past couple of thursdays and i wasn't informed until we set out (12:30-ish) that we were heading for  the dome  instead of copa for the usual dome-madness.  i don't understand the craze that comes with long weekends....  it was a jam-packed house and as usual i didn't like it.   how do i hate the dome, let me count the ways....      went upstairs to check out the scene (we got separated from richard and steve and i wanted the bird's eye view to find them again) and Old Guy that i accidentally got too close to tries to talk to me.  don't know what he said, i scooted to the end of the viewing area...  african guy i end up next to called Ishkad or something takes that as a sign that we can be friends and begs and begs for my phone number, "how can we be friends if you don't give me your phone number??"  i thought of passing off the phone number of a person i don't like but couldn't think of one....  took a breather and sat at a table near one of the bars; guy who later is obviously trying to pick up any girl that is in the bar vicinity offers to buy me a drink.  i decline.  i think he said, "are you sure?"  yes i'm sure!  still at the bar: drunk redneck reels towards me and tries to talk to me, "i feel like cattle in here."  good for you.  he's from petawawa.  whoa - bad, bad vibes - don't want petawawa-ness to in the slightest bit influence me so when he went for another drink, i took off.  when this reggae song (don't know which one, guy says "shake that thang" over and over) draws a full crowd to the dance floor and some guys think it's legitimate in such a rousing song to put their hands on single-girls' hips and  press .  eww - i don't know if i batted off the hands of two guys or the same guy over twice.     saturday : too tramatized from the dome, i refused to go there again.  we ended up at  merrill's  first.  i remarked upon first entering that  that  was the kind of crowd that suited me: more sparse.  but as we walked around, i realized that it was depressingly sparse.  i'm still kind of cool with that because then when they do play something current and popular, i don't have to groan at the masses descending on the dance floor because there were not masses in attendence.  thuy and i sat and talked and took pictures with her digital camera (we'll get better pics next time, none to show this time).  we couldn't help but see the girl at the next table in turn grind with a guy and then make out with a girl.  one of the girls we later saw making out with a different girl.  (note: i'm not against whatever orientation the girls chose to be, i am simply against such brazen displays of promiscuity and i don't forgive even the display of sexuality by a straight couple.  not even at a club.)  even the guys when they arrived couldn't stomach the scene.  there was a laser light show which (sorry: sheltered me) i haven't seen before and thought was pretty neat to be in the midst of it.  we all danced a bit and then left.  thuy and yang wanted to go to the dome and hung and i would rather just call it a night.  we ended up at  perks  and had coffee and drinks and dessert and talked and laughed and joked and i thought it was  perfect .  i'm afraid that thuy and yang are still not inclined to think the end of the evening so nicely as i did....  :(  sorry; so i promised yang in the near future all-night at pacifico some saturday.  he doesn't think i will come through but i really want to.   sunday : grr, it's difficult to find a place open after 10 p.m. on a sunday night for just drinks and stuff besides second cup.  i wanted to take angus-who-is-leaving-soon to some place he doesn't usually go to so he can take home nice memories of hali.  with nothing being open we ended up at a spot he usually ends up at - gatsby's.  so it was nice to just hang out there and get out but not go anywhere lewd and crap.  plan for this coming weekend:    thursday: work.  haven't been to yfm for wings in ages but might swap a shift with my sister when she's done exams to swing that.  friday: day @ home... what mischief will arise?  work.  then going out for drinks.  saturday: jogging really early in the morning.  work.  then tentatively some kind of clubbing that i haven't taken part in in years... details if it happens.  sunday: dance practice (hope i can get up for it!).  work.  and vinnie and i talked about going clubbing on sunday.  we might even go to  the palace  (notorious for being the sleaziest place), and i've never been out on a sunday night before as i recall....

        sign my guestmap!         from the wonderful people at  urlLink bravenet.com   (grrr, do you get that annoying pop-up when you close the guestmap window??  the "price" of getting something free, unfortunately!)  site search..... not yet working (10:54 a.m.)  .... too many pop-up ads!  and i don't particularly want to unleash that on my poor 5 readers so the site search is gone.  perhaps i will learn how to write my own in the course of this summer's advanced web course??

         t ogether  e veryone  a chieves  m ore   so... it's that time of the year again. you know... when you've given it your all on exams and projects and stuff (or maybe just close to your all) and then you have to sit back and  wait  for the results to roll in.  i can't even remember this experience from four months ago - why don't i recall being so nervous or something?  i had this feeling  always  in undergrad, wait in fear that i didn't make a b-minus an organic chemistry course.  i only ever feared for org. because throughout the term i would get less than that cut-off mark.  it would have been as bad as failing the course in my situation: org. in particular wasn't required but i needed at least a b-minus for courses for my honours subjects, missing that mark would require some serious juggling to fill an already-packed schedule with another honours course....  so it was always like this  big sigh of relief  when i got a b or b-minus (or a b-plus!!) in organic chem after all!!  it's not like i was getting crappy marks in the term in any of my courses but my standards have definitely gone up because my peers (masters students) are so hard working!  TEAMwork is what i'm actually trying to get at (if you missed it in the title)....  i'm actually a loner when it comes down to it.  i like to solve things on my own and asking for help has always petrified me.  when i was in biochem, i avoided the medical library where my classmates studied.  i studied at the science library sometimes and more often at the computer science building where i was at home, free of the risk of running into my classmates, and with the bonus that what i was studying was  so  different from what the people around me studied.  now i'm in computer science and you could hardly catch me studying in the computer science building.  i'm back at the science library or maybe even the law library where i fancy the students there are infinitely more mature and studious (but aren't necessarily).  then in data mining i actually had to ask to join a group and that was a first-time for wyn and boy did that feel like an "audition": gable said to me, "if you don't mind working hard, then you can join the group."  and it all being a first-time thing, i was seriously wondering if i was hard-working enough for the group!!  in networking my group was practically built-in because i knew  one  person in the class going into the class.  when we picked a project involving an experiment, i thought, "boys and their toys.  i don't want to have any thing to do with experimentation."  so i totally offered to do background reading.   a lot  of it.  all i wanted was to pull my load to everyone's satisfaction and not come out with a bad rep for group-working (seeing as i don't prefer it).  so happily i think i got (and gave back) even more.  i didn't slack too much except when it seemed okay to (like before, but not during, the final crunch).   and i've cultivated a reputation of being a sort of writer.   (ai me, i'm not, though: i really, really suck at writing.  my sister's writing blows mine out of the water, it is so good.  my honours thesis was marginally better than my third year massive organic chem reports which were worse than i suspect any report i wrote in engineering and those still paled by comparison to my writing in high school.)  my data mining group didn't think much of me as a  programmer  going in because i'll loudly proclaim my biochem background but i think their minds (and my own!) where changed from that experience.  i learned  it's okay to ask for help  (and cried loudly for it a few times to the dm mailing list!).  after the data mining report was submitted mei and i sat and mulled happily about how it was a great feeling to get all that over with.  she thanked me and i thanked her for our hard work (especially that final day!) - it was all very, very sweet.  i think another thing i gained from it is  "the grad student experience" .  i can't exactly quantify what the grad student experience is.  i guess i felt it most while working in a group because we're all getting the same mark together and so we all want to help each other as much as possible.  otherwise, i don't feel like graduate studies is a whole lot less cut-throat than undergrad science was - the standards are even higher at this level that you hear even middling students in their undergrad putting more pressure on themselves.  they say it's meeting people similar interests - i think it's meeting people who are more interesting because they have a greater than average desire to be educated.... yes, i think that is what it is.

            cora coming to town    just wanted you to be the first to know that cora (originating in quebec) is opening a location in hali.  checking at the  urlLink website  yielded information that it is opening "winter 2003"  great, i know what i'll be doing this summer: trying out everything on the menu to find that delicate balance between hitting the right spot and not getting unpleasantly stuffed (full).  check out my  urlLink restaurant review page  for my experiences with chez cora in montreal!

       (i didn't prepare this post or this picture immediately but rather about half a month ago before i knew exam madness would strike.  i'm posting it now because very recently i sent a "care package" to paul and included one of my famous mp3cd's and thought this would be an appropriate add-on.  :)  )    urlLink    hot asian girls, hehe    i'm not a music reviewer (because i'm not the least bit inclined and my taste kinda sucks - mainstream) but here are my thoughts anyway on 10 cd's that i have recently acquired.   1.  ayumi hamasaki's  "rainbow"  - sometimes japanese music runs the risk of sounding really... tinny and girly (say track 2, "we wish"). on the other hand, i really like tracks 3 ("real me"), 5 ("heart place"), 6 ("over"), 7 ("hanabi"), 11 ("dolls"), 13 ("voyage"), 14 ("close to you")    2.  ayumi hamasaki's  "ayu-mi-x 4 + select non-stop mega mix"  - thought that it would be neat to have a disc of non-stop japanese dance.... how wrong i was. wait, i'll have a second, fuller listen but i didn't like it on the first listen.... "a song for xx" is cool.... ripping a "non-stop" dance album to mp3s has the unfortunate effect of adding "stops". as audio tracks the track boundaries are blurred (mixed) but as separate mp3 files, it's a bit unnaturaly unless you have an mp3/media player with the fading option turned on.    3.  boa's  "valenti"  - this girl was touted as the overnight rnb sensation to japanese music. they were right about the rbn part! actually most of the tracks are good, i think. she artfully manages to avoid any overly bubblegummy japanesesque music. kinda like utada hikaru - man, i want to hear something new from her! tracks 2 ("jewel song"), 8 ("moon &amp; sunrise"), and 12 ("feel the same") are nice. i think there may have been something wrong with the original track 9 ("discovery"). :(    4.  cecilia cheung's  "real me"  - cecilia is  not  a good singer but i think she gets a lot of credit for being really pretty.... i didn't like this album too much because it seems like it takes her a whole lot of effort to sing and that shows through to even unmusical me. that being said, some more decent tracks are track 2 ("stop the game") and 3 ("gamble love").   5.  kelly chan's  "baby cat"  - has a very alluring cover of her in cowgirl dress and lounging in a meadow. track 1 ("baby cat") undoutably did well in hk but i don't like it too much. i think that tracks 3 ('love poison"), 8 ("change love"), 9 ("genial me") better showcase her talent as a ballad-singer.    6.  a-mei cheung's "fever" - a-mei is one of my favourite singers because of her two really great songs: "you didn't want it either" &amp; "sisters." in this album i think she's getting a bit experimental with her sound, like seen in tracks 1 ("fever") and 5 ("54321"). some of her more typical - ballad-fare can be found on tracks 3 ("know"), 7 ("deliberately disturb his heart"), and 10 ("katsu", a japanese track!).    7.  sandy lam's  "2003 new song + best of"  - these are her "best hits" and coming from an established singer they are all indescribably really good! i like the "classic" sound that she has - no screaming. :p like... track 1 ('best thing"), 6 ("hello lonely" is the cover for something i can't think of right now...), 7 ("love someone who won't return"), and 9 ("you are my man" is definitely a cover). actually, she reminds me a whole lot of faye wong (without the freaky turns), am i alone on this one?    8.  yan-zi sun's  "to be continued"  - apparently my blog turns up when people search for yan-zi probably because her name is not often anglicized. but people don't linger on my page long because this  isn't  a page about her. if someone would read more closely, i'll rave about the first track here. "weird" is  so  much fun. not only does she sample east indian music (which is ultra-cool to do these days), but the track develops into a tribalesque song - akin to a-mei's "sisters" and "from the mountain top" and you remember that a-mei hails from an actual taiwanese tribe. while she has some kinda typical ballads, she also is going for a different niche with this folkish "not finished" (track 4) and with "lonely direction, india ending" (track 10). warning: track 11 ("my story, your ending") is about the worst english song i've ever heard from a chinese artist!    9.  sally yeh's  "you heard"  - i heard only one song from her and that was a cover of the "titanic" song and i liked it very much. she's also an older singer -&gt; so more classic sound. i like very much track 1 ("pain passes").   10.  yumiko's  "the debut"  - i kept seeing yumiko posters all over chinatown so i picked up this cd (at $3.33, it's not bad). i don't exactly have it straight  who  yumiko is - the girl on the cover? because there are a couple other girls contributing to the album. i like their pop sound - not trying to be something alterna or anything. the good tracks are tracks 1 ("light divide hot"), 3 ("concentrate on an idea" samples symphony no. 9), 6 ("flower design"), 8 ("opposite humidity"), 9 ("i wanna be" is done by maggie instead of yumiko)

       (change is good: i don't think i ever say something about anyone that they would not be happy about so i'm changing my policy and putting down first names.  i think this will work in constantly making me obliged to be responsible with my blogging as well.)    ENERGY     wow, that was a really rough few days and about the very most i could bear - i've gotten so soft!!  friday and saturday were  study-like-mad  for data mining days.  i kinda wasted my time on studying for that like i wasn't fruitful with the time i had.  could have learned more about clustering - grr, i thought his question was quite unfair and unreasonably too specific.  :(  actually, i was so tired during the night time data mining exam.  was supposed to finish off networking studying that night to have a cleared day for game theory on sunday but... didn't.  so sunday was half about networking and the bulk of it was all about game theory.   all night until like 5 a.m. this morning.   we saw the early-shift come in as we were leaving (kume and tuyet!).  i found myself  racing the sunrise  on my way home to  my comfy unused bed ....  three hours of sleep and i was awake again and not tired a wink.  amazing how i got through the day without caffeine - i usually want one like a crutch during an exam but did fine without (what a gamble!).  didn't have but one tea in the wee hours of the morning when trying to focus for game theory.  that blessed course is  nearly  over.  i must say that despite all that, the past few days were also pleasantly enjoyable.  my girls mona and vinnie were there all night at csb with me and angus.  we went for a mcd's run where the staff know the girls from their midnight runs and maybe that was the secret to my success:  sugar infusion  in the form of a creme egg mcflurry :p  for three days straight, i joined like 80% of the female population in  exam-dress-down  to sneakers and track pants.  what a load of worries that took off and i never knew that.  and i had res food for the first time in years - that was a far more convenient option than starving or even starting up my car to go downtown for fast food.  angus had only about a third of the work i had to do over the weekend (game theory was the big thing) but he was always there maybe just doing this own thing and i think that was essential to me not quitting because i might very well have because no one was looking.  yay!  :)

         sights 'round hali  (click on images for larger image) urlLink    urlLink      far be it for me to chortle with glee about halifax.  most of the time i really think this place sucks as a wannabe big city that never lives up to the hype.  the one thing that will get me most excited for this place is when i take a look into the harbour.  the activity in it speaks for itself.  we have a navy base (and part of me swells up with pride when we cross the bridge and i see the big letters "canada's east coast navy" -- go east coast!), and shipyards, and cargo yards where we get cargo ships from europe, and cruise ships coming in.  and one of the most exciting sights, then is the oil rigs.   oil = $$  so that is especially appealing that dartmouth (and halifax's) very own get to handle the work on them.    urlLink    urlLink   maybe you don't get an idea of the scale of these things.  (or maybe you do.)  when the rowan-gorilla (the third picture) was elevated like you see there, i could see this thing that looked like a ship floating in the sky from my house, 10 kilometers away.  the erik raude (second picture) is the biggest of its kind and stands 80 stories somehow or other.  i remember how last summer i drove along the short trying to get as close as possible to either of the rigs to feel their immenseness.  i don't think i'm the only one to try to do this as there were other cars parked at the coast guards with people taking pictures and standing in awe.   what brings me to all this?  there is one mother of an oil rig in the harbour at the moment and if i don't find a picture like i did for the other two, i'll take one for myself.  by day it is red and vastly huge that you could believe it could hold a big city on it with two large cranes extending up, up....  by night, it is lit like an luminous monster with two bright claws and since it is sitting right in the middle of the harbour and so huge, you'd almost think you could touch it from the shore.  it really makes the harbour look so tiny and that is what i find so awesome of it.   i'm a constant threat to other drivers when i see one of these things in the harbour when i'm driving.   does anyone know what this oil rig is called or where i can get pics by day and / or night??  gotta give credit where it's due: these pictures come from this  urlLink photo album .

        shopping (ahh!) is therapeutic   since it offends my sister to go shopping when she has a lot of homework / studying to do, i've got to resort to what i can do: online shopping!  it's been a while and i know why: it is too darned pleasing.  since i do not have the confidence to buy clothes online (what if they don't look right?) i'm relegated to shopping for non-clothes (like cd's and books) and today, my first "jewelry" purchase.  i recommended to  urlLink my jewel thief  from one of my dailies where i learned i could get ultra-cute personalized bracelets from the comfort of my own home.  (what could beat that??)  here is a verbal description: you get a coloured rubber strap (purple for me of course!) with an adjustable clasp and onto the rubber strap you can slide "charms" - the letters of your name, or other little icons.  so i got a strap, three letters (guess which??) and two icons.  :)  and now eagerly awaiting it's arrival! :)   eating is therapeutic   i get to be such a baby when i'm sick!!  yesterday i wanted so much to have dinner that was comforting goodness so i went to  maki maki  on spring garden road.  i was pleased to learn that their 2-for-1 sushi special for 12.95 or 16.95 is extended from only monday's to tuesday and wednesday as well.  (hmm, that might not be a good thing if they have to extend the special.)  what could be more comforting goodness than a big steaming bowl of soup noodles with some bland (boiled) vegetables and meat?  that is what i ordered: chicken udon noodles in soup (8.95).  and because i was at a maki place (supposedly), i caved in and ordered salmon maki (6 pcs., 4.50), and a green tea (1.50, overpriced!  especially when i wasn't given a whole lot of tea leaves.  i can't remember who told me that a mark of a good restaurant is seeing people eating and enjoying their food alone.  i was at  curry village  where someone noted this while nodding his head towards the second person so far that evening dining alone.  so either maki maki is quite decent or both i and this other guy are pretty hard up for dinner company.  i've never eaten alone at a restaurant before.  it's not so daunting after all.  i only really did it yesterday because i was alone at the time i wanted to eat (and gleefully so, mind you).  but certainly i wouldn't mind going alone to  hamachi house  or something more cafe like  italian gourmet .  maki maki, being run by chinese people (cantonese-speaking no less so i could understand the kitchen chatter all along), gave me a chinese-style chicken udon.  it never pretended or said it would be seriously japanese (like miso or boniyo broth).  the chicken was grilled and i was most pleased that it was a colour dish with sliced shiitake mushroom in a flower-bud shape, shreds of egg, and two broccoli bushes.  since the broth was nothing thrilling (i.e., japanese) i found myself adding the spice laid to my side.  the maki was slightly disappointing - i felt as if it was kind of sloppily made - and you know that i don't particularly enjoy so much the rice and seaweed getting in the way between me and my raw fish!  maki maki is a really small eating counter kind of japanese restaurant (it has about 20 seats).  i would advocate going for the sushi specials where you can get almost as much sushi as you want plus soup and salad for $8.50 a person.  it's sushi  quality  i would say, unfortunately, is somewhat lacking though.   (three point nine / five)

        need for speed   so a quick google-check turns up that "need for speed" is a racing car term.  did everyone know that except for me??  probably....!  :p  and aside from daytona-the-video-game (don't know the names of anything more recent), i don't in the least bit understand advocate the idea of driving a car really fast.  unfortunately the racing world coined this term that came to my mind as i was jogging today.   trying  (being the operative word) to make up for yesterday but alas i am getting a sore throat (and who knows what other thrills to follow in the next couple of days) and after 18 laps (under 30 minutes, 3 miles, with a break in the middle), i let myself slack and called it day.  i could convince myself (and hopefully you) that i was really pushing myself to totally guarantee 3 ten-minute miles and that wiped me out when my lungs are already suffering on their own.  yesterday i was really, really,  really  tired that i did something i've only seen other people do - take a ten-minute nap at my computer (spent all day in a spot editing a report as it came to me in pieces).  it served to refresh me but i'm getting a bit alarmed that i'm prematurely getting old and tired!  little naive me i didn't know that some really intense and desperate students actually take speed when they have exams or other school crunch.  i was shocked with this revelation but suffice it to say that i would never even experiment with that kind of stuff except under one circumstance: in a completely empty locked room where i could come to no harm.  and then i wouldn't be able to study!!   need for a supervisor   i feel severely behind the times.  certain colleagues of mine are either 4 months ahead of me or even 4 months behind me in their coursework part of their master's and have already determined who their supervisor will be.  i really want to be just like them in that they are making tangible progress towards the thesis part of their degree - every week they must make the time to investigate that they are most interested in (dare i say passionate about?) because they have an upcoming meeting with their supervisor.  when i chose my honours supervisor, i selected the "easiest" area in biochemistry (just like software engineering is "easiest" in computer science) and incidentally i found myself in an all-chinese lab.  and now i wonder if it wasn't a really odd lab because although it was small (in size and number of people), it had a weightily disproportionate amount of post-docs versus grad students (3 to 1) and i was the lone honours student.  besides a language barrier (i feel as if the constant buzz of mandarin that i do not understand was far less instructive to me than a constant buzz of english), i hadn't any peers (or near peers in the form of grad students) to confer with.  back then, too, i was very afraid to ask for help (still am but hopefully less so!) especially from the oh-so-knowledgeable post-docs.  so i'm a bit freaked out by the thought of a repeat of such an experience.  further, when kindly people ask me what i'm interested in when i say that i have to pick a supervisor, i cannot answer them.  i can tell you what i  know  these days because of courses that i have taken (networking, algorithms, neural networks to some basic extent, data mining, and what am i going to do with game theory??!!).  i'm not particularly thrilled with anything i've taken all on its own (like networking) but when i think of applying something i know to some area of bioinformatics, that gets me more excited.  like that  urlLink thesis topic  i heard of last week (or two weeks ago).  i don't know if i can ask a prof in, say, data mining for something like that - to ask for an application and hope he / she is also interested.  but whether it is in networking or data mining or ai (eep!  no background in that at all.), i don't know yet, which is  highly odd , i think.  maybe i'm just destined to be odd-ball or maybe i'm going about thinking of this entirely  wrong .  :(   ode to my calves   now for a lighter note.... :)     it shocks me that i have calf muscles larger than those of slender guys or guys with so-called "chicken legs."  so i won't even bother considering that they are two-fold larger than some toothpick girl's calves.  when i want to get a nice pair of knee-high boots they are prohibitive because cookie-cutter boots from aldo just weren't made for girls with wider calves.  (they have some at  urlLink j.crew  without sacrificing elegance, apparently.)  though i haven't heard the same expression in chinese, in japanese, they characterize these calves as "radishes," and i am familiar with the stumpy vegetables they are referring to (they are yummy!).  there is even a cosmetic surgery procedure popular over there where they inject something (botox?) to disable the nerve and then calf muscles atrophize and, voila, thinner calves!  ugh, the thought of that!  part of their size comes from dancing (so i fancy) but my father also has big calves and i think that is where i got them from.  i can only do what i can to lengthen them (like running, and not playing soccer) but at the same time i'm really glad: sometimes i see those women who are (unfortunately) top-heavy and/or hip- and leg-heavy but they have these thin calves and i think it looks out of proportion.  and i have been told that mine are really nice and sexy which convinces me that i just have a severely distorted view of myself and everything is actually a-ok and good-looking.  :)

        hard at work... and yes, working hard!   you know i hate it when people say, "hard at work?  or are you hardly working?"  *wink*wink*jab*jab*  yuppers, that's me, a little bug working hard for a deadline later today.  i'm so mad at me because i forgot to use as motivation my appalling food intake of yesterday as motivation to complete my run today and i stopped at the atrociously low distance of  1 mile .  (i will surely do it tomorrow because that wasn't even an exertion at all!)  i was exceedingly tired and i can feel in my throat that i'm coming down with something - at the very worst time for me to be gotten down by  anything .  further, maybe my heels were giving me problems because i spend a great deal of time walking around yesterday performing a  site survey  of the cs building, measuring the obstacles for wireless network deployment for our networking project.  honestly, i'm a reader, not an experiment-maker because when the factors started to flood on us that we forgot to take into account and we had to add so many tests to determine their validity... oh, my head got so swamped.  and when you're experimenting, that's labour (blood, sweat, and tears) and that is just too much for me when i'm already a jogger and i have to run around when waitressing!

        this is not a diet journal   because if it was, i would have to confess to my daily barrage of junk-food eating.  like....    i woke up really early (daylight saving time and everything) and had  cereal with milk   and since i was on track to be early for my networking meeting, i got my favourite mcdonald's breakfast of  sausage 'n' egg mcmuffin with a hashbrown  and orange juice - it's been a while since my last mcd's breakfast!  on my way to work from school, succumbing to a hunger pang and desire for novelty i picked up a dq (new)  fudgee-o blizzard   i asked for an appetizer that was a curried  egg roll  (yummy, my restaurant has the best egg rolls :) ) containing cabbage and pork  dinner consisted of asparagus, pineapple, red peppers, and beef  stir-fry  on rice  first dessert was a danone  strawberry yogurt   second dessert:  pears and oranges   third dessert:  two dark chocolate truffles  washed down with a  glass of (2%) milk     fortunately that would be the end of my day!  i don't want to think of the number of calories but wait, i don't have to because i'm not a calorie-counter!  consider this to be  exam diet  - which was introduced to me by p a long time ago: when you're all about studying and that is the number one priority, it hardly matters what junk you put in your body (compared to your usual healthy days) as long as you have the energy to continue studying... and then when it's all over you worry about getting back into your healthiest state!

        it's a head thing   went jogging this morning.  remember how on wednesday i was suffering from such aches and pains that i cut my run at 60% (and rued it terribly).  so today - i  had  to do "the usual."  it's a head thing: i told myself i knew what i could inately do (with enough sleep and nutrition) - it's just that i usually get really  bored  and that generally makes me want to give up.  i told myself that i had to look  dazzling  during my networking presentation because i was to wear a sleeveless shirt and, well, whatever jogging does for my arms i had to do all 30 laps to get that benefit (yes, it doesn't do a whole lot for the arms and i refused to take the time to do push-ups on a time-pressed day).  finally, it's a head thing because i took a vitamin before my jog.  i have enough sleep and breakfast a good time before the jog and as if there was any lingering excuse it was smashed because i had all the vitamins i needed to carry through.  it's not a work-out drug so how bad is that??  (at a later date i'll tell you exactly how each component of the multi-vitamin i took seriously did help me with my jog....)   networking  soiree    so i'm writing this from the middle of a networking soiree.  a party.  a "conference."  i never win anything but tonight we were the first group to be drawn to go (yes, that is a good thing) and maybe it was just me  feeling thrilled with the sheer luck of what i wanted coinciding with what i got !  i was getting so frustrated because one of my group members insisted that we practice and practice so much.  well, not more than what i practiced for my data mining presentation that was a bit longer than this presentation and i presented alone.  and i guess it is a more delicate situation to present as a team to ensure we didn't step all over each other in what we presented.  i can't tell if we were stellar or good or anything.  i'm just glad that that blip is over and done with!

        f5 for 2003-04-04   i've deliberately skipped the past two friday five's because they asked me to be a bit more insightful than i actually care to be right now!  so this week's looks like a no-brainer and i might just give my typical one-word answers because i'm not particularly  passionate  about it.      how many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?   counting only the places my parents rented or owned as a family "home," only two so far.  one ratty one in the ratty north-end section of dartmouth and our current one that we've been at for over twenty years!  but i've also lived in res and rented in waterloo, stayed with relatives in toronto and hong kong for lengthy (3+ months) periods of time where i became quite at home as well.   which was your favorite and why?   i suppose my no. 1 favourite no matter how meagre it is is my current home.  it's where i grew up... even though i didn't grow that much!   do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? why?   very stressful.  it's very grimy work and it's not just a day's mess afterwards because you'll be "settling in" for days or weeks and still unpacking.   what's more important, location or price?   location.  i.e., i would pay more for what is currently convenient (like living downtown when i don't have a car, or living on the transit line versus living further out) or for a better neighbourhood.   what features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?   everything!  haha.....

        breathing day   i didn't go to game theory class today because they're only doing presentations and i've been so against the course from the first mention i heard of it (and so  shocked  that i'm still in it) that when attendence is no longer mandatory due to side excursions of "lecture" topics, there's no way i was going to attend!!  so i went jogging today and as the title indicates, it was a "breathing day" and little else.  i started getting sharp pains in my right calf and pain in my left knee so i quit 60% of the way through :(  .  it is so aggravating that i wanted to poke my thumb amongst the muscles in my calf and see if that doesn't make it feel better!  my next challenge is getting to breathing properly because as yet i don't know how much detriment i do to myself for not breathing properly.  likewise when i was doing sit-ups i practiced exhaling during exertion.  that could have been the  first time  i've ever done that.  it doesn't seem intuitive to me and i certainly lost track of how many i had done because i was concentrating on breathing.  :p  i've got a whole lot of schoolwork to do so it's incredible that i haven't given up yet on the schedule....  friday will be better than today!

         casual day     upon p.'s suggestion from a long time ago, i'm going to take a "casual" day once a week.  you know, a day to step down from my 3" (or higher) shoes and kick around in flats (or sneakers).  and then my back hurts :( from some extreme stretching i did yesterday (note to self: stretch out before stretching :p ) so casual days start today and i'm short and sporty today!  when my sister saw how short i'd be today, she wondered if we could hang out and study together today because she looks like a giant by comparison!  yesterday i saw m. and v. kicking around in jogging suits (how cute it was they matched!) and wondered if they had gone jogging.  but no, it was stress speaking out and they were dressing down to cope.  so, in preparation to follow p.'s suggestion a few weeks (maybe a month ago) i went to  urlLink sportchek  to satiate my curiosity:  can i fit i fit into kids' size?   and i found that i could!  pants are the right length for starters but i'm not a medium youth or anything -  large .  and the bonus is that youth clothing comes cheaper than women's clothing that costs an arm and a leg.  for example, athletic pants (i refuse to wear terry cloth or sweats material) cannot be got for less than $40 for women.  for kids: $30.  check out the dream girl  pants i got from sportchek in navy blue for sale: $25.  you know what?  my  legs  hurt from this  weird  phenomenon that is being short and low to the ground!  :p  but then the thought of crossing campus isn't quite so disheartening with sneakers that add spring to your step so when dl invited me, i went to dalplex to watch him play in the badminton tournament (he won his game :) ) and then very quickly managed to return to studying.   ode to joy   sk and then p called me last night only around one o'clock a.m. and i was already out like a light.  i can't remember what i said on the phone or the name of the s.e.s. song p recommended and i said i would download!  i'm so freaky tired - stress, i tell you.  despite everything i have to do, i hardly stay up really late to do work.  no, i'm not  that  productive during the day either.  i don't know how things actually do get done but they do....  :)

         urlLink f5  for 2003-05-30       what do you most want to be remembered for?   for my person - as someone likeable and respectable and fascinating and fun.  :)   what quotation best fits your outlook on life?    "the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."   if you don't know why that applies to me, you don't know me.   what single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   getting a combined honours degree in may 2002 and poised to do a master's in a completely different field without wasting further time.   what about the past ten years?   since high school in general wasn't exactly the high point of my life so the greatest day was the end of it all - high school graduation.  years of hard work finally paid off in winning more than my fair share of prizes.  i don't think i was ever as hard-working, diverse, well-rounded, and open-minded as i was back then.  as a testiment, i won awards/recognition in: leading intramural activities, school "letters" for contribution and academics, the english prize for highest grade, the math prize for highest grade, the governor general prize for highest average in the graduating class, the ut book award (some one-per-school award for well-roundedness), and maybe the language prize but i forget now!   if you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   listen to your parents - they love you more than you understand as yet and only want the best for you!

        eyeglasses & intelligence & "white hair"   i have a weird desire: i want to have the "intelligent" look of people who wear glasses.  normally i see myself as tart-looking.  sometimes i even dress the part (however more and more often i'm not).  and what better confusing contrast to dressing vampy and then putting on a pair of glasses and getting hard at work?  i have a sick fascination with these kind of contrasts.  it's not like i want my vision to go - oh no - in fact, k is the poor recipient of my very insensitive questions like: "so, what did you feel like while you were losing your normal vision?"  it's just that when i was in boston i should have picked up the glasses at the street kiosk with the clear lenses two years ago and now i'd be able to satiate this desire.  instead i feel confined to perpetual vampiness....  well, if i can't feel mature and sedate from sporting eyewear, here is a consolation (??): while parting my hair this morning i realized that i have a new short hair that is white!!  this is so shocking because i thought that the consolation for being really short was going to be having a head of only black hair until i'm into my mid-thirties.  ai me.  i'm feeling  really old  today!  (there is a  remote  possibility it is a severely bleached hair but it's so shiny silver!)  this discovery today necessitates dying my hair so people won't see that i'm graying!

         omigosh i'm plugging for a toothbrush     that is how pathetic my life has become.  massaging my gums is the utmost comfort i get.  blech.  but it is sooo truly blissful to have your gums gently massaged by the soft rubber bristles.  (i own a purple colgate massager.  :D )  as a general rule i dread my daily night-time dental hygiene routine.  it takes all sorts of will power to not skip it and "make up" for it in the morning.  so any excitement to make me look forward to the ordeal is helpful.  i used to do plies (where is my accent ague?) while i brushed my teeth... yeah, back in the day when i had buns of steel.  hehe.  i just ended up working a lot at the restaurant this weekend.  lots and lots and lots.  yes, that is good and obedient little me.  &lt;~halo~&gt;  i worked friday night.  then had a group meeting bright and early saturday morning followed by wrangling with intelligent systems homework (it was actually pretty easy but my brain is feeling somewhat rusty).  in the afternoon i went jogging with the cs (outdoor) jogging group.  we went for no more than half and hour but it was a most gruelling activity i had to do (since yogaflex).  i'm just not an outdoor jogger (yet) - i need my  .  :p  my sore feet were further exacerbated by having to run around like mad at work - always a good thing.  dance practice this morning (things really  gelling  :) ) where the sweat part of  blood, sweat, and tears  was definitely shed.  i get to wear the nicest ao dai that i've had the pleasure of wearing for the multicultural dance (yay :) ).  and more work this evening.  here is the formula:   rainy weather + no back-up help + a yummy and steaming cup of tea + wyn's desire to sink into a mindless novel     = work doesn't let up and wyn's tea grows cold and novel goes unread   good!

         urlLink f5  for 2003-05-23      what brand of toothpaste do you use?   colgate or crest.  other brands seem so... non-standard.  we buy all-in-one's (tartar and plaque control, cavity fighting) and i like some whitening element in there too.   what brand of toilet paper do you prefer?   i don't shop for it but as long is it is soft to the touch....   what brand(s) of shoes do you wear?   weird question....   urlLink transit shoes  are affordable and they have deals like "get the 2nd one for half price."   urlLink aldo shoes  are better quality but not necessarily more comfortable (but it could just be the style i buy).  for sneakers i'm a nike or adidas girl.  :)   what brand of soda do you drink?   i don't drink soda.   what brand of gum do you chew?   dentyne ice.  i don't like how you don't get wrappers but it's got a hard shell so it's not like extra or trident that melts in the summer.  i refrigerate gum (that i buy in mass quantities) until i eat it.  :)     fanquevallemud   i wouldn't usually post a forward i got but it's so cute!  Use some imagination to look at this message. It's really funny. This is to test your English speaking level.... Try reading it aloud: "Fanquevallemud".  Its amazing, you will understand the above word by the end of the conversation......  Read aloud for best results.  The following is a telephone exchange between a hotel guest and room-service at a hotel in Asia..   Room Service (RS): "Moling! loom sirfesee" Guest (G): "Yes......" RS: "Dju witch true odor somefing??" G: "Uh..yes..I'd like some bacon and eggs" RS: "How July it done peace?" G: "What??" RS : "How July it done?... Fi, boy?" G: "Oh, the eggs! How do I like them? Sorry, scrambled please." RS: "Howbow bkan?" G: "Crisp will be fine." RS: "O light. An some DOS?" G: "What?" RS: "Dosee. July some DOS?" G: "I feel really bad about this, but I don't know what 'Door-C' means." RS: "Mmm...............Toes! toes!... G: "O, you mean Toasts!....No, do you have something else?" RS: "Howbow ink-ga-nutsu mudfun?" G: "English muffin!! I've got it! Yes, an English muffin will be fine." RS: "Copy?" G: "Sorry?" RS: "Copy...Mill...all T?" G: "Yes. Coffee please, and that's all."

         "i visited a whorehouse... and liked it!"      urlLink neptune theatre  always delivers.  yesterday night i went to see  the best little whorehouse in texas , a musical that wraps up neptune's 39 th  season.  they brought in  urlLink gary sandy  to play sherriff ed earl and other neptune regulars played the unforgettable characters of miss mona (karen edissi), dawn (catherine braund), angel (raquel duffy), doatsy mae (jill harland), governor (frank mackay), and shy (jen macdowell).  it was simply a fantastic show.  musicals are really fun to watch live because a hilarious one is more interactive than a play.  surely the play was constantly shocking in both song and speech.  it was fabulous.  the actors were positively convincing in character and they transported you effectively to 1970's texas.  close your eyes and the bluesy and country tunes would lead you to think you're in a bar in nashville hearing this story unfold.  it was riotous at times when the sherriff swore - here, we make comparisons of foul language to sailors' language but perhaps in texas such language is likened to sherriffs?  and to offset feminine nudity in  les liasons dangereauses  we got an eyeful of jocks in a locker room scene!  as usual, the set created by neptune was really stunning.  i wish i could take a picture with my camera.  the bordello was the main backdrop where the lack of velvet was compensated with rich red hues on the walls.  the actual small rooms on the second level were each equipped ceiling fans and cranky blinds the operation of which would seriously hinder a couple in passion.  :p  a main spiralling staircase was reused while new scenes were dropped in front of the bordello background to create a legislative building, coffee shop, sherriff's office, and locker room.  while the sumptuous costumes were the eye candy of  les liasons , i think the complete set was this time!  next year neptune celebrates its 40 th  season making it the second oldest regional theater in canada (yay!).  on the playbill (which is available from their site) are "big names" such as "the rocky picture horror show," "death of a salesman," and their final show will be "cats"!  i am very grateful to my  urlLink high school  for introducing me to the theater.  (we used to go about four times a year.)  otherwise, i'm not so sure i'd be so matter-of-fact about  going to the theater .   pre-show   tried out a  yogaflex  class.  it followed my most gruelling run, which was incidentally my first run in ages - half an hour!  (i remember, once upon a time, attending a yogatrim class at the y in north york after a 40+-hour week on a friday afternoon.  they extinguished the lights and let the room be lit by the natural winter sunlight coming through a skylight.  i was lying on my back from some exercise and dozed off like a baby....)  flexibility is something that i've always prided myself in (you know, ballet background and stuff) so the idea of an hour-long class to stretch and increase "core strength" sounded nice after a  gruelling run .  what i didn't bargain for was being unable to perform some of the exercises from lack of experience.  i was like, "quadricep stretch?  pff, bring it on!"  and she did and i tipped over because i'm actually pretty shaky when it comes to these yoga / pilates exercises.  :(  oh well,  nothing like a challenge to keep up one's interest .  we went to eat at  urlLink tomasino's  for a quick dinner.  read the review in the comments of the blog i first visited tomasino's.

        girl time   i'm telling you practices for the multicultural dance are really great.  i had a different childhood.  i don't suppose i was never allowed to have friends or anything but i was certainly forbidden to do what seemed at the time to be the most normal thing in the world:  sleepovers .  (to my parents i was a  princess  and princesses don't just do any ordinary thing like sleep at someone else's house on borrowed favours.)  i knew that me going out in order to get to know people at my new school was so discouraged (in light of having to work really hard to continue attaining academic success), i turned down offers without passing them through my mother.  and then the offers stopped coming.  socializing with people for me is like some kind of meeting all of the time.  i barely understand the meaning of  hanging out and doing absolutely nothing  with friends because i'm not the kind of friend that is so exclusive that you see me every day.  so every encounter with a friend has to be maximized, you know?  trade the most information as possible because time is always limited.  so when i'm at a practice and it is winding down and i don't have anything pressing to depart for, i hang out.  the girls might be a bit (or a lot) younger than i am, but their world is so very different from mine or anything i've ever experienced....  sometime in my early twenties i became aware and celebrated being a  woman .  despite that, i didn't celebrate being a  girl  until more recently.  it's weird.  i wear stuff that people save for when they are going out downtown or to a "nice" restaurant on a daily basis.  upon seeing me every morning my sister would say, "what are you so dressed up for?" more as a rhetorical question than an actual one.  oddly enough i wasn't girly.  dressing "well" was practically automatic for me and i didn't mess with my hair (except to dye it) or with my make-up.  that was way too much hassle (and still is).  some of my no-nonsense attitude about personal grooming is "guy"-like and god knows where it comes from.  (i have an idea about it....)  wyn of three or four years ago wouldn't believe the wyn that just turned 25.  in some ways i lament trading in doing things on my own for bands of girls but i also find myself learning very important skills that just aren't needed so much with guy friends, like listening!  and empathy, even though that goes against my grain.  more recently i've also learned from a girl who has had to put her best face forward more often than i have the best of all sorts of make-up products.  (who has the time to figure it out for yourself?  i'm so glad she told us!)  if i don't get this down and out here, i'll never remember this girly stuff!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powder -  urlLink estee lauder  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mascara -  urlLink lancome  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lipstick -  urlLink shiseido  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye-shadow -  urlLink mac  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lotion -  urlLink clinique   and i think there is more learning to come....!

         the matrix  urlLink    urlLink      saw  the matrix: reloaded  on thursday night (second show) en masse with about twenty vietnamese people.  :p  i won't bother babbling about it because i think  urlLink this review  does a perfectly good job at doing it.  i won't remember most of it soon but i'll certainly remember what gave it the r-rating: massive and very entrancing dance to jungle beats in an underground cave converted to place of worship!  otherwise, i've signed on to watching so many more movies this summer it is insane.  you couldn't tie me down to watching a rented movie but i  guess  i can muster the energy to make myself look nice and go out and watch a movie.  on a growing list of movies to watch: finding nemo, charlie's angels: full throttle, t3 (with singer), legally blonde 2 (with my sister), and better luck tomorrow (a chinese flick, with andrew).  i'm also watching "the best little whorehouse in texas" at  urlLink neptune  on tuesday but not spoilers until then.  :p

        (fluffy)  urlLink f5  for 2003-05-16  this friday5 is sooo fluffy but i thought the answers would be interesting....  but then, maybe not.   you're just gonna get an earful of my neurotic fluff.  :p     What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?   my mum laments this but i love the tap water from my bathroom sink the very best.  it is most likely laden with all sorts of crap but it is the most pure and refreshing to me, oddly enough.  k and i surmised that it sits particularly well with us because we use it everyday to brush our teeth from the time we were tots!   What are your favourite flavor of chips?   oh, this is bringing on a salt craving.  :p  ketchup (except it leaves a tell-tale stain on your fingers that you have been eating chips), salt and vinegar, and pringles pizza flavour.  :p   Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?   huh, it is a  very  limiting question when you confine it to the dishes  i  can cook.  and unimaginatively i would have to answer is pasta....  that is, if i can still cook that.   How do you have your eggs?   mmm, eggs.... (hey, i'm doing this before breakfast!)  i love them poached or sunny-side.  but then i nearly got disgusted last time i had poached eggs and my sister was whispering in my ear (she hates runny yolk) "mmm, runny, cholesterol-laden yolk...."  i do enjoy it but it is an odd thing to like.   Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?   fortunately i can answer this with something yummy!  last night my father made salmon and tofu in black bean sauce which we ate with steamed rice.  tofu and black bean sauce itself was heaven for me.  the salmon was quickly fried in oil ("bao" whatever that translates to in english) and maybe some ginger would have taken away the fishy smell that stuck with it (unfortunately).  when i saw the orange slabs of raw salmon, did i drool for it for salmon sashimi....?  :p

        update stuff   so.... the  urlLink school schedule  has been finalized.  i'm taking  advanced web programming  that i have been so excited to take for over four months now and the prof is really nice and calls me "winnie" (i think i instructed him to do so).  and - of all the surprises - i'm also taking  intelligent systems  which sounds a lot like a survey artificial intelligence course like the one i started taking the fall but dropped (due to graduate restrictions and total fear of bombing the course).  i tried out  parallel computing  for a day because i know some interesting projects involve collaboration between the parallel computing professor and the biochemistry department but... you can't have it all right?  and i don't want to suffer as i will indeed suffer if i take parallel computing.  funny and unexpected the decisions that i have made and  i've charted an ai path.  aye me.   who woulda thought that??  the nifty part is that through discussions with the roger lab (biochem), i will start by extending the work of this graduating master's student in the form of an in-course project, namely something along the lines of determining the quality of a multiple alignment using ai methods. the master's student used several techniques (bayesian network, support vector machine, decision trees, to name a few) and i'll implement a neural network or use genetic programming or something.  it's not exactly the state i really wanted to be in, that is, i wanted to have a definite supervisor and stacks of papers to read to hone in on my most passionate interest, but it's a start and that's important!  otherwise, life is fun (dance practices and going to see blockbuster summer movies and myriads more activities as the summer gets on) and inactive (haven't been to dalplex in  ages ).  actually, for the past two weeks i have been suffering from a small injury to my knee (as if hyperextending it for so many years finally caught up with me and/or dancing in killer shoes) which lead to favouring the other leg which started to hurt as well.  :(  i'm really angry at myself for voluntarily halving my jogging from 30 laps and then halving that as well and then there wasn't a point in going any more.  just a month short of being a runner for a year!  so a new strategy (possibly a blend of aerobics and running and strengthening) is definitely in order.  tell you how it goes!

        "oh that looks interesting...."   i could lose absolutely all interest in watching television (not having cable and hence having only three channels to watch could help things) were it not for my sister who does find things to watch on our measly selection.  i can't remember a show that i started watching on my own (oh, "felicity" and the star trek franchise :p ) in the recent past but she's influenced me on most others in my current television-watching repetoire.  couldn't stop watching:    alias  gilmore girls  friends  will & grace  sex & the city    sorta neutral about them but wouldn't know them if she didn't watch them:    charmed  boston public  seventh heaven    hate myself for watching:    american idol  survivor  the bold and the beautiful  general hospital

        i LOO-OOVE mother's day!   funny: a few days ago i checked my site stats and learned that someone had arrived at this blog because they googled (or used some other search engine) "i hate mother's day."  that, incidentally, was my mother's day entry title last year because, grr, it's not the least bit relaxing day for my family!  last year, i had a lot of angst against this contrived and very  hallmark  occasion.  why do we have to crowd all our affection and appreciation for our mothers for one day of the year and not spread it out and show it quietly every day of the year instead?  it is simultaneously a boon and a headache for business.  my father was preparing for weeks in advance to make sure we didn't run out of food on this crazy occasion.  from a business point of view, we provide more pleasant and efficient service and still reap the revenues if the business came more steadily rather than all at once.  and then, over the course of this year - i don't know - i gained an enormous amount of gratitude and affection for my parents and at a tighter time than ever before (we were short-staffed by one or two people), we all cheerfully took on our roles.  my father cooked - god knows -  hundreds  of entrees as did the other chef (named ping).  mum kept everyone in order and operated the fryers and grill.  k was a  lean, mean, take-out order packing machine .  and i... had the cleanest job of all taking the non-stop phone calls and greeting people when they arrived and took their money.  :)  the most beautiful part of the evening (and i marvel every mother's day, father's day, valentine's day, new year's eve, and christmas eve), is the amount of food we shove out in that short time span.  everything is made-to-order so as long as there is a food order there is activity and bustle in the kitchen.  all those raw ingredients tossed together so prettily and carefully packaged and sent along with their merry buyers.  it's music to the ears and poetry in motion - yes, i am a  w eird and  w arped girl.  :p

        f5 for the neat-freaks      would you consider yourself an organized person? why or why not?   yes.  sometimes you might look around my room and beg very strongly to differ but that is because i'm lazy as well.  what a contradiction!   do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?   a wall calendar that i don't use so very often (that's why it's a picture-a-day sort from  urlLink lonely planet  so at the very least i can learn about 12 world-wide places a year).  i use my agenda extensively.  :)   would you say that your desk is organized right now?   no!  putting a whole lot of effort into being organized at the present time seems a bit futile because we will be moving.   do you alphabetize cds, books, and dvds, or does it not matter?   not the books because there aren't that many.  textbooks (of which i have  plenty !) are organized by discipline and related disciplines.  and cds are in chronological order of release date after alphabetizing by artist name!   what's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?   probably my mp3s!  you know how we all have gigabytes of mp3s and how on earth do you organize it all so you can rapidly find the mp3s you want to listen to later??  for english music, my file-naming system shows the music genre and either an artist name or album name and the track title.  for chinese music, i have a code for each artist, an album code, track number, and then track name.  anyone who knows me knows that i'm an  absolute stickler  for giving id3 tag information for mp3s!       dio mio's   went to dio mio's on brenton street downtown (off the infamous spring garden road).  a little while ago i read about how the owner(s) wanted to provide more  veggie burger  options to vegetarians in the city.  i mean, before, a vegetarian's selection was kind of limited to mcdonald's, harvey's, and other small joints offering frozen grain burgers or soy patties.  at dio mio's they wanted to invent their own house brand of burgers and being the novelty-seeker and pseudo-health-conscious person that i am, i wanted to try 'em out.  i was greeted with the following selection of burgers (each $4.75):    hazelnut with mango chutney (not available)  mushroom with cilantro mayo  lentil walnut with avocado spread (not available)  indonesian burger (peanut, alfalfa sprouts, tofu) with papaya chutney    .... which on first glance didn't even sound like "burgers" at all.  :p  since i can't stand cilantro i ordered the only other choice i had - indonesian burger.  (next time i may ask for mushroom burger without the mayo.) and it was a grainier burger than i am used to.  it was crumbly but i guess that is what grain burger-eaters are used to and so fragrant becase of the nuts.  i love tofu and i couldn't taste it but it also tasted just fine.  i'm not totally thrilled, i guess, but it was certainly satisfactory.  and of course, a trip to dio mio's wouldn't be complete with a scoop (1.96) or two (3.09) or more (3.99) of "ice cream."  in fact, they offer gelato (italian ice cream, made with less cream and no eggs), sorbetto (italian fruit ice, contains no fat or dairy), and soya magic (made wtih soya milk instead of milk or cream and sweetened with honey).  so i ordered safer (compared to rosemary, basil, ginger, etc.) flavours like a scoop of strawberry sorbetto (no fat!) and a scoop of chocolate gelato.  :)  mmm....  dio mio is a great place to eat lunch or pick up a snack and especially if your alone.  besides what i ordered they have wraps, soup (i'm sure), salad, and other desserts.  tucked away practically underground and not directly on spring garden road, i like how it's not so trendy: you're not eating and staring out at the people on the street and neither are people walking by looking in on you.  the atmosphere is kinda artsy (hey, it's halifax) with a mainly new hippie (for lack of a better description) clientele.  besides the smooth jazzy music here's another enticement for solo diners: an ample assortment of mindless reading in the form of magazines the the coast (a halifax weekly) to wile away your alone-time.  :)  address: 5986 brenton street  ***** click  urlLink here  for a purchase on oct. 20, 2003 click  urlLink here  for their specials as noted nov. 4, 2003 click  urlLink here  for tartufo night description, nov. 18, 2003

        choreography is hard to do!   so, last night we were preparing for the traditional vietnamese dance we will be performing for the annual multicultural festival (june 21-23 or so).  this year we will be performing to a song named  em di xem hoi trang trong  by nguyen ngan (may have mispelled it!).  it was fun.  it was surprisingly harder work than i would have expected.  thuy was unfailingly patient when it came to viewing and re-viewing the video to catch every detail so that we can choreograph our dance.  i don't know if can be part of the planning... so many calls to make and worries - just learning the steps and perfecting them is enough to do!    after practice, we rolled into  fong shing  as they were closing (at 11:30).  funnily, it's a chinese restaurant but i've only ever been there for pho (vietnamese soup noodle) which can be got for $5.50.  salad rolls (2) for 1.60 and vietnamese hot & sour soup for 3.75.  (you don't understand perhaps how i was craving salad rolls - aka vietnamese spring rolls - yesterday because of the really balmy weather!)  it's great pho - which could explain why my vietnamese friends seem to only choose that of all places for weekend pho.  they prepare it with slices of chicken and beef and diced chinese meat balls.  the pho noodles are cooked with white onions and green onions and coriander are sprinkled in.  (i hate coriander so next time i will have to ask them to prepare my meal with no onions at all.)  their spring rolls are fat and filled with vegetables (coriander?), cooked rice noodles, and barbecued pork.   (four point five / five) - for vietnamese fare   *** click  urlLink here  to see another review of fongshing from september 5, 2003 ***   belated birthday   i was so pleased and positively ecstatic when i got home yesterday afternoon to have received a package (gee, my birthday was nearly two months ago :p ) from paul. :) :) :)  he sent me the first season of  buffy the vampire slayer  on dvd which i recall catching parts of but there are certainly holes in it.  like all shows i end up watching, i missed the pilot episode and it's going to be some fun watching! :)  thank you..... :)

        driver's ed    on yesterday's fine sunday afternoon my father, mother, sister, and i drove to the (hopefully) vacant parking lot of micmac mall with the goal of leaving with one or both of me and my sister capable of driving a car that operates with manual transmission.  ~~ boy was that fun !! :) ~~  k had all the theory down of changing of gears down and it was freaky when after i caught on to the subtle movements, that i completely lost it and violently shook my poor family and my father's new baby (his new car) not once nor twice nor three times... maybe four or five times! :p  when i sat again as a passenger when my sister was having her turn for a "practical session" - only then did all the "theory" that my father told me before i started driving start to make sense - at the time he was chattering away i was way too excited to listen... to be driving a completely different kind of car!  when i was goofing up big-time i was too frazzled to listen to my senses for sounds and feelings for the vibrations and stuff.  only as a wiser and calmer person (in the backseat again) could i appreciate the cues for when you are in the wrong (too high or too low) gear.  k did alright.  i correctly suspected that she's a much more adept student than i am when it comes to acquiring motor skills.  i'm the one who could never learn how to ride a bicycle!  :p  driving stick doesn't seem quite so difficult as riding a bike (to me) - at least i've gotten further in learning when it comes to driving a standard!  there were several other cars driving in circles at the same parking lot making for a scary lesson - apparently nice and sunny sunday afternoons are perfect set-ups for driving lessons in deserted parking lots.  :)  then the whole fam we went to eat at  urlLink cora's  for a truly yummy breakfast-meal.  :)   high fidelity   (warning to reader & self: i am not a movie-reviewer.)  that being said, we picked up the 2000 movie named  urlLink "high fidelity"  starring john cusack (what a cutie) from blockbuster because we scoured the comedy aisles and nothing else seemed inspiring.  the name of the movie was familiar to both of us for unidentifiable reasons (unless we were confusing it with the thriller "high frequency").  anyhow, it was a really  fun  movie.  a guy movie.  a music movie.  and, at the end, a romantic movie.  guys are really insane when it comes to love (not news to me!) and it was awfully funny to see it all acted out in such a tortured fashion.  (spoiler coming up:)  there was something really satisfying about how he chose the one he is most comfortable with in the end - not the fantasy.  something kind of rings true of getting tired when you're older and you've been through everything and going with the quiet love over fireworks and pizzaz and  lingerie .  hehe.

        all aboard....!  the "orient express"   whew.  we had our first dragonboat racing practice this evening and i'm very pleased that the practice was superbly organized and we weren't kept there for longer than necessary.  this year i will be paddling with the  chinese society of nova scotia .  i had completely forgotten from three years ago how wet the activity is and how nice it is to be out on the water.  lake banook is vast enough for me (to be  in  it) but with a paddle in hand, you're not out of control!  we are the  "orient express"  team and look for me on saturday july 12 on lake banook - paddler  no. 8  on the left!  :)   full circle   or something like it.  i received very pleasing word from paul today that, well, we can talk again.  over a year ago, i  urlLink wrote (may 13/02)  that we could no longer keep up the daily email correspondences in a (retrospectively sappy) post in my very nascent blog at the time.  :p  and it was through keeping paul up-to-date that spawned the nature and content of this  blog.  i'm tempted to shut this down because it is no longer "necessary" but that would be the end of something that has become a compulsive habit of mine over the course of ayear.  if i do say so myself, i've even developed a semblance of style that takes  time  to hone.  you'll find me trying to remember (but i've always been particularly lousy when quoting people) witty lines to write here.  blogging has simply become a way of life!

        taste-test girl   haha, went out last night on one of the very rare occasions that my sister went as well (the last time would have been last october).  she was taking her friend out for her friend's birthday and i decided to tag along... maybe i wouldn't have to drive as much....?  a neat thing (okay, maybe not so neat) about this arrangement is that one of us can drink so when mona and i slid into the booths at  cheers , it was a novel (rare) occasion to order something alcoholic and get a neat bottle -- i ordered  rev .  couldn't pinpoint what the god-awful taste was during the evening but later i could identify it has drinking liquified marashino cherries and that was wholly, wholly unpleasant.  :(  i started drinking it at 11 and finished at 1 so anyone thinks i shouldn't have driven at 2, raise their hand....?  another hypocritical thing i did was end up at  the dome .  i hate that place with a passion but each of mona and i wandered into the drunken dome-area once for five minutes.  all other times we hung out at cheers with the other old fogies (ironically, she's the same age as my sister and her friend - they hung out at  the attic  to see joel plaskett play) and i was surprised that it was actually less noisy and comfortably less trendy-wannabe than, say, the  bitter end  or the  economy shoe shop .  i must be getting  really  old....  :p  i didn't like drinking (someone's gonna call me a drinker now, huh?) because i felt so exposed.  i don't like drinking because i get really tired and i don't like drinking because my ears burn up and get itchy and expanses of my arms and legs burn up and get itchy.  that's why i'd like to taste-test.  i'm happier off tasting from one or two drinks a night - mixed drinks, wines, cocktails, and the very occasional beer - rather than having to consume an entire serving of liquor for myself.   i'm going to vancouver!!   yes, sirree.  i hate the booking system.  i was all ready to book  well-priced  tickets at $720 (taxes in) a few days ago but mum delayed us from booking because she wanted to explore another alternative: redeem $300 from a travel rewards program but you have to book through them.  and the travel agent was like, "sure, redeem your $300," but she only found plane tickets for $2,000.  what a discouragement to really faithful points-collectors!  :(  so back to  urlLink flytango.com  and i was overwhelmingly disappointed to find that the flights i had pegged were still around but not for as cheap - we had to book for just under $900 instead.  :(   anyways  this girl hasn't been further west than toronto in (i think) fourteen years....!  i'm so happieee to be getting out even for just an extended weekend!  :)     final note on indian food   then i've got to give it (and eating it) a rest....  yesterday i dug up a coupon - 15% off at  urlLink curry village  and k and i were like, "why not?"  it's cheaper to begin with.  i ordered samosas (2 pieces, 4.95), palao (2.95), and chicken korma (9.95).  the owner served us and gave me 15% off (because of the coupon) and returned the coupon to me should i want to use it again (it expires in a day anyways but you  never know ).  he "knows" me and that's both a scary and neat feeling.  at taj mahal they are "too big" (but really aren't) to know their customers but when i've ordered practically the same thing a few times (just change the curry), he remembers me.  :)  compare and contrast: for practically the same items my tab at curry village came to $22 while it came to $29 at taj mahal.  the samosas were not as greasy and the palao was better (personal preference to not have cumin overpowering the rice).  there were about three times more chicken in the dish, too, at curry village....  which is why there is a "fave" label next to one of the restaurants in my  urlLink reviews  page and not next to the other....

          satisfaction feast   it's summer and i've got relatively more time and i have a list about as long as my arm of places i have not yet been to and satisfaction feast would be one of those places.  located on grafton street in downtown halifax, i must say i've never noticed it.  i've driven down grafton street so many times at night looking (and looking) for a parking spot....  it is located to a hip and classy bar called  seven  and needless to say i was a little crestfallen when we walked passed the swanky bar and ended up in the restaurant with the wooden decor.  seven also had people on its itsy bitty patio while satisfaction feast was empty.  (no worries, we were surrounded by healthy eaters midway through our meal.)  we were greeted by a blonde girl wearing a purple sari....  i hope it's not too uncultured for me to say that it was just weird.  not because she's blond because a brunette arrived and she donned a sari in an uncomfortable manner as well.  no matter.  content is what is key.  the atmosphere is woody and very casual.  the piped out some subtle new age like music and i could swear hearing some water running through the background.  deciding what to eat was quite difficult.  amongst our choices were "tofuburgers" (their peaceburger with a tofu-lentil-rice patty or a soyburger), regular kind of no-meat vegetarian dishes (like vegetarian lasagna or pasta or curry), and funkier items where you have non-meat substitutes where you would normally find meat.  like in the neatloaf that sam ordered (8.95).  i ordered a roasted marinated vegetables dish (9.95).  they also have a small juice bar and serve, you know, drinks laced with amino acids and/or ginseng and/or st. john's wort.  everything on their menu contained no meat and all the dishes were marked (or not) whether it was regular vegetarian (no marking), vegan (v), vegan option (vo, whatever that might mean), and gluten-free.  the neatloaf ... i can't remember exactly what was in it.  rice, tofu, onions... in a meatloaf-looking loaf.  it was served with a size of mushroom gravy and two crystalline (they honestly sparkled!) scoops of mashed potatoes.  i wouldn't have minded that dish.  mine consisted of a roasted and marinated assortment of squash, carrots, peppers, celery (maybe) served over gooey wild rice and topped with rice cheese (my other choice was feta that i feared would be too salty).  first off, it didn't  look  appetizing - but i'm also not used to marinated vegetables.  secondly, the cheese was a bit too funky for my narrow taste in cheese.  so the whole dish was a bit difficult for me to get through....  what can i say?  the options are really great.  i think it would be a vegetarian's dream to find a place with a menu where you don't have to worry that meat will enter your food.  otherwise i feel so uncultured to not rave about the place.  :p  i would like to try some of their cheesecake - chocolate will fix anything... right??  address: 1581 grafton street hours: open at 11 a.m. everyday, dinner everyday except for wednesday  boy was it really nice to have even the small amounts of meat in michelina's microwave lasagna (i ate no more than one-third of my lunch).  in the evening we met up with andrew, heather, and josh who (no surprise - it was a gorgeous day) were bent on spending their evening on a  rooftop patio .  i was excited to go to  mexicali rosa's  but alas theirs is not yet finished so we went to  urlLink your father's mustache .  that was not altogether unfavourablewith me because thursday is infamous wing night and haligonians are incomprehensibly keen about al fresco dining.  the patio was in a state of chaos.  all the tables were filled and you could stalk people who had received their bills and had the appearance of being ready to leave or you could be a little more polite, let someone else stalk the diners, and never get a table because there was no idea whatsoever of priority.  we found a table tucked in the corner and the rest was the usual yfm-experience: fun, see-and-be-seen, friendly, yummy!  i realized that finding a place in halifax with patio dining is not the least bit difficult.  i think that each place with patio dining (and some instances of said patios are very measly) is within a stone's throw of the next one and so you can chain halifax together that way.  even the least expected places have it: a japanese restaurant, restaurants tucked inside a power plant, and even places with only the space for five tables.  this is indeed one strange town desperately deprived of sunshine!   film festo al fresco    speaking of al fresco, i realized that we are deep into summer because  urlLink film festo al fresco  is starting on monday and you know the four weeks and four movies will blast by.  this year's offerings: princess bride (july 30), pink panther (july 11), the wizard of oz (july 18), american grafitti (july 25), and finally, the people's choice night on august 1st (choice of annie, cabaret, fiddler on the roof, jesus christ superstar, and my fair lady.... vote for anything but my fair lady * !!).   *  audrey hepburn is fantastic in this movie but i've seen it about ten times....  :)

        i was robbed... :(   it happens every year after multicultural festival where i refrain from having to choose a curry dish from the hindi, indo-canadian, southern indian, sri lankan, and sikh booth (too many choices!) and end up having a really big craving for indian food....  mmm....  the opportunity presented itself to me when i was really restless after jogging yesterday and k was willing to help me out if i got some take-out.  i've said before i'm not thrilled with  urlLink taj mahal  decor or service in general but there wasn't anything wrong to me with going there for take-out (because i really like doing that from curry village).  my strategy was to get  thai chin , actually, but if for some reason i couldn't get hakka chinese food, the take-out counter for taj mahal was one and the same with the thai chin one.  was i disappointed or what when i asked what was in hakka chowmein with manchurian  chicken (specifically what makes hakka chowmein hakka?), she told me the restaurant for that cuisine has not yet been built.  then it is really false advertising to put it on the menu!!  and really evil of the managers to tantalize you with the promise of it and not deliver when it has been over three months since "thai chin -- authentic thai and hakka chinese cuisine" inception and i was most disappointed.  so, what with gas prices being so high, i decided to stay put and order indian food from the place serving up "the best indian food in town."  i ordered vindaloo chicken (take-out menu says 10.95 when i was actually charged 11.95), samosas (2 in an order, 5.95 on the menu, 6.95 in actuality), and palao (not listed... it cost 6.95).  based on the prices i saw on the menu for my dinner to come to 29.73 (with taxes), while i was waiting for my order i had concluded that the rice had cost $9....!  may i iterate again that the hostess was horrific (overbearing and an inappropriate hostess for a "fine" dining place) and since i don't care to run into her again, i don't care to go there again?  she also quoted me the wrong menu prices when i was the pipsqueak who piped up meekly, "uhm, could you tell me how much each item cost?"  (i so want to take this up with them tomorrow.)  the food....  oh were we disappointed with the samosas.  they came in a crisp and oily skin that got soggy (not taj's fault, granted) during the car ride.  k was surprised and dismayed to taste coriander in hers amidst the peas and potatoes and spices.  i was pleased to not taste it in mine but that would indicate inadequate mixing, no?  the rice was beautiful - there were red peppers in addition to peas and onions and only the faintest hint of cumin.  but worth 6.95 when there wasn't any meat at all?!?  i don't think so....  finally the vindaloo - the sauce was decent with finely chopped ginger and onion and spices in the hot-hot chili-hot sauce.  there was also coriander but its strength was diminished by the hot spices, i think.  and there were  four  - count 'em - pieces of chicken.  three moderate-sized and one small piece of extra dry white-meat chicken... for 11.95!  (personally i prefer the falling-off-the-bones chicken in curry.)  we were so disappointed....  wish me luck taking them on to get my $2 back.  i'm not cheap - it's just principle because you can't advertise a price and charge higher.  that's why i'm an satisfied advocate of  urlLink curry village  - best prices in town and tasteful decor and more impressive staff by far.

        quarter-life crisis   not feeling too, too hot these days.  i mean, some days i'm up and i'm feeling good about myself, where i am in life, and that i'm a-okay after it all.  i love my body and me and who's around me.  other days (like today, which is why i'm writing this), i'm too upset to continue (almost) - not so thrilled at where i am in life and pretty grossed-out by myself.   body:  it's split down the middle.  i work fairly hard to keep in shape but then i just love to eat and make up for all the exercise.  and somedays (like today) i'm in so much annoying pain that i wonder why don't i just choose to be sedentary and avoid the pain?  i feel prematurely old....  foot problems have relegated me first to "flats" (that were really inch-and-a-half heels) and now to truly flat flats.   what happened to diva-wyn of yore??   i still have the square-toed four-inch heel diva boots and they mock me - "haha, i make your feet hurt."  i still brave the pain for a sufficiently important (and rare) night out....  sometimes (and it is really thrilling at those times) i am reconciled to my thighs and calves because i think of everything i am able to do with them (jog, kick, walk around, be flexible) - but other times, i look at them critically and wonder, "is that what you call hot??  you could do so much better... perhaps."  i wouldn't say that i inherently want activity (i probably don't).  i ducked out of jogging for a whole month in april....  i do it to (only slightly) deter the weight and flab gain due to what i eat.   career:  well, i am however old you know me to be and i'm still in school.  and i have  one  degree.  granted, it's a really nice one degree and i set myself up nicely to do my next degree in not three but two years....  it's the reason why i'm really mired in self-pity sometimes because other quarter-life people have already started their careers and i can't exactly see clearly a year into my future when i should graduate!!  it's the reason why i'm not considering doing another degree.  in some ways, school didn't "work out," and i don't feel great amounts of self-worth telling someone that i'm a quarter-life person  and  still in school....   family:  this is the part of my life that i grumble the least over.  no one can deny that i have become the most dutiful daughter - and how much has that to do with not having a life here??  it wouldn't have happened if i hadn't returned but i'm thinking that if i hadn't returned here, some really awful things may have happened....  i still clash with my mother and sister in huge shouting matches but i love my father to bits and i'm his biggest advocate in the house.   relationships:  this is the hardest one to write about, by far.  people my age (and people just a bit younger than i am) say that their high school classmates are getting married leaving them the only single one in the group.  merely by accident (i think), i'm still surrounded by all single (unmarried) people.  that doesn't change that i'm older and i'm so ready for a relationship but there's no one up for it here.  i have a strong suspicion that i won't find anyone in halifax (uh, four eligible years here is enough time to determine that) so i'm just hanging in limbo or something... waiting to get out.  of course, it's all up to me how quickly i get out of here.   attitude:  i've really settled down from my "wild days" of rebellions.  it's strange.  it makes me feel old but it also surprises me that some people have chosen this way since their high school days.  i feel sad for people who are all about studying and opt out from living life while learning.  i didn't make the best choices but i don't think that being only-and-all about the books is a good choice either.   it's all about balance.   it's small consolation for some of the other things that bring me down.  is this what people experiencing a mid-life crisis do: revert to a younger version of themselves?  it's a very carefree feeling which is probably why people do it but, ironically, the fake-teenage-wyn that i become is unlike the actual-teenage-wyn that i was.  just like, i'll bet, the guys who buy a hot car when they go through their mid-life crisis were actually really boring people who were only concerned with their careers when they were younger.  if i can get over this, i hope that a mid-life crisis is not awaiting me as well!  (i need to get away... and go to vancouver this summer!)

        notes on multiculture     one of the other dancers said to me,  "winnie, you look so pretty with make-up on.  you should wear it everyday!"   considering how  little  i had on (but more than my usual  none ) and if she was being sincere, i will take that as something of a compliment.  after the dance, chris expressed how impressed he was - he didn't think we were as serious and coordinated (choreographed) dancers as we actually are.  so i'll take that as a compliment as well.  :)

        multiculture ------  urlLink pictures  !!!   it has come and gone - multicultural festival, that is - and not with a small feeling of regret.  but the happy stuff first!  :)  k straightened my hair and what a terrible task it was because it's so thick and long and plentiful.  i was late picking up nhung and very nearly dishonoured my word when she offered to take a cab instead of waiting for me.  duyen's house was the epicenter for activity.  there were dancers, male and female, spilling out of their house-on-a-hill and it really was picturesque because we were dressed in an assortment of colours this year.  there were also plenty of adults working together preparing food for the food counter.  i don't know if it can ever happen but i also want to be so active in my community (wherever i settle down) - there is no better feeling than knowing that you have been an integral contribution to a greater cause.  we practiced for a bit and i was surprised to find myself feeling nervous that i would experience a memory blank-out during the dance.  there couldn't be anything more disgraceful as the girls kinda see me as the steady one.  and before we knew it, it was time to head to the festival grounds.  i probably raved last year how much fun it was to be herded into the dressing room - to use the same preparation facilities used by performers (like natalie mcmaster!) of a far larger scale... it's as luxurious as a small stage can be!  and then in no time it was time to dance.  i could feel  butterflies in my stomach  as we heard the music for the chinese ribbon dance, the act immediately preceding ours.  and then it was us.  it was exhilerating - i thought there was a smile plastered to my face at times but the camera seems to indicate otherwise (oh well).  it was a great time as usual and  as usual the vietnamese girls (plus two chinese girls!!) were absolutely fabulous .  we took a storm of pictures afterwards, some of which you can see from the above link....  and i'll develop my roll in a few weeks time.  :p  and i was a bit sad because this is quite possibly my last year performing with the dance troupe and there is something kind of magical about the multicultural performance because we work so hard towards it and the setting is so beautiful (fresh salt-water wind just off the side of the stage).  ~sigh~  many of us wanted to perform again but it was already too late in the day to arrange that!  while it is awfully fun to be a volunteer and to trip around in traditional costume (a young girl found it necessary after the dance to approach me and compliment me on my dress and our dancing :) ), it is also fun to be a normal person strolling the grounds.  eugene (my photographer :p ), chris, and henry were (in retrospect) like three kids at a carnival - we tried out a bit of whatever inspired us, they played a carnival game and i was the lucky recipient of three stuffed animals in one day (haven't received so many gifts at once since my 8th birthday party....)  i haven't had this kind of fun before at multicultural...!

        lunch in the city   it wasn't easy to find a suitable place for lunch on thursday....  i wanted to show thuy thai food but i also wanted to try hakka food instead of thai.  that can all be accomplished at  thai chin  which is the only place in halifax to serve both thai food and hakka-chinese food.  but... it was closed for lunch.  the adjoining indian restaurant was open for lunch though so you can can be assured that there is a special chef(s) for thai chin and they don't have to work lunch hour....  wanted to try  baan thai  as well.  it is owned by the same people who opened  thai chilli house  and  urlLink karen  mentioned a while ago that it was better than tch.  but baan thai also wasn't open for lunch and they recommended that i go to tch which opens at 11:00 a.m. - there you have it - an open restaurant.  (grrrr.)  so i thought it would be cool if we went for eats at the  new bubble tea shop  that i had to hear of word-of-mouth because you know bubble tea shops have cool food (toast, taiwanese meat on sticky rice, noodles in soup....) so i asked for a food menu while in the shop and wanted to retract it just i realized he was going into the neighbour restaurant ( kinh-do , vietnamese) to fetch a menu.  neither of us wanted vietnamese food (particularly since most items are more chinese than vietnamese, and the pho is overpriced at 7.75).  so we promised to return after getting lunch elsewhere....  i thought we could go to  hamachi steak house  because after the first taste, i wanted to try the salmon this time but after walking around a couple of blocks to get there, we found a darkened restaurant, an engraved sign stating they were open for lunch, and a printed sign that said they were not open for lunch except on special (reserved) occasions.  i can imagine that a teppanaki chef charges a lot of money and when they can only charge ~$14 for lunch and when i went once it wasn't that busy that it wasn't really worth it to the owners to be open for lunch.  all this trekking was getting really irritating....  finally, i decided that we would go to  my other brother darrell's , a diner-like place that i've also wanted to try.  by the sounds of it, it's a cool place: it's going to have a lot of student clientele because it's located at the base of fenwick tower (largest student residence in the city); and there is a laundromat next door called "the missing sock" and it appears that if the laudromat was open, you can observe the progress of your laundry by a big billboard of lights indicating washers and dryers in use.  so i was exceedingly shocked to see the interior for the first time.  it is  very  diner-like but with some "funky" seats (the upholstery of my booth was ripped in a big gash but that was the exception).  you can see the kitchen behind a tall counter and ceiling fans lazily spun around to kind of cooled it off inside.  the door was wide open to the extremely humid day and we were the first people in line.  we only had to wait a few minutes for a table to pay their tab.  the menu was normal - sandwiches, burgers, pitas, pastas.  i ordered a tex mex burger (7.65) and thuy ordered a penne rosa-something (8.65).  the waitress informed me that the tex mex burger had grilled chicken (bits) and a beef patty and i still agreed to take it - we had walked around and waited so long for lunch!  and i was just in it all for a taste of mobd's famous darrell fries that were actually small potato wedges in a crispy and slightly spiced batter.  i should have gone for just a salsa chicken sandwich which was the alternative the waitress presented to me because the burger was nothing special.  thuy's pasta was quite nice for a place like that but we found the sausage that was in the pasta dish a bit dry.  pasta dishes are served with garlic bread or a side of caesar salad.  and then we were off for bubble tea desserts!  :)  you would have thought that some other place would be the first to have it in halifax and not a vietnamese restaurant.  but come to think of it, i can't think of a better environment (restaurant) to serve it with.  kinh-do is a restaurant with cafe-atmosphere and if you actually got vietnamese food, it is a better environment and fare for enjoying bubble tea than, say, in a gaudy "traditional" chinese-decorated resaturant with north american chinese food.  i mean... fried rice, sweet & sour chicken balls,... and bubble tea!  that is nearly sacrilegious and is probably going to be done!  kinh-do is also located downtown so it is a good central kind of restaurant from which the word can get out.  another first offered by the bubble tea shop (i don't know if it has a name!) is wi-fi access.  not free, of course.  it's like between 3.95 to 5.95 an hour for different kinds of access (depending on the equipment you bring in, i guess) - i didn't really note the prices because i was trying to memorize the nine flavours of bubble tea available: taro root, watermelon, honeydew, papaya, mango, strawberry, lychee, coconut, and darn i can't remember the last one.  i've never been able to watch someone prepare bubble tea (my failed attempt does not count).  the nice and friendly guy chatted with thuy (it was surprisingly that they didn't know or know of each other in this small city!) and i watched him add one scoop of flavour, one scoop of white powder, and then some hot water (stirring up the powder so clumsily in a mixer with a fat straw that it offended my analytical chemistry sensibility), and he added it to some "bubbles" that looked like they were in a layer of tea.  i ordered mango and thuy ordered papaya (supposed to be 3.95 each... :&nbsp;) ).  it was good.  :)  but there was this aftertaste that thuy didn't notice and it drove me crazy trying to pinpoint what it was.  apparently it came from the mysterious white powder and first it thought it was coconut then almond and finally i realized it was a soy powder so the funky aftertaste (not bad, but really odd to have with your bubble tea) was  soy drink .  that would explain why he didn't call it "milk tea" when i wondered why a previous customer had creamy-looking tea.  goodness, next time... well, i have some ideas but i certainly don't want to run around so much for lunch!  mobd's ----- address: 5576 fenwick street, halifax hours: open for lunch!!  kinh-do & bubble tea shop ----- address: 1284 barrington street, halifax   beauty & the beast   after lunch, we went shopping.  it was fun.  thuy could be a professional at it and i was hopelessly amateur by comparison.  shopping with her and i'm like the beast because she's the  extra-small girl  and i need to visit a gym more often....

         urlLink f5  for 2003-06-20      is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight?  long or short?   my hair is naturally straight and i like to keep it longer than my shoulders -- the favourite hair length according to men is some length past the shoulders so they sit on a woman's chest.   how has your hair changed over your lifetime?   in colour!  and more recently i waved it in a permament fashion.   how do your normally wear your hair?   down and parted on the side.  in a ponytail when i want to be "serious."   if you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   it would be straight and an even honey brown colour without having to wait for the dye-job!   ever had a hair disaster? what happened?   i guess it would only be having cut it too short to make my hair look really big.  waving it in a permanent fashion wasn't the best thing i've ever done and it's taking a long time for it to reverse itself!

        feeling of self-empowerment  :)   my computer (dell inspiron 4100, a year and a half old) has had problems for sooo long.  well, one of them dated back to a few months after i got it ( it wouldn't read dvds  but one - "the usual suspects").  then i don't know which one happened first: a few months ago, either  the cd drive died  altogether and when it crashed once, it rebooted with my precious  memory being halved  from 256 mb.  the memory thing, hopefully, is just an os thing and a re-install is required.  it was like a catch-22: couldn't re-install the os unless the cd drive worked (don't want to think of how many floppies win xp would need....!) and so i lived with half the memory for a few months.   dell support line  wasn't glowingly supportive but they did give me a new dvd-rom because the old one was deemed to be kaputt.  was trying out the new cd drive on a bad cd (apparently) so i thought that new dvd-rom was just fine and my computer (or os) was what was causing the problem and - again - how do you fix the os if you don't have a cd drive??  but it was my bad - the new drive couldn't read a data cd that must be scratched nor can it read a burned cd - but it can read anything legit... and once it's warmed up, it can read illegit cd's as well. :p  still only got half my memory but, hey, my computer plays dvd's.  it's like getting a whole new computer!!  :)  and back to having a  portable multimedia center ... sweet.  :)  but... i might just blow up my computer (figuratively speaking) by changing the os.... wish me luck!

        nothing better to do....   than to do stuff for myself.  like studying and researching and working and working out and concentrating on my family and friends.  and it's been long overdue, i think.  last week our jogging group leader was reveling to us how great it is to be single - how much more efficiently his system is currently running without a female present but i won't subject you to the other nerdy cs comparisons that were made!  :p  i whole-heartedly agree.  when i'm not single, i might not necessarily do much more going out than i do presently but there is the time commitment that i think is worth more than hundreds or thousands of dollars you put into a relationship.  either you can make all the money back or you won't feel it ten years down the line but you can't  not  feel the loss of time or giving up of yourself (i.e., revealing your personality) if you don't end up with the person in the end.  being more efficient and being able to do whatever you want... is about the only upsides of being single.

          till the bitter end....   in  urlLink found locally , the  bitter end  is listed as one of the top five hip  see-and-be-seen  bars.  it ranked up there alongside cafe mokka (no longer in existence), velvet olive (agreed, it's  cool ), duffy's speakeasy, and eagle dance bar, pub, and eatery....  so that is why i was so adamant to try the place.  it happens this way to me: a place's name pops up more frequently than usual and then i really want to go there.  recently andrew recommended it to me and then it came up elsewhere in conversation (not actually as a recommendation) and i'm on the lookout for alternatives to bars anyhow (like fireside, gatsby's, economy shoe shop, la cave.... each has their own personality for a different kind of night out).  it was raining on saturday night otherwise you would expect their sidewalk patio area to be open and littered with people who could stand sitting outside in their going-out (read: thin) clothing because they are being heated from within from alcohol.  the place inside is nice.  i have to say it reminded me of the olive... a little less plush though.  there are two rooms, both appearing about the same to me, i guess.  the walls are a warm yellow in colour while the furnishing as darker (navy blue?) so the whole place is softly cast by the hanging halogen lamps.  we were sitting in one room and when i looked over into the other, it had the feeling of a gallery with some kind of exhibition occurring and people mingling with drinks in their hands at the bar or at tall tables or short tables.  however, our table was wobbly.  the menu is really nice (unfortunately i can't comment on the food because i don't think the kitchen was open at midnight!).  cocktail selection was pleasingly large (i wanted to order something!) and well-priced (starting at 4.25 for a single, 8.00 for double high-ball or something).  there was also a large assortment of frozen and creamy cocktails, too.  the velvet olive is touted to have the best martini but how would i know when i never get a menu there....?  the martini selection at the bitter end is really good (better than fireside) and they start at 8.00 for regular.  (sundays are martini night at bitter end  :)  where it's 5.00 for a regular martini.)  some of the servers weren't that great and i was disappointed to encounter attitude there.  it wasn't a busy night for them (they will see better in the summer) so even as we weren't hugely continously drinking customers i think we deserved better treatment and attention than we did for the first ten minutes we were there - which was absolutely non-existent.  the girl who eventually served us was nice though, quite attentive.  i'd like to go back on a weeknight - i think it would be more in tune with the mood i'm usually in (mellow) - because it was  noisy  on saturday....  like i said above - each place has a different personality.  it's the kind of place (on a saturday) where you want to get a few friends and drink a lot and let the volume of your conversation go up a notch.   another recommendation    urlLink the elements of style  by william strunk, jr.  a friend of mine is lawyer-in-training and recommended this book he's reading a little bit of everyday.  i strongly believe in the power of effective communication, too.

         urlLink f5  for 2003-06-13      what's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   once upon a time i wanted to do wild stuff like sky-diving and bungee-jumping and raving.  i haven't done any of that stuff and now i'm not so adventurous in my desires.  what do those experiences bring anyways?   what i really, really want to do right now is to travel to asia  (particularly china, japan, singapore, korea,....) and europe.   time is always my enemy...  hopefully not for too, too much longer.   when someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest   it depends on the person but  i tend towards trying to put things in the most positive light .   have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? what happened?   this is an ambiguous question....  sure, i have.  but i guess it is just a part of getting to know someone to see their good side (hopefully) first and then to learn more and more about them.  i try to keep my best facade always but it is tiresome and  it is better to be real .   if you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   three worlds that i have read touched me deeply: (1) reading about sixty  sweet valley high  books would do it - in sunny california where everyone has amazing looks and people are open-minded about everything (like being artsy and parents who support their chinese daughter when she falls in love with a white guy and he reciprocates), (2) the victorian setting of  anne of green gables  where i read about ten of those books - where things were just simpler!, and (3) san fransisco of a decade ago and of four elegant and well-adjusted thirty-something chinese-american women learning some life-lessons and sticking together through thick and thin.   what's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   oh, the ability to sing!  i can play the piano but i can't hit a note and bring music around with me.  :(

        first day at work   so i was approaching my new lab this morning with this strange feeling like it was my first day at work... strange, because i spent a year (two years ago) on the  eighth  floor for my honours work but now i've moved down the hall, on to bigger and better (well, my former corner lab where you couldn't swing a cat also expanded and moved since i was there).  ....and it was overwhelmingly fun.  i positively love the solitude that comes from escaping the incessant chatter and social mecca that is the cs faculty's building.  for a big difference from my other lab, everyone in lab speaks english so i understood dr. r when he was talking to his dr. b and just general exchanges in my vicinity.  (compared to how i wouldn't understand the half of what is going on around me if i had a supervisor in cs.  and how i didn't understand 100% of what was said in my honours lab.)  that means free and easy communication of ideas.  a technician from my lab got engaged to a researcher in the adjoining lab (which is really awesome because i knew them when they were dating a year ago) and we had engagement cake in their honour.  :)  i don't know what my computer is exactly but it is running redhat linux and is so fast (so sweet) and  mine .  but it was a short day because i had lunch plans to introduce thuy to her second japanese restaurant.  the original plan was  doraku  but i called and called at 11:30 and there was no answer: either they are never open for lunch or they are open for lunch on days  besides  thursdays.  read about our visit to  sushi shige  today (and all visits so far)  urlLink here  - if you don't, then just let it be known that raw scallop is like having silk slip down your thoat (which is a good thing).  and who would i see there but the very people i saw there the last time i was there: singer and dr. b.  small, small world and i'm getting to like dr. b more if he enjoys his raw fish like i do!  :p  i'm looking forward to going into lab tomorrow (provided i wake up early enough) and getting some results and brainstorming.  i hope it's not just a novelty thing and that the environment continues to be so stimulating... i think it will be.  :)

         cinnabon is coming to town!       yes, k and i were so sad that baskin robbins closed in mic mac mall (i have a serious penchant for x-mint ice cream - "dark chocolate ice cream infused with chunky oreo cookies and a swirl of blue mint ice cream".... who ever said mint ice cream had to be green?!) but the bright part is (besides that baskin robbins still exists at the other mall in halifax) is that  urlLink cinnabon  is opening at that location.  it's been a while since hali has had a cinnamon bun shop (&nbsp;mmm, it's going to smell so nice in that corner of the mall!&nbsp;).   urlLink read  about how i had to have it when i go to toronto!  ....these are a few of my favourite things.... :)

        yogaflex II   so i finally made it back to  yogaflex  class despite last time i said i would rise to the challenge and whatnot.  i had not been back since a few weeks ago because of scheduling and i didn't want to go with another instructor (though i can't say i was particularly thrilled with the one i had).  i don't think i will go any more.  not that i couldn't do it.  i believe that if you put your mind to it, you can move any part of your body - no training necessary.  that being said, i have been fortunate to have taken ten classes in  pilates  that while made me more body-aware i found so tiresome....  i think i'm just too  young  to do yoga.  i was fifteen minutes late for the class but still managed to be so restless for the remainder.  woulda felt better if i had opted to  pound the pavement  for a bit longer rather than ducking into the  serene  yogaflex class.  granted, my  core stability  really sucks but i can do all the flexibility on my own and more efficiently.  i can't help but feel when i'm in that class what a waste of time it is and how much i wish my father or mother could be there in my place because they could stand to benefit more than i do from the class.

        "he wouldn't know what do with me."   summer's on and i'm hooked onto two new reality shows: "for love or money" (because non-cable-me i never got to see "the bachelor") and "canadian idol" (funny how people across the country look so distinctly unamerican and half of them look like people i would see around this city - except they haven't shown the halifax auditions yet).  anyways, blah blah blah.  reality shows are unnecessary evils.  after "for love" and "canadian idol" are over can i comfortably swear off all reality shows (except "amazing race") because all the other new ones are pretty much just trying to cash in on the waning trend and only exist as very sad imitations of their successful precedessors.  on "for love" we can't decide if the bachelor is a good guy or not but we don't like him a whole lot in any case so while we want to continue to see the  good  contestants in future episodes, we don't actually want the better girls to hook up with the sleazeball.  this evening, stacey, unfortunately, was amongst five women to be sent off the show.  she was terrific.  she had the sleekest legs a mile long.  she was mesmerizing.  in the first show, she already stated, in a matter-of-fact kind of way that the bachelor had never met anyone like her.  she never had to put out.  she was a mystery.  cool.  i like to think that the guy realized that she was far too good for him and that if he kept her on the show he honestly wouldn't know what to do with her - could the blundering idiot entertain the queen?  i don't think so!  and he knew it to so rather than risking looking the fool on a date with her, he let her go.  thus far, i get the feeling that that statement applies to me, too: "he doesn't know what to do with me," because  urlLink i'm a creature unlike any other .  (did i just write such cheese?)  and i realized this from the occasion delving into some "woman-empowering" magazine (like cosmo, i'm being very sarcastic if you can't tell) and noticing that i don't think like the women they are targeting with their magazine.  i was simply brought up differently (but not without my own set of neuroses) and then i fancy that certain things that happened when i was seventeen-or-so were very formative into the kind of woman i am today.  unfortunately the reason that i think that someone doesn't know what to do with me is that i haven't found (but once, and that is another story) anyone in my league.  settling too low, you know?  so what i'm looking for... is my match.  and then i really wonder what i will do....

        match.com   which might lead to why i decided not to even think about the most recent  urlLink f5  questions.  for the record, they can be found at the end of this post.  i joined  urlLink match.com .  can't tell you the username i came up with but suffice it to say that coming up with it was an ordeal in and of itself!  i didn't want to call myself something kiddish like  sw33t_babiee  and i didn't want to personalize a normal name like  princess  with my personal set of numbers (like how some people chose 23, or 69) because then i may as well go there and call myself  princess_wyn  and probably not have a problem getting that username.  i even tried ones like  theoneforyou  and the system claimed that it was taken and nearly came to calling myself  pochaccofreak  but arrived at a suitable  "goddess"  nickname instead.  despite all that effort, i don't really care if i never get a match through that system.  i only joined because i was slighly influenced by a friend - the online-dating system actually works for her.  after all is said and done i prefer to meet people the old-fashioned way - through "work" (that is school now) and in social activities (clubs and student societies, not clubbing or house parties).  i'm following closely the trials of two people experimenting with these systems and i can only say (with complete bias) that things pan out better when you haven't met them in such an artificial setting under questionable circumstances.  i mean, who wants to be telling their children, "well, your daddy and i met because i was running through my match.com matches and he was the fifth one i responded to!!"  here was the friday5.     how many times have you truly been in love?  what was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most?  what qualities should a significant other have?  have you ever broken someone's heart?  if there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be?    i realized recently how unreasonably important  language  is to me.  i've been pining because when i was at waterloo i could understand everything going on around me because everyone was from hong kong or everyone was descended from hk parents and cantonese was the second most popular language spoken on campus (or so i'm guessing).  so imagine my disappointment when i arrive here and spoken mandarin that prevails may as well be hebrew to me.  while i have been thrilled that some of my colleagues also hail from south china, i have been horribly disappointed that some others are fluent in anything but cantonese.  i think i am most protective of my language because it seems so "unpopular" these days but also because it  is  communication (speaking, everyday!) and that is an everyday thing while the other areas where i am lacking proficiency - customs, history, literature, and cooking - may not crop up so often.  to that end, i always fancied myself with someone from hk or someone like me with parents from hong kong (so we'd have funny accents together, and teach our kids blasphemously incorrect chinese) or someone who would learn for my sake (and have a funny accent that i might never get over).  when someone asks me for the qualities i look for in a significant other - this language thing is just choking me because i want to list that as the first quality.  in my opinion, that enhances the communication possibilities far more than with someone who doesn't speak my language.  and  that  is why i'm so unreasonable about the importance of language.

        to be the best... or not to be   there is one professor here who is world-class, front-runner in his field.  in  my  field.  getting to work in his lab would be a really awesome thing.  in fact i was told such yesterday from a non-biochem type as well.  so i'm deliberating whether or not i want to be the best or something middling.  some decision was made for me yesterday: that is, an  obvious choice  was made and of the two dr. b is better suited to be my supervisor.  i was thinking that dr. r (who is incredibly nice) was the phd student of this world-renowned professor and with them being very close collaborators and with the two labs being adjoining with a door that doesn't close i didn't think i was shooting myself in the foot at all!  on the other hand, being dr. b's first student in the university's new bioinformatics program is pretty exciting stuff!   and  dr. b chose one over the other for his post-doctoral work....  that leaves one more professor to consider before the supervisor decision is finally made!

        miscellaneous stuff      i finally get around to commenting about the most recent visit to  urlLink sushi shige  last friday with singer and sam.  from readings and classwork and other such stuff in my  web programming  class i'm a bit wary about posting because on one hand i'm thinking that i'm just adding to the confusion and chaos that is web content and apparently this blog ranks fairly well for things i am actually very unknowledgeable.  what's the point?  but at the same time it's a creative thing and not to say that i was ever really creative before but besides dancing this  is  my only remaining effective outlet.  (this reminds me of the first web programming class where the prof asked, "how many of you have a blog?"  no one answered although i  know  one of my classmates is actually writing his own blogging tool... so i wasn't going to answer as well.  to which my professor responded,  "good, it's a waste of time anyways!"   i have my own reasons for blogging and keeping the lines of communication open....  otherwise, due to some extreme procrastination so far, i'm swimming in work.  project proposal is due on wednesday and for the first time in my graduate career i'm going at a (big, 70%) project  alone .  well, i have the support of my professors in biochemistry ( urlLink dr. roger  and  urlLink dr. blouin ) and yesterday i was bestowed a computer and account and today i will be given a key.  my own space... finally!!  :)

        bouncing off walls   and without the usual aid of caffeine, mind you.  i just got off the phone and usually i'd be dead tired (asleep) at this late hour but i'm giddy and it's been a long time since i've been set so hyper but i'm confining myself to my bed and my comforter feels like a straightjacket.  actually, it's two phone calls that make me feel like rejoicing the  power of feel-good phone calls and good friends .  (have i gone back to not naming names?  for this entry, yes....)  ar probably doesn't read this anyways, but i also talked to p and i can't pinpoint what in the conversation set me so  happiiii  but it does.  i might not be doing so hot in my everyday life and some stuff gets me down but we mention those things and we mention the good and we talk like there isn't a great big divide of a harbour (in the case of ar) or a thousand miles (in the case of p) and i feel cozy and cared for and seriously in touch even though i haven't seen ar in what feels like weeks and i haven't seen p in months.  i suppose i grew up with a negative chinese idiom that translates to "you are who you hang out with." (which is "muk yuu leuy jeuy".... my mum said that to me so much and i tuned it out but it translates roughly to something dark dirty spot attract more of the same trouble... i should have listened more carefully!)  because i got a-lot-a-lot of grief over who i hung out with (or rather what my mother perceived of who i hung out with).  maybe that can be the long sought-after explanation for the bleh feeling that i get when i hang out with someone too long.  i see the square pattern on the lamp in the master bedroom.  it reminded me then of tofu and i still associate it with tofu.  (which i love to eat.)  sometimes i call it the "tofu-feeling" and at one point set my mind to document as best as i can what brought it on.  but it never seemed important enough to.  i remember trying to explain it to p when we were in kw....  i try not to make a wretched face when i feel nauseated after hanging out with someone too long.  at one point i thought that that would be the way i could tell if a guy was wrong for me because i got "that feeling" that makes me want to flee but i rarely do (flee).  and though no one (obviously) so far has been right for me i can also say i haven't not been immune to that feeling with anyone i have spent time with so far.  i can get that feeling while hanging out with girls as well.  i would love to meet someone with whom i never get that feeling.  now that i've grown up, i wonder alarmingly if it isn't a fear-of-commitment / staleness feeling.  it could very well be.  it's raining really hard outside... i get hyper when that happens too.  it's a rare, rare time when i get hyper and insomniac.  i'd write more thoughts but want to expend this energy somehow....  tell you how i did it later....

          mediterraneo   a while back, when i blogged about cora's,  urlLink karen  suggested breakfast at  mediterraneo .  it's a casual restaurant on barrington street (downtown) serving lebanese and canadian cuisine (i didn't know that but i guess i should have from the name of the place!).  very sparse tables, kind of cafeteria-like, definitely eatery-like.  (sorry, it was over a week ago and details and prices are escaping me....)  i ordered a "regular" grapeleaf plate and chris ordered falafel plate.  i mean... are you supposed to order canadian dishes there?  supposedly it is good for it's breakfast and they also serve pasta, etc.  there were many other lebanese dishes that i think are worth trying.  the grapeleaf plate came with 12 grapeleaves made with some pork, onions, and rice.  they surrounded a greek salad (choice of greek, caesar, and garden).  some of the grapeleaves were good, some were a little dried up.  four falafel (how do you pluralize that?!) came with salad (?) and pita bread....  i'd like to go back again and try in a really down-to-earth setting (and prices) all the other dishes (kibbi anyone?) that i've never heard of but bet that it isn't served up badly there at all based on the quality of our lunch.  location: 1571 barrington street, halifax

        the real way to have a chinese tea ceremony   so, during my esl session with david today, i asked him what the customs are associated with the tea ceremony and he told it to me from the beginning....  the groom arrives at the bride's house with an even number of "brothers" (groomsmen) and the girls aren't easy about opening the door to them.  so they have devise ways to convince them to open the door, like promise lots of money!  they might even knock and try to tear the door down, the point is the girl can't be taken so easily.  once he is in, they serve tea ( sun po cha , "in-law tea") to the bride's parents and older married relatives of the bride.  they sit in the center of the house for the ceremony and enjoy  tong seuy  ("sugar water," sweet soup) before heading over to the groom's.  the groom's eldest relatives are served first (like his grandparents).  i learned that it is okay for the couple to not have prepared the tea.  and after the ceremony, in a traditional chinese ceremony, they would hang out and eat, which is what w+w did (and we found it so odd that the graceful bride was eating mouthful-sizes of sandwich).  david told me the groom's party will sprinkle  hong jo  (red dates) and rice on the bed.  symbolism:  jo  is part of this expression where it has another meaning and it says, "early, quickly, have your sons!"  and rice on the bed is just to ensure that you don't go hungry....  a far cry from rose petals, huh? :p  a traditional wedding dinner has 12 dishes (don't know if that includes dessert) and in total four soups are served: three salty ones throughout the meal, and one sweet one at the end.  they will serve shark's fin soup (expensive) and seafood because if they don't, the groom will be viewed of as being "mean."  other must-have items are shrimp ( ha , sounds like laughter) and chicken.  the groom (and bride?) goes around to every table to make toasts and they carry one bottle of wine for him and one bottle of water so he doesn't get too drunk.  he'll drink wine if the table he is toasting insists he drinks wine.

        day four: go east   have you been reading from the  urlLink beginning ??  0950 pst july 27 (somewhere over sk, i think)  i can understand  urlLink dietchick's   eagerness  to get on to the next step of her relationship.  it's like, "when will 2 years come?"  because there is security in making it that long, perhaps.  two weeks, a month, a few months, a year... that's all so brand new compared to 5 years, 3 years (w+w's engagement), 2 years (ade and her bf).  it makes you want to  know  right now what's down the road because if it's not going to work out, wish to hurry up time, have that break-up over with and move on to the next one....  and if it does... we (dc & i) have to enjoy the present regardless in addition to the daydreams because it's never coming back to this stage.

       2100 ast july 27  our four-hour layover in toronto was not wasted because paul was super accomodating and met me and k at t2 and took us to sicken-yourself dessert.  ooops.  did i spoil the surprise....?  :p    yes, he took us to  caffe demetre  in etobicoke (at 550 rexdale) upon my suggestion for a dessert place not jd's.  like the other one that i visited a couple years ago in oakville, the decor is colourful and kinda jazzy.  they played italian music there.  after somewhat careful and long deliberation, all three of us finally decided what to order.  k ordered "snob a peel" (tiramisu, chocolate, and another chocolate ice cream banana split).  i ordered la vida mocha on a waffle (tiramisu ice cream drizzled with chocolate fudge and sprinkled with cinnamon).  and paul ordered tongue depressor (chocolate ice cream and chocolate fudge drizzled with triple fudge and sprinkled with chocolate and white chocolate chips!) on french toast.  yummy and filling and very sweet!  the price range of our desserts were ~7.00 and milk costs you 2.75 (you need it, but it comes warm) but you're really going to get your sweet tooth satisfied!  more importantly is that paul did come ( thank you ) and put up with the circus act that is me and my sister.  he successfully fielded discussion in both our research areas - which i find to be amazing - and otherwise gave me pointers (as he usually does) that i will keep close to my heart.  my head is planning the next trip to toronto as i write this.... :D  sigh.

        day three: chow wedding II   have you been reading from the  urlLink beginning ??  0750 pst july 27  okay, yesterday was fun.  mucho fun.  and i'm not being entirely sarcastic.  right now we're flying north with the rockies to our right.  high, imposing, "god-like" (according to k).  it's not just a mountain chain, like single-file, but a sea of mountains.  does anybody live down there?  ("yeah, mountain people!")   k (referring to the mountains and their  god -likeliness): "He created that.  good job!"   getting ready for the wedding wasn't a great deal of fun.  it would have been so much more convenient at home - like i could change what i was going to wear!  it's funny because i'm completely in my element when it comes to being "dressed up" to go to school or out but i get shy when it comes to preparing for a more formal event.  i don't mess overly with my hair ( snaps  for k for painstakingly straightening it for me) and my swipe of mascara, powder, and lip gloss is all the make-up i'm willing to attempt whether going clubbing, performing, or to a formal event....  guess i'm beautiful to not have to cover it all up... or seriously  make-up inept .   chingyee's  house was like a checkpoint for out-of-towners or what meg called "easterners," here for the wedding.   daicao  and alain came by the house and we all set off to attend the tea ceremony at will's aunt's house on w2 nd .  they have an awesome view, which is why i wanted to note the address and so two walls of the living room are all glass to look over the trees and then at the skyline and the mountain backdrop.  no other decoration was necessary in the living room!  being on time, we hung around and waited.  and ate vietnamese sandwiches, chinese  yuujuu  (pork with crispy skin), sushi, and watermelon! :p  the chow family was so outnumbered.  about 5-to-1 by the lin family (will's mother's family).  like at the last wedding (will's older brother), we were a tight and shy clique.  k went off to play table tennis with meg (i wish i had gotten a picture of that!) and people kept thinking that since i was standing nearby, i was  chingyee's  daughter.  no....  i had the weighty responsibility of representing the locks (or halifax chows).  when the bride and groom arrived - ohh - it was worth the wait.  wendy was so beautiful (strapless dress with pretty beading from westminster) and k and i fell to trying to figure out who she looked like.

       apparently they were late from the tea ceremony at wendy's (separate tea ceremonies at the bride's household and then the groom's).  it was odd to see them doing it to untraditionally in white dress and tux.  (isn't it bad luck in western culture to see the bridge before the ceremony??  in the dress??)  it was a moderately irreverent ceremony - joking and stuff.  tea was served (the bride and groom did not prepare it themselves) - who knows if the order of serving was quite right....?  they even served tea to will's older brother (married only last year).  the tea ceremony is supposed to be performed  after  the wedding ceremony.  hmm....  i'm gonna have to research this for my own wedding and do it just right.  ;)  then we headed to ubc's university golf club where the wedding ceremony was performed in the garden.  it was a beautiful day for it (apparently if it's not raining, it's a gorgeous day in van - not like our fog).  it was informal - we did not all sit but it was beautiful nonetheless to hear and see them exchange their vows.  after the ceremony, we hung around waiting for our turn (chow family) to take pictures with the bride and groom.  in the meantime, we mingled amongst ourselves and grabbed up photo ops of us six single cousins.  oh, and sampling the hors d'oeuvres.  :)  we had some time to kill until the reception so  chingyee  graciously drove us around  ubc campus .  it was  massive .  they have every kind of sports facilities - including indoor and outdoor pool, and an indoor tennis facility.  it is a campus definitely amenable to active folk.  there were also more buildings and faculties than our overwhlemed heads could keep track of including the really glassy and modern materials science building, the dowdy law building, really old dental sciences building, and modern cs building.  yes, not too descript.  i'm sure you can see pics at the ubc site!  then we went to  granville island  because curiosity got the better of us.  when we drove across the underpass and the sign "granville island" appeared before us, i felt like we had signed on to visiting a carnival.  in some places it really seemed like it - like the "kid's market."  we visited the mature shops  (paper ya was a cool shop selling all sorts of paper-products that are really chic.)  and the market.  we walked along the boardwalk to view the other offerings: water park, houses on the water, a "harbourfront" crossed many times daily by the aquabus, condos, hotels, restaurants, a community center, and industry (microbrewery and concrete factory).  apparently the same concept has been attempted elsewhere but with far less success.  we returned to the university golf club ("everyone is welcome") for the reception.  k and i sat at a "cousins" table but we were sadly smaller in number from dinners of yore.... :(  ade's younger sisters were assigned elsewhere because they are so much younger than we are.  will was, of course, at the head table and so was dann who being mc and married removed him from our single world.  so the "cousins" were only alain, ade, me, k, and we'll say ade's bf jason to boost our numbers!  two dentist friends of will & wendy and their dates also sat with us.

       instead of the (chinese?) tradition of clanking your glass to get the bride and groom to kiss, we had to be able to go to the front and answer trivia questions about wendy and will.  great tactic for people to share how they know the couple.  we cousins were disappointingly unknowledgeable about w+w as a couple but this was made up by their colleagues.  through this, we managed to learn about the couple and wendy so she became real to us.  the dinner was fabulous.  for appetizer: prawns (3) and scallops (3) in a garlic butter sauce decorated with julienned carrots and onions.  for salad: mixed greens in a mango ginger vinaigrette with almonds.  for dinner: 10 oz. new york steak with mushroom sauce with roasted potatoes and vegetables or stuffed (with crab and spinach) salmon with parmesan penne and vegetables or spinach and ricotta cannelloni.  all very, very good and exceptionally good for wedding food according to alain who goes to weddings.  dann made a really moving speech.  well, to me, at least.  will is a chow after all.  :)  they played a "how well do you know your partner" game: w+w versus a couple dating 5 years versus a couple married ten years.  it was hilarious because the married couple won, the dating couple same in second, and the newlyweds came in last - the final results were correlated to the time a couple has known each other.  then a slide show.  it kind of made me well up with pride becuase the chow family got its glory in the early pics.  wendy became a person to me instead of just being a picture and they have both done good.  finally, dancing.  we did better than the  gweilo  wedding in the dancing.  there was a surprising number of older couples who have been taking dancing lessons but you know what?  if a couple has worked it through 30+ years of marriage, learning to dance together is a walk in the park.  anyways, you wonder where chinese people party - because it's not in the clubs?  at a big chinese party - in a conducive environment with four generations present.  that's where we really get down and party!  final notes: (0946 pst) 1. k noted that just the two of us girls traveling was kind of odd.  why is that?  it was more fun than any scenario i could think of that i've been through.  we don't need parents or some guy protector! 2. we've been to toronto a zillion times.  yet when we fly there, we're plastered to the airplane windows trying to make out landmarks.  are we hillbillies then?  no....  i think we just really appreciate and soak up all the views we can get. 3. vancouver has a really awesome personality that i didn't know about.  i hope that this personality doesn't change because it's unlike any other in canada.  that's all from vancouver.

        day two: the lo(c)k family   have you been reading from the  urlLink beginning ??  2234 pst july 25  this morning we woke up with ease at 6 am and found ourselves slightly trapped for about three hours.  we have a spectacular view of the mountains from our bedroom and we haven't figured out what a patch of whtie lights on the mountain side corresponds to.  at least in this neighbourhood, there is a "garage alley" - an alleyway between residential streets lined only with garages so that from the front, all the houses are small and narrow-looking.  when  chingyee  (my aunt cindy,  yee  means my mother's sister) pulled into garage alley at 11 pm, we thought either (1) "whoa, we're slumming it!" (but it turns out to be a nice house) or (2) "very scary shortcut to be taking!"  we walked along the street we live on and arrived at dunbar community center and memorial park.  swingsets and jungle gym provided us with ample spirit-freeing while we play the waiting game for relatives.  some  initial impressions of a bluenoser upon yvr : 1. picket fences are replaced by tall and imposing hedges.  adds to the greenery. 2. it's sunny and warm by 8 am.  in hfx, we're waiting perpetually for the fog to "burn off," so that we may enjoy the sun.  and so often it doesn't.  we didn't think of sunglasses that we so needed by 10 am. 3. the green traffic signal flashes throughout the time it is green.  hmm, i wonder why. 4. maybe it will change elsewhere but things are more spread out than in canada's other big city; it is calmer and quieter and sunnier and greener. 5. garage alley... cool! 6. no composting in vancouver.  we rock in halifax!  i always know i've left home by noting the license plates around me: "beautiful british columbia."

       2348 pst july 25  k: "the twins are supposed to come out at the same time!" (shaking her head in disbelief because our matching suitcases did not get loaded onto the conveyor belt together)  w: "oh, hi meg and karin!  sis...." (i greeted our 12- and 15-year old cousins who look identical to each other)  k: "oh...."  on our way to vancouver, k and i practiced how we would great our long-lost relatives (we are actually the long-lost ones).  my father's older brother is  daibaht  (meaning "big uncle," the uncle who is the older brother of your father) and his wife is  daibahtneung .  daddy's younger brother is  samsook  (meaning "third uncle," the uncle who is the younger brother of your father) and his wife is  samsum  (meaning "third aunt," the aunt who is married the younger brother of your father).  we have two  brothers  who consider us to be their  sisters  because we all share the same last name.  our relatives we are staying with are related to us by our  mother's side and hence aren't our sisters.   daibaht  came to pick us up at 11:45.  as he drove us to the restaurant, he told us the food in vancouver is better than that in toronto so we were biased even before we entered    sun sui wah seafood restaurant .  there we met our paternal grandmother ( mahmah ), our identical-looking uncles, our 15-year-old younger brother, jason, and jason's maternal grandparents whom we addressed as if they were our own maternal grandparents, calling them  popo  and  gonggong .  sun sui is a modern restaurant.  i admired that they even sprung for having their name printed on the napkins.  we ordered bbq pork steamed buns, chicken and vegetable steamed buns, taro root cake (more fragrant than in t.), chinese radish cake, shrimp dumplings (good!), beef tripe, lean pork & pickled egg congee (bland), mixed nuts dumpling (different and quite good), chives-stuffed dumplings (good, good skin).  .... oh, too tired to continue writing.... more tomorrow.

       0557 pst july 26  i think  daibaht  was right:  the food is better in vancouver .  we were like the guests of honour.  they did the usual speculation of who looked like who.  k looks more like our father and i look like our mum.  somehow we look more alike as we got older....  our uncles watched k more and decided that she looks like our father but talks like our mother.  a long-baffling mystery has also been solved: the origin of k's cleft in her chin -  mahmah  has one, too.... so i guess she does belong to us after all :p  i'm pleased to see little jason has grown up into a nice young boy.  who knew i would have one fob brother ( manhong  who wasn't there) and one hip-hop brother?!  going to where all the lok family resides is like going home in some way.  after  ha mm cha  ("afternoon tea"), we split from  sam sook ,  popo , and  gonggong .  the first place  daibaht  took us to was  queen elizabeth park .  it was  really  nice.  there is a central flower garden with a beautiful and colourful display of flowers, a waterfall, and it was somewhat enclosed by greenery.  i walked with  mahmah  in the park and she pointed out the  backguo  ("white nut") trees.  she couldn't seem to reach the branches that had the nuts making me wonder if the closest ones hadn't been already picked off by other chinese visitors.... :p  i got a little carried away when walking around and talking to  mahmah .  it must have been the combination of scenery and air and i started feeling like i could really set up there.  she told me to move up when i graduate and settle down here and find a boyfriend here and i'm like, "maybe we'll end up here," and she got all curious like a girlfriend.  darned vancouver makes me say things i shouldn't.  :p  i'm a bit "promiscuous," too.  (too early in the morning to have a better vocabulary.)  it's not the first place that i've been excited to want to move to.  there's always toronto, and boston ( ***** ), and nyc.  note, of course, in the past few years i have also been to nb and elsewhere in ns and i didn't think  for a second  of relocating there!

       since we were such fans for a lookout,  daibaht  drove us up  cypress  - a ski hill/mountain - for a view.  jason was fascinated because he had only been there when it was snow-covered.  we could only stop at the higher lookout because the closer one was closed.  we could see all of downtown and stanley park, lion's gate bridge, and ubc.  the city(ies) sprawl such.  next, we went to my  yeye's  (paternal grandfather) gravesite.  it was a serious moment becuase it has been over 17 years and i have never before seen his grave.  i wish i had known him better and i know  mahmah  has been so intensely lonely without him.  not only do i get my family name from him but he also chose my chinese name  manwai  that means "wisdom."  i want to truly live up to the name given to me.  then we drove to the  capilano suspension bridge  and park.  apparently it has become very commercialized and entrance fees are not low (16.50 for adults, 12.50 for students).  apparently the bridge has been fixed up so it's not so dangerous so except for a lot of wobbling so you might tip over and get caught by metal fence, you had nothing to worry about.  the drop was quite awesome (unfortunately it seems every river's water level was really low).  we walked through the rain forest and breathed in the smell of pine - oh, wait - that's just the smell of drilling pine trees for construction in the park.  :p  in any case, it was really nice and lush.   daibaht  drove us back to vancouver via lion's gate bridge - not unlike our bridges in shape but it probably doesn't peel the way ours does after every summer.  :(  just so that we could say we went, we stopped in  stanley park  at prospect point for a picture.  i would be thrilled to go back to vancouver to jog on  seawalk  and maybe even go to a beach because they are in the city and thus popular.  they are  english bay  and  kitsilano .  as a matter of fact, i've been feeling like i've left the country because vancouver is so different form toronto and montreal.  when we drove along the coast, say, with english bay stretching along one side and businesses and condos and hotels on the other, i was soooo reminded of hawaii and particularly waikiki.  otherwise, it feels like i'm in california....  i've always thought i would become a go-go-go t. girl so vancouver seems so peaceful and slow-paced by comparison... we'll see!  we drove down denman street and then  robson street  that our  yeecheung  ( chingyee's  husband, generic for "uncle who is married your mother's sister") recommended for shopping.  we couldn't help it, we drove down the stretch of the street that is about five blocks long and two thousand times better than spring garden road and even better than newbury street in boston, and we were drooling amidst naming off all the stores: french connection, a/x, guess, max mara, bcbg, godiva, le chocolate belge, purdy's chocolate, death by chocolate, about 20 gelato stores, zin, the blue cactus, milestones (jas' favourite restaurant), aristia, lush, silvertalk, house of clogs, b2, lululemon (yoga gear, can't afford it), la vie en rose, la senza, dynamite, aldo, and, god, so much more.

       we just drove by it and drove to  chinatown  where all the posts on the street are painted red.  we got bakery goods at  maxim's  ( meisum  for "beautiful heart) and settled down for a light supper at    hon's wun tun shop  on keefer.  hon's looked a bit like a bright cafeteria - which is a good thing (not conspicuously dirty).  it's a place where noodles & meat in soup can be got for 4.25.  so i got  siu gnap ho  (roast duck rice noodles) and k got  gnau yuune lai  (meat balls lai fun noodles).  your choice of noodles was egg noodles (thin or flat), lai fun, rice noodle, and shanghai noodles (udon and soumen).  the  gong chow gnau ho  (fried rice noodle with beef) arrived insanely fast and our soup noodles and  wun tun mein  also arrived shortly after.  in all, four ample dishes (fried noodles feeds at least two) came to 22.96 and the selection was far more varied than i have described!  we strolled around the vancouver chinatown night market that was just setting up (every weekend in chinatown).  it brings back memories of  yehsee  ("night market") in hk that extended for blocks and the deals were a steal.  at vancouver night market the most prevalent stands sold bubble tea and all in all, it extended one block.  because we had some time to kill, we went back to robson.  very conscious that we didn't have all the time, we strolled quickly and only checked out stores not found in hali - or toronto for that matter because i'm  thinking  of going in october for three reasons: cousin warren's visiting canada, andrew's on wt in tiverton and has a  house , and, of course, to see paul.  oh, and shopping for myself and k.  ;)  then  daibaht  drove us home.  it was awkward parting but hopefully i can be a fixture in van or closer so we don't have to part so regretfully!  dinner out with the relatives was cancelled so we had dinner home:  six cousins  and even fewer adults.  after dinner was a riot because we got caught up about our cousins.  being the youngest, meg and karin had no idea until last night the dish on their older chow cousins.  would you believe that after dann and will's weddings a year apart, some money was riding on my marriage being next?!  apparently they were working with outdated information last year when such speculation was going on.... but, no, there's not going to be a chow wedding for a few years after these pioneers!  okay, now (0709 pst) it's time to get ready for today!

          day one: yhz -> yyz -> yvr    1850 ast july 24  so we're off.  on our way to t. and then to van. no matter what misgivings i, for one, may have.  we're still on the hfx-toronto leg which is very much "been there done that."  next leg i get the window seat.  the air tango agent knew how to be fair giving me the middle seat one leg and the window seat the second leg.  an airbus 320 doesn't seem so big when there are three babies on board.  for the first time ever when we went through security, we had to remove all electronic equipment from our purses.  so k and i filled a dish underwhelmingly with two chrome-coloured audiovox cell phones, my canon elph camera, and her chrome-coloured sony disman.  we are so low-tech!  the xray guy handed to me our huge gift of a glass chess set with a wink and a smile saying, "checkmate."  and as we ascended by escalator, a security guy walking past us said, "have a nice trip!"  this all comes from looking  fabulous  - not wearing sweats and sneakers and bearing knapsacks to travel but wearing svelte tops, slim pants and sandals, and carrying trendy purses.  entirely practical?  no.  really fun?  yes!!  at the end of it all, traveling with my sister is  super-fun ! :)  (sigh, too much "sex and the city" and "legally blonde"!)  something about not being able to cool down an engine or something delayed our lift-off from hfx.  ("our auxiliary power unit is not working today.  we will have to start one manually at the gate and start the other one out on the runway....")  meanwhile, the ac didn't work and we sweltered.  k and i linked arms until we were safely in the air and now we're doing our own things.  summer tunes recommended by  urlLink enroute  magazine: 1. my own summer (shove it) - deftones 2. summer's cauldron - xtc 3. summer of love - the b-52's 4. summer fun in a beat up datsun - cornershop 5. voila ete - les negresses vertes 6. liquid summer - dj keoki 7. les pluies chaudes de l'ete - etienne daho 8. that sunday, that summer - nat king cole 9. violence of summer (love's taking over) - duran duran  you gotta love canada where they recommend to you french music as a matter of fact along with the english language music!  ok, gotta work on my report.  i won't get done by itself and we're going to be  busy  when we get there!!

       2015 est july 24  the air canada agent who looks like kristi yamaguchi announced that we would not board for an indefinite length of time because there was a  red alert .  it turns out that there was a lightening strike and all planes were grounded.  not for long, however, we're on the plane now!  we looked for my cousin alain.  what are the chances he would also be on our flight to vancouver?  (not good, he took off 40 minutes earlier.)   *****  quick math: we were supposed to depart at 8:10 est and arrive in van at 10:20 pst ("2 hours") then add the est-to-pst difference (3 hours) - this flight is five hours long!  with the delay, we will arrive at 11 pm pst which is 3 am ast.  oh, we're going to be so tired then if we don't sleep during the flight!  while scoping out the other gates near our for my cousin (read: scrutinizing all asian men) it was impossible to miss the fact that there was like a  fifteen-fold increase  of chinese and other asians.  at the back of this plane, where we are sitting, we are surrounded by chinese people.  chinese people speaking cantonese, no less....  sigh, it's nice to get  far  away from all that is halifax!

       2135 est - somehwere over the great lakes, heading west of course  this flight is so long they will be showing an in-flight movie.   k: i can do anything in  can ada!"   that's a really great commercial.  i'm going to get the transcript when i get back!  k and i joke about how much we are going to drink at the wedding since we expect wine to be flowing and we are both  quite partial towards wine .  she says she might have one more drink than last time (which was two drinks in three hours) so we figured that she can have three drinks in three hours... or six drinks at the long party....  ;p  i'm too used to being the  designated driver  and sober to drink a whole lot....  and originally we joked about drowning our sorrows in drink.  what sorrows, you ask.  oh, how about that my prospects for marriage aren't quite so certain, and that nothing is quite so pleasing to my mother as what she knows of my cousins (they are brothers) both marrying full-blooded chinese girls.  mum thinks the situation is picture-perfect and wants no less than "perfection" for her daughters....  it could be worse.  i could be unattached single attending the wedding under the belief that all good fortune in the world has been monopolized by my two male cousins.  but that is not the case.  i'm happy to say i'm currently not an unattached single, that  good fortune and serendipity  has brought me to a really great guy and not all hope is lost.  therefore drowning of sorrows is not necessary and i'll probably cap it at two glasses of wine.  ;)

       2220 pst  we're really here!  well, still in the air.  there's a big splotch of lights outside to my left and smaller splotches around it.... but it doesn't seem to be vancouver because we're flying right by it.  hmmm, in our end of the country, you only see one splotch for halifax.  i think i'm really impressed by the fact that you can  see  the rugged coastline because there are numerous cities along it.  (on the east coast we have a rugged coastline, too, but diddly squat along it....)  okay, we've come to the monster splotch of light = vancouver at last.  i'm in constant delight over how we made it across the country in "4.5 hours."  sleeping - some.  reading - none.  :(

        live life....   to the fullest.  it's just really fitting when you're really out of sorts that you can't have it easy.  but after pushing it, it feels  really  good.  we went  jogging  yesterday (training for a  half-marathon , you see).  then  badminton .  running three times a weeks is good but badminton stretches me out way beyond just running....  i'll grumble now because my badminton skills have hit a plateau....  and i think a lot of it has to do with not having any defined goal for what i want to be able to do.  play singles?  really rock in mixed doubles?  100% awesome clears?  i think i really improved recently because of a piece of advice yang gave me (he won the cs badminton ladder but is otherwise not athletic so i sought his help).  i asked him how he managed to cover the court so that he dominates in singles (he's not overly tall either) and he told me that he only goes as far as he needs to go to return a shot... going any further is a waste of your time.  i have taken that advice to heart... except when i don't!  :p  last night i took thuy out to where her heart desires:  pitchman's pub  and then  the dome .  (repayment for dragging her out to bitter end so many weeks ago.)  pitchman's sucked and they wanted to charge $5 for us to experience the extent to which the place sucked.  (oh, i'm getting really catty here ;)  )  i didn't really notice it the last time i was there - a very packed thursday night - how many more guys there were than girls.  as thuy and i walked around looking for friends who promised to be there, too, we walked by booths of drunk guys who thought it was appropriate to make repeated cat calls towards us.  and when we ordered drinks, we were live bait for opportunistic old men.  (shiver.) when i got there, a drunk girl was standing on a table and shaking her stuff... she should be paid to not dance like that....  it was mildly distressing and i was more than happy to hang out at the couches tucked in the back with friends than be on the prowl... for sure....  and then the dome was the usual chaos.  i don't like it.  i've said that before.  it was pretty filthy that night and uncomfortably packed.  going with as many friends as possible makes the experience minimally unpleasant.  hanging out in the attic was surprisingly more fun than in the sardine-can dance floor.  it could have stood to be a bit more busy... but then we may not have gotten the comfy sofa!  then i had to work today.  just when i'm feeling the most sore.  i was busy enough and it's motivating to think of having pocket change for later this week except about 25% of my tables stiffed me on the tip tonight.  :(  i wasn't that spaced out, was i??  time goes faster when you're not concentrating on the burden....  oh well....  and i was so sore!!  somewhere in the midst of it all, i managed to work at my report due in a week and a half's time.  i think i'm in love with it - i love working on it and making it totally solid.  and  attempted  another assignment.  most rewarding were a handful of tete-a-tetes.   why?  attending one of my cousin's wedding and seeing all my relatives is undoubtably going to be trying and i need much inner strength to bear it all.

        interdisciplinary issues   about a month ago, i had to give a presentation to my intelligent systems class.  my project topic was like a  blip  amongst the systems that predict stock market trends, diagnose sars(1)/breast cancer systems(2 of them), and (good lord) intrustion detection systems (2).  i mean, everyone in cs understands the problem of sequence alignment because we all learned about it in our third-year core algorithms class but, holy, what i'm doing is about ten layers above sequence alignment.  surely enough, my first slide in the presentation was a multiple sequence alignment that looks familiar to cs-ers but then we all went for a tailspin because i looked around and no one cared beyond sequence alignment and that was  highly  discouraging.  my project is as esoteric as the engineers' projects in something-or-other.  :)  (grid station management or something.)  i had to throw out all the biochem terminology and drop all the recognizable cs terms to convince everyone that i was doing something in a similar capacity to what they are doing (only it's more interesting!!).  i mean... we're investigating the course of evolution by the analysis of the divergence in dna and protein sequences in different species.  from the divergence of protein sequences, we can also determine some things about protein structure (yay!).  people should care!!  it's not easy being so-called interdisciplinary.  i attended a masters defence where the committee consisted of one statistician, two biochemists, and an computer scientist.  boy, did i feel for him having to be an expert in so many things.  i aspire to handle it all better.  that is my rant for today.  :)

        life lessons (part I of ??)   they say to dress seriously in order to be taken seriously.  actually, my sister said to me that if i didn't get out of wearing clubbing-come-daywear, people wouldn't take me seriously.  not that i cared too much.  if seriousness is about excelling in school, my marks told a different story from whatever my clubbing clothes wanted to say otherwise.  these days i'm slightly more sensible (though nice and hot sunny days do something funny to my sensibilities sometimes) and more out of necessity (getting old), i'm dressing more casually than, say, two years ago.  and i think people have been inadvertantly taking me seriously and people might actually think i'm a nicer person now that i'm not wearing super-ice-queen, haughty clothing....  which might not be the wisest thing to do because i'm not so smart and i'm  not  so nice....   shopping   in just over a week, i'll be in vancouver.  today, k and i went shopping for a  wedding dress  for me.  i tried on flowery pink things and even a really daring white dress with wide black stripes all the way around but those didn't sit right with me.  the best one to work out was a strapless red satin dress that was fitted through the torso, had a red ribbon around the waist and fell with a red tulle underskirt just around my knees.  i felt like '40s movie star  in colour  but, unfortunately, it was a really red dress and i had to decline because i don't want to wear the same colour dress as the bride will be for the traditional part of her wedding.  finally, k (my favourite sister!) had me try on a strapless black dress at smart set.  it's kind of plain but i feel quite fabulous in it - the length suits me fine (just below the knee and not longer) and so does the cut (because the fabric isn't stiff or trying to have it's own form different from my form).   anyways  i'm excited now....!  :)

        brewdebakers   chris said he would take me somewhere that i (a) would like and (b) hadn't been to judging from my list of restaurants.  what he doesn't know is there are quite a few restaurants i have been to that i haven't reviewed because i haven't been there within the past year that i started reviewing.  so i thought there was a chance i had been to wherever he had picked (thinkin' of rocco's, heh).  i also thought there was a chance that he was referring to  my  restaurant as it does not appear on my restaurant reviews (too biased) - that would have been a  bad  joke.     brewedebakers tap & grill  is located on windmill road and it is is oft-overlooked by me because i hardly ever venture to that area.  the restaurant is adjacent to sleeman brewery.  in fact, there is a big window into the brewery (scary machinery!).  it's not so bad as that.... the rest of the restaurant is a converted warehouse with warm lights casting shadows on the crates and wooden structures throughout the building.  there were cozy booths and tables but mostly it was a remarkably warm place.  at first we wanted to order a seafood fondue (8.79).  imagine dipping pieces of shrimp and lobster into warmed cheese....  well, the server warned us that the dish was in actuality nacho chips that you can dip into a seafood dip.  talk about a misnomer.  it was nice of her to warn us and i know the disappointment of something not appearing the way i imagined.  so we ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops instead (8.79) and two chicken & rib combos (14.99 each) because chris said they were really good there.  (wyn:  gweilo  ribs?!?  now that's going to be an experience in itself!)  the appetizer was served in a hot skillet and looked like little scallop "filet mignons."  it was served with a red "seafood sauce" that i still don't know the contents of.  the chicken and ribs were good.  i'm a bit tentative because i'm not a big fan of barbecue sauce and that seems to be the only seasoning available.  the ribs were meaty and i think there were five or six rib bones to give you an idea of how much you get.  and you get a quarter rotisserie chicken (yum!).  and then you could get a baked potato or rice or mashed or maybe even fries.  if you look anywhere on the internet, you'll find a whole pile of warnings of what are so-called  "bad date" foods , like lobster dinner, spaghetti (i beg to differ), eating with chopsticks (for the uninitiated), and anything with garlic, onions, or vegetables that leave you with bad breath or pieces of food in your teeth.  if you're trying to be on your best behaviour for a date or otherwise, ordering these foods is somewhat counterproductive.  let me add to the list (1) food items that require your full attention and (2) unfamiliar places where you might not enjoy the food.  for me, at the very least, i like to have easy-to-eat food in order to be able to concentrate on the conversation  and  to delicately eat at the same time.  as for the second point,  i get a little sourpuss if i don't like the food i'm having because for me it detracts from the meal and enjoyable experience.  stepping out of brewdebakers, since it is such a large compound and with it's huge entrance onto windmill road, made me feel momentarily like i was back in mississauga (in the industrial area near the airport) just exiting from one of the many big-box restaurants they have there.  priceless.  location: 612 windmill road, dartmouth

        afternoon trip to the boonies   apparently the boonies isn't too far away from where i live because it was but a 20-minute car ride to reach it.     boon docks dining room & lounge  is located in an area known known as fisherman's cove.  not only did i not know where it was located (in eastern passage, while i thought it was in waverly), i didn't know that it's a tourist area.  one such that it may have been sunday but all the little shops nearby were open.  it's like a strip mall made of colourful fisherman huts converted to offer maritime paintings and arts and crafts, homemade ice cream (yum!) and live seafood.  there was an entertainer on the boardwalk playing the trombone and a lonely woman in traditional nova scotian costume singing gaelic melodies under the hot sun.  boon docks is like many other touristy seafood restaurants - lots of business and little care for the appearance of the place because people will come anyways.  needless to say, the restaurant had a marine theme.  their selection of seafood was awfully nice, though.  we tried to order the steamed clams (8.95) but they were out so we ordered caribbean shrimps and scallops instead (9.95).  i ordered calamari & fries with potato salad (8.95), mum ordered clam & fries with roasted potatoes (12.95), k ordered atlantic salmon fettuccine (13.95), and daddy ordered grilled salmon (9.95).  the appetizer arrive with a nice basket of bread.  we were horrified that our 9.95 appetizer could fit in a little bowl.  there were green and red peppers dangling out of the bowl and slices of mango.  when we dug around, we found three pieces of scallop and four pieces of shrimp.  the sauce was touted to be mango and black rum... we just found it to be bland, not sweet, not salty, and not rummy.  the clams were chewy and authentic and aromatic.  mum said the roasted potatoes weren't very good (too powdery) so she dug into daddy's salmon - he got about 6 ozs. of it anyways.  the salmon was served with his choice of fries, roasted potatos, potato salad, or rice and with a side of steamed vegetables.  my calamari was what you could expect from a packaged frozen seafood provider :p and served with some creamy sauce with orange flecks in it... i didn't like the texture (tasted like mayo) so lemon was more than a good enough seasoning.  k's fettuccine was butter laden.  the neat thing was how it came both with fresh atlantic salmon and smoked atlantic salmon.  mum says that the other two times she was there the food was much better (maybe they were too busy?) and we all agreed that the grilled salmon and clam and chips were the best dishes we ordered.  in any case, it's a good place for selection of seafoods and even a grilled salmon dish, as you can see, wasn't very costly at all.  afterwards, as we did, you can walk along the boardwalk, observed the muddy shores just outside, and walk off the very-full feeling because they did serve ample portions of food.  address: 200 government wharf road, dartmouth   "mummy's showing off!!"   my sister and i learned how to drive our standard transmission cavalier again....  it's been over a month since our first lesson and it was our first time out again....  here is what i  can  do right now: - start the car - start from a stop 75% of the time - shift gears - stop a moving car  here are the skills i am still lacking: - slowing down without stalling - checking side mirrors, rear mirror, blind spot, etc. while driving - start from a stop the other 25% of the time - keeping my composure when a car drives by me!  so when k suggested that i do some practical driving between the restaurant and home, i looked to my father who was our instructor and asked him if i was ready for it.  he was like, "no, no, no... maybe after another lesson."  but, hey, my sister who has better motor skills than i have, solicited a very strong "no!" from my father if she did the street driving instead!  part of me wants to just give up... how much longer will it take to drive in a real situation??  and mum wasn't helping us at all: she didn't attend our lesson and afterwards, she was taunting us, showing us how she could smoothly change gears from first through to fifth, and wondering what we could find so difficult about it all.  k whined, "mummy's showing off!!"

        aliant 6 th  annual dragonboat festival    so, just like that it was over.  the races, the festival....  but we spent a whole day out there and at times it really felt like it would drag on and on and on....  we arrived at 7:45 a.m. for our first race at 8:20.  over the past three years i had forgotten a bit what it was like to be in the race, the marshaling area where paddlers get off and hand over their life jackets to the next paddlers, the leisurely 200 m paddle to the beginning line, and how there is even time for a bit of practice.  that is why 20 minutes is allotted to each race even though the racing paddling only takes about a minute.  we kinda sucked the first race.  the seating order was all messed up and it seemed as if the race organizers weren't quite awake yet.  we didn't hear "attention please!" though a loudspeaker but rather from the people in the boat next to us.  and our team (the  orient express ) crumbled halfway through.  we did miserably in our heat but that was when we realized that in our heat were the winners from last year and the year before and some other seriously racers (like the micmac aquatic club).  it turned out that our time of 1:03.9 would have placed us first in most of the other heats.  a lot of lounging and precious little reading later, we learned that we were indeed in the top 27 teams and advanced to the 'a' semi-finals that were a whole six hours after the first race....  in the meantime, we ate "chinese" food that was free for us paddlers and hung out in our area (see, that is why it is better to volunteer than being a mere spectator), watched some martial arts demonstrations (while the hun gar looked clunky to me by all except the sifu, the tai chi demonstration was neat!), really bad live english music, lion dancing, and chinese dancing.  a few years ago, i ridiculed the chinese society for not having dancing for older girls.  there was a traditional mountain dance and the dancers were around the age of 14.  but in the past year, i have noticed the emergence of chinese ribbon dancing (a northern style of dancing) that with better (less scratchy) music, is quite nice.  i have seen the act with the women in pink outfits and that wasn't so impressive.  today, i saw a young girl perform a solo.  she was wearing a bright red-and-gold dress with long and billowing white sleeves.  she wore gold boots to her knees and multiple braid hair extensions and she was aerobic, not just marching on a spot as she waved her arms.  our second race was significantly better.  while the pairs were all shuffled around for the first race, we were back to the partners we practiced with and that made a huge difference (even though you don't interact with your partner) on our race.  we faced a very strong headwind and so were slower and by  eight  thousandths  of a second , we missed being in the top nine of the 'a' semifinals and so we missed being in the 'a' finals so we went to the consolation 'a' finals instead.  :(  our final race was great as well.  we finished second in it, which meant we were 11th overall in the competition (of 88 teams), and it was so close!  the nova scotia medical society were our hard rivals through out and finished four places lower in the consolation 'a' half a second slower than us.  that's how close we all were!  it was really great:  1.  to participate.   being a volunteer for a group meant you have an "area" to hang out in and we were there for a long time.  but we were also free to wander around and sit down in the public areas, too.  finally, there were vip passes that were passed around amongst us because we wanted to use the club washrooms (just across the street from us) and not the port-a-potties (five minutes down the road).  2.  to be part of the chinese society.   when i was younger and i went to multicultural and even when i was part of the gbc team three years ago mostly with chinese church people, i wondered what it was like to be with  the chinese society ....  not all that i thought it was.  they were busy all day selling food.  we weren't a tight group because there were just some so much younger and some older women as well.  but we could actually thumb our noses at our competitors (and we did) and yell at our opponents when we were all lined up at the start line, "we invented this sport!!"  3.  to see all the other teams that were there.   people at school are regular deadbeats but people in halifax aren't.  aliant, the gold sponsor, had many teams for sales representatives, technical support, and goodness knows what.  law firms and accounting firms and banks and the architect firm WHW - wet hot 'n' wild.  xwave sent two teams.  a tai chi group and a judo group.  the hong kong business association (that was mostly caucasian) and the nova scotia medical society.  boating clubs and powerhouse teams like nubody's and piercey's.  of course the breast cancer survivor teams were also well represented.  all in all, it was a fun outing.  we'll see tomorrow the results of today's tan.  :p

        ultimate singles activity   .... what do you think it is?  after a particularly gruelling day at school and with the prospect of catching an outdoor movie ( urlLink film festo alfresco ) falling through because it started to rain, i was tempted to ring up single friends for some  spontaneous kill-friday-night activity .  but doing so wouldn't have been very  independent  of me so i hie me homeward instead.  on the way home, i stopped at  urlLink chapters  because tomorrow's going to be a long day at the lake and maybe i could read something that complements a pulsingly hot sun.... hmm....  hanging out at chapters was nice.  it was great to pick absorb if only temporarily just how much is out there that i'm missing because all i ever read these days is textbooks and papers.  the wealth of current novels is just too intimidating and fast pace to me so i just stick to the classics but have no idea what to read next.  maybe i should give an  oprah's pick  a try now that she's recommending classics.  her first recommendation was  urlLink east of eden .  oh, if i had remembered that i would have looked for it....  they say in many sources that bookstores are great places to meet people but it seems highly odd to imagine that in a store as contemporary as chapters but there will be more eligible people there than at a really small bookstore....  i did spy a older, cute-looking chinese-looking guy with cool spiky hair... he was too short and probably married so i turned my attention back to "the mysteries within."  :p  the perfect cap to the visit would have to be able to enjoy a  urlLink tazo chai  at starbucks with the books but i had to buy them first and enjoyed my chai during the car ride home... by myself.  :)  here's what i bought - just a sample of my eclectic taste.  i'm not going to finish a single one for probably a year.... :(  it's just today i felt like splurging and bulking up my library!  -  urlLink the mysteries within: a surgeon explores myth, medicine, and the human body  - sorry, i'm a geek.  :( -  urlLink the picador book of contemporary chinese fiction  - it consists of 21 short stories (read: less attention and time required to complete a story). -  urlLink the perfume guide  - just for fun. -  urlLink complete guide to pilates, yoga, meditation, and stress relief  - i'm interested only in the first three sections.  stress relief i pretty much know what to do... sports!

        studying   i like how everything was swimming in my head for  advanced web programming  but now it's not.  how yesterday i had no clue about the accuracy of my class notes and today things fall into place (better late than never!) and i can verify (or not) the accuracy of notes i had taken in class when my head was in a complete and total muddle.  i knew from the start that this class is a  "learn on your own."   that phrase, like "i trust you," sends shivers down my spine like you couldn't imagine because i know it's not my forte at all.  (my forte is more like, "learn after seeing it explained five times!")  of course, for the majority of the other grad students this means "learn in a group," but, as usual, i'm defying herd mentality.  i flatly refuse to study at the cs building's open areas (no closed areas available any longer) and i'm studying at the science library and there is nary a cs student in sight studying here.  so for me "learning on your own" really does mean learning on your own.  i  am  proud of me.  prouder if i do well on the test so i'll just get back to studying....

         urlLink f5  for 2003-07-11 (all about friends)       do you remember your first best friend? who was it?   yes, i remember because now i think back it was so weird and even as a 7-year-old i didn't know how to handle social situations diplomatically.  in grade two, i was friends with jill and colleen and they told me to choose one as a best friend and i don't know why i couldn't have both (maybe there was some hate between the girls that i didn't know about??) and i don't know how i acted towards jill after i chose colleen over her.  colleen and i stayed best friends for a few years only but that's another story.   are you still in touch with this person?   nope.  lost touch with her when i changed schools.  even back then i was pretty lousy with keeping up friendships.  we were drifting apart anyways.   do you have a current close friend?   several, in fact!   how did you become friends with this person?   but if you want me to describe how i met one, i'd tell you the weird story of how i met paul.  at waterloo, at the end of first year (though he would swear we met in october) when we were all mad studying for finals except for paul who didn't need to and we'd be studying in the v1 caf and we'd see him when he came down to disturb us on his study breaks with his ultra-crazy and hyper antics.  but we really became kindred spirits after a marathon movie session ("strange days" and "se7en") and the crazy ld work term that followed 1b!   is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? why?   it would probably be natalie from my first year at waterloo.  she was awfully nice and a good girl but i wasn't ready for that when i was seventeen and way too restless.

        inspiration    happy news:  i have a supervisor.  was supposed to find one three months ago (and you could say that i did) but i was "testing out the waters" until now and dr. b is great to work for.  i like the feeling of belonging to someone, and to a group.... :)  that means i have a home now in the social mecca that is the csb in the new space on fourth floor  farthest  from the chaos... well, when his office gets built and stuff.  :p  he is very inspiring because he did his phd in protein chemistry but now he's in the field of bioinformatics and molecular evolution.  obviously that required becoming an expert in molecular evolution and phylogenetics and when he needed to learn how to program and basically use a computer, he did so so now you may not be able to tell that he isn't a cs geek (especially now that he's a cs prof).  and when he needed to learn stats and math (what do biochemists need with it??) to collaborate with mathematicians and to understand his results, he did so cheerfully as well.  i'm in awe and he's still so down-to-earth!  so i am now pleased.  :)

        like mike   i have a friend mike (i don't think he reads this but you never know) who is trying to see how productive a person can be in a day.  i think that could be a bit difficult because i think paul would be a very hard contender for  "most productive person"  but it seems to be a really worthwhile goal in any case.  i mean, if he "fails", he still has accomplished a lot while he's been at it and i think that is very inspirational.  for a start, i used to see mike at dalplex doing his work-out (while i jogged) at 8 a.m.  then i stopped seeing him there and thought he quit.  no such thing -- he started going at 7 instead and finally at 6 a.m.  not only that, he's great at school, a better graduate student than i am (and he's an undergrad!), physically active (besides the gym), and even has a creative outlet!  my sister and i found all this be really amazing and impressive!  she doesn't think it's sustainable but i've been getting up at 6 a.m. every morning (and correspondingly going to sleep at 11 p.m.) and otherwise drawing on every bit of motivation there is in me (more on that later).  i'd rather be  morning person  and be up when it's light outside  and  everyone is still asleep.  but sometimes it's very useful to be able to stay awake really late at night because "everyone does it."  hmm, i'm starting to babble but today looks like it's going to be an exciting day so i'll just write later....

        "a different ring tone for each boyfriend.... how very naughty!"    i got me a new phone.  two years with my trusty old silver nokia 6185i that underwent so many "soup-up" operations and was i glad to turn it in (to an unfortunate motorola-toting parent) for my very chrome, very small audiovox 8500.  feels a bit like a step down and i should have gotten a newer nokia but i'm passionately an  urlLink mtt mobility  customer and my options for phones are limited but not too limited to include my new phone.  .... what doesn't this phone do??  it's got seven colours of backlighting (of course my personal setting is purple but if my parents call, it will blink in red - lucky chinese colour and all), polyphonic ring tones and lots of "classical" ring tones to choose from, no games (i don't play 'em anyways... well, i guess i  would  play race car driving - like a demon - if i got the motorola....  but i'm not a snakes freak).  a stopwatch should i want to run or something with my phone and an alarm clock i can set to go off daily (at 6 a.m., set to a tune called "wake-up trumpet").  finally i can store everyone's three phone numbers under one named heading instead of under separate headings.  and the brilliant features of  sms  and web browsing (check email by phone!) are available should i need it (like when i'm staying with grandparents in t.!).   and  i finally have a real loop behind the phone through which i can thread one of those oh-so trendy  puca  phone-strap-ma-bobs with a sensor so not only will my phone cover flash for an incoming call but also a little puca decal as well!  :p  (nokia only provided the microphone loop which wasn't meant for threading through phone-strap-ma-bobs at all.)  a year or so ago, i saw an  lg  cell phone advertisement in a women's magazine.  it showed an animation of a slick and sly-looking girl and read something like:  "a different ring tone for each boyfriend....  how very naughty!"   yes!!  especially with my nokia it was deadly easy to give everyone a different ring tone.  it requires more steps with the audiovox :( and i couldn't give all the people i wanted ring tones.  ironic how i can find a ring tone that is so  appropo  for a certain person but they never get to hear my choice for them!

          yummy sushi!   yesterday eugene and i went to  dharma sushi  for lunch.  it is a little spot on trendy eating street argyle that i haven't been to in years upon years so it was like a new spot for me.  and, boy, was i glad to have gone.  it's summer and it's halifax so add dharma onto the list of unlikely-places-to-have-a-patio-that-has-a-patio.  i opted to sit indoors because the two more desirable patio seats were already occupied... but it was a bit stuffy inside - no air conditioning.  they have fabulously-priced lunch specials there (6.95) that change each day of the week (but are set for the day of the week so you know when you want to go for lunch :&nbsp;p).  yesterday's special was... well, i can't remember because i don't usually consider the box lunches.  i ordered tempura udon (4.95) and spicy chopped scallop maki (6 pcs. 4.50).  eugene had vegetable soba (4.50) and spicy tuna maki (6 pcs. 4.50).  tea for two was free :&nbsp;) ( "meen cha" ).  i liked right away how there are small and large sizes of noodles (like at  urlLink hamachi house  and unlike  urlLink sushi shige ) - it's a sign amongst many that the restaurant isn't out to gauge your pocket.  the scallop maki was silkily heavenly delicious.  i've never had it before except now i'm a scallop fan for at least a while.  it had a nice touch in that the scallop was rolled with roe (the really small kind that goes poppity-pop in your mouth), cucumbers, and the spicy sauce inside.  we were also presented with a dish of spicy sauce and the blandest wasabi ever made.  no wonder eugene used like all of his wasabi with nary but two drops of soya sauce!  i was slighly disappointed that the udon wasn't the fat noodles (i'll remember that) but it came with plenty of vegetables and seaweed and four pieces of tempura swimming in it (sweet potato, zucchini, green pepper, and shrimp).  the vegetable soba contained broccoli amongst the green stuff (spinach-like but i'm at a loss for which vegetable by name) and seaweed.  apparently the house special there is something called the "dynamite roll" - shrimp tempura maki (6 pcs. 6.50).  i saw one being served and it looked yummy!  i'll definitely be back again for that.  otherwise, it was a bit too warm to admire the settings - a mix between traditional japanese decor (chairs were high and uncomfortable) and an airy and bright room.  the dining room has a little more than 10 tables with four more on the patio.  dharma sushi address: 1576 argyle street hours of operation: lunch hours mon-fri. and dinner hours mon-sat.  ***** after the fact *****  urlLink click  for review of august 22, 2003 visit *************************

        trust   guys run away in fear when you talk to them about "commitment."  for me, it's when someone says to me, "i trust you."  well, i used to panic and whine about how that is  so  not a good idea.  oh well, that is just the  old wyn .  the  new wyn  feels that she may have done stupid and unreliable stuff in the past but she knows (thanks to paul) that trying  really  hard and having great intentions inside should give you as much credit amongst naysayers as people who actually do trust.  that's all i try to do is to listen really hard and figure out what people are saying between the words to listen further.  if i really care, i try to understand it so that i can talk about it, too, but if i can't or don't understand it yet, the only thing i can think of doing is to handle the trust as best as i feel is possible - like a delicate explosive.  and then what else do you do to be trustworthy?  i just try to be available for someone to talk to.  but that also means that when i'm all tied up with other things (as my procrastinating self tends to do), i feel like i'm really letting someone down.  that is my little philosophical insight for the day!  :)

        jonah day at work   yesterday, i was so excited to go out that i barely wanted to work.  since i am taking today off (dragonboat practice and then a thank-you party for vietnamese association volunteers for multicultural), i had to work alone yesterday so k would agree to work alone today.  for some reason (i hope it's just the heat), i can barely handle being at work.  and the hardest part that is constantly testing my mettle is suppressing the constant urge to whine about being bored and tired.  i  can't  be bored because i don't actually have the face the restaurant as long as my mother or certain my father does.  i don't even have to think of it on monday through thursday.  i also can't be tired because i don't work as long hours as they do nor do i have to suffer the entire time in the kitchen - the dining area is very comfortably air-conditioned.  for what waitress isn't this true: tips are the lifeline.  sometimes i fear that i walk around with dollar signs for eyes and that it shows.  i'm afraid that unless i actually know a customer to like them, everyone else is just the source for more pocket change.  i hope this attitude doesn't translate in somehow worse service - i don't think it usually does.  yesterday it was so warm that the bar fridge didn't work.  warm pop is okay because it's served on ice but beer that wasn't chilled as normal... that was simply a pain and i was constantly terrified someone would simply return a beer for not being properly chilled.  mum and i were really working against each other because was have "philosophical" battles on how to serve people.  she was all bent up serving a table with regular customers and coincidentally a patron who couldn't understand how to read (extended) instructions on an interac pinpad was causing all of our operations to get backed up.  we overlooked a table for taking their order (i think they had less patience than some other people would have) and they notified us to our oversight and left.  i  really do hope  they will return and we won't screw up again!  finally, an old,  old  woman with decided smoker's voice was really nasty to me: she croaked to me from across the room in a very nasty manner, "little gurrrl!"  (if you had seen her, you would have seen that she's only two-thirds of my height.)  "if you don't see to getting some food here in five minutes, we're leaving!"  whoops.  i can't empathize with old people so i just try to treat them with as much respect as i feel is merited based on how they treat me back.  but some old people drive me up a wall with their demands and crankiness and arrogance!   that  is why i was so excited to go out after work!

        legally blonde 2    went to see the movie on opening day (july 2).  what a piece of fluff!  i had this really disappointed feeling during the movie (like many sequels out recently) of recalling that the first incarnation of the movie was so  fresh  and the current incarnation  wasn't .  it had some laughs but i remembered laughing more genuinely in the during the first movie....     symposium (for lunch, not dessert)   on thursday, sam and i tried out  symposium  in the courtyard of the mtt building at spring garden and barrington.  he wanted to go there for longer than i did and i'd have to admit i was only really intrigued when i drove by there on saturday night and the courtyard was so prettily lit up.  so, it's a little restaurant / bar with a courtyard (patio) bit generously sprinkled with trees (that's what makes it so nice).  there is also an indoor dining restaurant which opens into the mtt "mall" that was like an indoor courtyard.  go figure, when we paid, i realized that we were paying  pacifico  which is a club located one floor below us that looks like an indoor courtyard....  outside, there is a little, colourful kiosk used as a serving station and many tables in the large space all with brightly decorated vinyl tableclothes.  it was kind of jazzy in feel.  but no sooner did we sit down did we realize that it was not a good idea that day (or any other day?) to sit outdoors.  mtt is a tall building (15 floors or so) and the courtyard happens to be in a wind tunnel between the mtt building and the church next door.  the entire time tree debris was swirling around around and i kept thinking my straw was going to fly away and hit the people sitting next to me....  i ordered iced tea (2.25) and roast beef & mushroom melt (8.00).  sam ordered pan-fried filets of haddock (10.75).  with both of our meals we could get sweet potato fries, regular fries, rice, or potato and we both opted for sweet potato fries.  the rest of the menu was... boring.  very typical restaurant/bar fare with your standard selection of sandwiches, burgers, pastas, pizzas, and appetizers.  (i would learn later upon perusing the indoor menu that the indoor restaurant has the same items available and a much more expansive selection of steaks and seafood.  bordering on impressive selection of seafood, even, for a non-seafood restaurant).  the portions were generous in my opinion (or i haven't been thrilled for the past two weeks) because i couldn't finish it.  they also gave me a scoop of colourful homemade coleslaw that was refreshing - it was barely recognizable as coleslaw except by taste consisting of carrots, cucumbers, and onions.  the haddock was a long and wide filet that not only came with fries by a portion of steamed vegetables as well - nice.  as for taste, i didn't rock my world.  maybe another (fancier) dish would have....  address: 1505 barrington street

        reasons to love home   when we were in sydney, mum said, "look at this place, makes you glad what halifax has to offer, doesn't it?"  well, yes, considering sydney has  nothing  i'm really glad that halifax has  something .  i realize that i might be a *bit* too harsh because we only drove through that little city and didn't spend enough time around to understand it but i kinda like hali in its own way.  like, this morning, i can *drive* and get to work in  half an hour , get a  parking spot  and be set for the day.  i'll be realistic - if you have to bus from where i live, you certainly won't love the city at all.  and where i am right now (tupper, the university's medical and life science building) is just plain cool.  i'd rather not work "downtown", because it doesn't hold a candle to a bigger city so i'd rather be here, with  tree-lined university ave.  just outside my window (and 8 stories down).  because this building is full of academia and research labs, i suspect there is more  intellectual activity  going on here than in the glassy xerox building on the wharf.  the hospitals are just next door and i should be able to see the heliport from some angle on this floor - cool.  :)  on one side, i can see the tree tops of point pleasant park and the arm that leads to the ocean and beyond.  on the other side, we're a stone's throw away from public gardens (pretty), my old school (sacred heart), and spring garden road (the hippest street in halifax and the atlantic provinces, i'm sure).  this is the kind of stuff i'm going to miss about hali when i'm gone....

        lock family vacation   yesterday we embarked, did, and concluded our family road trip.  we went to  cape breton .  mum initially suggested going to new brunswick and seeing the hopewell rocks again (two years ago we went during high tide) but we haven't been to cape breton in even longer so we decided to go there instead.  on the bright side - k's and my driving has improved from the intense driving we did.  we set out early in the morning on our primarily-driving trip.  we drove past truro and slowed down in the town of  new glasgow .  you see, we saw a tim horton's from the highway but we couldn't find it when we actually drove in.  we are such  city slickers  and narrow-minded that we will not venture far and have other coffee than reliable ole timmy's!  i pointed to a squat corporate (green glass windows) building with the  sobeys  logo and commented how they had really nice sobeys out in ng.  turns out stellarton is where the sobeys hq is.  so i pointed out yet another massive building sporting a sobeys logo - their distribution center.  all we get in halifax are retail stores.... :(  otherwise, we noted the nice and quaint little "welcome to new glasgow" sign and drove off.  we stopped again in  antigonish  because the tim horton's there was easy to find.  k observed how  all  the girls entering the store looked very similar: wearing a trendy fleece or "velour" track jacket in some girly colour or a baby tee or tank top paired with low-riding (read: skin-baring) track pants wtih some lame message pasted to their rear.  they all had their hair in "updoes."  we left quickly to avoid being sucked into this freaky mentality of group-dressing.  before leaving antigonish, mum directed us to seek out  st. fx .  that was not the least bit difficult to do because we first came across the charlie keating millennium centre and from there we could see the homogenous stately buildings that define st. fx campus.  we drove around and admired the uniformly stately (small) campus that contrasts so much from the old-and-new mixture of architecture you see at dalhousie.  we would pass through antigonish again at night and find that there are two churches at the edge of the campus upon hills.  when the spotlights shone upon them it reminded me of  parc mont-royal  and some other place in toronto that i cannot presently remember the name of.  very inspiring - wish that dalhousie had something so imposing... but it doesn't.  i drove the stretch between antigonish and louisbourg where we would see the most awesome two sights of the day (in my opinion):  (1) a road cut into the valley between two very densely covered mountains.  i was greatly impressed by the height of the mountains on either side of us, the curve in the road, and the lushness of the dense growth of trees.  i felt like we were a modern-day intrusion and once upon a time in  lord of the rings  time there lay a rocky path through where we were driving. (2) a high-rising bluff at  canso causeway .  as we drove towards canso causeway, we were driving towards another lush green mountain that grew more imposing as we drove near it and as we crossed the causeway, i looked back and was even more impressed by what i saw.  there were great mounds of coal (or something) and in their backdrop was a high bluff - the raggedness of the earth and how tall the bluff was was even more impressive than the green side of the mountain.  i concluded that i must be really jaded: i'll admire an innovative modern building but get used to it but i'm sure there are much more wonderous sights than what i just described yet shook this  city girl's  core.  in  louisbourg  we were pleased to learn that they waived the price of tickets because we were visiting on canada day.  (regularly, the prices would be adult 17+ 13.50, youth 6-16 6.75, and family / group 33.75.)  since i cannot recall my last official tour of the halifax citadel (if i ever even had one), it was kinda nice to explore the fortress.  i'm not sure mum knew that the tour guides were not only dressed in traditional costume but were assuming character so it was awfully funny to hear her asking them questions and honestly not understanding their answer in the context of their character!  we spent about two and a half hours there (and that was rushing things).  i'll post an alert when pictures become available!  :)  daddy drove the leg between louisbourg and  north sydney .  you see, we thought "downtown" was located in north sydney but it was easily proven wrong as we drove along commercial street and it wasn't a city center.  in fact, it reminded me a lot of the commerical section of gottingen street (spooky, ghost-towny) in halifax so we left in a hurry!  like the way dartmouth is connected to halifax if you drive through bedford, north sydney is connected to  sydney .  we first drove along esplanade and admired the long stretch of waterfront, the proximity to a large docked cruise ship, and the bounty of hotels, motels, and inns along the waterfront.  then we drove around charlotte street, king road, and prince road to see what more sydney has to offer (not much).  on prince road, daddy and i played a  spy mission : to obtain a take-out menu and as much information about the chinese restaurant, huang's, as possible.  since no one greeted us at the door (or the other people lined up for dining in), we observed to our leisure and reported back in the van parked outside.  we decided to eat at the  highland mermaid , a seafood restaurant inside the delta sydney on esplanade.  k and i had worked our imaginations into very large appetites for an all-seafood dinner and highland seemed prepared to give us exactly that  except  it was full and the snotty and condescending maitre d' told us it would be an hour to 90 minutes for a table.  by that time it would be near their stated closing time so we dejectedly gave up on the idea.  i was really offended because i'm sure some part of the snottiness had to do with our ragged casual wear (we wonder if our ethnicity would have anything to do with it either??) and it was really intolerable to us to encounter such an attitude from possibly the nicest restaurant in all of sydney.  little did they know that our appetite for seafood (and in general by that point) was so large we would have been quite large (if only one-time) patrons....     very dejected , we went to  huang's restaurant  because any other pub was too risky for getting mediocre food.  at least we could say we were "investigating" at a chinese restaurant.  as soon as we sat down, we ordered egg rolls (0.99 each), spring rolls (1.75 each), and "steak on a stick" (6 pcs. for 6.95).  after very slow deliberation, we added to our order dragon pheonix nest (11.95), mandarin shrimp (13.25), and singapore noodles (12.95).  we were one of the annoying tables that didn't order anything to drink but then there isn't anything really right to order with chinese food other than chinese tea or chinese beer.  "steak on a stick" was skinny strips of beef stretched along the length of a skewer - it had nothing but a beef-taste - no marinade or seasoning.  the egg rolls consisted of cabbage and pork (like ours) slightly spiced with pepper.  it was decent.  k cut open a spring roll for me and her to share.  for no reason in particular, i sniffed it before eating and it smelled kind of rank.  i could only nibble at it and not finish my half.  i think the ingredients were carrots, pork, and some green vegetable (peas?) all mushily mashed together.  (cont'd next post)

       (cont'd from above post)  dinner did not fare too much better.  pheonix nest consists of chicken, bbq pork, shrimps, and scallops stir-fried with broccoli, carrots, baby corn, water chestnuts, and onions, and served in a deep-fried shredded potato basket.  the white sauce from the stirfry was nothing thrilling, the shrimp was undercooked and tasted  very fresh from the ocean , and one bite of broccoli stalk revealed that it had gone bad.  the singapore noodles were made with egg noodles which seems blasphemous to me because i'm used to a rice vermicelli that soaks up the curry taste.  with egg noodles, there was a battle between the noodle flavour and curry and neither won.  otherwise, it was kind of okay, except i couldn't find any of the shrimp that was supposed to be in it.  the mandarin shrimp was a stirfry with shrimps, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, bamboo shoots, and onions, with a slightly chilli sauce.  it's saving feature was the chilli sauce and the fact that the broccoli had not gone bad.  to their credit, none of the food was too greasy or anything.  but as we were leaving, we passed by a table having sweet & sour chicken - i'll never forget their neon red sauce!  while we were deliberating what to order, i could not help but notice some similarities between menu layout, description of dishes, and names of dishes between our restaurant and huang's.  there is a possibility that they picked up our menu (and others in halifax) for inspiration - and it is frustrating that we cannot then claim things as our own!  it is also possible that great minds simply think alike.  :p  to wash it all down, we went to a dairy queen  grill & chill , a concept restaurant that hasn't yet arrived in halifax.  nothing special - just more hot food than what dq usually offers.  and then we headed for  home sweet home .

        marital bliss....  and thoughts of my own   yesterday i attended a wedding as chris' date for the marriage ceremony and celebration of two of his superior officers.  the ceremony took place at the  parish of st. george  on brunswick street.  it is a round-shaped church that suffered an enormous fire several years ago and has since then been restored.  it was really nice to have an opportunity to go inside.  the ceremony was beautiful by all accounts but the wheels in my head were turning wondering if i want one so formal... or religious.  i'm not even christian so i don't even know what that means....  the reception was held at the  armdale yacht club  which we learned was on purcell's cove road, not too far from the rotary.  yet another place i never would have been to otherwise.  the stepfather of the bride gave a funny speech making me hope that i can find someone who can give an adequately moving one toasting  me  someday....  any volunteers?  :p  the dinner was buffet style and my sin for the evening was dipping into sangria (very sweet) that was complimentary (i had one wine glass only).  they had a live band play tunes from the 60's, 70's, and 80's that i thought was a nicer touch than hiring a dj.  after we listened to the band for a bit, we hung out on the patio and chris got caught up with colleagues he hasn't seen all summer break.  it was cool to hang out on the patio because we could see the other boat clubs' lights (the waeg, st. mary's) across the arm and one of them was also have a loud party.  normal summer (northwest) arm happenings that i'm glad to have experienced.  i don't throw parties for myself.  i don't have parties thrown for me.  so i'm kind of unsure about the idea of having a party / day-long celebration for my bliss where me and the lucky-guy are the center of attention.  when there is definitely a lucky-guy  and  some more time has elapsed for me to grow up, maybe i'll feel more prepared for the whole idea of having a party for my (our) selves.  in which case, i want really nice rings to "mark" me as  unavailable , sunny day, garden ceremony, a really nice and big white dress, and a super nice traditional dress for the reception.  :)

          macaskills for lunch   thursday i decided to stay at home because i had to work in the evening, was going to program anyway and i can do that at home.  mum took that as a sign i was taking a "day off," and asked me (but didn't give me a choice) if i would join her and k for lunch since it is the waning days of summer vacation and we  never  go out the three of us for lunch (uhm... last friday at dharma....?)  the place she choose, and i'm so glad for it, was  MacAskill's .  at first i balked because it's a "nice" place.  i mean, it's an upstairs dining room with white tableclothes and matching cloth napkins.  it is candlelit at night and truly fancy dinners go on there.  lunch is, apparently, an entirely different beast, and surprisingly really affordable.  getting ahead of myself here....  the restaurant has its own elevator carrying you from the everyday ordinary of the ferry terminal and an aging public library to the  fine dining  atmosphere it is.  it is a sad old elevator so if you go, brace yourself for the jolt at the end of the ride - i didn't and felt my (bad) kneecap crack against itself if you can believe that....  i like how it is just classic kind of elegant - not  deco , not modern, but at the same time, i remembered it with more brass and crass but instead there is a few marine momentos but mostly (in the day) you notice the brilliant scenery that is the halifax skyline, the sparkling harbour, and the perpetual ferry crossing that you can see from the dining room.  (compare and contrast scenery.  from macaskill's you have a view of the navy dockyard, casino, nearly all of the halifax skyline, and the citadel hill peak peeking from behind it all.  there is a pretty little park just outside the ferry terminal since the dartmouth harbourfront is the most touristy part of the city.  if you wanted to, you can hop onto the ferry and jet to halifax in ten minutes.  from 44 north on the halifax side, you have a brilliant view... of dartmouth with a non-existent skyline.  in fact, you look at the expanse that used to be thriving cfb shearwater but now looks like a dustfield.  so there is an upside to being on the  darkside  - we get a better view.)  the prices were refreshingly low.  we ordered calamari "salsa" (5.95),  cajun chicken pasta for k (9.95), a seafood treasure for mum (9.95) and a quiche of the day (turkey & mushroom) with side spinach (7.95+1.00).  we were served bread (mmmm) that was like croissant buns and a dish of whipped butter.  the calamari looked sadly defrosted and fried from a frozen food provider but that is the case with all calamari, no?  the salsa was served in a nacho bowl that we dipped into.  not bad, but not really original, but not complaints either.  mum's seafood treasure included pieces of scallop, shrimp, and a big slice of fish all stir-fried in a creamy pesto sauce.  i had a piece of shrimp and it was really good - crunchy and fresh - while she was raving about the fish (haddock) and how smooth it was.  the seafood was served over rice pilaf with delicate vegetables (including cherry tomatoes) on the side.  she's usually never impressed with her seafood at a restaurant so this was a pleasant surprise.  i didn't find k's cajun chicken to be too spicy - it was creamy in a blush sauce with flat sheets of pasta that curled into what looked like long macaroni.  my quiche was delicious - cheesy and yummy - my only complaint would be a lack of egg since there was so much turkey.  the spinach salad was a bit funny for the dressing, oh well.  they have a fabulous lunch menu.  the settings are comfortable and gorgeous in a non-offensive elegance.  the service is a little inconsistent but oh well!  that's not what we are going there for at all.  location: 88 alderney drive hours: mon.-fri. lunch time until 2:00 p.m. & mon.-sat. dinner time

         urlLink f5  for aug.29.2003      are you going to school this year?   i get this question a lot from customers because i still look twenty or twenty-one.  so they are asking me with the expected answer that i'm either just starting university or going into second/third/fourth year.  sometimes i say that i'm going into my "fifth" year.  i guess i would say i'm going into my "sixth" year because, frankly, they aren't asking as if they really care to know that i'm in the research portion of my master's.  i  go to school  but not in the traditional sense of attending lectures.  i go to lab everyday because that's the only place where i can work and get work done.   if yes, where are you going (high school, college, etc.)? if no, when did you graduate?   graduate hs in '95, my first degree in '02, and my second one will be next year!   what are/were your favorite school subjects?   easy - math, biology, and chemistry.   what are/were your least favorite school subjects?   history, by far.  because i switched schools, i unfortunately had to endure three years of canadian history (two at one school, one at the other), followed by a year of american history and "world" history.  i don't know anything about ancient times.  i just live in the present.   have you ever had a favorite teacher? why was he/she a favorite?   my french teacher from grades three through 6, mme. wilson.  back then, she was so elegant and beautiful (i  am  deep-seated shallow) - in retrospect bottled-blonde bigtime - compared to my other more down-to-earth teachers.  not only that, she was a really good french teacher - strict while being kind and a good teacher of french.

       note: last night chris made spaghetti that was  far  yummier than that at  urlLink ardmore  or anywhere else for that matter!   the grass is greener....   when i'm doing assignments, i just want to be reading. when i'm reading for some inane course, i just want to be doing my own research. when i'm doing my research, i want to be outdoors or doing something else. ....in fact, after five days of not working at the restaurant, i insanely looked forward to actually working as a waitress (brainless money, and justification for dressing well).   check your bills very carefully   it costs $30 for 150 minutes of daytime cellular minutes?!  it used to cost me only $10.  when did  urlLink aliant  up the prices and i'm screwed for the next 23 months of my contract if it's the rate i signed up for.  .... they call people like me  dai tao ha  (literally, "big headed shrimp").    it turns out that i've been charged $20 extra a month for the past 8 months....  and i thought my bills were always "honest."  i also overlooked the $20 because i routinely use more than the 150 minutes anyways so i thought i was being nailed appropriately for it.  all the money is being credited back to me.  and people like me should not be in charge of finances.  i was close to considering switching my service to  urlLink rogers .  (no!!!!  crappy service!!!!)

        down-to-earth   after a leisurely stroll (like an old married couple) in the quinpool/oxford area on account of chris' injured hamstring, we did a very old-married-couple thing and dined at the   ardmore tea room  .  where have i heard of that place before?  oh yes, it won  the coast's  award for "best diner / greasy spoon" if not this year but last year or the year before.  needless to say, it's a popular diner and greasy spoon place.  well, since i like brand names on my food (but not my clothes), i'm for a new and unknown place if it is heralded by at least some authority for some aspect.  chris said they are famous (at least well-known) for their spaghetti so he ordered one for himself (4.50 for just spaghetti and garlic bread, 6.50 for the meal they assumed he did not want).  in the spirit of being in an old-person's place, i did an old-person thing and ordered liver & onions (5.55 for just liver, and 6.99 for the meal).  boy, i felt like an old man - the only people i've ever seen order liver & onions at my restaurant!  the spaghetti portion was not the generous one i imagined a down-home diner would give.  it was good (a bit reluctant i am about too much praise - it was homemade for sure).  my liver was on the super-well-done side to the point of being charred and onions were chopped and charred, not sliced and grilled.  mushrooms cost .50 extra.  opted not to have gravy - maybe that was a mistake.  mashed potatoes okay and the vegetables were steamed from a frozen bag.  chris said the place reminded him of  midtown tavern  and it felt to me like  spartan restaurant  or  the greek house .  you know, really diner like with the faux-wood vinyl table in booths with vinyl swirly cushion seats,  el cheapo  cutlery, "glassware," and all that.  i'm not really a diner kinda girl, and hopefully not when i get old and gray either.  however, if you are looking for a place to do some reading or work, in a place with zero pretensions and that won't kick you out for soliciting, you can go to a place like ardmore and get it done.  location: 6499 quinpool road

        been out and about   nothing too exciting, i suppose.  but i'll blog it lest you think i've stopped dining out or something....!  i haven't!  :p    sushi & noodles    a little fast food counter in the food court of martime building at the corner of spring garden and barrington.  two authentically chinese people vouched for the place so we decided to give it a try several weeks ago (august 6).  i ordered the spicy seafood stew (6.95 or 7.95) while chris ordered a korean combination (6.95) consisting of steamed rice, stewed korean chicken, and "sweet & sour" korean chicken.  they made my stew with scallops instead of mussels as originally intended because they had run out of mussels and i'm glad they did.  aside from scallops, they also prepared julienned vegetables (i can't remember so much by now!), and chewy (good!) pieces of octopus.  i can hardly remember the noodles but it was a suitably yummy bowl of noodles in a typical korean spicy broth.  i liked the stewed chicken quite a bit but not so much the "sweet & sour" chicken.  they also serve sushi and other japanese noodles that i didn't try but wouldn't mind in a future visit!  the noodles are sure to be good but the sushi....?  anyone's guess.  ***** click  urlLink here  for another review from sept. 19, 2003 click  urlLink here  for another review from oct 20, 2003    curry village    tried to go for spaghetti at your father's mustache last monday (august 18) but they were closed for a staff meeting so we went around the corner for some long-anticipated indian food at  urlLink curry village .  i was immediately hungry when we entered - it's like a psychological thing and we ordered without too much delay two dishes of chris' choosing, beef madras (8.95) and lamb dupiaza (12.95), and my choosing - samosas (2 pcs., 4.95).  thought i could handle the madras since i  nearly  died last time with vindaloo even with the aid of two containers of yoghurt.  and i had madras with shafyn and safa and it was okay but the cook made it spicy and all sorts of lassi did not quell entirely the flames.  it was good - i don't usually order beef curry - usually i would get chicken and lamb to be really wild.  the lamb dish looked a whole lot like a chinese dish with many triangles of green peppers and really grilled-to-burnt onion triangles in a gray sauce.  it was really gray!  the saving grace and thing that made it novel was the lamb meat - it was yummy!    dharma sushi    on friday (august 22), i took a  really  short day at work and went to  urlLink dharma sushi  for lunch with k and mum.  i ordered my usual: small tempura udon (4.95) and salmon maki (6 pcs., 4.50).  k orded a large beef udon (8.50) and spicy scallop maki (6 pcs., 4.50).  mum ordered a chicken teriyaki lunch special (5.95).  my tempura udon was good (as could be expected).  they serve the tempura in the soup that mum disfavours because it gets soggy.  i got a piece each of shrimp, green pepper, sweet potato, and zuchinni.  and this time i got the flatter udon noodles.  the salmon maki wasn't the most pleasing - the pieces of salmon were very ungenerous and they were also not a very attractive orange colour.  in fact, they looked kind of sick for a fish.  k's udon was not twice the size of mine but she figures that she did get quite a bit more noodles and vegetables for the doubling of the price.  the scallop maki was better - again with the little crunchy roe and cucumbers.  it was really nice and spicy.  mum's teriyaki reminded me of why i don't order it because in my opinion, it loses some of it's "teriyaki" distinctiveness at most restaurants - she received a piece of dark meat chicken with some sweet sauce paste over it and some sesame seeds sprinkled over it.  it was served over rice with a considerable side of salad with ginger dressing.  it was certainly (unfortunately) better the other time i was there.    frans'    i didn't go to  urlLink fran's  but mum and k did a week or so ago and ordered two of their lunch-time specials.  one consisted of rice, 2 (mini) spring rolls, black bean chicken, and ribs.  i'm not going to delve into how mortified they were with the lack of authenticity of that dish.  another lunch-time special offered was my favourite noodle dish (of my many favourites) that is  dan dan meen .  and that was terrible butched to hear them talk about it.  they used shanghai noodles when they should have used a skinnier noodle but that is hardly the most offensive because there was also nothing to make it  dan dan  - neither the peanut paste and hardly the spiciness.  grr - that's what you get here where people can get away with such bad imitations of the real thing.  i can't cook and i can make better  dan dan meen ....

        the meds are coming   the link of the tupper (medical / medical sciences building) is awashed in colour because it is med frosh week, presumably.  this year's theme is one "club med" because, perhaps, it has been a really cold summer.  my yearly ritual since i have been at dalhousie, then, is to post myself in front of the bulletin board and peruse the med 1's list to see who i know who has just joined the medical school ranks.  sure, it's been a few years since i should have graduated ('99) and getting to be a year since i graduated ('02), but i can still identify an alarming number of names, and these are just people at dalhousie med.  people i studied with: hs archrival andrew b., hs archrival irene, elementary school buddy jill, vball whiz lisa, fellow chemmies robyn and terran, fellow biochemmies ed, erin, and "redhead" (i never knew his name), o-chem classmate dolly, fellow shsh-er alene, fellow grammar schoolmate fiona,....  not to mention others who went to different med schools: my high school pal yiling, fellow chemmies elaine and mike, and my cousin sandi.  i won't even mention all the others who aspire(d) to be meds who have either moved on with their lives or are still working through their bachelor or masters degrees hoping that next year will bring an acceptance letter.  why am i getting worked up about this?  cuz once upon a time the idea was (put) in(to) my head to be a doctor.  i always had more of an inclination (than, say, my sister) towards biology, chemistry, the way the body works, and stuff.  but the only path that was supposed to lead to according to the driving force of my life (my mother), was to be a doctor.  no way, no how was i supposed to be a nurse, dietician, physiotherapist.  maybe a pharmacist or optometrist, but those are only more recent concessions.  i even did all the extra-curricular activities in high school and volunteered in a hospital like a good little pre-pre-med.  when i was considering what university to go to, even in the middle of august 1995, i told my mum that if i stayed here, i would do a bsc with an engineering diploma and then apply to med school.  if i couldn't for the life of me get in, i would "fall back" on engineering.  and i was alright to be an engineer because, you know, i had really good marks in chemistry and physics.  (darn that biology mark.  and darn the physics teacher making things so easy you'd think you were a whiz at it.)  life is full of  what-if's .  frankly, i didn't want to stay in halifax and i didn't want to live with grandparents (for ut's engineering sciences) so i went to waterloo.  and i'm not cut out to be an engineer of any sort so i came back here and somehow ended up in biochem (search me, i can't remember all the decisions right now).  staying here right after my high school i wouldn't have gotten off the  med-track  - though i would have been just as miserable while taking statics and thermo and the like.  biochem and bio - now there's a breeding ground for aspiring med's and i balked against it but i also didn't know what i wanted to do.  right after graduation, i could have looked for a job (that i could have been an nmr spectrometrist at nrc is still consolation to me, amongst other jobs bio/chemmie classmates are now working) or - worst case - toiled as a biochemmie lab tech.  but i decided to do my masters - some more of that home-programming - and had the choice of biochem (but who knows if i would have been accepted because i'm terrible at it, just interested), cs (good at it), or this strange new program with no prereqs, health informatics.  ultimately, i learned that i want to do something i'm both good at and interested in, which, in a long-winded way, justifies what i have chosen, even if that means the future is a bit hazy still.  i don't know exactly what i will be doing or where i will be in a year.

         urlLink f5  for aug.22.03      when was the last time you laughed?   a few minutes ago.  k told me about how a friend of a friend got really sick after two drinks prompting our poking fun at our mum who fancies herself to be completely plastered after one glass of wine and acts out.  :p   who was the last person you had an argument with?   my sister.  she was running late and wasn't pleased to have to give me a lift while she was late already.   who was the last person you emailed?   my cousin warren in london.  i'm trying to figure out when he will return for his infrequent visits and when i should go to toronto in the fall.  he is away on vacation and i got his autoreply.   when was the last time you bathed?   last night.  to wash off dirt from the (hfx) commons acquired while  attempting  to play ultimate.  (been there, done that, never again....)   what was the last thing you ate?   breakfast: all-bran cereal and a banana.  :)

        don't wanna join the  urlLink dead thesis society    on the odd sunny day, i want to be outside, strolling, or at least in a mall with the occasional glimpse of sun, or having lunch  al fresco  at a restaurant (patio) downtown.   not  "cooped" up and gazing out from the eighth floor through dirty windows such that every day seems hazy or cloudy.  mum doesn't even have to guilt-trip me to work - i am more available in the summer to work and seemingly infinitely available now that classes are over and done with  forever .  i've been working 6 hours every night and, frankly, the boredom of work drives me up a wall and makes me unproductive before, after, and during work.  so i'm looking forward to september when school starts up again and there will be so many students (thanks in part to double cohort, blah blah blah) that i will appreciate my own space in lab that i take for granted right now.  k will be back in school and stressing out over her research as well instead of taunting me everyday....  that a strict routine will return... because it desperately needs to.  i have a propensity to all the worst habits: procrastination, fear, lack of discipline....  that's why i'm best suited for a courses-only masters, not this "motivate yourself" thing.  what keeps me going: thinking,  "i have to work if i'm going to graduate... sometime."     "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." ~ confucius ~

        good night of sleep   i want to be the kind of person who only consistently needs to sleep for five or six, tops seven, hours a day.  my sister the little neuroscientist, begs to differ, and treats her sleep like some kind of experiment and allots enough time each night for her favourite number of sleep cycles.  so, when i was really beady-eyed on saturday (got home at 4, woke up at nine), she insisted on creating a good sleep environment for me that night down to turning my mirror into the wall to eliminate reflections, turning off the oscillating fan, covering those darned led's on my recharging devices (laptop and cell phone) because those darn things are  really  bright, diminishing as much as possible light from outdoors, turning off my alarm clocks, and wrapping my analog alarm clock in a cloth to dampen the sound of the moving second hand.  besides waking once in the middle of the night (wanted to find out what time it was but kept in the spirit of trying to get good sleep and didn't turn on lights to find out) and once maybe around five or six in the morning, i let myself sleep until i woke up not feeling tired at around 9 a.m.  well rested?  i'm not sure, i felt dozy anyways at some points during the day.  :p  on sunday, when i called chris after work (around 11:30 p.m.), he was feeling extremely under the weather.  it took about half an hour of debating with myself whether or not to "zip" (twenty minutes at 80 kph) across town to tend to him because he sounded soooo miserable.  i finally decided that continuing talking on the phone was pretty lame and probably not doing much for him.  so i did zip over and administered pain-reducing drugs, oreo cookies :) and tlc... well, the best version of tlc that wyn can provide as i'm pretty useless, actually, and will rely very heavily on a medical desktop reference that i do not yet own when i have little kids with little ailments.  :p  at least he good a really good night's sleep.  :)

        power out   it's no  urlLink news  to anyone in canada that central canada (i.e., southern ontario, including toronto, the center of the universe) is out of power as of yesterday afternoon and indefinitely.  i'm not gleeful nor am i upset.  just a little worried for relatives and other folk i know who will be severely discomforted by the lack of electricity.  but i know they are in good hands.  i'm paul's eyes and ears until further notice.  :)    urlLink f5  for aug.15.2003      how much time do you spend online each day?   the entire time i'm at work, which could be from four to seven hours, and a couple hours when i'm at home.  well, i'm not actively using the connection at all times!   what is your browser homepage set to?    urlLink msn.com  or  urlLink news.google.com  - my only link to the outside world!  :p   do you use any instant messaging programs? if so, which one(s)?   msn.  originally resisted sooo much against using microsoft's im, but it's getting cooler and cooler as we speak.   where was your first webpage located?    urlLink on chebucto freenet .  it's still there!!  but long since defunct.  i started that maybe ten years ago, i was pre-graphical internet, could you believe that?!   how long have you had your current website?   i guess is started it up again (and it was largely motivated by having a context for a blog) last year in april.

       (in backwards chronological order of the past few days)   polish   chris' mum prepared a fantastic lunch for us yesterday after the hike and i entered the family home for the first time.  it was just perfect and i'm thoroughly impressed.  i would gush but it would simply betray that (1) i haven't been to a western family dinner in, oh, seven years, maybe and (2) how sadly haphazard my family is but we have our reasons - the first one is we only ever have chinese-style meals.  basically i had to make it look like a really normal  gweilo  meal is like second nature to me.  :p  hope it was successful!   bushwhacking   oh gosh, i had  no idea  what i was signing up for when i agreed to go hiking today.  we (chris and his family and i) went out to  duncan's cove  (a mere half hour out of the city) for a hike in the morning.  lessons learned: 1. i didn't "hike" in grs. 10-12 at keji.  those were but "nature walks."  hiking is exhausting. 2. wear long pants and off! - though mosquitos climb into weird places still. 3. going uphill is easier. 4. i'm helpless at choosing hiking outfits.  thanks to k for bailing me - all the clothes i wore were hers.  ("so what is it like to be k?"   super jumper!   see below....) 5. once you get dirty once, it's not so bad to continue splashing through the mud (there was a rain shower throughout).  when we weren't whacking bushes and were actually hiking, i was  super jumper , the little-known super mario character who can lithely leap from rock to rock with the weakness only of slippery sneakers and weak ankles and characterized by the intermittent shrill shriek of delight or fear.   meet the parents   sunday, i was a nervous wreck because it was the day we set to go  yum cha  at  china classic  with chris and his family.  i was briefly introduced to his mother before but hadn't met his father yet.  i recall meeting paul's parents, the weird situation leading up to it, and how awkward and shy i was... seven whole years ago.  this was the first time i've officially set aside time to "meet the parents."  and it was great.  restaurants and  yum cha  were familiar settings for me.  food was mostly great  urlLink *   and conversation was good.  chris said that since they inquired for information from me (i.e., talked to me), they liked me.  yay. :)  monday: with significantly less notice (one week instead of two), i invited chris to have dinner at our restaurant where my parents would be present.  they didn't eat with us because they were working (as it turns out mum brought k so it was a "family affair") but my father chatted with him for a bit and mum came up, smiled, and walked away.  kind of like in  urlLink joy luck club (the movie)  where waverly's mother checks out her boyfriend but doesn't say a word, or was it lina's mother checking out her daughter's husband she did not like....?!  it was, suffice it to say, another first.  :)  food was good - naturlich. urlLink  *      *  at china classic, we ordered  gnao pack yeep  (beef tripe, good),  zuhn juu gai  (sticky rice with meat in bamboo leaves, good),  dahn tat  (egg tarts, not so great pastry), crispy-wrapped taro-shelled dumplings (really good),  fun gwo  (fried dumplings, had the same good filling as the taro-stuff), dumpling with shrimp and  big sprigs of coriander  (needless to say it was terrible!),  ha cheung fun  (shrimp rice rolls, blah),  chow mein  (fried noodles, good),  lo baht goe  (radish cake, bland),  foo jook guune  (bean curd wrapped rolls, good filling and wrap), and  cha siu bao  (steamed bun with bbq pork, bun was not fluffy enough).  at my restaurant, we ordered hk tsap gum chinesified (more  bok choy  and snow peas) with added chilli - it was difficult to serve - the darned slippery rice vermicelli kept slipping, shrimp with lobster sauce (awesome as usual), and  goo loe yook  (traditional sweet & sour pork, pretty good).

        it's better than s*x....   salmon sashimi, that is.  :p  friday night, i went on my first  double date .  chris (my date), his friend jeff, and jeff's gf, and i went to  urlLink momoya sushi bar  on barrington.  that place has all of seven tables, two of them are two-seater, so it was a great relief to not have to wait in line for a table.  that place was perpetually busy with all tables being used and people waiting at the sushi bar for a table.  we got a four-person "traditional" table sunken in and where we had to remove our shoes and sit on huge mats on the seats.  the hostess inquired if i am chinese and spoke to me in cantonese (the language of the staff there) and apparently she has picked up japanese and mandarin as well as english while working there.  i ordered tempura udon (7.80) and spicy scallop maki (6 pcs., 6.50).  chris ordered a sushi set b (16.50) and ingaru (2 pcs. tofu nigiri, 4.50).  jeff ordered tendon (tempura served on rice) and sushi set a (15.50), and rainbow maki (6 pcs., don't know how much) while his girlfriend ordered tendon and a salad.  tempura udon was good.  flat noodles (i'll have to live with that) in a sweet-ish broth.  not a lot of noodles, not a lot of vegetables (just a sprig of broccoli and some seaweed).  the side of tempura consisted of two string beans, two sweet potatoes, a zucchini, and a shrimp.  the batter was more chinese sweet & sour batter, but thin, than the light and crispy and sprinkly batter that it should have been.  spicy scallop maki was silky slippery pieces of heaven.  :)  sushi set b consisted of 6 pcs. salmon maki, 6 pcs. california roll, a piece each of salmon, red snapper, surf clam, and shrimp nigiri.  i forgot how sweet the tofu of the ingaru was.  sushi set a consisted of 6 pcs. salmon maki, 6 pcs. california roll, a piece each of salmon, tuna, red snapper, and shrimp nigiri (i think).  rainbow maki was new to me and it was rather colourful since it rolled into fat and flat maki tuna (red), salmon (orange), pickled radish (yellow), and cucumber (green).  surely it was as yummy as it looked - i mean tuna  and  salmon?!?  tendon provided many pieces of tempura (two shrimp apiece and many strips of vegetables).  for some reason, i didn't get tempura dipping sauce (mine was also served on the side) while they did....  oh well.  momoya is a "traditional" kind of japanese restaurant with the unique seating and "rice paper" walls.  i realized that the free-standing tables (with the dark wooden benches) near the door imitated a little gazebo because there is a little roof hanging overhead.  the servers get really personal with you, which i found slightly uncomfortable.  it was particularly difficult for them to reach across our table so one of the younger servers actually slid into the a seat at the table with the patrons to take their order.  oh, and the service was a bit slow.   it's better than clubbing   a bit after dinner, we went to mona's to chill before they went out.  they were playing a german board game that probably made more sense when you're getting inebriated so we shared a ben & jerry's instead.  :)  good thing saturday is a jogging day....  sometimes i'm on the outside, watching the girls become uninhibited and i can't for the life of me participate.  i think having chris there helped because we can be ourselves and forget about the girls or he and lionel get along and i can get caught up with the girls.  if the whole point of the evening was just to converge on mona's and hang out, it might not have been as fun as getting dressed and having the intention of going out and but just having an even better time at the preparation stage.  they didn't go out after all.  oh, and when we were dancing to indian and arabic music and the macarena and the ketchup song, the guys  were  watching.

        urlLink "explosion rocks halifax harbour"    first day of the rest of my life   yes, it is back to the books and after a meeting with one supervisor yesterday and the other one today, i am renewed, energized, blah, blah, blah.  i'm thrilled because i saw for the first time the importance (usefullness) of what i'm doing.  you could say that i'm looking for ways to improve multiple sequence alignment.  i'm not going to mess around with the big algorithm (probably not) but i will take its output that so many people rely on and implement two types of automated evaluation and adjustment that we currently do by eye, that the current algorithm couldn't possibly do.  sounds elusive?  yeah, well, i'm just getting started.  i love reading and i'm so nerdy at times, just need the librarian glasses to complete the look....  so, pardon me if i'm exceptionally boring from now on.  as i get further, i may try to convey my thrill about what i am doing but if for some reason that doesn't entirely get across, here is my apology in advance.

        studying means eating   no more school, no more books....  i'm pleased as punch that i'm done all of my courses and today's final is the last one i have to suffer... forever?  correction: it wasn't bad at all.  i always, always look forward to a test or exam these days that i study sufficiently for an examination.  it's like  what kind of fun and challenging questions can wyn tackle today?   call it a wynism.  :)  on sunday chris invited me to breakfast with him and his brother at    greek house .  not my usual place, you know, i didn't even know (still) where it is on quinpool rd.  (read: eating district).  breakfast can be got for very cheap there (and drinks, too).  the brothers had feta omelette (wyn scratches her head at the idea of non-cheddar omlettes) and wyn had veggie omelette, each for 4.45.  the guys said the feta omelette was not so great, that they found their usual haunt ( athens ) to serve better omelettes.  however, the big breakfast (somethink like 3 eggs, plentiful sausage, bacon,  and  ham, and fries and toast, for 4.95) is worth visiting the greek house... apparently.  the feta omelette consisted solely of feta cheese (wyn is still perplexed).  my veggie omelette consisting of green pepppers, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes, wasn't that great either.  first of all, there was no cheese (what's an omelette without  cheddar  cheese?!).  second of all, the vegetable were tossed in in huge chunks and were hence still very juicy and not grilled at all.  the omelettes were served with toast and lightly seasoned fried potatoes.  the decor is very eatery.  here's the hint: there is a cake display at the cash and in it are plates of single-servings of their pies and baklava on generic white cafeteria-esque plates, and wrapped in saran wrap.  which made me wonder how they could also woo people in for a $40 dinner for two that includes a bottle of wine, two greek entrees, and two big pieces of baklava.  turning down the lights can only do so much for creating ambience, though, but who knows?  the greek food is not supposed to be too bad there, either.  but i do believe next time, i'll leave the guys to have their male-bonding time without my intrusion.  ;)    we ordered out for dinner.  mmm,  china classic  (just around the corner, also on quinpool).  the story behind that: we were originally planning on having big family traditional chinese dinner on friday in vancouver and i was dreaming up what really tasty dishes we would have but it got unfortunately cancelled and i had been craving restaurant chinese food ever since!  we ordered beef with rice noodles with black bean sauce (8.95) - what i was craving, triple in bird's nest (10.50), and hunan beef (8.55) - chris' favourite dish.  the beef/rice noodes - mmm - was great... not oily as it tends to be and flavourful.  snowpeas, zucchinis, green peppers were all good... except for the beef.  thin square-shaped slices that were lacking in colour, flavour, and softness.  oh well.  bird's nest consists of squid, shrimp, and scallops stir-fried with snow peas, carrots, zucchini,  wun yee  ("cloud ear"), and i can't remember the rest, in a flaky pastry bowl.  it was really yummy - i approved of the freshness of the shrimp, and generally the quality of the seafood.  (reminisce of toronto restaurants... and then snap out of it.)  hunan beef was a new dish to me.  was pleasantly surprised to identify tofu bricks in there otherwise i don't recall the other vegetables present.  was also surprised that hunan sauce was sweet and slighty spicy (but not really very hot).  i liked china classic for three reasons: (1) being suitably authentic (you can tell by the chinese students who go there), (2) not having some kind of snotty attitude for being suitably authentic (i can think of a place that is), and (3) having the most acceptable  cha see  in this city ("tea service," or dim sum offering).  and i like it for an additional reason: reasonable prices.  i hadn't noticed that before.  it is quite amenable to student budgets.  after my  final  final exam for the forseeable future, i wanted to realize my craving (yet another one) for a spinach-on-spinach lunch consisting of spanikopita from  italian gourmet  with a side of spinach salad.  but i was utterly displeased when i was drenching (rainy days in halifax) and waiting for service at the "bustling" downtown cafe.  the deli/serving area is always abuzz with employees but they don't get around to noticing the customers until they have waited for a few minutes.  anyways, no spanikopita ready even at noon (wyn is displeased).  i didn't really want to get any other kind of entree (quiche, lasagna, torte, meatloaf, roasted chicken, etc.) because i was going for concocting a light lunch so i had to forgo spinach-on-spinach and picked up a "tiramisu for two" (5.99).  that was fun eating.  :)  the greek house address: 6253 quinpool road  ***** click  urlLink here  for another review of the greek house  china classic restaurant address: 6311 quinpool road  the italian gourmet address: 5431 doyle street

          mexi's   since the patio was not open a few weeks back it made me want to go to mexis' patio all the more.  so i suggested to andrew going only for eats on thursday night and at mexi's.  you see, everyone in halifax is vying for a spot on the patio of your father's mustache so we had no problems getting a seat on the narrow patio.  there were only five other tables in a line hugging the wall of the second-floor restaurant.  we got a little nook but you can still see out and down.  i was at a loss for what to order and (not surprisingly) made a rash choice.  at first i was leaning towards shrimp fajitas (usually i get chicken or beef, but shrimp sounded so juicy and good-for-you, for 15.99).  then i noticed steam tampiquena ("mexican-style steak," 15.99) and then i was also torn with having fajita-quesidilla-something (sounds like it is just one fajita already prepared for you with either chicken, beef, or shrimp and with rice or beans on the side and a salad, 11.99).  i ordered the steak because my mouth waters a the thought of juicy, medium-cooked aromatic steak....  andrew ordered a chicken caesar salad (9.99).  the steak came with a side of mexican-style rice (i presume).  it was bit dry so i put the red "salsa" over it and it was fine and good then.  it also came with a small salad (coriander alert!  not strong, but not pleasing.  i picked out the cauliflower bits to eat) and a cheese enchilada smothered in "salsa" (by salsa, i mean some kind of red, tomato-y paste).  that wasn't so good at all because i'm just not fond of gooey fried cheese or fried tortilla.  the steak was covered in "salsa," peppers, onions, and cheese.  other than that, i don't know what was so "mexican" about it....  it was also more cooked than medium.  andrew said the chicken strips on his salad were good.  the crowning moment, of course, was dessert!  we each ordered deep-fried iced cream (3.95).  you can have vanilla ice cream coated in cornflakes and chocolate/strawberry/rasberry/butterscotch and deep-fried.  we both chose chocolate and it was divine to have crunchies and chocolate and dallops of whipped cream (i ate it, too, bad girl.... :p).  the bill was larger than i was mentally expecting (25.22, i had an iced tea for 1.99) and even andrew's came to 16.00.  no cheat, but things just add up quickly there!  that could be the cost of consistency because mexi's is consistently quite good.  (i want shrimp fajitas next time!)  otherwise, it was really great to see andrew because he's leaving for next term in less than a month!!

         urlLink f5  for aug.1.2003       what time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   two weeks ago, i was on this hot streak of getting up at 6 but then needing to sleep at 11.  then vancouver happened and eot happened and now i'm down to 5 hours of sleep and getting up at 8....  grr, i want to wake up at 6!   do you sleep in on the weekends? how late?   no, i don't usually.  it makes me feel lazy and i try to avoid ways to feel as lazy as i really am!   aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   uhm... shower.  i also try to eat something for breakfast everyday.   how long does it take to get ready for your day?   45 minutes.  i think i'm low-maintenance.   when possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?    urlLink cora's  definitely!  it has the atmosphere and the food is varied and yummy!

        size matters   eeek!  according to this "real" urlLink size chart , little ole four-foot-eleven-and-a-half-inch me, i'm a  size 8 , maybe.  i haven't actually sat down and measured myself.  aren't all these measurements insane?  i feel healthy as a horse.  when i look in my full-length mirror (granted, it is tilted so the bottom juts out a little to  elongate  your form), i don't bad about myself at all.  and then i consider how the bigger people see me.  especially those towering six-foot people much bigger than me probably see me as a  lithe little being, a miniature of real life .  but the reality is that i've hit twenty-five and my metabolism, well, isn't so youthful or springy any longer.  it's really, really sad.  i've never had the metabolism my sister enjoys.  when she goes back to school, she rues because she loses weight because she is no longer active.  i would gain weight from inactivity and get soft and mooshy.  but what i did enjoy, without really knowing it was my gift, was a healthy metabolism that allowed me to enjoy the yummier and bountiful side of life and still not show it.  we ate the same amount and she ends up a size 4 (super metabolism) and i'm a size 6 (better-than-average metabolism).  but i could have not been blessed and ballooned to size 14 because that is not uncommon these days....  (i attribute it to being first generation chinese-canadian and traditional chinese cuisine at home.)  so i have to say "so long," to fast-metabolism and greet with a large amount of chagrin the  grown-up metabolism .  i've never in my life been on a diet before, never watched what i ate but things have to change.  i never thought i would become a calorie-counter.  it's awfully hard to count the calories in a home-cooked  chinese  meal such that i don't bother anyways.  when  urlLink tracy  wrote about watching her carbs, i worried about the peer pressure of anorexic hong kong people and how mindless it is to care about these details.  but when it really means something to you, the facts just stick to you and you remember the nutritional content of a food item as if there is an led blinking on the packaging.  i have an unopened bag of doritos (nacho italian, i cannot resist trying new flavours) since tuesday.  it contains at least two servings that it is so tempting to eat all at once.  that unopened bag of doritos is like my daily reminder of keeping my strength up and cravings (i have massive salt cravings) at bay.

        "when you put  bioinformatics  into the name, money starts falling from the skies at you."   that was uttered by one of my supervisors when we were at a meeting trying to deliberate what our name should be: "statistical phylogenomics" or "statistical evoluationary  bioinformatics "?  that is  not  why i'm in it.  it would be grossly unwise to get into this field with superficial knowledge of both computer science and biochemistry thinking an interdisciplinary field such as bioinformatics would be a good match.   i'm under pressure to meet with my  thesis advisory committee  (in two weeks).  that would be me with four folks each of whom know about five times more than i know about anything.  will the pressure never cease?? :(

        yeah, i knew this already....   "top tip for waiters: let customers split the bill  if your waiter grumbles when you and your friends ask to pay separately, tell them you have scientific evidence for why it is in their interest. psychologists have found that when it comes to tips, the smaller the bill, the bigger the percentage paid. leonard green and colleagues at washington university in st louis, missouri, studied 1000 gratuities at restaurants, hair salons and cab companies, and found that tips dropped as a percentage as bills went up. so a $10 bill might win a waiter a 20 per cent tip, while a $50 tab might only return 15 per cent. the fact that the tip was not a fixed percentage runs contrary to the predictions of microeconomic theory (psychonomic bulletin & review, vol 10, p 381)."  from  urlLink new scientist , 20 september, page 24  tipping is the  variable  that makes waitressing fascinating since i'm not the sort of person who makes small talk with every (or any) customer.  our food is always good and usually prompt so it's like the customer's evaluation of your performance though it's not really, really reliable.  yesterday i wasn't having a great deal of luck sinking my teeth into  the hobbit  in the later hours of my shift when we would get a small rash of customers.  two big bouncer-like guys ( big  gold and silver chains) order $90 in take-away food.  two older women come in for dinner.  a weasel-y wannabe-punk comes in with "cool" gf for dinner.  two more bouncer-types (more exposed chains) come in and feast more than the other two sets of dining in patrons.  and two more wiry gym-going guys come in for take-out orders.  i like the "late night"  siu yeh  business.  :)  anyways, the last two bouncers who dined in i may have confused while they were paying in cash but he left me a $10 tip at the cash and then another $5.  that is about  37.5% tip !  mum is a bit wary of people like that.  me, too, actually.  you wonder  what  they liked about you so much.  i learned my lesson a couple of years ago - if the customer expresses the desire to pick you up, and you've barely done anything for him, and he leaves a fabulous tip (he was like throwing $20s at me), it's a really low feeling you get.  i'm there to provide a service.  for work, i dress more like a  bartender  at my favourite  night club  than a typical waitress in the black-pants-white-shirt uniform.  i fancy it gives the restaurant a more hip image if the chinese girls serving don't look like they came straight from the village.  and it makes me feel better to look hip if a patron is especially cruddy in attitude since we can't fight back in a verbal argument.  a woman ordered last night for five people: each person got a 3-item personal combination with rice, a stirfry item, and a deep-fried item, and an egg roll (11.00 each), an extra egg roll for each person (1.50 each), and two orders (heaping) of ginger beef (11.95 each).  she squabbled and squawked while snapping her bubblegum indignantly at the grand total $101 (cursed 15% tax) and claimed to be able to order the same food  anywhere else  for $75.  pre- or post-tax.   if you say so.   so she claimed it was her first and last time ordering from us - good riddance to that.  let's see, it's a hefty combination and with an additional egg roll you'd have to roll any but a really big man out the door it leaves you so full.  and then everyone gets a serving of ginger beef, a house speciality made with immense amounts of  tlc ?  definitely $17 (pre-tax) is not asking for a lot.  some people.... :I

        i'll never be a walker   got a mad blister while jogging on monday and on wednesday, i was resigned to not jogging because i wasn't well yet.  on saturday, i went and completed 3 of five segments (~6 km) before throwing in the towel - i didn't want to get another blister that puts me out on monday.  still, i'm pretty proud of myself because it's the first time in about three months that i've gone jogging  alone, without music, outdoors .  great feat, i tell you....  the last four kilometers, i walked because i couldn't both stop jogging early and then skimp on distance covered.  boy was that intensely boring....  it was so  inefficient  and i sorely wished that i could cover that ground faster instead of being some  walker .  went to body trim class last week (that is resistance training with a "body band", read: large elastic band with handles) and plan to attend two per week.  this summer was a grand time but what i love about fall aside from the cooler weather, fall fashions, and changing colours, is the routine that returns.  i'm looking to lose ten pounds for starters.

        pass along the savings   my sister made fun of me yesterday because i was staying home for the evening after not doing so for four days (and then i was away for four days before that) and it had a large part to do with thursdays chris has his reserves job.  and she noted that i was clingy to family members because i wasn't going to see him.    ....so she can see right through me...  big deal .  :p  for a quickie lunch, we went to  urlLink sushi & noodle  in maritime mall.  looking at the pictures, chris nearly ordered something other than the seafood stew (7.95) he wanted since i had it last time but i set him on the right track.... :)  i deliberated after looking at the sushi case between that the tempura udon and settled on the latter (7.95).  while we were waiting to pay i nearly changed my mind again when i saw a man receive a maki/nigiri combo (with at least six pieces of assorted nigiri and at least six pieces of california maki) with a can of pop and a soup that totaled 9.95, only.  not that we were disappointed with our portions either.  chris sweated bullets but enjoyed his seafood stew which is 50% larger than a seafood stew you could enjoy at a sit-down restaurant.  this time they prepared it with mussels instead of scallops - i prefer scallops for their less seafood-y smell.  i was pretty pleased with the tempura that was served on the side in a styrofoam box with  dipping sauce !  i received 2 pcs. shrimp, 1 pc. cauliflower, 1 pc. zucchini, 1 pc. carrot, and 1 pc. sweet potato.  the batter was closer to being authentic but i'm looking for the really crumb-y tempura batter....  my udon was huge.  they used shanghai noodles for udon noodles (like the seafood stew) and mine was like a vegetable udon with shreds of seaweed and pieces of barely cooked cauliflower, broccoli, and bean sprout.  i'm all for the vegetable presence and i'm all for raw vegetables with some  dip , but i didn't like raw vegetables floating in my soup.  further, the soup was very non-descript... just enough flavour to make it coloured but that was about it.  i wanted the five-spices but i don't think it was available.  what's really great about that place, besides the staff (korean) are really hospitable, that would suit even picky old me, is that you get a lot of food for your money.  because they are but a food stall renting the space and they don't have to hire waitstaff and wash dishes and such, they can pass their savings onto the customer... partly.  it's not quite like in toronto where you can get a rice / meat dish, soup, and a drink for $4, but it's the "upper end" and japanese/korean version of that that can be found in halifax.  they have to do that because of the competition they encounter there that is virtually non-existent here.  next time i'll get the maki/nigiri combo!  :)

        who is watching canadian idol?   based on some very skimpy  urlLink research  it seems that american idol had much the same "problem" that i have found with canadian idol.  well, i've just given up on the show.  no recaps from me or debates on the merits of those remaining and who should have stayed or gone because my natural musical ability is next to zero.  it's just that i think all the merit in the "singing contest" has been squandered by some insaniacs who voted for their dearest crush over 200 times.  i can't imagine what could be going on in their head to make such an exaggerated gesture.  which is exactly why i think all the credit is iffy for the top five people in the show.  it makes sense to me that those more sensible competitors simply had more sensible fans who voted  once  and not 50 times and certainly not stay up until three in the morning to vote in the pacific time zone.  is it just me thinking it's not fair for people to disproportionately represent themselves in the voting??  personally, i think  ryan  would make a  rock-awesome  "idol" because he's so  epitome canadian .  i wouldn't dare go to the halifax metro center tonight... it would most likely be garyland down there.   smoke-free....?  bah!   while i have already begun complaining....   urlLink on september 1, dalhousie university became the first university in canada to prohibit smoking on all university-owned property ....  it's a bit of a crock but really good advertising.  here are some infringements i have noticed: - as recently as last week, janitorial staff will set up camp in the large grass-covered islands on university avenue and smoke in packs since they can no longer do it at the doorway of the law building where usually they would hang out durings breaks (this, of course, is after most classes are over, after 6 p.m.) - students standing on the sidewalks of the grass-covered islands in the middle of the wide street which are not the oft-tread sidewalks - unabashed smoking while walking along, but this occurred on the fringes of campus  while the letter of the law (or rule) is not fully obeyed, there are some things you no longer see, like smokers within 5 meters of the doorways.  in fact, you don't see smokers anywhere near the doorway because that would be an obvious infraction.  and you won't see people closer to the heart of campus smoking and walking along.  so, it was at least successful in cutting out the most obvious presence of smoke but not entirely smoke-free.

        this is weird   reading a paper for a background survey for my project and looking through the references for the citation of papers i should read and realizing how i've either met the people who wrote the papers cited while at the ciar conference or the speakers there refered to other authors to such an extent that i feel like i know them also.  the non-phylogenetic papers that were cited?  there are many names familiar from hanging around while doing my undergrad here - i.e., professors in my department / (medical) faculty.  it makes our whole community feel that much smaller.

        it's nice to see halifax's smattering of lights!!   it was really idyllic to get back to halifax around noon and relax the rest of the day.   trust me , riding for two hours in a decade-old mazda 323 whose suspension was going cramped in the middle of the backseat with the sun beating down on you is  not  fun.  chris and i got to go down to waterfront - haven't done that with him and haven't done it but once or twice this summer.  we might be having an  indian summer  in that it was insanely cold (for the summer) and it was 30 degrees today.  sweltering, almost, or perhaps we just weren't used to being hot after being deprived for more than a year.  we walked around the  bishop's landing  area.  they have a handful of "upscale" shops and concepts on the ground-level of the super upscale condominium along the waterfront.  for example, there is high-end fusion dining at  urlLink bish , ethnic and upscale cuisine at  urlLink hamachi steakhouse , a spa (bliss), a unique gift shop (gifted), a dentist, florist, an ice cream shop (scoops), shoe shop, and the fourth installment of the  urlLink "italian...."  series in the form of    botticelli's .  unless i have the scoop really wrong, italian market (young & robie), italian gourmet (doyle street), italian deli (lower water street), and botticelli are owned by the same person.  though botticelli seems to veer away from the concept i saw in the market and gourmet in more than just the name....   someone  was reported to have returned from italy where he learned how to make gelato from the best of them and boasted of then serving the best gelato in the city.  we got each a scoop of pistachio and amaretto (2.95 each) in really nice neon plastic cupcake molds with neon plastic paddles to eat from.  i'm very impressed with the expenditure on presentation even if all the samplers we had this common fragrant scent....  i'm still a  urlLink diomio's  fan though....  we stopped in the    mulan chinese cultural center  on lower water street just across from bishop's landing.  this isn't a particular review since we didn't eat anything there.  they serve light chinese food snacks (like steamed buns and home-cooked-sounding rice dishes) and a huge assortment of tea in a pristine and spartan chinese environment.  it is also a store (wonder about the prices though i didn't poke about too much) selling artwork (some nice paintings and not your stereotypical carp watercolours), chinese fiction novels for kids and primers, tea sets, jade, some clothing....  it's not too trendy but it's nice and it's been a while since there has been a tasteful chinese novelty store.  i wonder how long  peking alley  has not existed....  for dinner we went to  urlLink momoya .  chris suggested a new japanese restaurant on quinpool (andy's) but i'm waiting for someone (reviewer or trustworthy sushi afficionado) to give an opinion first.  you just don't want a ruined sushi experience....  i ordered small tempura udon (6.80) and agedashi tofu (4.50).  chris ordered beef teriyaki (10.00) and the chef's special sashimi (28.00).  and he succumbed to enjoying japanese green tea with the meal.... :)  the tempura was good (forgot that the batter was the way it was - chinese-style) although i have gotten bigger pieces of shrimp before....  tofu was excellent was well.  chris' teriyaki was shockingly large-looking with a 12" round plate half covered with salad and the other half with rice and full slabs of teriyaki'ed beef covering all the rice.  we call the teriyaki (and my udon) the filler-food because just raw fish isn't enough to quench the appetite.  when we ordered the sashimi to be shared between us, i asked the waitress how many pieces came with it and she responded that there would "9 pieces."  i must have made a face or something because the prices i'm used in toronto (and granted i don't get sashimi specials here) are as follows: 3 pcs. each of 4 kinds of fish for $14-16, 3 pcs. each of 6 kinds of fish for $18-20.  so when the waitress did bring out the chef's special and it contained in the neighbourhood of 17 pcs. of fish and some other stuff, she seemed to tentatively asked me if the dish was big enough.  what was i supposed to say... no??  so, the rundown - it contained 4 pcs. salmon, 3 pcs. tuna, 4 pcs. red snapper, 2 pcs. surf clam, 2 pcs. (very small) shrimp, 2 pcs. scallop, and many pieces of salmon roe (the really jelly kind), and many pieces of slimey-eel'y-translucent-fish ( baht fahn yuu ).   how do you put a price tag on ecstasy?   to round out the day, we went to the jordan family home and watched the episode of  enterprise  i missed while on geek retreat and the first 45 minutes of  glad iator.  we munched on popcorn and washed it down with jasmine tea.  :)  (why can you pronounce "radiator" both rad-iator and ray-diator but you can't pronounce glad-iator glay-diator?  when the movie came out i kept calling it glay-diator driving my sister up a wall and correcting me everytime.  i deliberately said "glad-iator" and she was so used to correcting me she was tricked into saying it horribly "wrong."  :p )  when we were driving across the mackay bridge to get me home, i marvelled how much i missed the big(ger) city that i was deprived of for the meeting....

        geek retreat   as of tomorrow, i'm going on a four-day party, i mean, meeting, at beautiful  urlLink white point beach resort  on the south shore of nova scotia.  i shouldn't speak so lightly of it as i have absolutely no idea what i'm talking about....  my lab and the adjoining lab belong to the  urlLink ciar  evolutionary biology group and every year we meet with other ciar evo bio labs in canada (and beyond?).  our days begin with breakfast at 7 a.m. and presentations starting at 8:30 until lunch, followed by an afternoon session of presentations and an evening session until 9 p.m. with dinner in between.  and it goes that way for thursday, friday, and saturday.  i'm looking forward to some of the talks, meeting people, bonding with girls from my lab (like my cottage-mates), and hanging out with my colleagues in a less formal setting.  i might bring my laptop (haven't decided yet) and i might be able to blog from there....  if not, so long!  :)

        what's the real story?   i grumbled yesterday when i arrived at work late and had to prepare a shirley temple, a peach italian soda, and a strawberry soda (2.75).  it's fabulous that we serve $$-drinks, but sometimes when you have lots of other stuff to do, it's a bottleneck to have to prepare them.  throughout his meal, the guy asked for three more of  strawberry sodas .  while his female companion and a small child with him had normal sized meals, he ordered two appetizers for himself: chicken wings (8 pcs., 6.75) and pan-fried dumplings (8 pcs., 6.50, and on-the-spot preparation in the kitchen).  his main course was amusing -- a dish of honey garlic ribs all for himself (9.75).  just ribs, no rice.  and then he placed an order for a  strawberry cheesecake  (4.25) and a  butterscotch sundae  (3.50) while he ordered his fourth italian soda.  i had to smile a bit when it turned out that he ordered both desserts for himself....  which made me wonder if there was some story behind the indulgence.  (he's not fat, btw, rather, he's young and fit-looking.)  wyn: tomorrow he's being locked into maximum security prison and so today is his last day of freedom. mum:  [incredulous]   no....!  maybe he's going away and this is his farewell dinner. wyn: maybe he's in the army and he has to go overseas tomorrow (or soon) to, like, afghanistan. mum: maybe he just eats like this all of the time....

        super update   many a' things been happening, you could say....   glam it down   alright, it's official, i'm a  normal, normal girl  now.  i wear sneakers twice a week and jeans (albeit dark) and baby t-shirts.  and when chris and i went to  urlLink fong sing  for a vietnamese meal that was great for two for $22 (taxes in), and i was  happy  with that, is a sign that the  wyn-of-old  is taking a rest.  reading my old review (click the restaurant name above and follow the links), i realized that last time we got the special (5.95) pho which is why we got chicken, beef, and meat balls.  this time we got only the beef (5.50), a salad roll apiece (1.60 each), and another dish (!!): rice vermicelli with tofu & vegetables (5.25).  fong sing is a small restaurant with about twelve tables (not a whole lot of space in between) managed on friday by just one woman.  so, needless to say, the service was a bit slow.  it also meant we were not bothered a whole lot by servers (another owner/manager came out to assist her).  we got the salad rolls first.  the filling consisted of shrimp, bbq pork, vegetables such as cucumber and carrots, and cooked (but cooled) rice vermicelli.  we were each given our own dipping sauce that was a concoction of (vietnamese) hot sauce, hoisin or oyster sauce, julienned carrots and cucumbers, and sprinkled with broken peanuts.  i really appreciated the individual dipping sauce as we were then free to not only double dip but to swipe up the sweet and fragrant sauce in amounts to our hearts' content.  the pho was a bit rushed in the making, it seemed, as my pho noodles were packed solid together at the bottom.  not bad, but remember to get the special pho the next time!  no coriander present except on the side dish that had a mountain of raw bean sprouts, lime wedges, and coriander sprigs piled highi.  we worried that the other dish was cooling as we enjoyed the pho but, in fact, it was not a warm dish at all.  there was a bed of cooked but cooled rice vermicelli and over it cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, and dried fried tofu.  we were given a small jug of what i first thought was chinese red vinegar but it did not have the typical biting scent.  in fact, it was a sweet sauce with carrots and i can't put a name or words to the taste except when it was drizzled over the noodles, it was like sweet vinaigrette (vietnamese-style) over a really healthy vietnamese-style salad.  so, while i have previously felt the need to check everything off some kind of list of where-to-go and activities-to-do as quickly as possible (because you don't know when a "relationship" is going to end), a lot of the pressure is taken off when you know you're with someone for the long haul.  and we can go to the normal small places and enjoy them and some days, spaced out in time, i also get the finer dining and snottiness that i also crave.   "would you like fries with that?"   it was sinking pretty low but i found myself asking a customer that a week ago.  they were two older people who perused the menu and picked the same, cheapest item on the menu, a plain hamburger (3.15), for each of them.  i asked them if they wanted fries, gee, just one order of it (2.65), to be shared between them to make it three-quarters of a meal, but they refused.  i don't like having to work either at the restaurant or at school.  thank goodness that i received some good news at the end of the week that keeps me motivated, reminds me that i am of some value and possible use... and that i'm, no question about it, leagues and leagues above such a job that requires you to ask the above question throughout the day.   going away party(ies) for andrew   part I: last sunday, we dropped by his waterfront condo and chilled for about an hour after a really long day (more on that later) with his girlfriends (5 of them) and pat.  i have for so long avoided hanging out with his girlfriends and refused every opportunity to join him when he is with them (well, they go to marquee and i still can't bring myself to do that) which now strikes me as a bit sad because contrary to what i imagined, we were not neck-deep in talk about social issues or arts.  it was pretty normal.  :)  part II: on tuesday, i visited him at his house for the first time.  he has adorable dogs.  i met his family in their house - boy, was that weird - but it could also be me not used to normal things.  with four of his girlfriends and one guy, we went to    the granite brewery  on barrington street.  there are two levels to granite: an upstairs level is finer dining while the basement is more like a bar/tavern replete with fruit flies (ewww).  we hung out downstairs.  andrew ordered a sampler that provides you with 5 3.5 oz. glasses of their five granite beers.  i can only remember the names: ringwood (really light), keefer's-something-stout, and peculiar.  out of complete selflessness, because he knew i don't like beer that i've tried (you know, bottle normal beer), andrew had me try the darkest beer with a creamy head (keefer's).  it was surprisingly yummy and  no  i will not become a beer drinker.  i could become a 3.5-oz. beer-drinker, though.  jen ordered a half-beer/half-lemon-soda that was really yummy, actually.  so maybe i could become a beer/lemon-soda drinker as well.  the samplers were a winner and they ended up ordering one each by the end of it all.  andrew and i also ordered food.  he ordered calamari (6.00) and i ordered a large nachos (10.00).  the calamari was good.  it came with a garlic/chili sauce that had mayo consistency that was really yummy to coat all of your squid in.  the nachos were round and the yellow corn chips loaded with chunks of uncooked tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, round red peppers, and lots and lots of mozzarella cheese.  the salsa was kind of sweet, hardly a kick and so i ended up scraping off all the stuff that wasn't cooked and dipping in the so-so salsa.  hoping that andrew will locate my email address when he gets settled into his place and work - i'm really excited for him to get to go away and work for four months!   birthday sunday for chris   last sunday chris celebrated his birthday for turning 24.  yay!  twenty-four is a really big year, you know.  my own was really awesome, as i recall, because it was (after twelve years of waiting) my zodiac year again.  and  good luck and fortune and happiness  and such abound in your zodiac year.  well, at first we thought perhaps his parents had forgotten about him since he isn't living at home.  instead, they invited us with short notice for lobster dinner on their patio.  it was really superb.  the lobsters were huge (2 lbs. each) - i've never been given such a large one to tackle for myself but each of us were very well equipped for the task with nutcrackers and long and thin gauging devices each.  i provided the dessert -- ice cream cake from dairy queen -- narcissistically decorated with a  winnie-the-pooh  character because i never imagined it would be served at his parents' place!  (i wanted to get stitch from  lilo & stitch  but, alas, couldn't.)  after some lounging, his parents invited us to watch a movie.   open range  was not exactly what i would have picked out for myself to watch and it turned out to be a  scary movie  for me as well.  eek!  it was very interesting to hang out with his family....  k jokes about me spending more time with his family than with mine.  no question that i spend more time with her overall but it's true that i don't spend as much time with my family save if you count when i work on the weekend as spending time with them....  and i certainly do count that as quality time.

        back-to-school blues   today was my sister's first day of school in her last year as an undergraduate neuroscience student.  to be honest, there's a  bug  that comes with "back-to-school" that has affected even staid old me.  it's been, what, twenty years of "back-to-school" now for me and  finally  this year i'm not actually going back to classes.  in fact, there is no "beginning of term" or "end of term" for me because i didn't stop when my summer classes -- marking the end of my course-taking career (insofar as is necessary for the current degree) -- ended.  nope, no summer break and i just started working and researching instead.  so my sister and i observed this special day by getting coffee in the afternoon because on the first day of classes you don't have full hour/two-hour lectures and she found herself with little to do.  and this weekend mona, vinnie, and i mark the end of vinnie's freedom by going out and stuff.  :)  k asked me to make up a  dual schedule  because we've done that every since i've been home.  unfortunately (or rather fortunately) this semester i don't have any classes to fill nor do i have any definite things to do during the day (rarely).  so my end of the schedule reads a bit like a social calendar while hers is still very (undergrad) student-like.  show you that later when it's done....

        jeans shopping -- a humbling experience   a few years ago, i bought my first pair of jeans in a few years at  urlLink urban outfitters .  they were strange jeans indeed because they had this built-in faded look and the rise on it was really low (which is okay) which rode even lower when you sat down (no okay with me).  they were really skinny through the leg and a bit too long for me.  didn't wear 'em.  little did i know it would become the trend in the past two years.  my sister, on the other hand, has made good use out of them.  quick story: i haven't been a jeans-wearer in about five years or so.  probably because i usually see people  not  stylin' it in their blue jeans that i don't want to go through the agony of finding  the right fit  when i can find black (or other coloured) pants and khakis that are so much more styling.  then, the feet pain set it and sneakers are a twice-weekly staple now and for other reasons i'm not so so concerned about being the  perpetual diva .  and so jeans are an option now....  a few months ago, while shopping with thuy, i agreed to try on jeans at  bluenotes  that she was wearing at the time - dark navy blue skinny jeans - very elegant.  but there was no forgiving my more muscular thighs those jeans were not made for so everything was  squeezed  up and out.  and i abandoned jeans shopping yet again.  yesterday, i resolved not to waste time and exit the mall with a pair of jeans (darn it) and went shopping with my sister.  we went first to  urlLink american eagle outfitters  where there were a host of fits and rises and such but many were easily discounted because they were too trendy or they were "stretch" (meaning they were made extra skinny but with some  stretch  so you can fit your realistic legs in but don't do anyone justice but super skinny girls who eat salads and smoke in order to stay skinny).  and i'm not so  over the hill  to be wearing "relaxed fit" -- no sirree!  i tried on some sandblasted blue coloured version of their madison "favorite" jeans.  they were alright.  i nearly bought them (39.95) but stepped back from impulse.  then we went to  urlLink the gap  where there was a promotion - try on a pair of jeans and get $10 off it if you buy it.  necessary break, you know, because the jeans there started at $68 which was the most expensive of the ae jeans.  i agreed to try on the  urlLink long & lean  style that has like three tricks to make you look skinnier and taller - something around your bum, quite skinny through the legs, and something about the leg.  apparently they were advertised by oprah and she looked good in them also.  they were really great!  and i bought it in  urlLink this (rinsed) colour  instead.  i'm  thrilled  because they are elegant (by the colour of the jeans) and i didn't have to compromise with some old-lady style.  yay!   friends in __ places   k and i were reluctant to go shopping yesterday because a lot of little (young) back-to-schoolers would also be crawling the malls.  what we didn't expect was for us to run into so many people we know from school... and life... a sure sign that we (at least i) have been in this city far too long:  - lawyer guy jim is keeping a good employee record at sportchek - k and i were shocked to find we had a mutual acquaintance (her arts classmate and a friend of a former friend of mine) who helped us find sizes at the gap -- i thought the poor girl thought she knew both of us because she couldn't tell us apart but she actually knows us separately - a dancer from the vietnamese troupe - k's hs classmate who incidentally knows me though i've never met him because i ta'ed him - another mutual acquaintance has gone up in life from a sales position at the gap to one at club monaco (she's a student, too) - and i also knew the girl who worked at fairweather where i bought my first matching track suit set: my girlfriend's brother's gf and a fellow restaurant-kid

        happy hallowe'en!   and happy birthday to  paul .  :)  i wouldn't normally celebrate because it seems kind of lame but western culture has turned oct. 31 into a verifiable festival / celebration / occasion / holiday.  to celebrate, k and i went to tim horton's and i bought a  hallowe'en dip  (yeast donut with orange- and chocolate-coloured icing) while she bought a  hallowe'en bowtie  (a 6" eclair filled with orange-coloured creme, topped with a orange pumpkin-shaped sprinkles, chocolate bat-shaped sprinkles, and an all-sugar pumpkin decoration).  we don't need to eat lunch after polishing that off....  every year, i tell myself that i'm not going to take part in youthful activities to celebrate this... occasion... that i dont' see the fuss about.  but even adults have masquerade parties so why am i being so uptight?  this year, i'm going to be  goth girl .  yeah, that's so original, huh?  :p  there's going to be more lingerie-clad people about this year thanks to  urlLink neptune  showing  urlLink rocky horror show  this year....  and cs is having a  leather & lace  costume contest.  so goth really isn't original at all.  since i won't post a pic (this is the internet after all!) of what i'm going to wear (in it's entirety) let me  pique your curiosity .  i have assembled the following items to wear:  - black corset - black mini skirt - black fishnet stockings - angry bracelets with silver studs/spikes - long black hair extensions - 4" stiletto heels....  today, k clad herself in all black, and i gave her a black rose hair accessory to wear.  it's not all that obvious but there is still the spirit to freely be someone that you aren't normally.

        3 minutes    that is the length of time it takes for me to ascend 14 flights of stairs with 11 steps / flight.  i'm taking  "take the stairs instead of the elevator"  to an extreme, baby!!  uh, yes, that was not wyn talking.  you see, my grand plans for 3 runs and 2 body trims per week have been grandly squashed.  dalplex is twice as far from the  urlLink light tower  than its it from the  borg cube  and i tell myself that i don't deserve 2-hour "lunches" to go to dalplex because i'm supposedly getting paid and i don't usually make up those 2 hours....  so now i'm scrounging for activity - taking the stairs and resistance training while at home and would otherwise be sitting while watching a television show.  .... i'm hoping that this is just a (lazy) phase that will pass....  i really don't want my clothes to squeeze me....  (at right, an extremely long set of stairs in katmandu.)

        learning to live without o.c.   without watching the show, i thought  urlLink o.c.  could stand for "obsessive / compulsive" but i know the abbrev. would then be "o/c" and otherwise the advertisements didn't make an impression on me because i guess i got the premise of the show (whatever you can glean from a 30-second advertisement) mixed up with that of "the handler."   saturday , mum was on the phone with her sisters who all arrived in toronto (a family reunion she has to miss!  :(  ) at 4 when we were supposed to be at work so i flipped on the television expecting to catch the beginning of some canadian afternoon programming on  urlLink ctv .  surely, the scene(s) before the opening credits were kind of dark and therefore  canadiana-esque  and since i didn't recognize the actors in the show, i didn't clue into the  non-canadian show until  o pening  c redits.  since we had to take off to work, i taped the rest of the episode - after the first five minutes of hook, i had to know what happens to the cute brooding boy!   sunday : wow, wasn't that fortunate that in the  o.c. marathon , i only missed the second episode that was aired on saturday and got to totally emerse myself in the show with  four episodes  aired on sunday.  the show aired sometime during the summer and then had a hiatus before returning to the air for the fall.   monday : there was a mini-cliffhanger after episode 7 (which was not part of the marathon) but was mostly resolved in episode 8.  everybody is as happy as normal teenagers should be.  what kind of trouble will they get into and, more importantly, is it something i will stay interested in??   tuesday : no o.c. tonight!  it feels kind of weird that way....  have to wait until monday again....  funny how an addiction can hit so fast!

        wyn v. the penguin box    so, you think i know something about something do you....?  it took me a whole day to learn how to write a bloody 20 lines of  unix script .  i had huge difficulties because i  knew  what i could do, i just couldn't remember which command to look up to do it.  it required an alphabetical search through the korn shell commands (backwards, unlucky me) to find  cut  to satisfy my needs.  the day before, i had to ~shivers~ compile  phylip .  fortunately that turned out okay (and compiling  readseq  wasn't much of a problem either).  but since i am unix/linux incapable, i couldn't run the darned executable that was definitely an executable (at least this girl knows something about  chmod ) because i don't know the finer details about setting up paths....  ugh.  part of my problem yesterday came from wrestling with the   vi  editor .  i know like three basic commands (insert, delete, and how to quit the problem saving or scraping your changes... when you've wholly messed up) and learned two more.  but i didn't know that i could write a nifty script to interact with an interactive program and i was dishearteningly set to do it myself with 72 odd data files until chris showed me the light in under a minute.  he also pulled me out of a very menial rut when i thought i had to manually edit 36 files in  seaview  (oy).  i owe him so much.   jack of all trades... master at none   don't get me started... oh but i am getting myself started.  spent half of wednesday and most of thursday evaluating which phylogenetic inference tool to use - one was free and i got to see the creator at the ciar meeting two months ago - and the other one isn't.  the free-tool guy also wrote what my labbies consider  urlLink the bible  (okay, that was blasphemous but i didn't say it first!).  so i went with it....  used to be i'd get big, bad headaches because of the biochemistry or statistics content in papers i was reading.  it's getting better now.... :)  and my name is down as a member of the  urlLink statistical evolutionary bioinformatics group .  gotta live up to the hype....  a colleague of mine commented on how a cs master's grad who did her project in software engineering but has a bachelor's degree in biotech could get into bioinformatics.  though it is heartening that i wasn't all wrong in thinking the same thing, i know for a fact that someone who has left science for three years will have a tremendously difficult time.  while you don't need to be a master of all trades, boy, do you have to be a master at one of them (preferrably the biochem one).   them good ole days   i came online in the waning days (year) of  freenet  and the first browser i learned how to use was  lynx .  ( "a girl who knows how to use lynx.... sexy...."  - paraphased from an anonymous source)  today, i still use  lynx  on occasion and i use  pine  over web e-mail at all times possible.  i'm trying to wean off  pico  and  geek out  by learning  vi/vim/emacs  to the familiarity of good ole  pine  at some point... hopefully sooner rather than later. (motivation: vi renders code in beautiful multi-colour while pico doesn't.)  i also got a computer way back when when  commodore 64  was shaking things up and our next computer was an  ibm ps/2  (dos).  so even when windows became the norm, i'm still not reliant on mouse clicks... unless i am (you know, hotmail, grr).  .... am i the only one who feels  geek-power ?

          pie-eating contest & sushi-mania    12 pcs. salmon nigiri 12 pcs. tuna nigiri 6 pcs. scallop nigiri 6 pcs. shrimp nigiri 4 pcs. smoked eel nigiri ---- for 40 pcs. nigiri 8 pcs. tuna maki 8 pcs. salmon maki 18 pcs. california rolls 18 pcs. salmon & cucumber maki ----- for 40 pcs. maki  + tons of spicy sauce  all for 69.95 (taxes included).  this can be got from  urlLink sushi & noodle  who catered this sushi tray.  you see, i could have just let them give me only four kinds of nigiri and only 10 pcs. of salmon but i drew up a really neat list of my request -- a couple more pieces of salmon (more expensive) and not so demanding on the other items.  plus, in good faith, i ordered a sushi #2 from them (8.95 taxes in) which comes with 6 pcs. nigiri (2 pcs. salmon, 2 pcs. tuna, 1 pc. red snapper, and 1 pc. scallop), 6 pcs. california roll, and a miso soup.  so then  i got what i wanted .  :)  why did i have to put down a $20 deposit when people just call our restaurant all of the time and order over $70 of food and we make it?  to round out the meal really well, we also picked up  green tea gelato  from  urlLink dio mio's .  500 mL for 4.00.  that's a really awesome deal considering it costs $3-something for two scoops.  you just have to like a flavour enough to get 500 mL or be sharing like we were.  did i mention before (in another post) that gelato is made using less eggs and cream?   guilt-free  pleasure, hehe.  ... well, i don't feel too guilty anyhow because i did not participate in the  pie-eating contest .  chris and my sister (his brother was supposed to attend, too) split a 10" blueberry pie in half and raced each other in eating it...  my sister was doomed because she couldn't keep a straight face while eating and killed a lot of time laughing and not eating - we were both laughing until our abs hurt!

        it's true!!   according to  urlLink the scientist , dalhousie is the best non-american institution for workplace for postdocs and fourth overall when you consider american universities at well.  .... too bad the results are confined to science as there is only like one postdoc in cs and she is co-supervised by a professor in biochem.  they simply don't get enough money for cs postdocs!

        greetings from the light tower         hehe, i've been wanting to say that for a while....   urlLink dalhousie  has two towers on its campus: tupper tower (left) housing the medical school and all things medical science (except neuroscience) and the biology "tower" (right) housing all things biology + psychology + neuroscience.  since i would be in the tupper tower, i would characterize it as the  light tower  while k spends her days and nights toiling in biology and i call that the  dark tower  - it truly is very dark and danky in that building and there are reports of rats and cockroaches scurrying around in the dead of night!  the faculty of medicine, on the other hand, has to keep a leading-edge building so we have fast elevators (once you get one) and walk around with access cards and the like looking all  official  :).  i've resigned myself - i think i'll be stuck in the light tower for the next year since there is an overcrowding thing going on at the computer science building (middle) a.k.a.  the borg cube  (more neat pics  urlLink here ).  i'm on the eighth floor of tupper, looking at you.  :p  and my view is something like what you see in bottom past hospital district in the foreground with point pleasant park and the northwest arm in the backdrop.  i found out on my own this weekend that my  annual progress report  is three months overdue and that my  thesis proposal  was due last week.  i don't stress out about things like that because i know nothing bad's going to happen to me... i hope.  need to get out.  need to mingle with my cs folk again, like my counterparts who started the same time i did who could tell me this stuff!

        birthday day.... and issues rear their ugly head     for my sister....  i got her plush yellow senza slippers to match the walls of her new room and specially ordered a treatza pizza from dairy queen to enjoy while we had a  movie marathon .  i felt guilty that i didn't get enough for her for presents (and because i was busy buying stuff for myself today) that i also dipped into the bins at sweet factory and bought her an assortment of liqueur-filled chocolates, brazilian chocolates, and italian truffles.  for a moment, i thought we were going to get into trouble for her driving drunk because she was eating the liqueur-filled chocolates at an unbelievable rate but it didn't happened....  poor girl :p she had to work on her birthday.  we rented...  urlLink down with love  and  urlLink bend it like beckham .   down with love  was alright... it was a very, very girly romantic comedy.  i wasn't overly pleased with it.  and  bend it.... , i'm not sure i can watch that one again and here is why....  i thought it would be like  urlLink monsoon wedding  that was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.   monsoon  was 95% about an arranged wedding occurring in india.  although i knew there was a soccer thread in  bend it  (hence the name of the movie), i guess i was not prepared for the turn in the plot for the main character (jess).  it's not enough that she's defying tradition by playing soccer but she is also going against her parents' wishes by being interested in a guy who is not indian.  of course a movie is made the more interesting with some forbidden love going on....  and then made so heart-warming with a happy (modern) storybook-ending.  i guess deep down i'm slightly miffed by the light treatment by movies of cross-cultural relationships inevitably beginning with seemingly inflexible parents who bend conveniently at the end for a happy ending: they see how happy the daughter is made by the outsider-guy and they accept him because all they ever wanted is for their daughter to be happy and loved more than life itself.   every  movie concludes nicely - everyone (including the parents) comes out with dignity and grace in their actions:  urlLink my big fat greek wedding  and  urlLink joy luck club  are the first examples to come to my head.  in a recent episode of  urlLink nip/tuck , a caucasian guy pleads to the plastic surgeons to fix his eyes to ressemble those of his japanese girlfriend.  eloping for them is not an option because she does not want to be disown by her family so he undergoes this very rare surgery.  in the end, the mother doesn't buy it for a moment that he is japanese but accepts him anyways because he is willing to mutilate himself for her....  and before i read  joy luck , i read  urlLink sweet valley high  #50 titled "out of reach" about a chinese girl in california,  jade wu , has  really strict  parents but she is so talented at ballet she is allowed to perform and she and this guy have fallen so hard for each other they accept her going out with him....  i guess... that i am afraid my own ending will not be so happy.  i know that my parents dearly love me but i don't know if that love (which has been through much over the years) is quite strong enough to embrace the guy, even if he wildly loves me and can show them that.

        the rocky horror show    today is my sister's birthday (happy birthday!) so yesterday night we went out and watched the  urlLink rocky horror show  at  urlLink neptune theater , you know, the east coast's oldest and most prestigious theater.  i selected two shows for our viewing pleasure amongst this year's line-up with rocky horror being the first one and the season finale,  cats , being the second one.  usually, i choose  big names  and sometimes i haven't the faintest clue what it will be about (like this show and "best little whorehouse in texas" would be another) but attend in good spirit that neptune won't do too badly for their sensational shows.  of course, i have what k calls racy tastes so we should not have been surprised with what we came upon.  now i understand the meaning of it being a cult classic when released in 1975.  it had considerable shock value even now (of course some material has been updated, i don't know which yet) even though we  have seen everything  by now.  at times it felt a bit like a burlesque which i'm not sure agreed so much with me and the audience participation was slightly unsettling.  it was nice anyhow to see something that was a bit before our time but it's fame (infamy?) still lingers.  ... meanwhile, i was thinking of how i need to buy a  dog chain and fishnet stockings  if i want to have the complete look for halloween....

       i have a  urlLink Very Important Meeting  tomorrow at 10 a.m.  i'm dreadfully nervous.  petrified out of my mind.  though it is over a day away, i am already not feeling well.  it was supposed to be this afternoon and i didn't ask for it to be postponed but one person had a deadline to make today.  it can be postponed indefinitely and i'd be happy.... :(

        the fooler sweater     the "look" this "season" is the  fooler sweater .  correction: it's not the trendiest of trend looks but it is a unique-to-fall-2003 item.  and it probably will turn up at many a garage sale next summer because the trendoid owner realizes that it cannot possibly be worn amongst the unique-to-fall-2004's!!  the idea: for the price of 1 (i.e., ~$20),  you can get a faux sweater (knit, but not thick) with faux shirt collar and cuffs stitched to it.  and  voila  you get a preppy sweater-and-shirt look that can be  super svelte  because you don't actually have all the layers bunching up and increasing on your silhouette.  i have included, for your comparison, two images from not-too-sexy merchants:  urlLink sears  and  urlLink land's end .  youth variations of the fooler sweater are, of course, more snug to the body (much more than the beige sweater you see here).  the downfall: besides that next year it will be a depreciated waste, you're stuck being the beige-"sweater"-with-white-pinstripes girl with no hope of changing the mix-n-match and you also don't really  have a white pinstripe shirt at the end of it all.  further, it should be a  warm  outfit but it is not because it is only one layer of clothing so in the winter this looks sensible but you have to put a fleece or cardigan (!!) over this "sweater" to actually keep you warm.  since these days i have traded in my  clubwear-come-daywear  look for a more sedate (read: practical) one, i am eager to  vamp up  "business wear."  so i was ready to hop onto the bandwagon of really-tight fooler sweater wearers except for being restrained by my more sensible and preppy sister.  considering the volume of clothing that i'll be trying to sell off this or next month (garage sale), i'd rather minimize clothing purchase mistakes and held out on a $20 fooler and found a $10 black v-neck sweater that is thin as to not add bulk that i can wear over different coloured collared shirts.  granted, it's not a tight sweater but layers = warmth and preppy = timeless and prettiness comes from your face and smile and  not  from how tight your clothes are.  boy i am getting so old....   satc girls   based on  urlLink an analysis of the distribution of birthdays in the calendar year  the most expected births occur in july to october.  a common theory is that, well, the conception time for july to october babies is october to january which are relatively cooler months in the northern hemisphere that presumably the study was confined to.  and you know what can happen in cooler, wintery, stormy, snowy weather... some cuddling and canoodling....  so the first of my october birthdays was on friday.  the second and third are my sister's and paul's in a week and three weeks.  we went to  urlLink mexicali rosa's .  just a small party consisting of two couples and another girl friend who chose to go solo.  this is a radical departure from the birthday dinners of yore (of last year and the year before, etc.) which consisted entirely of girls because there were simply more of us around and none of us back then had guys special enough to take to our best girlfriend's birthday dinner, including the birthday girl herself.  the original plan was to have dinner and then go out to a club for the rest of the night.  as it turned out, we lingered at the restaurant because it was too much fun and drank a bit at the birthday girl's apartment but we didn't end up going out due to a host of unforeseen events.  it's all good, still; i was, honestly, looking forward more to the fun dinner portion than a drunken night at a sweaty club anyways....  sometimes we call identify ourselves akin to the  urlLink sex & the city  crew and occasionally we can all meet (schedules are prohibitive!) for lunch or to go downtown together.  however, i think of us as having a one-up on the real satc crew because we aren't commitment-phobic but instead we are all (finally) involved in "official" and growing and great relationships with guys.  we're growing up and it  is  good....

        support asian american film    this weekend i had the opportunity to pick a movie for the viewing pleasure of both me and chris.  good thing  urlLink better luck tomorrow  was on the shelves because i have a really difficult time justifying several hours spent in sedentary mode even for the oscar-sweeping movie of the year.  i wanted to see it since last year and knew that the selection of this movie will appeal to both our cultural sensibilities even if the movie overall wasn't good.  but it was!  i'm really pleased that besides the gangster goings-on that i find distasteful, it was devoid of the things that make americanized martial arts/kung fu movies so aggravatingly  similar .  and there wasn't  asian pride  and profusive thuggin' going on either.  the central characters were not-too-slick first-generation high-schoolers coming of age and that is always an interesting story if done properly.  and in my opinion, it was - it was compelling and not just because the characters were chinese but because it was realistic and not corny.  well, i promised not to be a movie reviewer so i'll stop it at that.  here are two people more eloquent than i am ( urlLink link ,  urlLink link ).  not surprisingly, i'm a real sucker for "asian american" (read: chinese-american) movies.   urlLink joy luck club  was great fun even though it perpetrates nasty stereotypes about chinese men; i love  urlLink eat drink man woman  even though it's not technically american at all; and i'm on the lookout for a movie called  urlLink 100%  starring garrett wang of st:voyager fame.  :)

        hurricane spoils   we were really busy at the restaurant for the fourth night in a row yesterday night... hurricane spoils, i tell you.  will there be a fifth night?  it is seriously exhausting - i really admire how my parents can do it everyday.  i get a day off tonight.  15,000 people still don't have power... could they be all in dartmouth??  it's not just a lack of power thing.  it's also that people are tired of eating at home, celebrating their new "freedom" from having lights and amenities again - a whole bag full of reasons.  it's good, goes towards paying for the sign which cost, i made a mistake, $1700.  and  today  marks the first time we have sunday-shopping in nova scotia - some stores are opening today to give people who were shut down in the beginning of the week a chance to catch up on their shopping.  i'll bet some people will go to the grocery stores just because they are able to on a sunday....

       yes, i'm back.  got back power tonight and the my internect connection is also back, as you can see.  i implore you to start from the  urlLink beginning .  oct. 1. 1153   ONGOING CHRONICLES   we got our phone back (we will stay loyal mtt customers for a while yet).  this would be day 3 without electricity.  an electrician came and set straight some wire-holder so we're set to go for the power co.'s people to string up wires again.  i called them and we're in queue.  they don't promise a crew will arrive today or tomorrow but by friday!!  we should have called yesterday and lied about having everything set for the power crew and then we'd be a day ahead on the queue....  yesterday k and i cruised about halifax and paid chris a visit at his power-less, phone-less apartment.  we visited liverpool street that has become famous - front page of tuesday's paper and the oft-shown image on the news with a huge tree lying across a car.  it was the epitome of devastated streets with the most fallen trees per length of street.  otherwise, halifax is quite messy.  so many neighbourhoods are tree-lined and so many have fallen trees.  fenwick residents have been displaced again for another week this time.  it is so sunny outside it seems as if not much is amiss.  except the face of the city's parks are forever changed.  and there will be prevalent reminders of the storm with the presence of tree stumps where tall trees once stood.  it's not like i'm totally in the know but yesterday  no one  in halifax had power yet.  or phone.  we opened the restaurant for business and i saw our broken sign for the first time.  it is so heartbreaking.  we replaced it a couple of years ago after ten years and to have to replace it again (80% of it blew off - we don't know where and inot how many pieces) - we're talking about $7000 - is heartwrenching.   this  is the cost of juan to us.  oh, and 1 broken window at the new house and the cost of connecting us back to civilization.  they already closed the school (for classes) until monday and you know how reluctant universities are about closing because we operate on an extremely tight schedule.  i just kinda hoped to get power back before the majority of people instead of dead last like it seems will be the case....  oct. 1. (0743)   CHRONICLES OF A HURRICANE   i want things to be normal!!  our neighbourhood's power resumed (less than 24 hours after the outage) but we were left in the dark.  things seems moderately 'normal.'  our fridge is running and so is our television.  how, you ask?  our neighbour whose tree fell on our car taking out the power line at the same time gave us an extension cord from his house.  funny how those two amenities are sooo soothing.  i still want a hot shower... and internet access.  news bits:  - public gardens got demolished - no joke.  century-old trees blown over at the gates and beyond - mona and vinnie at fenwick slept on a flooding floor in the basement.  they got back into their apartments only to be evacuated again because fenwick with blown-out windows, blown-in walls, and water in the walls was deemed unfit to live in and they were moved into a hotel - 600 military personnel are in the city (prob. in halifax, i haven't been there) to help with the clean up - my boyfriend is missing....  we're sitting around the house waiting for electricians to arrive, for phone people... then we'll be normal.  sep. 30   JUAN + BAD_LUCK = MAJOR_INCONVENIENCE   since everyone else is self-centeredly tallying their losses and grievances, here are mine/ours:  - fridge full of meat that is warming up - restaurant fridge full of meat and no power - fortunately we have power at the other restaurant - and a working firdge there - our neighbour's tree fell down on our car, taking down the power line to our house.  damage: a small dent on the roof of our car and the antenna snapped - because our wire was dangling, ns power cut  all  wires to our house so when power resumes in our neighbourhood we are still waiting an electrician and phone person - three of our gold fish at the restaurant died, including our footlong  beloved koi  :( :( :( (that is estimated to cost $50) - our two-year-old, recently replaced restaurant sign blew off and smashed into pieces - k's not able to go in today (tomorrow?) to feed/weight/test her mice - that translates to a hole in her experiment - at our new house, a window blew out and the uncovered insulation (some, not a lot) blew all around causing a nasty, cotton candy "snowstorm" to our neighbours on either side  but we've also been really lucky:  - our sunroom(s) are intact - our shingles and roof stayed on - minor, minor flooding only - our car wasn't hit worse - we got to have a whole-family dinner, an occasion only for thanksgiving and christmas  it was weird waking up.  first of all, i slept on the prickly couch (ouch).  the sky was yellow and the landscape had changed - kinda  tropical .  the woods across the street had blown over and we can see houses we previously could not see on the other side.  people are cruising around looking for hurricane spoils and they stop in front of our house and take a picture of our car under an uprooted tree.  since there's no electricity and random things happen (i think a distant neighbour's bbq grill went up in a fireball and a bang -- it was their transformer exploding or something) everyone's on the street and it's so quiet you can hear all the chatter.  it's probably going to be an early night!    sep. 30. (0117)   EYE   i woke up after i felt in my sleep my bed shaking.  it seems to me like every year the us eastern seaboard is hit by a hurricane and just a couple of weeks ago, i was indirectly touched by isabel: a  urlLink daily blog read of mine  lives in north carolina and disappeared for about a week.  it feels like our little house is in the eye of this hurricane and feeling your bed shake because of some natural weather phenomenon is  weird .  i can't see anything outside the window - it's pitch black.  my daddy's awake.  i'm like him.  mum and my sister are surprisingly sleeping through all this.  mona and vinnie are okay.  i thought i was paranoid to be worried about blown-in windows but apparently that is what happened to some floors in fenwick.  i hope i didn't seem callous by not inquiring, "omigosh, are you all okay?" because i know no bodily harm will arrive if you stay indoors.  i know the girls are physically fine if i can't say the same for their apartments....  :(  and i lost touch with chris like 2 and a half hours ago.  i know he's ok, too, maybe lonely.  :p  that's okay... so am i!!  hope he won't be needed (as in his reserve unit) for relief because it's not so bad but if he/they are, we're in good hands.  lesson - from the girl who thought typhoon level 8 was fun - hurricanes are serious stuff.  we're sitting (or lying in bed as the case was half an hour ago) waiting for the  awful and indiscriminant eye  to pass.  ok, i'm going to enjoy this moment with my daddy.  i'm out.  (0131)

        the beauty of privacy screens    so the whole  open concept  that was so innovative for the graduate student workspaces at dalhousie computer science isn't the success everyone is pleased with.  so, in the past month, we have been allowed to procure privacy screens that we clamp to the edge of our tables (choice of whiteboard, pinboard, or translucent glass) that have effectively sectioned off our work areas from, well, each other's.  unfortunately the students in my space (fortunately the chattery ones don't roll in until 2p.m.) get really worked up when there are all together and it sounds like a  marketplace in china  even through all the barriers we have thrown up.  good thing for the height of the privacy screens, we can duck our heads behind them and bellow out an anonymous and reprimanding,  "shhh!!"   that shuts them up, for a short period of time.

        student politics   far be it for me to agree to be in any kind of organization that even slightly smells of politics.  but there i was this summer attending a meeting of students-organizing-themselves because, truthfully, my grad student experience hasn't been all i thought it would be.  this sentiment, apparently, was shared by others.  (caveat: i had no idea what i was getting myself into when starting my master's.  there was just this inner drive planted in me to  get a higher degree .)  more recently, there was talk of us being a grad society and a constitution was floated around where i actually was given the position of  vice-president  (nepotism, i tell you).  fortunately, at an even more recent meeting, we decided not to have these figurehead positions and to design committees instead that are  task-oriented .  that suits me  much better  because i consequently joined the committees concerning areas that i am interested in changing.  it's also strange for me to want to effect a change for future generations of dalhousie cs-er's.  afterall, it goes against my selfish self by wanting to help other people....  but the current situation of the students (and i mean the positive current situation) wouldn't be as such if it weren't for pioneering, community-minded grads (ours is a new faculty for the university) that came before me.  it's  empowering  to think that we can cause some change that will make other people's lives easier.  (it's easier to think you could have an impact if the student body is smaller, like at dalhousie.)  it is a far better feeling than being  apathetic  (that contagious disease) and to be  in the know .

        pizza to die for... no, not a restaurant review   i heard that the average number of toppings on pizza chosen by americans is like 2 (pepperoni & cheese being the favourite) while the average number of toppings on pizza ordered by canadians is somewhere around 5.  see?  we appreciate more variety ( style ) and you might hope that in our extra toppings we would strive for "healthier" pizzas.  last night, we passed on take-out pizza (~$20 for a large) and on pre-made fresh pizzas at the supermarket ($6) to make our own.  tell me if it wasn't worth it even if the cost wasn't as low as initially thought:  - two  pizza crusts  - 1 herb, 1 cheese flecks ($3.50 ea.) - 1/3 can  baby corn  ($0.50) - 1 can  articoke hearts  ($ ?) - some amount (i forget) of  extra lean ground chicken  ($3.71) -  tomato sauce ) ($ ?) - 1/3 packaged  portabello mushroom  slices ($2.00) - 3 diced  plum tomatoes  ($1.20) - 1 stalk of  broccoli  ($0.66) - 200g  medium cheddar cheese  ($2.99) - sprinkling of  oregano   + it was fun to make (we snacked on the raw toppings, like polishing off the other 2/3 can of baby corn)  essentially we had  salad medley  on flatbread but it was really, truly delicious.  i think it cost around $20 for two "medium" pizzas which were really the best pizza we've ever had.

        diet = "die with a T"    last week's diet tip: no dessert, no junk-food snacks results: minimal weight loss, but didn't feel bloated or anything that may occur after the consumption of sweets and (my - should we say  mein  -  Favoritest ) salty snacks.  it wasn't so hard to decline dessert.  it's a lifestyle choice and i secretly chortle over the number of calories dessert-eaters do consume....  this week's diet tip: no dining out this week (tuesday, nov. 25 - tuesday, dec. 2). urlLink *  results: we'll have to see....   ultra weight loss tip:  train for a  urlLink marathon .  get it?  nova scotian = bluenoser.  the logo is so adorable i have to join!!   *  monday's visit to  urlLink china classic  was decent but very heavy and heavy-inducing....

        bananas all around    i've added a new "frequently read blog," (see right sidebar)  banana blog .  after reading the first page, i'm hooked enough to link them (sorry to the blog that i ousted for it).  what hooked me is that several of the bloggers are engineers and in ontario (namely, waterloo, don't i know the feeling) and some even are grad students in engineering. ~shivers!~  the name is inspired by the 2000 book  urlLink banana boys  that i now want....

        pictures    finally , i'm timely about  something .  i developed a roll of black & white film and the  urlLink results  are kind of twilight-zoney.  there is one picture so far from  urlLink snowball , pictures i was referring to in  urlLink this post , and a vintage pic from last summer!   some people like a spa....   but for me  to relax and feel centered, i sit down with a chinese dictionary and chinese text  and start reading / translating.  because, of course, for me english is my better language and so written chinese (my first language) has to go through a translation process.  i read an article titled "a study of the one thousand most frequently used chinese characters and their simplification" (jclta - journal of the chinese language teachers association).  once someone has learned these one thousand characters, they have learned the "bulk of the chracters of the working chinese language".  i remember reading once about how illiterate citizens during the cultural revolution were rigourously educated for three months during which they learned ~1,000 designated characters the knowledge of which enabled them to then read newspapers and communicate.  ok, so i'm not so hard-core and i've always considered reading/writing to be the easier part of my chinese education because i got a really good start (mummy taught me while i was a toddler and really strict chinese tutors in hk) in that.  learning to speak mandarin - as i am learning that i don't have a tongue for languages - is another matter and that is a  stressful  endeavour that is not progressing at any rate at all.  there is always this small nagging voice at me asking, "how do you ensure that your child(ren) is not total twinkie urlLink * ?"  my mum is an immigrant so she taught me the real thing.  as second generation chinese who has gone back  home , it's my duty to pass on everything i can... don't really want to think about the plight of the third generation when mine is so hard....  i'm concerned that the best i can do is pass on some kind of bastardized version of what i was taught.  though i cannot speak for the efforts of my significant other to be, this is one thing i can do that i know is certainly in the right direction.   that  is why it brings me a sense of peace and balance.   * twinkie - is a (questionably) derogative metaphor for canadian-/american-/british-born chinese (japanese, korean, etc.) characterizing the fact they have a foreign exterior but westernized values.  synonyms: banana,  jook sing .   jook sing  means "hollow bamboo."  i once heard it had a white mooshy inside but i might be mistaken.  it does symbolize an imbalance in the  jook sing .

        snowball?  it was good....   it was awfully nice to see so many people out for it (~200 ppl.), for the most part nicely dressed (i would ben an exception).  the room was nice - because it was filled! - the food was nice - i stayed away from  bad food choices  like potato salad, pasta salad, gravied turkey with stuffing and stuck with  health ier   food choices like tomato salad, coleslaw, rice pilaf, steamed vegetables, and fish (haddock?) in light cream sauce.  dessert consisted of really foreign things (to me) like apple/icing angel cake, egg nog cheesecake with cinnamon cake center, and what i can only describe as a crumbled fruitcake.  (yes, it's a buffet with many items and i would still have to report on the contents.  it wasn't fabulous food but it was adequate.)  i learned that it takes  31 bobbypins  to secure my hair in a huge pompadour.  i told the hair stylist that my dress is japanese-looking and she proceeded to make my hair a la  geisha ... in her forties.  i learned that if i can't dance to something (like funk/jazz music), it helps a lot to have a set pattern of steps that we'll call  "freeform jive."   our social dance instructor would have been appalled and claimed to never have taught us but it was fun nonetheless.  i learned that i cannot drink more than half a glass of wine per night.  (please excuse redness of face in any pictures!  which will come as quickly as the halloween ones did....)  i learned to compromise.  i wanted to dance to r'n'b music while chris was loathed to and he wanted to dance to the band and i didn't think i could dance to it.  we ended up dancing to my  absolutely-must-dance  tunes (like "around the world" by atc) and to the jazzy tunes only until my knees/hips/feet grew tired.

        241 night      a  don cherry's  on spring garden that opened during the summer.  i hadn't planned on trying that place as much as i like to be able to say i have been inside the  big  restaurants to be, well,  restaurant savvy  because it's a  sports bar .  chris raised my expectations telling me that nice sports bars - unlike the studen-overrun one in waterloo, the name escapes me now.... - have leather couches and many televisions for the boggling number of dedicated sports channels there are out there.  then k told me they have a pasta night and since  urlLink your father's mustache  yanked their monday spaghetti nights, we have to go to the only other place!  i don't quite undersatnd why on a deal-night there aren't more people there taking advantage of the deal nor do i understand why some people go there and  not  order pasta.  the restaurant is pleasantly new and the seating area is large and divided by dark wood dividers.  no plump leather seats for us - just really hard wooden chairs.  there were four television screens over the bar each broadcasting a different station and there were many more television screens at different angles but were there more than four channels?  i don't know.  we learned that as part of the special you can order two pasta dishes and it will cost you only 11.95.  if you order two dishes each 9.95 separately, you still pay 11.95 in total.  the priciest pasta was a chicken parmesan for 11.95.  i ordered chicken tetrazzini (9.95) while k ordered chicken tortellini (10.95).  we ordered iced teas (1.95 covers the drink plus one refill, we think).  my chicken tetrazzini was really great - creamy and tasty.  the pieces of chicken in mine were not so plump as those in k's tortellini and thus not so obviously water-injected.  it was not the mass amounts of spaghetti you get at yfm for cheap but it was not too little - cream sauce also helps make you feel full.  k's chicken tortellini was good and it took half the amount of the dish for her to get full off - very cheesy!  all pasta dishes are served with garlic bread.  the rest of the menu we only glossed over as we only went there for one reason: pasta.  very standard bar fare.  the prices are reasonable - i wouldn't say they were overpriced.  don cherry's sport grill 5650 spring garden rd.    we went to  urlLink dio mio  after dinner to see if we could get in on the  2 for 1  tartufo deal.  (i went the tuesday before and they were out of tartufo at 5 p.m.)  yes, i know i'm on a  semi-diet  but it seemed  so hard  to get tartufo that if there was some left, i would consider it fate and order one.  k got rasberry center tartufo while i got orange grand marnier center.  our favourite dio mio employeed drizzled chocolate sauce and rasberry/grand marnier over the corresponding tartufo and decorated with whipped cream along the border of the plate.  the tartufo (not the shabbiest in size) was heavenly delightful.  good thing gelato is made with  less cream & eggs .   normally an order runs at 4.13 (for eat-in) and we got it for half the price.   :) .

        love actually  urlLink     reallysuperawesomemovie.goseeit.  best hugh grant movie.  instead of one love story that drags out and is ill-drawn, there are about six going on and you'll fall in love with at least half of them and care intensely about the others.  i don't buy dvd's but i want this one when it comes out.

        a lesson in chinese cuisine  (skip to the  urlLink lesson )    in my turn to choose, i chose  the hungry chili  as our dining destination on saturday night.  to be honest, i was just a bit apprehensive because i wasn't sure what kind of food to expect and it was in the former  urlLink thai chili house  spot so i was reliving experiences of ordering food that i couldn't eat - or enjoy.  that's because i have given up being  haute couture  or something and being a thai-food-eater.  sweet + sour + hot is way too weird a combination for me to handle.  rant aside....  i read about the arrival of a sichuan/szechuan restaurant in the old chili house spot in my weekly arts & culture paper,  urlLink the coast , and have been hankering to try it out before the coast reviews it.  and it's my  responsibility , you know, to check out the chinese restaurant scene since my parents don't have the time to....  the small space on blowers street was slightly redecorated with the removal of non-permanent thai relics for some red-themed chinese ornaments and water colour prints.  it's all good, better than restaurants that sock you in the stomach with gold gilt and red dragons galore.  a notice on the door says "cash only.  sorry for the inconvenience," but my parents who are in the know say you can get your visa machine in a day (a week, if you allow them to exaggerate) within opening and they've been open a month.  it still housed about seven tables for four.  menus are in holders on the tables so you can seat yourself and start figuring out what to order.  i was immediately impressed with the care taken to make the menu.  not in the dishes, per se, but with the colour paper cutouts of an angry chili, happy tomato, borders, etc., that are pasted onto the empty spaces of the menu.  (these are references to an art of much more intricate cutouts of entire village scenery on really fine paper.)  from other people in the know, i learned that their hot & sour soup is not all that (for its ingredient mix) and so we steered clear of it, and that the eggplant dish (9.49) is really yummy.  we ordered ginger tofu (8.49), glass chicken - medium hot (9.99), hot numbing shrimp (11.99), and a large steamed jasmine rice (4.50).  you also help yourself to these wooden chopstics (sanitation anyone??) they leave in a cup on the table by the menus.  glass chicken and ginger tofu arrived first with the rice.  frayed pieces of chicken that looked like they were ripped by hand is stir-fried with glass (green bean) vermicelli, pickled cabbage, and chili.  i would learn after dinner that the pickled cabbage is a szechuan (or what we cantos call "out-of-province" thing) that lent the dish a sour taste along with the spices from chili.  a glass vermicelli dish is really reminiscent of dishes we cook at home.  (we'd substitue fuzzy melon - yum - for the cabbage.)  ginger warning: as much as i knew that there would be ginger in the ginger tofu dish i hadn't really expected the small slivers to be blended in so well with the bamboo shoots that also accompany the dish.  i would have appreciated more than two pieces of wood ear that are promised for the dish.  the tofu was the fried kind (from its leathery exterior) that was then stir-fired in a lot of pepper with onions.  it's a nice vegetarian dish but i found the tofu soaked up a lot of salty sauce.  i think they should just stir-fry unfried tofu for the dish.  we ordered the hot numbing shrimp as hot as they saw fit to cook for us.  it came with 9 pieces of shrimp (being the freak i am, yes, i do count them), stir-fried with peppers, onion, and szechuan peppercorns, and sprinkled with cashew nuts.  the server showed us the peppercorns some of which was kept in an urn for display that made it really bite your tongue.  i liked this dish best perhaps for its predictability and ressemblance to cantonese cuisine.  they had a promotion that we snapped up: buy one main dish and get a "crispy banan roll" with ice cream for 2.99.  turns out that "crispy banana roll" is a banana with chocolate paste rolled in spring roll wrap and deep-fried.  it was also a true "out-of-province" dish and better in some ways, i think, than the banana tempura i once had at  urlLink hamachi house  (where the tempura batter slid off the banana).  it was nice and i had to shelve the diet for an evening ... that's why it's called a  semi-diet !  (i want to go back and try their  dan dan  noodles.  it's an excellent dish of egg noodles in chicken broth made spicy and fragrant with peanut and sesame paste and chili!)  *** after the fact *** click  urlLink here  for another visit on december 12, 2003    when i got home and being a dutiful daughter i reported my culinary experiences to my mum who grilled me on the tastes and ingredients and then gave her opinions.   apparently you're a gastronomical expert if you are born and raised in canton .  there are several kinds of  big  cuisine ( dai choy ) in china that are renowned and sought after.  you can tell which ones they are by what is available in restaurants in hong kong (and, to a lesser extent, in toronto).  famous cuisine is cantonese, beijing, shanghai, chiu chow, and hakka.  maybe not necessarily in that order, but cantonese is up there.  there is an expression,  sick zoy guang zhou  which means "do your eating in canton" urlLink *  because it has the most colourful, flavourful, and most extensive of all the dishes.  notice how szechuan is not a renowned cuisine....  i wondered why mum kept calling the dishes "out-of-province" (or  oy sahn ) as if the rest of china outside of our southern province of canton is this big void for cuisine and culture.  turns out it is.  well, as in cantonese cuisine dominates in the south and nothing really holdes a candle to it.  this "szechuan" thing is hardly noticed in hong kong but it may be a hit thing here because it sounds so darned foreign and exotic, no?  beyond "cantonese."  afterall, "canton" is actually an english word (it has a latin origin).  how the question is, "what is  authentic  food?"  you know, canadians harp on wanting the  real  stuff.  granted, battered chicken in the shape of balls soaked in neon red sauce isn't authentic but are they really ready for the not-so-presentable food that we really do eat on a daily basis?  we have a version of "meatloaf" (not that i really know what meat loaf is) that is a pork patty/melange with bits of mushroom that is lazy tuesday's dinner that wouldn't be impressive to see served at a restaurant.  fine cantonese cuisine (the only kind of cuisine that can command $1000+) is  song  (best translation i can come up with is "fresh, brilliant, crisp in colour.")  no other cuisine is considered fine enough for such a price.  (take for example what we really do eat at a big canto dinner - shark's fin soup that costs $20 per small bowl because the shark's fin is so precious.)  there is a name  gah heung  that we call food that has the appearance of being served in a small village household.  you know, dishes very non-descript, maybe sloppily presented but replete in flavours.  i made the argument that hungry chili is indeed authentic because it uses such  oy sahn  ingredients as pickled cabbage and the peppercorns bearing its name, that the canadians are truly getting what they would eat in their households in china.  whether or not mum approves of the very economical ingredients in the place of more choice vegetables is another story altogether.    there is a proverb that goes  sang zoy su zhou, sick zoy guang zhou,  say zoy lang zhou  meaning "marry in su province (they have the prettiest -  mei  - girls), eat canton (best foot), and die or be buried in lang province (where they have the finest wood for your coffin)."

        human experiment    so there's this  ball  i'm going to on friday, nov. 21.  you could say that i'm enjoying my last days/weeks/year with a moderate metabolism by "challenging it" by eating like a teenager with little care of the consequences.  you could also say that i simply don't know how to say "no" to junk food.  i am neither a  sweet tooth  nor a  salt fiend  - i change my allegiances every day in order to be able to enjoy everything.  that's gotta stop.   :(   for the past year, my weight has been flip-flopping above an awful equilibrium weight and then falling below it the next day.  my plan with the  very motivating (read: "i want to look spectacular")  event coming up is to cut out junk food and continue as i have being a  very good girl  and running three times a week.  (i work, too, on the weekends but i never count that officially just like you wouldn't count having to walk downtown from work or anything.  well, i don't count that as a physical exercise substitute, ever.)  it's going to be really hard with christmas around the corner and the tradition in my household is to have stacks upon stacks of chocolate - gifts from our employees and other chocolates that we indulge in because they aren't sold around the year.  maybe i wil have to perform a trade in order to enjoy  some  chocolate.  i'm hungry.   :(   wish me luck.

        international calls    on tuesday night and last night i spent hours on the phone with dell technical support trying to get the myriad of problems with my computer fixed.  on tuesday, i called from my cell because a six months ago when i last placed a call, i was connected to a friendly techie in the states (i presume).  but on tuesday, i was connected all the way across the pacific ocean and, trust me, it sounds terrible over a cell phone.  the techie was still friendly, but it was difficult to feel that i was getting interactive support when there was a three-second delay on each side of the conversation.  here are things that have happened to my laptop... and my lessons learned: 1. battery was quite dead as soon as i got the computer.  (replace the battery under the first year warranty.  replace it as many times as you need to get a good one that lasts because the warranty is only for the first year.) 2. dvd-rom stopped reading dvd's within two months.  (don't replace the operating system (winme) with something prettier (winxp) - they wouldn't support me because i was honest about it.) 3. a year later, i thought i lost half my ram.  (turns out i may have been wrong.  should have sprung for the extra ram when i was buying though that would have pushed my laptop to the $3,000 range.) 4. a year later (from purchase), my cd-rom completely died.  (they sent me a new one.  "free."  it was a good idea to get extended parts & labour warranty.) 5. two years later, my hard drive is acting like it's dying.  (bios need an update, i learned on wednesday.) 6. also two years later, my monitor is hanging off the pc because one of the hinges is broken.  (it was a good idea to get extended parts & labour warranty - i have to send my computer to newmarket, on, where they will fix it.  fortunately i don't have to pay for any shipping.) 7. also two years later, my dvd-rom died  again .  i was re-installing windows and had completely re-formatting my hard drive when, lo and behold, my cd-rom wasn' t ever going to read another disk again.  (they will send me a new one, "by tomorrow," and that was told to me last night.  i don't know if my techie overseas really knows the feasibility of getting me the cd-rom by today... since he was a day ahead of me in time....)    hopefully  a new cd-rom and a nice clean install of the os my computer was meant to be with will fix everything.  if not, i might put a penguin on my machine....  (and yes, i do have the purple pads on my computer as well!  :) )

        i'm a unix loser, er, linux user    not entirely out of choice, i have been set up with  redhat linux  on my computer.  it is the preference of my supervisors and i roll with it anyways because (1) it's pretty, (2) after a year or two of this, i can put it on my resume that i'm a moderately adept user, (3) it's a geek thing (not the most  elite geek  thing - i didn't actually install it myself and it  is  only redhat - but geek enough nonetheless), and (4) there are some powerful advantages afterall but i can't sensibly enumerate them (first one that comes to mind is some of my biochemmy tools are available for unix only).  unfortunately,  it is somewhat cramping my style.  by now, i'm used to the terminal window from which i have seamless access to other servers i may access and  mozilla  is a cool browser and i'm the newbiest of newbie  vi  user.  but i haven't a clue where my java compiler is in this environment, can't play a cd (volume control not working) or mp3's (some kind of restriction), don't understand for the life of me how to  xwindows  and work from a different machine, or otherwise really  customize it .  in some cases, it is just as well: i'm prone to getting myself into some sort of  mischief  anyways if i knew too much. :p

        how's this for a "couple commitment"?    over eight weeks ago when chris and i were but a  fledgling couple  (okay, we still are), he signed us up for social dance lessons through parks & recreation halifax (or whatever) for eight weeks starting in september.  he also signed us up for hip hop starting in october for 10 weeks and that is another story altogether....  so, i thought perhaps he was being a bit presumptuous at the beginning of our relationship to commit us to dance lessons together.  i also worried based on seeing my aunt and uncle (~shrug~ 30+ years) dancing at their son's wedding this summer - i figured they got it down only because they are also exceptional at communicating together after thirty years of marriage!  for two people just started dating?  i only envisioned the worse....  above is the picture of the very nice hall in st. mary's boat club where the lessons were held.  fortunately we were the youngest couple there (much less pressure) and the instructor (a suzanne from  edgett international ) was very professional.  her partner, greg, tagged along to most of the sessions but never formally instructed us although he did give helpful pointers and would stop a couple during a song to give on-the-spot instruction.  it was extraordinarily inspiring and helpful to see a couple that performs together showing us what we could achieve.  i'm really proud we made it through all the sessions.  ultimately, we learned the following dances: - the  jive  - single-time - the  social foxtrot  - the  cha-cha  - the  samba  - which apparently means we have also learned the  country waltz  and the  polka  ( little nashville  here we come.  ugh.  that is a really cruddy bar in dartmouth.  well, since it is in dartmouth and probably only old people go there i think it  must  be really lame and cruddy.) - the  waltz   it's nice to have solid rules on how to dance.  it's nice to put the responsibility of choreography on the leader's hands - and that's not me!  however, i learned that perhaps the nice chit-chat you see social dancing couples doing isn't actually pleasant small talk but the girl is reminding (read: nagging) the guy to maintain a  strong lead  and to talk out the upcoming choreography so there aren't any nasty surprises!   "...the man is the head but the woman is the neck, and she can turn it any way she wants...."   these dance clubs have weekly dances that we should attend in order to keep our newly acquired skills.  it's a  whole new world .  (coincidentally, that is the song will and wendy chose as their wedding song they danced to.)  hip-hop, on the other hand, doesn't have rules to follow.  if you can't dance the steps,  feel sexy inside and you will appear sexy and confident on the outside .  it's as simple as that.  it's the most useful thing the instructor has taught us and don't i know it always?  i go clubbing and don the same attitude.  otherwise, the first 20 minutes are a really wicked stretch session for me after wednesday runs.... :p

        it's all greek to me   chris lives near  restaurant district  in halifax so we have had occasion to go to several greek restaurants and wannabe-greek restaurants....  it's been a while since i last reviewed places, no?    so, we went to the  urlLink greek house  a few more times because it was really convenient and, as chris put it, why would we go somewhere that is for "special occasions" when we don't really have the time to relax?  not having to cook and do the dishes afterwards is luxury and treat enough... though i am used to a little more lux.  :p  so... here goes, taste-testing from a pseudo-chinese point of view....  the second time we went to the greek house (i can't remember when), i got a spanakopita (8.95?) that came with a side of greek salad and half a roasted potato.  chris told me about the special way they roast the potatoes.  what can i say?  it's not really seasoned, but it is slightly sour, like pickled.  the spanakopita had extra cheese (besides feta, cottage?  mozzarella?) which made it interesting but i wasn't wholly thrilled.  chris had clam and chips (8.95) and i wanted some!  the next time we went, i was on a healthy kick or something and decided to order greek food instead of a (deep-fried) seafood "entree."  couldn't decide between moussaka (very greek!) or pastitio (which sounded kind of like macaroni and beef like  gwei lo  style).  so i ordered a greek platter (for one?) for 10.95.  it came with a side of greek salad, half a roasted potato, a slab of moussaka, a slab of spanakopita, and a portion of pastitio.  am i missing anything?  oh, and a skewer.  whether it was beef, lamb, pork, or chicken is a mystery to me.  i don't think it was chicken.  but any of the other three...?  it was intensely dry.  spanakopita as above.  moussaka was good though my memory of it is starting to fade.  and the pastitio was hearty - not just boring old  gwei lo -style pasta but something extra - maybe it was in the bechamel sauce that covered everything....  it was a large platter and i ended up giving chris half of nearly all my samples and still being quite full.  the most recent time we were there, i wanted to order stuffed green peppers that is sometimes a special (8.95 for the entree and baklava dessert).  but they were out so i ordered the clam and chips.  yes, it is atypically normal for me to do but it was delightful nonetheless.  a lot of clams for your 8.95.  chris had calamari which he claimed to be made from scratch though they do look suspiciously all uniform in shape....  calamari was served like clam and chips with a bit of tatziki that is better than tartar sauce for either of the seafood.  we topped the dinner off with baklava which was heated and drizzled with extra honey or something and a dollop of whipped cream on the side.  it was really rich and yummy and well-priced for a dessert they had to "prepare" (2.25 or so).    friday night before going to the hallowe'en party, we went to  freeman's little new york  with mike, one of chris' colleagues.  that's a place i've been wanting to try, particularly as a cool kind of wind-down place at 3:30 a.m. after some mad clubbing but i no longer  mad-club  so we went for a benign dinner on a friday evening....  too bad for them (and all restaurants, perhaps) - it was really dead on a hallowe'en friday night.  the waitress was cheerful and a good sport dressed in a skimpy angel outfit to serve us.  we arrived in time to catch the last fifteen minutes of "hungry hour" (which spans from 4:30 to 7:30 on fridays).  we surmise that you get free pizza / mussels / sandwiches if you order something from the bar and since chris did, we were each presented with a small slice of freeman's famous pizza.  it was only pepperoni but really yummy and gourmet!  :)  funny how after all the trips to greek house that there is a greek section to the freeman's menu.  the restaurant tries to emulate a new york city neighbourhood with road signs on the posts of each booth and it manages it quite nicely with a cozy interior.  i suppose that both greek and italian co-exist (with all the others) in new york and they do so as well on the menu.  moussaka, souvlaki, you name it, they have it in their little greek entree section.  they also have pasta and i selected spaghetti and meatballs (8.95) because i wanted to be different.  :p  chris and mike ordered garlic fingers (small), and a large pizza (20.95) that they were so nice to let them split the toppings on: one half had barbecued chicken (typical, chicken pieces with barbecue sauce) and the other half was ragin' cajun (or something, with hot peppers, jalapeno's, peppers, pepperoni, and salsa).  i was pretty much done with respect to dinner after the spaghetti and meatballs.  they were the toughest meatballs known to man, i think, and the sauce was mysteriously dark.  i wasn't wholly impressed - i guess it's the chinese part of me looking for some more  spice  - i have high standards for spaghetti and restaurants rarely meet them.  it was also the sauciest spaghetti i have ever been served (except in a cafeteria) - not very aesthetic.  i didn't try the pizza but they were enormous and apparently good (but ragin' cajun was spicy).  the garlic fingers, albeit a small order, was almost as large as a large pizza.  maybe i would get my own small pizza next time.    finally, most recently, we went to  athens restaurant  because i'm not really that fond of service that gets to know you at a particular restaurant - it makes me uncomfortable and forces me to be socialable to waitstaff... and i was never brought up that way.  athens, of all the greek restaurants in halifax (the only ones missing from this post are spartan and  urlLink opa ), is the most "mediterranean" in feel - the lightest, prettiest greek restaurant thanks to the greece scenery murals.  you know what i'm talking about - azure blue water, white pillars....  reminds me of mr. greek (or the other franchise restaurant) in toronto - near the airport?  can't entirely remember.  it was nice to be somewhere different even if we hadn't ventured far in the ethnicity of food!  they did not have the  octopodi  (charbroiled or pickled octopus, 7.95) so we ordered a feta and pepper dip (6.95) instead.  i orderd papoutsakia dinner (stuffed zucchini, 9.95) while chris ordered the cabbage rolls dinner (9.95).  "dinner" means you have the option of juice or tomato pasta soup - we decided differently and i got juice, because i don't like tomato soup made from ketchup or tomato paste, and not really a  gwei lo -style tomato soup fan.  and with each dinner comes greek salad and roasted potatoes.  while i almost like the greek salad elsewhere, it was really soggy - the lettuce had no crisp being drowned in olive oil for too long.  the roasted potatoes, on the other hand, had the same taste but more enjoyable because it was saucy and sour instead of just dry and sour.  i joked that it was easy to make our dinner because it had the same stuffing, which is probably true.  the stuffing consisted of rice and ground beef.  mine had a slight curry flavour, though.  and then they were cooked in an oven until the zucchini was no longer and very tender (like stewed fuzzy melon :) ).  and the papoutsakia was topped with that mystery bechamel sauce i'm getting used to!  the dinners also came with rice pudding but i'm honestly afraid of that dish - i know it's nice and yummy and sweet - but it's very texture reminds me of what old people eat and i'm not ready for that!    chris suggested we go to dairy queen for dessert but i had a better idea:  urlLink dio mio  for banana split (5.50).  three scoops of your choice, a banana that is split and lain across the sides, and toppings of your choice.  very yummy and gelato=(less eggs and less cream).  there are daily specials at dio mio and in my  banana split mode  i forgot what day it was or else i would have suggested tartufo instead.  the specials go as follows:  monday - 1/2 price affogato (it's gelato with espresso drizzled over it, served with whipped cream and a hazelnut wafer) tuesday - 1/2 price tartufo (choice of rasberry or orange grand marnier center) wednesday - free waffle cone thursday - 2 for 1 smoothies friday - 2 for 1 warm brownie delight saturday - 2 for 1 cheesecake sunday - 2 for 1 sundaes....   :)   freeman's little new york location: 6092 quinpool rd.  athens restaurant location: 6303 quinpool rd.

        i want a digital camera!   i grumbled to my  dearest, favouritest sister  how the chair i put a label on would probably disappear before i actually moved into my new graduate-student-space and she took some measure to make sure it didn't happen, today, at least.  i gave her my access card so she could study in my space after hours and she freaked me out last night saying she hoped that i wouldn't get into "trouble" for something she left on my desk.  trouble?!  already?!  this morning, i got to my desk to find an inflated latex glove on which she wrote with her green sharpie marker:  "wynne's chair"  and all sorts of other garbled grafitti.  there was a box on my desk as well that says something about insulin syringes on the outside and a sticky reading: "look inside for your new friend."  i peeked inside and there was another inflated latex glove with like a smiley face and a label across five fingers:  "mr. glove,"  my new friend.  i wish i had a digital camera because then you could seen the  zany  presents she left me but all i can do is describe it and hope that you found it quite as hilarious and endearing as i did.

        for the record   a computer science party thrown by computer science students attended by computer science students (not exclusively) and held at the computer science building can be a lot (ample) amounts of fun.   naysayers  stand corrected after yesterday/today's hallowe'en party.  (will try to get pics as quickly as possible from all my sources.)

        coming out of hiding   i finally finished  urlLink banana boys  and at the risk of sounding repetitive, i'll mention it this  one more time .  it made more than an impression on me.  for years  joy luck club  has been the closest we (chinese-canadians/americans, asian-americans) have had to describe and make sense of being our visible minority in the west.  and despite being quite heart-warming, it kind of sucked because everyone  lived happily ever after .  the end.  everyone reconciled and there was certain brightness in everyone's future.   banana boys  took me back to my years at waterloo (turns out the author, terry woo, graduated from uw with from systems design engineering... ooh!) with such vivid accuracy i could see my engineering classes (a sea of mostly foreign faces), campus hangouts, and just the general feel.  i don't need to go to toronto for an asian-culture fix, i can just flip to one of the chapters of the book.  (for a asian material fix, that is another story... still need to get out of here.)  and whenever i return from toronto, i'm a bit despondent upon arriving here.  it is so lively and diverse and  go-go-go  there compared to here.  i have to mentally prepare myself for one inevitable day when i won't live in a laid-back city lacking in liveliness, diversity, and  life .  and i always return re-enamoured with, shall we say, fob culture.  the bad i couldn't shake from it: as one of the characters, rick, the one who commits suicide (eek!) saw it, fobs haven't the cultural hang-ups that the banana boys had.  they are worth emulating if you want material success.  the good i will take from it: my issues aren't all rooted in culture, or the lack of.  canadian, and not hk, is the culture of cbcs, really born here cbcs.  and canadian... apparently, is whatever you make of it - whether it's really fobby or the odd chinese tin of fish thrown into an otherwise anglo meal.  it is, apparently, flexible and invariably laced and coloured "canadian" because we drink tim's coffee, for starters, and we live in this country and appreciate it!  i'm reminded that you can spin cbc either really negatively - really messed up, neither chinese nor canadian - or really positively - drawing as much as you want from our parents' (and our own) ultra-rich culture and mixing in canadian to suit your taste.  i'm also reminded that even if the parents are sometimes  soooo  aggravating, (1) it's because they care and that's the only way they will know how to show it and (2) we really do have it better than they did when they first came here.  i holed up for a few days reading that book and now i'm finally ready to come out again.  had to finish the darned book (i really did love it!) before getting on with the rest of my life (like thesis writing!)... slightly calmer.  :)

        does it say  "abuse me"  on my forehead?   it was particularly awful having to work on boxing day (dec.26) and part of it may have had to do with working six consecutive days before that leading up to christmas and the other part very possibly was from a rapidly evaporated christmas spirit on everyone's part.  it's like, "oh, christmas day is over, stop bothering to be nice and in the spirit."  we capitalized on many other restaurants not being open on boxing day by being open and amongst many phone calls inquiring if we are open, i received the following call from a harried sounding woman:  me : "(chorusing) east west restaurant, may i help you?" she: "are you open?" me : "yes...." she: "well, you're like the only one.  do you know anywhere else that is open?" me : "(cheerfully) no! (more snarkily) it's not really a concern of ours." she: "oh... do you have a plan there?" me : "sorry?  what do you mean - a plan?" she: "what do you serve there?  what kind of food?" me : "(very sarcastically)  chinese  food." she: "(distastefully) oh.  okay." (click)  i also had a man who unequivocally blamed me for not taking down this supplement part of his order.  believe me, if i had heard it, i would have because it means $$ (sheesh).  and i may have been flustered at the time and missed the addendum to the order placed by his  wife .  i'm willing to admit blame on me though i know i rarely err when taking orders.  he could have gotten what he wanted but he didn't bother and i said, "i'm sorry.  i may have made a mistake."  and most people would concede there was a small chance they made a mistake as well but not  him  (when it was his wife who placed the order): "you didn't  may have made a mistake .  you made a mistake.  and you should be sorry."  that spoiled my entire evening.  :(   clubs aren't what they used to be   or more likely it's just me....?  i vetoed the dome and she didn't want to go to pacifico so we ended up at  pitchman's pub  (read: kiddy bar, totally lacking in scenery if you know what i mean).  at least pacifico has all this artificial scenery....  i was moderately excited to be going to a club on a few counts:     it's been a while.  it's nice to remind yourself of the scene.  yeah, the halifax scene.  reading  urlLink banana boys  has made me intensely nostalgic for the club scene in toronto  (what i did know of it) and csa (chinese student association) dances at  fed hall .  me and my girlfriend - we were going to be an asian contigent of  two ... and there was no others but us.    anyways, it was a grand disillusionment.  much like going  boxing day shopping  earlier in the day.  it definitely felt like a low when we saw about six girls wrangling over discount table in a situation excaberated by the flimsy garments being all tangled up.  next year i'm catching boxing day sales  online ... but i digress....  not that i wanted a minor to hit on me or anything, but i also give off, "don't touch me, you'll ruin my posture" signals, i'm sure.  the lowest point: a guy came up to me and told me that he and his friend like asian girls.  he checked with me if i'm asian and i responded that i'm  not  so he reeled away only to return in under a minute to explain that his friend's taste is in black girls and to apologize.  i told him that i'm black and he was, like, "really?"  and i admit i have zero sense of humour recognizable by real people and even less of an ability for comebacks so i started to lecture him on the futility (at least in the sense of real relationships) of selecting based on race.   i am such a party pooper.   i met a friend's new boytoy and strangely he reminds me so much of this guy i went out with and who temporarily broke my heart (and made me really upset) that i regret that i cannot be a better friend to support her happiness and look forward to him turning out to be a truly good person.  because the guy he reminds me of wasn't exactly what he seemed.

        who on earth is blogging on christmas?!   uhm, that would be me.... :p  that's because we're winding down a pretty intense workday (while you all had your nice christmas eve dinners).  it was busy at the restaurant which translates into a lot of chatter after the fact.  "do you know something funny about that guy who ordered the 4 house chow mein - that two-hundred dollar order?  they've been having chinese-catered christmas eve parties for fifteen years and been ordering from this restaurant my father worked for fifteen years ago.  this year, that restaurant changed changes and they are getting us to do it for the first time."  (that's a true story!)  hope we started off a nice new christmas tradition with them.  :)  i had a little (okay, he's not so little) helper this year and that made a big difference in my stress level which translates into a lowering of everyone else's stress level just a bit as well.  (thank you!)  oh, and props (or  snaps )  for my sister  who was a lean, mean, take-out order-packing machine.  really.  she was also dressed in green.  so,  merry you all christmas .  i'll definitely be silent tomorrow because it's a family day (and keep in touch with friends by the phone day) for me.

        shoptalk   ahhh... my source of local commercial news is the coast's shoptalk - by the way i haven't read this week's yet!  with our adventures this saturday, my sister and i did our own shoptalk....  her search for a sophisticated christmas present for one of her friends took us to  spring garden place  - a shopping mall sadly overlooked were it not for a roots store that welcomes you as the come in the door (then you can turn around and avoid the old-fogey stores in the center of the mall).  we first hit  the vault  which has all sorts of assorted jewelry.  from gothy pewter jewelry to italian charms to anne klein watches to swatch watches.  they have a step above trinkets to be found on the sidewalk but haven't incorporated gemstones or anything.  i couldn't see myself in most of the stuff there since i guess i'm kind of an  old-fashioned diamonds kinda girl .  ;p  we strolled through  thornbloom  on the upper level which is a delightful haven of high-end (for students!) house and kitchen and bath stuff.  k doesn't get tired walking through stores like that whereas i might be more satisfied strolling through zellers (martha stewart wares!) where i can definitely furnish a house (kitchen) on less!  we didn't really see the point of it but we stepped into the  all dressed up  stores - there is one with more casual outfits (what you would call "dressy casual") and the other has dresses on display.  i saw a really nice  scene  one ($199) but an event is not exactly around the corner for such a pretty dress.  (we noticed that my tastes tend towards this style of dress: lace or felt or mesh overlay over a brightly coloured dress.  k calls it a  titantic dress  - i thought it was kind of  faerie queen .)  the morning shopping wasn't complete without food so we hie to the basement level where we could find little market-style vendors  pastamimi  and  bonne cuisine .  there is a third market that has a nice bakery (good florentines!) but otherwise we didn't check out because that would add too much choice and we weren't up for standard soup and sandwich fare.  between pastamimi and bonne cuisine there was a great selection from quiches, oven-baked pasta, samosa, meatloaf (i think that was what it was), and so forth.  we ordered two grape leaves (0.65 each), vegetarian samosa, and macaroni & cheese (3.99).  the grape leaves weren't all that special but k and i had this weird attraction to it so good thing we kept it at one apiece.  the samosas were okay, not very spicy and k characterized it as a version very westernized to not offend newbie's palates.  the macaroni & cheese was baked and definitely not kd!  haha, it was a bit dry but yummy - we were hungry after shopping.  bonne cuisine also sold dessert amongst which were truffles, creme brul&eacute;, and a fascinating concoction called a  chocolate dome  (3.95?).  we ordered and split one and k claimed she could have had another half and that if she were given a dozen chocolate domes, she would be a happy girl!  chocolate hazelnut mousse lies between two layers of cake where the top layer of mousse is ample and forms a dome that is sprinkled with bittersweet chocolate.  i surmised that we could have chocolate domes everyday if we whipped up some chocolate hazelnut mousse and got angel food cake but k thinks that would be disaster that was advertised by  reese's peanut butter cups  that you cannot just eat the ingredients  separately.  so, it is actually a  synergistic thing .

        cookie exchange   so i wanted to participate in the cookie exchange occurring in my department but (1) i didn't read my email properly and thought it was happening at the end of the day when i would have had to work, (2) i can't bake, and (3) my sister - who would have to do the baking - was reluctant to make several dozen cookies for me.  preparation: 1 hr. baking: 5 min. cooling: 15 min.  cookies ingredients: - 3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened - 1/2 c. powdered sugar - 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract - 2 (1-ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate, melted, cooled slightly  - 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flower - 1 c. semi-sweet mini chocolate chips  frosting ingredients: - 1 c. powdered sugar - 2 tbsp. butter, softened - 1 tbsp. milk - 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract - 2 drops green food colour  drizzle ingredients: - 1/2 c. semi-sweet mini chocolate chips - 1/2 tsp. vegetable shortening  instructions:  - heat oven to 375 o f.  combine all cookie ingredients  except  flower and 1 c. mini chocolate chips in large mixer bowl.  beat at medium speed until creamy (1-2 minutes).  - reduce speed to low.  add flour; beat until mixture forms a dough (1-2 minutes).  stir in 1 c. mini chocolate chips by hand.  - roll dough into 1-inch balls.  place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet.  flatten to 1 1/2-inch circle with bottom of a glass dipped in flour.  bake for 5-7 minutes or until set.  (do not overbake.)  - let stand 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet.  cool completely on wire rack.  - combine all frosting ingredients in small mixer boal.  - beat at low speed, adding milk, 1 teaspoonful at a time, if necessary until frosting is smooth.  frost cooled cookies.  place on waxed paper.  - place 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips and shortening in small microwave-safe bowl.  microwave on high, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth (60-90 seconds).  drizzle thin lines of chocolate over frosting with teaspoon.  let stand until chocolate is set (at least 30 minutes).  yield: 3 1/2 dozen cookies

        the neat thing about interdisciplinary   remember how i was having  urlLink interdisciplinary issues  earlier?  i wondered and wondered if i hadn't made a regrettable and rash decision to do computer science after my biochem undergrad and now it's ever looking like a good decision.  it's still so much harder than i would like but it has an upside....  i totally love applying computer science to my first love, biochem.  i just can't get the passion for computer science purely for the sake of computer science.  i'm just inflexibly biased i guess!  yesterday i had a really great meeting with one of my supervisors who is first and foremost a biochemist but has learned enough math/stats and programming to really express himself.  i love how i get treated like a biochemist even if some days i don't feel like i entirely deserve it.  and later on in the evening i found myself able to switch gears and translate my current problem into purely math terms without distracting chris with latinate species names present in my problem.  and though i don't understand graph theory, it was interesting to realize that that could be the solution to my problem.  gee, if i had known that i would be in evolutionary biology and currently wrestling with these darned trees, maybe i should have considered  graph  theory instead of  game  theory as it would actually help at this point in time??  haha....  i gotta go chat with my supervisor again now.

        i keep forgetting....   how nice and supportive and down-to-earth and fun my supervisor is!  i really wanted to cancel my milestone meeting citing an imaginary emergency or something and i was getting so wretchedly nervous (add that my grad space is unbelievably cold - informal survey confirmed that all other areas are at least 5 o c warmer) but faced it and it was good.  very helpful.  we have to break the meeting to two parts - the second is tomorrow.  he might laugh in my face about wanting to graduate in six months just as we laugh and have a pleasant time in the meeting!

        what is a milestone ?    i have a  milestone meeting  with one of my supervisors tomorrow because i really want to nail down my graduation date and get motivated and i came across  urlLink the dead thesis society  again.  on the principle that i don't want to curse myself i still won't join the email list....  looking at some writing about doing a phd and wondering if that is what i want to do....  "being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves. in the beginning you're  dopey  and  bashful . In the middle, you are usually sick ( sneezy ), tired ( sleepy ), and irritable ( grumpy ). but at the end, they call you  doc , and then you're  happy ." --  urlLink ronald t. azuma   i didn't even finish the above article... what kind of phd student would i make??

        party at ra park   for those not in the know (and i was one of them until last night), ra park is the  royal artillary park .  i drive by it all of the time when passing by citadel hill but never realizaed anything of note would occur in there.  that's where chris' company had their annual christmas party and what a party it was.... :I  haha... well, it's interesting because i had my  urlLink "office" party  two weeks ago and i observed as postdocs arrived with their spouses and i especially observed that the phd student (newer than i am to the lab) brought her steady girlfriend.  another of the phd students arrived alone - perhaps he is single or newly attached or in a long-distance relationship - it wasn't important.  the point is i felt like  operating solo .  if you put me into a group like yesterday, i tend not to draw attention to myself, prefering to reinforce that  wonderful  stereotype of  demure asian girl .  the dinner was really good.  i observed how all the cutlery had the coat of arms (or whatever) except the entr&eacute;e forks, and the china also bore the emblem.  we ate in the officer's mess which is grander than the name would imply (me a newbie to this military scene).  we started off with caesar salad that was just light enough on the dressing.  the main dish was boneless chicken breast in mushroom (?) wine (?) sauce with a side of steamed garden vegetables and a ruffled tower of baked potato.  the chicken was nice and tender and i'm not even a big fan of chicken breast meat.  dessert was new york style strawberry cheesecake garnished with whole strawberries (3) and a chocolate wafer.  (my glass of white wine cost all of 2.50, by the way).  the waitstaff were very professional (reminiscent of white point resort) but unlike white point (which would classify as my most recent "fine dining" experience), the portions were hearty - because they had to feed hungry soldiers!   snowball & december 1st & ra park party.   all i can say is that this has been an unusually festive holiday season so far.  the next function: new year's eve.  (and it doesn't end there but more on that later!)  did you know that i've been back for four years and i haven't done the same thing for any of the new years nor have they been memorable.  i also haven't spent it with my girls either!  so that is the very tentative plan this year.... :)

        yep, i'm a high-maintenance girl....   today i had to get all of my workout gear (yeah, 30-min. run for the first time in two weeks in new - hurty - shoes), all of my daywear clothes, and my evening wear as well.   three  sets of clothes... talk about  high maintenance !  :p  i was pretty paranoid that i had forgotten something vital... like a bra or one of my sandals for the evening (i don't think i have).  i even brought all my (junk) jewelry for ample accessorizing.  tonight is chris' "office party," so that's what the deal is.  otherwise, nothing new or fantastic to note for today!

        parched in the sahara   so, mona and i tried to go to  urlLink cora's  exactly at 12 noon yesterday and the line-up was long!  i wanted mona to try the place and we never figured out how long we would have had to wait - we just left.  it's nice to see that people of halifax have discovered cora's and chose it as their brunch destination on saturdays but i can roughly surmise the speed and quality of service (plus the amount of racket!) when they are especially bustling.    i wasn't opposed to trying  sahara restaurant , an arabic restaurant that was new this summer located in the old san remo's spot on spring garden road.  it has made its presence apparent but piping really loud arabic music to the street all all times it is open - it reminds me of wandering past a hip-hop clothes store on a side street in vancouver and the hip-hop music they blared to desperately attract customers.  the first level of the restaurant (which is above street level) located in a house is the "fast-food" level with a cafeteria-style layout.  the second level of the restaurant is the more formal area with more decor: like pillow slips pinned to the wall, little stools around a round copper/bronze tray that they would use to sit down and drink tea, and there is even a room of sofas draped in colourful embroidered fabric and i wonder what occurs (certainly not eating meals) in there.  a quick glance at the menu (and seeing a dinner as it passed by on a tray) revealed that at least the restaurant wasn't ripping off patrons with  authentic ethnic cuisine  as none of the plates on the menu (it did not say it was only a lunch menu) was greater than $11.99.  mona ordered the sampler plate that i considered: it came with a lamb kofta, chicken shish kebab, and another lamb-thing (can't remember the name given to it!) that was a like a sausage (1 piece) (11.99).  i recently came upon a recommendation to myself (from the  food and hospitality  magazine) to try the shawerma at  urlLink mediterraneo  as they prepare it for 36 hours (or some ridiculously long time) before it is served to you - i may yet try it there since i now know how to eat one!  yes, so i ordered the shawerma chicken (9.99).  for the dinner plates, they all sounded nearly the same to me " meat  with authentic arabic spices" was a very common description.  they also served fatayer (which i should have tried, now that i've looked it up and know it is like spinakopita/samosa, etc.), falafel,  mezza  (dip?), etc.  hurray for mona - she knew exactly how to eat her dinner.  three skewers of meat across basmati rice pilaf and a side of salad that was coriander-heavy (neither of us enjoy that despicable spice!).  she said the chicken shish kebab was tasty.  a piece of pita bread was served across the dinner with a side of  tahini .  boy, has it been a while since i've had that and i polished that off with nice reminiscing of how paul always had a stock of it and we'd add molasses to the  tahini  to make it a sweet-tasting tip.  shawerma chicken (pieces of chicken that are shaved off as the chicken is turning on a vertical spit) was served on "arabic bread."  there was a side of white sauce (not donair sauce), and the server presented us (me) with a bottle of Tabasco sauce.  apparently (from this  urlLink site ), i was supposed to form a pita roll with the chicken, tahini, salad (where was my salad?), and hot sauce.  but to me, tahini was not for putting over meat... so i went the  way-canadian  route and used the knife and fork to eat chicken and rice since the white sauce's use has still not yet been accounted for by the above-mentioned website.  i liked the rice - nice fragrant basmati rice (thanks to a plentiful amount of oil) - which differs so much from our stick-all-together gobs of long-grain white rice.  the chicken was another story since i've never been a fan of barbecued chicken and it tasted very nearly just like that.  (i don't like barbecue sauce so if you do....)  it was all-in-all alright.  sahara restaurant address: 5688 spring garden rd.

        in search for  dan-dan  noodles   there are three places that i have counted that serve up  dan-dan mein : mr. chang's,  urlLink fran's , and  urlLink the hungry chili .  i will not try the one at mr. chang's (~$8.50) for substantiated but otherwise undocumented reasons and my mother tried out the one at fran's so that left the lonely newest addition to be explored.    i even took a half day off work to try it!  (just kidding.)  i took my very gourmand mum to  the hungry chili .  with her discerning eye, she corrected me and told me that there are only 6 four-person tables instead of the seven that i had reported to her earlier.  my discerning eye noticed that the sign saying "cash only" was still hanging on their front door.  i cannot possibly think of a reason why they do not yet have a visa/debit machine.  it's not  necessary  for business but it is certainly convenient for your customer and although the (poor) merchant has to fork over ~3% of a credit card transaction or a flat $0.60 for debit card transactions,  it's just being a good businessperson....   you might be able to see where this review is heading....  i ordered, you guess it,  dan-dan  noodles (8.49).  in the interest of not racking up a big bill, we also ordered a small hot & sour soup (2.99).  you see, one of my supervisors told me the hot & sour soup wasn't what he liked and i wanted to know why.  people make it differently from one chinese restaurant to another and then the vietnamese make it totally differently (but yummy!).  the waitress/hostess/owner ducked into the kitchen after we ordered and we presume that she fixed the meal for us and didn't poke her head out into the dining area until it was ready.   dan-dan  noodles aren't supposed to be served with meat but that seems to be the custom here in order for the restaurants to be able to charge ~$8 per bowl.  took a sniff at it and couldn't make out the smell of any peanut paste or sesame paste.  they used what mum called  yat ka  noodles which are immensely cheap.  to their credit, i don't see what was really wrong with using it - it did not taste bad and is approaching authenticity (in my eyes) because the recipe calls for  ramen  (skinny) noodles.  there were pieces of chicken and the whole broth was spiced with - what else - chili flavour.   big mistake  to leave out the signature peanut flavour.  there was cabbage and ginger in it and ginger has no place in  dan-dan  noodles!  we also learned why my prof was tight-lipped about the hot & sour soup.  it's ingredients included pork (she didn't ask us if we wanted tofu instead), bamboo shoots, green bean vermicelli, tomatoes (say what?  mum says that is an  oy sahn  thing to do.), and some leafy green vegetables.  oh, and they used pickled cabbage, extensive amounts of it such that the juice leaked into the soup and it was truly a  sour  soup.  but hot?  not really.  wholly dissatisfying and nearly inedible.  mum thought something had gone  sook  (which doesn't have an english equivalent except perhaps "sour," as in it has rotted) but i think it was just the pickled cabbage.  she refused to even nibble on it and would rather leave 90% of the food untouched.  hence we were anxious to get our bill and be gone from there.  and we wanted to expense the dining "experience" but to our horror, the bill was presented to us - a list of our two soups on quarter sheet of printing white paper - no restaurant logo,  no officiality at all .  did i also mention earlier how they only accept cash?  this reeks of... anyways, you know what i'm getting at.  it was appalling.  we took the "bill" with us anyhow.   fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice, shame on me.   i had really great and authentic  dan-dan  noodles at a chinese restaurant in  bayview village  that paul took me to (i think).  it was really good and authentic (chockful of peanut paste).  now that mum knows that is what i desire (so that i would try it everywhere), maybe she'll make it and then my search is over!

        the ambition tide   once a week we have lab meetings where i console myself that equally "uneducated" people are in the room - all six of us grad students and lab techs - amongst the ten or fifteen others of superior education (postdocs and professors).  once in a week, i want to get my phd and join the club of smart people.  people who talk and contribute because, perhaps, by that time you either know something or you're no longer afraid to talk in front of people.  like there was a new phd student giving a presentation of her work and i was thinking - maybe i'm blowing my expectations completely out of proportion.  just need to put the nose to the grind and finish the task set before me.  she did it.  and so did everyone else in the room (with the exception of one fellow master's student and a handful of technicians and administrators).   so can i.   and like a tide, for the rest of the week, i just want to finish this degree and be done with school and get a job and be done with school once and for all.

        diet = "diet with a T" II    diet tip #3:  "how to get only half the calories"   i can eat a whole chocolate bar.  i can eat a whole bag of chips and nearly a whole tall tin of pringles.  but fortunately i work in a lab where we love each other and feed each other and mum bought a box of 24 (or was it 48?)  orange aero  bars.  there are 7 pieces in an aero bar (that it's segmented makes it much easier to share... try sharing a mirage bar!) and so i eat only three pieces (while i could so eat the rest) and leave the rest of the bar in the common area - an unspoken agreement that it's a treat for the rest of my labbies.  it's christmas!  it's festive orange-flavoured chocolate!  (i'm such a sucker for orange-infused chocolate: orange aero bars, orange coffee crisp, and orange kit kat bars....)  as for the diet tip of a  urlLink few weeks ago , it was extraordinarily difficult to not get something from a restaurant for a whole week.  we got week on a friday night and didn't want to walk for 20 minutes to a japanese restaurant (light-eating) when we only had then less than an hour to eat.  so we ended up ordering from swiss chalet which is the very opposite of light eating!  the effect was a  maintain  which isn't bad.  i couldn't keep that diet trick up for longer than a week - it's probably easier to follow the first tip ( no junk food ) for extended periods with a short hiatus here or there.  in fact, the week of no junk food made me much more conscious of what i am eating and has leaked into the following weeks.  granted, it's difficult to religiously keep it up through the holiday season but the intent is still there.     listening to: so wing hon's  urlLink dressing room  (1999)  it's a really mellow disk that gets better as it goes along.  there are a handful of really nice duets on the disk including "believe" which he does in japanese with  yuko yamaguchi - it is extraordinarily nice!!  there are a couple of goofy and fun tracks here and there he does with LMF.  reading:  urlLink the picador book of contemporary chinese fiction  my concentration span isn't long enough for a novel so short stories (they are really chinese, translated to english, so it's a bit rocky reading) are perfect size to digest.

        hamachi - mmm - house   so i finally made it to  urlLink hamachi house , again, for the first time in months.  we tried to go to  urlLink sushi shige  but what day do they find fit to be closed at lunch-hour but on monday.  after careful deliberation, i ordered a small tempura udon (5.95) and scotia rolls (6.50) while chris ordered a bento box II (9.95) and lobster maki (5.50).  i think they are thrilled to get two  a la carte  orders because then they could be presented together on a little sushi tray and appear to be plentiful.  that is, we were served as appetizers the 6 pieces each of scotia rolls and lobster maki.  scotia rolls are hamachi special rolls (i.e., contain a combination of fish and have unique-to-the-restaurant names) containing salmon, shrimp (cooked), caplin roe, and cucumbers.  some of the rolls had larger pieces of salmon (therefore yummier!) but i tasted mostly a mouthful of cucumber... which isn't altogether bad.  lobster in lobster maki is cooked and mixed with a bit of mayo and rolled with lettuce.  it's like a little lobster salad.  when you can taste the lobster it is fragrant but sometimes it didn't seem as if the lobster was everpresent in the roll.  can you tell i'm not totally thrilled?  i guess i still like salmon or tuna or scallops with or without spicy sauce best.  chris' bento box contained tempura (4 pcs. - one each of shrimp, sweet potato, zucchini, and eggplant), teriyaki chicken (choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp), a japanese side salad, and sushi (3 pcs. california rolls, 1 pc. salmon nigiri, and 1 pc. i-dunno-what-fish - it was dark - nigiri).  for 9.95, it's a  very nice  combination.  i was pleased that they are back to using real udon noodles and i was given a dish of special spices, a half-teaspoon of which was plenty to heat up my tongue.  i was also served with tempura (the same assortment of four pieces) and  it was comfort food in a serious way .  :)  chris offered me his salmon nigiri (can't help it, i'll eye enviously slabs of raw salmon fillet at the supermarket) and it was a small piece of heaven.

       blogger was down when i tried to log on yesterday so - watch out - there's a lot of stuff for today!   hair  die  dye    i did something that not many young chinese girls do: i dyed my hair... black.  my caramel blonde highlights had grown out so they started around my temples and that was a serious  faux-pas  so i got me clairol nice'n'easy "natural black blue" (i'm such a product placement babe) and spent an hour yesterday evening becoming  really chinese  again.  there is something  freaky  about dying your hair: along with new hair colour comes a new personality.  i became a regular  tigress  after getting all-round blonde highlights put in two summers ago.  now i feel like i have to be reserved... very  fresh off the boat ... "what's hair dye?"  i bet no one's going to notice in the real world except for anyone who also reads this.  :p     shopping fix    mona and i went shopping on saturday night because where was no tax at most shops and the malls were open until midnight.  i love gift-giving and i'm thrilled to have snagged jpg's from  urlLink the gap  and  urlLink american eagle  - so i can remember what i have gifted so as to not gift too similarily next year  :p  because there are a couple of guys that  i love to dress those guys up  and i have this insane desire to post pics of my great taste but i'll just post a picture of runners i got....   half-life for runners?   i didn't know that running sneakers have a "lifetime."  it is somwhere between 350 and 550 miles depending on how much money you have to replace runners and how prone you are to injury.  (i thought i would be looking for visible signs of wear and tear but my year-old adidas response' are completely intact on the surface.)  which means i had to sit down last week and figure out how many miles i have put onto my runners for the past year, entailing some painstaking sifting through this year's agenda and last year's calendar (yes, i do keep track of all this stuff!) to find that between september last year and today, i have run  ~450 miles  and i actually got these runners before last september.  what can i say,  go me !   :)    not so  go me    my comments have been  kaputt  for a few days now.  not that i expect any but it feels very empty without the link following my posts.   listening to....   aaron kwok's "in the wind" from, like, 1998.  (it is so damn  old  that it is not being sold at my favourite asian music site, so i can't link to it).  track 1 is an mbanx (remember that?) theme song and track 3 samples some indian music.  haha, we beat  beyonc&eacute;  to it (2003).  track 7 is a nice ballad, kind of dated sounding but sooo soothingly aaron.   urlLink singing your way to fluency  sounds like a really good idea and i have  two  mandarin songs in my repertoire (both are a-mei cheung, go figure).  i learned those about four years ago and have been too lazy/inept to expand my repertoire.  hey, whatever works, right?  some people learn from watching movies in a foreign language....  haha, i'm tiring myself from these topic switches.  i'll sign off with another post (aa reading, below) that's been hanging around waiting for me to find all the links and now it is complete!

        winter reading... heavy on the 'aa'  urlLink      not only do i support  urlLink asian american film , but i also try to get my hands on as much asian-american literature as possible.  it must have been ten years ago when i read  urlLink runaway: diary of a street kid  that was so enticing because she was a repressed child and ran away (fantasy) and lead a really taboo lifestyle.  went to chapters on tuesday with mona where i couldn't resist the nice cover for  urlLink inside out: reflections on a life so far  (click the image for a larger view).  incidentally, it was written by evelyn lau who is not unknown to me as an author.  conveniently it was not $25 but $5.  it is a collection of essays reflecting on the big issues in her life so far (she's only 30!).  mona picked up vikram seth's  urlLink a suitable boy  which by the sounds of it is a super-size version (it's like 1,000 pages!) of amy tan's  urlLink kitchen god's wife  that i grudgingly like.  she also got  urlLink born confused , targeted for a younger reader but addressing an issue that i wish there was a chinese version of it!  (come to think of it, the indian version might suffice to some extent but if i really wanted to, i would just reread,  the joy luck club .)  i ordered terry woo's  urlLink banana boys  and  urlLink the chinese have a word for it  which should arrive shortly at my door.  :)  rounding out my collection of  cultural reading : - amy tan's,  urlLink bonesetter's daughter  - ding cong's  urlLink wit and humour in modern china  - da chen's  urlLink china's son: growing up in the cultural revolution  -  urlLink asian values, western dreams  - the history of hong kong in  urlLink a borrowed place  - stephen haw's  urlLink a traveller's history of china  - arthur golden's  urlLink memoirs of a geisha   straying away from stuffy british novels, since it was inducted into oprah's book club and since it's a classic instead of a modern novel, i also want read john steinbeck's  urlLink east of eden .  i might not enjoy it at all so i'll probably borrow it from the library before committing and buying it.

        what is fluency? ( urlLink link )   people (i mean first generation immigrants) are 'surprised' that i speak my parents' first language.  is it because they've encountered too many second-gen'ers like myself who have thick (incomprehensible) accents and, even worse, who refuse to see the importance of learning the language.  i know i'm not good - real hong kongers don't really understand me.  and many of those first-gen'ers have children who have  'gone back home'  or otherwise could kick my ass in spoken chinese.  i know where i  am  good is the fact that i can read and write.  (here's my cry of self-pity:) reading and writing can be learned without little chinese friends, as i had none growing up.  unfortunately, those more fluent than i don't seem to exhibit regret that their reading/writing is not up to par becasue, correctly, they think  spoken communication is king .  i ask this because i realized that my spoken 'fluency' can be described as follows:  - unable to hardcore swear - fluent in really biting comments - no jargon - no newscasts - 75% of movies and television - no affectionate displays of emotion  (i scored 40% on the fluency test linked above)  i will be using as much as my mother my gift to her for christmas: a  urlLink shortwave radio  capable of receiving chinese radio stations in toronto.  ***  on monday i was waiting at dalplex and i saw a chinese woman playing with her little daughter.  i had to strain my hearing to hear her speaking to the child in chinese and i wondered if her caucasian husband understood a word of what the mother was teaching the child, if the child would be fluent in chinese until she goes to school and all that education is put on the back-burner.  it will be my instinct to speak in english to my child but for starters, i'll have to dredge my memory for all the endearing chinese terms used upon me, like  sum ohn ding  ("sweetheart" or "darling") and  soh juu  ("crazy pig"... which is kind of endearing).

        best . party . ever   i don't do house parties.  it's strange to say and my girlfriends and i tend to go out for eats or clubbing rather than invite people over.  that and i don't have a  pad  of my own to host anything.  (wish i did.)  and the house parties i have been to... boring.  based on my projecting silly high school girl illusions it seemed that the house parties i have attended were centered around the drinks.  then there was the party i attended with english majors and i left fairly quickly.  plus, i've never been to one where i knew enough people that i could just insert myself into different groups.  there was a classy kind of intoxicated air (from wine, not beer or hard liquour) and conversations with pretentious threads i could relate to - like where is the best dining in halifax.  :p  i think people being happy (it's the holiday season) and not entirely sober and that we were all so  elegantly dressed and grown-uppy  gave me more confidence that i could hold my own.  after several tries, i still couldn't do a drunken fest and can't understand how people my age still do.  skipping straight to the adult version is just fine by me.  :)

        it's...... december 1st!    which means there's going to be a  small office party  tonight.  a  soiree , shall we say.  my supervisors rock and one of them has parties to so his international postdocs feel at home - like a midsummer festival when there was a contingent of swedish researchers in the lab and this year he held an american thanksgiving potluck for the american postdocs now in the lab.  the  december 1st party  is "formal," i.e., wear your best gear that usually lurks in the back of your closet.  oooh, this is gonna be fun! :)   listening to....    urlLink ultra chilled 01 (disk one)   if i had lots of $$, i would buy the whole set (and cover up all the album covers because they are getting increasingly risqu&eacute;!)  -  urlLink ultra chilled 02  -  urlLink ultra chilled 3  -  urlLink ultra chilled 4

        f5   on the latest episode of american idol (i am shamelessly watching season three from the top),  one contestant looked like he was going to get to go on but he displayed a lack of brain (and it wasn't just nerves) when posed this same question.  so it's not really fair to have had advanced notice of it....  you have just won one million dollars:     who do you call first?   my sister.  but she's awfully hard to get a hold of.  then my mum.  we wouldn't work for the rest of the day.  i'd put the ticket stub (or whatever) into a plastic bag and k suggests we tape to our thigh.  we were talking about this last night because the super 7 this week is $30,000,000!  ....but i'm not a gambling person.   what is the first thing you buy for yourself?   everything on my fledgling  urlLink wish list .  it wouldn't amount to that much anyhow.   what is the first thing you buy for someone else?   probably something my sister really wants.  and shortly after the house for my parents!   do you give any away? if yes, to whom?   to my parents, only, unfortunately.  it's  only  a million dollars!   do you invest any? if so, how?   whatever is leftover.  into a diversified mutual fund portfolio ( duh )  not  managed by me!

        daily playlist   this is what i'm listening to lately ....  call it  thesis kick-start  music... because things are looking  up .  :)    vanessa mae's  bach street prelude .  this old  urlLink post  describes my impression of the entire album, storm, and how it is actually appropriate for jogging music.   baby cat , upbeat kelly chen song from  urlLink album  of the same name  ayumi hamasaki's  seasons , quite easily one of her best songs.  okay, so i don't follow her music and this song only came up to me because of a very good recommendation.  :)  this song,  if it snowed on taipei  that i downloaded, like, six years ago and it is not possible (even for me) to figure out who the artist (female) is.  it is magnificently beautiful.  most beautiful song before 2003.   white flag , first single from dido's latest album.  alas, only the first two singles are notable....   i believe , the most beautiful song in the world (after 2003), currently, a duet in japanese done by william so wing hon and i-can't-remember-her-name   when i'm in the wind , a really nice r&b track on alex to's "believe" album   em di xem hoi trang trong , the vietnamese folk song we danced to last year at multicultural... it makes me want to get up and dance and demurely shake my booty :p   can't tell you  by one of my favourite female hk artists, karen mok, tune sounds like cher's "it's in his kiss," from the  urlLink disney 100  cd....  cantonese version of  circle of life    weird , the nifty tribal tune that is, alas, the best song on stephanie sun yan zi's  urlLink album .  it can really stir up your basic desire to move and shake it.   love has no borders , the most adorable jazzy duet done by nicholas tse and grace yip.  i'm not sure which disney movie soundtrack it came off, though.

        at least get a pedometer    i'm proud to say that with my first week back to running, i logged  fifteen miles .  just think, 15 extra miles traveled that weren't necessary, per se, and i squeezed it into my routine.  i know, i know, results aren't instant.  (oh, they so aren't.)  i'll be really hard on myself if i still hate it after a month.  i wonder how many  urlLink steps  i take during a day.  probably not even 4,000!  i'm such a sedentary freak.  wearing a pedometer sounds like a really neat idea but i'm not sure i want to quantify my life any more than i do  if  i am otherwise active (run 5 times a week, etc.).  neat "office" tricks i practice... i wonder what it amounts to anyways.... 1. never take the elevator in my four-floor building. 2. ascend one floor to use the washroom (they are cleaner anyways). 3. descend one floor to obtain water from the fountain (the water is colder anyways).  if i drink lots of water (good practice), then i will have to wonder the floors of my building several times every day!

        what gets me really (really) mad   well, it gets my parents really mad which in turn makes me mad....  once a year (in time for our restaurant's anniversary), we have a promotion that goes something like this (paraphrased): "buy one combo for $7.75 and get the 2nd for $0.99.  includes: egg roll, chicken fried rice, sweet & sour chicken."  there are limitations listed in finer print like "take-out only.  valid dd/mm/yyyy until dd/mm/yyyy.  excluded fri. & sat. 5-8 p.m.  coupon required."  what do you make of that?  over the years we have had some wacky interpretations.  ....like the customer who brought in a photocopy of the coupon.  sorry, but most people knew that they should be bringing in the original.  we cannot afford to have people making unlimited copies of the coupon.  you can only get as many special offers as you have original coupons.  buy more copies of the paper!  it's worth the discount!!  (maybe the fine print should read, "present  original  coupon required.")  ....like the customer who thought that they could use the one coupon to get several deals, that is, three $7.75 dinners and three corresponding dinners for $0.99 each.  most people did not interpret the coupon as such either....  (maybe the fine print should read, "only one special per coupon.")  ....like the customer who asked me if we had more coupons she could use.  uhm, no.  it's not like we get free food from a supplier that we  pass on for free or something.  we still have to cook the $0.99-meal and every year we take a severe loss in the name of promotion.  ....we always get a few customers who didn't read closely and thought they could get the special served to them in the dining room.  sorry, no such luck.  people don't usually have problems interpreting that they get an identical second combination dinner for only $0.99 because they bought the first one full price.  and people usually accept that they cannot substitute beef fried rice for the chicken rice nor can they get something equivalent to chicken balls.  because it's a  special .  (they can make all sorts of crazy changes on regular menu items.)  (maybe the fine print should read, "no substitutions!... except the egg roll.  and the second dinner is the same as the first."  sheesh.)  but one customer on wednesday (our chinese new year's eve no less!) made the biggest fuss of them all.  i wasn't there but the conversation went like follows:  lady: can i get meat egg rolls instead for the combinations. mum: yes.  [it's $0.25 extra for each.] lady: for the combinations, can i have beef fried rice instead of chicken? mum: no.  there are no substitutions for the advertisement. lady: why not?  can't you just make a different rice when you're making it.  [so she assumed correctly that we make rice specially for each order.] mum: yes, but this a special.  we get many of these coupons and we can't make these changes.  it will get too confusing, so no substitutions.  [except the egg roll types.  you have to give them a choice on that one.] lady: do you have soo guy on your combinations? mum: we have soo guy on our combination 10 and 11. lady: but i don't want the broccoli.  [referring to our combination 10 consisting of egg roll, rice, beef & broccoli, and soo guy] mum: [points to our combination 2 that is identical in contents and price to the special, but comes with a fortune cookie as well] we make a substitution to this combination. lady: okay, i'll take that. mum: [ringing in the special and a modified combination 2] that will be $1-.--. lady: why is it so much?! mum: you have the special for $7.75 and the additional one at $0.99 and $0.25 for each meat egg roll and $8.25 for the combination 2 with soo guy. lady: i didn't want three dinners!  it's just for two people! [sneering] do you think we're pigs? mum: no- lady: you think we're pigs!  i want the combination with soo guy as the second dinner, for $0.99. mum: the second combination has to be like the first one, no substitutions. lady: why?! mum: it is a special. lady: you don't let me do this or that.  no  wonder  there's nobody here. [gesturing to our, alas, tranquil dining room.  it's a weekday night and it's the dead of winter.] mum: you're asking too much! [unfortunately mum's command of english leaves something to be desired and she really meant, "you're asking  for  too much!"] lady: i'll take the special the way it is then! [grumbling] i don't usually come here, now i know why.... [and thankfully, to our rescue, three other understanding take-away customers entered to invalidate her very low-brow comment, "no wonder there's nobody here."]  not to play the racism card or anything but sometimes we think that some customers wouldn't be such a bully if facing a caucasian person who can speak perfect english....

        happy new year!  happy tet!   xin nian kuai le!     mum made holiday treats as she did in new years passed.  they are like deep fried "dough sticks" ( yao tiu ), only crunchier.  when she had the time, she used to stuff them with sugar, toasted sesame, and ground-up peanuts.  (without the fillings these treats are called  ma fa , like "sesame flowers," or something.  with the filling, they are called,  goch zai , meaning "little corner treats.")  the bigger feast is the one enjoyed by family on new year's eve, while that enjoyed on new year's day is a bit more modest.  we will have hard-boiled eggs to  mai lahn , meaning to get rid of our  lahn , laziness.  and we always have chicken for some reason.  mum started a tradition following her mother's example in eating vegetarian meals on new year's day.  i will probably follow that tradition later!  my esl tutoree, david, told me about how back home (he just visited), they would lay out an offering for the ancestors including rice, chicken, wine, and water.  they would pray a lot and burn spiritual money so the ancestors may use it in the other world.  even his parents partake in this ritual but he said he wouldn't initiate it for himself.  our generation is a lost cause, huh?  he also told me of gifting  gum gut  trees which are bear clementine like fruit.  mum says,  dai gut, dai lay , meaning "big clementine, big prosperity."  (you can tell by now that i'm racing between computer and kitchen to gather this info??)  he said that you also gift  tofa  trees: they are supposed to bring you luck in love in the coming year!  i washed my hair this evening because it's bad luck to do it on new year's day: we are superstitious that we would be washing away some good luck with the dirt!  neither are we supposed to sweep the house (or otherwise clean the house, i suppose).  tomorrow i'm going to wear socks with paul frank-esque monkeys and a martial arts-inspired black shirt with frog clasps.  yup.  once again, happy new year,  sun neen fai lok !

        i hate running   i hate running.  or something.  it is so desperately boring on a treadmill looking down at the timer every half a minute for 48 or more minutes watching time go by.  i swear time slows down when i go running!!  i watch movies that we have at home.  (we don't have that many.)  i can't watch television because we don't have cable (yet) and the image would just suck.  oh well, i can and have watched  urlLink anne of green gables  over and over again... (i think i've watched it 40 times since 1985... or more).  i think i will watch it tonight for my 72-minute excursion....  i just started up with ~4 miles (supposed to be 6) on sunday and 4 yesterday.  it was brutal.   :(   today i have to run 6 and then 4 tomorrow before enjoying a break on friday.  a one-day break is  not  long enough.  just like when you run intervals of 10 minutes and have a 1-minute break.  oh boy does that minute go by amazingly fast!!  but... my life has become extraordinarily sedentary and that is a  big  problem.  at least running is kicking me out of being a  lazy sloth  that i would normally be so... here goes.   #1 world's worst programmer   everyone outta the way - that prize is for me only.  like any biochemist, i can download and set up biochemmy programs on my  black-box-to-me  linux box.  but have me download an open source program for cs-er's and i'm toast.  it didn't run.  for the most mysterious reasons to me.   thank goodness for google.   because with mona's suggestion i googled the error message and found people who had posted to a forum of some sort with the same problem and i sifted through responses to those problems.  sometimes i don't understand the solution that someone posted... so i look around for an easier solution.  or sometimes i follow the solution to the best of my ability, cross my fingers, and hope that it was adequate....  and when i write the simplest itty-bitty-est program.  it doesn't work on the first try.  ever.  in this light, i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to do with myself when i actually get to be done here....

        you might as well do it all the way....   we went for a  treat  yesterday.  :)  dinner at  urlLink hamachi house .  with eyes a bit bigger than our stomachs, i ordered beef sashimi (6.00) and a large tempura udon (8.50).  chris ordered octopus nigiri (2 pcs., 5.50) and "the boat" (15.95).  now you would wonder at this time if you should be eating raw beef but i threw caution into the wind and i'm still alive and feeling well.  :P  it was a really nice platter with four strips of beef and five "rosebuds" consisting of 1.5 strips each presented in a small pool of soya-like sauce and some tobasco-like topper.  it was divine and quite worth your $6, i am of the opinion.  after all, it was like having a small steak for your appetizer!  "the boat" came with 6 pcs. of assorted nigiri (salmon, tuna, shrimp, and three others, all different and none of which were octopus), 6 pcs. california rolls and a fatty tuna hand roll that chris enjoyed.  and i learned the the large udon really is larger than the small (5.95) by coming with a large bowl of udon noodles in broth and tempura: sweet potato (4 pcs.), and one pc. each of zucchini, eggplant, and shrimp.  i really like how they give you tempura dipping sauce (not all places do) on the side.  we wrapped things up with banana tempura (5.00) which was about half a banana fried in tempura batter and served with a small scoop each of green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, and ginger ice cream.  i wonder if these are just  fabricated, crock desserts  for westerners who want to end an asian meal with something sweet analogous to how authentic (not) fortune cookies are to chinese cuisine.  regretfully either the bananas were really soft before being fried or the batter isn't very protective, but i did not enjoy it as much as i would have liked.  the spring roll skin-wrapped bananas were better....  it seems somewhat paradoxical to say that we were stuffed after a japanese meal but we were!

        first go the thighs, and then go the toes   it dawned on me suddenly yesterday morning why we in the atlantic region are said to have entered the  "deep freeze"  with our sub -30 degree (celsius) weather.  the chill hits your bones as quickly as it did when i had to stick my hand into the minus-70 freezer to rummage for dh-alpha  e.coli  cultures.  them were the good old days of....  dronedom .  this past evening i was armed to the teeth with winter gear but was inhumanely left to wait for a transferring bus for twenty bitterly freezing-cold minutes close to midnight when i usually don't have to wait at all all because the right bus (mine) would break down on its way to my stop on the second coldest night of this winter season.  in fact, my beloved mp3 player seemed to feel the freeze as well.  actually, it did freeze.  gee... paul... though it started up again, i hope it's still under warranty if it dies of frostbite....  :p   bundle up everybody!   (i am keenly aware of who doesn't practice appropriate bundling-up.)  that means hat, scarf, and mitts... and if they co-ordinate, all the better!

        good things come in small packages....   i was feeling quite lithe in my new pair of black overall pants last week when it hit me -  i am complete .  oh no, this isn't a deep, soul-searching entry... not at all.  it's just that i was hit with one of those rare moments where i feel that i - standing  4-feet-11-and-a-half-inches  - am an a-ok person.  everything that anyone could want fits neatly into this little frame.  if i was less lazy, i'd be physically strong.  what i am capable of learning and feeling and experiencing, knocks me over.  particularly since i'm so short.  doesn't taking up 5-feet-6-inches (and the ensuing width and depth) of space seem like such a waste now?  but you know what?  i would have had to journey down the dark side and consider that wouldn't it be awesome to be this complete and, like, 20 lbs. lighter?  it's like packing the same punch with a smaller package... like  ultra tide .  this is my motivation.  ultra tide.  (this comes on the heels of gaining two pounds since the beginning of this month.  that is depressingly bad, i might add, because (1) it's a larger proportion for me than it is for most of you and (2) i wear kinda fitted clothes so a pound - and especially two! - changes everything.)

        back into the game   k and i were watching  sports  last night.  hehe.  yesterday night was  "a great night in [men's] figure skating" .  yup, it has been a while since i have sat down and watched an entire competition.  i watched the women's long program and men's short, then the men's long last night.  it's really quite breathtaking when everyone rises to the occasion, feels rather than falls to the pressure that is skating for the  canadian crown .  and when you watch the canadian championships, you realize why we figure as a skating power on the world stage.  you think that these people have what it takes to make it at the worlds (in march).  on friday, a new women's champ was crowned in cynthia phaneuf.  it turns out the nary 16-year-old will not be representing canada at the senior world's because she has not yet had even junior world experience.  the representatives for canada will be joannie rochette and jennifer robinson, both of whom display impressive maturity and grace under fire.  yesterday, emmanuel sandhu defended his title against jeffery buttle and ben fereira who have been on his tails the entire time.  actually, ben wasn't really a contender except he had an awesome free skate that no one except sandhu could touch so he kept his silver position (he has only been able to achieve third-place at nationals thus far).  after watching a nationals, there is always a great feeling of hope that we cruise on into worlds.... can't wait!  (i make a lousy sports reporter, huh?  better to stick to blogger.  :p)

        song running through my head   there's this little reality show called  newlyweds  that is quite endearing.  just watch it to see why, but here is what i think....  soap operas and dramas are scripted and come out corny.  there is no such thing as ever-lasting love.  maybe some stuff has been edited in this  newlyweds  show but what comes out is just really sweet and down-to-earth.  supposedly we are watching them really love each other really living their lives.  both of them have their dumb moments and that makes them all the more loveable.  you end up rooting for them through it all.  then i saw jessica simpson on oprah and she sang her song  with you .  i don't know if it's really any good on its own but i like it.  here is the beginning of the song:  the real me is a southern girl with her levis on and an open heart wish I could save the world, like i was super girl the real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love but lately i've been jaded life got so complicated  i start thinking about it almost forgot what it was like do you know what it feels right? cause with you i can let my hair down i can say anything crazy i know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground with nothing but a t-shirt on i never felt so beautiful baby as i do now now that i'm with you with you now that i'm with you

        quickie reviews   been to a few places recently....    may garden   ( mei yuune ) - dec. 31, 2003  we had a stake in the restaurant,  tung hing  that occupied this spot until last year when the business was sold and may garden moved in.  you could say i grew up half in that restaurant and half at the mall where our  manchu wok  fast food restaurant was located.  i had not been to the restaurant in many years - five, ten? - so it was slightly nostalgic (but i didn't share this) to see how it hadn't changed visibly from what i remember as a child.  the hostess was one of the leftovers from the changeover.  her daughter is near my age and was my little chinese friend back then but we never met up after i stopped hanging out there.  it's not like we went to the same school....  we went on new year's eve on an espionage kind of trip.  they are a  new  restaurant to that location (another one in bedford) but they had a built-in customer base from the old restaurant.   we  had  to find out for ourselves what their food is like.  we ordered three "special egg rolls" at 1.70 each, ginger beef (8.95),  goo loe  pork (8.95), "chinese shrimp omlette" ( waht dahn ), and fried rice noodle with beef.  k and i guffawed at the size of the egg rolls.  they were really super-size, like eight inches long.  we passed on the "egg roll" (filled with ground pork and onion, 1.25) and the "vegetable egg roll" (filled with vegetables including bean sprouts, 1.50) for the "special egg rolls" purported to contain shrimp, chicken, and vegetables.  the shrimp were tiny but i guess that is appropriate and otherwise i couldn't really tell what else went into the egg rolls - the bean sprouts lend a kind of dank taste to the egg roll overall.  of the dishes we ordered i liked the "chinese omlette" which may turn you off because it looks like a cross between scrambled eggs and porridge.  how i wish mum would actually make this dish instead of scrambled eggs!  the "chinese omlette" is excellent on rice and i liked it despite it being laced with onions and a tad bit overgreasy.  the shrimp was substandard (not deveined, not particularly crunchy) but it is the perfect ingredient to "chinese omlette."  (this dish could only be found on the  chinese menu .)  the fried rice noodles with beef was okay as well.  it was a bit greasy but that can be expected (and accepted?) for that dish.  i thought there was a bit too much soya sauce but otherwise it was okay.  (i learned it was prepared by a friend of mine who hails from hk!)  onto the lesser items....  i had a morsel of ginger beef.  the beef was okay.  the sauce was insanely sweet.  it  should  be sweet with a hint of ginger.  there was no hint of ginger in the least bit and the sauce appeared and almost tasted like maple syrup.  it was odd and very, very wrong.  i don't like  goo loe  pork so i didn't try much except a morsel of pork.  it was served with pineapples and peppers and you could call it "authentic sweet & sour."  it was the right taste as far as i could tell but i guess i got lucky - they reported the pork tasting funny and the peppers had gone bad.  i felt slightly loved there... ha!  like julia roberts in the beginning of  urlLink my best friend's wedding  surrounded by waitstaff waiting on our pronunciation of verdict on the food.  i hadn't seen edmund in, like, two years and was thrilled to know he is still in town.  he told us that chinese people prefer the duck dish from the chinese menu so i may try it later....?  address:  downtown dartmouth on portland street   mike's restaurant  - jan. 3, 2003  andrew and i were driving around bedford on saturday embarking on something different: hanging out in bedford!  there are a great number of restaurants to choose from there: the cellar bar & grill has a 2 nd  location there,   urlLink il mercato  has a 2 nd  location there, as does also  urlLink hamachi steakhouse ... i believe.  to wit, bedford is an affluent area with nice restaurants and i would go there more often... only if i lived there.   we decided upon mike's restaurant in bedford place mall, one of the scummier malls.  i thought, "yeah, my first time dining in bedford in ages and we are at a real live bedford restaurant."  but as we were perched in our booth and flipping through the menu, my mind was being changed.  the menu is so brilliantly glossy with life-size full-colour pictures of pizzas, pastas, and shish kebabs.  (i was thinking, "maybe this isn't a bedford roadhouse restauarant....."  click the link to get to their website.)  not only that, they had an extensive menu with sandwiches, burgers, sauteed pasta and normal pasta, sunshine-shaped gourmet pizzas and normal pizzas, shish kebab, steak....  the surf & turf  brochette  (their fancy word for shish kebab) had a picture so brilliant i had to order it (14.99) while andrew ordered a 12 oz. new york sirloin (16.99).  we also ordered mozza sticks (8 for 4.99, served with this ranch dressing, gross).  the problem with having such brilliant pictures... is living up to them.  my  brochette  arrived slightly different-looking from the picture.  it was much more charred.  the plum tomatos (2) were really mushy, the chicken (2 pc.) really dry.  the girl forgot to give me sauce for dipping.  the two shrimps and 1 scallop were just fine as was also the piece of beef (medium cooked).  the roasted vegetables were okay and so was the rice pilaf that didn't look quite so brilliantly yellow as in the picture!  we ordered dessert: andrew ordered a brownie eruption ("our own creation", 5.99) and i tried to order a tiramisu (4.49) which they ran out of so i got "the crisp" (an apple cobbler, i'm such a senior citizen, 3.99).  the dessert menu is brilliant with a picture of each dessert.  we were bowled over by the size of andrew's dessert - it would impress anyone while mine was nice and normal.  :p  overall, not a bad place at all.  lots and lots of selection... just might not look exactly as the picture (the desserts we ordered live up to expectations, though).  i looked around me while andrew was away for a few minutes.  it has the air of a country kitchen except it is a large restaurant.  you could say the servers were really well trained or they have a serious misconception of what constitutes as "good service," as i was always refered to as "the lady" while andrew was "the gentleman."  and  every time  our server walked by enroute or after serving the neighbour table she asked us how we are doing.  it was a bit too much.  address: 1658 bedford highway (in bedford place mall)   t.g.i. friday's restaurant  - jan. 5, 2003  i remember going to boston when i was in grade ten (that was, gasp, 10 years ago!) and we were all about going to t.g.i friday's on newbury street.  we went twice during our five-day trip.  so you could say that i have been there before and didn't need to retry it.  some people say it's overpriced but i'm glad to have gone again with chris (his first time) and have my belief readjusted.  i don't like the decor.  the red-checked table-vinyls offend me.  we started with cheddar cheese nachos (6.99) and i ordered mushrooms steak mushrooms (14.99) and chris got jack daniels steak (17.95).  the nachos were loaded with cheddar (yum) but i wasn't pleased that the dipping sauces provided were very  biased .  that is of the heart-clogging sauces (guacamole and sour cream), they gave you ice cream scoops of it while the heart-sensible salsa you are provided but an ounce of it.  that's okay, i couldn't eat too much salsa anyways - there was coriander in it.  we were heartily pleased with the large portions of the entrees.  we got loaded potatoes which were dis heart eningly soaking up cheddar cheese,  bacon , an ice cream scoop each of butter and sour cream.  there were plenty of sauteed vegetables (string yellow and green beans, baby carrots, and red peppers) and the steaks were appropriately cooked to the right degree (medium).  chris' looked really thick and juicy to boot.  i was provided with a thinner and smaller steak that had been topped with sauteed mushrooms and mozzarella cheese while grilling.  i was also provided with four mushrooms dipped in cheese batter and deep-fried.  (suffice it to say that i scraped off the batter.)  you could also go there solely for dessert or their  ultimate  blended drinks... hmmm....  :)   additional perk of dining at friday's: getting a chance per dinner guest to pull at the $1,000,000 slot machine.  (yeah... obviously we did not win!)  address: 1983 upper water street   canna fix this blog   i want my comments back.  not that i get comments, but i like to have the  option  to get 'em.  it would require resetting this template but, alas, blogger does not have a convenient "reset to default template" button and this particular template that i am quite fond of can no longer be found on their list of templates.  i don't want to lose this layout and i don't know which mess-up along the way caused my comments link to just vanish.   :(

        this is my  back-to-school  post   call me a nerd, i am  excited  to get back to school.  the original plan: to take only the days immediately around christmas and new year's off, to go in on the days exactly halfway between christmas and new year's.  what actually happened: didn't go to school for work at all starting on the 23rd translating into a full  two-week  break.  after two weeks, i was starting to feel  stagnant .  it comes directly from feeling like i'm never going to graduate at my rate (of zero, over the holidays).  being back means my rate is non-zero and i'm back on  graduation-track  - you'd think.  alas, i'm in such lamentable student mode and life is just a series of semesters since as far back as i can remember.... here's to another semester! :)

        the funny thing about  rings    i never grew up wearing rings of any sort.  there is chinese folklore concerning how wealthy you will be depending on whether or not you can hold water in a cup formed by your hand.  that is, are there gaps between your fingers through which money will seep?  i guess mum looked at my hands while i was growing up and having not discerned gaps, she never put rings on my fingers that would separate my fingers and introduce gaps.  conversely, a superstitious person may start wearing rings to close natural gaps between fingers.  unless my hand and finger structure changes, i cannot but wear rings with very thin bands as to not introduce these unlucky, unfortunate gaps!  speaking of rings....  k and i went to see  lord of the rings: return of the king  a few days ago.  we tried to see a noon show but when we arrived at 11:55, the 12:00 and the 12:30 show were already sold out so we picked up 9 p.m. tickets for the same day to catch after we were done work.  after work (exhausting but fun!), we were already running a bit late and k still wanted to pick up ice cream along the way (to bring into the theater discreetly, shh!).  we never found out if our show was also sold out since we were 5 minutes late and wandered (read: ran) into the theater to see the only adjacent available seats to be ones in the very front row.  (mum would always encourage us to sit in the back with the same old song about how in hk you pay different prices for where you sat in the theater.  the closer to the screen, the cheaper your tickets would cost.)  i learned that a movie can be watched from the front row although it requires a period of adjustment.  it feels as if you have the entire theater to yourself, you don't feel the presence of anyone else when there is this massive screen hanging above you.  it was difficult to avert our eyes when something gruesome appeared on the screen....  i've watched a few movies with my sister recently and it is delightful to know that there is someone else out there (and i hadn't far to look) who is as freaked out as i am about  gruesome effects .  say, in  matrix revolutions  we saw a guy all lacerated in the face by the machines.  we couldn't watch his dying scene.  we turned to face each other in the theater and held on to each other until they no longer panned over the guy.  we even half-seriously considered ditching the movie at that point because it was nearly more than we could stomach and forgo knowledge of the ending of the store.  we were both really freaked out by the unexpected ending in  nicholas nickleby  and looking only out of the corners of our eyes during  jane eyre  when it was the "crazy lady's" scenes....  yes, we have watched too many movies this christmas!

        happy new year!   well, this isn't really an entry for me to spout about new year's resolutions or ringing in the new and stuff.  the changing of a julian calendar year is symbolic enough only for me to  not wash my hair  today (chinese superstition) and to not start it off by eating a hot dog from an outdoor vendor at grand parade five minutes after midnight!  (as that would be a really awful want for my stomach to start off the year!)  otherwise, i'm always noting throughout the year what of my attitudes and habits i need to change and those need addressing immediately and not saving them all up for a new year, don't you think?  (chinese new year in three weeks?  now, i do that one properly.  :) )  last night, for the first time since i've known them, i spent nearly up to midnight with my girlfriends mona and vinnie.  we split up before midnight (only to reunite short after  :)  ) when the party consisting of me and mona and others ended up at grand parade.  it was a bigger party than last year (so it was said) and a big factor was probably the weather - we've had this awesome (relatively) snow-free winter so far and yesterday night was chilly but not unbearable.  the fireworks at midnight were not awe-inspiring except we were up close so that was nifty.  :)

        six-step program   applying for schools next year is like a major ordeal for me.  it shouldn't be, but it is because this is  big .  but... consider this: i might be mentally psyched to do it, but i haven't made a move on anything and deadlines will come up before i know it.  here is my checklist of things to do.  until i've wrapped it  up, i'm not allowed to post here again!     order the  good transcript  in the appropriate numbers to the appropriate addresses   (ordered - received)    ask for the  first referee's  letter (my c.s. thesis supervisor)   (requested - he will "tailor" them based on profs he knows! - got 'em)    ask for the  second referee's  letter (a prof i marked for last year)   (requested - we had a nice chat about running! - got 'em)    submit my  application  -- fill in all the blanks! -- requires deciding what direction i want my education to take next (i.e., which profs i want to work with most)  order the  bad transcript  in the appropriate numbers to the appropriate addresses   (ordered - received)    ask for the  third referee's  letter (who will this be??)   (requested - it's my other supervisor - got 'em)

        white juan   the  urlLink star  reports about a  curfew  imposed on halifax.  for one day, only, i would hope.  we greeted a meter of hard-packed snow all the way down our driveway.  it took three hours of shoveling and three people to clear it.  for a day, it was like we were farm-labourers: rising bright and early to join our father outside because if we didn't, he was working alone.  and mum stayed indoors to prepare drinks and food for us ravenous snow-shovelers.  business was... good.  :)  our chinese food competitors did not open for business for the second straight day.  it was the largest one-day snowfall, exceeding the record set in halifax in 1944!  yeah!  and halifax got hit the hardest!  yes, with  hurricane juan  not five months ago, maritimers are wondering if there is some definite turn in the region's climate....

        how did you spend your valentine's?   friday night: went shopping by myself.  yes, much-anticipated  pamper me-time .  i got a  fobby  mexx shirt from pseudio (on sale, of course), a straight-laced clubbing top for saturday night, and i treated myself (for not irrationally buying other stuff), with lingerie.  yes, on the friday night before valentine's day, with husbands in  urlLink la senza  getting last minute gifts and girls holding red thongs with their boyfriends, i was buying myself lingerie ($12 hot pink mesh camisole and boyshort).  i'll tell you about my  treasure trove of lingerie  at another time....  saturday evening: worked my butt off.   valentine's day is good for business.   i was swamped with work.  at times i was grumbling because we were understaffed.  other times i was grumbling, "why can't these people go on dates at our restaurant throughout the year?!"  but then, it was only 8 p.m.  it's not like my girlfriends were doing anything different from me (busting their butts working in other restaurants).  valentine's day for us working girls began at the stroke of midnight, february 15.  i wore  red pants and a black rose in my hair  to work.  that's called marking the occasion in style.   :)   i thought about how inordinate numbers of people would be  coupling  that night... ew....  thuy and i went to The Dome.  i hate that place, but for the second week in a row, i would not hate it so much.  last week, i learned that while there i can meet chinese people in this miserable city.  this week, i ran into someone that i have been hankering to see again in a social situation.  dancing is usually my reward for running so much during the week, but conversation is better.   :)

        singleton /  urlLink quirkyalone  / spinster / old-maid ....    so, i'm single again.  i even marked down in my calendar when i'm allowed on another date: three-and-a-half months from now.  it follows the formula defined in  urlLink sex and the city :  allow half the time of the relationship to recover, and subtract a month for every year you are over thirty.   k is like, "you don't have to freak out until you're 28."  well, i don't want to put on blinders until i'm 28 either, because knowing me, i will really, really,  really  freak out on my 28 th  birthday.  i guess it's all relative, you know?  if your two older sisters got married when they were just 24, then you would be feeling like a really late blossomer if you don't do it as well.  in my case, some of my male cousins married before they are thirty and their wifes were late 20's.  to  keep up with my family , i have meet mr. right  tomorrow  and do that three-year dating thing that is oh-so necessary before marriage.  today, february 14, is  international  urlLink quirkyalone  day  (iqd).  (in the quirkyalone quiz, i scored  78  -- "somewhat quirkyalone (otherwise known as quirkytogether): you are probably part of a mysterious group of people, the quirkytogethers. you share many of our quirky qualities, but you manage to find yourself, on a regular basis, in a coupled situation. interesting."  it's true, and it's interesting.)

       (i highlighted the relevant portions, lol.)   i'll bet you expected this answer. you already knew you were a  DARK ANGELIC , didn't you? you are similar to a demon but slightly different in that you don't revel in evil...you revel in pleasure. your wings resemble an angel's but if that's so then you  are a Fallen Angel - your love of sin caused you to be cast from the heavens. they are black as raven wings and are nearly as dark as your desires. you are faithless and love it - you believe there is no judgement day to fear and so you can do what you want!  you have a refined concept of what is sexy and a slightly chaotic sense of 'fun.'  in fact, you love chaos and view much of what you do as a game. you are typically attracted to those that will challenge your mind, power, and wit...and are 'dangerous' people like you. it's not unlikely that you are bisexual or at least open to the concept, because you seek excitement and passion everywhere and in everyone.  chances are you have a special talent for magick - you're a powerful being and you know what you want.  like a serpent of eden you like to try your powers of seduction and manipulation, though your intent is rarely to cause harm. you have a deep, dark sense of art and/or poetry, because your mind is a deep, dark place. while typically smirking, amused, and sarcastic, you are capable of severe revenge and a passion and intensity unrivaled by any other. in your eyes life is for enjoyment and pleasure - nothing else. If you're not having fun in your own twisted way, you're not happy. you are easily bored with the vast majority of people. you are most likely drawn towards the Gothic subculture and probably adore goth music, art, and style. many people look down on your seemingly careless lifestyle and may even consider you 'slutty'.  not true.  you just know you're sexy and you're damn proud of it.  dark angels have an outlook most like satanists - loving sin and looking to none but themselves for power. congratulations!  you're my kindred spirit. as far as I'm concerned - you know what life is REALLY about.  have fun...muahaha.  urlLink  *~*~*claim your wings - pics and long answers*~*~*  brought to you by  urlLink quizilla

          dragon buffet king [sic]   after running on wednesday (4 miles.  too short!), one of chris or bob suggested going to the "new" (a few months now) buffet restaurant in the  blip  (bayers lake industrial park).  i groaned and told them how my family, being in the business, checks out every chinese restaurant that comes to town but i had no interest in trying out yet another buffet.  besides  buffet is bad for the diet .  not that i'm on a diet.  but stuffing yourself kind of counters the lost calories of running....  so, dragon buffet king (shouldn't it be dragon  king  buffet?) occupies the spot that housed the honey garlic buffet for i-don't-know how many years in blip.  another day, i will talk about blip.  it is a monstrosity of grotesque proportions.  sigh.  we never went to honey garlic.  after the buffet restaurants in halifax fizzled (remember oriental pearl?  andrew surely does.), we didn't bother trying the others that came and went.  unfortunately i don't have a basis of comparison with, say,  mandarin  in toronto because i never got a chance to go there.  apparently it's good.  i don't know the reason though.  decor in dragon buffet is nice.  individual tables are mahogany-stained simple four-legged tables and the chairs are mahogany-stained in a chinese-style.  the room is broken up with "dividers" that are mahogany-stained lattice carvings... for lack of a better word.  it's like a cleaner version of the restaurant in  urlLink crouching tiger hidden dragon , and more brightly lit.  not bad.  in the foyer, there were notices of chinese dinners (no english translation) for 2, 3, and 4 people going for $20-something, $30-something, and $40-something, respectively.  although i couldn't read all the dishes' names, i could tell they weren't serving chicken balls for one of the courses, no way.  they serve bubble tea from  urlLink tea shop 168 , a familiar franchise from toronto, who provided them with glossy and colourful menus.  they didn't serve everything on the glossy menu (they didn't serve crushed ice, sherbets, iced coffees.... basically they served just milk tea) and denoted what they offered wth red marker circling the items offered.  i ordered taro milk tea (3.99) - purple and perfumy.  served in a tall glass (~yawn) that is so different from any concoction available here.  we checked out the buffet (11.95) of course....  there were nearly 40 pans of hot food.  4 were used for fried rice (vegetable fried, seafood, plain, etc.)  and three or four pans of different kinds of egg rolls and spring rolls.  i didn't touch the french fries, taters, chicken wings, sweet & sour sauce, fried wontons, gravy, chicken balls, bbq ribs, cold shrimp, cold mussels.  and  i didn't finish any of my plates .  that  being said, here is the rundown on what i had:  - singapore noodles - really dry, like a mouthful of hay sprinkled with curry, no meats or anything (did not finish) - black bean chicken - it came in this odd battered form, really dry, kind of salty - general tao chicken - also battered, tasted more like authentic sweet & sour but i'm not really familiar with authentic general tao, not too bad - hot & sour soup - call it  sweet  & sour soup instead, they used water chesnuts (yuck) and the pork pieces were dry and hard (dnf) - moo goo guy pan - i got it for the vegetables, tasted like typical chinese food - fried tofu - the first piece was great: the tofu was fresh, when got thinner slices, the salty sauce was overwhelming (dnf) - lo mein - very blah... (dnf)  - beef with broccoli - small pieces of beef that were dried under the heat lamp, broccoli was good - i like broccoli (dnf) - honey ribs - the cut of the ribs were not good, kind of veiny, but good cuts are too expensive for a buffet, it was okay - broccoli salad - i love broccoli, this was sweet creamy dressing and raisins, from the salad bar - shanghai noodles - the best of the noodles, they used a thinner shanghai noodle and i liked it because it was slightly spicy - beijing bun with condensed milk -  mmmm   gnun see guune ... it was a little hard from being first fried and then dried under a heat lamp but it was nice to have something really and truly authentic.  i didn't need to visit the dessert table  they served won ton soup (didn't venture to try it), had a salad bar, and a dessert bar with scoop-yourself ice cream.  soft drinks (1.75) are limitless.  there is a  stuffed animal vending machine , one of those ones where you drop in some money and operate a crane to grasp a stuffed animal.  this one gave you unlimited tries for $2 until you secured a stuffed animal so, oddly, you might not have paid $2 in a shop for toy but you would if it was in a vending machine....  bob wanted a technicoloured (tie-dyed, to me) stuffed lobster (those marine bio's, i tell you) and he picked up a teddy bear and a dog before chris could get the lobster on the first try.  :p  (those guys came up with the crazy idea of the fun of having one of those in their house for dispensing beer.  guests would have unlimited tries and are guaranteed a bottle of beer.  they would make the heineken's hard to reach and you have to pick up and drink 5 canadians before you have a shot at the heineken.   guys.  beer.   what can i say?  i don't take credit for the idea.  i'm just the mouthpiece.)  dragon buffet king --- address: 201 chain lake drive, halifax

        vooz     (no guarantee that the following facts are right)  first there was  urlLink hello kitty .  in fact, she turned 30 just four days ago (hmm, same birth day as my friend yi-ling).  sanrio is responsible for my all-time favourite character,  pochacco , and other thriving ones like keroppi, monchiki, pekkle, my melody, and twin stars.  other great "houses" came along, like  urlLink san-x  who brought us  tarepanda , that lazy panda.  and i love  urlLink morning glory  - babu, blue bear, the crew.   :) .  and that strange but adorable  urlLink bunny  with the bathroom problems....  also in the  urlLink mashimaro  family are the adorable monkeys  urlLink pista and pistachi .  and now i have found  urlLink vooz  who brought us that bratty twerp,  pucca , and, apparently,  mura military pigs .  with all this, why on earth would a girl want to grow up??  great finds: - mura animated shorts urlLink [1]   urlLink [2]   urlLink [3]  -  urlLink mura wallpapers  -  urlLink pucca wallpapers  - in fact,  urlLink wallcoo  has lots of different cartoons' wallpapers  :)

        get organized    i gave up on the idea of an electronic  research diary .  so i'm back to an old-fashioned fieldbook....  sort of.   miquelrius  notebooks can be purchased in halifax from  urlLink loomis & toles .  and no where else!  actually, you may be able to get it elsewhere in the city and comparable notebooks exist (i can think of really nice  urlLink morning glory  ones but you can't get morning glory in halifax, grr.  and i think mg-usa is the place that doesn't ship to canada.  double grr.).  i remember a year or two ago, k was extolling the features of miquelrius notebooks: - perforated pages that when torn out are fully 8.5" x 11" (unlike hilroy) - really sturdy paper (unlike hilroy) - coloured borders of the pages make for easy categorization and eye candy - sturdy and pleasing plastic covers on front and back of the notebook (mine is solid translucent blue but you can get girly designs as seen on the right) - sturdy ring spiral that doesn't deform as you yank pages out (like hilroy)  in addition, i have regained internet access at home.  whew.  now i'm not restrained to doing all my school work and all my, err, non-school work in eight hours of the day.  now i have to work in the evening too!  i've been such a bad grad student so far... now i'm finally getting into it!  in any case, i don't like looking for work... while i'm at work.  makes me feel like a sell-out, especially if i'm looking for a job in industry....

        how could some people....?   we swung by the restaurant after leaving school today and were not displeased to see that our help was required.  mum was aflutter because we had pushed out a $200+ order and then a $100+ order and that is quite odd for a lazy monday night.  a woman ordered a combination plate and complained that she would have to pay a certain amount extra because she wanted to make changes to the stated special.  she accepted the charges anyhow and we thought that was the last of her....  fifteen or twenty minutes later, she returned with a soggy paper bag asking for a new bag.  oh, and she said we forgot her egg roll.  in the kitchen, k squawked because she most certainly did not forget to pack it.  sure enough, when we repackaged the order, we could discern the  dent in the rice  where an egg roll had lain.  it was our word against hers and we have to be the bigger people and give her what she was implying we should do.  what were our other possible courses of action?   1.  (w's suggestion) repackage the order in a dry paper bag and not give them an extra egg roll.  we all know that they got what they paid for.   2.  (k's suggeation) taking a sarcastic attitude while giving them what they want, telling them that we'll let it go but,  honestly , try harder next time to make their lie stand up... like mess up the rice.   3.  (w's suggestion) remain silent this time but, oh, remember them well and if they try to pull the trick again, tell them we're not falling for it again.  miserly people think that we make a fortune or something (which is so not true) and i could only be grateful that these people were trying to con us out of only $1.

        fun!   it's been a while since i've had a chockful night out  on the town , trying out a new place, watching a good movie, etc.    andrew and i went to  jane's on the commons , at the cunard and robie corner of the halifax commons.  it opened maybe six months ago with a rave review from the coast.  oddly, when we stepped in, i caught a waft of a japanese restaurant aroma.  (maybe it was many orders of a certain soy-ginger [sic] salmon.)  we were told we would have to wait maybe fifteen minutes for a table (this was around 7 p.m. on a friday) but what i observed at that hour was quick turnover and the three of our groups did not have to wait that long in the end.  it seems as if people from all areas of halifax (except the area in which jane's is located) came out to inspect and dine in, "ooh la la, the shadier side of town," as surely jane's is located in north end halifax.  funny that.  the tables and chairs at the bar and the dining room are all black.  a blackboard listing the specials and desserts occupy most of the only available wall.  the place mats are red, in a stark contrast just as the picture of "jane" on a red backdrop is also striking.  since one wall is windows looking into the street, you don't need a sign over the door to know it is jane's, you can just look for the larger-than-life face on the red wall.  the chairs along the windows weren't exactly... they were black-coloured wooden benches soften only with decorative cushions you can place behind your back while you are there for an hour.  i didn't want to wait until the end of the meal to order a hot chocolate made with real belgian chocolate (2.50).  andrew, true to form, ordered steamed mussels (5.95) while we decided on the rest of our order.  the menu is not very large at all: about three kinds of salads, 2 kinds of soup, and six entrees when you have taken into account the special entree of the day.  i ordered the atlantic salmon fillet in "soy-ginger" (14.95) while andrew ordered breaded veal schnitzel (14.95).  the mussels were not plentiful but they were good, steamed in a creamy sauce.  they were dressed with julienned "roasted" vegetables: snowpeas, carrots, squash, and red and yellow peppers that made it all pretty.  my hot chocolate was like liquified hagen daas chocolate ice cream ( slurp ).  i was kind of afraid that andrew would get a really flat piece of schnitzel and you couldn't tell whether it was veal and not pork.  fortunately, he was presented with what amounts to a breaded veal steak - very tender and juicy and fragrant.  the meal also came with julienned vegetables (same ones as with the mussels) and the "starch" of the day, mashed potatoes where the potato skins were mixed in for... colour.  my salmon fillet was a rectangular strip laid across vegetables and mashed potatoes.  the plate was adorn with  soya  spots (brown) and ginger pools (green).  the ginger pools had a hint of coriander so i had to avoid them!  half my salmon wasn't cooked properly but the part that was was quite good.  the dessert menu wasn't really thrilling but that is no fault of theirs because it was acceptably extensive (6 items or so) but i suppose we just had in mind something else....  like  urlLink dio mio's! .  it was 2 for 1 hot brownie delights so we ordered one each (5.00 in total).  the brownie was warmed and delightfully delicious like chocolate cake and it was all served in a waffle cup.  we watched  urlLink big fish .  mmm, nice movie.  i'm not really, really into it, but it was certainly nice... different, but nice.  jane's on the common --- address: 2394 robie street hours: 11:30-2, 5-10

        how to pick up   yup, yup,  big clubbing night .  originally i was going out because i (with a friend) could meet up with my sister (with a friend) in a venue she hardly ever frequents (a club).  but in the evening, her friend flaked out and watching back-to-back movies tired her out and i had this small quandry....  i felt as if t were going out to amuse me and it was late when she was available (us waitresses, we have that extra uncertainty when we get off work).  but we persevered on anyhow and ended up first at  urlLink pacifico .  it was the first time in ages for either of us so it was like "new" club in feel.  not much action there.  i mean, it was bulging at the seams what with the saturday crowd but there were also mba semi-formal attendees.  the music was good, mostly danceable.  at 2 a.m. (after 90 minutes there), we rolled to  urlLink the dome .  there things got more interesting....  for one thing, i did the friend thing and stuck with t all evening.  sometimes my attitude upon reaching a club is more like that of a guy's (according to s.'s description of guys' behaviour) - fanning out from my girlfriends in order to  prowl alone .  i felt a sense of satisfaction and a job properly done by chillin' all night with t.  and boy did we garner pick-ups.  just like how guys want to see how many phone numbers you can get in an evening, we wanted to see how many  pick-up attempts  we would garner.  the final score: 8-5 for t.  i think she was more successful for the following reasons:  wearing something a little more  low-cut  (she wore a v-neck, i wore a cowl-neck) - otherwise, in a dark setting in a club, our figures are similar enough.... she wore a bit of  colour  - black & red top - while i wore no colour - all-black  she had red lips  while mine were mocca and...  she smiled  while i got the repeat comment, "you don't smile much, do you?"  i think another reason for our astounding success is that the guys here (thank you halifax for not being a culturall diverse city?) were floored that we looked like we came as a pair.  individually we would not have had the  success  we had.  yeah... you could see the wheels turning in their heads....  finally, we saw some of t's friends and from the fringe observed their dancing.  it was... nothing we hadn't seen before from really drunk and lusty strangers but it was odd to observe it amongst people we know more intimate details about...  what i'm getting at is... my curiosity is piqued and i am fascinated by this erotic girl-on-guy or girl-on-girl or guy-on-girl-on-guy dancing.  every time i see it, it is alluring.  i remember going out with the viet crew (like 8 vietnamese girls and 2 chinese girls) and getting a lot of imaginations going with girl-on-girl-on-girl-on-girl... dancing.  but i wouldn't (and i'm glad she wouldn't either) subject myself to girl-on-guy #1 dancing and immediately after do girl-on-guy #2 dancing with guy#3 waiting on the wings....  that's just nasty and i'll leave it at that.  t thinks she might  throw in the clubbing towel  soon (she's 22!) and i feel like someone who needs to grow up in light of that.  i maintain that if you're going in order to enjoy the venue with your friends, it doesn't matter how old you are (to some limit).  dancing, hanging out, even drinking with people you trust, even if in a club environment, is perfectly sounds and healthy.  if you view it as a place to find your next close encounter... well, that's just not advisable... i mean, that part is best to grow out of.

        a walk down memory lane   winnie at  urlLink aiyah  has posted pictures from her trip to hk (mar 2004 archives).  although she did not post all of the 1,000 pictures she took, the descriptions and sporadic pictures are ample to spark my memory.  i haven't been there in  15 years  but most things she said ring true.  i said it before, it changes so much on the surface but not really underneath it all....  last night, i finally got around to reading this article,  urlLink tokyo on one cliche a day , which brought me straight back to japan in some ways....   chinese goodies   as a self-proclaimed purveyor of chinese goods... oh, who am i kidding, the rate that i purvey is nearly non-existent....  here are some goodies i recently found     urlLink ai qin hai  is an internet radio station accessible through  urlLink winamp  - i can't live without it... except when the server is full.  :(   urlLink koish.com  is also an internet radio station accessible through winamp - often the server is full :( :( :(  i'm learning 5 mandarin phrases a day at  urlLink the online college of chinese language .  you'll need the  urlLink pinyin font .  it has a nice format where you get the conversation in chinese characters, the english translation, the pinyin alongside,  and  you can listen to a sound file for the conversation!   urlLink zhongwen.com  - my shameless plug for my favourite online chinese dictionary.  i use it first for it's chinese-english dictionary if i see a character i don't recognize and the english-chinese dictionary is pretty decent as well.  you can easily see how one character you have found is part of many different words    note about the mandarin: i've had tutors (2, maybe 3, in hk and here) try to teach me but i've been stubborn about the need  to know it (how my mother was right... little did she know how right she  would  be), self-instruction in reading and writing, and daily practice in cantonese (not the same, but some words are really similar).  so it's not a foreign language altogether to me except everytime it is spoken quickly... and when i don't have a transcript of the conversation.  ^_^   i don't know exactly how much i will learn but it's conscious exposure rather than none at all.  at the very least     i'm probably picking up some pinyin and if i can see the pinyin, i can have an immediate strong clue what the word might be  reading the conversations in chinese is daily reinforcement of things i would forget and i'm learning about the sentence structure of more formal chinese (cantonese is so not formal)  aural is my weakest point in all languages but i  might  learning something along the way....     propz to my cousin's uncle's hotel   the  urlLink white swan hotel  in guangzhou, canton province, was mentioned in  urlLink l&o: ci  when super-detective goren figured out from picking up a chinese phrase book and eyeing the brochure for white swan hotel in it, that the couple he was questioning is looking to adopt.  apparently all prospective parents are put up in that hotel, his tip-off.  i remember staying there with 10 other members of my family and the big banquets we had every night because of my cousin's family's affiliation with the owner.  besides the garden in the hotel, i remember most the  kids' table  during the banquets and being served turtle soup... with a soften turtle-shell over the soup....  maybe my memories are kind of screwed-up....    controversial   on the other hand,  urlLink this  hit internet airwaves rather recently.  it's really shocking and bafflingly disappointing.   urlLink here  is a petition to gave a wake-up call to that advertiser.

        sooooo not a girl    so, it's apparently  spring  in nova scotia.  this means with each cold drizzle, the rain whittles away at our snowbanks and there is no net increase in snowbank height.  not-girl trait #1: my hair, just a few inches past my shoulders, feels totally unwieldy,  way too long  so i simply had to go for a trim.   chop-chop.   not-girl trait #2: what's with paying $30 for a  trim  at  Ooh-life-salon-&-spa-Ooh .  so i went to  urlLink first choice  where cuts are ~$10 and they don't try to ply you with  herbal tea  while you wait for an appointment.  as far as i'm concerned, the hairdresser at fch is nearly as qualified and has way less attitude....  not-girl trait #3: regardless of how much hair i have to begin with, i want  the most cut for my buck .  the most service for my dollar, you know.  and despite the fact hits-at-the-shouler hair doesn't quite suit me, i'll inch towards that length because i'm bloody paying for it....!   lol.   not-girl trait #4: things like pomade, hairspray, gel, mousse, deep conditioner, hot oil treatment, a blow-dryer, flat brushes, and round barrels.... are foreign objects to me.  my sister seems to have gotten all the girlie genes but looking at my parents i wonder if it didn't "skip a generation...."  i don't quite look like alice over there but sometimes i feel like i look like her....  she put  deep layers  in my hair with layers in the back to lighten the mass that is my mane.   i am such a girl........    these  guys  are working at these athletic clothing stores (footlocker, sportchek, cleves, etc.) could tell me all sorts of stuff about the support that different running, x-trainers, hiking, walking shoes have and the new design of the new balance shoes for overpronation and... i don't care!  i don't care because i don't have overwhelming foot problems that demand the specialized support.  and i'm not  that  serious into running, tennis, hiking, x-training that i would need your highest end shoes either.  (further, with the number of pairs of shoes i have, they can't all be so pricey!)  so....  i base my decision on (1) price - over $120 and that is high end to me - i try to get something around $100 and (2)  how good it looks!   imagine, then, me standing in a sportchek superstore with a rack full of 20 hiking/outdoor shoes at my disposal and i've decided that i won't get something too expensive (i will go on max. three hikes this summer, not too difficult ones) or too heavy-duty-looking (i want to be able to wear them in a normal life capacity).  imagine the salesman's displeasure when i zero in on the tan-coloured and blue-coloured shoes which  coincidentally  cost only $70.  yeah, he looked displeased that  i totally flaked out .  everything felt the same to me - new! - so my final decision hinged on how good they would look with various pants and jeans i own....  i ended up with the columbia trail meisters you see at the right for $70.  :)  (and my feet are in heaven  and  i have been able to  motor  around campus.  :p)

        quiet weekend   didn't do much this weekend and i don't know why i'm bothering to report!!  mona and i went for  chocolate brownie concoctions  at  fireside  and she had the right idea going by skipping dinner... oh, i registered a weight gain despite my best efforts and running 10+ miles on sunday.   :(   sunday was my long-run day and i learned that i have to start running at noon in order to have time to complete 13 miles and cool down properly in time for work.  unfortunately i'm downgrading my goal from a full-marathon to a half one.  i doubt i will have the sheer interest in spending  4+ hours  running, required of a 26-mile run.  but i'm pretty much sticking to the outlined  urlLink schedule  except the long runs on sunday will max at 13 miles.  and you know what?  i'm pretty happy with the physical side effects of the training so far.   :)   and that was the  original goal - to get really fit by summer and to kickstart a really healthy lifestyle  - the side benefit being able to participate in a marathon!  next weekend should be interesting since my sister-the-hermit will be hitting one of the happenin' clubs on saturday and i'll meet up with her after work.   watch out halifax!! :)    you should check out this link   ( urlLink link )  i don't have a digital camera, alas!  i'll see what i can do with a webcam and they didn't say i couldn't use a regular camera....  (found this link at  urlLink stef's site )

        fun f5   if you...     ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   easy!  girly cocktail drinks and desserts (fruit-topped cheesecakes) and chinese baked goods and desserts!   ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   easy!  i'd be a retailer of sanrio and morning glory, vooz....  oh, and juxtapose it with an electronics section with the niftiest  ultralite  gadgets.   ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?   easy!  a work of fiction based on the first-generation chinese-canadian plight.  hey, write about what you know, right?   ...ran a school, what would you teach?   easy!  introductory biochemistry.  inspire minds when they are still young and pliable and open to science.   ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?   uh... i don't make music of any sort.  it would be a money-losing and humiliating endeavour.  i just wouldn't!

        stupid spending bug    it's so nice that there is free shipping at  urlLink amazon.ca .  i don't even have to spend on gas to drive to the bookstore.  just purchased me a copy of  urlLink the (phylogenetics) bible .  at $79.58 CAD, no less.  yes, i can say that i need it for my thesis and, hence, my future.  but it also quenched (for today) my spending urges....

        indisa 2004 -- part two  ( urlLink click for  more  hot off the press pictures )  indisa 2004 at the SUB (student union building) didn't leave me with the greatest desire to continue partying into the night (that ordeal was four hours in length, and i had been out for two hours before that)....  then we arrived at  copacabana  where the afterparty was being held (i was grumbling the entire way, i don't like the club).  it was much the same way as i remembered it: more restaurant than dance club, with a match-box sized dance floor that looks happening even if five people are on it.  i'll give copa some credit: it is unlike any other place in halifax.  what with the plushy restaurant tables and booths and a classier bar, you get the feeling you have stepped into a steamy, intimate, little lounge in cuba (not that i have been to one or to cuba for the matter) where the focus is more on lounging (than in other clubs) than on dancing.  what also did it for making copa an acceptable place to be saturday night was the influx of people partying with their friends.  we (indisa people) were like one massive group of, er, friends and that generates much better atmosphere than 50 separate groups trying to show up each other...  by far .  further, at the request of party-goers, the dj played some of the music we heard during the dance shows and that stuff (apologies to hkpop and a-pop) totally rocks.  it really makes you want to move to it....  so i did.  but... copa would close and the night was still young (only 2 a.m.!) and so we rolled / strolled to  the dome .  some drama had gone down between one of the guys in our group and his girlfriend-of-ten-days.  apparently the steamy club environment had caused too much of a lusty sentiment and a lust triangle formed.  of course, i half-amusedly / half-disgustedly observed the triangle for quite some time on the dance floor but in his intoxicated state, he had not noticed it until, i don't know, it all clicked for him.  then he snapped.   sigh.  kids.   first thing at the next club, i got caught in a "traffic jam" on the main stairwell and one snotty guy from montreal would say that haligonians don't know how to deal with traffic.  yeah, we're too nice to each other in clubs here and stuff....  it didn't take long for me to run into w.  thank goodness, because upon seeing him i was able to turn off the  prowl  and put on blinders for the rest of the evening.  it was fun just to hang out at the bar and chat - even  overtaking fun that would be dancing. at 3:45  it was still too early to call it a night so we went to my favourite 24-hour coffeeshop on the waterfront in the wee hours of the morning for good convo and fruit-topped cheesecake!  :D

        indisa 2004  ( urlLink click for hot off the press pictures! )  well, the costumes worn by performers and audience were really nice.  colourful.  and inspiring.  the performances were also very inspiring.  it makes me want to go out and choreograph (i.e., make my own) some folk chinese or vietnamese performance.  i  almost  wanted to submit myself to multicultural festival this year but i have  semi-retired .  i can be brought out of retirement for a good enough cause... but only that.  it also made me yearn for a culture that loves more  song and  dance   (since i'm not much for singing, i'm tone-deaf).  what i have seen of chinese performances (ribbon dance, anyone?) is conservative, communist, blatantly patriotic/nationalistic/whatever and downright boring.  and our guys don't dance like the indians guys did....  sorry about being all brief and stuff.  i'm exhausted right now and we haven't even made it to the  after-party  yet.  we lined up for the  buffet  dinner at 9 p.m. for an hour in a line that snaked across the banquet hall to be told that they had "run short," and that more food would arrive in half an hour.  it was actually an hour (11 p.m.) before we got sustenance.  now it's time to go out ( copabana  anyone?) to dance off all the food (not) we ate....

        first f5 in a while!       what was the last song you heard?  - nicky wong lee hom's "can you feel my world."  it's my current theme song, thanks to the introduction from paul.  i downloaded the lyrics and used a  urlLink chinese word processor  to attach  pinyin  under the characters.  i can't speak mandarin let along sing it so fast!   what were the last two movies you saw?  - rented two movies to watch while jogging over this week:  urlLink 28 days  (was ok) and  urlLink the affair of the necklace  (really good)   what were the last three things you purchased?  (1) extra large green tea so my eyes can stay open this morning, (2) a pretty cuticle cream that you apply to your cuticles like colouring your hand with a marker, and (3) postage for my applications   what four things do you need to do this weekend?  (1) read something to relax, (2) hammer away some more on my  thesis , (3) party!, and (4) work at the restaurant   who are the last five people you talked to?  my sister and mother this morning, paul and w in msn in the very early morning, and... i said, "hi" to a prof when we crossed paths on the stairwells....

        i'm baaaaaack! :D   as for my applications....     order the  good transcript  in the appropriate numbers to the appropriate addresses   (ordered - received)      ask for the  first referee's  letter (my c.s. thesis supervisor)   (requested - he will "tailor" them based on profs he knows! - got 'em)      ask for the  second referee's  letter (a prof i marked for last year)   (requested - we had a nice chat about running! - got 'em)      submit my  application  -- fill in all the blanks! -- requires deciding what direction i want my education to take next (i.e., which profs i want to work with most)   (finito!)      order the  bad transcript  in the appropriate numbers to the appropriate addresses   (ordered - received)      ask for the  third referee's  letter (who will this be??)   (requested - it's my other supervisor - got 'em)        what you missed while i was away     i submitted my applications - fingers crossed!   urlLink sex and the city  ended.  this is part of the narrative:  "the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself.  and if you find someone to love the  you  you love, well, that's just fabulous."  -- carrie bradshaw from  sex and the city  "an american girl in paris (part deux)  i had  two perfect weeks  of running (weeks 6 and 7, baby)  at the beginning of week 8, bolt(s) fell off my treadmill and i had to diminish a 14-mile run to 9.9.   boo hoo!   he's preparing for the full marathon, too -  urlLink marathon man   once a year i get into the gambling spirit:  urlLink rrroll up the rim to win  time where i get my usual cappuccino and a chance to win, er, a donut.  k and i have decided to go to  buffalo .  yeah, i know, it's not the most enchanting american city but we'll be in toronto anyways, loading up on cool things korean, japanese, and chinese and we'll rent a car and drive to buffalo.  on the way, near niagara falls, is a  polo outlet store .  our destination:  urlLink walden galleria  contains all these non-canadian stores - jc penney,  express ,  frederick's of hollywood ,  victoria's secret ,  a & f,  j.crew , old navy (we'll probably hit the one in eaton center instead),  jarman shoes  (heehee, rhymes with k's name), zales, bed bath & beyond, pottery barn, and  godiva chocolatier .  god knows what i've missed because i don't recognize the name!!  hopefully there will be a sephora and crate & barrel along the way....  in the section that said, "please use this page... to submit additional information regarding your educational history... or any other factor which you think will bear upon your admission," i drew a blank and considered cracking jokes to show how well i have straddled the two fields i am in.  say....  what did the biologist do when she had twins?  she baptized one and left the other as a control.  (thanks to paul for this one.)   and to show that i am also a computer scientist:  why do mathematicians get confused between hallowe'en and christmas?  because oct. 31 ( (31) 8  ) is the same as dec. 25 ( (25) 10  ) (thanks to chris for this one.)   don't worry, i didn't submit the jokes.... :p     happy birthday to me   i couldn't get my act together to submit the application packages  on  my birthday (wednesday) so i could post something new.  well, now i have and all i can do is wait... three weeks for one of the places and perhaps two months for the other.  i will keep you apprised.   well, in honour of being twenty-five going on twenty-six, i bought myself kim wong keltner's  urlLink the dim sum of all things .  the main character, lindsey, is also twenty-five at the beginning of the novel.  i was curious because she's "worse off" than i am - as a third generation chinese-american, her parents were born in the states while mine came from "the old country."  i don't know how much incentive my child(ren) will have to care about the "old culture" when both i and they are born here.  it's just a fact of life, i guess, and it's a downer to think that the whole cause is lost.   as a recap, i have read     amy tan's  joy luck club , first generation women and their daughters who are all born in the united states  click  when they learn of their mothers' tragic stories in china.  we all need to understand that underlying all the nagging and over-protectiveness is a love that is stronger than any other.  terry woo's  banana boys , about first generation chinese guys struggling with their mostly latent chinese identity and otherwise the lot that is their lives (none of them have extraordinarily difficult ones, and the same can be said for many of the rest of us).  i like how they all made small steps by the end of the novel towards reconciliation towards each other and family.  no extraordinarily happy ending, just... you get the feeling that they got on in their lives a little more comfortably than before, with less angst, more self-love, and that they will be alright afterall... and so will you!  cathy bao bean's  chopsticks-fork memoir , the memoir of a first generation chinese-american (same as the mothers in joy luck club) who came when she was really young and her trials when raising a biracial son born in the united states.  she was a philosophy professor which meant some parts were a bit too kooky for me to digest.  in an unorthodox environment, her son turned out just fine.  married a chinese girl, too.  i've known for a while that i don't have the strength to be with someone not of my race.  not without the resolve that she had.  finally, kim wong keltner's  the dim sum of all things , about a third generation chinese-american who is implausibly blind to her chinese identity.  well, she finds out over the course of the novel but, holy, the barrage of stereotypes and racist experiences ms. wong keltner stuffs into the novel makes it a really self-loathing and angsty novel.  k thinks ms. wong keltner found novel-writing to be therapy for her and that is very possibly true.  but what do the readers get out of the obvious and saccharine conclusion?  if the author's research is accurate, well, then i learned a whole lot of tidbits about the chinese way in a fairly interesting context (which should make the tidbits easier to remember).    my conclusions?  (since i have to show that i have learned something, on the eve - er, the day after - of my birthday)  to  count my blessings      i have had the opportunity to travel to hong kong, china, japan, and taiwan.  yes, the big cities change when you blink but the culture of the big cities stay basically the same even if the skyline is ever so different now than it was before and i had a chance to see it.  likewise, the villages don't change that much and i saw that as well, even if all this was over ten years ago.  i'm fluent in english (which is an asset here!) no matter how much i want to be from "the old country" to the point that i sometimes wish i am  f.o.b. .  at the same time, i can express myself in chinese.  not brilliantly.  not without an accent that i cannot detect for myself.  i'd be a different person that i wouldn't like so much if i was an immigrant.  i can't elaborate on how exactly but i do appreciate the canadian identity that has seeped into my upbringing.  i'm more determined than before to not take second-best in life.  (that was something i learned throughout the year, culminating in an epiphany, oh, two months ago.)    otherwise, birthdays are  stressful  because there are so many  rituals  i have to follow - some traditional ones and some that i've made up....     couldn't wash my hair the day of (or all the luck will wash away) -  chinese  - even my sister can't wash her hair so we had to specially schedule to do it the day before....  wearing a a new outfit -  chinese  - can't afford a new outfit, so i wore new (nice) underwear! :p  having a perfect day to start the year off properly -  my own  - i straightened my hair so i would see the new year in a really sleek state.  :)  otherwise, the day went alright....  having chicken on my birthday -  chinese  - pieces of water-injected chicken in my frozen pasta would have to suffice....  having noodles ( meen ) -  chinese  - made especially sure to order udon at the japanese place for dinner (pasta isn't  meen )  having cake ( dahn goh ) -  chinese  - did, that's why we get cakes, even as we get so old!  having shrimp ( ha ) -  chinese  - so i will be merry all year long!

       this year...  i found myself responsible for more slips and forms than ever before.... must be getting old  the instructions seemed more clear this year than they were last year.... not so many hopeless shots in the dark while filling it out, i hope  i learned that  you have to do it all in one sitting , if possible  if this were my job, i'd rock; but since i do it only once a year....  i hate the part about having to swear it is all correct to the best of my knowledge!   strategy : first, i separated my copy of all slips from the ones i will eventually hand in, then i ripped all the forms out and labeled one set as "COPY" (i went through on this one in pencil); the other set i folded up and put it into the envelope to keep them all together until i actually fill them out for real.  the tax guide served as a makeshift folder for all the straggling slips.

       watched a  urlLink really bad movie . at least it kept me on the treadmill for 91 minutes and i amused myself trying to dream up what bad cliche would come up next....   i guess i'm gonna do it....    i finally got around to registering for the  urlLink bluenose marathon .  yesterday, my sister asked me,  "are you still running in the marathon??"   what prompted this question?  well, i wussed out from running on saturday (too much to do in the day and had to work at night) and i totally skipped sunday's long run (making it the third week in a row i've skipped the long run, i had full-body pain - sprained toe, tired back, and sore-to-all-heavens quad muscles).  so, whether it's sunny or drizzling or raining, i'ma obligated to go now that i've registered.  for vanity sake, i even put myself down for a  size-small t-shirt .  hope it fits by then because i'm still oh-you're-a-medium in size.  (scrolled through the  urlLink race confirmation list .  i hope many other people are simply holding off their registration because i recognized two names on the list so far: the doctor who gives me a check-up every year and a long-lost - still lost - childhood acquaintance....)

       it's been  urlLink two-and-a-half months  since the end of only the second relationship that i allowed to be deemed official (careful my wording, mind you).  would you believe that i hadn't really taken a break from the dating realm for three years?  suffice it to say, the last 2.5 months have been different from "the usual"....  (and there's only one more month of self-imposed singledom.)  what surprised me (and disappointed me) is that when i'm single, i'm a hermit and that extremely displeases me.  maybe i live too far from anything and fancy that my roles in life (grad student/on-call waitress/runner wannabe/doting daughter) restrict me from being the free and wild partying single girl that i would otherwise be....  (another thought: i'm getting old and  want  to stay in....)  not to say that the past couple months haven't been amazingly rewarding.... (1) i'm near completiong of my thesis (idle minds would wonder if i couldn't have finished four months ago....) (2) i can see a future for myself, what i might be doing after the summer is over (yes, i'm being deliberately mysterious until i make a decision) (3) concentrating on my friends - to the best of my lousy ability (4) otherwise refining my ideas on what i'm looking for in a guy the next time around - hoping the next time is the last....  it doesn't hurt my spirits to have had a really full weekend: -  friday  - worked at the restaurant after working at school; -  saturday  - did some school work before indulging in a wicked combination of company and dining (congee, it's been a long time since i last had that here!), then had an esl session followed by a really hard night of work at the restaurant (a lot of stair-climbing all night), and  wind-down  by going clubbing with thuy; -  sunday  - recovering from saturday (my quad muscles were beat), doing precious little work, and chillin' :D

       today, my sister and i are getting our graduation photos done.  think of them as  glamour shots !  fun, fun... i like getting my picture taken when i'm ready for it!  beforehand, we went to  urlLink curry village  for some satisfying indian food....  they have a lunch menu where chicken dishes (tandoori, madras, tikki, "curry", korma, or bhoona) are 7.95 and come with soup (mulligatawny) and rice or naan.  most of the vegetarian dishes (chana masala, sag paneer, aloo goobi, mixed vegetables) were 6.95 and also come with soup and salad.  we ordered chicken korma and chana masala and samosas (2 per order, 4.95).  the soup was okay.  very thin and decidedly more vegetable broth with curry added than a hearty mulligatawny.  at least it was ample sized served in a bowl.  the samosa, as usual, were good - a well-spiced mix of carrots, potatoes, and peas.  you don't even need meat in those.  finally, our eyes bulged when we saw the size of the main dishes.  were they ever generous!  we would have been quite full getting only one dinner and splitting it!  both were really good - hearty.  chana masala was slightly spicy hence i didn't get halfway through it before sis was done more than half hers and we traded dishes.  the chicken korma was creamy goodness - i didn't think the chicken was fabulous (a bit more dry than i would have liked).  there is no doubt that the  best prices for indian food  can be found at curry village.  the competition in halifax isn't so big so it's nice to get a truly good deal here.  if i was living alone, i wouldn't think twice about getting a doggie bag for the half of the food that remained.  the waitress did screw up and charge a dollar extra for the vegetable lunch and we don't gripe over a misplaced dollar but it's relatively a large screw-up when there were only two different prices to remember on the lunch menu....  so, we paid up, and deducted the same amount  (losing on the taxes), from her tip.... ($2 instead of 3.)  sorry!  at my restaurant, we try our utmost to get the prices right when we have sooo many prices to remember, so we hold a higher standard for other waitresses.

       so i was chatting with someone in t. ( have ) who's never met someone in hali ( have-not ) before and i do the usual and make this place sound sooo deprived.  he asks, "is there chinese tv?"  nope.  well, you can get  urlLink fairchild  via satellite.  you need satellite to get it in toronto, too, unless you have resourceful contacts....  they have cfmt, though, but i hardly call that chinese tv.... (in addition to chinese news, there is russian news, korean news, and reruns of seinfeld....)  he asks, "do you have bubble tea?"  nope.  well, standalone shops here wouldn't fly in the least bit because... there aren't enough hk or taiwanese people here.  there are two traditional chinese-canadian restaurants offering it but not as a main menu item.  there is no chinese radio here either, and that's a sore point.  but enter the internet....  getting all ready for that day when i have high-speed connection 24/7, i've been exploring my chinese radio stations (through  urlLink winamp  and associated  urlLink shoutcast , thank you).  as mentioned previously,  urlLink ai qin hai  is an awesome station that tides me through the rough times at work (48kbps, 32 max) - very disappointing when this maxes out on me   urlLink koish.com  is even cooler but has usually a full server - will list the currently playing song (48 kbps, 60 max)  diazonium chinese songs - another chinese pop station - lists the currently playing song - pretty varied artists (64kbps, 50 max)   hiradio live  -  cantonese  (hk) radio with spoken sessions and music -  i love love love it ... except i have only seen the station listed once (24 kbps, 32 max)   coph  - cantonese opera home page - for my mum's benefit (24 kbps, 30 max)  "taiwan POP... get ready to leech! (t1 connection @ ucsd)" - that's what it says - not a varied list of artists, unfortunately (128 kbps, 5 max)   now if i could get my streamripper to work... life would be complete and bliss....  despite  being here.  (i got it to work :D)

        urlLink [this]  is something i would do.  maybe not in a health club because i  despise  all the girls that come out for trending things like  dancercise  and  aerobox ... or  cardiofunk  that lures out hordes of frilly little trendoids.  no... i would even buy a pole to install in my rec room (and able to discreetly fold away).  not for my husband's benefit, hell no....  for my benefit .  btw, i started liking to dance sexily back when paula abdul was hit.  remember "cold-hearted"???

        fear of hikes   in the battle of wyn vs. nature, i do believe nature won.  i'm wiped out.  it was 14 rough kilometers....  we went to  urlLink cape split  - me and eight labbies.  we formed the  fellowship of the hike .  and if we were actually a fellowship, i was definitely a bumbling hobbit, very conscious of the rough terrain, in contrast to dave, lithe, scampering about, very elfish....  i'm reminded of why i don't do this often.  on the plus side, it was  excellent  terrain experience since that is not exactly provided by daily runs on a treadmill.

        no more....     shortbread cookies - my not-so-secret-anymore pleasure with afternoon (green) tea  egg rolls - my restaurant's egg rolls are  yummmmmy  but kinda against the idea of  high-performance athlete .   lol.   free pieces of chocolate (e.g., truffles, chocolate bars) - exceptions: cookies containing chocolate, drinks containing chocolate... because i can limit those  salt snacks - basically, chips - i'm the kind of person who craves salty stuff more often than sweet stuff   not to say that these are daily obstacles but ones that have been pushing me over, ones that i can turn down one craving at a time.  like by drinking a bottle of water, or another cup of tea.  yeah, that's the plan.  henceforth these are  forbidden foods .  (it is possible that my lousy sleeping habits are also culprit in negating the effects of eating alright and exercising a lot....  looked it up.  it is  definitely  possible.  getting enough sleep is part of a weight loss program!)  why am i doing this?  it's been twelve or so weeks of training (nearly) according to the schedule and i haven't lost a pound.  i refuse to believe that someone my height (5'0") should plateau at my weight.  you wouldn't look at someone my height who can get into a size 3 and think i weigh this much....  i haven't gone hungry these past twelve weeks, so that is likely the problem.  here's a little gem from  urlLink dr. phil's diet book  (introduced on  urlLink dietchick's site ):  "think about deprivation another way: by overeating, you're depriving yourself of a healthy weight, an attractive appearance, self-regard, and peace of mind."

        work blues   i'm trying like mad to win a $75 gift certificate to  urlLink hamachi house  with c100's  at-work-song-of-the-day .  yesterday some woman in sackville (insert scrunched-up face at the mention of  sackville ) won and she was thrilled because of the two  spray-on tanning sessions  that also form part of the prize package.  (insert wyn rolling her eyes.   what a flake. )  "oh, i heard that place is good, too."  (insert wyn wailing in frustration.   "good??!!"   try one of the best in halifax, and there finally are enough japanese restaurants for some competition.)  darnit, i get several hits a day at my restaurants site and it seems that half of them are searching for this very hamachi house.  i'm giving them free advertising and still can't seem to win a darned radio contest.  (sometimes, i don't have a hope in winning because i don't recognize the song.  like, what's this matchbox 20 "unwell" song?)  speaking of which, i got a new url for the restaurant site:  urlLink http://clik.to/hfxdining .  someday i might make a really cool site, but now it's just an improvement to get a new (manageable) url.  get  urlLink google toolbar  and turn on the pop-up ad blocker and my new url will seem no different from the old site. :p

        survivor + fear factor + amazing race = ....?   apparently, it all adds up to the  urlLink bell chase .  and it's coming to halifax!  (after it's been to vancouver, edmonton, calgary, toronto, ottawa, montreal, and quebec city.)  i don't mind admiting to watching  urlLink amazing race .  it's a great reality show because it takes you all around the world in a matter of weeks.  ahh....  and don't you find that you wonder if you could hack it too as a contestant?  and  who  would be the best partner suited for you?  and  what  caption would they put under you and your partner... lifelong friends, dating,  student lifers  (i.e., grad student)....?  i know i can't go on amazing race (or bell chase)... i can't ride a bike!  the race would end there and then for me.  :(

        mental fortitude   ... which i'm lacking....  :(   sundays are supposed to be my long runs, starting from 8 miles on week 1 and building up to 20 miles (if i were still considering a full marathon).  but i'm only considering a half-marathon so maybe i only need to build to half as much (10 miles)... or maybe do a mock half-marathon every sunday if i'm that ambitious....  but at the rate that my treadmill is reading (5.5 mph), it takes me 2 hours and 22 minutes to complete a half marathon and i'm afraid to say that my willpower to just keep running (never mind i'm  really  exhausted) maxes out at 1 hours and 40 minutes -  100 minutes  - when the treadmill automatically turns off because it can't go past  99:59 .  maybe i shouldn't go out on saturday nights until 4 a.m. ....  yeah, i don't have any plans on saturday and we'll see what effect that has....  but the more likely problem is that i can't stand the boredom for that long... even if a  urlLink good movie  is playing.   in other news   thesis work bites.  i'm fighting tooth and nail (??) to finish by july.  i wouldn't be getting anywhere in this social mecca known as my graduate area if it weren't for the soothing sounds of  urlLink ai qin hai .   from  urlLink meet joe black    joe: how do you know it's love?  quince: because she knows the worst thing about me, and it is still okay.   too tired to philosophize right now (er, me?? philosophize??).  but just add that to my ever extending list of criterion....

       it is 99% definite that i'll be participating in the  urlLink marathon by the sea  10 weeks from now.  i don't know exactly what the other 1% is riding on... but i don't like sounding so definite until i've registered!  i've posted a  urlLink new schedule  on the right navigation bar.  this could disturbingly continue forever....  of course, improvements must be made to better your life, right?  so here are the following improvements i'm striving for:  improving my pace.  my race pace was 6.21-minute-kilometer (or 9.94-minute-mile) and i wonder if it is unreasonable to strive for a 9-minute-mile? at the very, very least, to do better than last race's time: 2:11:16.2 this time, i'll eat "more healthily" which sounds ambiguous here but has a meaning, i swear!  basically, less junk food and less snacking. i managed to train for 18 weeks last time and not lose a pound.  can you believe that??

       "imagine an american-born chinese chick who manages to attract every sort of unbelievability in shanghai, then attempts to make sense of it in her writing -- all to stay sane."   urlLink judy   urlLink posted  about what someone in her comments dubbed  post expat adjustment disorder  seeing as she just returned to california from an 8-month stint in shanghai.  i've been over there so i know the magnitude of difference between china and canada/the states.  we take all of our amenities, all the space we have, and our freedom for granted.  to a lesser extent, i even feel it going from one canadian city (like toronto) to here.  sometimes i feel like we are so oblivious.  added another blog-read:  urlLink lisa (a.k.a. hybrid girl) .  her tagline is a george eliot quote:  "it is never too late to become who you might have been.   (quite reminds me of a thomas edison quote:  if we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves. )  i can understand some parts of her life like my own, the rest (partying it up in l.a. because she's right there in l.a.) is enticingly educational.  :p  a while ago, i guess i forgot to mention this, i added  urlLink michelle's  and  urlLink stef's  sites.  they post about  girl things  so i can learn like the newbie i am.  :p  i like to read blogs from the very start - to  know everything  but i can't do that with well-established blogs liked  urlLink lori's  site or  urlLink jenny's  site.  i can't remember when i started reading any longer and i certainly can't figure out how long it had existed before i started....  found through  urlLink blogwise.com  the following two blogs that are relatively new (under four months old):   urlLink zai mei guo , it's not my style to either read a caucasian's view of my culture or to comment passionately on someone's site.  but rather being an expat in hk/china, he's observing primarily on the chinese people he sees in america, something i can relate to.  his main personal source is his girlfriend who is from china and i like to think i'm providing a chinese-canadian perspective that is otherwise unavailable to him.  my sister thinks i'm acting out on my cultural identity crisis.  :S  urlLink goddess in purgatory , tales of a chinese immigrant in new york, interesting perspectives from a fresh newcomer  finally, i've also added a guy (!!),  urlLink flying panda , a toronto-ian and UW survivor (wooooow), for a daily dose of  urlLink the city  life.

         before neptune, k and i went to  urlLink symposium  for a  quick  dinner.  why symposium?  we were holding a coupon clipped from  urlLink the coast  for one complimentary "dinner entree" with the purchase of another dinner entree of greater or equal value.  (see  urlLink below  for the review.)  i cannot possibly review a play but i can tell you some of my thoughts running through my head while it was going on....  they have really nailed down feline balletic motions huh... it's been a while since i did any flexibility training and these cats are really flying and contorting the set is a bit surreal and stylized for a grubby wharf the costumes are really sleek.  i thought there would be more  fur  but, no, the costumes were really sleek and i was trying to remember the characters (didn't feel as if names were being given) by their distinctive "markings" when you go to enough  urlLink neptune  plays, you start recognizing the actors from one play/musical to the next.  for example, we recognized pamela gordon from  cabaret  and bill perry from  the rocky horror picture show  by their voices and actions before we recognized their faces oh... now i know the context to that song, "memory"  hey , next neptune season is going to really good, too; they are showing  "diary of anne frank" ,  "cat on a hot tin roof" ,  "annie" , and  "chicago" , and that's just to name a few! i've been to  symposium's  patio before (i think it was just last year) and that was all-round forgettable.  it was windy in the tunnel created by the martime life tower.  today, naturally, we went indoors where the tables were clothed, and candles adorned the tables and dividers.  just like at the pacifico club, there was a lot of trees lending the feel of being in a secluded patio.  we weren't sure if we could get two pasta dishes because those fell under the menu category of "pasta & entrees" while there was another "dinner entree" section.  we settled on getting the cornish hen ($26) and roasted duck ($25).  (one entree was free!)  note: we were taken aback when the server asked me how i wanted the duck.  i recognized that an appropriate answer was one of "well done," "medium," "rare," or something in between but it seemed an odd question to us.  when we roast duck for chinese cuisine, it just comes well done....  i ordered it medium-well because, well, that's how i order my steaks!  my roasted duck was presented with about ten pieces of sliced duck in a thin layer of cranberry  jus  surrounding a cylinder of risotto and julienned sauteed (yellow) squash and zucchini.  the duck was chewy and we don't know whether it was because it was medium cooked or because of the way it was roasted that is alien to us... tasty, nonetheless.  i don't even like cranberries but it was nice flavouring.  the risotto was pretty scary-looking, this congealed brown mass.  the first bite was okay, but quickly it became too salty and cheesy.  we looked at the cornish hen and admired how big it was... and wondered why the legs were tied together.  have no fear, it was stuffed and we couldn't identify the taste of the stuffing.  i could describe it though: lumpy white goo with bits of red stuff.  we also couldn't identify the marinara sauce, there was an added spice.  the dark meat was very smooth and distinctive while the white meat tasted more like chicken.  is this normal for cornish hen?  like roasted duck western-style, cornish hen is somewhat alien to us.  i enjoyed the roasted duck and we agreed it was better than the cornish hen, especially in the garnish and sauce.  but $26?  not really worth the price if we had to pay full price for it... sorry!  for the same price per entree, we got seafood and truly impeccable fine dining service just the day before.  they ended up deducting only $22 (instead of $25) off the bill.  we don't know why but we were in a rush to watch the play!

          i was pretty nervous going in on a few grounds....  being utterly alone throughout the race appearing an oddball running all alone, bopping to my music... and at the back of the whole pack passing out at the 1:30:00 mark.  that was my longest run in the past month.  or otherwise cramping up. falling further and further behind the 2:15:00 pack, or inadvertantly trying to keep up with them (my projected time was 2:30:00) and screwing myself up (i trained at 5.6 mph while the 2:15's were running at 5.86 mph) getting too much or not enough water failing myself....   after the friendship run   marathon runners were invited to participate in the  friendship run  lead by john stanton, founder of  urlLink the running room .  really nice and affable guy who has run in 56 half or full marathons.  he gave us some advice and three power words to repeat to ourselves during the race:   relax.  power.  glide.   he's the  2:15 pace bunny , that is, he runs at a pace to finish the marathon after 2 hours 15 minutes.  my heart fell because i wanted to be a part of his group!  fortunately, there will be a 2:30 pace bunny, too, so i just have to stay between these groups.  it was kind of surreal to be in the running room, wearing a  urlLink running room jacket , surrounded by all these runners most of whom were also wearing running room gear.  i realized that the photos of people modeling running room gear included pictures of him.   it felt kind of cultish.    would you believe that i was concocting my blog entry while running in the race?   here are some thoughts....   i  was  at the back of the pack in the chute.  identified the 2:30 pace bunny (to recognize her) and was the 2:15 pace bunny (i could easily recognize him). learned that running alone in a marathon is not bad.  i could weave around in the crowd at my leisure, not one else having different bursts of energy speeding or slowing me down. it really is an individual thing, trying to better yourself.  bringing along music and being a "loner" was totally acceptable afterall. the whole city seemed to shut down for us.  i was pleased to see all sorts of people come out to cheer us on at all points of the route. comparing my pace with some random person's wasn't a good idea - i have no idea what their pace is and they can be as erratic as i was.  bruising your ankle  the night before against your bed frame is  not  a good idea. at the pace i had (6.21 minutes / km), it didn't seem like the race was a pressing issue but you are constantly wearing yourself down.  it was tempting to let rest periods become closer together and for longer but... then you consider how much you want it all to be over, to just go home.  and so you keep going, keeping the rest intervals sufficiently far apart.  i learned in that what it means to be in competition with yourself. john stanton told us about how we'd hit a wall around 1:30 when you switch your fuel source from readily-available sugar to your stored fat.  and it would be a lowpoint... oh was it ever! had a  half hour of cramps .  thought i was going to seriously blow even my worse-case time, (2:30)... but i was still ahead of the 2:15 pace bunny, which baffled me thought i could do the last kilometer straight but i bailed about 500 m from the finish line for a break... so at least i could be running past the finish line! you get a  medallion  for completing the race! :) i couldn't have done it without my mp3 player... or little competitions with people around me. having a bag check was invaluable.  i totally needed  a blanket , long pants, and a dry shirt.  could also have used a change of shoes and socks! it was kind of surreal to finish.  i was in such a daze.  so, in summary,  i would do it again .  in fact, i'll definitely come back next year to do it!  and check out for a marathon to train for near where i'll be next year.  and having achieved the above time (the fastest time was 1:09:something), i have to improve upon it.  in any case, i'm proud of myself ( pat, pat on my back ) for doing better than my predicted time (2:30) that would require going slower than on the treadmill and better than my calculated time (2:19, based on treadmill speed).  that would basically mean my dreams were fulfilled!  (i'm considering doing the halfer at the  urlLink marathon by the sea  in saint john, nb, on august 8 th .  i think i've gone insane.)   another packed week coming up....   now life can go back to normal... except next week is anything but normal what with my sister's convocation on tuesday with a  urlLink fabulous dinner  and  dessert  planned, watching  cats  at  urlLink neptune theatre  on wednesday preceded by dinner (of course), if time permits, m. and i will get around to rock-climbing this week (because we didn't last), and continued  mad thesis writing .  i haven't even figured out "spontaneous" activites yet....  will it ever end??

       i can just feel it.  two more runs until  urlLink the big run .  they're all pretty short, too, 6 miles, and 2 miles (i did 4 miles this morning).  then the  biggie - 13 miles  on sunday.  that means sleeping at appropriate times starting yesterday at 11:30 p.m.  so that getting up at 5:30 a.m. fully revitalized on saturday and sunday is not a problem.  m. and i are going to go rock-climbing on thursday.  one of those crazy things to  add colour to your life , you know?  otherwise, there are  two weeks to the end  and, honestly, i thought i would be a bit further than i am now but... it's salvageable.  so, it's  mad thesis-writing  for me this week and next....  i also have to make a decision this week about where i'm going to be in the fall - toronto or vancouver.  what will i decide??

       (written thursday night.)  (pics are at the  urlLink photo album .  click on "miscellaneous party pictures.")  i'm slightly buzzed right now.  imbibed a glass of white wine and a martini in a great night toasting mona's pending departure from the fold, from the  sex and the city gang .  i remember meeting my two girls mona and vinnie in summer school.  i had just returned from toronto and was totally frustrated with being in halifax.  i didn't want to make friends to tie me to this dumpy town.  mona took the initiative and asked me to be her partner for chemistry lab while i would have rathered do the labs alone. and we all laugh about how i was such an  ice queen  and otherwise how much more angsty we were a whole five years ago to this summer.  how we perceive time is so relative!   five years  is an awfully long period of time but they seem to have flown by.  somehow we all got our bachelors and (for the most part, for the moment) our master's as well.  it was invaluable to have the girls on the same path i was on.  but really, thinking about how much we changed... we mellowed, shared our dreams and desires, partied together, laughed together and cried together.  tonight we went to  urlLink fireside  ( urlLink review  follows) to toast mona's job and to send her off in style.  she always gets the best turn out because you can't help but come to love her!   bye-bye mona!  we'll miss you intensely while you are in sunny california!!   the  fireside  meal....  i started off with a glass of their cheapest house wine (jost) at 3.95 a glass.  i'm not a conoisseur and i was able to daintily sip at it so it was all good....  vinnie and i both ordered tarragon chicken crepes with which you have a choice between caesar or spinach salad.  i chose my usual spinach salad.  9.95 for the entree.  it was good.  the salad was okay, they were accomodating and paid careful attention to those of us who didn't want bacon bits for various reasons.  the crepes were delish with not-too-rich tarragon sauce over two crepe rolls filled with tender and moist chicken and peppers.  we ordered an assortment of martinis (5.95 each).  mona got banana split, i got sour apple (vodka, melon liqueur, and amaretto), vinnie got blue stride (milky, blue, and you can hardly taste the alcohol), and i don't know what tammy's was called again.  it was lip-smackingly yummy and truly appropriate on a  girl's night out .  three of us ordered chocolate concoctions (regular-sized for 3.95), desserts to drool over even though they aren't particularly novel.  it is really the perfect size, a slice of brownie, heated, with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a generous dollop of whipped cream.

       the day before, i slept shortly after midnight in order to wake up at 6:00, catch a bus at 7:30 and get to school at 8:30.  read a couple chapters from  urlLink portrait of a lady  while bopping to vanessa mae's  urlLink storm .  took lunch with w at  urlLink downtown coffee exchange .  with some prodding, i was super productive and tied up some loose ends, hopefully pleasing  my very first customer  with my system.  caught a bus at 8:15, read some more  portrait  while bopping to the canto/mand-pop music on my mp3 player.  i felt independent and like a real student.  for the first time in a while i was able to do things completely on my own time.  yesterday, slept around 11:30 in order to wake at 5:30 without much prodding from my alarm clock.  ran from 5:55 until 6:55, showered and washed my hair and  straightened it  and caught a bus at 7:30.  legs are a bit sore but i feel pretty  :)  and tight (aight?) for a biggish day lies ahead: lab meeting, food fair, esl session, mona's going away dinner, and some work in there as well!  you see, my life has turned over upside down (no longer nocturnal) and it's refreshing.  and that is about all that is going on in my life....

       my first  urlLink icq  number was a  mere   11710525 .  funny how i can recall the number.  unfortunately i can't access the account because (1) i can't remember the password, (2) i can't remember which email addy i signed up with, and (3) most likely that email address is defunct / i've forgotten the password to it anyways!  my new uin is this horrible large number  244235310 .  i might not remember that number since i've migrated to  msn  and rarely use icq; good thing we can sign into icq with an email address....  had to sign up for one because the supervisor wants to have reigns over us....  lol .  i'm just kidding.  he's really sweet.  otherwise... not much to report.  i mean, stuff's happening and i'm really stressed out and an imminent decision (or two or three) loom in the near future.  tell you more as it comes along....

       did you you know they are playing  pacman  on the  urlLink streets of new york city ?  on a related note, when i was over at m. & d.'s, they broke out this interesting  urlLink games console  that you hook up to your television and play pacman, galaxian, and other really  retro games  that pioneered them all!  i didn't participate because i really suck at video games but it's a great addition to a party!

       the distance i ran yesterday in 90 minutes was 13.5 km translating into a speed of  5.625 mph  and that means that i'm on track to finish a 13-mile half-marathon in  2 hours 19 minutes .  yup-yup.  :)  two more weeks until race day.  i'll do the same run next saturday but i doubt i will be increasing my pace over the next two weeks....  it's alright.  2 hours 19 minutes is still under the  2 hours 30 minutes  goal i submitted with my race registration.

       this morning, my sister went to have breakfast at  urlLink cora's , she dropped me off at the corner of robie street & spring garden in halifax.  instead of having a heavy breakfast of crepes and waffles, i stretched at the corner (high volume of traffic, relatively) and proceeded to run home.   the goal:  to get home and vege for as long as i had been running.  i don't quite know what my motivation will be come race day since we're doing one big loop.  i guess i'll hope for 2.5 hours to pass and hope that i will also have crossed the finish line by then!  you see, the drive to school takes about 25 minutes and some of it is nearly highway speeds.  we figured the distance is perhaps 17 kilometers and would have measured the route's length exactly except the bridge was off-limits.  (i'll calculate it tonight when the bridge is open again.)  that's right.  i've lived in this city for 23 years and i've never walked or jogged across the bridge.  it was not as momentous as i thought it would be but it was really nice indeed to feel so close to my city.  now i know which side the sidewalks are on!  toyed with the idea of getting a watch that would beep at intervals i pre-set, say, after ten minutes to signal a 1-minute break which also ends with a beep.  i haven't even investigated the prices but can imagine them being wildly inflated because other features like heart-monitor and thermometer are also included.   my solution:  run for the duration of about three songs on my mp3 player and walk for a minute at the beginning of the fourth song.  it is dependent that i don't walk for too long (since i don't really have a sense for the length of a minute).  it works out because i do want to start up the next interval or else it will just take too long to get to the end!  it took in total 90 minutes to get home.  this is, happily, the same length of time it takes me to run "8 miles" on my treadmill at "5.6 mph."  i'll report again on the actual distance because i'm really interested, too.  i do think it is around 8 miles.   whew!   because during this first week of outdoor running i have been intensively worried that my outdoor running pace is vastly slower than my treadmill pace!  yay, i'm no longer so tempted to drop out of the marathon!

       it kinda has a theme or you'll figure out the scope of my internet adventures....   when i queried what was on oprah, my sister responded, "you wouldn't be interested in it."  how wrong she was....  in the part of the show i caught, one couple went from being fabulously well-off (they made $190,000 a year... usd) to getting pregnant and halving the income to losing the last income to making a comeback with one $50k/year salary.  the financial roller coaster sounds terrifying.  but it did touch on things that worry me - my finances as an independent person, sharing finances with my husband-when-i-find-him, the cost of raising kid(s), and saving for retirement.  i  know  it's not so hard and it was incredibly reaffirming that if you can bear the small sacrifice now, you can have a life of security.  it was a most useful episode -  how to be a millionaire couple  [ urlLink link ] here's a  useful tip : instead of living from paycheck to paycheck, try to live off every second paycheck.  in an episode of scrubs the week of apr.25, carla recited her wedding vows and she said something like, [warning, severe paraphrasing here]  "i've made mistakes in the past but it's alright now.  i've met you and they are brushed aside.  because it was those mistakes that enabled me to meet you."   even before this episode, i know that this circuitous route i feel like i'm taking in life is not without reason....  while strolling through a  urlLink chapters , i scanned the magazines looking for the seemingly-defunct  banana magazine .  into what section does magazines for asian-american women fall?  you'd think "women's magazines" but you'd be mistaken.  my eyes rested upon  urlLink jasmine magazine , launched in the fall of 2003.   slick.  refreshing.  canadian.   (subscriptions for americans also available.)  i've already purchased my year's subscription (4 issues for $14.95CAD).  i suppose  urlLink jade magazine  is the american counterpart.  i've been reading it online for a few years now and recently purchased hard copies.  when i was reading it on paper, i finally noticed that the quality of writing is substandard... almost insulting in its simplicity.  i'm hoping jasmine doesn't disappoint.

       to not go running outdoors sooner.  henceforth, between now and  race day  (may 23rd), i will run outdoors on any non-rainy day when i am scheduled to run.  otherwise... dare i say it... the marathon is going to be one hell of a run....  oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy.....  here are the horrific discomforts sustained on the first day outdoors after a winter of indoor running (lest i should forget next year....)  back felt like it was being jarred feet cramped up shin/ankle strained totally different breathing required to sustain oneself case of wheezing hours after the run  all problems that have to be sorted out before tomorrow run.  ugh....

       wow.  on may 4, in the wee hours of the morning, i  urlLink googled   urlLink hamachi house  and found myself as the #1 ranked result.  the official homepage is ranked  eighth   now i'm all nervous about when i will fizzle.  when will i fall to #2?  (if not already by the time you read this.)  this is royally insane.  and i still haven't gone to ask for a discount.  ;-)

       here comes a long post... i can just feel it  you see, my family is a bit cloistered.  as a result, if i spend the evening out with a friend(s), even if i just go over to a friend's place and hang out there, i have  gone out .  and when my going out frequency increases for whatever reason, it is duly noted in my household.  it makes me uncomfortable to be viewed by my family as the party girl when i so am not.  but by comparison to my sister, i'm  party girl extraordinaire .  i don't even go out on a "school night," not even thursday nights.  i've been intensely good (gas prices are sky-high) and staying at home, avoiding multiple trips into the city on a given day.  now summer is begging to poke through here and i can feel suffocation coming on....  the feeling that i want to be out, to stroll downtown on sunny days.   seeing and being seen , that's still important to me.  (i can't do that in my neighbourhood.  it's about a two-hour walk to downtown, if that.  and strolling about my neighbourhood... ~shivers~ i don't want the scuzzballs all around to see me.)  something happened along the way, i can't really explain it.  i grew tired of people and my core of good friends is really tiny right now.  and living in the outskirts of the lesser twin of twin cities, both my sister and i have grown up driving to other people's houses rather than inviting people over.  i hardly even noticed that most of my closest friends don't have the ready access to a car that i have.  (i don't mind driving too much.  it's a smooth and comfortable ride cross-cities when you have a minivan.)  friday night, mona, vinnie, and i  just chilled .  it's what i want these days rather than staggering clubbing nights.  there was no alcohol involved.  i think the three of us spent only an hour together but it was one well-packed hour of conversation.   mature-ish.  sedate.  real.   saturday evening, i met up with andrew.  we had dinner at  spice urban grill  (see  urlLink below  for a review) and then went to his friends  m.  &  d. 's to just chill.  only a year ago, i would not have been inclined to join him despite his repeated insistence that  m.  &  d.  are really, really nice.  but... i'm realizing i don't know a lot of people here and it doesn't do to continue turning down the opportunity to meet people.  i knew  a.  and  p.  already but met  l. ,  s. , and the other  m. .  (sorry for the initials.  don't want to  name drop  or use other people's names without their permission.)  a year ago, i would have thought that i couldn't possibly have anything in common with andrew's friends who are uniformly  model-pretty, beer-swilling, chain-smoking, arts-oriented canadian people (maritimers) .  (gee, someone - me! - doesn't look like the others....)  but i came to realize that if there is a group of people i could possibly understand, it was maritimers.  and i can also understand these people who really are in my age group (or older).  being a grad student in science sometimes makes me feel like an alien but there was a girl our age halfway through med school, another girl just starting up her science degree, and a girl who is a statistician.  clubbing no longer holds satisfaction unless it is a method to further a relationship with someone(s).  (i mean with friends, people i already know!  not what you're thinking....)  i wouldn't have minded going down to a bar and getting to know the people together... something i was too snobby or  ice queen  to consider doing last year.  i have several people to thank for my eventual  thawing  and acceptance (finally) of maritimers and my maritimer identity.  i think i have been brainwashed afterall into thinking akin to the chinese concept of beauty.  that is, as much as we can be xenophobic and darned proud of our race, we really appreciate a pretty caucasian face as the ideal in the standard of beauty.  that's why shisheido has a line of whitening cream eagerly snapped up by asian users.  that's why amongst chinese, the eyelid surgery is considered for creating a precanthal fold... at the very least, i think it was 3M that makes a double-sided adhesive tape to tape your eyelids up....  i think i'm alright looking.  pretty smokin' in fact, in the right day, and i was pretty when i met up with andrew.  but i looked around the girls, and each appeared ethereally pretty in their pale-skinned glow and will brilliant hues of blonde and brown hair.  even through all of high school as the only chinese person in my class i didn't feel so glaringly different  physically .  thank goodness it's not an issue to me and it's just my observation....  it's not enough to want to dye my hair again.  not enough to even buy the 3M eyelid tape for fun.  i've also noticed that amongst my very few closest friends, even fewer of them are in really secure, long-term relationships.  (a dear friend in germany is in one but that's so far away to be a strong influence, sorry kiddo!)  and i wondered if that wasn't some kind of reinforcing loop.  we don't set an example for each other (yet) and so we don't know how to successfully create long-lasting  magic .  instead, we totally support each other on the prowl best.  not to say  m.  and  d.  are friends of mine but i suppose i could possibly learn something from their interaction this summer.  ********      ahhh, the long-awaited review of  spice urban grill , located at the former  le bistro  on the ground level of park victoria apartments.  we really couldn't decide where to go since big franchises were not palatable and a bar & grill with live music was too rowdy.  so we settled on spice urban grill with it's promising name and central location near spring garden road, darling street of halifax.  i noticed that in the solarium where there were tables, the floor was laid with tiles and what i can describe only as patio furniture-come-restaurant style, as in comfortable patio-inspired furniture.  i noticed the overhanging plants.  in another half of the dining room, we sat in a long booth.  from this booth, i could watch the activity at the l-shaped waitress-counter/kitchen preparation table.  to start, we ordered sweet potato fries with curry mayonaise (4.95).  mushroom caps stuffed with spinach and cheese (6.95) sounded appetizing, too, but i worried about disappointing proportions.  of course there were mussels and other "the usuals" appetizers.  for a main course, andrew ordered a pan-seared salmon with red thai curry sauce (15.95), the special of the day, while i ordered sherry mushroom chicken (14.95).  both our dishes were served with rice and vegetables.  curry mayonnaise came from a jar of the same name and the sweet potato fries were perfectly flatly cut... so you wonder why i was willing to pay $5 for mccain sweet potato fries....  andrew's fish was buried under tomatoes that were part of the curry.  the rice was the amount you could fit into a can of tuna... and was served from a mold ressembling a tuna can.  vegetables consisted of butter-sauteed string green beans.  my roasted chicken was tender and juicy in the creamy, sherry-infused sauce.  the portions were the small sizes that are supposed to make you feel as if you've hit fine dining....  we both allowed ourselves to indulge in dessert and each ordered cadix (5.95).  other tempting delights included gingerbread in lemon sauce and ginger creme brule.  (i saw the chef with a mini blowtorch caramelizing her creme brule.)  cadix is begian chocolate mousse over hazelnut praline layer and under a dark chococlate slab.  it was rich and delicious!  would have prefered to have a white chocolate slab as promised on the dessert menu though....  address: 1333 south park street

       --- warning: pics contain gratuitous chest and leg views ----  got me a wedding to go to on this weekend in beautiful cape breton.  got me a straight  urlLink black flower dress  and a more breezy  urlLink white flower dress .  both hit at the knee, and i feel fab in both.  darn, what should i do??  (wedding's not too formal.)  drat.  both dresses cost $46CAD (or $34USD, today)... woohoo!  haha, it's wednesday already and now i'm getting around to talking about the past weekend.  it's that thesis, i tell, you stupid  ball & chain .  this past weekend was kinda bust.  mona didn't get in early on friday as originally expected so i went home after some fairly fun shopping on friday evening.  that's when i got the black dress.  the white dress i already wore last year to a wedding....  wish i could score a dress that is both cheap and perfectly-well-fitting.  as you know,  the way to make yourself looking slimmer is to wear clothes that fit you well  (or perfectly) and it's hard for me because i'm severely short and muscle-y.  and i want to be smashing and i'll just have to settle on looking... cute?  saturday night, i hung out at mona's for 4 hours while people were in the motions of getting ready (read: liquoring up) to go clubbing.  i was  keepin' it real  and just dropped them off at the club instead of joining them so i could spend the rest of the, er, evening with someone else sober and keepin' it real (it was  far  better that way).  sunday, i saw mona again for the last few hours she stayed in her apartment and i thought that was better than the drunken revelry from the night before but... that's just me!

        urlLink blogger  is so great!  they implemented so many  urlLink neat features  during their last overhaul that i'm dancing with joy (nearly) and all i wanted is to get expandable posts likes you can get with MT.  i was just about to email support and suggest it but it is already  urlLink implemented  and i have to go into the stylesheet to do it....  ai, i don't have the time today to figure it out (nor do i have the time to fix the inevitable broken blog that will result at first).  it will be my next blogging challenge....

       so i was just walking down the hall in the  borg cube , er,  urlLink computer science  building and marc stops me and mentions my blog.  ~instant shivers down my spine~  (w thinks to herself: uh-oh.  what did i say?)  you know, i can't remember the last offensive thing i would have said here.  i tend to err on the side of fluffiness.  :D  he requested that i link the  urlLink fcs  from my blog in addition to my school and other stuff in the navigation bar.   to boost our ranking.   with my passing knowledge of how search engines work, i understand what he means.  .... so there ya go!  gotta love the new permalinks provided by  urlLink blogger  and the unique post url's.  this will really help when people are googling for information.   -- start gratuitous information for search engine purposes --   hi, i'm a second year graduate (master's) student at the faculty of computer science of dalhousie university (halifax, nova scotia).  this is rather counterintuitive a situation because my undergraduate degree happens to be in biochemistry and chemistry and i'm about the least cs-type grad student in my year or all years, for that matter.  if you're interested in all sorts of disciplines in computer science, you're in luck: our six- (or seven-?) year-old faculty is a hub of research activity in a host of traditional computer science fields, including the two newest programs in electronic commerce and health informatics.  if you're interested in bioinformatics, you're in luck, too, as we will have in fall 2004 a graduate degree in bioinformatics / computational biochemistry.  you could say i started my degree two years too early but it is a greater honour to be my supervisor's first grad student!   -- end gratuitious information .... --

       i have  finally  churned out a blessed first draft.  it's awful.  i promised myself and my supervisor that the next time he sees all of it, it will be worlds better.   worlds and worlds and worlds....   things are not quite so off-schedule... easy to say when the schedule is not rigid, huh?  :P  nothing to do but to prepare for a presentation a week from today and endless combing through the first draft in order to churn out a second one for next week.  freedom, the prospect of it, in contrast with daily dreariness, is what keeps me going.  otherwise, my life is pathetically boring right now.  no fun summer activities accomplished as yet.  this is how bad things are: in order to hang out, w and i had a  laundry date  at 7 a.m. on monday....  (hey, it turned out to be loads of fun!  pardon the pun.  :P)  we ate at a cafe adjacent to the laundromat.  i said i wouldn't review it but i can't entirely resist.... just a note that  cafe vienna  has got quick service - hey, you don't want to stay longer than your laundry - and breakfast for cheap, a greek/arabic selection, and a colourful character for a waiter....  this coming weekend is party weekend: mona is coming home (yay!) and next weekend we're going to cb.  i have to take a day off from work next week (canada day holiday) for a family road trip thingy to digby or somewhere or other.... (besides looking forward to the events themselves, i'm looking forward to photo ops :D)  and nary but work in between....

       after a long day at work (saturday 4 till 11:30), the perfect reward was to get to hang out with friends and unwind in a downbeat kinda place.  initially i thought i was up for a place a little more upbeat and slick.  we ended up at  urlLink [stage nine] , which opened last week in the old  copabana  spot.  the 'lax place was just what i needed.  when it was copa, i don't think there were so many rooms (perhaps i did not explore enough back then) but stage 9 has a smoking room with fat, comfy, brown leather sofas.  the main room was "upscale" but i was used to it from copa days; it's just like a dimly lit restaurant.  apparently we went to hear dale murray's band who is blue rodeo-esque.  it was cool....  used to be i wanted to dance up a storm and relish my body that i work so hard on during the week with running.  but sedatedly hanging out is starting to grow on me.  you get more of an emotional connection with the people you're with and that is increasing in its importance to me.  the other way i see it is i'm just growing up.  for the past three years i have wholeheartedly resisted hanging out with andrew and his friends.  didn't think i could stand a tame get-together amongst friends and going to a dive of a bar to kill off the night.   i thought i was too sophisticated.   i've learned that sophistication isn't your lack of maritime accent or the fact that you go to big clubs: it's grace and poise and being steadfast to your values.  i'm a little regretful that i didn't take up his offers but i realize now that i wasn't ready for it before.   i wasn't yet so accepting of my east coast nature,  thinking it pointed to only bad things.  it's a true friend who kept on persisting and inviting me and now i have all the summer to discover this part of my heritage before i have to leave.

       mandarin, that is.  i absolutely hope that is not true, though.  i suppose i should be doing more than five minutes a day but who has the time?  (ok, i don't.)  the original approach to  urlLink chinese conversation-a-day  was in this order:  refresh recognition of chinese characters by reading the chinese text, and guess at the mandarin pronunciation of words confirm accurate translation by looking at english text listen to audio a few times while learning the associated  pinyin   the new approach:  listen to the audio and try to figure out what they are saying even if it means listening a few times go over the chinese text to pick up the words i know how to read but don't recognize in mandarin while checking the  pinyin  get the proper translation in english listen again while following the pinyin  this new approach reflects the sad realization that i might never be able to speak the language properly.  i'm so shy, even around imperfect mandarin speakers (i.e., cbc's) to so much as say a phrase even if i can chirp in private (reading text).  initially i thought i could speak it before i could understand it spoken (my aural is weak) because speaking is a matter of recalling the  pinyin  and saying it aloud and i have a basis (cantonese) for some of the  pinyin  already.  but... i'm not so unique to be able to speak without understanding so i turn my attention to listening.  good thing the lessons have started back at the beginning and i will try my hardest to master the easy stuff and build on it accordingly.  it's kind of weird because at my university, the chinese presence isn't all that strong.  however, the last three years, i've been  immersed  in settings dominated by chinese people, first in my all-chinese honours lab and then for the past two years as a graduate student in computer science.  but did i pick anything up?  nope....  i didn't know that when i went to the university of waterloo my mother's secret desire that  this little maritimer would accidentally fall into a chinese circle of friends  as if i had grown up with them all my life.  i didn't pick my honours lab because of the ethnic composition and i certainly didn't pick my master's discipline based on the proportion of chinese students.  in any case, i was the  pariah , who looked like them but couldn't communicate with ease with them.  growing up here, we saw people half a generation older than me obtain their university degrees and head to hong kong for work.  my mum, as an immigrant, doesn't feel like your place of residence is a certainty and wants us to be prepared if the world turns upside down and people of chinese ethnicity in canada are deported back to china.  an odd idea, i believe.  so she has harped on me to learn mandarin (especially since she has zealously made a mandarin-speaking friend and listens to the  soothing  mandarin track of her vcd's rather than the cantonese track) in case i need it.  no doubt i want to learn it because it will enable me to communicate with a wider range of people.  i am open to the possibility of hooking up with a mandarin-speaker (i used to not be) and would gladly learn the language of the majority for my honey!  but one last thing: mandarin might be a better-sounding language but  cantonese will always be my first language  (learned it before english) and hence my cantonese will be many fold more soothing than my mandarin when spoken!

       just a week ago (last sunday), i was 123.  i wouldn't say i'm starving myself but i haven't had a proper dinner all week (except for friday when i was at work) partly, mostly, because i haven't been home.  if i just stay at school for about 16 hours,  some  work gets done.  and i'm following the mantra  "eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper."   this pauper can't afford dinner.  :p  i'm also running 5 times a week for at least 45 minutes each time....  oh, and i can't remember the last snack i had... i think it was over a week ago.  the darnest part is that i can convince myself out of a craving by drinking lots of (green) tea and scaring myself with the image of blowing up to a tubby 125.  i'm kind of scared to eat a morsel more than my meals.  i'm scared to eat a real dinner.  i'm so bloody short that at 116.5, my bmi is still  23.5  (healthy range is 18.5-24.9).  in order for me to have the same bmi as my three-inches-taller sister (20), i have to be even ten pounds lighter.  (yes, i realize that i'm fairly active and that i have a lot of muscle and as such i may be as healthy and fit as possible for a non-professional athlete and still not see those nice numbers  105  on the scale....)

         (finally....!)  so, in continuing our "tradition," we closed our restaurant the evening of one of the lock daughters' convocations and the whole family, all four of us, went out for dinner.  two years ago, for my convocation dinner, we went to  bish  and, boy, was that an interesting experience.  not wishing to repeat that strange experience, we went for a tried and true restaurant (that none of us have been to before): a seafood restaurant.  haha, get it?   maritimes... seafood?   the attraction: complimentary salad and mussels bar with the purchase of a main course.  considering a main staple on pubs' appetizer lists is a pound of steamed mussels for ~$7, it's attractive because we can each eat ~1 pound of mussels!  it's an upscale kind of place without attitude, bustling with many well-kempt servers who appear very used to getting affirmative answers to their query: can i get you a drink from the bar?  k got a crantini ($9), i got a glass of mouton cadet bordeaux blanc ($9), and mum got a glass of pinot noir ($ ?).  it took us a while to figure out what to order what with all the mouth-watering options for main courses.  (where i had to refer to get the accurate  urlLink food descriptions  and names!)  (oh, we ordered maritime oysters on the half shell: two baked - spinach, bacon, white wine, and parmesan cheese - and two chilled - with rasberry, shallot mignonette, and shaved horseradish root - for 2.25 each.)  eventually k decided to get the savoy wrapped halibut ($29.95), i got herb-crusted artic char ($28.95), mum ordered the baked seafood medley ($32.95), and daddy ordered the char-grilled 10-oz. beef striploin steak ($29.95) (ever the  turf  person, even at a seafood restaurant).  the salad bar was a good source of vegetables (duh) with a nice selection of (get ready for this) cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, potato salad, tomato & artichoke heart salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, pate (varying flavours), and chick pea salad (has coriander!).  a server stands on hand to cheerfully scoop a portion of mussels onto a plate with a little dipping bowl of your choice of butter, garlic butter, marinara, or seafood broth for your mussels.  the mussels weren't fabulous, 100% juicy, as you would happen upon when you order a smaller portion and were really lucky.  but all-you-can-eat means there are a lot of chances for redemption.  some rather horrifying things came out of the mussels... literally.  i found a  baby mussel  inside one of mine... which made the mussel all the more real, unfortunately.  we found a barnacle stuck to another one.  ewww....  okay, these aren't seriously bad things.  they were perfectly fine.  we would have liked a creamy wine sauce but it was not to be found; marinara was yummy (and healthier than the rest!) and seafood broth was horribly bland.  the oysters, on the other hand, were less than totally fabulous.  huh... i suppose if i wanted oysters rockerfeller, i should just order it instead....  as for the dinners....  mum was presented with a seafood medley consisting of 4 baby clams, 2 pieces of scallop, two pieces of shrimp, some grilled salmon and halibut in a tarragon-grain mustard vinaigrette.  there was also risotto (yum!) and a side of mixed greens (she didn't like it) with watercress and the like (stuff we usually eat cooked, not raw!).  she wasn't completely pleased with the fish as she was with fish from the other dishes (like mine).  k's was halibut wrapped in a lettuce leaf, seasoned with dill and presented in a carrot-dill broth.  i didn't notice the "orzo pasta."  daddy's steak was such tender goodness we all pitched in to help him finish it.  it came with a wild mushroom and potato bake (yum yum yum) on the side.  we let him enjoy the other accessories: "balsamic glazed fennel, tempura onion ring, and stilton-hazelnut butter...."  my artic char was presented as a tower with a slab of artic char holding down a slab of "hot smoked" salmon holding down a cylinder of sauteed potatoes (hash, apparently) and asparagus.  the artic char was delightfully smooth (it's not a fish i am familiar with) as was also my salmon (so mum was digging into it).  the sauce was "maple beurre blanc, and red onion jam."  the sauteed vegetables were also heavenly fragrant.  on a funny note (but much to k's chagrin): we were sharing all of out food, reaching across the table for a bite of someone's dish or to share a morsel of our own dish.  it is so (shock!) un-western behaviour but, really, what's the point of us ordering four distinct dishes if not to sample everyone else's?  maybe we were a little out of hand but it was  fun !  and we're chinese people, afterall, hello lazy susan?  five fishermen restaurant address: 1740 argyle street hours: open at 5 p.m. everyday

        urlLink    (a.k.a thursday's post-defense reveling)  (sorry, i'm a little behind but all will be revealed in time, if not in real-time.)  here's a teaser:  il mercat.  onyx.  rain.  ts2004.  tgif.   (more....)   about a week ago, i asked w to hang out with me on thursday night in anticipation that the  thesis defense  was a success.  and he totally delivered... thank you!  i passed, as i have mentioned before.  :D  to unwind, we played a game of crib.  that game i used to think was only for old people, w taught me in the past couple of weeks.  so far, i've beat him twice but the last two games, he  skunked  me good.  didn't know i had it in me, but went for a 5-mile run: 44:05.  (that translates into a 8:49-minute mile.  go me!)    we went to  il mercato  for dinner.  i was pleased as punch to be there because i haven't been there since their move to a larger location.  we ordered mussels to split between us (7.95), i ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and scallops (14.95) and he ordered the proscuitto-stuffed chicken breast (15.95).  focaccia bread arrived first, as usual, with the server pouring a blend of olive oil and balsamic vinegar in a dish for you.  at the exact right time, the mussels appeared.  the mussels' tomato/wine sauce was sensational - the best of both worlds (marinara dip and garlic-wine sauce).  we polished it off in record speed.  i tried a piece of w's chicken breast: the proscuitto was tasty and it was coated in a tomato sauce.  his entree was served with vegetables and potatoes.  mine he called "seafood chowder" to characterize the sauce.  served with three pieces of shrimp and two pieces of scallop, it was comfort food at it's best for me on a rough day.  the sauce was creamy, tomato, and a little sherry.  we were really full after dinner.  it fulfilled his critera for hearty portions and mine for a really decent dinner after a haphazard diet for the past two weeks.  the dinner cheque wasn't as high was he was used to because i had other plans for the evening....    i've been dying to check out  onyx .  the bar came to my attention primarily because we were informed they had purchased a  crystal chandelier  we also purchased, then it was interesting because it's a really upscale (for halifax standards) bar.  there are three areas in which you can hang out: (1) the "lounge" area that is right next to the street - in fact, there is a sliding door so you can walk directly into the lounge from the street - with a set of leather "ottomans" (read: no back) are lined together in a open but exclusive enclave, (2) the bar that is lit from underneath the panel - does it not blind you? and (3) tables along a wall: black leather minimalist chairs that i suspect are stackable facing the wall-lining ivory leather booth-chairs livened up with oriental-esque cylinder pillows.  there were also two armchairs in a corner and a gauze-enclosed round booth that had the exclusive enjoyment of the crystal chandelier hanging directly over the booth.  (odd, i tell you.)  i opted for the table seating because then we do not have to be socialable to either other loungers (in the "lounge") or the bartender.  it's not uncommon for people to just stroll in and get some drinks.  we were presenting with one martini menu (gray printed on black) clipped to a mojito menu.  w ordered one jade haze (alize, grapefruit juice, and others, $8) while i ordered a passionate tremblay mojito ($9, soho lichee liqueur, alize, rum, passion fruit and the standard mint stuff).  i was ecstatic to see my lagoon-looking drink served with a  blue orchid  and w's manliness was taken down a notch :p while he was sipping a drink with a sprinkling of flowers in it!  he then ordered a javanese martini and there was a real winner of a drink containing vanilla vodka, creme de cacao, and espresso - lip-smackingly yummy, and caffeinated, too!  we thought the il mercato  washrooms  were pretty nifty (individual stall-sized rooms, so small you can't even swing a cat in there) but onyx washrooms took the prize with a full-length mirror on the door, a track of mirrors about the room, a innovative t.p. dispenser, and distorting glass cubes between the men and lady's room....  to round out this jet-setting  el maturo  evening, we head to  rain  the new club that was making a fuss a month ago.  it was ladies' night and deserted.  i scouted out the decor (all-black, and quite homogenous in style) but can't see where the attitude is deserved... oh, that would explain why the aggravating  clubber-equivalent-to-a-teeny-boppers  have claimed the place.  we didn't stay long.  by foot, we wandered down to the waterfront where i think this year's full complement for the  tall ships  was already docked.  it was nice to see people out even after midnight on a thursday (rather, friday).  the  lower deck  (very bluenose kinda bar) and the various beer tents were happening.  i was a little shy around the sailors.  it doesn't seem so long ago when the tall ships were last here (in 2000) and i still feel vulnerable like back then, except i could turn away from sailors you  know  what they're thinking and cling to my big & strong companion!  we ended up at  t.g.i.friday's  for our nightcap - girly drinks!  i got an ultimate mudslide (6.95) while w got a banana split (5.25).  yum yum yum.  that stuff goes down way too easily!  and that would round out the ultra-perfect evening that was post-defense-celebration.  like i said, i didn't want anything more.... :)

       this post is in response to my wheedling commenter, his friends, and anyone in the mood for a romance story....  first off, here are a few movies that i happened upon in the past few months and they are fitting to my story:   urlLink it had to be you   urlLink serendipity   urlLink before sunrise  (haven't seen this one, but it sounds good!)  it was nearly two years ago i met him in one of my classes.  because he didn't look like he was already paired off with an assignment partner, i approached him to do the first assignment together and we worked on it "together" one afternoon.  what i mean is he and i were stubbornly trying to figure it out on our own, but utterly lost, and we sat in the same room working on it, but not helping each other (i for one was too proud to ask).  then he dropped the class and since we weren't friends and because i was a little disillusioned by our afternoon "together," i didn't know why and i didn't care.  we laugh now about how scruffy he was and how i superficially held that against him back then.  i didn't see him around much for the following years.   our worlds didn't collide.   i saw a friend of his at the gym and apparently his friend reported seeing me in my lycra tank top and shorts and added what he would like to do with me.  yeah, because i knew he was friends with this guy i thought was unsavoury, i thought slightly worse of him.... (more)   six months ago, i attended this dinner with the guy i was seeing back then and he was there, too.  i split up from my date who latched onto a colleague of his and i found myself sitting with him and while talking to another couple, i became somewhat  enamoured  with this really funny and interesting guy.  and then he mentioned having a girlfriend or doing something with his girlfriend and the bottom fell out and i was quite upset and wallowed because this really nice guy was ineligible.  well, so was i at the time!  hence the above list of movies where the protatgonists meet when they are both affianced or seeing other people.  all i can say is in the following month, i refined what i wanted in a guy, read this  urlLink amazing article  (read  urlLink the book , too), and broke up with the guy i was seeing.  everything was put into perspective why i always get disastisfied after a few months and the break-up was a couple of months overdue anyways, so it's not  this  guy's fault!  i  urlLink decided  to take time off from "dating" (3.5 months, in fact) and would have to say that i was guilty within a week of non-platonic thoughts when i went clubbing the  urlLink morning after valentine's day  and saw him downtown.  you know what?  he had just become single, too.  we exchanged msn's and that was it for a month.  i'm not gonna contact him first,  urlLink rules , man.....  shortly before my birthday, he contacted me and he happened to be at the same club later on that week and so we spent the  urlLink waning hours  of the night together.  it's funny because two months before we finally took the leap, 1.5 months into my 3.5-month dating moratorium, we were both thinking non-platonic thoughts.  but i was determined to stick with the promise to myself and  urlLink get togethers  were strictly friendly.  all the way until the end of may, 3.5 months plus 1 week.  it's now been six weeks and i'm blissful because you're always blissful in the honeymoon stage.  (i've also been reading  urlLink this book  to improve how i handle relationships and it has warned me about the stage that comes after the honeymoon stage: polarization.  in lay man's terms: the fall-from-heaven stage or "waiting for the other shoe to drop."  i'm all set for this phase, if it will come.)  here's the part that will make the girls cry: in a little over a month our "careers" will take us in separate directions.  there is a 0.01% chance he will be in the same city as me.  (because never say never.)  at best, he will be  two hours away... by plane .  i won't speculate on the chances that we will both agree to try a long-distance relationship after such a short period of time when i'm committed to where  i'm going for three years  never mind how long he's committed to where he's going.  whatever happens next month, i'll tell you about it.  otherwise, hard as it is i just try to enjoy the present.

       the  urlLink cs building  is surprisingly lulling at 5:50 a.m.  i think i'm the only person here along with the student security guard.... (more)   my issues rear their ugly head.  does that ever happen to you?  it's like i got a sock in my stomach at 4 a.m. and i couldn't sleep after that.  so i gotta get up and move.  gotta get cracking and distract myself.  i'm thinking of crashing somewhere at 9.  yeah, that'd be 5 hours since the "news."  besides the fact i'm tired right now (operating on ~2 hours of sleep) i'm always tired after five hours of morning too.

       (the title is gaelic for "a hundred thousand welcomes")  when i came back from cape breton, i didn't know what to say/write really.  it's like a dream that i'll remember very fondly.  i'm not sure i can coherently write about it all so here's the breakdown of what i will cover:  1. the drive to cb 2. impresssions on the ceremony / reception / brunch 3. general impressions / non-wedding stuff      (the pictures on the right?  i didn't take them.  it was foggy both days.  i got them off the web and "edited" them.  they are, for the most part, places we saw.)   1. the drive to cb    urlLink last summer  the lock family embarked on a canada day day trip to cape breton.  this year, who knew that i would be returning there as the honoured guest of guest of the wedding of b.j. and m.?  since we were headed to north sydney, the drive was slightly different after we reached cape breton but i was delighted in any case to see the sights as you drive by.  i didn't understand this concept of  scenic drives  until one was truly scenic (i.e., that i could appreciate).  the awesome sites are, again:  a valley stretch winding between two rising green-with-trees "mountains" complete with a clear stream running alongside the highway (this was either just before antigonish or between antigonish and canso causeway) the bluff at canso causeway that looks like huge pieces of the earth fell from the bank exposing the rock beneath; everything around it is dense with trees (on the bras d'or scenic drive) driving high above the water and looking across the lakes at the quaint towns (villages?) and seeing the green bridge that stretches across the lake crossing a bras d'or lake by the bridge we saw from afar driving along shore road in north sydney and realizing that we are looking at the open atlantic ocean in all its glory  in other words, the  majesty of nature  is greater in cape breton.  honest to goodness.  you should go.  surprise, surprise: i tend to get tired sitting still in a car but i had really great company.  it was a 4:30:00 drive to and from and so i applaud w for his stamina.  he wouldn't let me drive :( and i kid that i could have made better time.  :p   2. impressions on the ceremony / reception / brunch   it didn't really hit me we were trapped in cape breton territory until we arrived at the church and there were two big green banners and scottish music being played (instead of, say, classical music) while we waited for the ceremony to begin.  that we were  "mainlanders"  and we are greatly outnumbered by cape bretoners and the expats who had returned for the ceremony.  it was a gorgeous catholic ceremony - it is always beautiful to watch the celebration of love, the symbolic merging of two lives.  i was all set for a fancy reception - you know me: ms. lush.  it was, instead, held in a decorated fireman's club hall and really down-to-earth.  it was fun, nonetheless, because we were surrounded by people who welcomed you with their arms wide open.  truly.  that's one stereotype that is realized.  in fact, i was sitting across from real-live heavily-accented kilt-wearing  urlLink sporran -toting bagpiper-by-trade scot imported for the wedding (kidding, he was one of many friends of the family).  he was fascinating even while swearing at me.  :p  i'm just joking... i don't think he was swearing... at me.  really cool cape breton touches: (1) to get the bride and groom to kiss, don't tink your glass but get up and play a diddy on the fiddle and they will kiss and (2) the dancing commenced with line-dancing (scottish/cape breton, not country-style!).  i dearly wanted to join in but didn't because i wasn't entirely sober and hance for fear of tripping on my feet and thoroughly humiliating myself or, worse, my companion.  it's alright - next time.  ;)  it was like attending one of those infamous cape breton kitchen parties only not, uhm, held in a kitchen!  we did get to dance (to more manageable pop music), and i'm all-round pleased about that, especially since i was set slightly drunk and i've been dying to dance for weeks....  :D  the next morning, we attended the brunch and it was cool to chill the day after.  to see everyone switched into low gear and slightly hungover from the night before!   3. general impressions / non-wedding stuff   i love getting all dressed up and being grown-uppy.  (whoops, did that just come out?  funny, non-related story  urlLink here )  my companion was pretty darn good-looking, too.  ;)  usually i'm really eager to return to  the city  after an excursion to the sticks.  not this time.  i was sad to return to halifax for multiple reasons - mostly it meant returning to real life.  when we were driving up, i had expressed distaste for the idea of owning a cottage in the middle of nowhere, like if you have the solitude and (lack of) conveniences of camping.  when we were driving back, i had an about-face: a "cottage" in a really homey place like where we visited is not out of the question - and the "cottage" better have all the modern-day conveniences!  by meeting people (as opposed to the usual way the lock family are tourists), it made the idea of living somewhere other than a city/suburb seem feasible... even fun for short-stretches.  w commented that the whole excursion was like being dropped into a different culture and he's right!  i like the fact that it was a multi-day event so while i had never met the wedding couple before saturday, i left with a deep impression of their lives and i feel honoured to have been a part of their special day.  from testimonials from their friends and just talking to them i don't  know  them to any depth but i can care about them... makes sense?  that's about it folks!  :)  back to the grind again it is.   *  on sunday when i was with mona (20) and shehan (22), at ryan duffy's they told us to just take a seat.  as we selected the one where each of us could get our own comfy armchair, the server stopped us.  i thought perhaps we could seat ourselves anywhere but  that  table.  no, she thought she might have to ask us to leave and asked me for my age.  i really didn't mean to make the grimace that i made or roll my eyes slightly.  you mean i don't  look  26?!?

       we walked around the waterfront area of digby (n.s.) and tried to decide between the handful of "seafood" restaurants from their exterior and advertised specials which would be the most pleasing.   captain's cabin restaurant  looked big and had many specials advertised so we headed in.  it wasn't quite so big inside and we seated ourselves in the "fancier" side that had a burgandy tableclothes protected by a plastic sheet on the table top.  the room had a tall sloping roof lending a rustic air.  our server was also very rustic, being all touchy-feely with my parents (no worries, she was just kind of granny-like and possibly that in real life).  my father ordered the pork chops (always the "turf" guy, 8.99?).  mum ordered the pan-fried haddock (9.99).  (aside: i thought digby was all about scallops and clams but they also lay claim to the best haddock and salmon.  we were told that haddock is the cleanest fish, therefore you don't have to add much flavour while pan-frying it.)  i ordered "large" clams and chips (15.69 or so).  and k ordered a pound of pan-fried "world-famous" digby scallops (18.69).  didn't try the pork chops so i couldn't comment on it.  the clams were as expected, but not quite the heaping portion that a "large" or price would suggest.  (say, you can get clams & chips in the city for under $12.)  they were whole clams and thankfully for batter and oil, adequately tasty.  my mashed potatoes, carrots, and squash were the blandest vegetables ever.  the scallops were tiny and i personally wonder at the 1 lb. moniker.  they were okay, grilled with some butter.  same very bland vegetables.  mum got a rice pilaf so she didn't have to suffer the parsley-sprinkled mashed potatoes.  her haddock was lightly battered and then pan-fried.  in my opinion it wasn't bad but i'm also able to tolerate, even enjoy, bland cuisine.  seasoning it with lemon juice was helpful.  all in all, it wasn't so bad when you thought hard about it.  it's probably positively delicious for many of the much older, possibly local, customers.  otherwise, we are a little too young (even my parents!) for this kind of really old-fashioned cuisine.  another rustic touch: you can see your direct-from-food-broker desert in the display fridge, on plain white dishes and wrapped individually in saran-wrap....  on sunday, i vetoed our "usual" hangouts like yfm and fireside.  nothing against them but i wanted to go somewhere that i could review!  so we ended up at  ryan duffy's bar & grill  located on the upper level above swanky mini mall spring garden place.  ryan duffy's is one of those restaurants that have a swanky side and a fine dining side.  (other restaurants i can think of like this include five fishermen/little fish and salty's.)  i reason to myself that it's all the same kitchen so it's a pretty good deal....  :p  while the down-to-earth counterpart of the other two restaurants are really down-to-earth, ryan-duffy's-normal-side is pretty nice depending on where you sit, i guess: we directed ourselves to a four-person table in a sort of alcove where each of us got velvety armchairs.  i ordered duck ravioli for us to start with (7.99) and a special: seafood-stuffed salmon with dill hollandaise (12.95).  mona ordered... name of the dish eludes me at the moment... stuffed chicken (9.99?), essentially, while s. ordered chicken oscar (9.50?).  it took a while for the ravioli to arrive so we eagerly lapped it up.  there were six pieces containing minced duck meat and painted with mango/ginger sauce.  it was a "chef's own creation," and nearly divine.  it took another while for the main course to arrive (my baked dish was to blame) and when it did, i was grudgingly pleased with the presentation.  s.'s chicken oscar consisted of lobster and chicken in roll of phyllo pastry.  it looked good and garnished with julienned carrots and parsley.  mona and my dishes were colourful with sides of steamed vegetables (yellow, red, and green peppers, snowpeas, and broccoli) - this is something i appreciate - and rice pilaf - for which i have a softness.  i still haven't identified exactly what was in the "stuffing" that lay on top of the baked salmon: mushroom, fish(?), cheese....  it was very good in any case.  mona's chicken breast was stuff with spinach and cheese.  since i was sitting during the meal facing the overhanging chalkboard with the daily specials, i was considering the cheesecake: new york-style chocolate strawberry (5.95) and caved in and ordered it for us to split.  another wait followed before we were presented with with a slice of chocolate cheesecake drizzled with strawberry topping and another white sauce (like liquid icing sugar).  the cheesecake was divine.  it might not have been baked and almost had the consistency of chocolate mousse (that i adore).  chocolate + strawberry is a winning combination.  part of the reason why i picked ryan duffy's again was because i went a couple of years ago (around april, for shaf's bday), and i was pleased back then as well.  good to see they are still serving it up well!  captain's cabin 1996 ltd. address: 2 birch, digby (ns) phone: 902-245-4868  ryan duffy's steak & seafood address: 5640 spring garden road, halifax phone: 902-421-1116

        urlLink    * pb = personal best  fab-fab-fabulous weekend....   (warning: not very intellible and elegant in writing today as you will soon see.)  here's the breakdown: 1. the drive 2. the hotel 3. the race 4. the wind-down     the drive   we rented a maroon grand prix.  ugly car inside, but alright and sporty-looking from the outside.  maybe i could have been signed on for no extra charge as the  significant other  but we didn't test that clause out and i was perfectly cheerful with the role of conversaton-provider.  churchill (the dog) was along so he could spend the night with his "grandmother" (w calls himself "dad").  w is an expert driver between halifax and moncton anyways.  and i loathe long-distance driving.   the hotel   we booked a room at the  urlLink delta brunswick , the "official race hotel."  w reserved a run-of-the-mill room (rate $149/night) but they had run out so they upgraded us to the next better room (rate $300/night) for the same charge.  so we were wandering into the room and to the left upon opening the door was the usual bathroom and a little alcove with mini-bar, microwave, and coffee machine.  we walked further in and saw the plump bed (with a massive headboard with an oval mirror) and a set of plump softas and heavy mahogany coffee table.  turn to our right and there is more to the suite - an additional room beyond the open mahogany wall contained a big television, a small desk, a glass dining table,  open space , and a  whirlpool  shrouded in stone and mirrors!  i made the executive decision to just order in.  while we were driving around downtown saint john (yahoo maps proved useless on local streets, yet again), we came around again and again  urlLink vito's  so we ordered for delivery two spaghetti dinners ( carb-loading , you see)... and feasted.  ran the whirlpool and added  bubbles ... boy was that fun and ultra-relaxing.  (if there had not been a whirlpool in the suite, we would have just gone to the hot tub by the hotel pool.)  slept reluctantly at midnight... race day was up ahead!   the race   we woke up around 5:30 (somewhat reluctantly) and began the process of  hydrating  ourselves.  coffee, water, oatmeal, nectarines, the breakfast of champions.  :p  we also picked up our race packages (arrived too late the night before) and dismal because all they had left for shirts was L for me and XL for him!  it's funny how on a race day - as it happened last time - i start thinking about the next one.  i'm considering the  urlLink p.e.i. marathon  in october.  i was  nervous  though because my longest run in the past ten weeks had been 9 miles and that was two weeks before.  not only had i skipped the long run only a week before, my training had been highly erratic with only about between 3 and 4 runs a week instead of 5.  blame it on the blesssed thesis.  :p  from 7:00 until, oh, 10:00, saint john was covered in a blanket of fog.  (the decision to stay in the night before hedged partly on the anticipation of "exploring" the city while marathoning.)  the first few miles were a bit of a blur for me.  a lot of adrenalin helped propel me forwards and not too despairing that we hadn't yet caught up to the 2-hr. pace bunny.  at mile 9 (about an hour and a half in), w took off (we still hadn't caught up to the 2-hr. pace bunny but we hadn't fallen back to the 2:15 pace bunny either) leaving me to face my  wall  and the most difficult 2 miles alone.  that's alright.  (we had trained mostly separately and he had trained for an all-out finish while i never risk pushing myself too much for fear of collapsing.)  like the last marathon, i trained alone and while it is a competition with yourself and not a "social event," it also helps to have people around you similarily pushing themselves.  their presence silently eggs you to continue on because they are as well.  (well, to make his target time, w sped past them and kept a tally of how many he passed.)  we would laugh when it was over about this massive bridge (later identified as the harbour bridge) around mile 11 that seemingly stretched on forever.  we were both of us alone at this leg of the race and not giving up half way on the uphill was a huge mental challenge!  we both got over it (pat, pat on our backs) and were rewarded pleasantly with a downhill incline towards the finish line!  last time, i was horribly disappointed when i received my finish line photo to see what demented look i had and hopefuly this time will be better since i was wearing a more streamlined shirt, let my hair down so only two ponytails on the side remained, and was waving and smiling to w (who finished earlier) just before the cameras.  :)  my final time:  2:02:19.2 , an unexpected improvement of  9 minutes  from the  urlLink last time .  w's final time was  1:57:41.7  and i'm immensely proud of him for completing it under 2 hours.  (that's my next goal.)   the wind-down   food was aplenty at the finish line: pizza (vito's did well), fruit, juice boxes, water, gatorade, cookies, chips, etc.  funny - as soon as we stopped the pain set in.  muscular and joint pains through w's leg's and sore-as-hell ankles reduced me to hobbling status.  you know what that means....?  another dip in the whirlpool.  squeezed too many bubbles in it was quite amazing.  too bad for the noon check-out time.  :(  we stopped again in moncton to pick up churchill (i have never seen him so excited to see us, he was practically beserk.) and further unwind like vegetables on the lazy-boy sofa.  i got a driving tour of moncton (pretty and distinctly more quiet than halifax) and we head back home....  it was a wonderful experience.  not just the run that was  sooo  satisfying and not just the awesome hotel suite but the little things like trying to navigate ourselves out of that little city and coffee stop halfway between the equator and the north pole (stewiacke) because w fondly remembers mastodon ridge and scooping bubbles out of the tub and trying to neatly feed churchill a sugar timbit and sharing a lot of  "firsts"  and an otherwise unforgettable experience.

       i was so excited for this week to come along (post-defense and all) but it's going to be pretty bad.  we have  relatives  visiting starting today, which means re-exploring halifax haunts and a  trip to p.e.i. .  (at least there will be pictures!)  that means i'm out of the office until sometime next week.  this weekend is  urlLink marathon weekend  in saint john.  downside: oh boy, i'm  sooo  ill-prepared this time.  upside: another getaway that i have been looking forward to for  months .  housing issues are plaguing me and so are other weighty matters....  :(   oh, and i can't seem to get rid of that  read more...  option without getting rid of all of them.  so i'm going to end this post to curb the complaining.
