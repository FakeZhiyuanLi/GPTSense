      Stink ~ I am SO not getting good at this!! The last two day's I've written considerably less than riveting blah blah blah, and then managed to delete it before getting it up and "published!" Crazy!  So, I'm having this total shopping craze. Today I bought a pair of Birkenstocks and a pair of Danskos. FAB! They're totally a two-fer compared to buying them retail at Nordstroms! Can you say EBAY! They're SO cute! My little brother is getting married in August in Washington DC, and, my big brother and I are gonna totally do the "tourist thing!" AND there's this incredibly gorgeous pink leather Helen Welsh handbag I'm thinkin' I absolutely can't live without! OH MY GOSH it's way too expensive AND way too fab! It's still there on the rack - and there isn't one on Ebay... sigh...  I'm completely excited - there's a Samoyed Specialty dog show here, well, in Canby OR, this Friday. I can't wait!! Jack, is too little to go ~ he's just turned 3 months. (He weighs in at 25lbs today! That's my little future champ!!)

       urlLink    This is a picture of the K1C2 scarf I'm knitting. It's in a kit "Monaco" ~ the scarf is fabulous!! The colors are incredibly rich!! The pattern is the same as their Pattern 1000, the self-fringing shawl pattern. It's gonna look so great when the fringe is unravelled!&nbsp; urlLink

      I had my interview yesterday, it went fabulous! Hooray!! I think I'll be able to start my new job next month. I'm just praying the sale of my store really does go through. The lady is excited, but, really nervous  This next weekend is a Samoyed Special not far from our house ~ I'm really excited! Next year our puppies will be able to show in it. They can actually start showing in Sept. Jack is an awesome looking dog - well, most of the time!! lol! As you can see he found a whole new spot to dig this morning... It's one of his very favorite things to do!  I just started knitting the "Morroco" scarf from K1C2. The colors are a gorgeous rust and harvest gold/black blend. I love it! It's done witht the same pattern as the Tartelette shawl - one of my fav's! I also just finished a stripey hat from Manos del Uruguay and samoyed. I'll take a pic later and get it up. I absolutely *love* knitting with SAMMY!

      I'm a 38 yr old (perhaps I'll go with 30something...)wife, mom, shepherd and yarn shop owner. And in my free time. . . YIKES!  Anyway, I'm selling my yarn shop soon - infact I have a job interview this morning, hence, the "anxious" feeling! It's gonna be fine, I'm looking forward to my next venture!  I have two kids, my daughter is 18 & my son is soon to be 17. My daughter just graduated from high school and my son will graduate early next year. I've been married for almost 20yrs and my husband is my best friend!  Well.... More later, I'm off to get ready for my job interview! Hooray!! Wish me Luck!!
