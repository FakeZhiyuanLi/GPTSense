       I have been watching two remarkable events at the Olympics today. The first is the USA v. Puerto Rico in men's basketball. We absolutely got spanked by Puerto Rico. The game is noteworthy because 1) our team--the overwhelming favorite to win gold--has not played well, and 2) Puerto Rico--a team not even expected to contend for a medal--has played brilliantly. Which leads me to the second event, the men's soccer match between Costa Rica and Iraq. Iraq, a team whose nation has been and still is at war, who has no home field, who had to get outside money just to function, not only qualified for the Olympics, they beat Portugal--a finalist in the recent European championships--in their opening match. That was a HUGE upset. They won by two goals, a big margin in soccer, and one of the goals for Portugal the Iraqis accidentally kicked into their own goal. I missed that match, but now am getting to witness them play. The score is 0-0. If the Iraqis win, they move on to the next round. A tie still keeps them in contention to move on. It is amazing. The energy and joy with which the Iraqis are playing is inspirational. Regardless of how anyone feels about the war and what is happening in Iraq now, I fail to see how anyone could do anything but cheer for these athletes.

       The next item on the list of dissenting views concerns chemical weapons.  Let’s start by examining some of what  urlLink the public version of the NIE  said about Iraq’s chemical weapons.

       The Bush administration claimed publicly that Iraq posed a threat because of its ability to deliver chemical and biological weapons via unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. In  urlLink a speech on October 7, 2002 , President Bush said “We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States.” Then he said the following in  urlLink a speech on February 6, 2003 : “Iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the Security Council. A UAV launched from a vessel off the American coast could reach hundreds of miles inland.” In his  urlLink February 5, 2003, presentation to the United Nations , Colin Powell spoke of Iraq’s success in converting an aircraft known as the L-29 to a UAV and Iraq’s efforts in developing smaller UAVs with shorter wingspans and “spray devices” for dispensing chemical and biological weapons. Powell’s ominous message included the following: “According to Iraq's December 7th declaration, its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of Iraq's newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on autopilot...The linkages over the past ten years between Iraq's UAV program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us. Iraq could use these small UAVs...to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or, if transported, to other countries, including the United States.”

             In the  urlLink “Franks on the absence of WMD”  post, I took issue with General Franks’s view that every indication before the war was that Iraq had weaponized WMD, and I listed numerous reports and opinions that raised objections and contrary views. I will discuss each of those, and I am going to start with a general examination of the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, or NIE. This was the primary document upon which the Bush administration based its case that Saddam had WMD and had to be taken out via military force. The  urlLink Senate Intelligence Committee’s Report  basically trashed the NIE, saying that “Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community's October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction, either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting.” Even so, the NIE shows that it contained numerous caveats, qualifiers, and dissenting opinions.

       I am going to post some thoughts on the various "dissenting" intelligence reports I mentioned in my previous post, but before doing so, I want say something positive about General Franks, lest anyone think that I want to do nothing but bash him. In  urlLink the  Parade  interview , Franks responded to criticism about the force being too small by saying that "having a smaller force gave the U.S. an element of surprise," and that he believes that the speed with which that smaller force got to and took over Baghdad prevented 1) damage to the oil fields and water supply and 2) missile attacks on U.S. forces. I think he is probably right about that. However, that does not address the post-end-of-major-combat-operations phase of the war (that is, the occupation and reconstruction phase). While I consider the job that Franks did in planning and executing the war itself to be superb--especially in light of the denial of a northern front through Turkey and the adjustments that were made during combat--the planning for the occupation and reconstruction--to the extent there was any--was an abysmal failure. In the August 9 issue of  Time , Franks is the recepient of the weekly "10 Questions."  urlLink The third question  starts out with "In your book, you absolve yourself, President Bush, and Secretary Donald Rumsfeld of inadequate postwar planning." Well, I agree that Franks is not responsible for the "inadequate" postwar planning. That was not his job. However, as I will explain in a later post, the ultimate responsibility for that planning lies with the National Command Authorities, of which there are two: George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.

         Franks said in the Epilogue of his book that his greatest surprise was “The absence of weaponized WMD in Iraq.”  In  urlLink  Parade  , he insisted that “Every sign...from Arab leaders to intelligence estimates, had indicated that Saddam had them.” Again, this is something one would expect the Bush administration to jump on. Here is a certified war hero, a tough, no bullshit Army General, saying everything indicated that Saddam had WMD. Surely that provides a justification for going to war.

       From Franks’s book, it is clear that he does not like Richard Clarke.  In both  urlLink the  Parade   interview and his book, Franks says “I never received a single page of actionable intelligence from Richard Clarke.” My guess is that the Republicans will be repeating this on a regular basis since Clarke has been the most outspoken and most inside of the Bush administration’s critics regarding terrorism.

       General Tommy Franks has been in the news lately. Last Thursday (July 29),  urlLink CNN published an article  that was basically a preview of an interview published Sunday in  urlLink  Parade  magazine . The  New York Times  published  urlLink an article on August 1  about his book (which went on sale August 3), and on August 2 Franks was  urlLink interviewed by ABC’s Ted Koppel . I have read portions of Franks’s book,  American Soldier , and they say pretty much the same thing the articles and interviews do. I am quite sure Bush and his supporters are going to try to use some of Franks’s statements to their advantage. However, they had better be careful, for Franks also said some things that will not help Bush.  This will be the first post in a series about what Franks has said. Before getting into the first topic, I want to say that as a military commander, I have much admiration and respect for General Franks, and I agree with him on some issues. However, there are other issues on which we disagree. With that in mind, here is the first topic:    Franks was told by Egypt and Jordan that Iraq had WMD.    Bush and war supporters just might point to is Franks’s claim that in January 2003 King Abdullah of Jordan and President Mubarak of Egypt told him that Iraq had chemical and biological WMD. The  Times  article says that Abdullah cited "reliable intelligence sources," while Mubarak cited conversations between Egyptian officials and Saddam. In the  Parade  interview, Franks said that Mubarak told him that "Saddam has WMD–biologicals, actually–and he will use them on your troops," and within an hour Franks passed that information to Washington.  On August 2, the Associated Press issued a report entitled  urlLink "Egypt Denies Telling U.S. of Iraqi WMD."  As reported by the AP, Egyptian presidential spokesman Magad Abdel Fattah said that Franks’s claim "is void of truth." He went on to explain that "What happened was that Franks asked the president for an assessment of reports on Iraq's possession of WMDs, and the president simply said that Egypt had been following the developments in Iraq, but it could not confirm whether Iraq possessed any weapons of mass destruction or whether these could be used against U.S. forces in case of U.S. military interference in Iraq." A similar denial came from a Jordanian Royal Palace official: "His Majesty did not have information that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction."  Koppel asked Franks about these denials, and here’s what Franks had to say: "Uh-huh. Not, not, not surprising, Ted. I think one sort of has to be aware of the way, the way politics works in the Middle East, and so I'm not at all surprised by that. I'll simply stay with what I said." At this point I’ll take General Franks at his word. I see no reason not to. However, this raises at least two questions.  The first is "Why would Egypt and Jordan now deny making these statements to Franks?" Perhaps Abdullah and Mubarak 1) do not want to look like they were fooled as badly as the U.S. and Britain were on the WMD issue, and 2) do not want the rest of the Arab world to think that they encouraged the U.S. to invade Iraq. Other than these possibilities, I don’t have an answer. That is just as well, for the second question is more intriguing to me.  If Abdullah and Mubarak did make these statement to Franks, why is the Bush administration not shouting this from the rooftops? Why are we hearing about this only now? Why was there no mention of this in the Senate Intelligence Committee Report? I did various word searches on the entire Report and found nothing about these statements. Franks says he passed this information to Washington. It is hard to conceive that the Senate Intelligence Committee knew nothing about this. It is likewise difficult to conceive that the White House did not receive this information and has not previously disclosed it.  As with the first question, I have no definitive answers, but I do have some informed guesses. The first is that raising this issue could cause problems for a big potential arms sale to Jordan. When Franks was in Jordan in January 2003, the  urlLink AP  and  urlLink Reuters  reported that King Abdullah told Franks that Jordan intended to buy an defense system, and the top general in the Jordanian army told Franks that Jordan wanted an American system. The Reuters article also noted that "Jordanian officials have said in recent weeks they are looking to buy an anti-missile system from Russia or Europe," and the AP article said that "Jordan negotiated with Russia last year to acquire the S-300 surface-to-air missile system. Russia had initially suggested that the system would be installed in February at the latest, but recently said delivery was not possible before the end of the year, forcing the kingdom to shop around in Europe. Government officials have said Jordan reached advanced talks with European suppliers, mainly German and Dutch, but that financial terms had not been finalized." So, we have a country wanting to buy a major weapons system from the U.S. while at the same time shopping for other major weapons systems from other countries. Fast forward to August 2, when the AP publishes a story describing how the State Department "defended a prospective deal to equip Jordan with high-tech air-to-air missiles[.]" So Guess # 1 is that the Bush administration has yet to say anything about Abdullah telling Franks about Iraqi WMD because disclosing that could potentially negatively affect a big arms sale.  There is more to this potential arms sale to Jordan, and it leads to Guess # 2. The reason the State Department is defending the possible sale is that Israel is trying to block the sale, according to both  urlLink Reuters  and the  urlLink AP . Reuters reported that "Israeli security chiefs fear [the] sale to Amman could encourage Egypt to make similar arms deals with Washington, tipping the strategic balance in the Middle East." Thus, in addition to lots of money being at stake for a U.S. defense contractor (which likely has close ties to Bush), this potential arms deal is caught up in Israeli politics and the Middle East peace conundrum. At the very least, that makes the deal a very tricky matter in diplomatic terms. Consequently, a retired General doing anything which could make an already dicey situation even more complicated could be unwelcomed. If the Bush administration were to say anything about Franks’s claims, that could really screw things up. Poor W...caught between making money for one of his defense contractor buddies and upsetting Israel. Either way he goes he runs the risk of losing political support in an election year.  And there is yet another political side to this. Jordan is a moderate (as in non-extremist) Arab nation that is a key player in keeping the peace in the Middle East. It has been at peace with Israel since 1996, when the countries signed a peace treaty. Jordan is a country with which the U.S. has good relations–as in an Arab country which is not openly hostile or a threat to us. As such, Jordan can play a key role in maintaining whatever credibility we have left in the Arab world and rebuilding that credibility. In other words, it would be a bad idea to piss off King Abdullah. It would be a bad idea to embarrass him in any way. So here’s Guess # 3: the Bush administration has said nothing about Franks’s claims because that could strain our relations with Jordan (as could the proposed arms sale).  The bottom line is that the Bush administration appears to risk problems no matter what it says about Franks’s claims, so better to just say nothing at all.
