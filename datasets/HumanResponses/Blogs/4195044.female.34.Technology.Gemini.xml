             Fotos in the past..... in Paris 2002     Been busy copying some of my scanned pics into the new laptop. (The laptop is doing GREAT *so far* by the way, no more of those scary symptoms!  Uiteindelijk !) Ohh, that reminds me too, to ask Dutchman a favor to scan our other holiday fotos...      Anyways, I got so hyped up seeing our Paris trip 2 years ago, Dutchman's gift to me for visiting him in NL. I knew we will be staying there for a week... but when I asked him how much my share was for the trip, he grinned and said, "  Its my gift to you baby!  ". I guess that was kind of romantic at that time since I didn't get any flowers!!! You know Dutch-MEN, they fall behind the romance department but this was indeed plus points! Doncha agree?          Crimee Metro Station          A candid shot! Didn't expect Dutchman will flash away!   I love the bright yellow color of the underground channel, kind of warm but sexy.         Cafe in Montmartre          Located on the same hill where Sacre Coeur church is sitting. Dutchman and I were kind of arguing if we would like to have a foto in this cafe. I insisted, hehe. So when we got the bill, we asked the waiter to do it!   I think he did a fantastic job!           Eiffel Tower in the Evening!        See the lighted Tower on top of my head. The lights go blinking for several minutes every hour. Beautiful, it looks like an inverted Christmas tree at night! Haha! Best place to view it from afar would be in Montparnasse building.         At the  Train Cabin restaurant.        That place was actually charming but heck, it was too small, even for me!        Sacre Coeur        Stairs going down to the street from the church... w/   Paris view in the background. Can you imagine going up and down with my heels!? March weather wasn't that great too, hence my umbrella!            Montmartre Square  with the Painters.    I tell you, the painters in this square should be sent to court for harrassment! They behave in fact like glorified beggars begging to paint or make a sketch of you for a fee. I had to hide behind Dutchman's butt! ---But, I couldn't pass the opportunity not posing in the square with these talented species and their art as my backdrop!

        The Gothic Cathedral     The history of Utrecht began where the church stands today. At the beginning of our era, the Romans built a fort here, the remains of which still lie under the Domsquare today. The first Saint Martin’s church was built on this location in the 7th century.    From Roman to Gothic  The predecessor of the current church dates fromthe start of the 11th century. Some remnants of this Roman Saint Martin’s cathedral can be seen in the garden beside the Domtower. In 1253, a huge fire swept through the city and badly damaged the Roman cathedral. A new architectural style, Gothic, was chosen for rebuilding the church. Construction of this Gothic Saint Martin’s church began in 1254, when Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone. Bit by bit, the originally Roman cathedral was replaced.    urlLink      The DOM in Utrecht     1254  - Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone of the Gothic Cathedral.    1320  - Construction of the tower began.  1500  - Tower and church were connected.    1520  - Construction of the cathedral ended.    1 August 1674  - Utrecht was ravaged by a tornado. The cathedral nave collapsed.    1826  - The rubble was finally cleared away, the current Domsquare was created.    1901 to 1931  - The reception building in front of the cathedral tower was built.    2004  - The nave rises again!

       Saturday is shopping day at our favorite cheap-y grocery store,   urlLink Nettorama  . Dutchman calls it, “ The poor people’s supermarket ”. He’s eccentric; he is fond of altering defined subjects that he fancies on.  The   urlLink Consumentenbond   (Consumer organization) have rated them as the #1 supermarket with the cheapest prices in the whole of NL. The low-cost German   urlLink ALDI   and   urlLink LIDL   ranked next.  Its just 10 minutes bike ride from where we live, which makes it very convenient for us. I kind of liked it since it gives my legs the needed exercise for the weekend. I have a  fiets tas  (bike bag) that hangs at the back of my bike. Sister in law gave this to me, very useful when we go shopping.       WAIT...... did I just say we shop with our bikes?  WHY  the heck are you shocked? Hehe - I myself still can't get over the idea. It's kind of kiddy-stuff. Well that was how I see it before, I thought biking is akin to playing.... but not here in NL!         If you don't have a bike ,  then you don’t live in NL  . That simple! Later I will edit this entry and post a foto of a Dutch going shopping with this ubiquitous bike.      Studies here show that a Dutch person has on average 2 bikes.  The 1st bike is a “ beat down bike ”, for practical reasons against bike-napping, the country’s # 1 crime. These bikes are the ones you artfully evade when crossing the streets in the Centrum. The nice thing is... you actually hear the rickety subjects from a distance. They make their arrival known so that gives you ample time to jump to the gutter!  The 2nd bike, a “ nice good priced bike ”, for personal enjoyment… and must by all means never be detached from the owner. Alright I am exaggerating! If you choose to let’s say leave it somewhere, then do NOT, I repeat do NOT forget to padlock the poor thing twice, some in fact do it thrice! Talk about being SIGURISTA! And a reminder, you are stupid if you leave it in a non-paid  fietsen stallen  (bike parking)! Consider yourself warned.  Great, I have finished my bike rant and now I will go shopping :-)   HP/Microsoft Update : The Laptop is again working  OK  but in a recuperating mode. I simply am puzzled in limbo, why a "Brand New Laptop" is doing pantomime acts on me. Dutchman says it will just get worse. I trust his judgment, he is the Techie. I am already sold out to just re-install everything, start fresh, start new…. even if Dutchman is gnawed. Yes, he is totally over-harassed with this freaking machine, and it’s him who will do the dirty and tedious job of re-installation, not me. Oh well…  vervelend .

       Work is slow this month but I got 2 orders today from Fujitsu and Pacific Internet. The fat bitch is getting married later in the afternoon. She will be away for a month. Good riddance... at least for the time-being, hehe.    On to the OGRE...    I am seething in anger towards the ogre   urlLink Microsoft  ! My   urlLink HP   laptop is barely 2 weeks old and is already suffering from dementia -  Memory Dump . The processor can´t stop groaning forever, all because of the pathetic  Microsoft IE  eating up the system. I know it´s new, so it must have the bug crunch and even if you install the software patches... these updates by the way like a neverending cycle, produces new sets of bugs! Chicken and egg situation. I really don´t know what to do. Stayed up last night till 1:30AM fixing it, well Dutchman did it for me. Dutchman can´t even view the errors! We have done the  RESET  countless times, still it remains the same, unyielding. When he deleted the IE in the taskbar, the system quickly went back to normal. But what is a person without the soul? The hardware is nothing if there is no software!  Given the chance, I would kick Bill Gates´ass for monopolizing the desktop software consumer market. I hope tonight the laptop will do some miracles... if not, I am resigned to re-install that despicable  Microsoft XP Pro ! :-(

       Have you ever been to one?  Yesterday Dutchman and I went to a Dutch church wedding of his aunt. The couple is in their late 50’s and have lived together for quite some time… that when they announced the wedding, everyone in the family was surprised!  The Netherlands is… how I describe as “A  Matured Liberal  but  Socialist Country ”. Partnership relationships have become a trend in the 20th century offering the same semblance and privileges as any marriage bonded. In fact if you ask a Dutch if he/she would like to marry? The answer would be: ”  MARRY? Why?   * eyebrows raised *   That’s just expenses  ”! For a Dutch, there is plainly NO distinction between being married and living together.  We arrived at   St. Nikolas Kerk   (St. Nicholas Church) in   Jutphaas  ,   Nieuwegein   slightly before 2PM and a sizable crowd was already gathered outside. The usual 3 kisses went flying in the air and embarrassing enough, some I have no clue who I kissed! What to do? Dutchman has so many relatives!  The whole church wedding came as a  Seal  of  Revelation  to me.  There was NO wedding march song. NO red carpet in the isle. NO flowers. The beautiful antiquated church stood there void of any embellishment, of any hint of marital binding. The bride was dressed in an untraditional garb, NO wedding dress but a white pant suit! NO entourage and if I may explain that… that means literally as NO bridesmaids, NO groomsmen, NO maid of honor, NO ring bearer, NO flower girls. Yes NO flashy train following the couple around!  The groom was NOT waiting in the altar but instead the couple together with the priest went down the isle to the altar. Interesting huh?  The homily went on to focus of their past lives, both having met in a support group for having lost a loved one. One can only imagine from afar how  loss  can metamorphose into  gain . In their case, it did.  Cocktails followed in an English Pub in   Vreeswijk   – a striking town in the south of Nieuwegein full of these undersized charismatic draw-up Dutch bridges. Dutchman and I have been here in the past, bicycling through. I had white wine, peanuts and some sort of Italian biscuits with herbs and cheese. And that was it!  The dinner, which in other cultures is fondly called as  Reception  – this is actually your chance to feed your guests, was  helaas  only for a selected group. The bad news, we are not part of that group,  jammer  hahaha! The invited elite are only the direct family members, and since Dutchman is a nephew - 2nd generation, so is he disqualified. I would even bet my € 100 if there was a wedding cake that evening!  How is that for a Dutch wedding? Quite practical (!), isn’t it?! Yes, Dutch culture at it’s finest!

       " Mondays " they say is the least exciting day of the week, perhaps the angels above were napping because   hallelujiah   today is absolutely an exceptional Monday! My superior, the Sales Director gave me the go signal (approved by upper management) for our Philippines business trip!  So the next days, in fact the whole week, I will be religiously devoting my time in refining our trip agenda. I desperately need to concretize my ROI justifications - yup per client with at least a 6 month to 1 year forecasted plan on total sales and profit. Am pretty sure, like in most corporate reality drama - these   wolves   will run after you, in this case  ME . They will be behind my back at all times after having invested much (*eybrows raised*) just like a crazed wolf stealthily watching the sheep.... yes this will happen after the business trip!!!  The   wolves   want results, results, results. The sheep nods and say: "no problem, I give it to you baby!",  BUT  the main ticker here is... how polished are the sheeps support tools so this poor little sheep can produce foxy-enough results for these   werewolves  ?  Rhetorical question?  A  not-so  friendly reminder ---   A wolf can easily devour a sheep for lunch!     Uh-oh.... I don't think I would taste good for a lunch snack? Would I?

       What the heck is going on with this bloody Blogger? I couldn't get in for the freaking *nth time! And once I did, the whole window flew out of my keyboard?! I have typed in more than a million words and boom *&amp;^%$! in a snap it was gone.  Don't you just hate that!? GGGRRRRR... Jammer! Ugh.  I was supposed to be talking about that *big yawn* cliched household chores... and how I am sooo glad that my Dutchman isn't a Chauvinist Pig! Har har har!  Perhaps next time, I will extrapolate the matter. For now, we can dwell on the idea that Dutchman is a GOOD PICK! *wink*

       What has become of the world? What has become of me?   I am a bonafide internet junkie!   There is reason in fact to celebrate... if not because of this crazed technology, Dutchman and I wouldn't have crossed our paths! He would forever stay in the flatlands, maybe end up being a cheesehead ( kaaskop ) bachelor all his life, while I... will be in someone else's arms in God knows where land. Blech! Me thinking that gives me an icky feeling. I guess that is what real   "  LOVE"   can do, exorcize you! Haha!  Let's see... I have several  Forums  that I am a member of. A travel forum, a Fil-West forum (couple of them), Bisaya forum, Government forum, European Expat forum, Philippine forum, International forum.... what else? Oh yeah I forgot, the forever friendly networking   urlLink Friendster   and this addictive   urlLink Blogger  . To add, I have   urlLink YM   and still contemplating of installing   urlLink ICQ   in this new laptop. I still have   urlLink mIRC   but I rarely go there.  Albeit, having not degenerated myself into a full-blown Internet Consumer, I am by huge chance prepared to join the pack. Who knows when?  Je weet van nooit!  To consummate this pledge would be the day that I loose human adroitness in socializing, even if I have to only go to  urlLink  Albert Heijn  ,  urlLink  Nettorama   or  urlLink  ALDI  . I know they are poor choices of social forms but hey, that's as realistic as can be! SOBER...  Oh well, I book my tickets online too.  urlLink  KLM   has flying colors on my notes with  Online Booking  and  Kiosk Check-Ins...  but I have no freaking idea why they behave like PAL? -Plane Always late!- Duh, not  urlLink  Philippine Airlines  , boohoo! Teehee!  Then we got for sure the money and life savers - Online Banking in NL. Fantastic!  urlLink  ABN Amro   ( De bank ) does the trick.  urlLink  Spaarbeleg   quite so too... absolute convenience is all I can say.  What's next? .... ......... ..  Maybe nothing yet, hehe. I am still thinking. I think sandman caught me....

       Lovely. The place   DJANGO   was cozy, in Dutch it is suppose to mean  Gezellig . The food was superb! Typical European cuisine: measly scraps of lettuce and shrimp. I am sure the main course didn't reach my viscerals, anyhow I didn't bother raiding the fridge when I got home! I need the NEEDED diet. Nonetheless, my time with my friend Pat was marvelous.  We talked randomly. Her family holiday in Spain, mine in Greece.... her sister from Florida visited.... our work and the omniprescence of these assumably control-freak bitches, who can't seem to get a life outside their fantasy workplace.... our DutchMEN and I won't further comment because my Dutchman knows this site and he might hack it down! * Tremble *... our un-never-finished houses (her daughter called that the sink again dripped!)... and of course what we want as  wimin .  I think flying to  New York  with her is an exciting idea, in fact she would be the best person to travel with since she lived and worked there for more than half of her life's existence on this planet earth! She did want us to go visit  London  but helaas, I am not so feverish about it. Golly, I was just there 2 months ago, but next year would be a different scoop. I can just imagine: " Girl's Night Out ". To top it all, it's just an hour flight from Amsterdam ;-).  Maybe I will bring Dutchman to this DJANGO restaurant.

       A life saver! Mush-mush for the Cloggies in banning the decrepit Check System!  I just loved it really. No more checkbook balancing.... no more accidental paper trail... no more writing so-called money on paper. I am aversed to this kind of chore back in Manila. I am terrible with numbers and I must - if I must, use Excel to be able to add (and minus) things up. I wish I have a personal Accountant, har har har!!!  So, here's to Dutch ingenuity:  PIN  -  Pinnen  and  Online Banking  ( ChipKnip  too! but I never use this so we can forget about that hehe). Purchases are directly debited to your account. Even the sleaziest cafeteria in the dark alleys in Groningen up north has a Pin System. On the contrary, Credit Cards are not that popular - take note.  With Online Banking, you manage all your portfolio via the internet. It is very   SECURE  . Banks give you this " Identifer " code - a tiny calculator-like machine which is programmed to match a series of number codes together with your Pin. Brilliant really. These sober-looking Cloggies would probably give you their winning cheesy grin and say  Gaaf ! In reality, these Dutchies just want mundane things to be   SIMPLER ,  FAST ,  EFFICIENT ,  ORGANIZED   and   CHEAP  .  Nifty swifty, is how you can describe transacting all financial movements over the internet.  Muah!  Kusje  Dutch banks :-)

        Oh gawd, I am so dang tired. :-(      Last night I stayed up 'till 2:30AM checking jobs online. Found two. I revised my cover letter so I can induce some sparks and catch any attention worth catching! Boom, sent it. The next morning I got two responses. That was quick, really. I didn't match to their profile and requirements! What news - Life. Ack. Oh well, you win some, you lose all!       Work. I am still ZERO on the board.      Was nice to be back in the centrum of   Amsterdam  . Dutchman asked me to join dinner together with his business colleague from the UK, Matt er  Mister  Matt.   Leidseplein   was it... an intoxicating place. Beertje then Thai food. Uuummm nice for a change.... except that the waiting ladies took a long time to wait on us for the food to be served! Moreover, all I heard the whole evening was the ubiquitous and riotous word, " Mister ". Don't ask what it means because you'll never get it anyway. A niche in  Mister  Dutchman's world, kind of a secret boys club password.      And surprise surprise.... Pat called! It's been ages. We are getting together come Friday evening. Aaaahh friends...     bewitching.

        The  Foto  actually worked! Thanks Friendster for hosting it :-)      My tales for the day...       Ugh I am tired. I watched half of the " The Last Samurai " last night. It was freaking 2AM when I drift off to bed. Dutchman didn't even noticed me!    At Work....      I am close to snapping at this  Fat Bitch  in the office, who can't seem to handle a decent conversation, even with my boss, her boss. Why does she have to scream her tonsils out into her brains in order to get a point across? Talk about harrassment! Nothing is ever good enough with her ONLY IF you first consult her timeless wisdom and discernment. Perhaps she is seething with boiling animosity that we now get to report to the same person!      Then the new toy, my  HP Pavilion ze551ea  is doing ' Fijn '.       By the way, ' Kut weer ' is back - rainshowers and a 19C temperature, supposedly for a nice summer day today.... BUT yesterday was 31C?  Wat is er aan de hand?  What did the Dutch do to deserve this kind of earthly punishment?
