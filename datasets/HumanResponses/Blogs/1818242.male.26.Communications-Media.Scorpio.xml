      It's been a bit of a mini-whirlwind the past few days. Tuesday night, I played squash. There's this social squash thing on every Tuesday night. Anthony said 'for beginners'. If the people we saw playing that night were beginners, I'm foetal.  Anthony, Felicia, Deanna and I turned up. Initially, the coach paired us up. Then he split all of us, letting us try playing other people who were there. The coach (Gary) is quite good at assessing your proficiency. I got paired with Ashley, who made me run around the court like I never have before.  I was having so much fun, I didn't really notice that I had sprained my ankle until I was home.  Early next morning, met Adrian L in the city. We went to the Charles Dickens Pub along Collins St to watch Juve vs Man U. Damn, it was a great morning. Haven't felt like that after a United match for a long time. Guess I'm spoilt by their success.  Met Jason for lunch that afternoon. Also found out my old landlord is more devious than I thought. She's really evading taxes big time. Shall I blow the whistle? Well, I'll see how I feel after the weekend retreat for the committee. I didn't have much time to bother with her the rest of this week anyway.  Wednesday evening, watched the Melbourne Tigers vs Cairns Taipans. Basketball at the State Netball and Hockey Centre at Royal Park. It was quite entertaining, and the atmosphere was good for a small crowd.  Got pissed off at one of the Straits Times Forum page writers. Some "Beyond Condo Sub-committee" of the Remaking Singapore Thingy. Well, considering that I had other things to do, and that I had two letters rejected by ST already, I decided not to rant and rave this time.  Thursday: spent most of the day at Union Lawn promoting COSDU. "Promoting" = "Sitting down at the table waiting for people to approach". Went for dinner with a few of the COSDU people and had coffee at Lin'contro (how DO you spell that?). Of course, we spent as much time finding for a place to hang out as we did at the place itself. Ok, that's exaggerated, but we spend ages deciding where to eat and where to chill. Some things never change. :)  Had an interesting conversation about religion and faith with Michelle and Felicia.  Helped out at the COSDU table again this morning, the weather has been Jekyll & Hyde.  Anyway, to end off this entry, this is what I wrote to Felicia in response to something she wrote in her blog about the Pope:  ----------  Food for thought indeed but personally, I disagree.  Popes are very much human, and they do make mistakes. Infallibility aside it really doesn't take much digging to find corrupt or errorneous Popes.  If this happens again in the future, do we just blindly follow?  This is where faith comes in - Your personal relationship with God.  Faith is personal. Religion is the outward expression of your faith. The problems with most people is that they get caught up with all the rules and regulations.  That's what the Pharisees were doing in Jesus' time. They were caught up with the rules. And this is where, 'til this day, there is division among people: 'cos all of us have a different interpretation of the rules (and insist on highlighting differences).  Our insistence of the Pope's supreme authority is ironically ALSO a cause for divison.  So how?  I believe God is beyond petty divisions between different denominations of Christians and different religions too. We believe in the Church because our faith has lead us there. Each religion is a system of belief, not belief itself.  At the end of the day, everyone would be better off if they did practise the simple sayings in the respective texts of their religion. "Love thy enemy" - if only we could practice what we preach, both as individuals and as a Church.  ----------  No doubt there will be people who disagree with me.

      Just came back from a jog, and now settling down to planning a few things for COSDU. That should fill my afternoon. Will be playing squash in the evening.  Yesterday, went jogging in the morning with Brian and Lydia. Jogged at Lydia's pace, which was moderate, so I managed to go an extra round after she had completed six.  Went to school to sign up for tutes. Didn't manage to sign up for all the tutes. One of the modules, the tutes will be settled during the first lecture. Asking for trouble... The other module, I had to sign up at the department office, and I made the mistake of going during lunch time.  Watched 'The Hours' at Nova. ($5 on Monday before 4pm :) Well, I didn't really connect with the story, but the way it was told was excellent. Like the parallelism. 'Parallelism' - haven't used that word in a long time.  Spent the evening at home... as far as I can recall! Went to sleep relatively early.  Now... have to put my mind to preparing a couple of COSDU sessions.

      I was up at about 8am. Brian woke me up. Last night wasn't good. Manchester United played badly, and luckily managed to salvage a draw. Arguably, the sign of true champions. But the Arse fans would probably disagree.  Left the house at 11am, and went to South Yarra for the BBQ. The turnout was a lot better than expected. Despite people pulling out, we still had more people turning up than what was on our list.  Another good thing - the weather was excellent. It was supposed to be rainy today, but there was nothing but sunshine! I did hear "Walking on Sunshine" in the morning, though I'm sure that had nothing to do with it. =P The food was excellent, the company was even better! I dearly wish the new people felt at ease and enjoyed themselves too.  Dinner: Brian, Justin and I finished leftovers from the BBQ. I ate more than I did during the BBQ itself. Amazing.  - Visions of oily chicken wings and sausages -  Made a few phone calls during Optus time, and made an overseas call too.  All in all, a great day.

      I've been holding back from blogging for quite some time now. Why the change? I don't know. Perhaps I feel that I need to have an outlet. I don't nearly write as much as I should. (I don't nearly READ as much as I should either, come to think of it.)  What I know is that it might be a good way to let friends know what's going on in my life. Might, because: 1. I'm probably not going to write every itsy-bitsy nitty-gritty detail here; 2. I want to keep some things private anyway; and 3. I'm assuming my friends out there will log on to read my ramblings.  Well, I've been reading lots of my friends blogs, and they seem to have really insightful entertaining stuff in them. That's probably a bit of what got me to start this. Anyway...  It's a Saturday afternoon here in Melbourne. I'm not in any particular mood today. I've been saying that I want semester to begin soon. I think it'll hit me before I realise anything. Have been busy preparing for the COSDU 'barbie' (BBQ in ozSpeak) tomorrow. Next week is going to be a flurry of activity as orientation takes place. I'll be at a retreat for the COSDU committee over the weekend, then semester begins on March 3.  Blink, and I'll miss it.

      Feeling a lot better now. :)  Things are going to get busy very very soon. I really have to start seeing to my essays. The first of which will be due on 4 April. One on 7 April, and two on 16 April (a day before Holy Thursday). Should choose my essay topics, and start researching.  Yesterday was my first rowing lesson. Another semester, another short course. We didn't go into the water 'cos there were a lot of preliminaries to cover. It promises to be great fun!

      Last Sunday, I spent quite some time on the phone with her. I told her something that she didn't want to hear, but something that would have come sooner or later. We went through our whole "why we can/can't/should/shouldn't be together thing" one last time. Time to stop being pseudo girlfriend and boyfriend, she decided.  Can't treat her special any more. She said she'd call when she feels ready. And that we'd call less often. Her computer has been down, so that means I haven't chatted online with her for some time. I don't know if she's gotten her computer back 'cos I haven't heard from here since we last talked on the phone on Sunday.  Why all this? Because I fancy someone here in Melbourne. Someone who's name I shall not mention because she's the second part of my tumultous 'lack-of-love' life. I've been out with her alone as a friend a couple of times. And on a semi-aborted date (was planning to go somewhere but the weather was threatening, so we ended up at her place - so was it still a date?). She's also been to my place for dinner (two Tuesdays ago)... and from then on, things have gone downhill for some reason or other.  I have no idea why. She readily agreed to go out on that date with me. (And for once in my life, I actually said "Go out on a date with me" as opposed to "Go out with me" - which to some people is all the difference between dating and going out as friends.) Then before I knew it, the weather changed.  Anyway, it's been next to impossible to get to talk to her in person, or even on the phone or online. There's this awkward silence every once in a while. And whatever I want to say, or want to find out from her, I want to do it face-to-face.  To help things, I've been ill. Tuesday evening, I felt the cold and sore throat coming. I dread that, 'cos I know what's going to happen. Surprisingly on Wednesday, the cold wasn't as bad as I expected, but it was a cold nonetheless. I shouldn't have played tennis at noon under the hot sun.  Thursday. Still had a cold and a slight sore throat. Went to the loo in the morning, and suspected I was going to have diarrheoa. Was already having a headache in the morning, and feeling feverish. Went for classes nonetheless. After dinner, I went to the toilet five times.  Friday. The cold and sore throat had more or less disappeared. After taking medication for diarrhoea the night before, I went to the loo in the morning. And I haven't been back since. Spent the day combating my headache. Decided I couldn't do the session. Asked Sister Theresa to take over. She got Felicia to bring me some crackers. When Felicia hugged me, she said I was definitely having a fever. And when she hugged me before leaving, my fever had subsided somewhat. I was really thankful for her visit. Made up for the disappointment of not being able to play squash. Oh, and she made porridge for me too!  Anyway, for the first time in a long time, I was home on a Friday night in Melbourne. That was a truly strange feeling.  I couldn't stand the headache anymore, so I took a couple of Panadol tablets before I slept. I'd been avoiding that 'cos I have an occasional reaction to it. Results in swelling under my bottom eyelids.  Saturday morning. No fever, no headache, no swelling, no diarrhea. Still felt week from all the water I've lost over the past few days. Decided to go support the COSDU Games Day.  Ended up taking part. Obviously, I wasn't able to take part fully, I was goalie for both captain's ball and street soccer. Still, I looked more or less fine. Apparently, Sister Theresa - the Chaplain - might have overstated my condition on Friday night, so there were quite a number of raised eyebrows. Well, I was dehydrated and not 100%.  In the evening, there was dinner at my place. Brian, Michelle, Lydia, Alison, Sue Lyn, Justin and I. It was supposed to be an experiment for COSDU's food stall at the upcoming Night Market. We had loads of pie.  Oh, and Bacardi Breezers and ice cream. (No, not together.)  This morning, I find myself not as good as when I woke up on Saturday morning.  Reminder to self: Fully recover before doing anything in the future.

      Not a good week at all. Been down with a cold and sore throat the past couple of days. Throw in a massive, pounding headache PLUS diarrhea (four times today and counting...) - I really feel like shit.  Which is what my excrement looks nothing like at the moment.

      Forgot to mention "what's missing" in my earlier post.  Missing music: The moomba fireworks on Saturday night weren't as spectacular this year. Last year, they were set to music. This year, it was just plain fireworks. Impressive, but no "ooomph".  Missing company: Didn't have friends to be in the rain and wind with before the race, share the excitement of the race, and share the joy after the race.  Missing somebody: Someone - generically or specifically (or perhaps both), i shall not say - is missing from my life.

      A whirlwind of a weekend. Friday was COSDU's Welcome Mass and Dinner. There were lots of new people, so I can't say that I even got to know the names of everyone. COSDU is burgeoning, and we have to deal with that in one way or another. It's not a complaint, it's a blessing to have so many new faces.  Saturday... a disappointing day at Albert Park. Coulthard didn't do so well. Raikkonen had a minor off which put him in 15th on the grid... or something like that. Ferrari, as usual, at the front.  Sunday. Was so tempted not to go to Albert Park. But I did, braving the rain and wind for about three hours before the race began. Once again, due to circumstances beyond my control, I attended the race alone. It was pretty depressing, standing alone in the pouring rain. I also had other reasons to feel a bit miserable.  Anyway, the race turned out to be fantastic. The first signs weren't too good, the two scarlet cars pulling away from the field. Well, this is what I remember (not in chronological order):  Raikkonen holding off a Schumacher attempt at overtaking. Brilliant!  Then he gets called in for a stop-go penalty for exceeding the speed limit in the pit lane. Damn!  Montoya losing control, giving Coulthard the race lead.  Small parts of Schumacher's car coming off.  Barrichello going off. (Thought it was Schuey at first; poor Ruebens always gets the bad luck.)  Two Safety Car periods, which changed the complexion of the race.  Some cars starting on intermediate tyres, some on slicks. A decision that resulted in a few unscheduled pit stops as the weather cleared soon after the start.  Heidfeld's Sauber going off in front of where I was standing.  Being so deliriously happy that McLaren won and Ferrari only managed fourth that I decided to take a photo with one of the AMD grid girls. :p  Went for mass after the race. Walked along a crowded but subdued Lygon, had a Choco-something or other at New Zealand Ice Cream (I'm sure it's called something else). Yvonne was working, so I got an extra dose of ice cream in the drink. Then chatted with Michelle at her place for a bit.  Then the Sunday night call to Singapore. Which might be the last one for some time.  Woke up this morning not feeling particularly fantastic. Sports, Entertainment n Media lecture was boring, but the tute was great - animated, intelligent discussion. If only we have the reading packs! Still don't have the reading packs for SEM and Intercultural Comms...  Australian Foreign Relations was a new experience. After one year of Postcolonial discourse, it took a bit of getting used this tute. The people were different, the content was different... I'm trying hard to integrate what I've learnt over the past year - critiques of the disciplinary study of politics - into the class. This truly is the flip side of the coin.  Now back home. Should really get to reading. Should really finalise Friday's COSDU session.

      Let's see: ankle still hurting from the squash game I played last Tuesday. I tried to jog today, but only managed four rounds before it became too painful.  The weekend was spent at the COSDU committee's retreat. It was really wonderful, uplifting and refreshing. I just wish Lydia and Mariska could have been there with us. The retreat was a wonderful way to refocus ourselves on our roles, and also to get to know each other better.  The school week: It's been mostly introductory lectures. With the COSDU table open on Monday and Tuesday, it was hard for me to register that semester had begun. Went tutes start. Perhaps that's when it'll sink in.  Doesn't help that the subject readers aren't out for two of my four subjects. What am I doing this semester? - Australian Foreign Relations - Cybersociety - Intercultural Communication in the Global Era - Sports, Entertainment and the Media  For some strange reason, I've been feeling really tired over the past two days. Tuesday was bad, and Wednesday was even worse. I kept on yawning during Ash Wednesday mass in the afternoon, then when I got home, I hit the sack, and I didn't manage to get up in time for welcome mass music practice.  Haven't had much chance to chat with Wynnie; her computer is still down.  Personal life not going so well. Think I'm going to run into another brick wall.

       Just came home from dinner after exam mass earlier in the evening.  Lots of questions are going around as to whether or not I am attached - of course I am... do I appear disjointed to you? - and if I am, to who(m)? (Never could figure out the right usage of 'who' and 'whom'.)  Anyway, bumped into my mass comm classmate, PC, along Lygon Street and she saw me with my arm around CY from COSDU. *gasp* The 'news' is going to be a bushfire...  KT is wondering whether CY and I are and item. (He once thought SSL and I were together.)  And JK is still wondering whether I am with JJ.  Wonder who I am going to be linked with next...  Wonder, wonder, wonder, what a wonderful world...

       Felicia has been telling me to get an easyjournal. I've caved in.  Why?  Well, this isn't my first attempt at having an online journal. The truth is, I've never been one to write my thoughts down on a regular basis. I should. But I don't.  With the previous journal, I was always wondering - Hmmm... who's reading this? What are they going to think?  I tried writing for a while, and I stopped before the pre-Easter essays (almost) overwhelmed me. Not many people knew about that journal anyway. Kind of defeats the purpose of an online journal, doesn't it?  I'm STILL wondering how much I should write in the journal. It's carthatic, isn't it? (Writing, lah...)  Ironic: another load of essays face me as I write my first journal entry here.  Back to the question - Why?  Felicia knows one of my good old friends from church and from SJI. In fact, Lester was my best friend for quite some time. Felicia's journal linked to his, and I read his most recent entries.  I don't have lots of links to my altar server and secondary school days. But those times were the best of my life. Hardly any photos, hardly any letters... and worse of all, hardly any contact with friends from back then.  Thank goodness for songs.

       Haven't been updating in a while. Let's see, I missed the Grampians trip. Instead, I managed to watch England do the world a favour by comprehensively beating Australia in rugby.  Also met up with Damian and Penny a few times.  Last nite, I went to the airport to send Penny off. That was quite an adventure. Penny was quite slow packing. We took a wrong turn on the highway. We bypassed the long queue to check in. Penny escaped excess baggage 'cos she's "a student returning home for holidays"... heheh.  Listening the the ultra-Beng/retro Ministry of Sound [The Annual IV] mixed by Boy George right now. Got the CD from Damian. Will definitely use it for the Great Ocean Road trip this weekend. Hahah... my passengers, you have been warned.  Oh, I got a suit! Navy blue, quite nice I have to say. :) Will pick it up on Friday 'cos they had to do some alterations.  I attended my first piano recital today. Christine played pieces by Mozart, Rachmaninoff and Bartok. Really really good! The Mozart piece was amazingly fast. Her fingers were flying all over the keys. The Rachmanioff piece I liked best. Really powerful at certain points. :) The Bartok one, she played well. But I didn't really connect with it.  Sent Christine and Jason to the airport just now. Hope they have a safe flight.  Tomolo: COSDU BBQ.

       Decision made: going to Grampians. Damian said 'no go' on the rugby match. I'm assuming he means we can't get tickets.  Yesterday was supposed to be a full study day but I managed to spend quite a lot of time pondering about the rugby/grampians dilemma. Also did some planning for Ee-Wei's upcoming trip here - booked a car and accommodation for the few days we will be at Great Ocean Road. Sounds simple but I took quite some time doing it.  Realism. Liberalism. Conservatism. Good. I still remember some of what I did manage to 'study' yesterday. Studying... I've come to realise how foreign a concept that is to me. I honestly don't know what I'm meant to prove in the exam. That I can regurgitate some 'facts' that I read? That I can memorise things and argue from/against that? I will find out tomolo. Seeing as to how I always say time pressure is necessary, I will get plenty tomorrow: three essays in two hours.  Met Penny for dinner. Had mushroom & chicken pizza with penne marinara for dinner at Papa Gino's. Then dessert at Brunetti's. Mmmmm... apple strudel yummy... Headed back to my place and continued chatting 'til just past eleven. Was really good to catch up with her.  Looking forward to Damian's two trips here. He's quite stressed out. Penny and Ingrid will keep him company (or is it the other way around) while I'm at Grampians. Hmmmm... should I leave him alone with two beautiful women?? Still, will get to meet him on Thursday and Monday. And he'll be around again in July.  Almost 9 a.m. Going to have breakfast, get the newspaper, STUDY the whole day, go for the Grampians trip briefing in the evening.  Read Lester's blog earlier. The first time I read it, he hadn't updated for a while. So, I've not gone back to read it for some time. He's been quite productive recently. Came across one of his entries with an icq conversation btn him and Felicia.  Hmmm... Felicia still hasn't called me 'Pin'. She must have forgotten. Or we haven't met recently. Everyone's still in their burrows, head bowed in books. Well, like Lester wrote, people used to call me Pinto. That's probably 'cos there were a proliferation of Kenneths - strange seeing my name in plural - in school and in church. And only he calls me Pin. Don't seem to recall Sylvester or Adrian calling me that.  Just as he finds it strange that I know Alison and Felicia (Ally and Felish to him... notice the contraction of names?), likewise, I find it strange too. Lester and I know each other in one context, and we both know Alison and Felicia in two entirely separate situations. What would a conversation be like between the four of us? Hmmm...  Oh, he remembers my confirmation name... now on public record in his blog. I know someone who's possibly reading this wants to find out my confirmation name. Well, go to lesman's easyjournal from the journal network and scan through his entries... :p

       Once again, I face a decision: Go to Grampians as originally planned? Or... Stay in Melbourne and watch Australia v England on Saturday?  Now that I have kaki to watch, and there are still tickets available... (Thank goodness Melburnians have no idea how to appreciate Rugby Union.)  Why go to Grampians? 1. Get away from the city 2. Take photos of beautiful scenery 3. Exercise 4. As a recce trip for when I go to Grampians with friends 5. Staying to watch the match (and just being in the city) will burn a hole in my pocket. Need the cash for other things  Then again... I will still have to spend money to contribute for petrol, to pay for food, to buy film and pay for developing & printing. Also, I'm not THAT desperate to get out of the city.  Why stay to watch Rugby? 1. England just might beat Australia 2. I get to spend time with Damian and Penny & those who are going home for hols 3. I can party with friends on Thursday night without worrying about waking up late on Friday morning 4. Squash on Friday! 5. No need to rush things before and after the Grampians trip  Then again... I'll be in a foul mood if England loses. I'll be watching two Rugby World Cup matches later this year anyway.

      Played squash on Saturday with Brian, Denning, Felicia, Florence and Jason. Deanna was there too, but I didn't get a chance to have a game with her.  Our little squash group has grown. Su Li usually joins us. Bryant and Christine want to start learning too.  Brian's game improved dramatically from the previous day's marathon session with me. Jason's game seems to have plateaued, but I'm sure he can get to a point when he can beat me consistently. Denning's powerful and quick, and that poses a problem when I play against him. For some strange reason, our games seem to be closer than when he plays Jason. Felicia has improved tremendously over time. Florence... hahaha... Don't get me wrong, she can hold her own on court. But she's damn funny. Watching her play or playing against her. Sure to laugh!  I thoroughly enjoyed my game with Jason. There was a point at 4-0 in one of the games. We were running every inch of the court. Left me out of breath, and that let him back into the game.  I remember being down 0-6 to Denning almost at the end of the day. He lost serve, and proceeded to lose the next nine points. I won't say it was my best game, but I wasn't expecting to come back like that.  We spent nearly three hours playing. When I got home, I realised that it would be my last squash session with some of these people for a while.

       Felicia asked a few interesting questions. I don't claim to speak for the church, but these are my views.  Did our faith brainwash us?  If it did, what does that change? Love one another... love our enemies... Not the way of the world, but good (and brilliant) advice nonetheless, right? Too bad we don't seem to heed it a lot of the time. Maybe we haven't been SUFFICIENTLY brainwashed.   Why do you we believe in what we believe in?  Faith. (As opposed to religion.) Pure blind faith. Do you believe that's air you're breathing? ;)   Why do we think all that we do is correct?  Ah, personally, I don't think we are correct. Or to be more accurate, I don't think others are wrong. The simplest way I can put this is that I believe God came to save us ALL. One reason why there is so much strife in the world is because we choose to play this "I'm right, and you are wrong" game. When we play that game, it means most of the world is condemned.  Of course, I'm not sure how someone of a different religion would answer this question.   If we believe that what we believe in is right, can we (I) say that we have been brainwashed into thinking that it was right?  A combination of my faith and life experiences has led me to the conclusion above. Brainwashed? Nah.   Are we any less brainwashed than the people who belong in what we brand as 'cults'?  Back to the first response. What's the goal? How has the 'brainwashing' changed our lives? Or has it changed our lives at all? I dunno. 'Brainwashing' is such a dubious term... I'm not an expert of cults but I'm sure that their means of leading you to believe and the contents of their belief are duplicitous.

       Brian and I went to Myer, and we bought an electric clipper. It was really cheap. I think it'll pay for itself after about two and a half haircuts. Or shaves, to be exact.  Played squash for about an hour and a half. After that, I became Brian's barber. (The previous sentence was constructed after much thought - the other ways of putting this just seemed too rife with innuendo.)  It was actually quite... fun! Now I want to practice. Who knows, maybe I was supposed to be a barber or hairdresser... hahaha!  Any takers?

       Yesterday, I went out. Not to hand in essays. Not to pick up the newspaper. (Although, I did do that.) Not to do groceries.  I followed Florence to the city. She opened a bank account at HSBC. I bought a replacement tube for my... err... water pouch? Drinking bladder? And then, I finally found that elusive drink. The drink that has been taunting me. The advertisement on the trams calling out, "You can't find me!" The empty bottle I saw lying around along Faraday Street.  I found the Carlton Cold Shot. It's beer + vodka. 6%. MMmmmmm...  Let's see. I dropped of my goodies at home, then went to Lygon to get movie tickets. Bumped into Adrian. Got the newspapers. Ran into a girl who passed me, smiled and said 'Hi'. Who is this person? Not from M&C, not from COSDU, not from anywhere I can remember. Must have been mistaken identity. Bump into Adrian again.*  Met Deanna at Nova and watched the Pianist. Powerful stuff. Only one thing, the movie did meander just before the more crucial scene. Pondering even more, I think that the whole movie could have been a short film. Nevertheless, it was worth the money.  Whiled time away in the evening before going for a briefing concerning this photogallery. Which does not have a place yet. Ironic. It's called the homeless gallery. They truly are homeless right now.  http://vic.aipp.com.au/homelessgallery/  Had a good chat on the phone when I got home, and was feeling hungry and sleepy the whole nite. I finally succumbed to my bed at about midnite.  *Reminder to self: Bump into Adrian one more time - go buy Tattslotto...

       My last essay is due tomorrow. Last weekend was good, albeit unproductive. Right now, I've just got to push a bit to get myself over the line...  (Having just watched England beat the Maoris in rugby, you'll have to forgive the sports imagery.)  Try!

       We celebrated Michelle's birthday last night. She was absolutely terrified.  One would think that that's a strange reaction to having your birthday celebrated, but then how would you react to a whole gaggle of friends invading your house and your room to the tune of 'Happy Birthday'?  You'd scream with fear for your life, right?  ;P  ----------  Michelle, Christine, Brian and I took a taxi home from Crown. The taxi driver, a chatty fellow 32 years young, told us that it's nice to have a close group of friends - like the four of us in the taxi (and unbeknownst to him, the rest of COSDU) - to be with.  He said he envied us.  Is that what happens when you work? You lose all your friends?  I hope that where ever our taxi driver is, he's trying to rekindle old ties...

      It's so good to have almost all of COSDU back from their holidays. There's a frenetic energy that marked our mini-reunions. That being said, we've begun our usual pattern of 'stations'. Sr. Theresa heard about our indecisive inertia when hanging out groups of larger than four. She's christened this phenonmenon: Stations (start, stop, wait, start, stop, wait).  Thursday night we popped by each others places, and there was always someone new to welcome back at each house. Even Sue Lyn called and she said hi to people other than the ones she called.  Friday, I finally got around to doing what I've been meaning to do for some time. Then met a few COSDUans for dinner. It was strange sitting right in the middle. I wasn't exactly part of the main conversation between Keith, Cornelia, Brian, Sabrina and Sean. Yet I wasn't really part of the conversation on the other side either. I seemed almost a world away from Christine and Shu'an who were seated at the other end of the table. They had a profound discussion about literature. On the other end of the table, Sabrina was taking in all the bawdiness that comes with being around Keith.  Saturday, I was in bed most of the morning. I was feeling lethargic that day for some reason. Can't put my finger on it. I told Brian and he said he was feeling lethargic too. Perhaps it was the impending semester. I helped out in the kitchen, preparing dinner for the committee retreat. My spirits lifted when half the committee turned up to help us carry the food to Chaplaincy.  While they were around, the Australia-NZ Bledisloe Cup match was about to start. We watched the national anthems and the Haka. For the first time in a while, I could feel my hair standing on end during the Haka. A good sign. :) This time I felt the challenge being shoved in the Wallabies faces. The look on Waugh said it all - he looked... scared. The match ended 21-50 in the All Blacks' favour.  I didn't really get to watch the match. It was 8-8 when we came back from Chaplaincy. Michelle and Shanti joined us for dinner.  Sunday. Mass at St Carthages, then the confirmation (I almost typed 'wedding') rehearsal. Jason, my 'Godson', was made cross-bearer! :) Edna and Samantha are the candle-bearers and Sean will bear the chrism. Most of the confirmants are kids! Some couldn't be a year over 10. I had to run through with the newly-invested altar servers what they should do on the day. Brought back memories. :)  Had lunch with the committee, then conducted my games and session for them. Never knew watching the 'make the square' game could be so... errr... entertaining. :) Everyone's blindfolded, given a length of rope and the object of the game is to make a perfect square from the length of rope. The committee did it in 15 minutes. Well done! And they got themselves in a serious tangle at one point. They worked well together to get themselves out of that jam.  The next game, we played what I termed "The Tower of Babel". Okay, I didn't know what else to call it. The comm split into two teams and they had to build the highest possible free-standing structure to support a bucket filled with 3 litres of water. Group 1 were very calm and decisive. Their basic structure was built quite fast. Group 2 were more haphazard and seemed to be having a lot more fun. They were constantly laughing! They managed to finish their structure before the allocated time ran out. Even though they were one person short, their structure was the taller of the two AND it held up under the strain of the weight.  One thing I noticed - perhaps I'm wrong - the current committee has put a premium on trusting one another. I observed that both groups used this word quite a bit. Well, that's wonderful. :)  Was really sleepy after the session.  -----------  The left brain-right brain thing. Christine, Damian, Ee-Wei, Florence and Shu'an did the test with varied results. Some were spot on, others not so.

       How true is this?!? I honestly think it only covers part of my character. Alamak, seeing things as part of a whole. ;P I always thought of myself as more of a visual person. "Most comfortable with routine" - something I've always known and perhaps why I try to remind myself to seize the day. Oh well, just for fun... :)  Your Brain Usage Profile Auditory : 60% Visual : 40% Left : 77% Right : 22%  Kenneth, your results indicate a strong left-hemisphere dominance with a mild preference for auditory processing. This blend would suggest that you are an extremely efficient person, logical perhaps to an extreme. You tend to structure your life and learning in very precise ways.  You benefit from experience, seek the rational in situations and feel most comfortable with routine.  You are a detail person. You see each piece of a puzzle or situation with equal clarity and value, and thrive on your ability to fit each piece into a unifying structure.  Your learning style tends toward the auditory, which suggests that you process inputs sequentially and classify each before moving on to the next. You do, however, possess sufficient visualization skills and interest to supplement the auditory tendency and render you more active than a person who is purely auditory.  In all likelihood you will be somewhat reserved in appreciating your own talents and understate your abilities even to yourself. You will organize your time and set schedules for yourself and, in that sense, lose sight of spontaneity and other needs - both of yourself and others. Your enviable organization, structure, and efficiency make you a valuable asset to a team effort.   urlLink Left hemisphere or right hemisphere?

      This winter break has been a whirlwind. If I think hard enough, I can remember strolling briskly out of the Royal Exhibition Building exactly at the point when they stop you from leaving the building.  Kenneth Pinto has left the building.  What happened from then on end is just a flurry of activities. Now I'm sitting in front of my computer facing the reality of having four more days of break before my final semester here at Melbourne University.  Final Semester.  Time - there's just never enough of it. Let's take a look at things I wanted to do over the break but never got around to:  1. Taking black & white photos and experimenting with slide film. 2. Cleaning the COSDU store. 3. Reading the four (now it's five) books by my bedside. 4. Uploading photos to my photoisland site. 5. Jogging. 6. Other miscellaneous smaller stuff that's not worth mentioning but that I wanted to do anyway.  On the other hand, I did get to go places I've wanted to go. I managed to meet up with those who remained in Melbourne for the break and got to know some people better. Lots of friends visited. :)  People and Places  Damian It's always good to have him around. Damian was in Melbourne on three separate occasions. He's changed over the years, but all people do. He's still my best friend after all these years. I think his time here has done him a world of good. Reading his blog, I realise once again how lucky I am to be in COSDU, to be surrounded by caring, loving people.  Gerry She visited and gave us impetus to go places and to do things. I enjoyed her company and was really glad she extended her stay. Gerry may only have been around for one semester in Melbourne Uni, but her impact lingers on. In fact, during her short time on holiday here, I'm sure she's touched the lives of the new COSDUans she's met.  Ee-wei Ee - she finally came to visit. Well, I know she had fun here! I enjoyed myself bringing her, Lydia and Flo to Great Ocean Road (yes, the wonderful music in the car played a part) and bringing them and others to footy. Dinner at Lydia's was terrific too. I know she's in Singapore now, dreaming of foreign lands...  Ruth Ruth, Ruth, Ruth... met her twice since she came. I can't say that I've been constantly in touch with her since leaving Ngee Ann. Meeting her is always amusing to say the least. And I always have her to thank for introducing me to someone wonderful in my life.  Florence "Yah, why?" In her own way, she leaves a lasting impression on everyone she meets. Damian and Gerry are glad to have gotten to know her. Everyone is! She's also very "thweet" (i.e. sweet). I've lost count of the number of times she's given Brian and I stuff to eat. She's also bought us beer a couple of times. She's always willing to lend a hand when we need help for anything. She's always willing to listen to those who need someone to talk to. I could go on, but better not inflate her ego too much :p But I will say this: The holidays would have been different without her around.  Shu'an She makes really good muffins! :) Just an aside: Speaking of all the food I've been getting, I want to reiterate how lucky I am to be in COSDU - I'm always being fed! Shu'an is intelligent. Her writing is damn cheem, damn deep. (I can picture her disagreeing with me as she reads this. Shu'an, don't sell yourself short.) There are plenty of different kinds of intelligences, and we can't all be good in every area. I think she knows where her talent lies.  Keith What can I say but I think he's grown in terms of his thinking. There're lots of issues we disagree about but he's slowly learning not to be entirely dismissive. He's a challenging person to get to know.  Pugg Mahones Went there on Sunday night with Florence, Michelle, Brian and Keith. Keith kept on insisting on going out. Well, I agreed this time around. I think I've decline too many times. Also, the holidays were ending, my wallet had been replenished, and there were no classes to wake up for the next morning. No more excuses. I had a great time there. Brian and I were drinking quite a bit. I think we both had two Kilkenny's and five or six Bourbon Cokes. I also had a tequila shot. The music was excellent. Exactly my kind of thing, in the type of atmosphere I like. Reminded me of Damian, Trees and my regular Saturday nights at Victoria Bar in Hotel Intercontinental. Except the music wasn't jazzy. Won't forget that night anytime soon.  Mornington Peninsula Great Ocean Road Jr. It was an intermittently overcast Wednesday that Damian, Gerry, Maria and I went to Mornington Peninsula. It was a scenic drive. I didn't sleep throughout the entire journey. I think it was a combination of the conversation and the music in the car. I always enjoy road trips with Damian, whether it's just the two of us or with other people. Gerry and Damian had a long running 'do you know so-and-so?' on our way back from Mornington. Had a picnic lunch of sort at Arthurs Seat. There's just something to be said about driving, walking and scenery. I just wish I had a bit more walking that day.  My house Brian and I spent two days cleaning the house in anticipation of a house inspection. They took a quick glance and left. Nevermind, I actually ENJOYED cleaning the house. Never seen it so clean before.  Chadstone Funny how you've never been to a place, then suddenly you go there twice in a span of a few days. Chadstone, or Chaddy, is this huge shopping complex. I don't know what it is, but I think I'm not used to shopping in shopping complexes any more. It actually felt... weird. The stores lining Swanston, Bourke and Elizabeth Streets have become the norm for me. Well, I know I'll be used to Orchard and Scotts Road again when I return home. Then again, I've always said that I don't enjoy the crowds in the Capital of Singapore.  Dragon Boat Inn We bade Sue Lyn farewell over steamboat dinner at Dragon Boat, coffee at some Greek place which overcharged us and Pictionary and Twister at Joanne's place. My Compact Flash card in my digicam exhibited the first signs of going kaput.  Grampians | Telstra Dome | Victoria Ranges Climbing Centre | Great Ocean Road | Yarra River I've wrote about these in my previous entries, but they were part of my holiday. I feel I should mention them together with the more recent activities and outings I've had. I enjoyed the walking and driving at Grampians tremendously. Footy at Telstra Dome was historic - we were part of a record AFl crowd, and Collingwood won the second of its current four-game winning streak. C'mon beat Carlon and Geelong over the next two weekends, and it'll set up a cracker of a match against Brisbane on (Singapore's) National Day. Rock-climbing was also enjoyable. Great Ocean Road is ALWAYS an experience. Will never get sick of it, and I always find new detours to take anyway. The COSDU BBQ at the Yarra turned out to be a great start to the holidays.  Even though I didn't have a trip like Central Australia last winter break, I reckon this break has been just as fun, just as memorable.  Last night, watched Terminator 3 with Brian and Florence. I enjoyed it. Not too over the top, not overly reliant on CG, not too long. Brian couldn't stand it. Bumped into Jennifer Kusuma as well as Deanna, Tricia and Anthony after the movie.  Tonight, Maria Lydia, Diana, Su Li and Adrian return from Perth. Jason should be back tomolo. Christine will arrive from Brisbane tomolo afternoon. I think most of COSDU should be back in Melbourne by the weekend.  Phew. To think that there's going to be so much happening from now 'til December 27th - the day I bid farewell to this place. This place with all the wonderful people I know.  Thank you, God.

       :)  I've been having a great time.  Saturday, I went rockclimbing with a whole bunch of people. We were at the rockclimbing place for three hours. Probably as much as my muscles were willing to take. I climbed until my fingers were too weak to even grasp the itty bitty wall thingys lightly.  Footy! *directed at Florence* (apologies to the AFL for copyright infringement :p ) Good old Collingwood forever We know how to play the game Side by side we stick together To uphold the Magpies name Hear the barrackers a-shouting As all barrackers should Oh, the premiership's a cakewalk For the good old COLLINGWOOD!!!  North Melbourne 50 Collingwood 126  Nice to predict that they would win before the match and be so absolutely right. Went with another bunch of people, including COSDU people, Gerry and Ee-wei who were visiting from Singapore and friends of friends. I think 13 people in all.  Sunday was a quiet day, but it was still good. Grace called and we went for evening mass at St Carthages together.  Monday - Grampians! An early start. Met Gerry, Su Li and Adrian in the city together with Brian and took a bus to Sunshine. Got the car and sped off to Halls Gap. Settled our accommodation - there were kangaroos just outside! - and then went on a whole afternoon walk: the Wonderland Loop.  It started off a little cold, then everyone began to take off their jackets. Just as we stopped for lunch, it began to rain, and out came the jackets again. The Pinnacle was covered in fog, but it was still amazing. We got back to our cabin, showered and had a hearty meal. All of us were so tired, we just slept without planning the next day's walks.  Tuesday. Set off at 10am after checking out. Went to Mount Zero for a short walk. 'Short' is, of course, relative to the previous day's walk. We did Mackenzie Falls before heading to Mount William to watch the sunset. 1.8km to the top. One of the longest 1.8km of my life. Managed to get some nice shots even though the cloud cover was quite thick as the sun went down. We stopped at Halls Gap for a quick bite and a dash of petrol for the car. Got back home by 10pm - that was about a three hour drive. The drive was challenging - it was dark and foggy.  Yesterday got up late, then went to Chadstone - for the first time - with Florence and her kawan. Met Sue Lyn and other COSDUans for her farewell dinner. Unfortunately, there was some screw up with my digicam, and we lost quite a number of good photos. Had coffee at a Greek place after dinner at the steamboat place along Russell St. Then played Pictionary at Joanne's place.  Will be going bowling at Chadstone tomorrow. (Funny how you've never been to a place after being in Melbourne for one and a half years, and suddenly you go there twice in the space of three days.) Dinner, then Charlie's Angels 2.  Might watch Collingwood again on Saturday... :)  Oh. Did I mention that I've been down with a cold and sore throat since Monday? Not that it's impeded my enjoyment...

      It's the holidays! But I've been amazingly busy. Yesterday was the first morning I slept in. I was supposed to go for a bushwalk but I was too tired. The previous day, Gerry and Florence said I really looked tired. Well, I was!  Since the exams ended, I've been to the airport a few times, to see people off and to welcome them to Melbourne. I've been to Great Ocean Road for the fifth time. I don't think I'll ever get sick of that drive. I've played squash quite a bit too. Have also been planning a trip to Grampians, which will be on Monday and Tuesday. This weekend, rockclimbing and footy.  The rest of the holidays are filled with activity too. Damian will be back in Melbourne. Ruth is also visiting again. And I've got to prepare things for the COSDU committee retreat, scheduled for the weekend before semester begins. Have confirmation rehearsal that weekend too.  Semester begins. *shudder* Just one semester to go. Time really...  Quite short of cash. Also have to start thinking about what to get for all the August birthdays. So many!!

      Just watched United - yes, there is only  one  United - lose to Southampton. Damn. (Cue poking from all the ABUs.) That has left me incensed and very much awake. Just as well, I have an assignment to do.  It's  urlLink Finals  month for the AFL.    urlLink Collingwood v Brisbane    has been scheduled for   urlLink Saturday 6th September 7.30 p.m.   at the  urlLink MCG . Anyone interested? Once this footy season is over, that's it for me... the next time I watch anything live is the  urlLink Rugby World Cup ... and the next time after that, it's  urlLink Bishan Stadium  (capacity:  urlLink 3,000 ). Also, I've never watched a night game at the MCG. So, yes, I'm really keen on going. Concession prices: Standard $29; Prime $32; Premium $35. Those tix go on sale to the public on Wednesday at 9 a.m. (Actually, by the time the AFL, MCC and Club members buy the tickets on Monday and Tuesday, there will only be Standard tickets left. If any...) Anyone else as crazy as I am?  To all the teachers I know,  Happy Teachers' Day . =) You're touching lives every day, and we remember...

      She slipped in the toilet, hit her head and died. It sounds tragicomic but let me assure you, it's not.  That's how my Primary Five and Six form teacher passed away.  This morning, Mum smsed me: "Is Joyce Choo's maiden name Tan Wan Keng?" I gulped. Why would she want to know her maiden name?   Unless...  No, couldn't be. She's still young, in her early 40s or so. She had battled cancer, and won. We - 6B (a.m. session) 1989 - knew her as "Miss Tan". She was one of a new breed of teachers. We had dedicated teachers before, but she was more than that.  I replied that I didn't know her chinese name but we did know her as Miss Joyce Tan. She'd married a few years after we left primary school. Calling her Mrs Choo always seemed weird.  Primary school classmates. How to contact them? How to confirm it was her? There were about 40 of us. A disparate bunch to say the least. A few of us ended up in Saint Joseph's. I only kept in occassional touch with one of them - Edwin Kheng. I swear I had his mobile number on my phone.  Apparently not. Not in my Palm. Not in the ICQ info. We're supposedly living in the connected age. I sent off an email and ICQ msg in the hope he'd reply.  Mum said the photo in the obituary looked like her. Still, I wanted to be absolutely sure. I wanted one of my classmates to confirm it.  Until then, I was in denial - something I've seemingly become quite adept at doing recently. Can't be. Absolutely cannot be.  I went to Uni, smiled my smile, talked my talk and hid the disbelief, the denial and the pain.   -----------   Saint Anthony's Boys was a small school. Sub-standard by Ministry of Education declaration. Things never seemed to change. The same teachers were there year after year. You always knew who'd be taking over your class the following year. There were only two classes per level per session (or four per level total).  Miss Tan came into our lives much to our surprise. I can't recall specifics, but I think we knew very early on that she was different from every other teacher we had. She was attractive, young and full of energy. I'm quite sure more of my classmates had crushes on her than they'd dare admit.  She was big on writing. And not just compositions. I remember the term "creative writing" being introduced to us very early in the year. To a Singaporean primary school kid used to writing almost template-like essays, creative writing was a radical idea.  Write ANYTHING you want? Poetry? Prose? Dialogue? I remember my gems: poems on chicken wings (i had yet to discover drumlettes) and roti prata. She was always encouraging. Correcting grammar when necessary, and helping those who knew the rules to break grammatical convention.   Everything we wrote, she valued.  She also set up a letter box. Miss Tan told us to feel free to write anything we wanted to her. Once again, another radical idea. Writing to your teacher?!? We caught on, and ended up telling her more than we told our friends and our parents. I still have her replies, kept in a box at home.   Yes, she replied to every single letter.  I remember her advice on BGR. Advice I would take years to implement. Hormones were raging a bit early with me. But I was shy. (Still think I'm shy actually.) Really! I remember her putting me in my place, telling me not to smirk so much, that other teachers had noticed that I smirked... a lot. I was smart, but not that smart. I remember her giving me advice on leadership. I remember her words on my ambitions: don't be a lawyer, eventually, you'll have to lie as part of your job. Or at very least, not present the truth. Not in those words exactly but something along those lines.  I'm not a lawyer, nor training to be one.  She was principled, and she was unabashedly Christian. Miss Tan was clear on how God worked in her life, and she wasn't afraid to share her faith. She never once attacked the Catholics in class, nor any other religion. Her faith was truly amazing. And her faith would one day help her get through cancer, as some of us found out during a little reunion gathering some years later.  Her lessons were thoroughly innovative. I never recalled doing experiments for science until she came along. She made sure our library corner was well-stocked, and she introduced us to Roald Dahl.  We had class outings DURING semester. We'd always had pointless trips to places like the Botanical Gardens at the end of semester but never one that was used as part of the lesson plan. I remember the trip to the Fire Station. That was so... cool! And we did so many class activities based on that visit.  She got us to sit in groups based on ability. This may sound like a bad thing, but it gave her time to help the ones who needed help. The smarter ones helped themselves with minimal input from her. She challenged everyone to perform beyond their ability. We wanted to, for some reason or other. I guess it's because she valued our work. More importantly, Miss Tan valued each one of us. She was a master motivator.  Miss Tan also implemented fines. 10 cents for every time she heard someone speak in something other than English during her classes.  What do you know? Our class performed better overall. No need to mention the English language grades.  At the end of both years, she helped us produce a class magazine, which contained the best of our work, personal profiles and photos.  Despite all this effort, we angered and disappointed her. I remembered her storming out of class in tears a couple of times. Bad memories - I don't remember why she left the class, just that she did.  And now, she's left us for good.  I could go on but I still wouldn't do her justice; I still wouldn't be able to fully quantify or qualify her effect on our lives.   ----------   The day passed, and I came back home. No reply from Edwin. I smsed Mum to ask her to scan and email the obituary. She called me and confirmed that it was Miss Tan. My brother, who attended Asher (a tuition/day-care place she had started up), confirmed her demise.  Aunty Joyce, the staff said, had passed on. Mum told me how she died.   **********     Dear Miss Tan,   I know you're in heaven now. I wish I had kept in touch with you. Asher was literally across the street from home. I'm sure you're looking down at me, seeing my tears. I'm so sorry...  I hope that you're proud of who I've become. You are one of my biggest influences. Who and what I am today, is partly because of you. I am proud and honoured to have been your student. Thank you, Miss Tan. I love you.  Damn it, I'm crying in my room and I know you'll never be able to reply to this. I can't write any more.   Yours-in-Christ, Kenneth

      Okay, I'm not a chemical engineer. The ball was fun. Yesterday was hectic. Cooked for Festival of Nations. Lecture. Shouted, "Fried Rice! Chicken Curry! Five dollars only! Get it while it's hot!" Tutorial. Picked up photos. Helped chop vegetables for the following day's Festival of Nations stall. Did a few admin things at home. Showered. JW came over to collect her photos. Ironed shirit. Wore shirt. Florence arrived. Joy arrived. Michelle and David arrived. David drove us to the ball. Ball. David drove us home. Updating blog. Should go to sleep. Zzzzzz....

      I had a splitting headache during the graduation ceremony and during dinner. (Don't think the photos I took will turn out too well.)  At first, I wanted to take panadol but I remembered I had beer in the fridge. Now, most people would have taken the panadol and forgone the beer - apparently a hangover-inducing substance. Well, I figured, fight fire with fire. Someone is probably going, "You alcoholic..."  What do you know? The headache was gone by the time the United game began. (Both my teams won last night, but not particularly elated.)  The graduation ceremony was... boring. I was struggling to keep myself awake halfway through. It's different from the convocations in Singapore. The gowns are rented just for the day here. In fact, just for a few hours. So it's a big rush taking photos. The parents were all dressed up, and they looked proud. Everyone looked happy. As they should. In Singapore, you get the keep the gowns for a while, and take photos at your own time.  Under the gowns, you're free to wear what you like - individuality. I can't  remember exactly, but I seem to recall that all the girls and guys had to wear white, collared shirts in Singapore. And it's so strange 'cos the NUS/NTU graduation garb reveals much less than the Melbourne Uni garb - in Singapore, you can only see the collar. Okay, granted, the design of the gown makes it look quite strange if you wear something collarless. Still... You spend most of your Singaporean school life in a uniform, and at the end of the day, they still want you to be in uniform. (Who is 'they'? And have 'they' questioned why this rule is in place?) Singapore, for all its "be creative" rhetoric, shoots itself in the foot in simple ways. Simple things like this. And lets not even get into uniforms and tudungs/hijabs. I finally know what people mean when the complain that Singapore is stifling.  Suddenly have a vision of my graduation in Ngee Ann poly, when a certain someone wore a skirt with a super high slit. The guy next to me gasped a gasp of admiration/desire/shock. Errr... I digresss....  I've always claimed that Singapore isn't (stifling). Perhaps I was deluding myself. It is, I still believe, a matter of acclimatisation. Or conditioning, whatever you want to call it. Nevertheless, if Singapore wants to be a hotbed of R&D, an entrepreneurial society then we have got to let things go.   Funny, I wasn't planning to go into a treatise about individuality and creativity. It's probably a subconscious thing. Have to come to terms with leaving Melbourne, Australia. While that's on my mind, it's not foremost on my mind. What's foremost on my mind is not privy to this blog.  Now where was I? Lazy Sunday morning...

      The entire morning has passed without me doing any constructive work. Still part of that 'bleah' mood, I think. Saw this guy who looks like Keanu Reeves (in his Bill & Ted days) as I was walking to Safeway (nacho dip, cheese, cream puffs, newspapers).  It's grey outside. Not the ideal light for photography. Unfortunately graduation can't be rescheduled based on the whims of weather. I just hope that the photos I take for Michelle's friends turn out okay. I certainly wouldn't want  my   graduation photos to turn out badly.  At 7 p.m., I cheer for the Magpies. At 9 p.m., I jeer for the Magpies. Split personality? (Hmm... go watch 'Identity' if you want to think during a movie.) Nah... let me explain:  At 7 p.m., I  cheer for Collingwood. At 9 p.m. I cheer Manchester United as they play Newcastle (who wear black & white vertical stripes and are also called the Magpies... how's that for Anglo-Saxon originality?)  Hmmm... should be reading instead of mucking around with my blog.

      Harlowe everyone. If you're reading this, it means that I've decided to ditch easyjournal. Or that I'm still experimenting.  'Cos I'm not entirely happy with blog*spot. I'm still coming to terms with the interface and what not. Overall, I think there's more I can do with blog*spot though.  Once I can modify the blog as I please, then I'll be quite satisfied. As for now, please be content with the links to all my friends' blogs and a few links which say a bit about who I am and what I enjoy.  Please feel free to 'shout out'. =) Maybe you can tell me which one you like better.

       Ever had one of those weeks where nothing really good or nothing really bad happens? I'm having one of those 'bleah' weeks.  School wasn't so happening that I was particularly looking forward to any of my lessons. Neither was there anything that I was particularly dreading.  Not looking forward to anything this weekend, but not dreading it either. Not that there's a lack of activities. I'll be helping take photos for Michelle's friends' graduation. Brian's cooking dinner. I'll get to watch a bit of Sydney-Collingwood before I switch to watching the English Magpies (aka Newcastle) play United. (Recently, I've learnt that referring to Manchester United as 'Man U' is some sort of heresy. There is, after all, only one United. =) Have to get work done in the morning, then.  Sunday there's Deborah's BBQ. Might go for that 'Explorations - Directions' dialogue session in the evening.  Have not talked to Sr. Theresa for a while. Have not called people up to chat during Optus time in a while. Have not felt this flat for a long time.  Feeling very bleah.

       First of all, Happy Birthday Lydia! =)  Figured I have to celebrate Singapore's birthday too in this month of many birthdays - feel sooooo guilty after reading about all the loyal overseas Singaporeans who watched the National Day Parade Webcast.  And what was I doing? Watching Corring-wood v Blis-bane, then New Zea-rand v South Af-lica. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Sommore, I have bloadband intelnet. Where's my patliotism?  So, to celebrate belatedly here's the most recent SNE from BrownTown. Deliciously subversive but oh so true. Read, laugh and don't take offence. We all have to be 'educated' mah. =P Shamelessly copied and pasted, of course... (Eh, at least I followed Mr. Brown's instructions. Even 'bolded' his e-mail addy and website!)  P.S. In tute today, we discussed John Stuart Mill's On Liberty. Just thought I'd share a quote:  The State has a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may have been admissable in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom.  *open-mouthed gasp* Bets on whether LKY read JSM?  P.P.S. There goes my chance of being employed in the civil service.  ------------(Begin copied and pasted text)  Singapore National Education Part 87  by mr brown  Weeks of 17 June 2003 to 11 July 2003  (Feel free to distribute for non-profit and non-commercial purposes but keep my byline, email address and URL intact please. Thanks)    I have also learned lately:  1. That some people were very upset with the new Phua Chu Kang SARS Rap and music video, because they think it belittles the seriousness of SARS and death, and worse, teaches little childrens to sing in bad Engrish.  Maybe we should have gone all the way and got Nelly to do that song. You know, have writhing, big breasted women in bikinis dancing:  "Nelly: It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes; Girl: I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off."  2. That BG Yeo says "No" to five day work week for Civil Servants. But Civil Servants need not fret, they still have that one day in the year where they get to go home early (5 pm! A whole hour early once a year! How cool is that?) and have dinner with their family.  And they have all of Sunday and almost half of Saturday to Romance Singapore, Step Out Singapore, and Have More Sex to Make More Children Singapore.  3. That BG Yeo wants us to become the Seven-Eleven of Singapore. Open 24 hours everyday. Because the world economy does not sleep so neither should we.  That is exactly why our Public Transport system runs 24 hours. Oh, wait. It does not. But you late workers can always take taxis. They seem to show up a lot after midnight.  4. That Singaporeans living in the NE will be pleased to know that not only do they have the world's first driverless heavy rail system ("Singapore: We Must Always Be First"), they will be paying more than others for MRT rides, and they can expect "glitches" and other fun delays a few times a month because of the ultra sophisticated nature of this computer-driven MRT system.  It is a good thing we tested the system and kept putting off the opening, to test the system. It is because of this extensive testing you get to enjoy this almost glitch-free train system.  Oh, and residents of Buangkok, the train will not stop at your station because there is not enough of you living nearby. If you like, you are welcome to stand at the station platform and watch the trains whizz by. Oh wait, you can't. The station is locked and the entrances blocked.  Now wasn't all of the above worth all the wait and delays, dust and inconvenience?  5. That after the extensive learnings of the benefits of a driverless rail system as revealed by the LRT, we decided that we will do it again but this time, for a heavy rail system.  Why should the LRT have all the limelight?  6. That the next plan for the world's first driverless heavy rail line may well be the world's first passengerless trains. But we will need another 6 years, no wait, 7 years, no wait, 8 years, to test it to ensure that the trains will run without passengers.  The entire system will be run by computers. With the passengerless train system, passengers will not need to get on the trains to be transported to their destination. They just need to stand on the platform of their starting station, and the fully computer-run system will teleport them to the destination station, without them needing to step onto the trains at all.  But because of the complexity of the system, there will be some teething problems initially. Like your head appearing at Buangkok station, your liver appearing at Kovan station, and the rest of your body in various states of assembly, appearing at Potong Pasir station.  But that will only happen once every three weeks on average. So you needn't worry.  7. That as part of the Lowering of Expectations exercise done by SBS Transit for the new NorthEast line, in addition to announcing that there will be glitches and delays, and that the Buangkok station will remain closed to save money, the next few announcements may also include:  "You know that airconditioning feature we mentioned? Well, because of costs, we will be installing fans instead."  "Seats? What seats? If you can lean on a bum rest in an SBS bus, you can lean on a bum rest on an SBS train."  "Due to the complexity of the 500 computer systems running this line, sometimes, the trains may not stop at Hougang and Potong Pasir stations. We are still trying to find out why."  8. That my wife believes they should open the Buangkok station even though there is not enough demand at that estate at the moment. She believes that population growth follows the creation of an MRT station. Or in her own words, "Haven't the NE MRT guys ever played Simcity before?"  9. That there is actually a mechanical pencil from Uni "Aqua Touch". How do you borrow that from a friend?  "Can you let me have your Ah Quah Touch?"  10. That Mr TC Chow, Senior Director of projects and engineering of the LTA proclaims, "My computer hangs once every 2 weeks because I clicked on the mouse too fast. So you see, even the well proven Microsoft system have glitches."  So from this we understand that:  a. The computer is a good analogy for a public transport system. b. Based on this assumption, we can have pilotless passenger aircraft now if only we are willing to put up with some glitches, like plane crashes once every 2 months. c. That we must not click on our mouse too fast, or it will hang. d. That the Microsoft system is well proven. At doing what, it was not made clear.  11. That Singapore was rated one of the most unfriendly cities in the world.  To that, I say, "#$%^&@* you! You foreigner think you all so @#$%^&* polite, issit?"  That said, as the papers also stated, Malaysia also languishing with us at the bottom of the table. So we feel better already.  "Residents in Kuala Lumpur, New York, Singapore and Amsterdam are the least likely to help strangers in need, which made theirs the least friendly cities in a survey of 23 countries." -Reuters  12. That some people feel that SIA should not go into the budget airline business, but leave it to the entrepreneurs.  "SIA should leave budget airline to the entrepreneurs  By Andy Ho" -ST  There can only be one possible local candidate entreprenuerial enough for this... NTUC. NTUC Fairplanes would be a great idea.  If they can conquer supermarkets and provision shops, they can also conquer the friendly skies.  We have Comfort Taxis, now we can have Comfort Air. And the stewardesses can be Comfort Girls.  (The National Trades Union Congress, as the country's largest labour union, is an expert on the business of taxis, food courts, childcare, eldercare, pharmacies, supermarkets, driving schools, executive condominiums, insurance, and statistics, as well as death.)  13. That if SIA entered the budget airline business, it might have to do drastic things to ensure that costs are kept low.  Here are some ideas:  -Hire ugly air stewardesses -Install vending machines on aircraft -Screen movies with VCDs bought from JB (recent blockbusters shot in a cinema kind) -Remove half the seats and install bum rests for the Very Economy Class (hey, it works on public buses, why not budget airlines?) -Shorten the skirts of air stewardesses to save on material  I vote the last one.  14. That there was a "Miss Beautiful Legs 2003" competition held at Tiong Bahru Plaza recently. Prizes were slimming and spa vouchers.  But if you are Miss Beautiful Legs 2003, why would you need slimming and spa vouchers? They should give out these prizes to chicks with fat legs.  15. That you know it is time to buy a new mobile phone when all your un-tech-savvy friends have nice polyphonic ringtones on their mobiles and you have the dinky monophonic one on yours.  16. That Bill Gates also gets spam.  "Like almost everyone who uses e-mail, I receive a ton of spam every day. Much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick. It would be funny if it weren't so irritating." -Bill Gates in a WSJ.com editorial  Notice he does not complain about the offers to enlarge his penis or to get Viagra cheap.  17. That the SB 12, what could have been one of the toughest laws against spam, was killed in California. Leading the charge was not the powerful Penis Enlargement Lobby, or the Direct Marketing Association for Online Pornsites, but... Microsoft.  Spam is only evil if it does not come from them, I suppose.  18. That a score of Woodlands 0 - Home United 10 is not kelong. It is just sucky playing. Makes you wish you were a bookie right about now, doesn't it?  19. That OB Markers are not writing instruments you use to write on women's sanitary products.  20. That much as I love the music of Chinese boy group Tension (shut up about my music tastes, ok?), I will be returning their second album "Gotta Be Your Man" to the store, because it is a Copy-Protected CD a.k.a. Corrupted CD.  Not only did this Corrupted CD fail to play on my Mac, it also skipped and jumped on my Discman. On the 9th second of every track.  Until CD Manufacturers realise that Copy Protection only pisses legit customers off, their sales will continue to fall and die off.  Now if you will excuse me, I am going to try and get my $20 back.  21. That if they need your land, it is worth $1. If they do not need your land, and you overstay, it is worth $1 gazillion dollars!!!! Bwahahahahahahaha (play pinky at tip of mouth).  22. That according to a Straits Times report, "at home, the NEL which started running on June 20, has been generally well received by computers".  Hey, at least somebody is happy. But I wonder, did they ask the computers residing at Buangkok?  "NEL hailed by world body as model for public transport " -ST July 5 2003  23. That you can have a recovery but less jobs, because the old jobs are gone. So it is nobody's bladdy fault but your own, if you do not upgrade yourself and equip yourself with skills to do new jobs. The Government cannot be expected to create these lost jobs for you! Get real.  "Put in a nutshell, the PAP is highlighting one thing: Jobs. Creating them, safeguarding them, and multiplying them are what it is putting at the forefront of its campaign." - Chua Lee Hoong, ST, Oct 2001, article entitled "What's this General Election all about?"  "Citizenship doesn't entitle you to a job." - Chua Lee Hoong, ST, Jun 2003  'Lifelong employment is a thing of the past.' - MP and Labour Chief Lim Boon Heng, ST, Jul 4, 2003  24. That according to the ST, PM Goh says that the Govt is now more open to employing gays now "but homosexual acts are still an offence and some things gays want are a no-go".  So let me see if I get this right. You can be gay, but it is against the law to, um, do it?  I guess we can also forget about a Gay Civil Servants contingent at the next National Day Parade too, huh?  25. That "gay people who declared their sexual orientation would be hired in 'certain positions in government'."  It was not clear what positions were allowed.  26. That in Time magazine, it states that "The change in policy, inspired at least in part by the desire not to exclude talented foreigners who are gay, is being implemented without fanfare, Goh says, to avoid raising the hackles of more-conservative Singaporeans."  In AsiaOne, it states that "The change in policy was being implemented without fanfare to avoid raising the hackles of more conservative Singaporeans, he said in the latest issue of Time magazine"  Wah, want to be gay in Singapore also must be foreign talent.

       I have this pullover top which I think is grey. Apparently, it's PURPLE. Or lilac. There's a difference, I'm told. Some people may know that I'm partially colour blind. Well, here's the most glaring example of my medical 'condition'. It doesn't affect my ability to drive but I can't ever be a pilot. Worse, I have to think about all the 'grey' clothes that I have. Are they all PURPLE?  In other news:  My 100% 'home' record is gone. Collingwood was duly thrashed by Brisbane today. Grrrrrrr...  NZ won the Tri-Nations. I tried to stay awake watching a very (under) try-ing match.  Tomolo, the Charity... eh, Community Shield. Manchester United vs The Arses. Looking forward to watching the game with Adrian, Ming Yin and Joanne.  My schedule this semester seems really packed. Perhaps it's because most of my deadlines are evenly spread out. Also, I've got lots of things planned during semester - going to Sydney one weekend, going for the Chem Eng Ball, going to Grampians during the two week break, also expecting a friend to visit during the second week of the break, two or three Rugby World Cup matches...  Will I actually have time to study?

      One week of the 'mid'-semester break has gone by already. This week went by really fast! The general lack of sleep must have had something to do with it. Let's see...   Monday - Spent most of Monday finishing my Modern Political Thought essay... by far, the worst essay I've ever written. Was just so tired after the past couple of essays that I was not up to writing this one. Slightly underlength, no real depth.    Tuesday - Where did Tuesday go? Went to Vic Mart in the morning. I cooked vegetarian lasagne for the potluck at Joanne's. Not too shabby. Joanne made yummy broccoli with cheese, michelle 'made' roast chicken ;P , Sarah made a wonderful stew, Florence made shanghai noodles and an absolutely sinful chocolate cake thingy. Shanti, Justin, Brian, Lydia and Diana popped by. And Damian was over too. We ate loads, and we drank copious amounts of inebriating substances.   Wednesday - Went home in the morning. Had a briefing for the trip. I forgot what I did in the afternoon, but I was so tired after the week plus of essay writing and sleep deprivation that i fell asleep in the early evening. Next thing I knew, it was about 9 p.m.  Started packing and burning CDs for the trip. Slept at about 1 a.m.   Thursday & Friday - Hmmm... seeing as to how so many people have asked me to stop describing my days chronologically and focusing on how I  feel , I shall write about how I felt about the trip...  I felt  happy  that I was finally on the trip. There were quite a number of hitches, but yah, we finally managed to make it! The walks were really something for first-timers, so I'm  proud  that everyone made it despite the rain, the cold, the distance and the gradient.  Personally, it was a bit  tiring  having to organise the trip and drive in challenging conditions, but I was more than willing to do it, and I was deeply  satisfied that I did. Walking in the rain was strangely calming. The best part about that is always the aftermath - dry clothes, a bed, proper shelter, heating, warm FOOD... things we take for granted always seem a lot better after roughing it out a bit.  Thank you Maria, Joanne and Diana for driving. Especially Maria, for driving the Tarago most of the second day. Thank you everyone that came for the trip... it wouldn't have been as enjoyable without any one of you!   Saturday - Grand Final day. Not such a grand day for Collingwood. Nevermind, I still support them. Had dinner at the Bismi branch at Ong's with Lydia and Diana. Egg Prata... yuummmm! Then 60s music at Manchester Lane. Errr... we thought it would be jazz. Still, I think we had a good time there. Also had a good chat with Lydia and Diana about a myriad of stuff.  Today - Woke at at my usual time for Sundays: 12 noon. :p  Watched the Leceister-United repeat on Fox. At least one of my teams won yesterday. (Oh, and Kimi Raikonnen on pole position at the US Grand Prix.) Supposed to organise/scan/upload/burn my photos. But so lazy. It's holidays. I want a break. From everything. Think I shall go to bed...

      We had a talk on Creation Spirituality during Friday's COSDU session. I also had a shock - Damian was in Melbourne and surprised me by turning up at session... to think that I was not going to go for session!  Anyways, I connected with talk. I know some didn't. But that's part of the point, I think. We have to explore different forms of spirituality to find something that suits us. Some sessions concerning different forms of spirituality might not 'hit the spot', and something just might.  For me, there is something deeply spiritual about looking into the night sky at the stars. I think trying to understand - and it's hard, nearly impossible to imagine - the magnitude of the space and time between us and the (literally) heavenly bodies gives us a sense of God. For me there is something deeply spiritual about bushwalking, about being within nature - foilage surrounding, encompassing you. The silence and awe is prayer in itself.  I had a chat Sr. Theresa about the session and she said the Franciscan spirtuality concerning creation was slightly different from Sr. Anne Boyd's. Sr. Theresa shared that the Franciscan spirituality regarding creation is that everything is 'brother' and 'sister' to us.  Sr. Boyd's conception of creation spirituality is rooted very much in the wonder and awe in creation especially in understanding the harmony and unity of creation. The spirituality is about relationship, about how you connect with God.  So, even within a certain spirituality, there are different ways of approaching it.  The walk in the park was excellent. The Royal Botanic Gardens may be a man-made construct, but still everything in it is part of His creation. Enjoying each other's company is part of creation spirituality to me: after all, we are all God's creation. =)  I told Felicia - who's back home in Singapore - we should do it more often. She said then it wouldn't be special any more. I tend to disagree. There's always something special about creation...

      I had a good chat with Sr. Theresa today. It's been quite a while since I've done that, and I think it is no coincidence that I bumped into her crossing the street on Thursday - an event which led to our meeting today. It's also no coincidence that I spied a book lying on her desk during our conversation; Sister shared the following two psalms from this book,  Aotearoa Psalms  by Joy Cowley. Thank God for my fascination with all things New Zealand. (Okay, primarily the All Blacks... =P ) The psalms really spoke to me, so I share them with you too. Here they are:    48. Kenosis  (The relinquishment of the form of God by Jesus in becoming man and suffering death.)   Jesus, dear brother how well you knew the seasons in your life. God planted in flesh, you grew and flowered for thirty years for three years of seeding and that final emptying of yourself.  Jesus, I need your sense of timing. I am so keen to grow that I want all seasons at once, to flower, bear fruit, die to self, before self is fully grown.  I know that only the mature plant can come into fruiting and yet here I am, reaching out for tomorrow, ignoring the small plant which needs nurturing, which constantly cries out: "What about me?"  Gift me, Jesus, with the wisdom of those thirty years of growing and waiting and show me the importance of loving myself. I need to know that the hungry ego is not an enemy to be destroyed. It is a manisfestation of my need for growth.  I must draw life into myself and mature to the fullness God has planned for me. When my time is come, my ego will split wide open like the ripened seedpod it should be and empty itself for others.     50. Release    It was a bit like the opening of a tomb, really, the lids of the cage pulled back and quick bright life spilling out with an eagerness to fly. As I watched the wingbeat of those pigeons, I felt murmurings against the bars of my heart  All the love imprisoned within me fluttered for release. Blessings unspoken, smiles concealed, acts of kindness which had never got off the drawing board, clamoured for the light of day.  I wondered about the cost of opening the cage and letting love spread its wings. I felt a bit frightened. When I'd given everything away, could I live with an empty heart?  What I'd forgotten, of course, was the homing instinct of love, and how, unlike pigeons, love always returns with more than it takes away. The other thing I forgot was how love enlarges the heart to take its increase, multiplying and enlarging, multiplying and enlarging, until the little cage is as big as the Kingdom of Heaven.   Okay, Lydia and Diana have just arrived at my place, and I smell Brian's Chicken Curry from the kitchen... =)

      I had a full day on Saturday. It began with a trip to Bacchus Marsh, to visit the campsite for next year's Easter Camp. Now, you must be wondering, why did I go when I'm probably not going to be around next year? Well, I suppose I needed a short ride out of the city. Lydia asked me on Friday night, and I hadn't been clamouring to get out of the city. But come to think of it, the timing was perfect - despite the tonne of work I left in Melbourne.  The fresh air was good. Underbank Stud - the place where Easter Camp 2004 will be - is also good.  After that, Being There at Don Bosco. It was different from the last time around. Brother Vena wasn't there; instead there was Brother Brian (or Bryan, never did find out). More glaringly, the children seemed a bit more reluctant to play. There were some familiar faces, and that's a good thing. It means that they're not on the streets getting into mischief. I tried to be approachable. I guess I have to try harder. Well, will be back there in a few weeks, unless I get assigned to the soup kitchen. But hmm... I think continuity is part of the reason for this new format of the Being There (Social Justice) program - that is, going to one place throughout the semester rather than just once a semester.  Shanti was there with me, and we had a few games of pool. (Don Bosco is a youth centre, a safe place for kids to come play and hang out.) We decided to have dinner at Bismi since it was just a tram stop away from Don Bosco. Prata was good. =) Had a nice chat with Shanti too.  *disclaimer: please do not continue reading if you don't want to be bored / inundated with footy talk*  Straight after dinner, I headed on the 19 to Flinders St. Met Brian to take the tram to the MCG. The Collingwood supporters were already in good voice at the tram stop. There was a buzz in the air. There were Brisbane supporters among the Magpie Army but it was mainly a black and white mass. I bought the AFL Record, which I don't usually do. I figured it might be the last AFL match I watch live, so what the heck. It was drizzling a bit before we got into the stadium. Hopefully the weather would hold...  We walked to Gate 6, and I was glad that we were going to be in the sheltered section of the MCG. Section M3... hmmm... it suddenly hit me that we were sitting BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS. First thought that came to my mind: "This seems to have happened before." Second thought: "Won't be able to see the other side of the field." Third thought: "We'll get wet if it starts pouring." Fourth thought: "SHIT... we might be seating among the Brisbane Cheer Squad!!!!" Arrrrggghhhhhhh!!!!  Thankfully, as Brian and I took our seats, it was clear that it wasn't going to rain. The view wasn't all that bad either, and they had erected a temporary large screen on the opposite end where construction is still going on. So, we could still see the action at the other end. Anyway, it wasn't too bad, I could still make out what was happening on the opposite side. Also, I used Brian's binoculars once in a while. But it was best to watch without the binos 'cos you don't see where the players are coming from when the ball is in the air.  Most importantly, we were a relatively safe distance from the Brisbane Cheer Squad (and even further from the Collingwood Cheer Squad). Also, we were among a mixed crowd which was mainly Collingwood anyhow. After the match began, I was really happy to know that behind our seats, there was a bunch of die-hard Magpie fans who were every bit as vocal, if not more so, than the Collingwood Cheer Squad. They were in full voice throughout most of the game.  The club songs were sung (Good Old Collingwood Forever!), and so was Advance Australia Fair. Sometimes have to remind myself that it's not my national anthem. Anyway, the game began with a Nathan Buckley goal. =) Brisbane then scored and then got ahead. For a while, I was hoping that recent history did not repeat itself.  It didn't.   Brisbane were playing their usual game of quick and accurate passing, and Collingwood were getting caught out a bit. The Magpies were also slow in getting the ball out of defence and midfield. It really did seem for a while that there'd be another first quarter blowout.  The blowout never came. No eight goal barrage. Collingwood stuck with the Lions for most part and were only a goal down at quarter time. The second quarter silenced the Collingwood faithful a bit. At one point, Brisbane were three goals ahead. I was telling Brian that Collingwood needed to score at least one goal before half time, otherwise it'll be more difficult pyshologically to come back. Time was running out and Collingwood attack didn't seem to be clicking into gear. Still, they scored not one, but two goals. Half time and they were only a goal behind. At that point, I really felt like it would be Collingwood's day. The invisible pendulum had swung in Collingwood's favour. The momentum, the impetus were theirs.  I bought a beer and fries.  The Collingwood kids got thrashed by the Lions kids. Thankfully, that wasn't a reflection of the actual game.  The third quarter began. Collingwood was clearly taking hold of the game, without actually going ahead on the scoreboard. It was frustrating. Calls were going against the Magpies, and goals were becoming behinds. At the end of the third quarter, Collingwood were trailing Brisbane by only three points as a result of inaccurate kicking. The atmosphere was getting really tense. The cheer squads were upping their volume, and I was taken with the pandemonium, cheering like never before.  Crunch time. Fourth quarter. That elusive goal just never seemed to come. Instead more behinds. Three to be exact. All three should have been goals that would have put the Pies ahead. Instead, the scores were level. Brisbane pulled ahead by one behind. I was plain to see they were shellshocked. That behind would have been a goal in any other game. I think that's when they knew they weren't going to win.  We cheered - I cheered - for every good Mapgie move, every Magpie mark, every Magpie spoil. I was quite amazed at myself. I'm not this vocal. I guess that's the power of groups. When a mass of people are lumped together with a common cause, amazing things happen. We could feel something great was about to happen, and in some strange way, we were also willing it to happen just by power of lungs and voice. If Collingwood was going to score, it was because we were cheering like there was no tomorrow. At the same time, we were cheering like there was no tomorrow  because  Collingwood was going to score. It was inevitable.  And then, about 15 minutes into the penultimate quarter, it happened. A running move, and Alan Didak shaped to shoot... the ball sailed between the main uprights. Absolute pandemonium ensued. We all went berserk... ballistic. I jumped up screaming in delight, in defiance of the Lions. I shot my hand in the air, and shouted as loud as I could. I was so pumped that I was delirious. It was dizzying. It was like nothing I've ever felt before. Not even Manchester United's last gasp victory in 1999 at the Nou Camp against Bayern Munich. But I imagine it would have been like this if I was at the Nou Camp that historic night.  C-o-l-l-i-n-g-w-o-o-d! Collingwood! *clap clap clap* Collingwood! *clap clap clap* Collingwood! *clap clap clap* The unofficial cheer squad behind me got even louder, however possible that was. Before we could really settle down, Anthony Rocca took a mark about 25-30 metres from the goalposts with a slight angle. He faced my direction as he prepared to kick the goal. If it flew straight towards me, it would be a goal for sure. C'mon Rocca! He kicked... and the ball flew straight through the posts. It hung in the air, falling into the arms of fans a few rows in front of me. The guy who caught the ball turned around and cheered. We all joined in. I punched the air. Exhilaration. Brisbane were falling apart at last. They were visibly deflated. All they could do was get a few behinds. The Pies then tightened the noose. A goal from a difficult angle. The mad cheering continued all the way 'til the full time horn. Cue the Collingwood song!  I sang with all the gusto I could muster. My voice was already thoroughly hoarse from all the cheering and screaming. I was on a high from the moment Collingwood gained the lead, 'til the time I fell asleep. It was a game worthy of being a Grand Final.  Well, Collingwood will meet either Essendon or Port Adelaide in the Preliminary Final. If they win, then it's the Grand Final against Sydney, Adelaide or Brisbane. Should I leave it as it is? I'm short of cash and of time (have plenty of essays to do), so going to the Preliminary Final might not be a good idea. I began watching live footy with Collingwood beating Brisbane. Should I end it that way too? Hmmm... I guess I'll make that decision when the time comes.  This is not an understatement, last night was one of the most amazing experiences in my life.

      Someone once called this the "Grand Slam" of sacraments - having your baptism, confirmation and first holy communion in one day. It was a beautiful mass, one I'm sure Keith will remember for a long time. I was baptised when I was barely more than a month old at St. Joseph's Church (Victoria Street). I was confirmed when I was in Secondary Two at Church of the Risen Christ. Looking back, I do think that I was too young.  Fr. Peter Collins alluded (or implied - more neutral - or insinuated - more sinister) to the Church's practice of infant baptism being outmoded. I've had that thought more than once before. No priest in Singapore, at least none that I know, would dare say such things. The Church here and the Church in Singapore seem like two entirely different things. Yes, it's more or less the same mass. But listen to the priests speak here... very different.  This is in part due to politics. The Church in Singapore, I feel, is a product of its environment. Religion and politics in Singapore are so separate that the Church doesn't comment - once again, as far as I know - about issues that affect wider society but are within the purview of our beliefs and practices. Case in point - the employment of homosexuals in the civil service in Singapore. The Anglican Church issued a statement. The Catholic Church was strangely silent. Even if they had a public stand, I know what it would be.  On a side note: I remember reading in the ST Forum page a scathing letter about this employment of homosexuals, and it reeked of prejudice and fear. Sadly, the writer is a Christian, and used many dubious (but standard) 'Christian' arguements about the ethical and moral problems of homosexuality. Ironic that he even said, "Love the sinner, hate the sin". It was quite apparent in the words and tone of the letter that he wasn't practicing one half of his maxim.  Anyway, where was I?  I remember one of my politics lessons; we were talking about colonialism and the role of religion in that. The spread of Christianity by the colonists was not purely because wanted to share their faith. No, Christianity was spread so that the natives would be more pliant. "Turn the cheek"; "blessed are the meek". They shall inherit the earth indeed. I don't believe that missionaries set out to act as a quelling force; they were merely taken advantage of by colonial powers/elites looking for a cheap and easy way to get the natives to do as they pleased.   Hmmm... back to our normal programming. (How did I get from there to here?) All of this is just my opinion.   Keith, congratulations and welcome to the family.

      Michael Bublé's - pronounced 'boo-blay' - concert last night was absolutely   brilliant  ! (Apologies to Ee... you're going to miss a wonderful performance!)  Shanti passed me his album (mp3s) some time back, and I thought he wasn't too shabby. He's a young jazz/swing singer... Actually, that's too restrictive, he's a lot more talented than that. Anyway, I received my weekly ticketek e-mail newsletter, saw that he was performing here, and told Shanti about it.  Those of you that know her, you can imagine her reaction.  Anyway, she posted a message in COSDU's yahoogroup and made an announcement after one of our Friday COSDU sessions asking if anyone else wanted to go... but no one was interested.  So, it was just the two of us. The concert was at The Next Blue - my first time there. Knowing the usual crowd there, I can safely say that the average age of its patrons just went up by at least twenty years after last night.  He started singing at around 8 p.m. Backed up by a brass section, drums, guitar, keyboard and double bass, he sang as one with them. It was quite amazing, and a faulty microphone only served to become an improvised part of his first song. If I remember correctly, he then launched into ' The Way You Look Tonight '. By then I was thinking that more of the COSDU people should have been there.  He also did  Fever ; he sang my favourite George Michael song,  Kissing a Fool ; he did  Moondance ; and would you believe... Queen's  Crazy Little Thing Called Love  swing style! He also did stuff not from his album, the most impressive of which was this  rap , which he jokingly claimed he co-wrote with Snoop Dog. (Did I get his name right?) He also charmed the ladies, coming down from the stage to let one dewy-eyed fan take a photo with him. He also spotted someone in the audience calling her friend to let the friend listen to the concert, and he took the handphone, crooning to the person on the line. His stage presence, improvisational skills and charm aside, the guy is superbly talented.  I was impressed to the extent that after the concert I bought his album at crazy Australian prices. When was the last time I paid $25 for a CD in Singapore? 199... errr... 1990 or 1991, I think. Listening to the album at home, I must say that if you have the chance to watch Michael Bublé live,  GO ! It's be worth it - and for no extra cost, you get to listen to his band, who are brilliant in their own right. He'll be in Singapore on September 15th. Ee, I'm really sorry that you start your classes that night. He'll be back in Melbourne in January.  Okay, enough free promotion for someone that I don't know personally...  Earlier in the day, I had my Asia-Pacific Media Systems tutorial presentation. It was okay by my standards, but both my lecturer and tutor said it was good. Well, that was 10%, the important thing is the essay that stems from this presentation. That's 50% and due on 16th Sept. But I'll have to finish it by this weekend because I have two other essays to attend to (both due on 22nd Sept).  Before the concert, I realised that that was my very last presentation for my undergraduate studies.  That fact is still sinking in. Only six essays and two exams from here on end.   P.S. Just found out that tickets to his concert in Singapore are going for $100, $80 and $50. What a rip off! And the setting is all wrong. Suntec? Goodness....  I paid $25; it was in a lounge setting and just perfect. And I was less than 10 metres from the stage. I really hope the  urlLink SISTIC  website is right about the concert being two hours long. It was only just slightly more than an hour here in Melbourne. To think I got to watch him live AND buy his CD for the price of the cheapest concert ticket in Singapore...

      I was doing research for my Asia-Pacific Media Systems presentation, and I came across this site:   urlLink CY Leow's Photoblog    He's a press photographer, and he's got some Merdeka-themed photos on his blog currently. I'd recommend that you visit his blog, especially if you're Malaysian. Bet it'll make you go all gooey with patriotism. =) It's not the just photos, he's got short write-ups on each photo including some photography tips.  Amazing what I find in the course of my research...  Okay, back to preparing for my presentation.

      That's one of the main taglines for the ongoing  urlLink Rugby World Cup . I have to say that I've been quite distracted by the tournament. My essays and exams have taken a back seat. I really enjoy watching rugby. Partly because it's not on as often as football. I treasure it a lot more. And it's something I could have been proficient at too...  Why oh why did I refuse my friends' invitation to try out rugby when I was in Saint Joseph's? Why did I quit rugby after three months in junior college? Actually, that should be: Why did I run for student council instead of staying on in the rugby team? And a related question: Why did I refuse my friends' invitation to play squash? (I only picked it up after much persuasion - from Theresa - at the ripe young age of 20.) All these "what ifs"... I shan't dwell on the "what could have and should have been".  Speaking of colours, I took this test I found on  urlLink Christine 's blog.    You're orange! Your bold, courageous and proud of who you are.    urlLink   Color Personality Test     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Never pegged myself as an orange person. Perhaps I should start supporting Holland in football. Someone did mention that all the sports teams I like are clad in red, black and/or white. But then, I like blue...  P.S. Added  urlLink Chevelle 's and  urlLink Marcus 's blogs to my list of links. Also, check out  urlLink friendster ! A wonderful way to procrastinate, like we need another way to wile our time away...

      The break has whizzed by... so many things have happened. But right now, two things that piss me off:  Denise is online, telling me about my uncles and aunties. Once again, there's conflict among them because of the perennial "Who gets to take care of Mother" debate. My mum is apparently the selfish one in all this. My foot. Mum has done more for her mum than all my uncles and aunts combined. I'm seriously pissed off.  I don't care if some of my relatives think I am arrogant idiot. When I go back home, they are going a good tongue-lashing from me. I don't know if they take my relative silence during family gatherings as arrogance, or just me being like my dad - the quiet type - but they should be thankful I'm not in Singapore for Christmas, 'cos I'm not going to be in a very charitable mood.  I'm so disgusted that now they have a taste of what my family has experienced for  over 20  years, they actually have the gall to suggest that my mum should still do her bit. Don't they care about my grandmother? Don't they bother about my mum?  ----------  Thursday night during Keith's birthday at Frost Bites I bumped into Grace. It was a pleasant surprise, but what happened later wasn't. Some time during the night, Lydia told me that she'd fainted, and that her friends brought her home. I was a bit worried, so I messaged her. Also called her the next day, but got her answering machine. I didn't make much of it, and I left a message.  She emailed me later to tell me that her drink had been spiked and that she ended up in hospital. I'm damn angry on her behalf, even though she said that it's in the past. She also said she doesn't know who spiked her drink.  Grace may have forgiven the person who spiked her drink. I'm finding it a bit hard to do likewise.

      A few of the graduating COSDUans met at Sr. Theresa's for a short day of prayer on Friday. It was a good session. I got time to myself and time with God to talk about the big G. It is going to mean change on many levels. Most of all, it means that relationships will change. I won't say much more about the session except to share the closing hymn from that session:    Galilee Song    1. Deep within my heart I feel voices whispering to me words that I can't understand meanings I must clearly hear Calling me to follow close lest I leave  myself behind Calling me to walk into evening shadows one more time  Refrain: So we leave our boats behind Leave them on familiar shores Set our hearts upon the deep Follow you again, my Lord  2. In my memories I know how you send familiar rains falling gently on my days dancing pattern on my pain And I need to learn once more in the fortress of my mind To believe in falling rain as I travel deserts dry  3. As I gaze into the night down the future of my years I'm not sure I want to walk past horizons that I know But I feel my spirit called like a stirring deep within Restless, 'till I live again Beyond the fears that close me in   I'm missing people already, especially those who have left. I'm missing those who are still around.  Mir, thanks for the good chat.

      Yesterday, I played basketball with Jason, Nicholas, Hobart and two of Hobart's friends. I played as though it was 1993. I played with all the exuberance of a 16-year-old.  And I'm now paying the price. This is not a case of "I'm getting old". Rather, it's a case of "Damn, I haven't played basketball this intensely for a long time". My lower back is protesting for the second night in a row. Consecutive nights of massages from Florence and Christine respectively have helped a little. The solution to this problem? Play MORE basketball... =)  Once I've recovered, that is. Hope the backache disappears before I head to the Gold Coast.

      (to be updated)  I woke up late in the morning after sleeping at about 4 a.m. after drinks at Felicia's. Lydia had organised a picnic at Lincoln Square at 12.30 p.m. I got ready and thought about wearing my new Collingwood t-shirt that Christine gave me. Anyway, I was there on time, and was the first one there. Everyone else was on COSDU time as usual. =P Lydia, Diana, Florence, Adrian, Shu'an and Jason came and we sat around and chit-chatted a while before Diana said the opening prayer. I hadn't noticed that Diana failed to mention food in her grace before the meal... And I noticed there was an egg carton; I assumed it was hard-boiled eggs.  Next thing I know, raw eggs, flour, water and chocolate milk were dumped unceremoniously on me. I just sat there and took it. I think that spoilt a bit of the fun of the 'saboing', and I did not react adversely so that the fun would be dampened a bit. I think some took it to mean that I was really angry. On the contrary, I was strangely honoured. I don't recall anyone else having been sabo-ed like that in COSDU over the two years I've been here.     the birthday boy covered in flour, eggs, chocolate milk and water      drinks at pugg's: a few  cosdu  gals, an old friend from cjc and me =)

      Joanne, my Meat &amp; Chocolate Queen, decided to organise a dinner for a small group the day before my birthday. This small group consisted of her, Florence, Jason, Felicia, Ming Ying and yours truly. I had absolutely no idea where she was taking us. And I only found out before we set off that we had to travel by train and tram to get there. (Initially, I thought it was  just  a train ride.) This place is called Limor's, along Kooyong Road. The previous day was dessert heaven. Today was meat, meat and more meat. It wasn't just quantity either. This place has turned the art of cooking meat into... well... let's just say that I won't be buying chicken schnitzel from VicMart and grilling it myself. The texture, the flavour, the... damn, salivating just recalling the meal!     jason, felicia, ming yin, me, florence (and joanne taking the photo) on the way to felicia's for drinks   We ate our fill and proceeded to Felicia's place for drinks. Joanne played that drinking game that did in Florence and Sarah during the mid-semester break. I partnered Felicia, and she must have wondered what she did to deserve her luck. Without explaining the whole game, I'll say this much: we had to take 16 shots of vodka orange shots  each  for the last three rounds of the game combined. With the amount we consumed in the earlier rounds, Felicia K/Oed almost immediately after the game. I was my usual huggy self when high. Somewhere in between all this, I began getting birthday phone calls and smses. Joanne also gave me some group photos from her camera over the past couple of years which she had printed out. Lovely!

      Christine decided to book me for Wednesday evening after my final exam (yes, no more exams for...ever, perhaps) for dessert. She brought me to this place called Laurent along Little Collins Street. The desserts there are small and pricey but, as I was to discover, well worth it. There were only two chocolate desserts - the  Concorde : an all chocolate mousse thing, and the  Christine . Yes, I kid you not. The little piece of heaven is called  Christine . It is a chocolate mousse confection with a brownie base and a creme brulee centre. That sounded more exciting than the  Concorde , so I had  Christine  for dessert. And of course, it gives you people an excuse to exercise your over-active imaginations and me, a chance to play with words.  So, I ate  Christine  as Christine and I chatted.  Christine  was delightful, so rich that I was forced to eat  Christine  slowly. If chocolates were clouds, this would be nine.  Christine also started the ball of gifts from COSDUans rolling along. I have to say that I've never had such quality presents in such numerous quantity. Some were tangible, some intangible. Some things I wanted, some pleasant surprises. All were absolutely terrific and thoroughly appreciated. Getting back to Christine's gift, it was more of a hamper. A pair of helium-filled balloons to put me in a party mood, Collingwood items galore and a photobook on friendship, lovingly annotated with personal messages.

      Chevelle, one of my closest friends from Ngee Ann Poly, made a whirlwind two-day trip to Melbourne. I managed to meet her, and we caught up over coffee. It was terrific to meet her and have a chat. ICQ or whatever doesn't cut it sometimes. Most of the time, in fact.  She said that she loves the New Zealand national anthem. I love it too. It's just a beautiful hymn unlike... Well, Velle, here's the link to God Defend New Zealand, complete with lyrics, score and a few downloadable variations of the anthem.  urlLink   New Zealand National Anthems    (Yes, there are two: the other one is God Save the Queen.)  Which brings me to the fateful match.  Met up with Christine, Lydia and Nicholas for dinner, then proceeded to Federation Square. The place was buzzing.  We saw Joanne with a friend of hers. Ming and Adrian Loo turned up, with a few of Adrian's friends. Found out another friend, another Lydia, was watching the game at Fed Sq too.  Most people stood up for both National Anthems. The Haka was performed with particular ferocity.  Where the ferocity went once the whistle blew is something only the All Blacks can answer. I'm lucky I'm not a Kiwi. The New Zealanders are going to wake up tomorrow with more than bruised egos, and the team, with more than bruised bodies.  Australia did what they haven't been doing the whole tournament: getting the basics right. The only hint of unforced errors came from Mat Rogers almost at the end. Trust me, the guy, together with Wendell Sailor, are the weak links in the Wallabies defence. Put them under pressure and see them crumble.  Unfortunately, the All Blacks couldn't put pressure on them. But that's because they couldn't get their hands on the ball, especially in the first quarter of the game. But that, arguably (and circuitously) was because they weren't putting pressure on the Oz forwards.  But the boys in gold were determined. I remember the look on Gregan's face when Kelleher put his hands in the ruck. His veins were pumped, and Gregan let Kelleher know how stupid he was for making the error.  Nevermind, I still support the All Blacks. And there's England. The last thing I want to see is an Australia-France final. I might not even watch the final if that happens.  I'm still traumatised by the game and the outcome. *sigh* Really disappointed. Celine, I feel your pain. For me, I hope it won't be compounded tomorrow night.

      The festivities began early for me. Chevelle was down for a whirlwind tour of Melbourne. Actually, it was two days - the first touring Great Ocean Road and the second meeting up with friends. So, she didn't even get to see much of Melbourne at all! Coincidentally, the two days she was here marked a dramatic increase in temperature. Friday was the first day above 30 degrees in many months. Saturday was a scorcher: somewhere between 37 to 39 degrees depending on whose weather report you believe. More amazingly, Melbourne decided to become cold and wet almost the whole of last week, following Chevelle's visit! Some people bring rain, some people bring sunshine. =)  Sarah dropped Velle off along Swanston Street and we caught up over coffee in the (thankfully) air-conditioned Tiamo 2. Velle has always been a breeze to talk to, and we were chatting like we usually did, even though I haven't seen her for a while. Before we parted, she gave me an advance birthday present. =) Thanks for the 'insults', Velle. ;P

      	It's been a while since I last wrote. The past two weeks have been a bittersweet and surreal time for me. My last lecture. My last tutorial. My last...  	The 'last' list is endless, and the worst 'lasts' are the ones I don't realise until they've past. Two Fridays ago - 23 Oct - was the last COSDU session for this semester and for me (at least for the foreseeable future). It was a mini-affirmation session of sorts. There was plenty of emotion, but it was kept in check partly because time was limited. Lydia asked me after the session why I didn't say anything. Well, I did share a bit, but obviously it was the tip of the iceberg. I told her that if I had said all that I wanted to say, we'd have been at Kenny Lounge the entire night. Also, I personally don't like this idea of finality. It's slow death of sorts. We know it's coming. We know it's inevitable. But affirmation is important. Testimony is important. It's life-giving.  	But there are these things called exams, assignments, essays and projects. Which is why we are in University. Or is it? Conventional wisdom dictates that these are the be-all and end-all. What's getting in the way of what? I don't know. Come to think of it, I don't know if what I'm writing is making sense any more. (Taking Sr. Theresa's advice to a good friend and applying it to myself. What you read is usually the result of careful consideration, re-writing and editing. This time, it's just me typing away. It's raw.)  	Consider this. I'm procrastinating. I've gone past my personal deadlines but still have ample time to hand in my essays. That leaves me with less time to do important things. Like express my feelings for the friends I will miss when I depart. And yet, I adamantly refuse to write any more testimonials on  urlLink friendster . Why? Stated reason: I have plenty of other ways to procrastinate. Actual reason: Refusal to let go of friends down under.  	So much so that *gasp* I considered for just a moment - a brief, fleeting moment during the homily at St. Carthage's on All Souls' Day - about getting a PR and working here.  	Nah. Singapore needs me more than this land of golden soil and wealth for toil. And I certainly don't need Australia. Anyway, the crux of all this is time. Too much to do, too little time. Maybe I will write those testimonials. It's not like I'm stressed out by my essays and exams anyway. =P  	Fast foward to Exam Mass. Christine spoke about Patsy. It was heart-wrenching stuff. Tears were on the verge of streaming. Perhaps they should have. It's not easy to lower our emotional defences in full view of familiar and not-so-familiar eyes. Lydia gave a heartfelt sharing about the graduating COSDU members. I was touched deeply and completely. If ever any of our involvement with COSDU could be summarised into succint encomium, Lydia has done so, with humour, eloquence, sincerity and love. Thank you, Lydia.  	I wrote the following for the Exam Mass edition of the COSDU newsletter. And I want to share it with everyone. It may be a little repetitive, but it's worth repeating:  --------------------  	I've been pondering hard about what to write ever since Joanne asked me to pen something - long or short - about COSDU. Somehow, I can't seem to get very far but it's not because I don't have anything good to say. On the contrary, I think there's just too much to say. 	 	COSDU has been like a family to me.   	No, let me be more precise.  	COSDU   is   family to me. There's our Father, God. Plenty of 'mothers' full of care and concern. Brothers and sisters to chat with, to share with, to argue with and to love. We try to be welcoming to all, and we're fiercely protective of our own.  	I'm fortunate to have been part of COSDU. I don't think I thank God enough for each and every one of you. Most of you are a short walk or an Optus Time phone call away. I take that for granted sometimes. Soon enough, that will change for those graduating and returning home.  	That's one of the things I'm going to miss: being in close physical proximity to most of you. It's quite different having lived 'far away' in North Melbourne, compared to my current place in Carlton, at the doorstep of Uni, Chaplaincy, Lygon Street and most importantly, the majority of COSDU.  	It's going to take some getting used to. Not being able to walk over to kacau others. No Friday night sessions. No monthly mass. No friendly faces in Chaplaincy. No laughs at La Porcella. No waiting to decide if we want to go to La Porcella. No daily lunchtime Rosary or Bible sharing... I could go on.  	What I have, what we have, is common experience. We have shared pleasant and not-so-pleasant memories: Easter Camps, Confirmations and Baptisms, the Central Australia trip, the Grampians trip, rockclimbing, movies, meals, sports, watching footy, the Tulip farm, the COSDU forum debacle, committee disagreements, finding out about Sulina's leukaemia. Once again, I could go on.  	Suffice to say, I treasure these. I treasure these because of the people who were with me. I am divided as to whether I should mention names. On one hand, there have been so many individuals who I must mention. People who have listened to me, been there for me, taken care of me, cooked for me... People who have shown their best and worst sides to me and likewise, I have shown my best and worst to them. And yet, we still accept and love each other.  	On the other hand, I hold everybody in COSDU close to my heart. Even if we are not really close, I have to say that everyone's presence enhances COSDU, makes is a vibrant and loving community. A family. Sometimes, it's just a few words or a smile that can make my day and I wouldn't want to leave out anyone who has in some way been a part of my life. I suppose I'll not mention names here and have a good chat with those I need to thank personally.  	I'm feeling a great sense of loss as I'm writing this. Time is so short. Two weeks remain of my final semester in University. One month of exams, and then... the end? Why did I bother? Isn't it better to have kept to myself? If I didn't risk getting to know others, I wouldn't risk having to part. It's so much easier to do that but that's not what I wanted. When I joined COSDU, I gave my all. For me, if there's no risk in a relationship, it's not love. It's just a mechanical attachment if a relationship is iron-clad. So, in giving my all, I now feel sad that I have to leave.  	Although it may be the end of my time in Melbourne, it's not the end of my relationships with friends in COSDU. People just don't come and go. They are only fleeting if we let them drift out of our lives. We don't just live in Carlton or in Parkville. We live in each other's hearts and minds. We can keep in touch... although it won't be the same. Still, it's important to maintain that link. If we don't then it's truly a loss. If we don't, the point of our bonds here seems hopelessly futile. I'm sad to leave but I don't think my relationships here have been in vain.  	All of you are wonderful. Keep on being a family away from home. Keep on growing in Christ. God Bless!

      I'm home.  It's strangely familiar.  Familiar, yet strange.  I guess I have to adapt back to life here. It's quite different from Melbourne. Some things better, some things worse. But, as I always say, it's still home.  I visited one of my relatives yesterday. My uncle was quite surprised to see me. I think his exactly words were, "I'm surprised you didn't stay there." Well, that 's me. Contemplated getting an Oz PR for about a full two seconds the entire time I was there.  Damn funny, in the supermarket near my place, there's a corner called "Liberty Market", selling all the American stuff. Then there's the "Australian Pavilion"... decorated with Aussie flags and all. It's just a little corner, but it really transported me back to Safeway. Hahaha... they even have Aussie beers that I never knew existed. Have James Boag. Cascade. Fosters (of course). But no Carlton. =(  Hmmm... come to think of it, never checked the prices so probably wouldn't have bought it anyway. But was good to see all the Australian stuff in one corner... the SPC stuff, the Goldburn Valley canned fruits, the Arnotts snacks, even the hopeless sweet chilli that they have in Safeway!  The New Paper has descended into... well... let me fill in some context first. It's something like the Herald Sun in Melbourne. Tabloid-size newspaper that people like me read purely for sports news. Now almost half the newspaper is devoted to one of two things: hotlines for football gambling "professional" tips and ads (full page ones) for ringtones and other mobile-phone related paraphernalia. My goodness... Well, at least all the ads are paying for very extensive coverage of the English Premier League.  Another surprise. Loaded magazine on sale at the news stands. What are people here complaining about censorship for? Maybe it's a local version. I should research that. =P Put it this way, in the world of men's magazines it's somewhere between FHM/Ralph and Playboy.  I remember reading in Shu'an's blog about the service (or lack thereof) here. Personally, I'd rather be sincerely ignored than mechanically greeted. Do the check-out people in Melbourne really give a shit how our days are going?  I'm in between the limbo of the student world and the working world. My friends here talk about jobs, money, houses, cars, etc. etc. Fair enough. I suppose, in due time, I'll be talking about all these too. I wonder if we will get around to talking about things that really matter.  I've been wanting to reformat my computer and do a clean install of everything. I was told that that's what I'm doing with my life right now. A more or less accurate observation about my return to Singapura.

      Finally have some time off to write a short blog entry. Bringing family around is arduous and tiring. I'm glad to have my parents around and more than happy to show everyone around, but suddenly having to deal with everyone's idiosyncracies all at once is, well...  Irritating.  This 'holiday' is not normal life. I barely have time to do anything. And I'm not really doing anything. Been to most of the places I've been bringing my family around too. So much so that I've not taken a single photo since graduation. Amazing.  Phillip Island today. But first, have to accompany my sister to the city to get some chocolate.  Somehow supposed to pack all my stuff in an hour, before I meet Denise. Guess I'll just have to do it after Phillip Island. Don't see myself arriving home until midnight.  Joanne's leaving today. Which makes me realise I haven't had time to write any cards or buy presents or anything.  So many things left undone. Seems like the same old story.  Everyone's either not blogging or blogging that they are happy to get away and be left alone. We all need a break. The COSDU Yahoo Group is gathering dust. (Just vocalised yesterday that the next time the group picks up, I'll only be an observer from afar. Something I've known for some time, but just haven't said out loud.)  As I'm writing all this, I suddenly realise that I need MY OWN BREAK. Away from family and friends. I'm not going to get it though, unless I keep a low profile when I'm back home. Then it's the KL trip.  Read Patsy's crossroads entry. Dunno. Feel that that's all the things we are supposed to hear, supposed to believe in. Doesn't make the pain go away. Doesn't make me feel any better. Grow? Yeah, I'm growing all the time.  Wasn't intending to write a depressed blog entry but hey, that's the way I'm feeling at this very moment.  P.S. Re: bachelor of arts - Admin error. Doesn't say much for the University of Melbourne.

      I'm pissed off. I'm tired.  The weather yesterday was unbearable. That made photo-taking quite a pain. And it's difficult to take proper photos in harsh light. But I went through it anyway, knowing that at the end of the day, life goes on. The ceremony is just a ceremony. I was looking forward more for graduation to be over than the actual graduation itself.  It's one of the last few times I take photos with COSDUans in Melbourne, at least for the immediate future.  Anyway, I'm not pissed off and tired because of the photo-taking or any of the peripheral activities that surround graduation. I'm pissed off because they got my degree wrong.  I swear I was studying to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts (Media & Communication). As I looked through the programme, I found my name under Bachelor of Arts.   No (Media & Communication). There were about five listed as graduating with BA (M&C). Sarah, Michelle and Chalres were among them. There were a few BA (M&C) students who were in the same quandary.  Could I have been so stupid as to not complete the requirements for BA (M&C)? Worse, could I have filled in my declaration to graduate wrongly? What irony it would be that my first step as a graduate was make this kind of error. Like I've never filled in a form before.  Admin error. Admin error. Has to be an admin error. I'll off to Uni now, hopefully for one last time, to find out.

      My family arrived in Melbourne this morning. I was at the airport at 7.10 a.m. Their flight was scheduled to arrive at 6.55 a.m. but arrived at 7.05 a.m. That meant I was only five minutes late. Well, that's assuming customs didn't exist.  An hour went past. This, I thought, was normal. The first time I arrived in Melbourne, it took me about an hour to clear customs. I was not duly worried. 8.30 a.m. approached. I was supposed to collect the house keys from Ming Yin's sister at this time. But I was still at the airport. Msged to say that I'd be late. Also told Joanne that I'd need the car a little longer than expected.  8.30 a.m. came and went. Sometime or other, the flight was off the arrivals board. I tried calling Denise and Mum. Phones not available. Hmmm... couldn't be that I got the wrong date. Called home. No answer.  After nearly TWO hours of waiting, I finally catch sight of Denise. The story is that the airplane landed but had to REVERSE or something. Probably missed the gate or was reassigned to another gate. Problem: Impatient Singaporeans already standing up, waiting to de-plane. Aircraft couldn't move until EVERYONE was seated.  So that took some time.  This delay caused a jam at customs because there were two or three other flights that arrived at the same time. Actually, they arrived later but the standing up fiasco caused most of the passengers from the few consecutive flights to turn up at the customs desk simultaneously. Further delay.  Meanwhile, SQ baggage goes round and round the mulberry bush.  More flights and baggage arrive, so SQ227 baggage get downgraded from mulberry bush to floor.  Meanwhile, I go take a dump and place my clip-on sunnies on the toilet paper dispenser. Reminder to self: Take clip-ons after doing business.  I come out of the toilet, and finally see my entire family!  Almost forget to pay for parking. Suddenly remember that I left my clip-ons in the toilet... too late!  40 km/h traffic on the Tullamarine Highway. Thank goodness for small mercies. If I had been in a cab, the trip would have cost a bomb.  ------------------  We have an early lunch at Stalactites, a Greek place on Lonsdale. Good Souvlaki! =)  Bump into Michelle and her mum on Swanston. Bring my parents to the Rialto, then to the Shrine and to the Royal Botanical Gardens. Pass by rehearsals for 'Shakespeare in the Park'. Lead actor not bad.  After going around a bit, pass by the actors again on the way out. Take closer look at lead. No. Can't be. Hugo Weaving???  a.k.a. Agent Smith (in the Matrix)  Someone told me before that he's Australian. (I thought he was British.)  Family debates about actor's identity. I argue that he looks the same as the character in the Matrix, what's more, he's wearing sunnies and bears an uncanny resemblance to Smith. Just have to picture him in a suit instead of the Outback outfit (complete with cowboy hat) that he was wearing. Denise said that his voice was the same (once you ignore his native Aussie accent).   Hmmm... the last time we were on holiday, we saw a man in Venice who looked exactly like Antonio Banderas. He vehemently denied it of course.  ------------------  Tommorrow is graduation! I think it's finally sunk in... =)

      It's on.  First, a few apologies. Sorry for not updating my blog. I've been away on holiday in Queensland. The Sunshine State. Our of eight days there, only two could be considered sunny.   I also suffered a relapse of my back injury after a few rides on the first day of our 'Worlds' visits. The Lethal Weapon ride caused quite a bit of discomfort and another ride which brought us upside down quite a number of times did my back in.  After my backache subsided a bit, my body decided to react to the weather by coming down with a bad cold and sore throat. It really tired me out, and the on and off headache didn't help either.  So, Florence, Joanne, Michelle, Adrian and Hobart, sorry for being a pain in the arse/neck/back. My bad back and my cold didn't do wonders for my temper or my driving. I know I was snappy and just not very nice. I apologise... sorry. I hope I didn't ruin the holiday for all of you.  The trip was still good overall. I enjoyed the driving I when it wasn't wearing me out. I enjoyed the Tamborine Mountain the most. I wish I had gone to the Australia Zoo though. We drove right by on our way to and from the Sunshine Coast. Steve Irwin's zoo! Oh well, another time...  But there were lots of funny little incidents as there are whenever a group of COSDUans are together. The Polar Bear exhibit at Sea World was the thing I enjoyed most during the trip. There were two polar bears. One was a recluse, but the other was so playful and intelligent. A really showoff! The polar bear was cute, rubbing his eyes like we would once it surfaced from the water. And it played with one of its toys, alternately hiding it in a crevice under water and retriveing it, letting it float to the surface.  Brisbane and the Uni of Queensland were beautiful. I must go back there one day.  Today was spent packing and getting back up to speed on the latest happenings. Blogs are wonderful. My suitcase is already 30kg and I haven't even finished using up all the space. Guess I'll have to take out some heavier items and pad the bag with lighter stuff. Probably will get in touch with Jetta Express. (How's that for plugging for a company/service that I've never used before? Speaking of plugging, the Coca-Cola bit in the Sea Lion show in Sea World was sooooo bad I can't believe they agreed to it. I suppose they really need the money from sponsorship to take care of the wildlife.)  Back to the trip...  The driving reminded me of my times driving with Damian. Rather, me sitting in the car while he drove.  The reef fish in Sea World reminded me of Felicia.  The Champions Rugby store in Surfers Paradise reminded me of Celine and Christine.  Two people I care about dearly were at Niagra Falls within a few days of each other, and both told me about their trips there.  And I have been reminded that I have been truly loved.  Right now, my mind is all over the place. I'm thinking about packing. I'm thinking about what needs to be settled. I'm thinking about how I'm going to maximise my time over the next few days before my family arrives. I'm thinking about so many disparate things...  It hasn't really sunk in that I'm GRADUATING.     outside UQ

      Today was my first packed day - besides the KL trip - that I've had in ages. I must say it feels good to get out of the house but at the same time, I'm quite mindful that I can't have too many of these. Unless I find a source of income, temporary or permanent.  This said Saturday began with squash at Yio Chu Kang with Cheryl. I haven't played squash since just after the exams. I've grown fatter since then, so I was quite slow today. Still, it felt great to exert myself a bit. And my competitive spirit/streak had a chance to be let loose. Cheryl has been playing on and off, and we're both still evenly matched. I honestly thought she wasn't playing 100% today. After about half an hour, I was really tired. But then, when I played in Melbourne, there were always a lot of people to rotate with. Today was just one hour non-stop squashing the ball. Damn, it felt so good...  Went home, showered, then went to Mount Alvernia hospital to visit Yani, Ben and baby Sophie. I didn't stay long, and Sophie was asleep while I was there. She's really adorable... So small and fragile. Truly amazing...  I then headed to Sixth Avenue for Nasi Bryani with Michelle and Sam. Really good to see Michelle again, the last time was at graduation, and prior to that was before she left Melbourne. Sam, I haven't seen in a year or so. Bryani was excellent, just as I remember it... only not served on banana leaf. They claimed they ran out. I'm always surprised by my meetings with Sam. To think that we were not exactly on talking terms during first year in mass comm. Well, stranger things have happened in my life. And most people know that a similar dynamic existed between me and Damian for ages. How things change...  Lately, long lost friends have been getting in touch with me. I don't recall mentioning it before, but a primary school classmate got in touch with me. He got my contact info from ICQ. So, when I got a strange SMS from Indo asking me if this is Kenneth Pinto, I was quite sure it was someone from COSDU playing around. Well, turns out the SMS was sent by an Indonesian guy who was my classmate in upper primary at Saint Anthony's. He also found the link to my blog... which is how he discovered what happened to Miss Tan/Mrs Choo. He did want to contact me to see if he could get in touch with her. I'm quite sad he had to find out that way.  Anyway, still on the long lost friends road: I went for sunset mass after meeting Michelle and Sam. I hadn't attended sunset mass at Risen Christ for ages. I usually attend 6 p.m. on Sunday or go somewhere else. I've never really got used to the new priests, the new atmosphere, the new surroundings. Nevermind the building, the church community I knew and loved had 'disappeared' for me ever since I was studying in mass comm. Those were low days, then I had the half year break before uni which changed my life. That change continued on in Melbourne. But returning home, it was hard to find my niche in church. It had become a building once again. One I wasn't entirely familiar with (since the extensions were added) at that.  I saw Adrian Mak. As surprises go, this one ranks up there with my many birthday surprises. But that was merely the glint of sunlight through the crack of the window. Adrian was an altar server way back. He joined before I did. I joined in primary six, and got to know him then. He then went to SJI, as I did. And we were classmates in Secondary Three and Four. He quit the servers before I did, and we went to different junior colleges, which spelt the end of our keeping in touch. National Service brought us back together for two months. We were in the same Medic Specialist course. I've seen many sides of Adrian, and he was at one point, my best friend.  This guy is an absolute genius. How he never made it to medicine remains one of the mysteries of the universe. He was devastated to say the least. His application for dentistry didn't go through, and he found out while at the medic course. But the Adrian I met today would probably have said that was God working in his life. He became quite withdrawn - so I heard - when I was in poly. I knew he attended mass at St Bernadette's. And I suspect he, like me, stopped going for mass regularly at one point or another.  Back to the present: He told me he was doing his PhD in Chemistry. Did I mention that he learnt Tamil in class in between lessons? Anyway, I told him that he took another route to being a doctor. He said it was an even better route... Something was definitely different about him. Another surprise: he was a cathecist.  Digression: Now I have two old friends who are cathecists at Risen Christ. Lester and Adrian. Both Altar Servers. Both Josephians. Both know my aunt who is also a cathecist. (Oh, and Joseph Soh, who works with refugees, knows my uncle Gordon.)  Needless to say I was gobsmacked. He asked what I was doing, and suggested relief teaching. Said that he did it, and it was a life-changing experience. Anyway, he half-jokingly suggested I become a cathecist too. He was the second one to do that. No prizes for guessing who was first.  Mass. An unfamiliar priest said Mass - Fr. William Goh, professor at the major seminary. And the sermon was surprisingly fiery. He started off saying that the problem with the world today is amorality. Faith issues aside, he went from pro-PAP (paraphrase: as GCK said, if the family falls apart - goodness, the Asian values arguement. If only that was truly Asian, and there are universal truths). I was saying to myself at one point, it's no wonder Singaporeans will never vote against the PAP... even church leaders are preaching their word from the pulpit. He even quoted, "regardless of race, language or religion". THEN, he said that Jesus came to save us ALL, not just Catholics. Hmmm... agreed there.  From there, he swung to anti-government (or at least took a contrary view to the party in power) concerning the death penalty. That, he said, was not on. He did make good points about love and forgiveness interspered with highly debateable theological and political views. Anyway, I was seated in the gallery, looking down... and saw another Adrian. Fannster. Great! Someone from Melbourne to discuss the sermon with. Well, I'm quite sure Fr. Goh was not making a political statement of any sort. Still, it was thought and faith provoking stuff. Finally, a sermon that spoke to me... If I was a seminarian, the seminary would be all blood and thunder. Metaphorically.  Anyway, also spotted in the crowd: Adrian Mak's and my fellow friend, Lester. Hmmm... We used to all stay in Bishan, so we'd go home after classes together, especially when we were in the afternoon session in Secondary One. Those were great days. Weekdays we saw each other in school. Weekends, we saw each other in church. We knew who was interested in whom. Ooops... reminiscing again...  After mass, Adrian and I chatted with Lester for a while. Lester, too, was surprised he became a cathecist. Adrian said it was a long story... We're going to meet up to hear it. From the little he has revealed, I know it's going to be very interesting, and would probably echo some of my personal experiences.  I went home feeling good about having attended sunset mass. It was no coincidence. Adrian said he hardly ever attended sunset mass too. For the first time in a long time, I felt community in church. My good old friends seemed not so far away, not mere figments of my memory... Chapters that I considered closed in my life have reopened. There are more pages to write yet. Having to leave COSDU opened a gap in my spiritual life. Perhaps that gap will be filled soon...

      (to be updated) has appeared in my blog quite a number of times. Sadly, I've not got around to updating those entries. Sometimes, it's just pure procrastination. Sometimes... I wanted to write: "it's just me wondering if I should write what I have to say in my blog". But that's not true, I wouldn't even type (to be updated) if I'm unsure about whether I should write things. Anyway, I noticed a few of these (to be update)s around. I'm not exactly doing anything at the moment. Perhaps I should update them...  Tomorrow... =P  As for today, I had an amusing phone call in the evening. Oh, I did want to mention that the french film "Love me if you dare" is a brilliant film. I watched it on Monday. Lydia and Su Li watched it this evening. Don't think Lydia has any regrets paying $7.50 to watch it! Go watch, if it's still showing. You'll love it or you'll hate it. But go watch. That film is what a romance should be. Not the humdrum, predictable, saccharine, fluff that Hollywood hurls.  Anyway, today... A list, just so that people can ask me, "Did you manage to do so-and-so?" And so that I can answer, "Erm... Tomorrow."  1. Clean out desk/shelves/cupboard. 2. Write/Edit/Send resumes. 3. Disconnect old phone number. 4. Visit Sophie, Yani and Ben at Mt Alvernia. 5. Write some emails. 6. (And this one will take a gargantuan effort)  Exercise   One thing at a time, yah?

         A couple of days back, I attended a - don't laugh - baby shower. Now, I'm not an expert at having kids, but I swear baby showers were for women only, and that they happened after the baby was born. I had a good time even though the reason of us gathering was still snug in her mum's womb. One group of my mass comm friends were there. It was really good meeting up with them. The dynamic I have with each clique is different, but with the tequila bachelorettes, as they call themselves (an increasingly inaccurate term - and I'm an honourary member), I felt like I never left. Now, if Sophie could actually understand what was said that night... =P  Well, she has plenty of Godmothers to fawn and spoil her. And one Godfather who apparently is supposed to scare potential unwanted attention away when Sophie is older. The girls really have great imaginations. I'm really honoured to be considered a Godfather, as Catholic, and thus slightly incongruent in this case, that term is.  Obviously, our raucous gathering inspired little Sophie to say hi to the world a little earlier than expected. I was down at Mount Alvernia at about 7 p.m. We saw the baby at around 7.50 p.m. Looking at an infant, it's both easy and hard to comprehend life. But right now, I remember the smile on Ben's face.  Congratulations, Yani and Ben!

      The countries I've visited. The map below is quite misrepresentative though. For example, I've not visited anything west of Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon in the USA. And I was in a very small, beautiful part of America called Hawai'i for two months. I've only been at the border of Mexico. I certainly haven't spent any time on the Chinese mainland other than transit at Guangzhou! Most of my time in China was in Hainan ("The Second Largest Island of China after Taiwan!") Australia?

      i usually keep a travel diary but for some reason, i didn't write in it while i was in gold coast and during my recent trip to KL. Reading through it brought back lots of memories. I kept a relatively detailed memoir of my time in hainan. The intention was to write while i was in KL. Unfortunately, late nites and diarrhea during the second half of the trip kept me from writing regularly. Anyway, here are some random highlights:   closed  We tried to go to the science centre on friday. They were closed for  cuci  (washing). Adrian Loo joked that that's the reason everything there is  rosak  (spoilt)... always washing... water seeped into the displays...  My visit to Sunway was equally fruitless. Went on a tuesday. The one day of the week they were closed. The monorail was closed too...   sepang  Florence's mum tried to drive us around the track before picking Joanne up from the airport, but the guard refused to let us in. He claimed that it was past closing time. Well, undeterred, I made another trip there after the failed attempt at Sunway...  They didn't let us on to the track that day. The guard said it would cost a few thousand ringgit. Not having that kind of money, we decided to do the next best thing. Managed to park the car outside and walk in. For free! That was cool, going to the race track without any real restrictions. Couldn't go onto the track, but the rest of the areas were open. Of course, you must be wondering, what in the world is there to see at an empty track?  Well, I was more than happy to have access to areas which I wouldn't have the money to afford during an actual race. And the track wasn't empty that day! They were doing testing for GT cars... and what looked like F3 or F3000 cars! =) Soooo coool! The sound brought back memories of attending the F1 races in Melbourne. I can imagine what race day will be like at Sepang. Amazing stuff... hopefully my dad can get tix for Sepang this year. Unfortunately, if I do, I'll be seated in the HP corporate box... and HP sponsors BMW... Will have to keep my McLaren allegiance under wraps...   law & disorder  one of the bad (and good) things about malaysia is the apparent lack of rules. Things are haphazard and orderly somehow. Things are chaotic yet in control. But i (or nicholas, rather) had a brush with the law. We wanted to make a U-turn to go where we were going, but couldn't. There was a place where you technically could, but it was clearly marked with a no U-turn sign. Anyway, we continued straight along and before we knew it, we were at the guardhouse of the malaysian parliament house. The guard, who must have been bored witless, proceeded to scold nick for lack of driving skills and a whole load of other stuff. After what seemed like 15 minutes, he finally let us do what he could have let us done without any hassle - make a U-turn around the guard house. It was an honest mistake... but one that could have been prevented if Nick made an illegal U-turn earlier. Which is what the other KL and PJ ppl said we should have done... =P   eat eat eat  it seemed like there would be no tomorrow every day. i ate and ate and ate and ate... my stomach just gave up. on sunday after lunch at ming's, i felt really bloated. playing tennis that evening helped, but after that... nine-course chinese dinner with Adrian's family and his family's 'friends'. Oh, and it was a private room, one table. Complete with karaoke set... *shudder* anyway, i ate... and had to go to the loo. the beginning of many visits over the next three days. the food was good over the week i was in KL but it was just toooo much...   first time  thanks for the cosduans' visit, the locals have notched up plenty of firsts such as: - first time riding the LRT - first time riding the monorail - first time on the petronas twin towers' skybridge - first time going up the stairs at Batu Caves - first time going to the National Monument - first time driving in KL city  (to be continued)   piracy    luggage    thanks  ...to Adrian and his family for housing me and feeding me, I'm truly grateful. You are wonderful hosts! ...to Michelle and family, for organising the BBQ and plying us with copius amounts of  chinese tea  ...to Ming and family, for bringing us around your club and for organising the lunch ...to all those who drove us around and housed us, how would we have done without you?

      I wrote a cover letter, resume and a(n?) one page essay today. It's the first one I've had to do since graduating. The job title: Visual Resource Executive. If I get it, I'll be working so close to Malaysia, that I should bring my passport to work daily, just in case I get the chance to go across...  Hahaha... already dreaming that I got the job. It'll be cool. Damian is working there already. =)  Funny, I never saw myself working for the National Heritage Board. But then, there must be a reason I took the subject  Fact, Fiction and Fraud in the Digital Age . Yes, that was the class for which there were twenty people in lecture (at the beginning of semester) and five in my tute. And that was the class in the criminology building.  It was basically about records, evidence, referencing and inevitably, given my lecturers and tutors area of speciality, it was about archiving. And the job I applied for has everything to do with all that. Or as I joked to my sis: Oh, I'll basically photograph things and make sure people know how to find the photograph (and eventually the thing itself).  Anyway, having to write the essay required me to get some background on NHB. I think that was the first step (since arriving back home) in my ongoing quest to find things to do in Singapore.  --------------------  Mass was weird. Father... errr... Lee or Yeo... I STILL don't know who is who. (Why did the priests have to all rotate parishes just as I left for Melbourne?) Anyway, Father's sermon was a rant. One which I've been wanting a priest to do for a long time but when I finally heard it from a priest's mouth, it just seems wrong that he has to actually say all these things during mass. I went from glad that he mentioned all that he did to aghast that people need to be told all this. Even later on, I became really sad. (Pardon for the shifting tenses and grammatical errors, I'm multitasking online, and I'm not putting all my usual attention when writing.)  His parallel was the cinema and the church. You switch off the mobile in cinemas, he said. (Well, Father needs to attend movies more often, 'cos last I saw and heard, people still had their mobiles on in cinemas and still answered them.) Anyway, you should do likewise in church.   So, I was actually glad he mentions this. Then I remember chatting with Lydia, and what she related to me about her first day of work. They 'brainstormed' ground rules, most of which Lydia said was common sense and understood. She felt like she wasn't being treated like an adult. Like she didn't have any common sense. Maybe Singaporeans DON'T have any common sense. They don't call this the nanny state for nothing. Maybe Singaporeans NEED to be told how to do things, where and when we can do them and why we do so.  He then says, at the cinema, you tell your kids to keep quiet and watch the show. But in church, people gives toys to their kids to play. It reminds me of the time I saw a mum letting her kids do their Mandarin homework during mass. Once again, I was glad that Father brought it up. But then, he shouldn't have to bring it up at all.  So I go through the rest of mass quite disturbed. I really should have attended mass with Lydia but I couldn't finish my job application in time. So I went alone to Risen Christ. But the worst was yet to come. The previous week, I had to get used to the fact that when we wish each other the sign of peace in Singapore, it's strictly a non-contact thing. Bow respectfully. Peace be with you.  Well, today, I got blank, almost angry looks to go with the half-hearted bows. To think that I was working on my smiley face. I wasn't expecting to shake anybody's hands. I remember when I was still serving mass, we used to drum it into the servers that they should wish each other the sign of peace sincerely and with a smile. It's God's Peace you're wishing to the other, not your own. I felt really downhearted after the sign of peace.  Oh, Father also mentioned something about parents telling him that their kids don't want to go for mass any more. Basically, he lay the blame on the parents, saying that it's because the kids don't feel like they are getting anything out of mass.  Duh! His solution? Be an example, ya da ya da ya da... If only things were that simple, Denise would still be attending mass.  Okay, I should stop writing all these depressing sounding blogs. What to do, blogs are a good way of getting things off your chest. Think I should have a separate one for all the really angst ridden stuff. =P  KL trip coming soon... something happy to look forward to... =)

      my weekend began on friday night at 8.15 p.m. : lord of the rings trilogy at orchard cineleisure. i will never ever attend another movie marathon again. i'll only go if someone can guarantee me that the people who sit within earshot are not IRRITATING.  the extended versions of fellowship and two towers... hmmm... overall, the extra scenes in both helped enhance the story overall. however, it made fellowship really draggy. i fell asleep the first time i watched fellowship (that was on DVD). i suppose the novelty of seeing it on the big screen kept me awake this time round. as for two towers, the extra scenes enhanced the story too. in fact, the scenes enhanced the story so much that the reason why i liked two towers so much was diminished. gollum. there were hardly any new scenes involving gollum, and with extended scenes involving the other characters' paths, the gollum/frodo/sam storyline suffered.  the return of the king wasn't extended. and by the time the movie started, irritating man behind me was really getting on my nerves. it didn't make for a good time. the ordeal ended at about 7.30 a.m. got home at about 8.30 a.m., slept, and was up by 11.30 a.m.  from hanging out with one lydia (for the movie) to another lydia (forsaturday)... lydia managed to convince me to drag myself out of bed to meet a few cosdu people for lunch. deborah had just returned from melbourne, so that was the main reason to go. or so i thought. due to some miscommunication, she didn't turn up. still, had lunch with the p sisters, adrian, dennis and patsy. rather, i watched everyone eat. couldn't decide what to do after that, so ended up having dessert and fruits at scotts food court.  shortly after leaving scotts, the group was down to the sisters and i. Asked them to keep an eye out for anything that catches the eye - i wanted to finish my roll of film, left over from graduation. lydia confidently said that there was nothing to take photos of along orchard road.  a few minutes later, i was on my way to finishing my roll of film. while walking along, we heard the sound of drums coming from outside takashimaya. we crossed the road and a percussion group was busking. a largish crowd had gathered and the music was excellent. i love drums =) the group is called   wicked aura  . definitely have to catch them around some time.  who's says there's nothing to do in singapore?  anyway, lydia (who was in a convincing mood on saturday) managed to persuade me to attend novena with her. now, those who know me - catholics in particular - know that i avoid novena like a plague. why? well, the reasons are complex, but the succinct one is that i don't feel comfortable with it. the priest gave a semi-convincing homily. the main message was at the start and at the end - and to tell you the truth, i forgot what the main message was because he was going on a tirade about how parents should/should not raise their kids. yes father, you who does not have a family, is an expert on family life. i'd love to see him differentiate between the different types of cries a baby makes.  went to risen christ for sunset mass with my parents and kevin. had dinner, then went home. watched tv for a bit. killed time until the everton-united match. aiyoh, heart attack! united have not played like this for a long time. i've been getting used to them having a water-tight defence. how we miss rio. now, it seems like we've gone back to "whatever you score, we'll score more than you". on the bright side, when united last played this brand of cavalier football, they won everything. on the other hand, the defence is such a shambles that it's hard to imagine them beating the big guns in europe.  had a good conversation with adrian loo, who was similarly aghast at united's second half capitulation.  slept at 3+  was awake at 8 a.m. somehow. got a sms from trees: something about cloudy weather and cancelling kayaking. i readily agreed, and went back to bed. when i next opened my eyes at about noon, there were six messages on my phone. apparently, we were now meeting for lunch. that got cancelled too... sort of. i eventually met damian, ja, trees, michele, cheryl and her cousin for... well, walking around actually. didn't really feel we were doing anything. went to suntec and back. ended up at star*ucks.  didn't have coffee of course. was home by 6.40 p.m. lontong... yummm.... =)  watched tv, fell asleep on the couch. had two good phone conversations after i woke up.

      On this day,   urlLink 46 years ago  , a plane made a third attempt to take off. On board: a young football team, fresh from a successful European Cup quarter final, their support staff and a few reporters. Some were never to play or watch another football game.  I've never seen most of that team play, save for old video clips of Bobby Charlton later in his playing career. I can only imagine how great a player Duncan Edwards was. And by all accounts, he was  THE  complete player. He was only 21 when he passed away fifteen days after the air crash. The Great Scot before Ferguson, Matt Busby, started from scratch and built a new team, one that would eventually win the European Cup almost a decade later.  By no means was this one of the worst disasters or tragedies in history. Nevertheless, for a Manchester United (there is only   one  United ) fan, this day reminds us that there are things more important than football - life itself - contrary to what some scouse manager of the past opined. And that we can rise from tragedies and setbacks. We did, and we always will.  May the players, staff and reporters who lost their lives on the slushy runway at Munich on 6 February 1958 rest in peace.

      I'm heartened to know there are Singaporeans who believe that money isn't everything. I hope that I never forget that... Of course, there are those also those who believe that money is progress, like the other letter-writer in today's forum page. And he quotes LKY too:  "My point to Mr Stefansson is that if one stops striving to achieve more, to be better than one is now, to set a higher target once the target is reached, one has stopped progressing.  Why do you think Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is exhorting Singapore not to rest on its laurels and stay at 30,000 feet? He thinks that Singapore can and should climb to 36,000 feet." - - PETER TEO BOON HAW  Exactly. WHY? Mr Teo, progress for the sake of progress, is why Singapore is the way it is today, a place with no respect for the past and no sense of the present. We are obssessed with better. We are obssessed with new. So much so that one of our  tabloids - more than a decade old - is called "The New Paper".  An apt name, come to think of it - one which describes Singaporean mentality. Building too small? Tear it down! Replace it with something bigger, something better, something new. Nevermind that the building is still in perfect working order. Nevermind that the building holds memories dear to Singaporeans. Nevermind that renovations were just carried out a few years ago. Why have pseudo-new when you can have a brand new, bigger, better building? Progress? Mr Teo, think hard about why Singaporeans are so depressed nowadays. I say it's because we've been told - no, ordered - that staying at 30,000 feet is not progress, Not good. Ironic that he quotes Ben Franklin saying, "Who is rich? Someone who realises he has enough."  Maybe we should realise that we have enough. We complain about not having things to do when the reality is that the weekend comes and we are too tired to do anything. Why? Progress. We have to, we must, climb to 36,000 feet... then 50,000 feet. And then we'll finally reach the outer limits of our atmosphere. Suddenly, we'll realise that we can't breathe and that we're about to - literally - burst.  Easy for a professional bum to say all this though... right? As I said at the start, I hope my belief that money is not everything holds even after I enter the working world.   urlLink Is chasing after money good or bad? - The Straits Times, Forum Page, FEB 5, 2004   (Start of copied text) ---------- I APPLAUD Mr Paul Stefansson for dispensing very wise advice at the start of a new year in his letter, 'Money, money, it's a rich man's woe' (ST, Jan 31).  After the momentous events of the past few years, one has to realise that, at the end of the day, there is more to life than chasing money.  While my peers and my husband's moved from Housing Board flats to condos, we remained in our HDB flat. While our friends moved on to own cars, we stuck with the efficient public-transport system.  We are living on a single income for the fourth year so that our son can have a full-time mum to look after him, and imbibe our values.  While we live simply, we have created opportunities for our child to see the world, to realise that there is so much more outside this island. There are flowers to pick, open fields to run in, birds to chase; on the other hand, there are also hungry people and not all children are playing, some are working.  At the end of the day, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really want?  SHIRLEY WOON LI LIN (MDM) ---------- (End of copied text)

      If you're a frequent visitor to my blog, you'll notice that I've made some changes. It all started with my 'ShoutOut' comments disappearing into thin-cyberspace. I replaced the comment system, then I started changing the colours... and one thing led to another.  I can't say that my blog is radically different, some of the stuff is 'under the hood'. For example, most of the fixed links open in new windows now. I've also decided to back up my blog, after seeing what has happened to other blogs. I've consolidated my blog entries from both my easyjournal and  urlLink  livejournal   into my  urlLink  blogspot  . I've backed up everything on livejournal. As you can see, my archive just got larger.  So, please bookmark  urlLink  http://acroamatical.blogspot.com/  . That'll be my main blog. The livejournal is purely for backup. And my easyjournal will continue to exist (but not updated) since it somehow gets visitors every month.  Also, this is not my only post today, there's an edition of singapore national education below, and a long entry on how to use your Identity Card for fun and profit.  Enjoy!

      Hohoho... Malaysia has  malaysiakini , we have  Mr Brown  (not the one from  Mind Your Language )!  Oh, before you read SNE Part 94, read   Lord of the Bengs: One Beng to Hoot Them All   for a quick laugh... =)   (Start of copied text) -----------    urlLink Singapore National Education Part 94    by  urlLink mr brown   Weeks of 9 Jan 2003 to 3 Feb 2004  (Feel free to distribute for non-profit and non-commercial purposes but keep my byline, email address and URL intact please. Thanks)  I have also learned lately:  1. That the latest economic tool used to measure how well a country's economy going to do is known as "The Feeling in The Prime Minister's Bones".  "'I can feel it it my bones that next year will be a better year,' (PM) Goh said, citing the turnaround in the US and Japanese economies, Singapore's main export markets and trading partners." -CNA  2. That Microsoft is complaining that Apple dominating the market. With their iPods.  "HP's move to release an own-branded digital-music player based on Apple's iPod -and to ship iTunes pre-installed on all HP PCs -has angered Microsoft.  General manager of Microsoft's Windows digital media division David Fester has suggested that iTunes' emerging dominance would be bad for consumers, because it would limit them to the iPod. " -  MacWorld Jan 12 2004   3. That Singapore cops seem to have a thing for getting um, oral testimonies, by underaged girls.  "Cop pleads guilty to having oral sex with wife's sister" -ST  4. That the Straits Times will now cost 70 cents for subscribers (up 10 cents, or 16.6%) and 80 cents off the newsstand (up 20 cents, or 33.3%). And you thought in these bad times, the GST was going to be the only thing to go up.  5. That SIA has raised their academic requirements for air stewardesses from minimum "O" Level to at least Diploma or "A" Level.  Maybe the budget arm can take the "O" Level ones.  6. That you will soon be assured of being served by SIA girls with Air Level (NSMen will understand this term better than most people).  7. That yet another economics professor has complained of lack of access to Singapore's labour statistics, held as top secret data by the Ministry of Manpower. Release of this data can lead to friction with neighbouring countries, loss of competitiveness, and general ill-feeling about the Government.  Hence, the need for secrecy.  8. That Mariah Carey will be allowed to perform in Malaysia, but she is to dress modestly, and lose the bikini tops and low-cut outfits. I mean, lose in the sense of wear something else, not go without clothing, of course.  9. That there is word that Mariah Carey may also have to deflate her breasts too, to ensure that no modesty laws are broken. If that is not possible, she will try very hard not to jiggle when she sings. She may even have wear a bra.  "No sexy clothes for Mariah, warn officials  KUALA LUMPUR - American pop diva Mariah Carey will hold her concert in Malaysia next month despite Islamic pressure for it to be cancelled but she cannot wear sexy or revealing attire, officials and organisers said yesterday." -ST Interactive 17 Jan 2004  10. That the Singapore Government is reviewing the baby incentives because despite the Baby Bonus Scheme, Singapore posted a 26-year low in child births for 2003.  Here is an incentive suggestion: how about some jobs, a lower cost of living, and a better economic situation?  "Govt reviewing baby bonus scheme  It is thinking of new ways to arrest low birth rate, says DPM Lee, adding that birth rate is one of top three priorities" -ST Jan 26, 2004  "It's not a new problem. To encourage people, we have incentives, we have tax rebates, we have all sorts of things, but still the number of babies has been going down." - DPM LHL  11. That you can now buy your own US politician at  Amazon  with just 1-Click.   mrbrown screen grab   12. That New Zealand, with a population about the same size as Singapore (not counting the sheep), produced a movie trilogy that is on its way to becoming a classic. The Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, has won a Golden Globe for best drama and best director.  But of course, Singapore had SARS, which is why we did not fare as well. In other words, Singapore was on MC.  Besides, we have Chicken Rice Wars, I Not Stupid, and of course, One Leg Kicking.  13. That NMP does not stand for No More Porn or Nublie Maid Photos.  14. That, according to the Government, I need to be a monkey this year to aid in Singapore's recovery.  We are so glad we do not pay our millioniare ministers peanuts, or we will get monkeys.  "Singaporeans could foster an economic recovery this year by behaving more like monkeys, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said in a Lunar New Year message reported in The Straits Times newspaper.  'Be like a monkey. When things happen, you have to be nimble. Take advantage of opportunities, don't be cast down, but rise to the challenge if it does occur,' Tan was quoted as saying."  15. That Singapore is now a nation of happy workers, according to a local survey.  Yes, locals are all feeling love and joy over their jobs, even those without jobs. SARS, Bird Flu, loss of competitiveness can never overwhelm the Happy Worker Monkeys of Singapore!  That may explain why they so happily swallow every policy that the Government throws their way, like cutting CPF, higher GST, and making more and more of their pay variable.  "S'pore: nation of happy workers?  You may hear it in the office, on the train or bus, among friends at lunch - an apparently never-ending gripe about work.  But surprise, surprise, 59 per cent of Singapore workers say they love their jobs and 25 per cent of them want to stay in them for 15 years or more.  This despite a year of merciless lay-offs and painful wage cuts." -ST  16. That Thailand must have some bad-ass, mean motherf****r chickens in their country. Some 400 soldiers and 100 prisoners have been deployed to kill chickens suspected of spreading the bird flu.  It may be made into a Hollywood movie soon, "Predator 3: The Chickens Arrive".  Personally, I think you just need one soldier and a very big cage. And maybe a flame-thrower.  17. That the 400 soldiers deployed to kill the mutant chickens of Thailand are part of a secret unit known as the 35th Chiang Mai Combat Battalion, Free Rangers.  Better known as the "Chiang Mai Chicken Commandos", these fine, elite troops have been trained to kill a chicken in 119 ways.  18. That KFC is planning to serve fish in the light of the Bird Flu scare. I don't know, taste the Colonel's fine fish cooked in 11 herbs and spices at Kentucky Fried Cod just doesn't sound quite right.  18. That Singapore may make a sequel to the Chicken Rice Wars but it will be an action movie to make it more commercially viable than the first one.  Filmed entirely in Thailand, Chicken Rice Wars 2: Operation Hatyai will feature the 400 elite Chiang Mai Chicken Commandos of Thailand. Some 14,000 chickens will be harmed in the filming of this movie.  Most of the chickens used will not be CGI-based, and many chickens will be doing their own stunts, including being torched, sprayed with bullets, and having their throats cut. Some will even be eaten.  There will be a love story amidst this carnage, of course, with Lum May Yee acting as Geng-ri, the daughter of a chicken farmer torn between saving her family farm and helping a handsome Chicken Commando Lieutenant Pak Cham-Gai, played by MTV VJ Utt, to eliminate the Bird Flu menace.  Actress Christy Chung is rumoured to be doing a cameo in this movie, in a steamy but artfully tasteful sex scene involving a confused young man and some randy chickens.  19. That a Citycab taxi drove into the swimming pool of condominium Kentish Lodge, because it was raining heavily and the pool was near the condo entrance, masquerading as a puddle of water. The taxi driver escaped unharmed, but the taxi remained in the pool until compensation issues were finalised between Citycab and the condo MC.  Concerned Singaporeans followed the saga intently, and bought 4D with the number 3277.  So if you call a cab, and it waits for you in your swimming pool, is there an extra charge?  20. That you know technology has failed to reach the older generation when you are teaching your mom how to access the SMS menu, and you tell her to click on the joystick, then shift to the Envelope icon... and she shakes the phone to make the "shift".  21. That a dead sperm whale being transported through the streets of Taipei on the back of a trailer-truck spilled its guts onto the fair city streets.  Looking at the picture of the large uncovered dead mammal strapped on the truck, you wonder, haven't these guys heard of cling wrap or even canvas?  I guess this Willy did not have the stomach for land travel...  "A dead sperm whale being transported through Tainan City on its way to a research station suddenly exploded yesterday, splattering cars and shops with blood and guts.  Certified by authorities as the largest beached whale on record in Taiwan, the 17-meter 50-ton carcass was being transported by a flat-bed trailer-truck to a special research location after National Cheng Kung University officials and security guards refused to allow the whale on campus....  Local news reports showed a number of people who had gathered to take photographs of the whale before it exploded in Tainan City, as well as residents and shop owners following the explosion. Many were wearing gauze-masks and trying to clean up the spilled blood and the entrails with brushes and brooms.  'What a stinking mess! This blood and other stuff that blew out on the road is disgusting, and the smell is really awful,' said one resident.  The news also showed one section of the street along with several parked automobiles and pedestrian walkways covered in red with copious amounts of splattered whale blood.  Lying on the trailer-truck was the dead whale - underbelly exposed with a large elongated tear where the biological gaseous blowout took place. Besides the shocking red bloody mess, large piles of whale intestines and guts were strewn along the road, leaving an unpleasant and ghastly scene for startled residents." -etaiwannews.com  22. That after six years of hard work, mrbrown.com has made it to the Ministry of Education's internet blacklist. Check out the MOE Access Denied firewall message here:   http://www.mrbrown.com/banned.html   I can totally understand why the Education ministry considers the personal website of a guy who posts his rants and his baby photos a threat to the very moral fibre of our youth and society.  23. That Microsoft wants us to take the technological leap forward by TYPING our URLs instead of clicking on links. This is because of security vulnerablities in their wonderful Explorer browser that allow fun things like spoofed URLs.  "The most effective step that you can take to help protect yourself from malicious hyperlinks is not to click them. Rather, type the URL of your intended destination in the address bar yourself. By manually typing the URL in the address bar, you can verify the information that Internet Explorer uses to access the destination Web site. To do so, type the URL in the Address bar, and then press ENTER." -Microsoft Support  Makes you wish you were using Mozilla or Apple's Safari, doesn't it?   http://netsquirrel.com/spoof/    http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=16700218   http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/36402 (Kenneth's note: this link brings up an anti-virus warning from McAfee VirusScan.)  24. That a Government task force (they certainly love their task forces, don't they?) have come up with a guide to help companies weather bad times by making more of an employee's pay variable. The variable component will be linked to the employee's and the company's performance. The Government plans to "persuade" companies to roll this out by the end of 2004.  The fixed-to-variable ratio for regular employees is set at 70:30, middle managers are 60:40 and senior management 50:50.  In other words, the government has now given companies a new way for companies to cut your pay. I guess that Annual Wage Supplement (AWS), a.k.a. the 13th Month Bonus, was not variable enough.  So if our millionaire ministers are the senior management of the country, will their salaries be variable too? Maybe we can peg 50% their salaries to things like level of employment, annual growth, the ST Index, opinion polls, number of GRC walkovers, and the price of COEs.  "Task force issues guide to flexi-wages  The aim: to move towards pay packets that are 70% fixed, 30% variable, giving employers room to act fast in bad times" -ST  25. That when your laptop starts displaying multiple copies of your hard disk and your hard disk is named "uop9568u0u9228i", it may be time to move it to a spot your toddler cannot reach.

      My phone started buzzing at 8.30 a.m. Snooze...  8.40 a.m. Snooze...  8.50 a.m. Snooze...  9.00 a.m. Snooze...  It seemed like I would never get out of bed, but I had to. After all, I didn't want to be hunted down by Military Police.  My 'crime'? I forgot to return my Exit Permit to immigration when I returned to Singapore. So, CMPB sent me a heartwarming letter about how Singapore and the SAF misses me, and how they'd like to get their piece of paper back.  Complete with specific timing: between 9.30 a.m. and noon.  CMPB has beefed up its security measures by several levels since my last visit (when that was, I can't recall). There was the 'checkpoint'. "IC, please." After duly acknowledging that I am a Singaporean, I was waved through. My backpack went uninspected, which really surprised me. I mean, Singaporeans are all automatically loyal? Can't some disgruntled Singaporean turn his back on his home and decide to do something nasty?  Am I (potentially) more dangerous than the (uninspected) contents of my bag? Anyway, another round of "IC, please," at the entrance of CMPB. Scanned into a laptop, along with my contact details. Hmmm... let's say I do decide to do something. Are they going to CALL ME UP after the fact? The people up there thinking up of 'security measures' are brilliant! I mean, sure I'm going to give you my REAL CONTACT DETAILS if I'm intending to do something clandestine. Directed to the reception desk, next to the table where the laptop was. "What are you here for?" Well, let's see... something about returning my exit permit. "Show me the letter and your IC, please." Strange, this fetish for my Identity Card. It's so popular, I almost wanted to have a look myself, just to see what was so attractive about it. Anyway, like I'm going to take a joyride all the way to Depot Road just to test the integrity of CMPB's 'security measures'.  I got my ticket number and took a seat. After my number was called, I was lead by an innocuous looking woman - don't judge a book by its cover - to an interview room. *gulp* This time, she wanted my passport too...  Okay, Singapore has an integrated database - let's not pretend that this does not exist - and the Army can EASILY check with Singapore Immigration and Registration (errr... at least that's what I recall it's called, but the appropriate-sounding acronym is SIR a.k.a. Bi. .......) So, let's play twenty questions (ok, not quite):  Did you bring your passport? (Honest mistake, it was listed in the letter, but all I remembered was the piece of paper they wanted.) Did you know that you are supposed to return the Exit Permit once you have permanently returned to Singapore? Have you made any overseas trips since then?  I think I answered everything to satisfaction. My interviewer left me alone for a while. When she came back, she said her officer said it was okay, that would not need to see my passport. (Of course! Because it's on record in some database that the Army can access!) Gave me a brochure regarding overseas trips and what not.  It's funny how they can be so thorough with these things, but never seemed to know that I WAS NOT IN SINGAPORE during my first year in Melbourne. For a long time, the Army kept on sending me recall notices and what not. Inform both my unit and CMPB... several times. CMPB says unit's problem. Unit says CMPB's problem. I say, SAF's problem, not mine.  Hahaha... didn't mean to go on a rampage. Sometimes, I just wish I had signed on. I'd have less of a problem if I didn't have to make to constant transition between civillian and military.  Next stop: National University of Singapore. This time, no IC needed. I just dropped off a job application and left.  Went to ComCentre in the city because the only way to disconnect your mobile phone service (at least for SingTel) is to physically be present so that they can verify your identity...  "IC, please."  I think my IC has had a field day after being dormant in my wallet for so long, save for curious people who looked at it in Melbourne. Oh, there was no other place that I could go to disconnect my line. They have mobile phone shops in every nook and cranny, but only one (or two actually, I was told the other SingTel place 'near' where I live is in Hougang) place I could go to terminate it. To think that I terminated all my utilities over the phone in Melbourne.  Then again, Telstra billed me for early termination of my internet account. Which was not the case. But that's another story, which has already been resolved.  Communications providers, can't live with them, can't live without them.  One more stop: OCBC, to cancel my debit card and savings account. I don't have much in it, and it always goes into overdraft because they charge service fees. I thought I put in enough to cover the last overdraft, but it cost me $4.99 (exactly) I gave ten dollars, and they returned me $5.01... like the one cent is going to make a difference after all the ODs they've been charging me interest on. For once, I was (kind of) glad they asked for my IC. I had no idea what my account number was but the all-singing, all-dancing IC did the trick. They had all my records.  Adrian Loo's dad said that the Malaysian IC holds everything the Malaysian authorities know about you, and his friend working in a govt department proved it, listing various things that there was no way he could know. All he asked was for Adrian's dad's IC number. Well, it's probably the same in Singapore. Haven't I said so many times that Singaporeans and Malaysians, and our governments, have more in common than we have differences? Well, like poles repel... I guess magnetism and foreign relations have something to trade stories about.  That was my last stop. Oh, one more complaint. The photo shop is taking FOUR WORKING DAYS to print my digital shots. For goodness sake, get with the times. Penalising me for not using film is only going to drive me to buy a good printer and print stuff on my own. Or find a shop that will do it faster. So, you can't sell film anymore, big deal. Sell memory cards! Wait... they already do that. They do film in ONE DAY. Mind you, the film has to be processed, then they can print. I really don't see why digital photos take four days. But I left my memory card with them, so I'll just leave it be. Never going there to print digital shots. How I miss Vanbar...  Okay, enough complaints. As you can tell, all that tired me out. And if you've reached this point of this entry, congrats! Just a little more to go...  No more complaints, ok? I've really reverted to my true nature as a Singaporean. All I need to do now, is line up in a queue for something cheap, and the transformation will be complete... =P  Had to take an afternoon nap after all my exertion. I met Adrian Mak and Lester for dinner. Started at 7, ended past midnite. Haven't chatted that deeply with two guys for a long time. Haven't chatted with Adrian and Lester for a long time too. We've grown, though memories of days gone by were still in our minds, and alluded to once in a while. The conversation centred on God, Catholicism, Faith and Religion. It was all well and good... inspiring, provoking and affirming...  If only I can practice all of what I purport to say... I'm weak. Help me, God.

      Some time last year, I volunteered to help out in the   Standard Chartered Rugby Sevens Singapore  .  I filled in a form on the website, sent it off and promptly forgot about it. After all, I'd also volunteered to help in the Rugby World Cup, but I didn't make it past the interview.  I definitely wanted to watch the Sevens tournament but my current state of employment didn't allow me to get a Gallery ticket, let alone a Grandstand one. I'd resigned myself to watching coverage on TV, if there was any. Then, an email came: I had been selected to be a volunteer!  The briefing was on Saturday afternoon. The Operations Director, Yazed, briefed the volunteers. Filled in an accreditation form and Yazed told me that I was going to be in the Entertainment group. In his introduction, he mentioned the Sevens as a world-class tournament. He also highlighted that it was going to be a huge, fun event.  I've never had any doubts about that. And apologies to Football. The National Stadium is already being prepared for the tournament, so there's no way a football match would be staged there a few days before the Sevens. Anyway, Yazed then pointed out that...  In 2002, during the first Singapore Sevens, a tall young man called Joe Rokocoko blizted defences and he was promptly given his break in Super 12 and subsequently the All Blacks. The point being that Sevens was where future stars are - if not born - made.  Cool little fact #2: More than 100 people applied to be volunteers but about 20 were chosen. (More 'volunteers' will run the show. These 'volunteers' are staff from the Singapore Sports Council.) Basis of consideration: Age and previous volunteering experience, particularly in sports events. When Yazed mentioned previous experience, my mind jumped back to my failed attempt at volunteering for the RWC. My mind also made an oblique reference to my lack of experience hampering my job applications. Which is another story entirely...  Anyway, I was glad that they chose me. The benefits were pretty good too. Two adidas Climalite tee-shirts with the tournament logo (one for each day of the tournament, probably worth $40 each if they were sold in stores), a pair of adult gallery tickets (already distributed to Lena), $20 per day (a.k.a. transport money), breakfast, lunch and dinner for both days, cert of appreciation and most of all, the experience of helping out in a major sports event. Probably photo ops too... but won't be bringing my dSLR and won't let photo taking come in the way of my job.  I've to attend one more briefing by the Entertainment Head of Department some time in the coming week, so I'm not sure if I'll be working the whole day on both days. Some of the other jobs are in shifts. I hope mine is too. Then, I can get to watch some fabulous, fast and furious rugby. Can almost imagine the atmosphere and the colour. Ahhh... fond memories of the RWC. What's more, my staff pass will get me almost anywhere in the stadium, including the players' rest area AND the Saturday evening party! =)  To top off all these cool things, I was informed during the briefing, that a surprise was in store for the spectators. There'd be intervals between the games, and plenty of entertainment lined up (this is presumably where I come in, but I'm not going to be dressed up in a clown suit or asked to juggle or anything).  The surprise entertainment is a famous rock band. Apparently, it's so secret, I'm not allowed to say which band this is. And my job, apparently, involves escorting these people. Let's just say that I'm not a crazy, or even a big fan of this band. But I do like a few of their songs. I know plenty of people who would really like to be in my shoes! Hopefully, they are not a tribute band, as one of the other volunteers conjectured after the briefing. I'm just hoping that they are good to work with, won't turn up drunk, and get on stage when they have to with a minimum of fuss. They are a famous rock band, after all, and I'm sure they have famous rock band behaviour. Or they could turn out to be really nice people!  I'm surprised the Singapore Rugby Union managed to get them. It's some coup. For a long time, this band would not have been able to play in Singapore - long hair and coarse language. Now, they will be playing at the Sevens. Not rugby, of course. Guitars! Drums! Perhaps a piano... They don't exactly fit in with my conception of rugby. Unless you consider they are pitching the fun and carnival aspect of this tournament.  Hmmm... I think I might have given away the secret. ;P All you Singaporeans out there, stop complaining there's nothing to do in Singapore. On 3rd and 4th April, there will be plenty at the National Stadium!     Join the fun at the Sevens! No rugby knowledge required!   ----------  After the briefing, I went to Ja's place for a BBQ. Had an excellent time. My phone buzzed, reminding me to call a man who had inquired about COSDU on his daughter's behalf. I can't remember the exact words of the phone conversation, but I think my email to him explains the phone call somewhat. It's sad to find that people think this way.    Hi Joachim,  Before I continue, I must say what's been on my mind since our phone call.  Although I am glad that you are trying to find a faith community for your daughter in Melbourne, I am slightly taken aback at your reasons for doing so.  First, I am puzzled by your insistence on contacting a religious person. Lay people make up the majority of out faith and any leadership that a lay person provides is both a welcome service and a God-given blessing. If anything, more lay people should be taking responsibility for our faith, especially in these times of declining religious vocations. Maria Lydia is a wonderful person and president of the Catholic Overseas Students Down Under (COSDU). I find it a slight on her abilities as a leader and her qualities as a person that you seem to think (at least as I perceive it) her being a student somehow detracts from her position. COSDU is affiliated with the University of Melbourne and is thus a fully student-run Catholic community (i.e. the President and Committee of COSDU will always comprise of Uni students).  Let me reassure you that Sr. Theresa Ryan FMDM, as International Chaplain of the University of Melbourne, provides excellent spiritual guidance and support to COSDU, its committee and anyone who steps into her office - Catholic or non-Catholic, and even the occasional Australian. Likewise, COSDU opens its doors to everyone - student or worker, Melbourne Uni student or not. The bottom line is that COSDU is truly Catholic, in faith and in deed. This leads me to my second puzzlement.  Catholic means 'universal'. We are taught to love our enemies. We try to be inclusive, not exclusive. I can understand a parent wanting his/her child to have a community that he/she can belong to, especially when far away from home. In fact, COSDU's mission statement is "A Family Away From Home, Growing Together in Christ". We strive to be that family away from home. And that means accepting everyone. Everyone, after all, deserves a family.  I detect a sense of fear you have that your daughter might get into bad company or stray from the faith by mixing with Australians. (Of course, I might have totally misunderstood what you were saying. In which case, I sincerely apologise right now.) However, I believe that bad company comes in all shapes, sizes and forms. And people stray from the faith for numerous reasons. Blaming it on the foreign environment and foreigners, in particular, is futile and fallacious. Bad company can even come in the form of another Singaporean! One can lose faith without travelling overseas.  There is nothing to fear about the average Australian. At the end of the day, it's quite difficult avoiding Australians while in Australia. I put it to you that it doesn't matter which country we come from. From a Catholic perspective, a mass is recognisable anywhere in the world. That unites every Catholic worldwide. That's one of the beauties of our faith. Similarly,from a macro viewpoint, everyone in the world is human. Our common humanity should unite, not divide.  Having said all this, I am not discouraging you from telling your daughter about COSDU. Far from it, I would really encourage her to join COSDU. The people in COSDU are diverse, coming from many nations and from all walks of life. More importantly, the people in COSDU are truly loving, giving and caring. So many people have touched my life while I was in Melbourne. I'm really thankful God led me to them.  I have to apologise if my words are harsh. I felt I had to say what was on my mind. All this is merely my point of view. I expect that you might think of all this as me being impertinent and that this email is not valid as there is no "authority" behind it. Think of me what you will, but please do not let the spirit of this email go unheeded. I know what it is like to be overseas and alone in faith, and I do not wish that experience on others. And I truly admire and respect you for being concerned about your daughter's spiritual development and well-being.  Please find out more about COSDU at this website:   http://cosdu-.port5.com/   Sr. Theresa Ryan can be contacted at +61(*) **** ****. Her e-mail address is t****@*******.***.au Maria Lydia can be contacted at +61(*) **** ****. Her e-mail address is m**********@*****.com  Yours in Christ, Kenneth 8)  --- end of copied text ---->  P.S.    Happy Birthday Mary-Ann, Joseph and Lena!

      It's been a while. Apologies to those who visit, expecting an update on my life and times. It would be fallacy to say that nothing is happening in my life. In fact, for the first time in a long while, I stepped out of the house for four consecutive days. The streak has come to an end though. Spent the whole of today at home, doing an uncompleted job.  That I will be paid for. Unfortunately, the photos didn't turn out very well, so I've plenty of colour correction to do. (That's what I did today.) Anyway, I spent Friday afternoon taking photos. Saturday, I went to the city to send to photos for developing and printing. Also popped by the career fair. Bumped into Trees at Suntec and had coffee with her. Then went for mass, followed by a meeting with the people of the "mustard seed". It's a bi-monthly newsletter for the youths in Risen Christ. I'll be helping out in an advisory capacity. Sunday... watched England lose to Ireland. Watched Ferrari race off into the distance. Had coffee with Lena. Monday evening, I watched Big Fish with Ee and Ruth. Bumped into France 98 and Leo.  I typed this email last night, meant for the COSDUans in Singapore, but I figured I might as well share it with everyone. And you if have the time, please read this article:   What Should I Do With My Life?    ----------  With regards to Gerry's question about "how your job hunt is coming along?", Adrian's latest blog   entry   and Dennis' recent email...  Well, the job hunt is not going well. Of course, this takes it's toll, and like Adrian, I've had no offers. Unlike Adrian, I've not had a single interview yet. My parents are supportive.  Let me restate that. My dad isn't saying anything. Which is normal for my dad. He doesn't say much, as those of you who have met him can attest. BUT this is a good thing, I suppose. Better than him bugging me about not being able, or worse, not trying hard enough, to find a job. And this, in some measure, is my dad being supportive.  My mum contantly looks in the papers for me, and gently prods me to try to apply, even though the advertisement asks for a Masters degree holder with 10 years work experience who is trilingual can work long and irregular hours and possibly even weekends. At the end of the day, she doesn't make me feel bad about being at home or not having a job. This is, of course, the woman who famously advised me to "follow my heart" when I was offered an editing job just before leaving for Melbourne. My mum's the greatest.  Okay, I exaggerated about the job ads. But it might as well be that way. Truth be told, I don't think I'm trying hard enough. Probably because I cannot say exactly what I want to do.  But this thought keeps on coming back to me: be a photographer.  After all, I've stated many times that I don't want to go to work in a long-sleeved shirt and pants. Maybe I should just turn up in a shirt... =P Hahaha, no, I'm kidding. Basically, office attire is not suited to our climate. Actually, it's the other way around but no one is going to start turning this place into Hawaii, where you can hold an executive position and turn up in a decent polo t-shirt and slacks from Monday to Thursday, and even less on Friday.  And if there's anything my Uni and poly life has taught me, it's that I work in bursts. Intense bursts followed by periods of rest equal or more than the time/effort I put into my work. Surely no office job will allow me this freedom or flexibility and grant me half the week off.  Like Dennis wrote, and from observing my friends, yes, I agree. Most people are too busy making money to enjoy life... nay, to HAVE a life. Just today, one of my poly friends I bumped into (NIE final semester, currently doing practicum) said, "I need to get a life". Indeed.  This, I'm "too busy to do anything" attitude (or predicament, 'cos some people honestly don't mean to get themselves into this work-eat-sleep bind) is the reason that there is nothing to do in Singapore. I keep on suggesting things to do. (Shamelss plug: join me for the   football match  !) But no one is free. Or they are too tired. Easier to get pissed drunk, eh Dennis?  I don't want to be like that. I want to do things. I want to keep up with my friends. I want to keep on following my sports - to the extent that I can up and leave to follow a tournament or a game overseas. I want to wear what I want to work, decide who I want to work with and when I want to rest. I want to be invovled in church.  It's funny, to think about it. I'd never have seriously contemplated being a full-time photographer if I hadn't gone to Melbourne. Melbourne gave me the opportunity to develop my skills. More importantly, it fanned (if there is such a word... and no pun intended, Adrian) the spark of a hobby into a flame of passion. Of course, it won't be easy to start off, or even to sustain. First, I'll have to get equipment ($5000 estimated worth and climbing - dSLR, memory card, lenses, filters, battery pack, cable release etc. etc.), then spend more money doing up a proper portfolio, website, name card...  and a stable income is never ever assured.  I've always been risk averse. Going to poly after army was risk-free. Going to Uni was also another risk-free decision. Actually, going to JC instead of poly in the first place was supposed to be a risk-free move too. Typically Singaporean. (Side note: my brother just farted in his sleep, the air-con is on and the door is closed.) I think it's in my blood. My parents were civil servants at different times in their lives, I have uncles on both sides of the family in the military, and one former policeman. And I have, even in my job applications, been risk averse. The most recent application I sent was for a... you guessed it... a job in the civil service (Ministry of Home Affairs - Home Affairs Senior Executive or HASE, pronounced 'haze' apparently). I'm eminently qualified for the job. No doubt, Singaporean friends and family would eye me approvingly if I manage to get the job. Still... perhaps it's time to take a risk. For a career, for my livelihood, for my sanity, for my happiness...  Dear God. What say you?

      Ruth started with an entry on the most depressing song she knows:  Mad World  by Gary Jules (actually, by Tears for Fears... it's a remake). I heard the Gary Jules version while watching Donnie Darko. The movie and the song go hand in hand. Qinyi goes for  Gloomy Sunday .  But this is my pick. It's not outright depressing. In fact, it's funny/charming/happy/sad/tragic/sweet all at the same time. The wonders of irony, of juxtaposition. And the music that goes with the lyrics... if you don't pay attention to the words, you'd think that this is the happiest tune in the world! Which makes this song even more tragic. You really have to listen to the song to get the full effect... (no... i never said to go download it... ;P )   Me and You versus The World   Written By Scott/Griffiths and Space  I first met you hanging knickers on the line. From that moment on. I knew that there could only be one outcome. Me and you against the world forever. You had no folks and I'm just a joke. But we made a vow. That we would never sell each other out. A lie detector wouldn't make me doubt you.  Now we know that it's us versus the world now. Me and you against the world now. Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us. Hey now, me and you against the world now Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us  We hitched a ride that would turn out suicide I had my '45 replica gun. I didn't think we'd ever need it. Didn't know he had a real one loaded. You went in first, took the worst. Couldn't hear me shouting you. To stop above the busy traffic passing by We promised that together we would die.  Now we know that it's us versus the world now. Me and you against the world now. Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us. Hey now, me and you against the world now Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us.  I went in next Took a bullet in the chest. So I hit him with the only thing that was anywhere near me. A tin of baked beans and a woman's weekly. I grabbed the cash Picked you up and made a dash. Didn't get too far Made it to the parking lot. 40 cops in front of us. Guess who got shot...  Lying there dying in each others arms. Oh you said to me. Don't worry about a thing my little sweetheart. We're together we shall never be apart. You took a chance on a loser like me. But you never let me down. And whether we're in Heaven or Hell I know it's better than separate cells.  Now we know that it's us versus the world now. Me and you against the world now. Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us. Hey now, me and you against the world now Look up there in the sky now. See those stars well they're shining just for us.

      been going through all my photos to see what i can use in my portfolio. i've almost forgotten some people, places and events in the photos. yet some others are permanently etched in my mind - no need for photos. it's quite a task on one level, just ploughing through all them. for example, i have  27 rolls  just from the yep expedition to hainan. on another level, it's an emotional rollercoaster - people, places and events that bring a smile, a tear or both. and it's not just the image depicted in the photo. i remember what i was feeling when i took the photo, what i was thinking, who i showed it to and when - the whole context that surrounds the photos' conception, creation and display. i even remember photo opportunities that i never captured on film. times when i was too slow to encapsulate the moment or or when the weather was just too horrible or when i just thought it best to leave it as a memory.

      read this on  urlLink  offstone   and found it interesting...  it's instructional, inspirational, comforting and humbling all at once.     5 Basic Photography Principles   1. Photographers are not primarily interested in photographs. They have a focused energy and enthusiasm which is directed at an outside, physically present, other. They bring to this subject an exaggerated sense of curiosity, backed up by knowledge gleaned from reading, writing, talking, note taking.  2. The photographer transmits this passion in "the other itself" by making pictures, therefore the subject must lend itself to a visual medium, as opposed to, say, writing about it.  3. The photographer must assiduously practice his/her craft so that there is no technical impediment bewteen realizing the idea and transmitting it through the final print.  4. The photographer must have the ability to analyze the components of the subject-idea so that a set of images not only reflects the basic categories but also displays visual variety. Intense, clear thinking is a prerequisite to fine photography.  5. The photographer is aware that, like all difficult endeavors, to be good at photography requires an unusual capacity for continuous hardwork and..........  Good Luck!

      i've been ill most of the past week and also busy with photography, so i haven't had time to write in my blog. actually, i probably did have the time but wasn't in the mood to write.  despite being ill, it was a good week. i managed to meet up with joy and felicia, who were back in singapore during the easter break. the conversations and company was terrific. =)  i was fortunate to get a job covering an event during the easter weekend. i took a kilo of shots - literally almost a thousand in just a day and a half. it was no joke colour correcting and tweaking the photos... especially when i was down with a sore throat, cold and cough. and headache.  i've also been trying to learn more about portrait photography (indoor and outdoor) and getting practice almost every weekend. i almost managed to get a product shoot job for a major store thro' the event last week. that would have helped alleviate my almost perpetual empty pocket situation. i'm not overly disappointed that i didn't get it; it was great knowing that i was considered!   since switching to digital, i have not been very pleased with my photos whether personal or commissioned. there was something about my photos in late 2001 and 2002 that really made them shine. perhaps i was improving through sheer effort - i did return home with more than 1000 photos that year. perhaps it was the people i was with. i thought switching to a consumer digital camera was what lowered my standards in 2003. partly, yes but switching back to SLR (albeit digital) this year hasn't resulted in the return of that 'pop' in my photos.  whatever the case, i need more practice. practice makes perfect, and while there is no perfection in photography, there is always room to develop.  hmmm, a lot of 'i's in this entry somehow... anyway, here are some outdoor portraits from a morning shoot on good friday... it's been a long time since i put my  pinto photos watermark on my work!  ( urlLink  serena 01  ) serena is a model with a glowing smile. she's very bubbly and it isn't hard to take a good photo of her.  ( urlLink  serena 02  ) the original photo for this one had a very warm tone, with serena's face bathed in red. the wall was originally red too. in order to get her skin tones down to acceptable levels, the rest of the photo had to be washed out. this was the best i could do but i like the end result. the washed out colours gives a dream-like feel to the photo, complementing serena's look. and of course, you can see her reflection in the door. my favvourite of the lot.  ( urlLink  serena 03  ) i like how the walkway converges, 'leading' to serena's face. did a bit of tweaking 'cos her face was slightly underexposed.  ( urlLink  leen 01  ) leen is great at the "don't mess with me" look. like serena's second photo, leen's face was awash in red. someone commented that i made her face too yellow, giving her a jaundiced look. it looks fine to me on my monitor though. and i like the contrast between the blue wall and her skin tone. her hair is a bit messy, but the ruffled look give interest to the photo. composition wise, i can do a tighter crop with her face more on the left of the photo.  ( urlLink  leen 02  ) the weakest photo of the lot. not much to say.  ( urlLink  leen 03  ) once again, i could have cropped this better. *gasp* no, she's not naked...

      a poem i read on a forum i frequent:      "False Dawn"     `merdeka’, they said, pointed the way for all  to a new dawn of a better life and a rosy future.  on this all the party manifestoes concurred,   only on the road to be taken they differed --  for the anglicised-democrats, consult and negotiate;  the socialists planned mass grievances to agitate.     their mandate the people eventually gave  the party that promised their cause to fight,  and jobs, food and shelter all to provide.  the ‘Always for the People Party’ pledged  a more just and equal society to build,  regardless of race, language or religion.     so over three decades and more,  the people stuck true to their bargain,  voting in their Party to power.  they ne’er thought the ‘people’s champion’  would renege on the promises to them  whose backs he had used to climb to power.     then the people lost the rights they had  when they weren’t yet a people free - -  the right to speak up and be heard,  the right to gather and to ‘agitate’,  the right to vote as the conscience dictate - -  the rights and dignity of ‘a people free’.     they soon realized they’d been sold  on promises never meant to be - -  a greater sharing of the common wealth,  the fruit of the people’s sweat and tears - -  they’d never to meritocracy subscribed,  meritocracy fronting paradise for an elite-few.      deprived the freedom to think,  they think no longer and so lose,  the spirit of spontaneity and enterprise.  as globalization begins its toll to take,  the people slogged more for less, then told  citizenship assures them not a livelihood.     one people, one nation forevermore,  only in fulness of time to know nationhood  confers not on nation-building pioneers,  any greater claims to privileges or rights  than those freely gifted away to quitters  who’ve come from some foreign shores.     which mother knows not  the children of her loins?  what shepherd heeds not  the bleating of his flock?  what nation worth the name  cares not for her very own?     and what great champion of the people  their needs and dignity he trivializes?  the people no longer need to wait,  the time is now their lot to remake.  just make certain at the end of the day,  the people’s dream has come to stay.     tragic would it be for the people to find,  at the end of the re-making nation process,  many roads they could choose to travel on,   only that none of these could they choose   would lead them to a destination  they could truly call home.

       aka the new zealand sevens team trains at the padang   I woke up this morning and read in the ST that New Zealand gave a rugby clinic to kids at the Padang and that England trained there too. No times were specified, so I wondered if I should just try my luck at the Padang today. I figured, if neither of the teams were there, there might be a chance some of the other teams might use the pitch.  When I got to the Padang, it was empty. Anyway, it was superb weather - haven't seen a decent blue sky in Singapore for a while. So, I started snapping the CBD skyline, with the Singapore Cricket Club in the foreground. I spent quite a few minutes fiddling with my camera and lenses. When I turned around...  A team clad in blue and white adidas jerseys were at the bleachers, warming up. Samoa? A closer look... spotted Eric Rush: NEW ZEALAND! Happily snapped away for the next hour or so. =)  And no, this is not an April Fool's joke...  Here you go!        ready for sprints       smile when you pass the ball       taking drills seriously       scrums and bums       warming up       the fellowship discussed how to take on mount swissotel       pass it to me!       help me search for my contacts...       what are YOU looking at?       bro, you've taken this male bonding thing a little too far...       to pass or not to pass?       cooling off       yes, coach       what's a little singaporean humidity to a kiwi?

      i recently completed reading  forrest gump  by winston groom. can't believe that it's been about ten years since the movie came out. it's still on my all-time favourites list. i knew the book was different - forrest becomes an astronaut and a chess champion among other deviations - but he is different character-wise as well.  right off, i noticed that book forrest was more bawdy than film forrest. while he still retains a certain naivete about the ways of the world, he also seems to screw up royally, especially with respect to Jenny. in the book, she leaves because forrest gets caught up with his fame as a professional wrestler. after the many twists and turns their relationship take, she gets married to someone else.  everything else is more or less tied up with forrest's booming shrimping business (no great storm resulting in a monopoly here... he learnt how to set up a shrimp farm while in vietnam). characters from throughout the book come under his employ.  where jenny is concerned, he finally finds her again. and there's a forrest jr. just as in the movie. but she's married to another man. ok, the book isn't a fairy tale. despite jenny dying in the movie, the fact is, forrest and her got married. that was one of the most powerful things about the movie... that love lasts over time and space and that there is - to an extent - a happily ever after.  i dunno, the book's ending just didn't click with me. if jenny's marriage to another person was groom's dose of reality for the story, then he should have just left the jenny thread alone after the final time forrest and jenny part. the people who wrote the screenplay did a wonderful job of turning the book into the film. they retained the most suitable storylines, fleshed out the characters and made the forrest and jenny love story really click.  i had to stifle tears when forrest was at jenny's grave in the film. the book left me bereft of any feeling for forrest or jenny.

      this time a decade ago i think we still knew each other at the opposite ends of church you in the choir loft me at the sanctuary  sometime, somehow we found out that the other person wasn't as bad as everyone else had made us out to be strange how things happen  i've had more best friends than girlfriends and you've outlasted them all not that i would want you to be my girlfriend that position has already been filled and even if it wasn't... nah!  (think ja will have something to say about that too)  thanks for being there for me when i received my As, when i broke up with serene and you know more than most how long it really took  for me to recover  i also remember all the drinks that we've had okay, maybe not all but the saturday nights at victoria bar when we would talk and drink and dream of the future...  but now, the past remember the aircraft carrier and how we 'forged' our tickets? remember our new year's outing arranged on the phone as we counted down? remember blasting 'brimful of asha' on repeat when i visited? remember when england won the rugby world cup?  i was looking at photos of us the other day where did those slim young men go? full of idealism, enthusiasm and alcoholism or so everyone said we've grown weary, haven't we?  still, i believe deep down in each of us we hope and we pray if not for a better world at least for a better day  thank you for being my best friend i don't remind you of that often enough especially as the moons pass thank you for seeing me through excrement you know what they say about a friend in need  these words are all i can afford now these words, i feel, are not enough in describing your place in my life but these words are all i can offer and you have my word  that i'll be there for you for life what's a decade? a lifetime of wonderful memories and on this, your birthday i wish you a lifetime more

      i did a really short photo shoot for the editor of the magazine I work for on an ad hoc basis. this was wednesday morning. i'd never been to the zoo so early in the day. the ed wanted to have her photo with the orang utans.  we were done by 10 a.m. since i got into the zoo for free, i figured i might as well hang around, see the animals and take photos. the zoo wasn't too crowded 'cos it was a weekday. in fact, it would have been less crowded if not for the hordes of kindergarten and lower primary students who had just completed their mid-year exams.  i took a photo with a python. i watched the primates show, which was entertaining. there's a new elephants at work and play show, which is really good too. got to take lots of photos. also watched lots of animal feedings. thoroughly enjoyed the polar bear feeding. the enclosure seems really small, after having seen the polar bear shores in sea world, gold coast.  besides the animals, i caught sight of a chin-dian wedding couple taking photos in the zoo. well, it wasn't just taking photos with the scenery... two of the elephants were walked from their enclosure to a more scenic part of the zoo for photos with the couple. they must be loaded.  i left the zoo after seeing what i wanted to see and finishing all my film. errrr... finishing all my memory card space. i'm not into deleting photos on the spot unless they are really bad. can't really see much detail on the camera's LCD. by the time i got home, it was almost 4 o'clock.  xl events/magazine photo shoots are always a delight. :)

      today was unusual. i discovered that the COSDUmembers yahoo group had mysteriously vanished. no trace. just a simple message:  There is no group called COSDUmembers . yahoo? boo-hoo...  while trying to find out if i was the only one with this problem - after all, strange things happen in this place we call earth - i got a hurried invitation for coffee.  so i met up with elaine (and boon wee in passing). she was my north melbourne neighbour, michelle's and tiffani's housemate. we talked and walked. i have to say it was a refreshing chat. we touched on movies, and we somehow talked about wong kar wai. elaine said he has a new film coming up. didn't really catch the title. bought a birthday present for a friend on my way home.  anyway, a friday night at home. par for the course. read a thread in clubsnap about themes for photoshoots. have no bloody idea what they are going on about. ancient chinese history/mythology? beats me. then someone mentions trying to capture the feel of one of the movie posters for wong kar wai's  in the mood for love .  being me, i google and manage to find the movie  urlLink poster  this guy is referring to. i also unearthed an excellent site on wkw films' soundtracks and wkw in general. found out more about his latest film, 2046:   Official Synopsis He was a writer. He thought he wrote about the future but it really was the past. In his novel, a mysterious train left for 2046 every once in a while. Everyone who went there had the same intention.....to recapture their lost memories. It was said that in 2046, nothing ever changed. Nobody knew for sure if it was true, because nobody who went there had ever come back- except for one. He was there. He chose to leave. He wanted to change.  Extended Synopsis The film is set in Chow Mo Wan's (Tony Leung) hotel room from 'In the Mood for Love', room 2046. He is trying to escape from the memory of his broken 'love affair' with Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung). He meets a prostitute played by Zhang Ziyi, whom he falls in love with. This inspires him to write a story about love, time and memory, set in the future - the story is called 2046. In this story, there is a mysterious train that randomly appears where the passengers can travel from the present into the year 2046. They 'ride' to the year 2046 in order to retreive lost memories. Anybody who boards this train cannot return from the future, apart from one man that is, Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung).  Some additional details: Faye Wong apparently plays a robot in the year 2046, She has two men who are in love with her, played by Kimura Takuya (Japanese TV actor) and Chang Chen (Hero). Also Gong Li plays another robot in the future.   robots?  wong kar wai?  anyway, i read the soundtracks faq and come across references to  unicornio . this is a haunting song used in wkw's bmw film,  the follow .     Unicornio   Mi unicornio azul ayer se me perdió. Pastando lo dejé y desapareció. Cualquier información bien la voy a pagar. Las flores que dejó no me han querido hablar.  Mi unicornio azul ayer se me perdió, no sé si se me fue, no sé si extravió, y yo no tengo más que un unicornio azul. Si alguien sabe de él, le ruego información. Cien mil o un millón, yo pagaré. Mi unicornio azul se me ha perdido ayer, se fue.  Mi unicornio y yo hicimos amistad, un poco con amor, un poco con verdad. Con su cuerno de añil pescaba una canción, saberla compartir era su vocación.  Mi unicornio azul ayer se me perdió, y puede parecer acaso una obsesión, pero no tengo más que un unicornio azul y aunque tuviera dos yo sólo quiero aquel. Cualquier información, la pagaré. Mi unicornio azul se me ha perdido ayer, se fue.   if you can get your hands on this song, try to find the version by cecila noel and jeff rona. i read the english translation. does not do the tune nor the spanish lyrics justice.

      i walked around town most of yesterday afternoon, trying to capture images of the city. my photos were stale. they seem even more stale today as i view them. (should never leave photos out overnight. like fruit, they go bad.) it's frustrating. maybe it was the weather. (it was really hot.) maybe it was my mood. (i'm not exactly overflowing with happiness nowadays. but i shouldn't need to be happy to take photos. anyway.) maybe i was looking at things through jaded eyes. (seen the city once, seen the city a thousand times.)  maybe it was the homeless woman sleeping outside bugis junction. (of course, i took a photo of her too, seeing that nothing and nobody else was cooperating.) maybe, just maybe, i'm not as good a photographer as i think i am. (damn, then my lack of interview opportunities is really going to be a problem.)  saw baby sophie in the evening. took photos of her too, just for good measure.  at the end of the day, i came home with a sore knee from the walking earlier in the day.  played squash this afternoon, for the first time in many months. surprisingly, it was with my sister's boyfriend, jeremy. never knew he plays squash. then again, don't know much about him either. he's pretty good (at squash, that is). found out how extremely unfit i am. i've not panted like that... well, ever. i'm usually able to override my tiredness when playing squash or other games i love. but today, my brain was going, "stop! stop! enough!". very unusual.  at the same time, it was good to exert myself. paradoxical but true. knee hurting once more. i'm really going to enjoy getting out of bed tomolo, when all of my muscles gather to protest their innocence all at once.

      Do NOT be surprised if Singapore is hit by a terrorist attack in the near future. The people dressed in white are engaging in mindless kow-towing to Uncle Sam. Singaporeans have no channel to voice their disapproval or (more sadly yet more likely) are just not bothered.  Just carry on with our daily lives, though. Just carry on. And when something happens, the people dressed in white will paint it as an attack on our sovereignty and trumpet our great patriotism in overcoming this tragedy. Someone else will take the fall.  P.S. If this screws the possiblity of a job in the civil service, so be it. I believe in this country, just not the men in white.  P.P.S. I don't like blogspot's funky new layout.

      i'm aware that my blog has been a constant stream of career talk and life decisions. i apologise in advance, this entry is another one. i can't recall if i've mentioned this before, but i am sure that i emailed the link to this article to a few of my close friends.   urlLink  what should i do with my life?    two phone calls and a post in the photography forum in the past few hours prompted me to recall this article. the first phone call was from melbourne. we had a good chat as usual during the course of which this person expressed doubt about studies. but the key sentence my friend expressed: i like working with people. my friend's future profession will involve this. the problem is the 'content' of the profession.  the second call was to someone much closer to home. i called about something, but we continued on from there. this friend, to my surprise, was embarking on a new career path. i hadn't thought that my friend would be interested in this career but it seems that my friend is growing into it.  the post on clubsnap: the eternal question of whether someone should stay in a current job or pursue photography to the detriment of the current (and stable) income. everyone said, family first. i said, "passion". and proceeded to write a damn long entry about it.  of course, this is when my computer decided to hang. i almost can see damian sniggering about the wonders of the mac and the hopelessness of windows.  anyway, i remembered the article, so i posted the link there.  i'm sure that some of you reading my blog are at the same stage of life or about to embark on this stage. please read the article and think about it...

      i'm not a delta goodrem fan by any stretch of the imagination. in fact, i really don't like her acting (on the aussie series  neighbours ) nor her singing.  but there's something about the australian tourist commission ad that she voiced. every time i watch it, i wish i was back in australia. the short version almost has no visual connection to melbourne, but it still manages to send a tingle of longing thru' my spine.  those of you who know me are aware of my perennial love-hate relationship with oz and its people. singapore is still home. =)  --------- i can sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w    by arthur hamilton     red   and   yellow   and   pink   and   green     purple   and   orange   and   blue   i can sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   too  listen with your eyes listen with your ears and sing everything you see i can sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   sing a   r  a  i  n  b  o  w   sing a long with me ---------  click on the title of the post to download a lo-res version of the ad (wmv file,   download   a high-res version (about 7mb) from the australian tourist commission site.

      1999. bayern munich were up 1-0 in the european champions league final in the 90th minute. three minutes of injury time. beckham takes a corner, and after a goalmouth scramble, giggs miscues a shot from outside the penalty box which reaches sheringham. he turns the ball in empathically.  while the director is showing the replay of the goal and scenes of united supporters going crazy, united wins another corner. becks take it, sheringham dummies, the ball looks like its going to flash across the goal. solskjaer sticks out his leg acrobatically...  pandemonium. =)  a few minutes ago. england is up 1-0 against france. beckham had a penalty saved by barthez in the second half, a miss that would haunt england in three minutes of injury time. 90th minute. foul outside the box. zidane steps up. he and his teammates have not had the best of games. the ball whizzes past the wall. england keeper james doesn't even see it coming. rooted to the spot, he watches a silver flash bulge the net.  england 1 france 1. france go on the offensive. outside the box, around the area that the earlier foul was committed, gerrard attempts to pass the ball back to the keeper not realising henry is lurking with intent. james clatters into henry. yellow card. penalty.  zidane once again. he takes the penalty. james dives to his left. the ball was rifled into the opposite corner. england 1 france 2.  pandemonium. =(  i've always said three minutes is a long time in football.

      FUCK.  YES, I NORMALLY SWEAR ONLY WHEN I'M WEARING GREEN. BUT THIS OCCASION WARRANTS IT.  I AM TRYING TO BE VERY CALM NOW.  I'VE LOST AT LEAST THREE YEARS WORTH OF DATA.  ALL MY WORK FROM UNI.  ALL THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE POURED THROUGH.  ALL MY COSDU FILES.  PERSONAL STUFF I'VE WRITTEN.  LETTERS AND EMAILS WHICH MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.  AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.  I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE SHIT LATELY BUT THIS REALLY TAKES THE CAKE.  FUNNY THING IS THAT IT HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF HELPING A TOTAL STRANGER.  I WAS COPYING FILES FROM A DIRECTcd TO MY HARD DISK.  THIS WAS TAKING AN ETERNITY, SO I PUT IT IN MY CD BURNER, HOPING THAT I'D GET BETTER TRANSFER RATE.  AND I did GET A BETTER RATE. TRIED TO EJECT THE CD.  A VERY MOMENTARY BLUE SCREEN. AUTO REBOOT.  SCANDISK. WINDOWS TAKES LONGER THAN NORMAL TO LOAD.  I CHECK MY ARCHIVE CD.  BLANK.  NOT POSSIBLE.  EJECT.  CHECK AGAIN.  BLANK.  DIRECTcdS TAKE A WHILE TO FORMAT. HOW CAN IT BE...  BLANK.  (I SWEAR THAT STUPID EURO 2004 STARHUB SMS UPDATE THING I SUBSCRIBED TO IS REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES. IT'S FUCKING 0318 HRS. YES, THAT'S 3.18 A.M. AND I'M GETTING AN SMS (FOR THE THIRD TIME) ON WHO THE BLOODY ITALIAN MANAGER, TRAPATTONI OR FUCKARRONI OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS, WANTS OR DOESN'T WANT TO INCLUDE IN HIS SQUAD. I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT ITALY. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF PANNUCI IS PLAYING. MAYBE I MIGHT WANT TO KNOW AT ANOTHER TIME, BUT  NOT NOW . NOT AT 3 A.M. IN THE FUCKING MORNING, NOT WHEN THIS HAS JUST HAPPENED TO ME, AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE THIRD TIME!)  I REALLY FEEL LIKE THROWING MY LAPTOP OUT OF THE WINDOW.  AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR GOOD FRIEND, THE CD BURNER WHILE YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY OUT.  THANKS A LOT.  AND MY PHONE GOES OFF AGAIN. FUCKARRONI AGAIN. OH, LET PANNUCI PLAY. ITALY WON'T WIN ANYWAY.   FUCKING SHIT.  PERFECT, JUST PERFECT. ANYTHING ELSE NEEDS TO GO WRONG? GO WRONG NOW, WHILE GOING WRONG IS ON A ROLL.  p.s. to self: one day you will read this and laugh.

      i've finally found proof that today's music is mostly the same! click on the title of this post to download a nickelback song... no, two nickelback songs which sound so alike, it's amazing. one song on the left speaker, one song on the right speaker. and both sound like the same thing. be amazed.  well, i've maintained that all those new 'rock' bands sound like each other, it's so hard to tell them apart. that 'college' rock sound, i believe someone coined it. an evolution of boy bands - and we know all of those sound the same already - only with instruments.  i came across the mp3 file through this disinfo article on   piracy  . which lead me to this   blog entry  :    As if there weren't already enough reasons to laugh at Nickelback   It's probably no surprise that I don't enjoy "popular" or "Top 40" music. It's corporate, bland, overplayed, unoriginal, boring, bland, and boring, It's also dumb. But just because I don't enjoy it doesn't mean I don't listen to it. I mean, how can you not when radio and TV is infested with this crap. Lately, one of the bands that I love to hate is Nickelback, slowly climbing the ranks and placing themselves up at the top with Creed, Matchbox 20, and countless others as "worst bands in the history of music."  So I received tremendous joy when I found the following file over on the SA Forums. Some internet genius took Nickelback's first horrible "hit," and mixed it with Nickelback's newest awful "hit." By "mixed" I mean one shitty song plays in the left speaker, and the other ear-bleeding excuse for rock plays in the right speaker. What a surprise, they are almost EXACTLY THE SAME. It's uncanny, sad, and hilarious at the same time.   Nickelback - How You Remind Me Of Someday   I felt it was my duty to share this song in order to spread the word on how horrible music is today, and I hope you all do the same. Oddly enough, this song incest sounds better than anything Nickelback will ever actually play.  Posted by Brandon at April 5, 2004 04:26 PM   which brings me to piracy. copyright law and intellectual property rights (IPRs) need to be reexamined. this is especially so with music. people have always recorded music (and tv shows, among other thigns) since recordable media has been around. but now, with almost perfect digital copies, the powers that be are bleating about stealing. well, we've always been stealing, if that's the case.  IPRs are supposed to promote   creativity   and enable owners of intellectual properties to profit from them for   a finite period  .  arguably, IPR has failed on the first count, if one looks at the music being churned out today. IPR has definitely failed on the second count. the length of copyright has been progressively extended since the conception of IP law. the extensions to the copyright usually occur when mickey mouse is under threat. yes, the mouse was supposed to return to the public domain a long time ago. ironic that disney cartoons have been profiting from stories that have been in the public domain for ages.  but back to music... who's really doing the stealing? record labels are usually the owners of copyright for the songs. how much really goes back to the artistes? the ones who were supposed to be stimulated by the propect of profits which IPR enable.  then there's this strange assumption that decline in CD sales is directly due to music piracy. perhaps the lack of quality music, or at least ORIGINAL music in Nickelback's case, is the cause. of course, that notion is absolutely ludicrous and inconceivable, isn't it?  if an album contains songs that justify their presence on my playlist, i will buy the cd. (i'll probably rip the songs to mp3 for my personal use on my laptop, but apparently even this form of copying is prohibited.)   you see, the album is an anachronism. we didn't have a choice in the past. good songs mixed with humdrum filler material. want the good songs? get the whole album. the entire music industry should realise that people want - and are able to get - choice. they should get off their asses and respond to consumer demand instead of sticking to paradigms that belong in the trash can of time. instead of making downloading and customising cds illegal, they should tap into this.  of course, efforts are getting underway. but the RIAA and the music industry in general has treated consumers like criminals so don't expect consumers to be highly receptive to these new avenues of legal downloading.  just because copyright law exists as it does today doesn't mean it's moral or ethical. i do, however, believe in buying original DVD movies. but that's another story. if i really want to get into the intricacies of copyright law with respect to each type of work, i'll be writing another media law paper...  speaking of which, for the mcm people, i bumped into stephen paine and teo yi ling at the LOTR exhibition last week. they're ENGAGED!

      i don't know what i can write about the movie  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind . it's absolutely brilliant. and it strikes a chord in me. more so than other films, every one will have a thoroughly unique experience with this movie as it confronts us with the sunshine and specter of relationships past.   "would you erase me?"  asks one of the movie posters for this film.  no.  no, i wouldn't.

      "not good" in tv/film production parlance.  it also happens to describe my day.  i botched up a short photo job. that's entirely my fault. i own up to it. it's not a good feeling but i can't complain. i put myself in the line of fire, so i'm obliged to turn up with the goods. today, i didn't.  then two things out of my control hit me almost simultaneously, both in the guise of innocent-looking white envelopes...   with ON GOVERNMENT SERVICE marked on them. one was addressed to 3SG(NS) PINTO and the other had the MOE logo.  the inevitable has occured. i'm officially an NSman again. yes, more IPPTs, recalls/mobilisation exercises and ICTs for me. (hahah, already using abbreviations.) so, my decision last week to lose weight has added imperative now. after reaching 100kg (yes, you read that right, and i admit it's all my own doing), i decided enough was enough. but now, reaching 80kg and getting my fitness up to Silver IPPT standard is not a matter of choice. in any case, it wasn't a call-up, just a friendly reminder that i can now be issued the (in)famous SAF 100.  the second envelope contained a letter that i've seen before, many years ago, when i was still doing full-time NS. post-A levels, post applying to NIE. yes, the country that is short of teachers (but not short of applicants apparently) because of high turnover refused to even interview me once again.  appropriate, somehow, that both letters arrived on the same day, then.  teach. do something worthwhile with your life.  yah, right.

      despite my belief that i'm a patriot, i'm not one to get involved in the hype surrounding the  national day parade , which is a "NE" lesson with a certain slant.   but  this year, there are a plethora of  activities  and  events  which look like they'll be loads of fun. i'm definitely looking forward to the  singapore fireworks festival , held on three sundays in august. still waiting for that set of fireworks to outdo moomba in melbourne. but quite difficult here even if they coordinate the fireworks to music (like i hear they did for the opening of 'the durians') 'cos fireworks in singapore - particularly at marina bay - are very very far away from the audience. part of the fireworks experience, i feel, is feeling the explosive power of the fireworks, not just seeing them. think the minimum safe distance here is way too far for enjoyment.  there's other stuff too... carnivals, food fest, street performances, a  skydiving festival  even...  august looks like it's going to be an eventful month in singapore, and for me personally too.

      Last week, I climbed a mountain.   I never got around to writing about it here. Now that a week has passed, I feel even less inclined to write. I guess that's what photos are for. Here are two.   Might update this entry later. Hahaha... we all know I won't get around to that. =P   Jason, Dennis (partially hidden) and Edmund jump for joy at the summit of Gunung Ledang (Mount Ophir), 1276m. We walked all night (actually, from about 3 a.m.) to get to the summit (a.k.a. Checkpoint Eight) from our 'base camp' near Checkpoint Five       Dennis, Edmund, Jason, Felicia, Eugene, Moi, Gerry and Lup Wai at Checkpoint Three
