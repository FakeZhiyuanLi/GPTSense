      Lol, how true is the link below??  I found it rather amusing among other things in my day!  I'm pretty bored though, there is just nothing to do!!!  I have people left, right and centre saying how they're doing things and I'm stuck inside :o(.  Ahhh well.  Hopefully I'll find things to do -- and when I do, I'll be sure to shove it in here :op.  Speak soon, Blogger!!  Andy -------------  urlLink Every Law You Hate

      Today I went to Blackpool Pleasure Beach.  It was a very good day indeed! Started with me going to sleep at 3AM and waking at 6AM, lol, in a rush to get read and out of the house to Piccadilly Train Station for 8:15AM.  So there is me, rushing away like a maniac seen only in a mental asylum, getting all prepared, showered and out of the door...I catch the buses and walk at my fast pace just to get there.  When I get there about 30 mins early.  So i wait, and about 6 coaches from Stockport appear...but no James, Kylie, Vicky or Michelle.  More time passes, and when they eventually appear, we spend more time in the shops of the station than anywhere else!! ugh.  Then we have the train journey, which wasn't too bad!  And then we had the weateher :O) Yes, it was interesting, to say the least!  What with rain and wind pushing everything! lol, but despite it was rather funny to see Kylie struggling away with an umbrella as the forces of nature destroyed it!  Then we got on a rickety old tram, go to the pleasure beach and "Opens at 11:30" **looks at watch** "10:25" Arghhhh, so we all blamed Vicky and just went in an arcade after yet more roaming around in the soaking rain.  But overall, when the park did open, and we were thoroughly soaked through -- and then more so from Valhalla **remembers Vicky's "maximising" eyeliner** lol, it was a V. V. good day!!  Thanks to my friends who went, it couldn't have been any better really.  Even with the early-ness.  It just added to the fun factor as much as the weather did.  Ahhhh, lol, I'm rushing this entry now -- but -- I'm also quite happy that School is out.  Finally I have some freedom!  And can properly plan ahead for Canada now.  I'm feeling so weird -- detached from my friends, even though I want to keep them all because they ARE all GREAT -- and confused as to what to do from day to day.  hrmm.  But nm, all will eventually sort out, I am sure.  Hopefully I will also post in here much more -- and you can **hopefully** look forward to another entry in this later!!  See you soon,  Andy

      I feel very messy at the moment.  I'm all drenched from the nice lovely rain that devided to pour down as I stepped on the bus, and went away.  Then it comes back as I step off the bus!! Thank you mother nature!  Also, I was supposed to be going to School to do some History revision lessons.  But thanks to the traffic, I was unable to get to the station on time, and then the on time bus+15mins eventually made it's way and got me to school, so I just managed to catch Mrs. Fahey running round the field -- must have been some sponsored run, and then she did my countersigning for my passport.  But hrmm -- I'm all very awkward feeling.  Had a good day yesterday, Liam let myself and a group of other friends come round to watch the match.  Yeah, he had the usual one thing at least break :oP, and it was a pretty good day all round!  I would go into more detail but you can never be sure who'll read something :oD so better safe than sorry!!  I'm being briefed on MSN about teh "Radium City" I remember being told once about it in History -- how the watches they made were using radium, and the workers would lick their pain brushes and paint the dials with it -- not knowing it was radioactive. It's a strange thing really to find out years later that so many people did die during it, and they were all hidden away, confidentially.  It's also rather sinister, and makes you wonder -- just how many people in our own country "die" or "go missing" every year?  We'll never know, or at least no time soon.  Anywho, I shall take my leave.  I will try to speak later, so for now --  Bye.

      Wow -- it's pretty early in the morning, and I'm still awake.  Hrm, I guess that is what made me do this little bloggy thingy.  I have nothing better to do these times I just can't sleep, so now I can at least be doing something constructive.  Let's just hope that these posts don't scare away the few people who probably would read it!!!  See you around,  Andy.

      And I really am feeling the effects of excitement now!! It's like, wow! I didn't think it would happen so quickly, and it is!! Plus yesterday I was with m8's and expanding my social skills and today I was with m8's who I have known throughout high school!! How much better can things be?? Alot! But what the heck! =D  Anywho! I can't wait for the 6 days to go through, yet at the same time I can wait and I want to do so much in them!! I have to also make a list of all the things my parents have to do while I am away, such as pick up my gcse reslts and sort my college placement!  And that's another thing! College placement! Eeeeck! Oh and gcse results - which I am doubting heavily! =( But alas, if they don't go well..no college placemnt to die over because of!  Anywho, I hope all will go great - hope being the key word! Will write in this more!  Andy
