      For my birthday this year Drew and Kelly were visiting their Aunt Mary and Uncle Mike in Clifton, enroute to PA to visit their Aunt Fran, Uncle John and cousins Kerry and Brian. So, Alex and I were on our own that day. She woke me up that morning to tell me to get dressed because we were going to Giant to pick out my birthday cake! She picked out a very cute cake (see below) and of course I HAD to have a balloon as well! Then we were off to Target for a couple things, and while we were there Alex picked up some party items for us (plates, cups, hats, etc.) as well as a wonderful gift. She made my day very special and it is a birthday I'll never forget.

       urlLink    Alex picked out a very nice Care Bear cake for me! She sang me Happy Birthday all by herself (she wouldn't let me sing with her :-) The cake was delicious. As you can see she also picked out Elmo cups and hats, and Hello Kitty plates!  urlLink

       urlLink    This is the present and card that Alex gave me for my birthday. We painted the tea set together, then put it in the oven to set. This was a lot of fun and a Great Idea! (Alex really did pick this out!) Now I'll always have a keepsake of my 39th birthday.  urlLink

      While my parents were here visiting us in VA, we drove into Washington DC to see the WWII Memorial. It is a beautiful memorial and a fitting tribute to the men and women that served our country in WWII.  After visiting the Memorial we walked the length of the reflecting pond towards the Capital building, walked through the Korean memorial and took the tour bus around Washington. We also had a great lunch at Union Station.

      Hello everyone!  Well, my last attempt at a BLOG was unsuccessful - the software was very uncooperative and I lost my BLOG when I tried to reinstall the software.  So I've found this 'Blogger' software and it is supposed to be really good - so I'll try again!  The kids are really enjoying their summer.  Both Drew and Kelly have a new-found interest in tennis.  They now both have their own tennis rackets (thanks goes to my neighbor John for taking them out to buy them!)  and will go to tennis camp later in August.  For now they are having fun and learning all they can by playing with neighbors and friends.  Drew's baseball team The Dragons won the Championship!  Drew had a great season at short stop and he became the de-facto relief pitcher - very cool under pressure!  Clarence (our cat) - now almost 16 yrs old - had some health issues and we thought we were going to lose him.  The vet thinks he has either early renal failure or thought more probably had lymphoma.   However, with the help of my amazing friend/neighbor/vet tech Danielle, he's been brought out of critical status and is back to his old self (just a skinnier version).  He gets IV fluids every couple days with Danielle's help and is back to eating regular food again.  Cats really do have 9 lives!  Lets hope Clarence isn't on his 9th!  Calli, the newest member of our family is doing great.  She's part German Shepherd, Australian Cattle dog, and we're pretty certain part Husky.  She's fit right in, and we're very thankful to Danielle for bringing her into the Kavanagh family!  Stay tuned for pictures of Calli very soon.

      Well, the time came when we thought it best to let Clarence go to Cat Heaven. The days and weeks leading up to his last day with us were still good for Clarence. He was eating again and was still active (jumping up on the counters, fighting us for our food, etc), however he continued to lose weight and his latest blood work was worse than before. It was only a matter of time before he would begin to suffer and we wanted to prevent that as best we could. He died very peacefully on Tuesday, August 10th with Drew, Kelly and I comforting and petting him; We told him to say hello to Jezabell and Daddy for us, and that we were sure Daddy was waiting for him up there with a popsicle to share with him.  Later that day we buried him in the woods next to his sister Jezabell. Drew, Kelly, Alex, my friends John and Danielle and I layed flowers on his grave and said goodbye to a wonderful friend and companion.  It's strange in the house without him. During the past months (especially after we got Calli) he took to hanging out on a pillow in my bedroom...it's odd to look there now when I enter the room or wake up in the middle of the night and not seem him snoozing away. It is somehow sad that we can now leave glasses of water and bowls of food unattended without fear of spilling or swiping. It will take some getting used to.  We have some of his fur (some orange and some white of course) and 4 paw prints in plaster that the vet gave us as a rememberance. But I think we will all remember him in our own ways and always hold a place in our hearts for him...until we meet again.
