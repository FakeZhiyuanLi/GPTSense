      Kennan Callahan, "Effective Church Leadership"   "The day of the professional minister is over. The day of the missionary pastor has come."   These two statements describe what has taken place, not what may occur...

      I was reading a TIME magazine article abotu the decline of the protestant church in America.  A minister was quoted:  "The Hebrew prophets never had a majority, and yet they had important things to say.  Maybe this is a positive wake-up call for us to worry less about numbers and more about faithfulness and relevancy.  It's moral authority, not a function of size".  I read that and agreed with it except for one word, " relevancy ".  God speaks for Himself, the Word of God is relevant, relevancy is not important for us...at the end of the day it's all about how faithful you have been to God.   I guess it all goes back to your view of God...  If God is not big enough, we do silly things If God is not relevant, we try to make Him so, even though He does not require it of us God asks us to simply be faithful.  GOD is bigger than...

      Missions is usually understood as something churches support that takes place somewhere else through specially trained professionals known as missionaries.  Evangelism is often seen as something a few persons do in a local congregation through a committee, or as one of the programs of the church, or as something done in and through a parachurch organization.  There are two fundamental problems with such understandings.   First, they fail to relate missions and evangelism adequately to the larger framework of the mission of God.   Secondly, because of this, they fail to recognize the relationship between the life and ministry of the church and God's mission in the world.    Mission and Evangelism is to be inherent within the very nature of the church. It starts with the belief that the Triune God is a missionary God.

        Joe Aldrich said in his book, Lifestyle Evangelism, that “Christians are to be good news before they share the good news.”  St Francis of Assisi said “Always preach the Gospel, and when necessary, use words.”

      When the gospel of Jesus Christ is described as “good news” few in our society run after it as if were the latest, as if it were the most dramatic, or as if it were the most important.   The gospel, “good news,” is widely viewed as little more than harmless religious gossip: shallow, trite, ineffectual.  What is our response?  Some of us forsake the gospel, some of us agree and don't read the gospel, some of us read too much into the gospel to answer the questions of society...  Just be faithful to God...his word is tried, tested and true.

         The apostle Paul says that he isn’t ashamed of the gospel.    Jesus insists that no sacrifice is too great for the gospel.    Peter says he, along with others, have given up everything for the gospel.     The church lives by the gospel and for the gospel; in other words the gospel alone is the foundation of the church and the gospel alone is the mission of the church.

        God is moving to accomplish His purpose and to build His kingdom in the world today.  God has been moving through history and since the biblical time to overcome the forces of evil and destruction and to build His kingdom  Christ is glorified through the life and witness of the church in many parts of the world through planting new churches, reconciliation between people, and transformed communities  God is challenging us to move from self-centric viewpoint to global perspective on mission  God is calling people to be closer to Him and then God will use them and will let them experience that His glory fills the earth.

      The title of this Blog comes from Exodus 3:14.  "And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM', and He said, 'Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM, has sent me to you.''"  God told Moses His name =  I AM , as a result...every one of us, every single person's name is = I am not. Why? simply because we are not God.  'I am not' (my name and your name) but I know ' I AM ' (God's Name).  One of my goals in life is to preach and remind people wherever I go that God is  HUGE .  I AM.  Secondly, to say with confidence that wherever I serve I can say, "I AM, has sent me to you."
