      Guess what! SPIN's very own Chuck Klosterman will be doing a fun-filled book tour. Expect to find him in a city near you very soon. And if he's not in your city, then you should drive to a city that he'll be in. It's worth it.

      Holy shit, that post seemed like a paid advertisment from A Drug Free America or  something.  Drugs are great. Booze is fantastic. I miss them both and i plan on reaquainting myself with them shortly. There's nothing like dancing to Blondie when the lights are all over the place and you're totally loaded and you're not preoccupied with the fact that your coordination and balance stopped existing the day you grew two big boobies.

      OK! So sobriety is so much easier after the first week, which is why I didnt update this on tuesday or wednesday. Let's see, monday night I did nothing, but doing nothing was fun because it meant that I could sit at home and watch tv. Tuesday night I went to the Viscious party at Sin-e (after getting dinner with Maureen, Lizzy and Tracey at Steak Frites) with my brother Lawrence. I went to check out a band or two -- all saddle creekers -- but got bored and spent most of the time outside chit chatting. Audrey told me how the first five times i met her i never remembered who she was because i was so drunk ... which is terribly embarassing because i fucking love her. I gotta say, this sobriety thing is an eye opener of sorts. Even though I was thinking of jumping off the wagon tomorrow, I think i might hold out a bit longer because i feel a fuck load better and probably look healthier, not to mention I remember shit.   Last night i went to Lollapalooza. Totally great. That's all.   Today my wonderful dear friend Barry comes to NYC. He's scottish, i dont think he's ever met a sober person in his life.   Tomorrow is stellastarr*, elefant, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs... PLUS I'm DJing the ss* after party. I'm definitely gonna stay sober until I get to the party, this way i can actually accomplish something.

      I had a very lazy sunday at home. Did some house work, ate a lot, and rummaged online for a bit in an effort to learn something educational. Tonight I will buy rock and roll underwear from Victoria's Secret, then watch TV.  Bert from the Used was supposed to call so i can interview him, and surprise, surprise, he didn't. I think he could use a sobriety blog as well.  This week will be busy for me, but not as bad as usual:  Tuesday i'm seeing the 22s at Pianos, then heading to Sin-e for a very special Viscious party so i can see that guy from Calla perform. Wednesday it's probably Lollapalooza, but i should probably decide on that already. Thursday it's a knitting circle with the Bilderberg media group. then the Vue and then the Witnesses. ... or wait, was the knitting cirlce moved? Friday, it's stellastarr* and Elefant! And my friend Barry is coming to town. He's scottish.

      I'm still sober kids. Last night i was supposed to go to alex's party but bailed out on it in favor of watching SNL and sleeping before midnight. I feel bad about not hanging out with Raphael and Adam like i said i would, but going out is hard when Alcohol is not only calling your name, it's shouting it while promising you an oasis of hot young men who want to dance all night long... ONLY IF YOU'RE DRUNK.    I did get dinner with Lance, which was nice. We ate at Suba.   Cheers Queers.

      OK. So i had a sip of wine at dinner. My body literally shook. I think it's really starting to hate me for not drinking and is totally freaking the fuck out.  urlLink Raphael  and I are going to a party tomorrow night at  urlLink Alexander  and  urlLink Ryan's  place and I was thinking "i should invite Raph over to drink a bit before we head out to party." and then i remembered that i couldnt do that because sobriety wil continue until august 1.

      Holy fucking shit. I managed to go out to a club, DJ, and not have a single drop of alcohol DESPITE the endless amount of drink tickets. Holy crapola. This was after Paul's birthday dinner, and also after the Distillers show which i ended up missing by 15 minutes.  No boozy booze for me. God was it boring.

      OK. My lunch with Cappa went really well. We had pasta, talked about how you dont need drugs or alcohol to have fun, and he said I had a good aura.   Then I sat on his lap for a picture.   Now I'm going to Paul's birthday party at Baluchi's and then I'll be DJing at Bar13 at around Midnight.  Must nap. Must shower. Must not drink.

      OK, so this is Cappadonna: http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472556/20030611/cappadonna.jhtml?headlines=true  I've been instructed to sit on his lap for a photo and so far I've learned that he gave up all his material pocessions, lived on the streets, and became a cab driver. He and I have a lot in common. He's got triplets and I've got twins.

      Last night Jake came with me to the Alien Ant Farm show at BBKings. We sat at a table like it was dinner theater, ate fries, and I drank a coke. They were really awesome. I met them afterwards backstage but I hate doing shit like that because I feel like such a groupie.   I then went to Caryn's birthday party. Everyone was drunk. I went home.   Everyone was drunk at home.   Today I have to interview Cappadonna for "Making Out with Ultragrrrl" and I really dont know shit about the Wu Tang Clan. They're great, ok. But what the shit am i supposed to ask? I told his publicist that I'd only do the interview if Mr. C ate lunch with me. She said there would be a buffet, but that's not enough. I want him to be stuffing his face so that our half hour goes by and I've only been able to ask him 3 quesitons.

      Yesterday I stayed in. I was supposed to see my friend Max's band, but instead i picked up a falafel and fries and watched a reel of Christina Aguilera's greatest TV moments with Lizzy and Niki. When that was over I chatted with Raphael online and wrote some friendster testimonials. I then watch the Daily show and went to sleep. I woke up an hour later, smoked a cigarette and stared at the TV on mute. The airconditioning lulled me to sleep.  Today I am going to see Alien Ant Farm with my friend Jake. I'm then going to Caryn's birthday party at the Slipper Room. I'm staying for a spell and then walking home so I can catch either the first or second showing of the Daily Show and Tough Crowd.

      I gave birth last night when Madonna and Britney made out. I swear to you. A fucking baby popped out of my body... all bloody and kicking and screaming. Holy fucking shit. Then, I went to the Fader party and drank a lot at their open bar, but somehow i managed to not be the drunkest person there (in my party at least). This was after like, 6 beers or something. I was just driving myself to work, but there was not much to work with. So at about 2am, i took the kids home so they could go to sleep and i listened to sigur ros and wished i was drunker.

      I was just reminded that last night I tried to be good on my promise to snort coke off the ass of  urlLink Giulia . Apparently i started yelling out to the crowd at SPRINGSTREET "Does anyone have any coke?" I imagine I yelled this more times than i should've. I tend to do such things.

      my new favorite band:    holy shit i'm so tired. i forgot that alcohol makes me sleeepy the next day. i want to go home and listen to interpol over and over again and sleep.   Dear Body. I'm sorry i drank last night. We had a deal tho. Tuesdays are ok. Stop being such a brat and pull yourself together. I can't drink any more cokes because i feel cavities forming. I need to stay awake. It's up to me now, bring in the white lines.

      Tuesday is my designated, day-of-the-week, drinking day. I can drink on tuesdays because i dont go out really on fridays, and I dont go out that much on saturdays (saturdays are the new night to stay in and watch tv).   So last night I drank. It started off with two margaritas at Life on B and 10th (ew, why?) with Lizzy and Maureen, and ended on 3 caronas at SPRINGSTREET. The Panthers and Japanther were both DJing and I met up with my brother and a few other friends. My friend Stephen had just come from dinner at the SoHo House and presented me and Giulia with the reciept so we could at least touch it. $20 for 3 shrimp. I dont eat the bugs, but fuck me, that's expensive.  Needless to say, even after 5 drinks last night, I never got drunk. Giggly, yes, but never drunk. How am i building up a tolerance? This is pants!  Duran Duran tonight. Imran comes from London. He's going with AFI to the MTV VMAs. Tim arrives on friday for the Springsteen shows. I feel like there are more people visitng other than that... but i'm looking at my long weekend and realizing that it's gonna be very expensive and very drunk. Oh sobriety, where are you?

Along with Chloe Svigney's brother, we're going to snort coke off the ass of our youngest member, Giulia, and then not talk to anyone within 4 feet of us. Certainly not you. Certainly not your friends. And definitely not to each other. We're too elitist to do such things. Then we're going to write about the whole thing on our blogs and be dissed by the  urlLink The Anit-Blogger . Motherfuckers, i haven't seen a white person in so long, i've gotta find a mirror to remember what color i am.

      Oh my God. I totally forgot. There's this guy that works at Pink Pony who totally looks like this Peter Pan guy:     At the Bjork/Sigur Ros after party I went up to him and totally thought they  were  the same guy. I was like "Hey! You're the Peter Pan guy!" and he was like "Huh?" and I said "The guy on the internet that dresses like Pan! That's totally you!" and he said no and floated away.

      Thanks for ruining my sobriety, or rather, my change in drinking habits. i went from drinking *maybe* one drink a night to 4 beers, 2 jack and coke, and one vicodin. At least i got to watch Sigur Ros/Bjork, drive bumper cars, and dance with a guy dressed as Pappa Smurf. But what the fuck man? I ended up falling asleep mid sentance while sitting on my couch watching TV. Fuck you Saturday night!

      OK, so on second thought about the whole  urlLink sigur ros / urlLink bjork  show thing...  urlLink Vicodin  seems like such a great choice for the event. I will float. Pretty, pretty, pretty music. Fluffy clouds. I now remember that once i had to get surgery and was perscribed Vicodin for the pain. There was a sigur ros show shortly after this surgery so my friend Gideon and I popped a few pills and kept on poking each other and saying "feels like pillow." 6 people fainted at this show. None of those people were us.  I did not drink tonight. Just a sip of wine because it's shabbat and God wants me to drink.

      Ok. so i made it through the wedding, drinking ONLY ONE drink. Jack and Coke. Since when do i drink Jack and Coke, i dont know. For whatever reason, nobody in my extended family recognized me. I know it's been a while since they've all seen me, and sure, i've got boobs and ass now, but c'mon... i can't look that much different. A couple of my cousins saw me on VH1 for that Eminem thing and they got a kick out of that, so that made me happy... cause at least they recognized me. Maybe drinking changed the structure of my face? I was looking at photos of me from when i was about 20/21 and i look younger and healthier. I also had no eyebrows because i had plucked them all out to be pencil thin. maybe that changed the way i looked?  Anyway, my friend Stephen is in town starting today. Tomorrow he's taking me to Sigur Ros. I will definitely stay sober for this -- as i do for ever sigur ros show --- because they're soooooo good au natural. I want to sleep. I'm tired.  i love the new kill hannah album. i feel like dressing like them all the time.

      OK. So last night at like, really late o'clock, i went to meet Eve and some people he knew at 3 of Cups. After 2 beers i got really depressed and wanted to leave. The average age of everyone there was probaly 35, and they were all depressing me with their eagarness to be an LA rocker... which is gross to me. A lot of my friends are nearing 35 but they are way cooler than these people at this bar. I was getting the heeby geebies... however, that might've just been from the lap dance i got from the belly dancer. Anyway, i think i overheard someone tell Eve that there wasnt a NYC music scene and i wanted to puke in her face. Also, someone told me that there were no parties at all on sunday nights, and this girl was like 2 years older than me. i think i'm retarded. i know i'm retarded.  Tonight is my second cousin Eric's wedding. I will be eyeing the bar and sneaking drinks into the women's room to down them at record pace. My dress is great. I look forward to meeting nice jewish boys who look like Ricky Martin.

      Gezus, i really am boring when i'm not struggling with booze. I think I'm gonna loose the plot this weekend just to make things interesting again. Oh wait! Saturday is Sigur Ros and Bjork. OK! perfect vicodin toonz. My fridge is FILLED with beer and I'm not compelled to have any of it at all. There is even a cigarette on my table that i'm not bothered with. Saw the Libertines tonight. Poor Carl. He did a great job, but had to do twice the work now that Pete's out. The Living Things were great as well. Anyway... Yeah, i really didnt think i could ever be this boring while being so self absorbed in my own fight for sobriety, but fuck, i am. Eve just called, must meet him at 3 of Cups. I wont drink. Because i'm boring like that.

      OK, so i've decided that Tuesdays are the designated "ok to drink on this school night" night. Way to start off the week, but it looks like i get myself so tired by Fridays (a night i can't even go out on because it's  urlLink Shabbat  and I need to be in Tenafly, NJ for dinner with the family) and Saturdays (a night that has become so over, it's like the trucker hat of days of the week), that i need at least one night during the week when i can not-so-firmly place my feet on the ground and say "Yes, please!" when someone offers me a boozybooze. Last night AWESOME  urlLink Izler's  gig at Pianos was great, and  urlLink the 22's  were like whoa. I would like to make out with every member of that band. I have a MASSIVE fear of the  urlLink female junk , but  urlLink boobies  are OK. I DJed the gig(li) and got a shout out from the 22s, which i thought was sweet.   But let's talk about what we're all here to talk about: Alcohol. Last night was to be the last night  urlLink Barry  and I got to hang out before he was to head back to Scotland on thursday morning. The plan was for Barry to meet me at  urlLink Pianos . This never happened. You know why? Because Barry is about to win the "Biggest Lush on Earth" award. Sorry Bar, but people have got to know that you can't make it from Hoboken to the LES in one piece while drinking a LOT of vodka with Coke on the subway. Apparently by the time Barry got out of the subway he was already in blackout phase and has no idea what happened last night. If you happened upon a cute drunken scottish boy who resembles  urlLink Nick Jago of BRMC , please send me an email and let me know what the fuck he was up to because he has no idea. A cabbie that found his ID along with my number in his car said that he was dropped off at Penn Station very late at night. This is all we know at the moment. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  Also, I've put up a police line-up thing in my bedroom that everyone who visits my house has to pose in front of. I'm giving some of my friends practice, and others are reliving bad memories. Either way, my mom is gonna be really worried when she sees it.     urlLink Laura is a genius.

      Vicki rules. Knowing i was illin' she messengered me over some echinacea and zinc and ginger tea. Now i'll definitely be healthy enough for my DJ gig tomorrow AND the Libertines/Livingthings show on wednesday. NO DRINKING. No Drinking. If you offer to buy me a drink you are friends with evil. Unless you're trying to get me drunk so I'll make out with you... in which case you're stupid cause everyone knows i'm easier than that.

      I would just like to point out that Laura at  urlLink The Modern Age  is the funniest person i know. She's funnier than you. She's funnier than the funniest person you know. She's  that  funny.  I didnt drink on saturday or sunday, but mostly because i was sick and couldnt leave my house. I was supposed to meet Lance for dinner on saturday but the walk from my bathroom to my couch left me light headed. I was in bed by midnight on saturday, and last night i took some left over meds from when i had strep and i think there was ephederine in it because i couldnt sleep. Instead i designed handbags using concert tshirts that were too big for me at 5:30am. The only way i managed to get any shut eye was by listening to Sigur Ros' "Aguytus Bruyopieanmjnfdpaoinfd" on massive headphones.  I think i should take up drinking again. I think i slept better when i was a drunk.

      The blackout ended on the Lower East Side at around 10pm, so rather than sit around at my brother Albert's apt with Sarah watching shitty movies and thinking of ten things i'd rather be doing than watching tv on the Upper west side, i found my friend Eve's number and went to meet up with him at Niagra. He bought me a carona and then we went to Lit to see Carlos DJ. At Lit, Eve and I learned from Carlos that the Libertines/BritishSeaPower/Livingthings show would be moved to either sunday or monday. How Carlos knew this information and Eve didnt (considering eve is in the livingthings) is beyond me, but we celebrated my sobriety and this news with a few drinks.   The BSP boys were milling about and I blamed them for the blackout. They blamed their sound guy. and I just drank. I never got drunk last night. I am pretty surprised considering i had three or four drinks. After last call Eve and I went to my rooftop to smoke cigarettes and drink the Beast, and Greg and Raphael drunk dialed me at around 5am and wouldnt get off the phone. I'm not sure what they were talking about. I think i've made plans with them for tonight, which is always a good time. At around 6:30 I sent Eve home so i could sleep til 3pm. which i did. NO hangover!   I drank last night because it wasn't a school night. And I never got drunk. The more the night went on the more my drunk friends would wander over to my seat at Lit, slur a few words, hug me and walk off. It's really funny to see people who are drunk off their asses when you're sober... but it's also kind of fun to be one of those people. But I gotta say, I appreciate BEING one of those people more when i'm one of them less.  I dont think this post is funny or anything. which pisses me off. i think i just ate too many french fries which isn't really helping anyone, now is it?

      OK. So I would like to apologize to everyone who was fucked by the blackout. I did not mean to listen to the BSP song "Blackout" so many times the power would eventually be turned off in order to give us an ACTUAL blackout. But alas, I guess things work in such ways.  Right now Sarah and I are at my brother's apartment on the Upper West Side where there is electricity. She's watching "How to lose a guy in 10 days" and I'm remembering how i cringed to no end while watching it in february/march when it came out. Geezus. I really, really, really wish that I saw that movie like, 10 months before it came out. Anyway... I think we're gonna go see some "Pirates of the Carribean" as soon as this is over so i can reclaim my balls.   I'm also debating going over to Lit tonight because Carlos D. is supposed to DJ there and I  did  tell him that I'd go see him DJ. But I'm feeling VERY hungover from yesterday's booze cruise, which I forgot to mention, was followed by endless drinking by the SPIN staff at HiFi. The ligths were off but the taps were still running. And so the entire entire staff of Spin was there drinking their money away. I hugged a bunch of glasses of water (the 4 watered down whiskey sours hardly gave me a buzz, so i was trying to conserve some hydration). When I got home me, Lizzy and Sarah gathered around a bottle of wine and Milwakees Beast.   OK. So it looks like i'm not doing pirates. It's late and I'm hungover a bit. I'd just like to point out how amazing yesterday was. Everyone was just so helpful to each other and smiling and happy and wonderful. Walking down the streets, it was like "no power, oh well." It wasnt like 9/11 where you were frantically scurrying in total fear that a million bombs were about to be dropped on your head and  you were going to die and the last thing you said the people you loved was "hold my hair, i feel like hurling." Anyway, i got great photos of everyone just chilling out. Drinking beers on the streets. Smoking cigarettes in the bars. It was all really wonderful. Me and the girls went on the roof to look at the city without any lights on (save for a few of the emergency lights and hospitals). All in all... it was all sort of sweet. I'm sad that my friends missed seeing Bob Dylan. I've gotta be totally selfish and say that i'm sadder for myself for missing British Sea Power. I was really looking forward to this show. Awww... nuts.

       JUSTIN JUSTIN JUSTIN JUSTIN JUSTIN!!!   Last night. Justin. Justin. 1am. Justin. Went directly to Hole afterwards to have a celebratory drink with Maureen and Mary H and Dan A. Since i told Maureen about the show she bought me a drink. Makers and Coke. I barely got through one before wincing. I think i'm starting to hate alcohol. Today at work we're being forced to go on a booze cruise. that's in a half hour. One of the publisher guys asked if i loaded up on carbs so i could stay sober. I warned him that i've hardly eaten a thing and will be a drunk employee. I think he's stoked. Wait. i'm sober. no drinking!  Also, i'm OBSESSED with the song "Blackout" by British Sea Power. Beyond obsessed. Like, i've listened to it about 40 times today.

      forgive me sobriety for i have sinned:     It's been a day since my last post. I'm still in love with British Sea Power. Went to Audrey and Japser's Viscious party last night after hosting a little pre-party bash at my apartment starring  Barry, Raphael, Andrew, and a few of their friends. Viscious was amazing and sold out. I spent that entire time sober, but then I went with Lizzy and Barry to Yes!Selector at SPRINGSTREET to see British Sea Power spin. They were great. They were nice. They were drunk and all passed out all over the place on couches. I suddenly found myself drinking a Makers and Coke and then attempting to drink a second (i got only half way through), when i realized it was time to go home.  I will try not to drink tonight. Justin Timberlake goes on at 1am apparently and I think I'll need to take a nap before the show if I want to rock my body and get naked before the end of the song or whatever. I'm thinking of going over to the Hole afterwards because it'll probably be dirty and fun and drunk... but not drunk for me.  Oh, tomorrow I've got a company outing. We're being put onto a boat and told to drink. Now, since i'm being TOLD to drink... should I? I mean, that would be totally awesome if i got really drunk and demanded a raise or tried to go shot for shot with the publishers. Geeezus. I need a nap.

      Oh. and as far as my drinking goes... it's been smooth sailing (every time i say that i end up face down on my pillow with the world's biggest hangover).  Friday i had no drinks.  Saturday night I indulged in a half can of Milwakees Best (anyone that has come to my house in the past month and had that pushed on them can attest to the fact that it's practically water and not alcohol).  Sunday was a dry night, and last night i was dry as well.  Tonight, Brian's got British Sea Power, Imarobot, and the Polyphonic Spree DJing at his party at SPRINGSTREET (which i'm attending after the fucking awesome VISCIOUS show at sin-e -- mommy and daddy and blue sparks! hotness... thank you japser and audrey!).  I might drink tonight because i wanna do a "making out with ultragrrrl" from the expensive lounges of SPRINGSTREET... and i gotta say that "mowu" is just so much funnier when i'm racing some dood in some band to see who can drink more makers mark/coke.

      Holy crap. The new muse album,  Absolution  is so good it's giving me a headache. i had shabbat dinner at my aunt Nancy's house in Brooklyn tonight. it was my cousin Renee's birthday. I could feel the after affects of over drinking and totally started to feel like shit. i think that at exactly midnight my body was like "haha. i'm gonna fuck you over..." and i started getting crabby. Lawrence and i listened to Roxy Music on the way home and he wouldnt let me play him the Venus in Furs covers. Smart man, my brother. He was genius enough to buy Renee albums by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Pixies, Lillix, and the  Freaky Friday  stk.  Dinner at my aunt's house is like eating with 4 little jewish Chris Rocks. Totally hilarious.

      Dear Devil, I hesitated to call you yesterday when Tracey told me that I could take a summer friday today, which meant that I didnt have to come into work. So i paced around and thought about it for a while. I went to the Walkmen show with Greg, Raphael, and Andrew. It was pouring but the band was awesome. I dont think the wet look is for me, but my boys looked hot. We went back to my house so i could change and get my records for the DJ gig. You came over to hang out with the boys for a bit. We went to the club that used to be Shine on w.broadway and canal. They renovated the space and it's actually totally fucking great with a really nice stage and i'd say it's one of the cooler clubs i've seen in a while. Not cool looking like FUN was, but it was really decent. You came to me in the form of 4 Caronas and 4 Makers Mark and Coke-a-cola. I couldnt say no. You're very agressive sometimes. I wanted to tell you to fuck off, but like, everytime I tried to say something you would interrupt and force yourself into my mouth. What the fuck dude? Totally uncool. This morning I woke up and felt totally violated. I could smell you on my breath and my sweat even smelled like you. You totally knocked me out. If you do that to me again, i swear, it'll be the last time we talk for a long, long time. You're fired.  Fondly, Buckets.

      I'd like to chop the balls off of men who sing so i can see if they'll sound like the guy from  urlLink the Darkness . They're so rediculous it's amazing. I dont think i can even reach notes as high as he can and I dont have balls. I've got chutzpah, but that's different... and that's only when I drink. I've lost my chutzpah. Fuck. Sweet, sweet, sweet liquor, where are you?  My brother  urlLink Albert  suggested that I start attending AA meetings. AA is for those of us who can't control the devil. The devil and I are homeboys. These days he calls and he's like "Yo, what you up to tonight?" and I'm like "Oh, not much. I was thinking of meeting up with the boyfriends at Pianos" and he's like "Oh, can i come?" and i'm like "No dude, not tonight. Meet up with us on Saturday." and he's like "Cool. See ya then." Before it was like "I'm meeting up with the boys at Pianos, but maybe you wanna come over before then so we can make out for a bit and then meet up with the guys?"  I like  urlLink Interpol  more than I like  urlLink the Strokes . My brother who thinks I should go to AA doesnt know who these bands are, but if you want to send me hate mail, do so. slewitinn@spin.com

      What the fuck? Friendster is making me and my friends into gigantic question marks and now you cant see the photo of me balancing a beer bottle on my head. That's the pits man. There are kids out there who need to see what a lot of drinking does to your ability to reason and look sane. Retarded! What good is taken photos of yourself while drunk if you dont have anyone to share them with and say "hey, you're a total knobhead." People should call each other knobheads as well. Tim is a knobhead.  I saw this comedy skit that Jake directed last night. It starred the Man Show boy who isnt actually 10 but 27. This boy is a knobhead.

      OK, so last night I was very bad. I went to Tracey's birthday and had 3 bottles of beer. I know it was a school night and I promised myself that I wouldn't drink... but Tracey said that it was her birthday and instructed me to drink in celebration. Seeing as she is technically my superior -- not to mention the most lovely Senior Editor who edits such wonderful features -- I listened to her and had a couple of drinks. I managed to not dance on any tables, not spill beer on everyone in sight (spill/pour/spray... same diff), and held conversations. I can't remember what I did for Tracey's birthday last year, but i think it involved the previously mentioned activities.

      I always thought that I could never finish the meals at Mexican Radio because i was usually too drunk on margaritas to even keep my eyes open, but last night's dinner there with Maureen made me realize that I couldn't finish that stuff was because there's so much damn food on my plate. Anyway, no alcohol was consumed last night. None. None will be consumed tonight even though I'm going to Tracey's birthday party at SPINGSTREET... Diego Garcia, international sex god and father of many children, of the band Elefant, will be DJing. Friends have promised to hold my mouth open as they pour shots down my throat. I've got some pretty shitty friends.   Anyway, Jasper the Great has some photos on his site from the  urlLink stellastarr* afterparty . Here's a preview:       Electro Greg      Guilia and Audrey      The  worst  DJ in NYC     Also, I'm in love with  urlLink Laura Modernage ,   urlLink Melodynelson , and  urlLink Jasper .

      Last night at Shout!:  Greg: "Are you bored? You seem bored these days." Me: "I'm not bored. I'm just sober."  Saturday was a non-sober night for me. School nights=sobriety. non-school nights=non-sobriety. this is how it works. So on saturday after dinner with Sarah Wilson i met up with Raphael, Greg and Peruvian Nick at Tis Was... which is now Tis Wasn't or Tisn't. I think we should start a "save tis was" foundation. It used to be so much fun. I'm considering renaming this blog to "What the fuck happened to tis was?"  Oh, and I went to see American Wedding with Barry last night. So fucking hilarious that I think I embarassed Barry with my laughter. There's a new version of "Laid" in the movie, and since that's one of my all time favorite songs i was totally stoked.  Officially two weeks since i've changed my drinking habits... a trend started from the night this photo was taken:

      So I've driven the wagon right off the road, fallen off, and got lost somewhere in the gutter. I tell myself that I'm gonna only drink two drinks a night when I drink, but now i've instituted a new rule that I can only drink on the weekends, and drinking is what i'm doing... in full force. Last night I took one of the beers from stellastarr*s dressing room, it was glass and when i went downstairs to join my friends i was told that glass bottles werent allowed in the audience part of the venue. So there I stood for 3 minutes downing a bottle as fast as i could while talking to the beautiful Giulia. By the time I got to Manhatta (or whatever it's called), i was only one and a half beers in but already i was dancing on table tops and got the brilliant idea of shaking a bottle of Corona so that it'd squirt in every direction like an exploding champagne bottle. The patrons of the bar were stupid idiots (apart from the after party people), so i didnt mind dousing them in beer. Anyway... Barry didnt believe that I'd be so absolutely insane after only one beer, but i am actually totally nuts. My friend Jake swung by to celebrate the end of sobriety by buying me a lemon drop shot.   So in the end....  Total number of drinks: probably 5? 6? Total number of tables danced on: probably 5? 6? Total number of times i was threated to be thrown out: 2  Oh, and my brother Lawrence and my friend Adam went to the YYYs show and said it was awesome. I decided to skip out and give Lawrence my two tickets so he could find some cute girls at the ss* gig and take them. He was successful, yay.   Tonight I go over to Greg and Raphael's for the first time ever for some cheese and wine. This is code for: we're gonna do lines of blow off of the bodies of hookers. it's gonna be totally awesome.   Oh, i forgot to mention, stellastarr* were totally fucking amazing. I got great shots of them that maybe i'll figure out how to upload so i can pretend to be a blogger of the modernagemelodynelsonnewyorkdolljenykdivestar caliber. but not likely. Anyway, they were fucking awesome and i was so proud of them and i wanted to smoosh their faces and tell them that i love them and have their babies, but unfortunately i'm already pregnant with Diego Garcia's spawn (as is every woman who attended the elefant show last night). I'm naming the kid Moz Garcia. It will be born the child Morrissey wished he was.  Bottoms up sluts.

      OK, so last night it was August 1st at some point, so at some point i stepped gracefully off the wagon and had a couple of Caronas because 1. it was thursday and today is a summer friday which meant i wouldnt have to get back into work until monday. 2. Mr. Nicolson was a good 4 drinks ahead of me by the time I had a sip. Scottish people are given bottles of Jack and Coke the moment they're born. 3. I decided to handle my drinking in the most calmed down manner i could which meant not downing 4 drinks in 40 minutes.   I gotta say that when i woke up I was a little fuzzier than usual so i was able to see the absolute distinction between waking up after a totally sober night and waking up after a totally not sober night. I sort of appreciate learning this and will remember it next time i walk into a bar and think "OK, I would like to drink enough to jump up on a table and knock shit off."  For those whom would like to yell at me for cowering to pressure of Captain Morgan, please do so at slewitinn@spin.com, or AIM ultragrrrl ...   Right now it's thundering and i'd like to get off the internerd before i get zapped.

      OK, first thing's first: The birthday party on saturday isnt just for Elliot, but also for  urlLink Jo Divestar  and Sophie.   Speaking of Elliot, last night i went to that Fader party at the planetarium. I was shocked because the party was actually really great. It wasn't crowded, there was lots of free booze and cheese. I decided to keep it real and showed up munching on a veggie max from subway. I was told to put it away (which i did by shoving it in my mouth), but managed to keep my container of coke which i eventually filled with more coke and whiskey. It was watered down and diluted, so i didnt get drunk. I had a sip of this weird blue moon juice crap that tasted awful. I went into the light show thing expecting it to be super fucking cheesy but it was actually really great. I became incredibly nauseous after the 40 minutes of computer animation which included dancing, raving, glowstick-holding, heart shaped robots. The music was actually well chosen and the animation that goes with it was well done. I was super stoked to find out that an old friend from middle/high school was one of the people who worked on the animation. Hot shit!    Tim Sweeney and Gideon DJed. Tim was a fucking great DJ. Wow. It was like Bobbie Gillespie was spinning. Gideon's DJ skills have greatly improved from when we used to throw a party together. For one thing, he plays more recognizable tracks rather than the super obscure funk shit he used to be into, and apart from the fact that it takes me forever to get his attention (over the 30 seconds it took anyone else), he did a great job.   Anyway, back to the party. After the fucking light show roller coaster ride which literally made me feel like i was gonna hurl, I was happy to see solid ground. I danced a bit when GidRock played Joy Division. But that meant dancing alone, which is typical, but has grown tiresome.  At 11:30 we were all kicked out and so I rode my stupid bike 85 blocks home. Maybe more. I think more. It took me 40 minutes. When I rode my bike to the planetarium i thought it'd be a good idea to go via central park. Never again. The sun went down as i was riding and i couldnt find my way out. I took this unlit side road and totally thought i was either gonna get raped or crash right into a tree (i was riding very fast so i wouldnt get jumped and raped). Never fucking again. Never, never, never again. I hate it. I dont think i'll ride my bike again after last night. It's time for like, a car.

      The past two nights have been spent eating. I dont really remember going to Shul or getting dressed or anything about much -- but i remember the food. I'm glad that I eat meat again or else i wouldn't have been able to taste the sweet goodness of wadda-ednab (aka stuffed grape leaves) and stuffed onion.   Seeing everyone in my family (aunts, uncles, cousins, and people who are married to someone's husbands brothers and their kids), was surprisingly fun. My cousins, on both sides of my family, are fucking clever as shit and leave me speechless because I dont want to interrupt the course of action their normal thinking patterns usually go in. Usually the best jokes are those which are at someone elses expense, and in the case of my cousin Maurice, he made fun of everyone right to his faces on the dinner table while everyone became overwhelmed with laughter. Lizzy was my guest to one of the dinners last night (i had about 5 meals yesterday from 2pm-11pm), and she finally understood where i got my low brow humor from and why i'm not easily offended.   My family spent 15 minutes insulting Israelis as my uncle by marriage jokingly faught in defense of the little state he calls home. My family doesnt really hate israelis -- if they did, my aunt would've never been allowed to marry one -- they just like to point out what makes everyone different. And in this case, the thing that was different from Israelis and the rest of the world, is that Israelis would have a Bar-B-Q on Yom Kippur. Probably the only way you understand that sentance is if you are israeli, or deal with one on a fairly regular basis. I like israelis a lot. I think the men are super fucking hot and the women are as well. I've dated israelis. But one thing is that they're rude people. It's what makes them funny as fuck and wonderful to be around. No bullshit.  Anyway, I dont think i'ver ever laughed more in my entire life, and feel like referring that South Park episode again. I think that was the funniest night of my life, and i might never laugh again.  I didnt drink at all either -- well, except for a wee bit of wine. My aunt was offering us beers at her house at 1:30pm and was shocked that we all turned her down. I dont know, drinking at 1:30 in the pm just doesnt sound appealing. I think this proves that I'm not an alcoholic! At least not anymore. A true alcoholic would've been on that in a heartbeat and thought long and hard about how many more she'd be able to drink before leaving the house. I, however, was appalled by the idea of drinking. I'm a square now. It's true.  I'm gonna see Lost in Translation tonight with my roommates. I like Japanese culture and pointing out our differences. Time to eat again. mmmm...

      I'm DJing at Broadcast on October 2. I've been told that there will be drink specials and you can smoke in the roof garden (weather permitting).  Also, I'm DJing Elliot Aronow's birthday party at Lolita (corner of broome and allen streets) next Saturday.   And I've got new glasses that make me look like one of those porno-secretary people, whom, when they tear them off, the wakka wakka of the wawa pedal begins and in comes the dude with the 9inch penis to give me a progress report or something.

      Right. So today is the first day of Rosh Hashanah and so that means that tonight and tomorrow I'm in total Jew-mode -- which actually isn't any different than most days for me to be honest. I'm going to be eating a lot more oily food than usual, and since I don't drink as much anymore, I will be less crabby towards my family. Usually I'm able to handle about 3-5 hours of retardation from everyone, but once my body says "time for booze," I turn from Dr. Jekyl to Mr. Hyde and become really unpleasant towards my family saying "ugh..." a lot. But you know, to my credibilty, I can't say that it's not deserved.  Last night I went to my very first book reading, and thankfully it was of two people's whose work I really admire --  urlLink Marc Spitz  and  urlLink Chuck Klosterman . This was Marc's first book reading and he did a really amazing job. He was so nervous that it was really charming. I know that in about a month he will have the whole thing down pat and wont even break a sweat the next time he has to read an excerpt out of his book.  Chuck was so totally fucking awesome. Rather then read a bit of his book, he gave us all Cliff Notes on what to say when someone asks us if we've read his book. Things like "You can say that this chapter isn't very good. And with this chapter you can say that you thought it was ok, but my hatred of Coldplay is a bit too severe. And in this Zack Morris chapter, just say that you've never seen "Saved By the Bell" and you'll be ok." But everyone's seen "Saved by the Bell", so read Chuck's book  Sex, Drugs, and Coco Puffs .  After the book reading I headed home to meet up with  urlLink Nate  and Morgan for dinner and ran into  urlLink Vicki . She was having dinner at Cafe Louise down the block from our apartments and she said that she spotted Bjork heading into Schillers looking very  urlLink AsFour . Why, Bjork? Why? Why are you so pretentious? Can't you just not be? Your music is soo good. While I was standing on the corner with Vicki moaning over AsFour, Nate and Morgan passed me with their friend Sam and said that they didnt feel like getting dinner anymore, so I met up with  urlLink Brian  and we tried out our pretentious coats and had a small dinner. Brian knows every human in NYC and knew someone who hosts at Schillers, so we didnt have to wait for a table. I felt cool for a moment.   I ended up skipping out on the Nada Surf show that I had a ticket for. I was so tired by the end of dinner that I thought that my bed would make for a better show than the Nada Surf show. I mean, i fucking love their album but I've been to way too many shows lately, and i finally conceeded that I've seen the best show that I could possibly see, so every show following said show would be nothing but a let down. It sort of reminded me of this time i saw "South Park" and Cartman saw people's whose faces were made of asses and he declared the sight the funniest thing he'll ever see and couldn't laugh at anything anymore. This is sort of how I feel like after seeing that  urlLink British Sea Power  show at North Six this past summer which I attended with  urlLink Greg the boyfriend . I'm not sure something can move me the same way that show did... and so ever since, every show has been sort of a let down. Seriously.   By the way, last October i was in london and fell on my ass while leaving a tube and my friend Tom compared seeing that to the "South Park" episode mentioned above. He said it was the funniest thing he's ever seen and might not be able to laugh again. But then I fell once more and managed to prove him wrong. I can fall on command. It's my only talent.

      My head is really hurting. This afternoon I went to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked since i just bought a new pair of glasses. The whole thing -- glasses purchase, eye exam, lens fitting (i got the super thin type of lens since my eyes are so incredibly shitty and i'd have massively thick lenses otherwise) -- cost me nearly $500. I am hoping that a lot of that expense will be covered by my insurance, but hopes are sort of doubtful.  Anyway, last night I DJed Marc's book release party. I'm really proud of him for writing a novel, and even knocked $75 off my original asking price to DJ the event (hey, i was going to have to stand around for 3 hours playing songs while everyone was off having a good time, not to mention, i paid for my own drinks!). Anyway, the sound system at niagra is fucking shit. I looked like an asshole as the sound went from being too bassy to being too treble-y. Since I haven't had anything to drink since last thursday (as pointed out by some people who corrected me when i claimed having gone a week without booze... thanks Jason and Hal for being on top of those things we like to call "alcohol problems"), I spent the three+ hours nursing only two beers. Think about that... 2 months ago, three hours would've meant about six beers. I'm really making progress, if you ask me. But you haven't.   Anyway, Marc's party was fun, i think. I don't know. Everyone went into this super VIP private room that was away from where I was spinning, so I can't even be sure that the whole thing was as fabulous as I can hope. My friend Trish took photos of the night and put them into a little video with "Love Will Tear Us Apart" playing... she took about 40 pictures of my bizoobies.   I was kicked off the turntables an hour early and not because i sucked at what i was doing, but because there was a scheduling conflict and some band took to some small stage at 10pm. That's so lame, and I felt really bad for Marc who had to then have the fucking jukebox play DJ.  I made it an early night because I'm getting old. Jenny gave me a ride back to my house, but only after i fell into a puddle and totally wet my underwear, dress, and shoes. I'm so fucking graceful sometimes, it's just rediculous.

      BRMC are so fucking boring live. I saw them at Bar13 for the Shout! party a few months ago and that was awesome, but last night... I dont think I watched them for more then five minutes before wandering around looking for something more exciting. The highlight of their show was actually outside when Vicki and I were taking photos posing with motorcycles. I was hoping one of us would knock them down PeeWee Herman style, but nope. No dice.   Blimey Captain. Johnny Depp on the cover of the NME? link from  urlLink Laura .

      i want to go to an island where there are no bars, no birthday parties, no shows, and no things to go to. i want the only thing to go to is: ... sleep ... watch "queer eye" ... roll over and tan your back ... sleep.  it's like, things are really fun and there's nobody having more fun than us. but it's time we chill out for a bit. it's time we sat at home, chatted with our roommates, swooned about a boy, and just sat on friendster all day looking up old friends.

      I'm going to be DJing  urlLink Marc Spitz's  book release party on Wednesday. He wrote this amazing novel called  How Soon is Never? , which is technically ficticious but based on the actual time he and Vicki tried to reunite the Smiths.  It's really good.  The party starts at 8pm and will be at Niagra, but downstairs. I'm gonna be DJing only stuff that Morrissey and Marr would've been listening to if they turned the radio on while hanging out  together. Does that make any sense?

      I forgot, last night at the Hole, some guy came up to me that recognized me from Friendster. I think his name was Matt Martin. I forget how we were connected. But anyway, I had taken melatonin about 3 hours ealier because i thought i was gonna sleep, and then when i got called to go out i had to down some redbull so i was a bit stoned. If you happen to read this, sorry i didnt friendster you like i said i would.

      I haven't posted in a while, and I haven no idea whatsoever why I haven't.  Wednesday: Went to see the Bronx and the Distillers at Bowery. Then cabbed it up to meet Sarah Wilson at the Thursday show, which was beyond amazing and wonderful and yes, I love emo, screamo, extremo, whatever you want to call it. Sarah Wilson loved it so much that when we arrived at the Radio4 show across town she said "I have to go. I just experienced something so real in that Thursday show, and this crowd is all so fake." I couldn't really disagree with her all that much, i mean, save for my friends that were there.   I'd like to say that RedBull is the most amazing thing I've ever drank in my life. Me and Stephen each drank two cans on our way out for the night and I was totally awake, motivated, and feeling wonderful the whole night. I'm glad I found RedBull before the thought of white lines keeping me awake became something I wasn't scared shitless of. I love you RedBull. TLF!  Thursday: I went to see the Darkness after dinner with Lizzy, Jenny, and Rob. Apart from the show being totally fucking awesome, i got to see Vicki. I haven't seen her in so long that the reunion with her was more exciting than anything happening on the stage 4 feet from us. I also got to hang out with Gideon for a bit which was nice because I haven't seen him in ages and he and I used to be inseperable. I hardly recognized him when I saw him. After the show everyone headed down to Lit to party the night away. At 3:30am Stephen and I were ready to call it quits when while hailing a cab he said "Want to go to the Popbitch party?" which we did. After the party, we -- along with Meg and Julia -- headed up to some random hotel room that was apparently having a party. When we arrived there was a guy at a desk, four people on a bed -- two couples -- and a gigantic platter of cocaine in between them. It was like a scene out of Pulp Fiction, only more depressing. I sat on the floor talking to the people I came with and nearly started a fight with some woman who had her boobs hanging out of her dress because she made some snide comment to one of my friends. The saddest thing was that everyone (apart from the people i arrived with) in the room was totally so off their tits that they could hardly keep their eyes open. Of the original five in the room, the one that was actually quite cool was the one whose room it belonged to. Unfortunately, he'll have to remain nameless.  After a half hour my mind suddenly freaked out. I was having a mini panic attack watching these drunk and incredibly high couples kiss and touch each other. I told Stephen that i was getting sick and needed to leave immediately, which we did. I want to erase the image of that night out of my head forever, but unfortunatley, I think it's there permanantly. It's like how in 2nd grade your teacher says that if you get detention 5 times it ends up on your permanant record -- which is a sort of training for when you fear you're going to get bad credit -- that night is on my permanant memory record.   Friday: A very sad day for NYC. It's new son, Stephen, bid his farewells and stepped onto a plane headed back to London. It's safe to say that he made quite the impression on everyone in this city during his three week stay and will be missed. No longer is he a man with a nickname in the stories i tell, but now, simply Stephen Jones. However, he's more than welcome to pick up any of the nicknames he's aquired during the two years I've known him... most of which are too incriminating to actually write about.  Saturday: The boyfriends called at 1am demanding I return to them. So I met up with them at Pianos and then we headed over to the Hole. I haven't seen the boys in what feels like ages, so it was really nice to be able to just stand around hugging them and catching up on things that we sort of don't need to catch up on (work). I got to meet Raphael's friend Charly, who was really cute and reminded me of Molly Ringwald. On our way to the Hole, Greg and I found baby shoes and stuck them in my bike's basket. I took them out when I left the Hole since they were still there. There's really no reason for me to talk about that, but it was just amusing to me that there was a pair of baby shoes lying around on the street. In anycase, I returned home at 3:30am after the bartender at the Hole ... i think his name was Jason ... gave me shit for drinking only water.  Whoa, you know what? I think i drank a maximum of half a drink during these past four days. Even today at brunch with Lance I stayed away from the special sauce. OK, so RedBull has replaced Alcohol in my list of addictions, but at least it wont make me bloated and fat.

      When you're sitting at your desk and growling, it's probably not a good sign. I'm so tired. I dont want to go out at night but I find myself trying really hard to keep my eyes open and my mouth smiling. Despite the endless streams of beer from Mr. Jones (it was a drinking night people), I found myself being very sleepy, and according to sources, in a slightly sour and abusive mood (sorry). The night started off at Sin-e for the Viscious Party where i was reunited with a few friends that I hadn't seen in a while... not to mention the regular crowd of hungry hungry hipsters who loitered out front looking and being fabulous.   I headed to see the Adam Green show and I predict that he'll be the next Beck. I remember seeing Beck when I was 14 and I got the same sense from this show as I did on October 17, 1994. Not to mention, his song about Jessica Simpson -- "Jessica" -- is absolutely fucking amazing.  From there I went to SPINGSTREET for the YES!SELECTOR party where I guess !!! and TV On Radio were DJing, but I'm not really sure. They weren't very good and prompted Eve and I to do that cheesy head bopping dance. I drank a lot tho. A lot. I lost count. I never got drunk but I was very sleepy in the cab, however, incredibly hyper once I got home and in bed. I need to keep a boxing glove by my bed so that next time i'm being hyper i can punch myself in head with it. A Pavlovian reaction will eventually happen and I'll just sleep when i see my bed. Apart from when I'm hyper while trying to sleep, why the fuck am i so sleepy all the time. Maybe I have mono? Maybe i'm bored. Maybe the drugs don't like me.

      I got  urlLink this link  from  urlLink Glamorama-online :    The weekend was great. Me and Stephen went to Brent and Karen's wedding at the Frying Pan. Got to see a lot of people I hadn't seen in ages, including my old boss, Michael Hirschorn, from VH1... he is so awesome. I guess I was exhausted and indulged in the whole "it's not a school night!" thing and had one or two many glasses of the wine. Stephen and I started telling people that we were engaged (mostly for greencard purposes) and I held up a very gigantic faux diamond ring and claimed it as my engagement ring. Nobody batted an eyelash. When Stephen and I headed back home I pretty much fell asleep in the taxi. I guess that long chat with Vivian that we had took a toll on our partying.  Saturday we went to visit my poor friend Anthony in South Jersey for a few hours. Ant broke his collar bone and pelvis bone while riding a motorcycle very fast. He looked great despite the definite internal injury. I managed to not ask him to give me some of his meds. I must say: i'm sort of proud of my restraint. After missing our 9:20 bus back home, we went to see "Pirates of the Carribean" and had to leave during the last 2 minutes as to avoid missing another bus. So if anyone can tell me what happens at the very end, i'd be stoked.  Sunday=Trivial Pursuit with the roommates. Cartoon Tea. Friendhouse Sushi. Carona (oops! forgot it was a sunday)! and the very boring Dandy Warhols show followed by passing out.   So, not exactly what i'd call a "progressive" weekend in "avoiding the sauce"... but one step at a time. Last time i counted there were 12 steps. I'm like, on 2. Back off brothers. Stop threatening the rehab!

      So sad about  Johnny Cash  and  John Ritter . So very sad.   Sia came up to me this morning saying i was psychic "First you said that gay's were big, and Britney and Madonna kissed. Then you said we should write a Johnny Cash obit, and the today he's dead."   I predict that tonight I go to a wedding.  The new Strokes album has hit our offices. I want to dance a little bit but I also would rather be listening to the new Interpol album. However, i gotta say, Fabrizio's drumming is fucking great.  No drinking last night. No drinking on wednesday night. Tonight is not a school night and the parent's are in Florida... what's up biatch?

      I was sitting in my brother's apt, talking with my friends via the internet (forget about using the phone... that wasnt possible), making sure everyone was ok and freaking out to no end while watching cnn. It was a week after then that i was like "i must live life as if tomorrow is my last." and so the alcohol/party/losing the plot problem began. I've had fun. But tomorrow wont be my last day alive, so it's time to put the drink down. Time to go to bed before 4am. Time to chill the fuck out.   Right. So anyway, last night i went to see Jet and 22-20s. Both were really great. I've seen Jet before, and I didnt like them, but last night I had such a great time. I dont know if it's only because of the gigantic british man infront of me who was the closest thing a guy like him could be to being a 22-20s groupie, or if i actually liked their songs (one of Jet's songs sounded exactly like "Lust for Life" by Iggy, and I kept on thinking that they were going to start playing it so i could run around the audience like Renton being chased from the cops...). Instead I just bounced around, getting sweaty, and screaming. I managed to not drink a drop of ze ol' booze last night. Despite being pressured into drinking by one of my friends, i managed to stay away. Leave me alone you fucking barley or whatever the fuck it is that makes you make me be the way i get. Needless to say, this morning on my way to work i started plotting for the weekend... a bottle of your finest pinkest wine, please.  Oh, and my egg&cheese on a roll had an after taste of bacon. Fucking hell that's nasty. How do you people eat that? I haven't had to puke so badly since... since... since saturday night when i lost the plot.  Today I'm going to voluenteer at a soup kitchen. If i ever leave the office. Should be fun. I like people.

      Last night was a very dizzy night for me. First i made it down to the   urlLink Kill Hannah   show. They were amazing as per usual. I saw   urlLink Julia   and   urlLink Megan   there, they were excited about it being a tuesday night and were looking forward to seeing me drunk and dancing on tables (which i did)... Then I went home to regroup, get changed, and eat a bit with   urlLink Nate the Roommate  . The fucking  urlLink   OC    pulled me in like a line of vicodin that just wont quit. However, halfway through   urlLink Lawrence   called me saying that i had to come down to the  urlLink  stellastarr*   show at that moment because they were getting on stage and i had his ticket. So i rode my bike over in my dress and the motherfucking bike ripped my motherfucking dress and then i forgot my motherfucking bike lock. I was pissed. Not to mention i had to interview  Ben Lee  about a half hour later, so i said fuck it and went home. interviewed Ben, and headed over to SPRINGSTREET.   Yes!Selector  is really fun -- I go almost every week to support  DJ Jesus  -- and i was really happy to be there with   urlLink Greg   and   urlLink Lizzy   and her teacher/boss  Kate ... but my head started to go dizzy from over stimulation and people. I love everyone. i do. but sometimes i get dizzy and annoyed when i cant get from one end of the room to the other. I did get to see a bunch of my favorite people... which is typically everyone that has a pulse. I danced on the tables with Megan. I got totally and utterly molested by  Mat Devine  and  Greg Corner . Like felt up from every angle as if they all had arms like octopi. They claim they were tickling me... which is what you would say if you're some perverted uncle, right? Which is fine, cause those boys are like my brothers, however, my brother would never do that. Got good quotes from  Carlos , some guy named  Chris from Jet  (all for my spin box/column thing), and got great photos. I attempted to speak to the guy from the  Kings of Leon  outside as i was trying to hail a taxi, but i was drawn into the black hole of his hair and couldnt hear a word he said.   I feel like last night didnt happen to me. It was such a blur and a whirlwind and a confusion of senses that it was like something out of a really trippy movie out of england about the rave drug culture or something. only, minus the dancing.

      So by now, everyone knows that I really love Linkin Park. I had no idea that so many people watched MTV2 over the weekend, but apparently their ratings must've been pretty fucking high since i got hounded at the  urlLink stellastarr*  show about my taste in music (I think i try everything possible to ruin my credibility... and i might've won this time). Yes, I love Linkin Park. Yes, their  Hybrid Theory  was one of my favorite albums (however, i haven't listened to the new one really at all). Yes, they're one of my favorite bands... but no, i don't think they're one of the best bands of all time. I just like them. I don't know why, but I do.   Tonight Iann will be my date for a long, long, long night of whoa. Starting off with  urlLink Kill Hannah  at  urlLink Mercury Lounge , then The Hong Kong, stellastarr*, and Ravonettes at Bowery, followed by Yes!Selector at SPRINGSTREET featuring Jarvis Cocker,  urlLink Carlos De. , and Sume Ravonettes. Oh dear. It's one of my drink nights, but since i have to work -- my spin stuff -- i will probably be sober. However, whenever Mat Devine is in the room, there is no staying sober whatsoever. Nope. No way. No how. Oh dear.  This is Mat. Go swoon at him at 7pm at Mercury Lounge. His band is called Kill Hannah. I love them like i love the nightlife.

      Even though I wasn't home on Friday night because of Shabbat, there was still mayhem in good old Apartment 3A thanks to the newest member, Nate. Oh, Nate. You're great.  Tim was staying over and was going to crash on my couch or the inflatable bed, but when he came home at 5:30am he found one of Nate's friends asleep on the airmattress. So he went into my room to crash on the couch and found a boy -- Lizzy's brother -- already occupying that space. So he went into the main bathroom to collect his thoughts and found Nate passed out on the bathroom floor. So then he started walking over to my bathroom and Nate's friend pushed right passed him and stayed in the bathroom for about an hour -- presumably she passed out -- and so Tim was forced to sleep in my bed... which had no sheets because they were going to the wash. So he had to put the papazon cushion on top of the bed and passed out there. Lovely.   Saturday, when i finally returned home after a baby shower, I found myself host to a party in my room. The door was endlessly revolving with people, and so at some point it was me, Tim, Robert from the Music, his brother, Nate, his friend, my brother, Lizzy and Niki. We sat around eating McDonalds, Zen Palate, and drinking beers and then headed over to see My Morning Jacket. Despite drinking tea earlier that night, i just wasn't feeling it. The sound of the music was just amazing, but watching the band just gave me nightmares. So I rounded the troops up again and added Sarah Wilson and Kate Golden for good measure. When we got back to the house where i could play the Adam Green "Jessica" song over and over again, we all started to hear Robert singing from Lizzy's room. He was playing this new song he had written that was just so utterly amazing. I nearly collapsed. My heart was beating so quickly... his voice is just so powerful and stunning and the song -- a ballad -- just knocked me over. The looks on everyone's face in the room was just of total shock. It's gonna be surreal to hear that song finally recorded... and I regret not videoing it myself.  So after that stunning performance we all had some more beers (Lawrence claims to have counted me drinking 3 beers... which he wasn't very happy about... and he wasn't too keen on the vike either), and headed over to Lit for some dancing. I met up with the boyfriends, riled up the crowd, and when i attempted to go home at 4am I got kidnapped by Tim and SiouxZ and we ended up at her apt til 7am picking up where we left off at my apt... which was basically more beer and more music being played. I came home and while talking to Tim i had to excuse myself mid-sentence to empty the beer from inside me. It sucks coming back up. It's not that good going down, even. I woke up at 4pm on sunday.   Anyway, I've derailed from sobriety. Not because i've got a problem. I don't. The brother's think I might, but the reality of the situation is that I don't. I drink because rock and roll etiquette dictates that you must. However, to appease them, I will go back to my prior routine of no alcohol on a school night (except for tuesdays). It's either this or them forcing me into rehab, and well, I've got too many shows and parties to attend for rehab to get in the way.

      Greg (of Greg and Raphael - the boyfriends) is a genius. Here is an IM we had:    Greg : I have a theory that no one listens to the new Radiohead.  Can you prove me wrong?  Ultragrrrl : no.   Greg : Everyone gave it good reviews, but I think it was all a false sense of appreciation.  Like ex's you can't shake.  Like dead pets that you'll always love.  And when I ask people, they get all defensive, then I ask "when was the last time" and people always give this "just the other day" lie.   Marc Sptiz is also a genius. He's on funny mode today. Apparently Adam Ant is remaking "Stand and Deliver" to be "Save the Gorilla." Here's an IM about the whole thing:   Ultragrrrl : WHAT THE FUCK is a dandy highway man?  Marc : someone who dresses like a pirate and robs you on the motorway  Marc : and then fucks you in the rump  Marc : and now, saves gorillas, apparently  Neither one of these men are sober people. Both of these men look strangely alike. Both of them i love dearly.

      Today I re-enter sobriety. I hope that I do it right. This "no drinking on school nights" fell by the way side with my multiple vistors from the UK. I don't like drinking. I dont even get drunk anymore. It's just a waste of money. So God, protect me from these demons we call booze (only on "school nights" and this doesn't include Tuesdays, tho, I think it wouldnt hurt to NOT drink on Tuesdays). Protect me from all that is wrong on this earth. Save me.

      It's cause I haven't been sober enough to get behind a keyboard and type type away. I'd love to recap, but that would require remembering things. I recall my reunion with Greg and Raphael... it was like something out of a movie. I missed my boyfriends very much. We've all been busy, or broke, or domestic, but there is no safe dancefloor in nyc once Pulp is played. My apartment is also a hotel. Sarah has sadly moved out. Millions have moved in. I think i had a party before motherfucker the other night. I know there were a lot of bodies in my room. A lot of beer consumed. A lot of DJing fights. I danced on tables at some point this weekend... but i never got TOTALLY drunk. I always had control. I miss losing control. I cant get to that point anymore, and well, to be honest, I sort of miss it. However, I'm sure the people around me are totally psyched that they dont have to deal with my off key singing of "Please, Please, Please Let me Get What I Want," however, they do have to deal with me being a total psychopath... but that's my M.O.

      I just got a Placebo cover album. It's not of bands covering Placebo, but rather, of Placebo covering bands. Here's what's on it:  they cover: "running up that hill" by kate bush; "where is my mind" by the pixies; "big mouth strikes again" by the smiths; "Johnny and Mary" by robert palmer; "20th century boy" by t rex; "the ballad of melody nelson" by serge gainsbourge; "holocaust" by alex chilton; "I feel you" by depeche mode; "daddy cool" by ?; "jackie" by sinead o'connor   My favorite covers so far are the ones of Kate Bush and the Smiths.  Last night I DJed a VH1 party for "I Love the 80s Strikes Back." I had several people asking me if I was still sober -- evidently not -- and offering me drinks. Drank two. Flirted with the waitstaff. Wondered if they're gay. Ate. Lugged about 50 lbs of records and cds on the subway and bus because i only had a $1.50 in quarters to my name.   It rained on me and now my hair is curley!

      Last night Marc invited me to DJ with him at the book release party for Rocco -- the guy the show  The Restaurant  is circled around. Marc didn't want me to DJ "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice, but I forced him to let me by giving him another glass of red wine. I downed 4 glasses of champagne... maybe five, and spun the classics... like... you know, stuff.  Whoa. London in less than a week.

I was told that the entire band is a bunch of choir boys with good hair... in other words: they're all  urlLink virgins . This is great news. I think I could love a virgin.

      I am feeling like such shit this morning. My body is like "hey, fuck you, bitch." I didn't really drink all that much yesterday (I think a shot of tequila followed by a frozen margarita with an extra shot thrown in to calm my nerves), but my body is feeling the pains. I stayed out past 4am, which was a really nice thing to do again -- but mostly because it's something I hadn't done in ages, and was unsure that i was actually capable of.  I started the night off at the Virgin Mega store to see stellastarr* perform. Met up with the usual suspects after the show and together we ran off to see British Sea Power at the Rough Trade night at Bowery. I was SUPER dissapointed that they didnt play "Blackout" but probably not as upset as Scott the singer who told me afterwards that he hasn't been so angry in three years. Apparently he thought the sound was total shit... but from where I was standing (which was upfront against the stage and center), it sounded so fucking hot. Not as good as the first time i saw them at North Six, but great none-the-less.  Kiran and I then went to get some Pizza at Rosario's and while i was there my friend Rob from Island Records called me to say that he had  just  signed the Killers and that they were all coming to the SPIN party to celebrate. So Kiran and I ate up and headed over there where I got to meet up with the boyfriends! I haven't seen the boyfriends in ages and i miss them so much. Greg cut his hair and was wearing this amazing coat and the whole hair-coat ensemble gave me a hard-on. I'm so psyched about going to London with him. Yay! Raphael looked fucking awesome as well. Lovely shirt-tie combo. Word. I have hot boyfriends.   The SPIN party was a fucking nut house. Packed with drunks who were slurring their every word to me. I danced on some tables because that's what i do.... but it took me a while to get to that point and spent the first 20 minutes sitting in fetus position and telling everyone who called "fuck, i can't help you, it's so crowded up here, fuck, i'm sorry, shit, i know you're my brother, but i dont know what to do, please forgive me, fuck". The Killers showed up and i went outside to meet up with them and my brother -- who were all waiting in line to get in. I decided that it was nicer outside than inside so we all went to the Hat to chill out for a bit... but everyone who met my brother said "whoa, you two look so much alike!" Yes. I look like a boy. With tits. That's fine. Anyway, this entry is getting really long. Let me wrap it up.  A new friend asked mine if i was more of a flirt when i was a drunk. The answer is yes.  I was. I was the definition of flirt. I think he sort of assumed this when people kept on coming up to me while i was sitting with him and saying "remember when you were making out with so and so and then...?" or "i saw you on Brian's website -- you posed with his balls and he stuck his face in your rack!" you know, the normal shit like that. But alas, sobriety -- or an attempt at it -- has brought me a new found sense of modesty (at least in the making out dept).   My stomach feels like such shit. Ugh. I hate what happens to you the morning after you've been drinking. It's not fun. My belly feels like exploding.  Oh, i saw Carlos last night. I think he's sort of excited that i'm gonna dress up as him for Halloween but pretending not to be. He said that he'd dress up like me, but he doesn't own jeans or sneakers. Diego Garcia told me that he's in love with some mexican model and i accused him of being a modelizer. He's crazy, that Diego, but i like him. I adore Carlos tho. If he and i had kids one day, they'd look EXACTLY like Brian Molko.  I'm gonna crawl back in bed for a bit and curse the sunlight.

      First off: The new  urlLink stellastarr*  is amazing. You can watch it on  urlLink Melody Nelson . It's really, really, honestly amazing. I suggest watching the windows media player version cause the real audio one don't wanna work.   Now back to our regular scheduled "me" fest:  Lastnight began the weeklong-ish festivities of the  urlLink CMJ Music festival . It was kicked off by a huge club night thrown for America's favorite sub-genre: Emo by the Syndicate. My friend Andy Greenwald (aka DJ No Emo No Cry), was the first DJ of the night... which meant that nobody was drunk enough to dance despite the fucking killer music he was playing. I saw this and ran onto the dance floor and tried out my favorite Britney dance moves with Chris Ryan which involved a failed attempt to do this split then backwards rollover into a head stand move...but ended up just hurting my back really badly. I wish i could say i made that up (that i actually acted that retarded out in public WHILE SOBER, but i can't). At least my embarkment onto the dancefloor prompted everyone else in the club to join -- i guess they figured they'd HAVE to look cooler than me.  I'm seeing  urlLink the Killers  tonight! Last night my friend took me to meet them and this evening i'll be getting dinner with them. I'm really looking forward to seeing them play. I sort of got into a fight with the singer because he doesn't exactly feel the same way i do about the greatest band in the world,  urlLink Interpol , and I'm just about Interpol's #1 fan. Speaking of Interpol, i saw them last night in concert and their news songs made my heart beat in my pants. Holy fucking shit.   Drink tally: I think 2. I had a beer and a stoli orange with grapefruit and cranberry. My friend Jen seemed to know what this drink was called but i'm at a loss.  Tonight, my liver and i are in a fight.

      I like the new  urlLink Cooper Temple Clause  album a lot, especially the songs called "The Same Mistakes" and "Blind Pilots." Ooof! The singer sounds a lot like Liam and they've all got great hair. Shallow observation, yes, but look at them!    I'm also in love with this band called  urlLink Murder by Death . They sound like  urlLink the Coral  playing New Orleans funeral music.

      My new favorite drink is stoli orange vodka with grapefruit and cranberry juice. Last night I had four more. I was totally stoked. I went to see Metric and was dancing up a storm -- so much so i guess that the singer told me from stage that i was making her night and inspiring her to dance.   I guess she didn’t see me earlier in the evening at Julie Pietrangelo's karaoke birthday party where I got the party started by singing an absolutely off key version of JT's "Like I Love You." It included me dancing, climbing on furniture, and falling on my ass while trying to show Julie just how limber i can be -- which is apparently, not very.  Out of nowhere a guy that nobody in the party knew started singing Christina’s “Beautiful” and were all shocked by how awesome his voice was. I had to take a photo of him, and it’s definitely the best photo I’ve ever taken of someone in my life. I’ve never seen a smile that big!     if that doesn’t work,  urlLink click here.   I should detox this weekend, but I totally forgot how much fun it is to get wasted. It’s like I’ve got my second wind back!

      I'm just a social drinker with a really active social calendar.  My friend Marti sent this to me:  AQUARIUS   Drinking Style Aquarius and drinking don't go together that well (except for water, that is). They have an innate tendency toward know-it-allism, and if they get an idea while sizzled, they're more stubborn than a stain or a stone. If they're throwing a party or organizing an outing, however, they're too preoccupied with their duties to get combative -- and they make perfectly charming drunks in that case. Fortunately, they're usually capital drink-nursers. They also make the best designated drivers (if you can get them before they start raising their wrist): Aquarius is fascinated by drunk people and capable of holding interesting conversations with soused strangers while sober.  Trademark Cocktails Aquarius is likely to order stuff most people have never heard of: a capirinha, Satan's whiskers, a negroni, an Arthur Tompkins. They like to stump the bartender. This sign rules the color electric blue and would be pleased by any tipple featuring blue curacao. They also rule the olive tree, so pour the juice into that dirty martini.  Drinking Buddies Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Dre, Matt Groening, Ashton Kutcher, Ronald Reagan, Christina Ricci, Justin Timberlake, Oprah Winfrey, Elijah Wood  ------ Oh, and I like  Hail to the Thief  now. Caryn found joy in pointing her finger at me and saying "I told you so!"

      Last night I DJ'ed at Pianos for some fashion party that had this band called Laptop playing. Laptop were pretty fucking great... the singer's voice reminded me of that gothtronica dude Wolfstein (sp?). The band was made up of all women who were decked out and looking like models and being totally Robert Palmer. Anyway, this isnt important.  What is important is that there was an open bar for Stoli vodka and I double fisted until my speech was slurred. It was literally slurred. I didnt feel totally drunk, just super fucking happy -- but i was drunk. I'm gonna admit it. By the time I got off DJ duty it was after 11. So I rode my bike home and dropped off my records and was planning to head over to HiFi for  urlLink Andy Greenwald's  book release party, but i wasnt sure if it was still going on and Lizzy was worried about me riding my bike while drunk. Last time I did that was after Primal Scream and I turned up at some party gushing blood from a fall and totally oblivious to that fact.  I like Kelly Clarkson's jeans in her new video. She and i have the same "thickness" issues. I should raid her closet. I bought a pair of Diesel jeans the other day but i think i'm gonna return them. Diesels look so fucking cool on men, it's retarded... but on me, i look retarded.  I missed Interpol last night. This makes me really sad. So the tally of great shows I've missed this week is three. Radiohead, Sigur Ros, and Interpol. I did get to see Thursday do an acoustic set at the Apple store last night. That was cool... but it wasnt Interpol. I heard that at the Interpol show, various members of the band actually went into the crowd and had sex with the audience members! DURING THE SHOW. that's how good it was. I'm trying to remind myself that I've seen Interpol 30+ times since 2000... including one evening when they came into SPIN.com offices to record something for our website and I couldnt convince anyone from the office to join me so it was like, me, interpol, and 3 others watching them perform songs. I gave birth right on the spot. it was cool.

      I just found out TODAY that I was on the guestlist for the  urlLink Sigur Ros / urlLink Radiohead  rehearsal show LAST NIGHT.  Oh my God. I want to sit in the corner and mainline Oxycontin to get over this heartbreak. Thank God tonight isn't a sober night, and thank God I have about 2 birthday parties to attend ( urlLink jasper  and lara), 1 show ( urlLink the prosaics ), and a party at my house that Nate is throwing for his Tampa dudes -- he's cooking. I can get drunk and drown my misery in my booze. FUCKING RADIOHEAD AND SIGUR ROS ON THE SAME STAGE MOMENTS AFTER EACH OTHER AND I MISSED IT AND I WAS ON THE FUCKING GUEST LIST  WITH A FUCKING PLUS ONE! .   I could've invited the hottest guy i know to that show and he'd be legally obligated by the laws of Rock and Roll to be the best lay of my entire life. Not that I'd want that ... but i'm just  saying ! Oh, and not that I'd need a Radiohead/Sigur Ros ticket to get laid... I'm just sayin... Cause i would've ended up taking Daniel the Orthodox Jew anyway. ORTHODOX JEW.  While on the topic,  urlLink fark.com ,  urlLink freep.com , and  urlLink bust.com  have listed me as their pick of the day. I set up that profile as a social experiment when I did a piece for SPIN called "Rock Star Personals." yes... it was a social experiment.  speaking of experiments...  HOLY SHIT!  urlLink MONKEYS CONTROL ROBOTS WITH THEIR BRAINS!  Article from the Washington Post.

      Last night, by some act of God, I found myself watching the "Wade Robson Project" where I got to hear the new  JC Chasez  song and holy shit it was so fucking amazing. He played two songs last night, and it was the second one he played. It's sound was in the dead center of Fischerspooner and the Faint and I think my jaw is feeling slightly dislocated from dropping to the floor in disbelief.   It's so fucking good. So loud and agressive and dirty sounding. The lyrics for the chorus totally rip off Korn and go: "All day i dream about sex, and all night i dream about sex, and all the time i dream about sex with you."  Maybe i was just super high or something, but it was so fucking good. I need to download that song now so i can DJ it on wednesday.

      According to sitemeter or something, nobody reads my blog. Which is great! This means that I don't have to worry about censoring myself and worrying that my brothers might read about what i've really been doing with my nights and ship me off to rehab. Perhaps I've installed my sitemeter thing incorrectly, which is possible.  Sadly, I haven't been doing much. I come home at nights and crawl into bed after having a smoke.  Friday night totally ruled my pants tho. I went to see Radiohead at MSG and the motherfuckers played "Creep"... which i'm not embarassed to say is my second favorite RH song (the best rh song is "Let Down"). I spent the entire time jumping up and down and up and down wanting to dry hump the person standing next to me cause i was so stoked that they were playing that song. Vicki and Alex finally arrived and I chilled a bit and experienced Radiohead the way God intended me to. I FUCKING ENJOY RADIOHEAD LIVE. I love them live like way too much. When I'm at their show I forget about  Hail to the Kid Amnesiac  and I just remember why I fucking love that band.  Hail to the Kid Amnesiac  songs make my nipples go stiff when they're played live. I'm a fucking loser.  After the show I went to the after party with Vicki and Alex and we had a fucking great time. Colin Greenwood seemed as interested in meeting me as he would be about getting Genital Warts or something. I dont really blame him. He played party host and had a lot of people to say hello to. So many people were pulling and poking at him that I probably would've been like "yes, nice to meet you" and run off as well if I were him. I did have a nice conversation or 4 with members of Sigur Ros (including Jonsi the singer!). I didnt see Thom there, but Alex swears he saw him. I nearly tripped over Ed O'Brien when i was leaving. It might be hard to trip over someone who is clearly a foot and half taller then me, but i should point out that it was an open bar.  Saturday I went shopping with Vicki and then went home to watch Justin Timberlake on SNL before passing out.  Sunday I discovered my new favorite activity: Dog Runs.  urlLink Brian  and I went to two of them and saw lots of dogs humping each other, and playing fetch, and chasing each other. Dogs fucking rule.  One last thing:  urlLink RIP THE MODERN AGE

      I'm not a "writer" as much as I "chronicle pop culture." I think there have been some misunderstandings about this.  Also, I drank heavily at the ELLEgirl party and Michelle Branch is very sweet. I didnt get drunk, but i did get rowdy. Brian nearly got punched in the face when I stared yelling at a couple who were making out in Chelsea (a boy and girl mind you!). I yelled "Wooo! Make out City!!!" Moments later my back started to give in and I had to call it a night. For whatever reason, I can't have coke (the soda kind) after i've had a beer, and i cant have mix drinks after i've had a soda type of drink. I have no idea why, but my back gets in such massive amounts of intolerable pain.   When i burp I feel better, but sometimes, that doesn't cut it.  Tonight I see Radiohead.

Also, someone at work thought i was 26. I am now about to crawl into a hole and cry. Where is that bottle of wine? 26 isn't old, but c'mon, why you aging me 3 years premature?

       urlLink Radiohead . I love Radiohead. But more, I love old Radiohead. New Radiohead makes me question myself. Do I like those albums because they're good albums or do I like them because Radiohead made them? If Radiohead came out with an album that was like  urlLink Muse's   Absolution , or  urlLink Coldplay's   A Rush Of Blood to the Head , or  urlLink Interpol's   Turn On the Bright Lights , or even  urlLink the Walkmen's   Everyone Who Pretended to Love Me Is Gone , people in the music industry would be allowed to take the day off of work so they could spend the day patting themselves on the back while listening to the opus.

       urlLink " target="_blank">Laura is a scenester.  I love Laura like a fat kid hates dieting. The funny thing is that the girl never leaves the house, so it seems.   I DJed the birthday party which was really fun. I drank a bit, which was uneventful seeing as I didn't get drunk and instead opted to leave the party at about 2am in favor of my bed. I atoned for my sins on sunday and monday, which was actually quite easy save for my brilliant idea to each Tostidos before sunset and NOT drinking a gallon of water to combat impending thirst. You can't even drink water when you're fasting for Yom Kippur and so i spent a lot of the time trying to savor my own spit. I'm sure that this is an appetizing image to anyone reading. I did fast for two extra hours than I had to... It's been a sinful year, I should've gone for another day. Needless to say, I haven't had much of an appetite since.  Monday night Brian --  urlLink equipped with an updated site that is beyond funny  -- took me to do Kareoke at Nolita Tavern on Spring Street. Brian is the best Kareoke person ever. He sang Bon Jovi's "Shot Through the Heart" and managed to get the entire audience cheering and dancing while waving their arms in the air. He convinced me to give it a try and so I sang "All the things She Said" by TATU.... while sober. During the verses I was shivering. I get so fucking stage fright it's unreal. I'm scared of two things indefinitely:  1. Guns. I don't like to be near them, but at the same time, I'd love to shoot one one day.  2. The Stage. Maybe when I'm drunk i'm ok on stage, but sober, it's like you might as well point a gun to my head. I wasn't always like this, and know exactly when the fear was set: In middle school (tenafly middle school in NJ to be exact), I performed in the orchestra where I played cello. The stage was so fucking packed during the performance that i was seated all the way on the outskirts and had to face away from the audience in order to see the conductor, so my unfortunately back was to the audience. I didn't think that was such a big deal until I found out the next day that Mr. Schneider had made fun of me to every one of his classes saying that I looked totally ridiculous with my back to the audience. From that moment on I became stage freight. I hate that man.  Last night I had a really nice dinner with Vicki and then went to Brooklyn to wish Phoebe a Happy Birthday.  Today I got the new Britney Spears single. She looks like she had a nose job. Tonight I party with Michelle Branch courtesy of ELLEgirl. We will do loads of heroin because that's the cool thing to do these days.

      I finally got closer to drunk than i've been in ages, which felt really wonderful and so i'm sort of enjoying this hangover right now and nursing it with a coke and buttered bagel.   Anyway, getting a bit drunk last night was great. someone handed me a bottle of beer and the first thing i did was shake it up and hold it above my head as the beer squirted all over and i nearly got kicked out. I had so much fun DJing at Broadcast. I haven't had fun like that in ages and it just felt like so much fun to DJ to a full room and to act retarded and make mistakes and dance around and not be tired. I think I'm getting back to square one with all this sobriety. Getting drunk was just so much fun. I forgot that getting totally retarded is actually really fun. Oh man. I can't be my friend Baron's sponsor now. Needless to say, i probably wasn't looking very hot when I went to shoot "Hot Babes, Ugly Dudes" for VH1 this afternoon. "Ugly Writers, No Boyfriend."   I really love this band called  urlLink the Killers . I can't stop listening to them and especially the song "Jenny" (which is on the page i've linked). I don't know how to describe their sound... they're sort of dark, rocking, dancey and the singer's voice is super unique -- one moment it sounds like the guy from the mars volta and the next it's a bit like  urlLink Robert Smith . I once rode my bike home listening to "Jenny" about 10 times.  This sort of make me thinks about how hard monthly magazines have it. We write our content three or more months before it actually hits the stands or lands in someone's mailbox. We need to predict what will be popular and who our readers will want to read about, and with the internet being the absolute best tool to find about new bands, i worry that people will think that we're so behind the times. Magazines really didnt have to compete with the web 5 years ago.   More importantly, why are people constantly shocked by the fact that i think  urlLink Tom Cruise  is fucking hot? I mean, I also like  urlLink Ewan  and  urlLink Jude ... but Tom isn't bad, I don't think.  RedBull sent me 5 cases of their product today. Five fucking cases! Maybe I should write Phizer and tell them how much i love Vike. This is a joke!

       urlLink Fly Life  thinks i have bodacious tatas. Thank you!  My friend Iann just shared this little tidbit about Morrissey that I thought I'd share: "i also love that the four times I saw him, the "pit" if you want to call it that, was three times as insane as any metal show. all these buff young jock men finally being ok with being a little gay and fighting each other to get on stage to give morrissey flowers"  OK, so Tuesday night was a fun night for me. I drank because I was allowed to. First i went to see  urlLink Kill Hannah  perform on the Carson Daly show, and in typical fashion i showed up an hour late and came just in time to see their part of the show. After the show me, Julia, Megan, Jess and a couple other went to get frosty drinks at Tequilaville since we've got class, and then wandered over to a Thai restaurant. Afterwards we all then went to an irish pub with KH near roseland and had a few beers (i only had one!) and Carson came to join us, which was nice cause he never did that with any of my other friends' bands who've played his show. Then we all went to SinSin to bid farewell/happy birthday to Tara Levitan, my bizarro twin. Then to Tribeca Grand to see Tommie Sunshine DJ. Then to Brooklyn to do Kareoke at Stingers. Then ... I've become such a fucking dork.  Last night was Marc's birthday party-thing, which he decided to hold at the St. Regis. Since i had nothing to do between work and those drinks, i decided to try the dinner at the St. Regis. Ugh. It was so not worth the price paid. Mind you, i'm willing to dish out a pretty penny for a good dinner, but what I got in return at the St. Regis was just satisfactory. I did get a kick out of looking like Oliver Twist in this fancy dining room eating raw tuna whilst reading the new issue of Details. They stuck me in the corner as if they were worried I'd scare off the other possible customers. Wonderful!  Anyway, the bar at the St. Regis is retarded amounts of expensive and despite only having a coke, I managed to blow more money than i'm comfortable parting with. Ugh. I didn't have any booze. I got Marc a shirt that says "I'm not an alcoholic, i'm a drunk. alcoholics go to meetings." He hated it.

      Wednesday night... A couple days later and what can i remember? Not all that much, but still quite a lot. It was another nail in the sobriety coffin. Not the last, but close. Had a little  urlLink Motherfucker  preparty at my house. We drank and smoked a bit and before long my bedroom was filled to the brim with cute boys. You know, a typical Wednesday night at apt 3a.  We all filed into a couple of cabs and headed to Mofo... it was a pretty slow night, which is understandable since everyone had already headed back to their homes somewhere other than NYC. I had a drink or 6 more and soon found myself dancing with the tranny and david la chappelle muse Amanda Leproire -- whom i'm totally fucking obsessed with -- on top of some platform. I think at some point I started making out with Greg, but in a total over the top way where I was pushing him around some area and knocking down things.   At around 6am I post partied til the sun came up. NYC was empty on Thursday. It was fa-reeeky.  It was one of those evenings that reminds me why Tim's nickname for me is Trouble.

       urlLink Andy  is the most clever human alive. No joke. I think he knows what the conversations are going to be before even entering them... like a reality show of sorts ... so he's able to think of these incredibly hysterical lines that have perfect timing.   You know what he called our cannibalistic universe that is eating other universes? Weapons of Mass Consumption.  He is genius.

      Right. I think one or two of these might've come out last year ... but at the very end. Anyway, here is my top ten in order:  1. Muse - Absolution - HOLY SHIT THIS IS THE MOST EPICE THING SINCE FOREVER!  2. British Sea Power - The Decline of British Sea Power - "Blackout" is the most gorgeous of songs ever. I remember seeing them in Brooklyn this summer and I gave birth to a litter of puppies when they played this song. It also caused the blackout of 2003.   3. Libertines - Up the Bracket - I liked it alright at first, and then i didnt like it and now i think it's so fucking genius and underrated, for real.  4. Blur - Think Tank - I didn't like it, then  urlLink Andy  told me to listen to it again. I did. And it's so surprisingly great. Like, there's no reason why they should've been able to write those songs that they wrote after all these years. I fall in love whenever i hear "Ambulance."  5. My Chemical Romance - I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love - I think this album technically came out a few times since last November. It's the best emocore whatevercore album ever. I know I'm biased, but seriously. They're amazing. I knew the moment i heard one song that they were going to be amazing. They have not let me down. I listen this album constantly.  6. Ryan Adam - Rock n Roll - I really didnt care about Ryan before this album. I would treat him just like anyone else -- which is pretty nicely typically -- but if i met him now I might drop to the floor and start bowing. This is how good the album is.  7. Radiohead - Hail to the Theif - I'm still debating wheater i'd like this album if Radiohead didnt write it and I still dont know. This is why they're so low on the list. If they rereleased the same album Muse or Coldplay did, people would be building cathedrals for them. HTTT was great, but like, their heads really need to be pulled out of their own asses.  7. The Darkness - Permission to Land - I don't care if they're practically a parody. This album is fun and awesome. I like Radiohead more than it for some reason.   8. Placebo - Sleeping With Ghosts - So great. Way better than their last album by far. I love Brian Molko.   9. stellastarr* - stellastarr* - God bless this band. such great songs. pixies meets the cure.  10. Pretty Girls Make Graves - New Romance -   11. Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Fever to Tell - This should be higher up, but i'm high up so i have no idea where to put it. Fuck. This album makes me want to rape little boys. It's just that good.  12. TATU - 200 km in the wrong direction - fuck off. this shit was awesome. hot lesbians!  13. Thursday - War All the Time - Fuck, i know this should go up way higher. I just cant even start thinking where. All i know is that Muse is number one!  14. The Music - The Music - i forget when this album actually came out. I love this band a lot. their live show is amazing and blows my mind. It's like a total Vike and Wine cocktail sometimes. You know when the lights are extra pretty and the music is extra loud but perfect and your legs feel like lead stuck to the dance floor... it's like that.  OK, that 14. but it's my list so fook you. I know that i probably missed some very essential ones. for this i apologize.   Off to motherfucker tonight.

      I love knowing med students because I've got such a disturbing fascination with the dissection of human bodies. I typically ask people what the dead people's lungs looked like becasue that sort of interests me. When I asked a friend what it was like to cut up dead people, here's the super fucking awesome response i got back:   "Dissect-ed, baby, "when I dissect-ed." I'm done poking around up-in some dead chick's guts. I retired, to the garbage, my smelly formaldehyde scrubs and sneakers covered in somebody's-somebody. Some of the girls seemed to have fun joking with conspicuous "huge cock man." Of course the major psycho-insecure-flirt girl got that body. But then again these are medical students (i.e. people who grew up in caves deep under the earth's crust). I'm not sure if all of them had seen a dick in person before. One 65 year old dead woman had tattoos so a student near me went, "oh my god she has a tattoo, be careful, I bet she has aids." So I kept using his body's hand to scratch his butt and freak him out. Until he got me into trouble. I think the hands were my favorite part because I could use them to hold tools I wasn't using. The naughty bits of my body weren't in good shape. The nice old lady we had looked to be about 80 and everything in her lower abdomen was so pancaked together it was hard to tell what was what. Girls have very busy bodies. I was left wondering how women can get through life without peeing all over themselves. There's no room down there and no muscles to hold it in."  I think I could listen to this person talk about dead people's bodies for hours if all the stories are like this!

My entire right side of my face hurts, even my teeth are hurting.  I think a wisdom tooth is growing or something... I dont know, I dont remember my mouth/throat being in so extreme pain in ages. I can't believe I'm going to end up using that vicoden pill for a painkiller instead of for fun.

      I've had a shit load of people emailing and IMing me about that  urlLink Muse  song. Whoa. My site meter thing LITERALLY says that NOBODY reads this blog. Anyway,  urlLink Muse's website  posted their video for "Time Is Running Out" on their site. Click on "media" and then on "video" and chose "time is running out."   The video is the fucking shit. Matt Bellamy looks like Ian Curtis in it.

      Last night I had a dream that I was in my old house -- the one i grew up in -- and i'm with  urlLink Brian  just sitting around. I get up to get something from my closet and this gigantic doll that i used to have (it was a porceline headed clown doll that was 3ft tall -- i had two of them) was hanging by a noose in my closet and nodding it's head no when peeked inside. I freaked out, slammed the door, and ran out. Told Brian who said I was just tripping or stoned or something. I agreed and we just sat around some more. Then the other doll that was seated near us started to move. At first, i was the only one that saw it cause it just sort of budged... but then it started to roll around. That's when Brian grabbed me and we went running out the door. I can't remember what happened to those dolls in real life, but I think they might be in a box in my parent's attic. I never want a doll ever again. Except for my talking Master P doll who says "Uhhhhh! Na na na na!"  What I learned from this experience is that I dont like sleeping alone sometimes, however, when I woke up, I was totally diagnol on the bed. There's no way I can share a bed with anyone else -- unless is a gigantic bed. Which doesnt exist in NYC.  Lastnight I went to some party with Ben for some movie that's opening on one screen. It was free beer so when the invitation came my way I couldn't pass it up. As I was downing a few drinks we all got excited that Boy George was there. So I called up Vicki and told her to get to the party so she could stare at Boy with me. Suddenly Boy was missing and then another Boy George appeared -- this time the REAL Boy George. Can you believe that there was a Boy George decoy? I felt like I was in Star Wars, except with a less attractive cast.  What I learned from this experience is that having a decoy is the new having drugs.

       urlLink Muse 's "Apocalypse Please" is easily the grandest piece of music I've ever heard in my life. It's huge. It's a beast. It's one of the greatest songs I've heard in ages. You need to hear it. But like, you need to hear it on a really good pair of headphones and you dont even need to be stoned -- though that probably wouldn't hurt. There are no prominant guitars in this song, it's all piano driven and about the ... uh... well, Apocalypse, but not in an entirely cheesy way. Just sort of in a way that this song very well could make the apocalypse look really awesome and movie-like. In a movie, the world would be saved by someone miscast by Jerry Bruckheimer.  I listened to this song about 7 times last night trying to point out all the different parts to myself, miming the piano playing, air drumming, singing along like i'm some crazed politician giving the final speach. I feel like Mozart when i hear this.  Even Barry the Scottish  urlLink liked it , and he HATES Muse. Now all I have to do is convert the delightful Rob S.  Send me an IM and i'll AIM the song to you. My AIM is Ultragrrrl.

      Oh. God. Hangover. Hell.  Last night I went to Ben's house to meet up with him,  urlLink Lindsay , and Glenn (with two n's). Ben made me a totally awesome drink using Pepsi Blue (who knew you could still find that shit) and Rum... I drank a lot of these. A few other people came to meet up with us there including  urlLink Brian , Vin, and his biazrro twin. My head hurts as i type this. I dont know if i'm making sense i'm sorry.  We all went to Ryan and Alex's house for Eva and Alex Moreno's birthday party. I drank more. Partied some more. I bit someone's arm. Brian took a photo of me and I think i flashed the camera and if that ends up on his site, i will be killed by my brothers. The party was fucking great as Ryan and Alex's parties usually are. So many people. All so cute. All so nice. All so drunk. I saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in ages ... like Sebastian! And I'm totally unable to go out these days without seeing the danger twins Carlos and Paul. I believe I'm accidently stalking them. Eva's boobies looked awesome. I tried to kiss them. She wouldn't let me. I didn't make out with anyone i dont think. I'm pretty sure I didnt.   I drank a lot and then some.   After the party I relocated some festivities to my house.   I'm watching the Spice Girls' "Behind the Music." I want to be a pop star.  I'm leaving a lot out from last night. I can't think.

      Tonight was a busy, busy, busy night. Went to see  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  at Pianos. They were great. So great. Reminded me of a band whose name I forget and whose lyrics I managed to totally fuck up when I sang them to my friends. They're not "I would like to shoot your daughter" ... it's something else... ATC? ATO? Anyway, they had also a very Joy Division sound to them with their guitars and dressed like Russian migrant workers or like Interpol would if they had less money. The bassist played with the straightest face as if he were about to burst out into laughter and I wish that I didnt wear a strapless dress cause it kept on slipping down which made it hard to dance. None of these sentances make any sense.  After Pianos I rode my bike (it's fucking cold and i'm wearing a dress AND platform boots) to Lit to see  Five O'Clock Heroes  and meet up with the boyfriends. I didn't see Raph, but I hung out with Greg. Oh, the band sounded like the Jam, and were great. The drummer is named Mike and he looks like Gavin from Bush. I also met this girl named Marni who recognized me from  urlLink Brian's website . Marni was stunning. She looked like Angelina Jolie, but 5'3 and with a totally different voice. If I ever decided to finally bite the bullet and make out with a girl, she'd be the one. The resemblance is uncanny. You'd agree with me.  After 5OH i went back to Lit because both Daniel and Paul strongly, strongly suggested I check out a band that was playing cause they had opened up for Interpol at some point. Again, I've forgotten their names and think it might be a good time to quit some brain cell crushing habits. When I got to Pianos i found out that the band that i had never heard about until 45 minutes earlier wouldnt be on until close to 1am. I got tired of trying to avoid people and said "fuck this noise" and went to the Library to meet up with Rob, Marc, Lizzy, Maureen, Chuck, and Erin.   At the Library we talked about many very important topics like bloggers, Michael Jackson, and being a talking head. Talking about being a talking head was one of those really bizarre things that i pictured talking heads doing before I actually became one. I thought all the talking heads would get together and laugh about how they're on another tv show and kind of laugh at the normal people for not being on tv -- we sort of did that, but laughed at ourselves instead of others. Tomorrow I'm going to be taping "The Fabulous Life of Christina Aguilera" and my brother wanted to know when i became the xtina expert. Good fucking question.  About Michael Jackson: I dont understand how he was labeled as "black" on the mugshot thing. I mean, let's pretend Michael isnt Michael and he gets arrested and brought to jail and they're filling out the stats card... for a person who is not a super star international super star, they would've put "white" or "caucasion" for him. If you're sending out an APB on someone like Michael Jackson -- who isnt Michael Jackson -- and you're a cop on the radio, you're not gonna be like "Please be on the look out for a light skinned black male, 5'11 and 120 lbs" ... you're gonna be like "Please be on the look out for a gray skinned male, 5'11 and 120 lbs".  Basically, what i'm trying to say is: Just like they changed California state law to require minors to cooperate with prosecutors on child abuse cases AFTER Jacko managed to settle out of court, they should change the way we list skin color. They should actually apply to a person's skin color and not their race. Michael Jackson, theoretically, would go unnoticed if he was running from cops and a nobody because they'd be looking for a black man. Jacko is clearly not this.  I wrote a lot tonight. Whoa. I'm tired and had nothing to drink at all. A glass of water. That's all. I'm now exhausted and I hate partying. I really do. I need to hibernate.

      You know how Michael expects us all to accept his "I'm a kid at heart, that's why i love hanging out with kids" excuse for why he's always around brats? Well, when I was 10, the boys i liked were also 10. So if he's a kid at heart, then he's probably trying to bang little boys.   Just a thought.  Oh, and according to the New York Post, he was giving little boys wine and sleeping pills. Maybe Jacko and I should hang out.   In my heart, i'm a 19 year old girl.   I also am totally girl-crushing on Gwen Stefani from the "It's My Life" video. She's so pretty. I want to be her ... and then fuck her husband.

      Mom: Sarah, how's your drinking situation? Me: It's alright mom. Haven't been drinking much at all lately. You were right, it's so great not to drink. Mom: Great! And how are the boys? Me: Great mom. Mom: Why is your nose growing like Pinnochio? Me: We're Jews mom. Our noses grow.  This morning I found a pill of vike in my purse. What the fuck? I have no idea how that got in there, but I was so super stoked to find it. I think the pill fairy (fairie?) dropped it in there during my less sober of days. My previous life.   Yesterday I had to stay home sick. Lizzy spent all of last week home ill and Vicki came over for like 5 hours on saturday and sunday and got really ill and the both of them wondered how i managed to stay alright. Tuesday night it hit me and I forced myself to stay home and recover. At night I got dragged out by my brother, Leight, Seth and Guilia to see  Love, Actually . I am still in love with Hugh Grant.  Afterwards I hussied up and went to meet up with the stunning 30's movie starlet urlLink Lindsay  at the Coral Room for what was supposed to be the White Stripes after party. They never showed up. But Lindsay's friends were lovely and sweet and cute and one of them looked like  urlLink the singer of JJ72  -- a band that one person in NYC seems to care about. And that one person is me.   Oh. Little Stevie was there! And so was Carlos. This time we weren't dressed alike.

      I suck because last night on my way to Karen's house from Times Square -- where i was going to pre-party -- my phone died. So i had to haul ass to my house on the LES, charge my phone, and by the time I got up to Irving,  urlLink Kill Hannah  were already off stage. I've flown to Chicago before to see them play and the fact that I was unable to get to 14th street just makes me so mad. Granted, I've seen them like, 6 times in the past 4 months, but their live show is just that good. Have you ever seen 5 cuter boys in your life on stage? I would guess the answer is no.   Anyway, the Darkness were so fucking good. It was retarded. Totally fucking retarded fun. I felt like a retard cuase I was so happy... and experienced joy in ways that only a retard could. Maybe I was just drunk, but I love tards.  Justin is so great and can sing so well and he's so not attractive. It's like proof that I actually enjoyed a show when i'm smiling the whole time and don't want to fuck the singer for at least the 50 minutes that he's on stage. The command that Justin had over the crowd was just heads above the Bowery show where you could sort of see that they were really nervous. There was no nervousness last night.   Hal, the jewish rock photographer trapped in Mick Jagger's body, provided for some fun times during the encore while he was perched on Adam Mandel's shoulders. Justin seemed to enjoy it at first, quite a bit, but then i think he got nervous when the spotlight was off him. I definitely enjoyed watching Hal. And I definitely enjoyed Justin's preying mantis pretending to be a bunny dance move.   Afterwards Guilia and I headed over to Sin-e for the Viscious party. All the usual scenesters were there. It makes my sudden appetite for hermitage so much easier if it means I can see all my friends in one fell swoop by walking two blocks for 30 minutes. I learned, on this excursion, that Dennis Realistics is playing an acoustic show on monday and will be playing many cover songs. "Faith" by George Micheal might be one of them. When I saw  urlLink Audrey  she asked me if I was drunk. I said no. She looked at me funny and then i said "Yeah, ok. I am drunk." I will go sober again. But like, when I'm pregnant or something. Who am i kidding?!

      I use a Mac, so i dont know  urlLink if this works , but it seems really cool if it does.  I still feel like upchucking, but I'm listening to the  urlLink Katy Rose  album and strangely it's making me feel better. Or maybe I'm feeling better from the Egg McMuffin and Coke... hangover cure. Typically the Katy Rose album might make me puke.  Last night I went to the Thursday/Thrice show at Roseland and discovered that Jack White was at the Track's magazine party that I blew off because I wanted to hang out with my friend Mat. When I say hang out, i mean, straighten Mat's hair. I wish I had before and after photos. Instead, I'm gonna make  urlLink this photo  my desktop image I think. Mat's in the middle. His band are opening up for the Darkness tonight. I've been blacklisted by the Darkness. I love you, but i've chosen  urlLink Kill Hannah .  Missed Thrice but Roseland was a massive sweat box, so i'm assuming there was moshing. Thursday were awesome and I was so fucking drunk by the time they came on. My friend  urlLink Mikey  and I were running around upstairs chasing each other and smacking people's asses. He's got a mohawk now, which i bit. I was hoping to bite off a bit like you might with an icicle, but that didnt work. The two of us were retarded amounts of drunk and acting like 15 year olds who've never been drunk before -- i'm shocked we didnt get kicked out.   Oh, there was confetti. that was awesome. I liked the confetti.  Then I went with  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Sarah  and  urlLink Carolyn  and Gina to the after party. I dont remember the after party very well because it was open bar and I was double fisting non-stop. I have no idea how i managed to get in bed at night but i woke up with the tv on in the morning. I really wanna see what my liver looks like at this point.   Oh my god. The following exchange just occured: Friend: I woke up with a smile on my face and this message on my cell "WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU STOP MAKING OUT WITH WHOMEVER YOURE MAKING OUT WITH AND GET THE FUCK OVERHERE." Me: That's a funny voicemail. Who left it? Friend: You did.

      Whoa. I just got a CD in the mail from a group called  urlLink The Lost Patrol . At first, judging from the boy on the cover, I thought it was  urlLink The Honorary Title , but then I realized that it was actually Dennis Lyxzen from  urlLink the (International) Noise Conspiracy  and the Refused.   I've listened to three songs so far and whoa man. Is that shit mellow. Mellow, nice, but like the exact opposite of the Refused. Do you remember when you first saw  urlLink the Refused video for "New Noise"  and thought that your life was saved? That was cool.

      Missy Elliott was fucking amazing last night on SNL. Bands are usually so boring on that show (there have been a few exceptions), and hip hop artists? Forget it! Even not on SNL live hip hop shows are boring (i like hip hop... i'm not one of those rock-only snobs). But Missy last night was awesome. I was staring in absolutely awe as she had dancers do the river dance and make it look cool. I was like, fuck, why didnt I think of that? She even said that the dance was called "The Dutch"... but we white people know... it's the river dance. I can't wait to see that shit blow up on the dance floors.  Watch the video for  urlLink "Pass The Dutch" .  PS - In October,  urlLink Laura  brought me a copy of "Pass the Dutch" when I was DJing the Libra bash for Elliott, Jo, and Sophie. It was TOO bass heavy for me to get people moving, so i'm waiting for a remix.   Oh, and I heard some other Britney songs today from her new album  In the Zone  while watching the MTV special of the same name, they were REALLY FUCKING GOOD. I can't wait to get the album! I saw a couple kids waiting at the Virgin Megastore in times square tonight on my way to dinner with my family -- they were waiting to meet Britney on tuesday.

      Last night I decided to say fuck you to the weekend and stayed in. Vicki came over and we watched that Amanda Bines (sp?) movie "What a Girl Wants". The movie's subtext was brilliant. Pygmallian. Karate Kid. It was all there. Anyway, I hate going out these days. I think I really over did it for two years where I went out every night until 4am. I think it was since 9/11... i was like "We could die tomorrow. I better party now!" I had a slut on each arm snorting coke off my rack until the wee hours as I poured crystal down my throat. OK, not really, but seriously close.   Instead i cut my bangs and did a bang up job on them.   I really, really, really like the new  urlLink Phantom Planet  song "Big Brat" ( urlLink video ). It sounds like it was influenced by Blur's "Crazy Beat"... which is fucking awesome.  I'm also totally in love with  urlLink Razorlight . Their video is on their site and the song "Rip it Up" is like the Libertines meets the song "Twist and Shout". I'm going to find the mp3 or buy the cd and dj it.

      The Coopers video wasn't very good. There was a narrative in it, which is something very British it seems or something, but the band wasnt even in it. They're so cute. What a waste.  Music these days is filled with a lot of "what should've made" ... at least in my opinion. It's like, the Muse and Coldplay albums are the albums Radiohead should've made (sacrelidge! you scream?). Oasis should've written some songs like the ones the Coopers wrote. The Strokes should've had as much of an interesting, head slapping, greek tragedy filled year as the Libertines had. U2 should've written the song "So Alive" by Ryan Adams. The Distillers song "The Hunger" should've been written by Courtney. Axl might have to off himself after he hears the Darkness album.  Funeral For a Friend wish they were from NJ and called My Chemical Romance.  Men shine when they sing with PJ Harvey. She looks amazing in this Josh Homme video. I wanna touch her hair.  Hope of the States - "Enemies/Friends" ... They're wearing military jackets. Very Libertines. Yes, I would rip off the Libs too. They have a violinist in the band and one of the members look like Roddy from Idlewild and they have a military style drum. That is awesome. A violinist too. I dont know if i actually like this band or if i'm just drawn to them. It's like British Sea Power meets Coldplay, but a bit more annoying cause the guy's voice isn't so good.   Ed O'Brien is hot. And I'd fuck Thom Yorke. But that's a given.  lostprophets now. MTV2 owes me Muse now. Unless they played it. fuck. OH MY GOD. NO MUSE?! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS WORLD COMING TO? Or did they play them? I need to program a show on MTV.  Ed O'Brien = Hot. Thom Yorke = Sexy, Short, Fashionalbe. Phil Selway = Jew.  AND HOLY SHIT THEY'RE PLAYING THE "STOP WHISPERING" VIDEO! And wow was that a shitty video. Even though, I couldn't get closer to the TV to watch it. The Greenwood's have great hair genes. Thankfully, Thom stopped opting for the puerto-rican brass hair dye jobs.

      I'm at my parent's house in Tenafly, NJ for shabbat and to look at my old dog Maxine (she's a 15 year old blind shih-tzu who is too cute) and MTV2's  Subterranean  is a special UK edition. Holy shit. Life doesn't get better. They had a band on called Razorlight that were like the Libertines, only not as good but still fucking great. They make me want to pick up a guitar and learn three chords so I can start a band and be drunk all day and all night and just sing about being young. Wait, i'm in a band already with Greg called Debutaunt. We're huge in London. Someone over there claims to have seen us play before.   I hope they play Muse. Maybe they did and I missed it?! fuck. I am dying to find out what that band's plans are for the States cause that album is great. I love it. I swear I'm gonna get fired from SPIN because I keep on trying to make people listen to it and sending out mass emails saying how much  Absolution  rules. Nobody there wants to listen to me. I'm gonna burn a bunch of copies and send it out to all the other people at work and label it "Radiohead B-sides album" or something.   Oceansize are on now. They're ok. I think i saw them play at the Boarderline in London with Elefant, but I'm not sure. I might've been too preoccupied by the couple having sex in the bathroom and wondering what flavor condom they were using since the condom machine in the bathroom had various flavors like "lager", "whiskey", and "margarita" ... it's like, that's the shit that gets you in that position in the first place. They should make Alka Seltzer flavored condoms or something. Sober the fuckers up.  Ohh... Interpol commercial. That band makes my heart beat in my pants. Why are they so good? Speaking of... Not sure if that photo of me and Carlos on Halloween worked, so go here: http://www.fotolog.net/ultragrrrl/  I'm too sober tonight. I'm rambling. Must find something.

      My body hurts. I wanna puke. I wanna crawl into a ball and rock like a crack baby. This is how i feel today. Plus, I smell like fabreeze covering up saturated smoke and booze. The smell is making me queasy.  I saw  urlLink the twenty twos  last night. I really like them cause they remind me of Elastica a little, but for pretty much no reason other than the fact that it's three women and a guy on drums and they've got keyboards. OK, so maybe they're a bit like Elastica meets the Distillers or something. The way this band will end is this: They've got two stars in the band. Jenny the singer and Terrah the keyboardist. Two many stars are dangerous... even though Interpol pull it off alright.  Whenever Terrah sings I look at her dimples and wanna poke them.   I dont like Longwave.

      Lastnight felt like the first time i've been out in ages. I mean, i go out almost every night, but it was the first time in a long while that i've been out just to be out until 3:30am doing nothing but drinking and dancing to a weird mix of music.  The most dangerous thing about sweet drinks is that they're so good and refreshing sometimes that you just gulp them up as fast as possible. Next thing you know you're yapping about how you wish you were a guy so that you could get blow jobs from sweet little girls much like yourself. "Yeah, yeah, that's nice honey." *ziiiiiiip* "Now why dont you talk to my pants for a little while?"k  Ahhh... the joys of being a dude. They're endless. My rack hardly makes up for it.

       urlLink Lindsay  just reminded me that you can still smoke at Lit. When Greg and I were in London (by the way, he is the best travel companion ever, you should ask him to travel with you even if you dont know him), we kept on forgetting that we could smoke in clubs and even  restaurants . We've gotten so used to not being able to smoke anywhere that we were like "whoa, look! people smoking! while eating! while drinking!" We also agreed that we didn't like the smoke so much even thought we're both smokers. The german word for oxygen is something that sounds like "sourstuff" but spelled differently. Also, emergency landing is "not landing" ... they dont really mess around those germans, do they?  Oh, speaking of Germans, when i went to Madame Toussaud's wax museum I took a photo with Adolf Hitler, but i took my star of david necklace from my neck and put it around his for the photo. The germans were laughing hysterically. some of my friends thought i was totally sick in the head. It was Greg's idea and i think he's a genius.

      My brother Lawrence set it up so that this blog is on Ultragrrrl.com now. hotness.  I fucking love the new Ryan Adams album. I'm not a big Ryan fan, but this album is very good. Very good indeed. When I was at a Virgin Megastore in London i heard it booming over the speakers and thought "what is this? this is fucking great?" and low and behold, it's the guy who's feet i tripped over at the NME awards last year. He was sitting down and I used his knee for balance. I should've kissed him or something.  Last night i went to Marc's book reading at CBs. He was so much better this time around versus the first time I saw him -- which was actually his first book reading ever. I drank a lot and a lot more. I drifted home while singing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" like little orphan Annie. I had no money and felt like an orphan. When i got to Rush Hour I tried to buy a goat cheese salad but they wouldn't take credit card. Dave Prince and Ariel were there and saw my dilemma and Dave bought me a salad. So sweet. I had dinner and then downed a few Tylenol PMs so I could forget about my lack of money. I think tonight I will sell some CDs that I got in the mail today. THEN I WILL BE RICH.  "So Alive" by Ryan Adams is so fucking good it makes me want to get up on my chair and start dancing or something. But my big toe hurts and so that will hurt. I think i should get some painkillers for that.

      I'm seriously thinking of chanigng the title of this blog as it's so totally untrue these days. I'm no where near sober. Infact, in London I was back to my old ways. I was enjoying lager after lager until my nights resembled something out of a quasi nightmare paired with a fantastic dream.  I laid in bed last night, totally sober, praying for alcohol to fall out of the sky and into my mouth. I laid in bed last night praying for some valium, vicoden, anything that would help me sleep. I stuck my fingers in my ears. I stared at the ceiling. My body really needed drugs and alocohol and something. I'm no longer sober.   I'm back home and not drinking tonight. I will have some tylenol pm and pray that tomorrow is ok.

      I'm in London right now and have been since monday. The weather has been surprisingly great and the food has been expectedly terrible. I think i've lost five pounds since arriving, and that probably includes five pounds in great british sterling. i'm so fucking broke it's crazy. I was expecting some freelance money to come in before my trip but that failed so my rent check ended up swallowing all my vacation funds. I've managed to get drinks off my credit card and from the kindness of strangers. Shopping didn't really get to happen cause all the places i wanted to buy things from were only taking money, and cabs swallow cash like a high school sophomore swallows ...   I got to meet up with an old friend last night, which was so overwhelmingly nerveracking. I ended up drinking 3 beers with him so that i would stop shaking in my pants and then went to meet up with my friend Oli who gave me another beer and fun. We headed over to the Barfly to see Johnny Lives and after realizing that i had drunk an unbelievable amount of beer and forgot to eat anything the entire day, i sat down and asked to be taken home.  The funniest thing about this trip is that Elefant have been in London as well and so we've all been hanging out together a lot. I went to one of their gigs at the Boarderline and Diego dedicated a song to me. After the show i went into the bathroom and was treated to another show of two people fucking in the bathroom stall next to mine. A bunch of us started to line up to go in an Diego saw that I was trying to re-enter and got really concearned saying that i wasnt old enough for such things. We all then went to the Columbia Hotel and had more beer after more beer and Diego told me i wasn't old enough for coke either. I agree.  Oh, Greg and I are in a band together called Debutaunt. Brandon, Elefant/Interpol's manager is now our manager. We're huge over here.

      It's been forever since I've updated this bastard and I wish i could remember what I've been up to. The week has been so long. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday i was DJing. Each of those night I indulged in drinking. Yes, drinking. I drank and enjoyed it and found myself dealing with social situations a little bit better. All my drinks were free, which was great because I was so fucking broke.  I gotta say that last night I did a pretty bang up job dressing up like Carlos. I totally fucking adore Carlos. He's such a wonderful and great person... I hope that he knows that my costume was in tribute and not to make fun or anything. He's in the ranks of Madonna, Boy George and Meg White (whom i dressed up as last year  and  yesterday for work), so i guess he's iconic! Anyway, we got a photo together at Motherfucker. The party was fun, but my fucking rack was hurting me like a bitch because I actually taped the twins down as much as I could so I could look like a boy. But that didnt work to well and i ended up with a shelf instead of a rack.  Anyway... So far tonight I've gone to see the Walkmen. They were great. Hamilton cut off his hair and seems to have bulked up -- like he's been lifting weights. He's always looked like he could kick someone's ass, but now he looks like he spent the past month doing it. In a little bit i'm gonna head over to the Mercury Lounge to see British Sea Power. Both the Walkmen and BSP are a couple of my favorite bands, but I'm just so fucking exhausted that I'm having a hard time totally enjoying myself.   I need to get a good night's sleep tonight. Tomorrow I'm leaving for London for a week with Greg. I'm really excited about the trip but i'm worried i'm gonna exhaust myself. Sometimes I think I should save my vacation days for a tropical setting rather than an urban one ... but the men in london are too fucking cute to pass up sometimes. I'm gonna see a few shows, dance at a few clubs, make out with a few boys. It's gonna be fun. Drinks will be had. Oh yes, drinks will be had.  To see me on Halloween dressed as Carlos D with Carlos D at Motherfucker, copy and paste this in your browser: http://sp.fotologs.net/users/u/l/t/r/a/g/ultragrrrl/my_photos/2003/11/01/1067745563.jpg or go to:  urlLink http://www.fotolog.net/ultragrrrl/

       I'm DJing on New Years Eve   In case you didnt hear me the first eight times, I'm DJing at Don Hills tomorrow for New Years Eve. It will be fun. The flyer is  urlLink here . This is me DJing:     Also, my new years resolution (aside from no longer doing blow off the bodies of under aged boys ... they will be 18 now!), is to listen to all the cds i get sent each day. At least two songs of each. And lucky for me, I decided to start this resolution today because the third CD i listened to was a band caleld  urlLink Pitty Sing .  HOLY SHIT. PITTY SING are awesome. . They sound like old U2 mixed with Suede or something. It was exactly what i wanted to hear.   This is how my friend Greg described them:  "Radio" woulda fit perfectly on the Breakfast Club soundtrack.  Reminds me of Simple Minds with maybe a bit of early U2.  They are good at what they do and I enjoyed it but only in an escapist sort of way.  As James Murphy would say, "borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80's."

       Nerve Personals   About a year ago i started working on a feature for SPIN called "Rock Star Personals" where I had rockers fill out a profile for nerve.com to see what sort of response they'd get in the dating pool. Naturally, I wondered the same thing and joined as well. I'm constantly fascinated by the type of people who send me messages, and have even gone as far as to meet up with one or two of them (hey, i'm single and go through phases of hating that and loving that). Typically I leave the bar thinking "ahh... this is why they're single" and imagine that they're thinking the same thing about me. (Oh, but there was this one time when a boy was the spitting image of Ewan McGregor. He was hot.)  I've come to realize that I am probably a lot more shallow when it comes to looks than I would've once liked to believe. I pretty much ignore most profiles where the person says they're a musician (if I wanted to date a musician, I really have no shortage of those outside my doorstep). I get a little embarrassed when people say they recognize me from TV. I like people who look like they suffer from drug addictions. Ideally I want to meet a jewish boy, but don't typically like the way jewish boys look (there are many exceptions, i know, but the typical jewish boy that would send me a response on nerve is the typical jewish boy i'd never date), so I tend to ignore those profiles as well. I am over dating older men, and almost over dating younger men.   Basically, what I've come down to, is that I'm undatable. I'm easilycharmed.

       Holiday Sneer   It's always funny to me when people wish me a merry Christmas. I mean, I can understand the whole holiday spirit and cheer and whatever, but the whole thing means nil to me. However, I did watch so many hours on the Discovery Channel about the life of Jesus, Mary, and everything else surrounding the New Testament that the Disocovery Channel could muster. I watched so many hours, in fact, that I had a dream last night that I was Mary, Noah (of the Arc), and Jesus rolled into one.   For Xmas eve I went over to my friend Ridge's house in Queens. We watched Peanuts cartoons, Edward Scissorhands, and ate Jumbalya or whatever it's called/spelled. Afterwards I headed back into the city a little earlier than planned and had a quick drink with Marc. I also tried to climb into his suitcase so he could take me to Australia with him for when he goes to interview the Vines. As I was heading back home, my brother Lawrence called me just as I was driving past him on the street in my cab. I jumped out and joined him for a drink at some cheesy club that was hosting a Matzoh Ball. It was so incredibly lame (I yelled out "Sausage Fest!" as i walked in and got shot with dirty looks all around) that we left after 20 minutes. He headed off to the new Crobar and I went home. Apparently the Lubuvatch Organization were in their Mitzvah Mobile outside of Crobar trying to recruit new followers of the ultra-orthodox jewish cult-like group. When I was little my mom used to take me to visit Rabbi Schneerson (sp?) who is the person the Lubuvatch's look up to as a sort of profit. We'd wait in a long line in Brooklyn for hours and hours and walk up to him, hand him a dollar, he'd give us a blessed dollar in return, mumble something or another, and then we'd go off on our way. I was about 8 years old when we did this, so my memory is a bit cloudy... however, I'm sure he brought happiness to a lot of people. I'm just confused by what the Lubuvatch community is trying to do with their Mitzvah Mobiles... i should do some research.   Speaking of Lawrence, he changed his friendster photo to images from high school. He was so fucking cute and new wave.  urlLink Look! .  Yesterday, for Xmas Day, Nate the fabulous Roommate, cooked an amazing meal for his bandmates. It looked amazing... I couldn't eat it cause it wasn't kosher, but basically it was chicken rolled with ricotta and feta cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Nate cooks! He's like the best boy in the whole world. He also got a Christmas tree for the apartment which he decorated with white lights and blue balls (to pay respect to Hannukah), and we made an angle for the top using an image of Thom Yorke i found in Blender magazine.  After dinner I went to the movies with Karen and Jordan to see "Big Fish" (I was crying like a pms-ing girl who has just watched a Sally Struthers "kids in africa need your money" commercial at the end... not to mention squealing everytime Ewan came on screen). We all noticed Drew and Fab in line for popcorn behind us and so this prompted Jordan to ask quite loudly while we were sitting down "I THOUGHT DREW AND FAB WERE OVER?" not noticing them sitting two rows directly in front of us. God Bless Jordan for delivering the quote of the night. So Drew and Fab are back on!    When I got home, after going to Lit, I watched the World Idol competition that i had taped while at the movies. I'm totally in love with  urlLink Kurt from Norway 's performance. He was so utterly amazing. He sounded a lot like the singer of Kent. I think i'm gonna buy his album.     urlLink Free Jack White  items are for sale just in time for belated holiday gifts. Incase anyone is interested, i'm a women's medium. Thanks to Rachel for that link.  Finally -- I'm DJing at Don Hills on New Years Eve. The party is apparently gonna be really great, so if anyone reading this needs something to do that night, you should go. Come and say hi to me if you do! I will probably be very drunk and possibly try to make out with you and then you'll also discover my inability to remember anything and total need to document everything with my digital camera as a result. I promise to also play "Ice Ice Baby."

       Jack White    urlLink Jack White's Mug Shot.   Everyone is pointing out that he looks like  urlLink Michael Jackson . I think he looks hot. And what a suit! He's so good looking! It's such a great photo... I mean, it looks like it could've been taken for the cover of SPIN or something! He's so fucking smart. I mean, he know that this photo will be flashed around the media more than any other photo of him, so he's dressed so fucking well. So sharp. So perfect. Man-Beater or not... I fucking love him.        Bon Joyage  Many of my closest friends have gone away. Lizzy is in New Mexico, Vicki is going away til next year, and Marc is going to Australia, where he says, "i may never come back alive.  especially if the rapping kangaroo steals my money and hops off into the outback."

       Drunk Girls   Yesterday the fine people at Red Stripe sent me a case of their finest imported Jamaican beer. So I brought it home, called my friend  urlLink Andy , and invited him over to enjoy the lager before heading out to meet up with  urlLink Brian  for some Kareoke at Lolita Tavern.  Andy came over with his med school friend Jared. We sat around drinking, smoking, and talking about the Olsen Twins. Jared's family is born-again Christian and I learned that he kept Kosher and celebrates Passover. Like me, he thinks that Hannukah isn't as important of a holiday as the media would like us to think. Whatever, the festival of lights was important, but in the grand scheme of things, the holiday gets more attention than it should because it falls in the same month of Christmas. I think that in my 23 years of living, I got about 3 gifts on Hannukah, and it was all coincedental because my mom just likes to shop. Last weekend she bought me a new comforter and Ralph Lauren sheets... but only because she loves to shop, not because she was posing as Hannukah Harry.  Anyway... on to the important stuff: After the three of us had a few drinks we headed over to Lolita Tavern to meet up with Brian and participate in some Sid and Buddy Kareoke. [By the way, i think S&B will be hosting the Aquarius Birthday Kareoke Bash that i'm having with  urlLink Laura  and Dan -- everyone is invited, of course]. Good times as usual. Jared joined me on stage to sing "Ziggy Stardust" ... I tried to serenade a drunk girl who was passed out, but even my off-key singing didnt wake her. So everyone posed with her.   Eventually I woke her up (which took a lot of shaking, prodding, etc), helped her up, and told her that she had to go. Andy brought her some water, she drank it and ran out. We tried to find her to put her in a taxi, but she literally disappeared into the night. Vanished.

       Dear The Flu   Dear The Flu, Thanks for coming just in time for the holiday party season. I know that you and God had to do it to prevent me from drinking too much and dying from alcohol posioning at the holiday party. That's cool. I can live with that. Instead I sat in bed thinking that all i needed were drops of zinc to cure me until I woke up on friday afternoon and texted Lizzy to come into my room to see if I had a fever since I couldn't move. Determining that I was burning up, she brought me some NyQuil and Orange Juice. Then Damon came over to give me Theraflu. At about 2am, Marc jumped into my bed and found me heating up and sweaty. The next morning I woke up healthy! See ya next year!  Love, Sarah.

       More updates   I'm home sick and losing my mind.   You know when I said that "Hey Ya!" was the best song that's been released in ages? When I say "ages" i mean, like, since last week. It's an INCREDIBLE song... but the other best song that i've heard in ages is Ryan Adams' "So Alive" and thanks to a  urlLink Ypersound , I got to watch  urlLink the Ryan Adams Video!  My friend Raphael looks exactly like Ryan. It's so fucking scary.

       The OC vs. 90210   Tenafly, NJ is represented in both shows. Totally crazy! The OC's Tate Donovan and 90210's Mother of Brenda and Brandon Walsh = Tenafly kids. Now, all we need is for Mira Sorvino to find her place on a Fox Show and we can probably ask the people at Fox to donate some $$ to Tenafly High School.  I think i have a really big massive crush on Seth Cohen.

       Scenes from a Birthday Party   The following Quotes happened at Sarah Wilson's Birthday Extravaganza:  "Which one of you posted that thing about Orlando Bloom being a bad fuck?" "That was Whatevs! Not me!" "I can't wait to update my blog!" "Do you think it's worse to be Jude Law's unattractive brother or sister?" "Sarah, please stop. Too much information!" "Do you have a blog too?"  Quotes courtesey of:  urlLink Jenny , Dan,  Laura , David, and Me.  I'm very sick today.

       Where is my Mind?   I'm sort of obsessed, again, with  urlLink Giant Drag . They're an LA duo that sound like a poppier version of Mazzy Star. So fucking good. Music on the website. So fucking good. Trust me.  Anyway... on to a proper update:  My mom called me on thursday night to tell me not to come home for Shabbat dinner on friday since she and my dad would be going to DC to visit my brother Albert, which marked my second consecutive Friday of missing Shabbat... which bums me out. The previous Friday i got snowed in. As  urlLink Whatevs  would say, no buzz.   So friday night on my way home I bought a DVD player for $50 and $75 worth in DVDs, ordered some Zen Palate, and watched "Zoolander". No Drinking! It's amazing that the Olsen Twins movie, "When In Rome", really resembles the production value of a Cinemax porn. Exactly. Needless to say, I'm still obsessed with those two, and all siblings in general (Hiltons, Gallaghers, Greenwoods).   Saturday night I went to the Snow Ball rock-critic party at Siberia. Drank a few drinks. And just spent 4 hours dancing to hip hop. Earlier in the night i went with  urlLink Miss Modernage  (who climbed out of her exile) to  urlLink Jinner's  birthday party. OK, I crashed it, and proceeded to eat all her fine chinese delicacies and hog the Kareoke machine with MM. You can see photos ... [photos have been taken down to protect the identity of MM.] No Buzz!  On Sunday I took my 16 and 17 year old cousins to see  urlLink My Chemical Romance , who were opening up for Mindless Self Indulgence. MCR's new songs are amazing, but the crowd wasn't buying what they were selling. At one point, Gerard the singer (who was decked out in corpse makeup), told the crowd to spit on him at the count of three... and they did. My poor cousin Eric was right up by the stage -- front and center -- and got hit a bit. It was shocking to see how much spit was flying through the air.   The opening band was called Tub Ring, and while I was in MCR's dressing room (which they shared with TR), catching up, the singer of TR asked the room "What's cooler than being cool?"... which the room replied "ICE COLD!" and then everyone started singing "Hey Ya!" I asked one of the TR guys if they were gonna cover that song and he said, sort of in a mocking way, "Yeah, we always cover songs that are sung in the dressing room five minutes before show time." I was like "dick." But then they did! Geezus, if that isn't the best song of the past five years...  MSI was one of the craziest bands I've seen in a long time. Holy crap. It was like industrial mixed with hip hop mixed with punk. Their EP gives me a bit of a headache, but the show was fucking awesome. Their fans dress like they've raided a Hot Topic tho.   I was about to say that I had no booze on Sunday, but i remembered that i went to see Carlos DJ at Black & White afterwards and he gave me a drink ticket. I contemplated my drink selection for a long time before settling on what I thought would make me the least ill. I'm such a hooker: I ordered a Sea Breeze.   Last night I went to Webster Hall to see  Placebo  and sadly missed stellastarr*, but I heard that they actually were better than Placebo. I have to say, i was a bit underwhelmed by the show. It was my ninth or tenth time seeing Placebo, and I just found the new songs a bit boring live, and that's like 85% of what their live set is made up of. Plus, the sound was bad no matter where I was standing (too bassy on stage left, too empty towards the back). When I went to see Echo and the Bunnymen at Webster Hall it was like I was blanketed by the music and light show. Not so much with Placebo. They did cover "Where Is My Mind?" which was awesome. I must say that Placebo's first two albums are among my all time favorites.   The after party was pretty dead and drinks were really pricey (thankfully, two drinks were purchased for me... I had two drinks). My friend Scott kept on freaking out by how much I resemble Brian Molko. The resemblance is totally fucking uncanny, even I get a bit freaked out. Speaking of freaking out, i totally, and inexplicably freaked out on my brother after the show when he laid down the smallest of guilt trips (being the jew that he is, he didnt even notice that he was guilt tripping, and still denies it). But anyway, the freakout was totally uncalled for and I felt totally bad. I don't handle guilt well at all, it keeps me from sleeping at night.   Back to Placebo... I was hanging out with my friend Jess and we were super pleased to hear "Bionic" and danced around like retards (ok, only me). Stefan the bassist wins the coveted "Gayest Dancer of 2003" award for his interpretive dance to "Taste In Men." So gay. Brian momentarily turned into MC Molko in the beginning of the set and uttered things like "What's up New York Citeeee?!" I also met some people who said they read my blog. That was so fucking awesome!    Fuck, this blog update has been boring as fuck. Sorry if you got this far. Tonight is Sarah Wilson's birthday party. I will drink. And then hate myself in the morning. Just you watch!

Thanks to everyone I made out with (some of those photos are posted on my friendster page). I walked around with mistle toe hanging from my hat.

Justin licked my face, a lot. Sera and Eleni came from LA. Me and Vicki took the best photo ever. Saddam came. I showed up late. Danced on a table. An angel grew wings. Marcus came from Tenafly.

My metal/goth/extremo side project will be named: Call Me Morbid, Call Me Pale My emo side project will be named: Her Daily Obsession.  check out the flyer for the party on new years eve! i've never seen my name printed so big! ever!

       PARTY TIME!   Me and  urlLink Marc Spitz  are having a ghetto'd holiday party at Lotus Cafe. I dont think there will be any free drinks, but we'll be DJing.   The following was written by Marc, so please don't think i refer to myself in the third person.   WHAT: Sarah and Marc's Jew Wave X-Mas Party  WHY: Cause the Spin/Vibe Party is not open to the public. And it's really just a Vibe party that  SPIN staffers are allowed to crash.  WHERE: Lotus Cafe on Clinton & Stanton cause apparently you can smoke there w/o too much problem.  WHEN: 9PM Till Whenever. Monday, December 14.  WHY SHOULD I COME?  MARC AND SARAH ANNOY ME: Remember on "Do They Know It's  Christmas" when Simon Le Bon sang "There's a world outside your window.  And it's a world of dread and fear." And Sting came in and sang "Where the only water flowing is the bitter Sting of tears..."  Remember how cool you thought it was that Sting was singing the word "Sting?"  Well if you don't anymore, because this crazy business of rock has diminished your Christmas spirit, you will cause we're gonna fuckin' play it... loud.  As well as other holiday favorites and...  Pulp and Joy Division.  There may very well be drinks provided for Spin staff.  There will definitely be good cheer and Bing Crosby/David Bowie style harmony for all to enjoy.  Also, every time Ultra dances on a table, an angel gets its wings!!!!!!!

       Keep Running Up that Hill   Placebo's cover of "Running Up that Hill" by Kate Bush is really good, and I'm sort of really upset that I can't find it on iTunes, and I have no idea which song I should buy from her. I really like the original of this song -- and now it appears that I've maxed out my credit card and can't buy anymore songs.  urlLink Marc  is gonna lend me a copy of  The Kick . Speaking of Marc,  urlLink Suicide Girls  have posted an  urlLink interview with him  that was surprisingly interesting to me, even though I know a lot about him already.  My memory is truely a fucking piece of garbage. It's useless. I've willingly destroyed every last memory cell in my brain and I regret it. However, I can't say that I'm going to do anything to fix that. I sometimes feel like the guy from Motley Crue who overdosed (and technically died) from heroin, was revived and left the hospital only to do the biggest dose of heroin he'd ever done in his life. He learned nothing. And just like that guy from Motley Crue -- the one whose name i forget because of my brain crippling habits -- i've learned nothing. I think that sometimes i'd rather forget than remember. I remember dreams better than reality sometimes. For instance, when I was 12 i had a dream that aliens landed in my backyard and turned it all into lava (i had a gigantic back yard when i was little with a tennis court and a pool and i was always fearful that aliens were gonna land on my tennis court -- i'm not joking. and there was this endless expanse of woods behind my house that i figured was a perfect place to land a ufo). In this dream they did some pirated tv broadcast and decided to air a game show that showed my brother  urlLink Albert  surf boarding on the lava. I will never forget this dream.   What I did in the month of August, however, well, I have this blog to remind me.   I was looking through the archeives and thinking "whoa, i saw elefant dj this summer? whoa, I had a party?" Shit like that.   Anyway... Sunday and Monday were both sober nights for the most part. Last night i had half a beer.  urlLink Elizabeth's  best friend from growing up,  urlLink Ariel , came over for dinner. Lizzy made us Fajitas and it was the first time I hung out with Lizzy for more than 20 minutes since forever. At 11pm I was in bed and watching the "Daily Show" and learning about politics. It's sad when the only news I get is from Comedy Central and the  urlLink New York Post .  Every once in a while I'm temped to read something a bit more substatial, but I think I might have Adult ADD like those commercials I keep seeing will lead me to believe. Everything happens in spurts. I pick up the  phone and forget who I meant to call. I turn around and forget why I was even standing up. So unless my news can come in something short, simple, and to the point, i fear that i'm doomed.   Jude Law is stunning. I found a photo of him while downloading information into my brain. It was from the New York Post. I cut it out and taped it to my desk. Now, whenever I need inspiration I just look at him with his eyes and big non-british smile. I think: this man should be the father of my children. He's got like, 40 kids already, what's one more?  Seriously, if I pulled a gwynnie with Jude, I wouldn't drink, smoke, or eat poorly for NINE MONTHS. I would do this with my other non-Jude children as well, i think. I dont want to be stuck with no "Geek Love" babies.  Chuck called me his own personal Hilton sister. That was the best compliment of my life. Chuck is sick and I hope he gets well soon.   Speaking of the Hilton Sisters, i totally forgot to watch "Simple Life" last night. I think i was so distracted by Lizzy's cooking (and doing my best to make sure that the food was prepared relatively kosher).  urlLink Vicki  and I decided that Paris Hilton is the ultimate democrat. Most democrats (often characterized by their forward thinking) would be less democratic about the people they sleep with. But not Paris. Paris will sleep with anyone of any sex, race, and socio-economic background. She's an equal opportunist and not even in an insincere affirmative action kind of way. She's sincerely this way. Democrats could only wish that they were as forward thinking as she is.  Thank you Chris Clark for this amazing  urlLink link :   Dominic Simler, 30 years old, a managing director at 02Live (a corporation that sells Oxygen Terminals), and probably one hell of an alcoholic, has invented a device called AWOL (Alcohol Without Liquid). The device allows the user to mix alcohol and pure oxygen, getting the user drunk immediately and according to him, nixxing any hangover.   The Phantom Planet album just gets better and better every time I listen to it. Because of that...   An Open Letter to the Person Who Introduced Phantom Planet to Better Music   To Whomever It May Concern:  Thank you for lending the band Phantom Planet some good music. Maybe you accidently left your ipod at one of their houses and like, you're totally pissed cause they never returned it to you, and you probably had to buy a new ipod (which was so worth it anyway, cause you probably only had the 10 gig version while the 30 and 40 gig versions are so much better and cost the same as the 10 gig one did 2 years ago) -- but think about it -- because you did that, their new album is retarded amounts of good. This album makes me want to return TOTALLY to the days when I'd get really, really, really drunk and make out with boys who may or may not have been in bands and never return home until 4am on weeknights.  For that, I thank you.  Love, Sarah Lewitinn

       By the Way...   The new  urlLink Vines  album,  Winning Day  is actually really great. I am slightly addicted to a song called "TV Pro" -- which is totally psychedellic and trippy and rocking all at the same time and sort of makes me want to dance naked around a bonfire. The chorus is "Ahahaha a ha!" and "Dada da da da da da da da da da". My copy is computer protected and watermarked and says my name on it -- which means I can't share it. Sorry.

       Snow Day!   I love when it snows so much that it's ok for me to just stay home and watch tv. Vicki came over and we had a very VH1 evening. First was  Zoolander  followed by about 3 hours of VH1. "Before They Were Rockstars" followed by "Super Secret TV Formulas." The snow is so daunting. No thank you.

      OK, so the show i was on was called "Because I Said So" and it's on Star TV? or Chum? Whoa. I was so nervous i was gonna puke. It was a live to tape tv show much like "Tough Crowd" ... i felt like a deer in headlights. I did give props to Thom Yorke and I called Justin Timberlake a God.  Canadians are so nice.

      I guess Chris and Gwen decided to take practicing making babies to the next level.  urlLink Gwenny is preggers.   My friend Ron is taking me to a party on Thursday for that movie Big Fish and Ewan McGregor is supposed to be there. I'm gonna wear a tshirt that says "EWAN: PUT BABY HERE" with an arrow pointing at my belly.  Last night I went to Ben's house to watch "Simple Life" with  urlLink Lindsay  and Jay after I DJed for some VH1 thing. Ben was nice enough to Divo it for me (Divo is what i'm calling Digital tv's version of tivo). I love Paris. I dont know about all those haters out there, but there is some sublime genius to taking high heeled shoes to a farm. Also, Nicole Richie, God bless her. I've never seen a girl so intent on sex in my life. She's why women saught sexual liberation.  I'm in Toronto today. It's so fucking cold and it took me forever to find a sushi restaurant that would deliver to the hotel... but man, was it worth it! This sushi is awesome.  Last but not least, the absolutely stunning  urlLink Mary-Kate Olsen  (of Olsen Twins fame). Link via  urlLink Whatevs . I've been obsessed with the Olsen Twins for like, 5 years.

      Last night I saw the last installment of Lord of the Rings.   It was really fucking great. Holy shit fight scenes. I'd see it again in a heartbeat. I want a gigantic 4 tusked elephant to ride. If that cant happen, i'd willingly trade the elephants for Orlando Bloom.

      Holy shit?! How fucking great is that Vh1 "Big In 2003" Awards show? It's the best awards show i've ever seen i think. Totally fucking retarded in every which way. Fan-fucking-tastic.  I forget what my last posting was about, but Thanksgiving was fantastic incase I didnt mention it before. My uncle and aunt came over with their granddaughter who is so adorable, i want to eat her up. One and a half years old and already counting, singing the alphabet, and totally socialized. Such a great little girl. I want to plant one in my belly. Must stop drinking if i choose to do that. Oh the horror! However, I think that because i was so hungover from the night before, i had one sip of champagne before wanting to hurl.  Andre 3000 is the future. No joke.   Friday I met up with Ben C after shabbat dinner in Englewood. Nice to see a friend of mine from the city in my home turf. Ben is fun. Afterwards I went to Iggys on the upper east side to meet up with two of my oldest friends, Allison and Rema. I hadnt seen either of them in a couple of years and it was so nice seeing them and having a totally comfortable chemistry. I performed "Living on a Prayer" with Rema and had a drink or two, which eased my nerves on my horrible tone-deafness. I decided to liven our act a bit by jumping up on a pool table in front of me. Unfortunately i'm really really short and totally ate it butsting up my leg. It was totally fucking awesome. I rolled over on my back and managed to stand up and sing and dance on the pool table. Tables dont stand a chance with me, ever.  "Hello Mr. Table. I've had a couple of drinks and so now i'm going to stand on you because this seems like the right thing to do and i'm also very short and the only way people will be able to see me is if i gain a few feet. Thank you Mr Table. You're so kind. Let's fuck."  The next morning I got up super early to have brunch with Sydney, Allison and Syd's boyfriend Brett at that Essex place on Essex. Sydney and Allison were practically my sisters growing up. It was like being back in time or something. So fucking great. Cramed in a mimosa and a half, which sounds like a lot for breakfast, but it's better than my typical 4 mimosa minimum. Afterwards I went to see a movie with Ben and a couple of his friend. We saw  The Triplets of Belleville  and then i saw a heart shaped cloud in the sky. No joke.   Later that night I went to meet up with Dalia, who is one of my best friends and I've known her since i was 6 or 7. I hadnt seen her in a year because everytime she's in the city (she's attends school in boston) she goes to super pretentious clubs and bars with her other friends. While she invites me, I just don't feel really comfortable at those bars, can't afford them, and boys aren't trying to buy me drinks like they are her and her other friends -- hopefully because i'm a bit too downtown for them and not because i'm like totally ugly. I finally managed to get Dalia to come to one of my watering holes and she totally loved it. She thought Lit was very hippy-esque -- which is hilarious to me -- and made her feel like she was in a Doors movie. The thing about Dalia is that she can't walk down the street without attracting attention. She's gorgeous like Jessica Simpson style (only more petite), and black men LOVE HER. She could be the new star of the Black People Love Us website. All men love her and she's totally fucking out of her mind. It's amazing. Some guy pushed me when he was racing down the street and she tried starting a fight with him. So great.   At Lit, I only had ONE drink and Brian managed to snap a picture up my skirt. It looks like abstract art, not like the view to kill he was hoping for. I guess that's thanks to the red tights and GIGANTIC ASS. Also, Ben and co. came to meet up. His friend Natalka has awesome hair, and his friend Jay looks like Ryder Strong. I feel like Topanga.   Today was  urlLink Brian  day. We went to brunch, the movies, he then brought me home and showed me pictures of Grant's balls in a site update preview. Brian should model, no joke. Then Vicki came over and we ate and watched TV. No booze today!  Motherfucker Fun (courtesy of  urlLink Andy ):   Me and Raphael. Raph believes that if you look directly at the camera, it will steal your soul. This is why he's never looking at the camera, ever.    Me and Andy. It looks like I'm holding on for dear life. I probably was. Brian thinks that Andy is a dead ringer for Edward Norton.

       HOLY SHIH-TZU   I went home last night for shabbat dinner at my parent's house. It was nice and uneventful as usual. I mean, save for the extra dose of jewish guilt my mom laid on me for not wanting to spend the night -- i just can't sleep in that house without waking up in the worst mood ever. Also, when i walked in my mom started grilling me for apparently smelling like alcohol. She wouldnt leave me alone until i raised my leg higher than i have since quitting gymnastics as a tot and made her smell my jeans. I was like "listen, momizzle, i haven't watched these jeans in like, 3 weeks. they smell like booze because they're drenched in it." She winced and said "you should really wash your jeans." And then my dog bit my face.  My dog, Maxine, is a 15 year old blind shih-tzu. As I was leaving the house my mom picked her up so i could kiss her goodbye. I love her to death (my parents got her for me for my 9th birthday). Anyway, I kissed her and she didnt do anything, but she's so cute that I had to kisser her again and, POW, she freaked out and bit my nose. I grabbed it and gasped. This is the second time she's ever bit my face (the first time she ripped open my lip and i had to go to the hospital), and so I was a bit used to it. However, for some strange reason my eyes started gushing tears as blood started flowing to the floor. It didnt hurt tho. Lucky for me, I love scars. I just wish these scars were more like, on my cheek or something in a Tina Fey kind of way. Insead they're like, deep scars on the sides of my nose that make me look like even more of a drunk than i already am.  If anyone asks, I got beat up.

       ATTENTION MUSICIANS   I just got this in my email, so i know just as much about this as you do.     Here is a summary of the Guerrilla Video project:  GV pairs cutting edge indie film directors with hot bands, gives them a limited budget and time period and films the process of them making a video. We have an awesome list of indie directors and some great bands but we are still looking for musical artists to include in the project before we pitch it to broadcasters.  Any ideas are much appreciated.

       HO-FUCKING-RAY!   I'm finally drunk. Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this? I dont think so. I was at Don Hill's tonight for the Plus One party. Plus One is a management company that my friend Jonathan Kaplan started after finding a lot of success with stellastarr* and other projects he was working with. Sadly, I missed stellastarr*s secret show tonight, but i managed to catch all my friends who came out to support. I'm drunk right now by the way.  Ok.  Right.  So, i danced. The boyfirends came out. I was dancing with Greg when my brother sauntered over to us and said "make room for the holy ghost!" ... I guess he felt like we were dancing a bit too close. Thankfully he wasnt there when Greg the boyfriend undid my bra while he was hugging me as i bought a drink -- before i could say "Hello! i'm a pious one!"  Tonight was fun. I dance with Rob Sheff, Ali, and Raph a bunch. My head is spinning right now so it's hard to think right. Oh, i forgot to mention that i had this great conversation with Justine and Greg about band we love and stuff. Most interestingly was our conversation about bands we met that we wish we didnt. It's the sort of thing I constantly think of in my job. But really, whom am i kidding?  I also went to see "Win A Date With Tad Hamilton" today with the prettiest girl in nyc, victoria. I think Vicki managed to get the entire theatre riled up with her running commentary. Seriously, the only person to see a movie with this winter is Victoria. Someone asked me if this film was good and i was like "bring vicki and it will be the best movie  you've ever seen."   OK, head spinning too mcuh. Must sleep. Nighty night.  Mmmm... Franz Ferdiand are still good.

       BABY'S GOT THE BENS   Last night was Doug Brod's birthday party [ok, i'm totally interrupting this entry because i'm watching "Best Week Ever" on VH1 and it's making me so fucking happy -- think i love the 80s, but for last week -- which translates into the greatest crack britney spears' money can buy] which we celebrated at CB's with an open bar, rock bands, and the wheels of steel manned by  urlLink Marc Spitz . I started dancing when he dropped the Hives and managed to find myself surrounded by people when "Hey Ya!" came on. I also gave Lizzy a lapdance when he started playing "Closer" by NIN. I arrived a bit late and brought my own booze even though there was an open bar. Four beers in and I still wasn't drunk. I was buzzed, but not drunk. I lost my balance a few times, but really, that was only because i was wearing platform boots. You know what I found out that was really awesome? Doug is a really awesome dancer! Also, i found out that there's such a thing as psychedellic hip hop and Alex P promised to recommend some songs to me to check out. I had a really fun time and ended up staying really late with Caryn chatting with Ben Kweller and his bassist Josh -- who were both super nice.  I then went to Lit to find my friends Eve, Jenny, Dan, and Rob, but wasn't so successful since I kept from going downstairs -- which is probably where they were. I managed to find the boyfriends, Greg and Raphael (actually, the moment I walked into the bar Raph and I spotted each other and we didnt even say hello as much as sang/acted out the song "Tainted Love" to each other since it was playing, hugged, and then walked alway). I ended up running into another Ben, whom I alerted, looks exactly like Diego from Y Tu Mama Tam Bien (sp?) -- well at least the photo of him in the new issue of Details. Diego that is, not Ben. I started blabbering endlessly about being a Jew and wanting to marry a Jew one day and having babies, and then digressed into how i just can't get enough of the british boooooooys. "I wanna breed!" i yelled at one point. I wonder if i was feeling jewish guilt for not being at home for shabbat -- but it wasn't my fault -- my mom's still in Miami.   I drank another beer -- which equals 5 beers, and never got drunk. Infact, i got sober WHILE drinking. This is such bullshit. I didn't even eat that much yesterday. The only thing I can think of that might've been off was drinking a Red Bull. Still, I call bullshit. I'm not sure who or what i call bullshit on, but I call bullshit.  Is it wrong that i find Ben Affleck very clever and funny and not so bad? I also really like Ashton Kutcher quite a bit.  Radio 4's "Dance to the Underground" was just used in a Mitsubishi commercial. That's awesome for them!   THE JAPANESE ARE CRAZY   They are.  urlLink Here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  It sort of reminds me of that Nintendo movie starring Ben Savage and that Robin Williams movie TOYS where they had kids play war games to become better killing machines.

       DONT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR DADDY'S EYES AND SARAH IS AN ALCOHOLIC   Last night I did two things that are very out of character for me: 1. Attended a Starsailor show. 2. Arrived somewhere EARLY.  First off, i've often told my friends that I would throw myself out the window of my office if i ever had to hear starsailor's "alcoholic" song ever again. Second of all, i'm late to everything. I can't help it. I could be going to my neighbor's house and i'd show up a half hour late. But anyway, i blame the two above things on  urlLink Laura  and Jason Roth. For one thing, Jason made it so that the only way Laura could go see Starsailor (a band she loves) was if she was my plus one. Because I love Laura (and because she does the math for me whenever i need to save my money since i'm jew... but i do the driving) I agreed.  I met up with Laura before the show for dinner at Zen Palate with her friends Nick and Ben who are in a band called  urlLink Surefire . Nick and Ben are both in high school. Get your hands off my teenagers, motherfucker.  The Surefire boys wanted to get to the show early, and well, I had nothing better to do in the bitter cold, so I went with them. Plus, they said that a guy named  urlLink Johnathan Rice  was going to open and I remember Stephen telling me really good things about him.   So I went. And Johnathan came out on stage and before I set my eyes on him I turned to Laura and commented on how he sounded like Ryan Adams mixed with Chris Martin. So I got up on a chair to get a better look and nearly fell off with shock. Johnathan looked exactly like my very own mail-order teenaged scottish boyfriend Barry (who is now 20 and no longer unique... kidding). Turns out, Johnathan was also 20 and scottish. I wonder if the two of them know each other. He lives in Williamsburg now, so not likely. Already Laura and Jason were saying "see! aren't you happy you came to the show tonight?!" OK, i confess, i was.  Ever since I got Laura the ticket to the show (by the way, she totally let me take her home last night -- oooh the things we did!) I promised Laura that I'd hurl a beer bottle at Starsailor if they started playing "Alcoholic." Second song in, they did. My first reaction was to crash my head into the table and laugh maniacally. After I did that i looked for a beer bottle, found none, buried my head, and laughed. I think i went into psycho mode cause i started singing along really loudly and out of tune. Sarah Wilson's friend Terry turned to me and said "whoa! is this your favorite song?" HA!  So thankfully that song passed through my system early in the night. And thankfully for the band I didnt have a beer bottle to throw at them. After a while I found myself actually enjoying the show -- which i'd like to blame on the absolutely great hypnotic light show. You know when you're like a six year old japanese kid watching an anime cartoon and you fall into seizure cause the light and animation is so fast but you cant take your eyes off the screen? That totally happened to me. I found myself singing along to "Good Souls" and screaming with joy when James the singer said "there's a band here called Surefire that you should all check out on sunday at Sin-e." how fucking sweet?   Basically i arrived at the show ready to kill, and left a fan. Strange how that happens.     LEND ME SOME CHARLIE BROWN SUGAR, I AM YOUR NEIGHBOR!    urlLink So fucking cute.     I'M SO DRUNK THAT I DONT MIND IF YOU KILL ME   You know how the NME said that Franz Ferdinand would change our lives and we all laughed and threw the NME across the room and said "what a bunch of fucking retarded monkey people!" Well, you know what? Fucking shit, they might've been right. If the Strokes wrote this album we'd all be too busy jacking off with excitement and joy to stand up and go to work and our economy would go down so quickly that another world war would end up getting started THANKS TO FRANZ FERDINAND  AGAIN! .   Jordan the hot almost-teenaged breakfast clubber from Detroit said that Pulp's "Common People" will be the favorite song of the girl he falls in love with. I would like to trump Mr. Silver and say that the favorite band of the boy I fall in love with will be Franz Ferdinand. This month at least.

       HORAY FOR EARS! HORAY FOR EYES!   First off,  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  are the fucking shit. i just went to see them tonight and spent the entire dancing and jumping up and down with my brother Lawrence. I couldnt take it anymore, i seriously had to give myself a time out for a moment and have the following conversation with... myself:     "there's not enough room for you to dance where you're standing."  "yeah, you're right. so try to move a bit. that should sort you out."  "true, but wouldnt it be so much cooler if you GOT UP ON STAGE and danced? like, the crowd could reallly use a cheerleader. they're moving, but you know you want to get up on that stage and dance like you're at don hills and someone's playing 'common people' or something."  "sarah, this isnt tiswas."  "but it'd be so much fun. how cute are they??? and i just wanna dance! dance! i wanna dance!"  "simmer down sarah."  "ok. fine. bitch. i'm gonna yell out something instead!!"  "do it!"  "I LOVE YOU FRANZ FERDINAND THE BAND!"    As a result, my friends came up to me after the show saying that they knew i was there because they only know one person who would yell like that... and that's me. I couldnt help it! you see the sort of fight i had to have with myself first? It's all very planned out and negotiated. My friend Eve, who I haven't seen in a month or two since he was previously living in St. Louis, found me after i yelled that. Like, it's my mating call or something.   Anyway, back to the band. Franz are danceable like Blondie. The singer has a voice like a crooning Mark E Smith meets Mick Jagger -- however, i'd like to point out that they totally remind me of that APB song "Shoot You Down". So fucking excellent. Everyone walked out of there with the biggest smiles on their faces. I skipped out on the post show drinking in favor of sleep. But i'm so excited about the show that I had to post about it! AAAAAH!!!  pretty boys:      VIVA INFORMATION!   I also got to see the Information for the first time tonight. They showed so much potential and Max the singer is a total dream boat. His girlfriend, whomever she is, is lucky.     TV FREE BEDROOM!   I'd like to add that my TV is still broken. There is no picture and only sound. It's like having talk radio. I forgot that stepped into the time machine and went back to prehistoric times. Bullshit.

       OUT OF CONTROL, OR NOT SO MUCH   Friday night: OK, typically my Friday nights are reserved for going to my parent's house in Tenafly where I eat the Thanksgiving-like feast my mom prepares and then retire up to my room to watch comedy central and talk on AIM to my friends who have yet to go out for the night as i'm sitting in Jersey staring at my blind dog as she walks in circles looking for her water dish. However, lately my parents have been going down to Miami like it's about to break off the continent and dissolve into the golf. So this friday as my mom lived it up with her sister and kids in south beach, shabbating and probably arguing, me and my brother and father went to my mom's brother's house for dinner. It was fun. I quickly filled my father in on what i've been up to lately since we dont really talk that much. not because we dont get along -- we get along better these days than ever before -- but mostly because he seemed to be paying attention. He nodded his head and said "that's good."   After dinner Lawrence dropped me off at Hi-Fi so i could help Adam Mandel ring in his 29th year. His mom bought me a beer, which was awesome. Then  urlLink J.Go  dropped the biggest bomb of a question ever. I mean, apart from asking me to marry him -- which he does daily -- he asked me if we could raise little Moz, Bowie, and Jager as atheists. Are you fucking kidding me. I feel like writing a children's book in the same vain as "Heather has Two Mommies" but mine will be called "Why Your Daddy Hates God." Jesus, i sound like some sort of heeb freak. I'm not.   Anyway, Jason and Gordon introduced me to Diana who will be sharing a bungalo with us during Coachella and Adam told me that when he told his exroommate that he'd be sharing a bungalo with me, his reaction was "she puts the bung in bungalo." and "I'd like to put "it inn" Lewitinn."   Saturday: I refused to leave the house. I hate the cold and the cold hates me. Seriously, on my way back home from Adam's party, the milk in my breasts froze. Like two massive rock hard ice sculptures attached to my body, i'm still waiting and hoping they'll defrost by the time i make out with someone. Dare to dream.  So I spent the whole time on my couch watching TV. I woke up at 3pm, so i was the ultimate in slothness. I can't even tell you what I watched. Eventually I remembered that Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey would be on SNL so i called  urlLink Lindsay  and  urlLink Whatevs  and told them to swing by to watch it with me if they wanted. When they agreed I called  urlLink Laura  and  urlLink Brian  and Greg to see if they wanted to come over as well. At 11:30pm nobody was there and I was about drift into sleep when I got a call and suddenly my room was filled with 2ManyBloggers. Since it'll take me more time than i can handle to do the html for everyone that was there, i'll skip that: Lindsayism, Whatevs, The Minor Fall the Major Lift (whom i nearly kicked out for 5 different reasons -- including dissing radiohead -- but sent me a nice email today, so he can't be all that bad), Elizabeth Spiers, KarenPlusOne, NewYorkDoll, maybe some others? Dunno. For anyone that wasn't invited, please don't take offense. I told Laura to tell everyone at Dennis' show to come over, so blame her, my beautiful scapegoat. I honestly thought nobody would show up and didnt even bother buying more beer. Thankfully people came prepared. Oh, and I taught some super cute swedish guy how to knit -- which would've been cooler if he was from Norway, and made everyone watch the Olsen twin movie "When in Rome" and "Zoolander." You know, what, it was actually a really lovely, spur of the moment shindig. I also think that Whatevs is so fucking cool. Best evs!  Sunday: I woke up  at about 3 and had Brunch with Sarah Wilson at Clinton Street Bakery (surprise, surprise -- i need to move my bed into there for real). We were gonna see "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton" but it was sold out so we went to see the Mandy Moore movie called "Chasing Liberty" which was actually really great. I fucking love Mandy Moore. I love that she's not skinny and kind of plump with a belly and big boobs. Plus, her acting was really great in the movie. Really great. Not as good as Charlize Theron but maybe better than Christina Ricci. She's underrated.   After the movie i bough $50 in magazines and went home. Got dressed to see Laura and Rob Sheff DJ at Filter 14 and had one motivation in mind: get drunk. For real, i think i'm totally incapable of getting intoxicated. I can get stoned, that's easy. But getting actually drunk is another. I miss those days so fucking much. I miss the days when my friends would first look at me with a huge smile laughing as i toppled over and then i miss the look they'd have when i'd drop to the ground and take a nap spontaneously. These days i have too much control. Control is so overrated. Substance abuse is a lost art. I danced with the fine folks at Filter 14. Audrey, Jenny, Dan, Rob, Lizzy, Marc, Giulia, all of them. We danced to Laura. Booed the electroclash band and the not-so-good DJ who DJed in the front room during Grand Mal (which prompted Lizzy and Marc to offer me money to tell the DJ to change the music -- and when i refused  urlLink Jenny  did it for free). Danced some more to Rob. Then my friend Evan showed up. I've known Evan since kindergarden and so he came and we danced. Then i hopped into a cab with laura and evan and headed off to Bar 13 for Shout! Where I danced some more. Eventually I had to pee and went to wait outside a bathroom door for someone to come out. The first door that opened revealed J.Gordon. I pushed him back into the bathroom and proceeded to make out with him until the bouncer told us to get out.   Here is Marc protecting my identity since I looked worse than Britney Spears after a night of marriages:    Monday: I woke up on monday at 3pm again and met up with Brian at Pink Pony for some brunch. Ate two main courses. I'm such a pig sometimes, but i was hungry. I'm always hungry. Maybe if i ate less i'd get drunk faster?   I went home to watch some TV and nap some more and got Nate a cheesecake for his birthday after i finished watching American Idol in Lizzy's room since my tv is broken suddenly. After cake, Nate went to meet up with his band, Lizzy went to work on her NME piece and I sat in my room staring at the wall. My friend Kris then called me inviting me down to Max Fish for a drink with Franz Ferdinand and Chris Newmeyer (also from Domino records). By the time I got there, the rhythm section were the only ones left and hardly able to see straight. Karen stopped by and it looked like I was gonna leave shortly after arriving so I told Vicki not to come down, which i now regret doing because the rest of the night (which was only about 1.5 hours long in total) turned out to be totally random. I hung out with Paul and Bob of Franz and Kris and they seemed a bit excited to know that we had a friend in common in Barry (who was once a teenager and as of sunday, became 20, i'm still mourning his teenagerdom and thanking god that he delivered him to me when he was still 19).   About 20 minutes after i got there, Paul was like, cross eyed with drunkenness and couldnt really utter anything other than the fact that he was pissed that he couldnt get his fiance into the nme awards and was thinking about not going. i asked him about 40 times how long he's been engaged, and his eyes drifted down past my eyes, past my mouth, and onto the floor as they violently crossed themselves as if the words coming out of his mouth were making him ill.   Just before I left I ran into my friend PJ who i see randomly but it's always really nice to run into him since he was one of my first post-high school friends that i had made. Then Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley came over and asked me to help her find her jacket. My eyes were so dry from the heater that i could hardly think because i was concentrating on keeping my contacts in my eyes. I made no sense when talking to her but made sure to tell her how much Sarah Wilson loves her. After finding her coat, i was about to walk out the door and suddenly Zev Borrow passed me. We start chatting and then Kelly Osbourne walked by. We made eye contact. She came over and we started talking. I haven't seen her since November. She looked great. I miss her sometimes. I miss a lot of people sometimes. But we hugged, said goodbye. I then hugged Zev, wished him farewell and went to San Loco with the boys and Karen. Bob and i contemplated getting into a fist fight after eating tacos, but it was really cold outside and i didnt feel like going outside. adding insult to impending injury, i told bob that i could never punch him cause he's got the face of a little baby. instead we held up our palms and started punching each other to see who could punch the hardest. he punched alright, and i kept on punching the hand until he said "oh. i gotta play tomorrow. maybe i shouldnt do this?" so we stopped. the fight is so on  tonight. i have no idea what sparked it.

Until then, Brian updated  urlLink his site  with amazing photos. He also added a paypal link so people who read his site can donate money to making sure he has more mis-adventures despite unemployment.

       FUCK YOU BODY   You know why? Cause you didn't even have the common courtesy to at least get me drunk last night. Champagne, tequila shot, 2 stoli-o sea breezes and NOTHING?!   Michael T's birthday party was so much fun... mostly because of all the people who came to party. Including the very one and only  WHATEVS!  whom actually talks that way in real life.  More to come, but my bro is downstairs to pick me up for shabbat dinner at my uncle's.

I need to find out who is playing Britney Spears' character in the adaptation of the book she wrote with her mom "A Mother's Gift." So far i've heard that the movie might be called "Holly" and it's gonna be on ABC Family. Does anyone have any info on this at all?? I'm not crazy, it's for an article. I'm just stumped! Thank you.

       BLOGGER DILEMMA   My friend Karen recently realized that if her mom were to google her name she'd find her blog in which she speaks openly about smoking the marijuana. Luckily i dont have the same concern when it comes to my mom. For one thing, she has no idea what google is. Secondly, my mom was ready for a Spears-level intervention when I started this blog, so nothing would surprise her. Lastly, I don't talk about my excessive pot smoking, coke sniffing, or heroin usage on this blog. I save that for IMs with the friends.   Brian Battjer cheered me up by showing me photos of him and his friends being super duper homosexual GAAAAAAAAAY. I love laughing at homos.  I think American Idol is on tonight. I auditioned for last season (for a SPIN article that never saw the light of day). I spent two nights sleeping on a tarmac with a bunch of other hopefuls in Pasedena, CA. The entire time the kids sitting next to me kept on singing and singing and trying to get me to join in. I have a shitty voice, so i never did. BUT SOMEHOW, I managed to get a call back by singing the Smiths' "Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want." I didnt make it to the Simon rounds, but i did manage to tell off some of the pre-Simon judges when they asked me who wrote that song.

       ARMY OF ME   Stand back... i'm in the worst mood suddenly. I have no reason for it except for the fact that my body is totally in pain. My head is spinning. I'm seeing double. And I'm feeling extra vicious today. Maybe it's because i had 3 beers last night and twice as many cigarettes? Maybe my socks are too tight. I feel like i'm gonna black out as i'm typing this. I should go home. I just told Lizzy "I dont think X should crash at our apt. I fear for his well-being. He's messy, doesn't wash his hands, snores and I might stab him in his sleep." I still haven't caught up on my sleep from last time he stayed at my apt.  I'm not a psycho. Just at this very moment. I blame booze. Always a skapegoat.  Britney apparently had an intervention. She's in a sleep clinic, just like Kate Moss. It'd be awesome if they became friends with each other and talked about their nose collagen.  I'm looking to cut my hair like Anabel from Bow Wow Wow. Shaved on the sides.

       BLACKOUT... AGAIN   I went to see Rob the Street and Dan Byrne's band Morning Theft tonight. They were really fucking awesome. I was kinda surprised because you never expect your friend's band to be good, and they were. They reminded me a lot of British Sea Power mixed with some Nirvana. Dunno how that's possible, but i look forward to seeing them play again.

       BUSTED!   Thanks to a reader, i just found out that the 38 year old dude that Britney gave the in and out to is John Cusack! Let's hear it for her giving it to Lloyd Dobbler! I didn't think i could love her more than i did before, but i do.  Also, Laura  urlLink ModernAge  is DJing on Sunday. Here's the email she sent:     To: pleasecometomypartyyougaymotherfucker@themodernage.org   Ok another reminder... I DJ way early on Sunday (starting at 9:30) but what i didn't realize was 2 things: 1. the next day is a holiday, and you probably have off work, 2. Rob Sheffield is DJing the same night, but after me, and honestly, how much better could it get? BECAUSE ROB IS THE AWESOMEST GUY EVER! (I know a lot of ppl go around saying such and such person is "awesome", but for real, Rob really is.)  again, if you want to forgo the paying at the door thing, and prefer be comped for the night, PLEASE EMAIL ME (laura@themodernage.org) your info and the number of guests you are bringing.  Thanks.   bisous,   l

       I NEED HELP!   No, I haven't relapsed into a drunken-drugged out stupor... I need help finding a location for the birthday party I'm throwing with  urlLink Miss Laura "I'm An Honorary Asian Jew" ModernAge  and Dan Byrne. We were hoping to have it at this one place, but that's being closed for renovation. Now, i need to know if anyone knows of any bar that is typically empty and could really use the business that the three of us would be bringing them. There are so many bars in Lower Manhattan, one of them should love to have 100+ retards celebrating and singing karaoke on February 7. Please email me if you can help. Thank you.

       THIS GIRL IS TOXIC   Poor Britney. She's really got herself into some problems. I was watching Leno with my mom on Friday and he asked her what was oldest age of a guy she's ever dated, and she pretty much alluded to sleeping with someone 38 years old as her oldest and 21 years old as her youngest. My jaw was like, on the floor. I mean, she didnt say "the oldest guy i fucked was 38 and he was wheezing the whole way through", but she might as well. She also totally reminded me of me when i was sucking down the boozers. Her ability to hold conversation, and her body language just screamed "hello, my name is Britney Jean Spears, and I am an alcoholic." Anyway, i found this on  urlLink World of Britney :    Radio stations all over the country are reporting on their websites that Britney's new single 'Toxic' has been postponed until March 1st. This is all due to that bosses at her record label have now delayed the planned release and are considering banning any public appearances by Spears to promote it - fearing questions about the wedding will dominate. The world premiere of the Toxic music video has been rescheduled one day and will air on Tuesday.  These news came out after Britney failed to show up at work in Miami to to shoot a promo for an unknown feature. Nobody knew where Britney was and why she didn't show up. Well, it makes sense, Britney right now, probably has no idea how she will be handling this, as she has lots and lots of tough times ahead of her as she has not made her first public appearance (with statement) after the wedding. Some say she's spending some serious mother-daughter time back home, while some say she's currently in rehab (not the bad rehab, just the talking to psychologists type of rehab.). I'll keep you updated....

       POETIC LOVE TEXTS   My friend Brian M. has been sending me these awesome texts messages the past couple of days. They're so good that i feel guilty keeping them all to myself, so enjoy:    What is 6ft tall, has blue eyes, and is drunk enough to fall down a flight of stairs?    Even angels blow their loads when I dance.   Sadly i erased a text he once sent me that talked about rainbow koalas. He is a genius. He also made me a portrait of Neil Diamond using his own pubic hair for Neil's chest hair. I have yet to actually get this portrait since I insisted he frame it first, but i've seen photos and it's amazing.

       LENDING A HAND AND SEVERAL MILLION $$   Lately, I've been getting about 3 of these emails a day. I just thought I'd share:     Dear   PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT.   I am Mrs Iyesa Ismiana,named person from Kuwait. I am married to Late Malam Usman Ismiana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Sudan for nine years before he died in the year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted muslims.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten Million Five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with an oversea security company. Presently,this money is still with the Security Company.   Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this muslim organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to fund mosques, orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy Quran.   The holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christians converts and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner.   Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.   I don't want them to know about this development. With ALLAH all  things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to always pray for me.   My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslim organisation or a devoted muslim for this same purpose.   Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders.   May the almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect you.   Regards,   Iyesa Ismiana

       NYC IS AWESOME   Jason, future father of my children and  urlLink blogger , tells me why:      I just had the greatest subway experience ever! Two complete G's, full on super baggy jersey's, skull cap, and everything man, just totally thugged out guys on the subway both whipped out violins and started playing unbelievable classical music. when they stopped, everyone on the subway jumped to there feet and started applauding and people were screaming "bravo! bravo!"

       YAY FOR JULIAN!   Yay for Julian for being awesome to his girlie. Apparently the release of the next Strokes single, "Reptilia," has been delayed because the artwork listed the song previously known as "Post Modern Girls" (which is named something else now, but we'll just stick to what we know), was listed as "The Strokes Featuring Regina Spektor" instead of "Regina Spektor Featuring the Strokes".  I like that Julian wanted his lady friend to get the top billing. I think that's very thoughtful. I also fucking love the song a lot. I like her voice on it.

       SHE'S RELUCTANTLY GAINED CONTROL   Last night I met up with  urlLink Karen  at Virgin Megastore in Times Square to see the Darkness do an instore. They played 4 songs: "Growing On Me," "Get Your Hands off My Woman," "I Believe in a Thing Called Love," and "Love On the Rocks." I waved my arms in the air above my head and nearly lost my voice while trying to sing along. I also stood too close to the speakers and nearly lost my hearing.  Afterwards i went to Dos Caminos with my friends Rob S. (not the lovely Sheff) and Jen. I ate a salad and guac and we talked about food poisoning and today Jen told me that she got sick from the food last night. I also had a prickly pair margarita -- frozen cause it's classy that way.  Then i went to meet up with Lizzy, Niki, Ariel, and Ariel's cousin Sjidre at Cafe Mogador for some more food, because, I like to eat, a lot. A goat cheese salad later and we were on our feet and headed to lit to meet up with  urlLink Brian  (whom I'm trying to set up with Ariel), and see the Jasons DJ (Roth and Consoli). Ariel is friends with this guy named Josh who is apparently some famous classical violinist and he met up with us there too... i tried very hard to convince him that he should start wearing eyeliner, but I don't think he was buying it. Niki tried to convince him to cut his hair into a fauxhawk, but he wasn't buying that either. Seriously though, he needs eyeliner. He did shock me by being 35, i thought he was 25. He also shocked me by bringing the little brother from Little House on the Prairie with him to Lit. Also there were the Von Bondies (sans Jason). I stayed away from them out of fear that i'd say something utterly retarded like "How's Jason's face?" or "Care for some punch?"  Jason Roth said that the new Melissa Auf De Maur album is awesome. I wanna hear it. Wonder if she's better than Katy Rose.  Tonight Sydney and her boyfriend Brett are coming over for Shabbat dinner. When Syd and I were little we both were 20 lbs under weight (which gave us very Somalian-like features) because we pretty much hated to eat. Whenever Syd would come over for Shabbat dinner she'd clear her plate (my mom is a great cook) and i'd just poke at mine as my mom yelled at me for not eating and praised sydney for her consumption achievement. These days my mom yells at me for the opposite reason, which is only magnified by my father's recent obsession with weight loss (he will tell you how many calories your food is, how many grams of fat it is, and tell you how unhealthy the bread and rice you're shoveling into your face is).   I bought the  urlLink Phantom Planet  album last night, despite owning it already. I wanted to contribute money to the music industry and reward a band for their good album. I bought, no joke, five copies of the interpol album when it came out.    urlLink The Information  are playing at  urlLink Sin-e  with the  urlLink Madison Strays  on Tuesday, January 20.     Also, Franz Ferdinand are playing at North Six with  urlLink  PITTY SING  !!!!!!!! On the same fucking night. I don't know how I'm gonna manage all these shows, but redbull will guide the way.

       HOLY FUCKING AWESOME!    urlLink The Killers  have just announced that they're playing Bowery Ballroom on January 29. My head exploded all over the computer monitor out of excitment (which is sort of annoying). I dunno who they're playing with yet, but i'm pretty certain they're not headlining the Bowery yet. I CAN'T WAIT! Wanna know why?  urlLink Download this motherfucking song , and you'll understand!     photo and mp3 courtesy of  urlLink New York Doll

       HORAY FOR BARRY!   My mail order scottish teenage boyfriend and Nick Jago doppelganger, Barry Nicolson, wrote his very first cover story for the NME. He's only 19! Without a doubt, he one of the most talented writer I've come across. I'm so proud of him!

       THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH US   I still get dizzy and teary when I listen to "Karma Police". I remember the first time I saw the video for it... I sat not more than 7" from the TV screen... just so i wouldn't miss anything important. They were the first band my parents let me skip Shabbat dinner for. My first rationalization to them when pleading my case was "it's a religous experience, that's the important thing, isn't it?" Eventually, dropping to the floor, kicking and screaming (gucci little piggy) seemed to do the trick. They once played on a Jew holiday (i forget which) and i was pissed. Did you know that Phil Selway the drummer is a Jew? He vacations in Israel, i know this because he told me.

       APOLOGIES TO MARC SPITZ   After not only promoting his book reading on my blog and to everyone within ear shot, i was quickly reminded of my retardation. I had an important annual birthday to attend that night. And since birthday's come only once a year...  Anyway, Marc wasn't pleased. He recommended i share with you all his not-so-kind words. I'm choosing to share them cause they're funny:    i don't know why i'm doing this cause you missed my fucking reading, which was the best one i've done yet and two kids came down (up?) all the way from new fucking haven, cn just to see me for 20 minutes but you couldn't come from the fucking lower east side ... [text omitted for special reasons] ... as much as i hate you right now, i still love the kids and i think the kids need [text omitted].  there's nothing you can do to me that will make me hate the kids... the kids in cure t-shirts and thick black glasses.  so fuck you, my man.  you can travel uptown for lunch, right?  you don't have to go to your best sort of friend's monkey baptism/key party in  some loft/former brass cockring factory on delancey street right?  right.  rock trash!  motherfucker!  i love you.  and you can put this on your piece of shit blog, you hebe lush. m ps. i really was good last night.  and i dreamt the kids loved me.    I do love Marc Spitz tho. This should be noted. And I dont mean the olympic diver/swimmer dude.

       LONDON CALLING   Much to the British people's delight (or dismay, rather), me and a huge group of kids will be embarking on a trip to London just in time for the NME awards. It's gonna be me, the boyfriends Raphael and Greg, their roommate Andrew, my friend Karen, hopefully Vicki, definitely Rob S, the bf's friend Marissa, and some other folks who decided that paying $325 for a round trip ticket on Virgin Atlantic was reasonable for a long weekend (let me know if you think so also so you might be included on debauched times). Last time me and Greg went to London we spent the entire time running around from bar to bar, gig to gig, drinking our weight in booze. Many people were convinced that they had seen our group Debutaunt, and were fans. We're hoping for the same bullshit this time. We're working on showing the Brits up, and really, there's nobody better for this task than the kids mentioned above. God save the Queen and God save our livers.  In other news, I had incredible sushi last night at some place on the upper east side called Sushi by Gari. I'm still full.

       EVERYTHING ZEN   Introducing...   urlLink iPod mini !    OK, since this is my (non)sobriety blog: Last night  urlLink Brian  [site updated btw] picked me up from my apt and tried his best to fix my aching back which i seemed to pull while taking off my jacket(!!!). Go figure. We then went to my friend Kelci's going away party on Ave D. Kel is moving to Boston to go to Berklee School of Music, which is fucking awesome. She also happens to be the cutest girl ever. We met when I was 15 and she was 13, outside the girls bathroom of Dwight Englewood High School. We were both attending the Battle of the Bands and she complimented my hair (i think it was either blue, green or purple at the time) and she had her hair dyed some random color. It was like punk rock love at first sight. Amazingly, when I asked her who did her hair, her answer was "my dad." Anyway, back to the party: Kelci was drinking some pink drink that matched her pink pulled back hair and tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher. She immediately made me one, which i nursed for about 3 hours (it was very, very, very strong), and shoved viles filled with sweet liquor in all of our hands insisting that we take jello shots. Done and Done. By 1am, i was seeing double of everyone, including this girl that Kelci is best friends with who people were arguing about.  "She looks like Natalie Portman!"  "No! She looks like Angelina Jolie!" "Natalie!" "Angelina!"  God bless these punk rock doppelgangers.  After seeing double for a half hour, Brian and I went to meet up with Jordan who moved back to Detroit today to finish up his Journalism degree at UMich. Jordan introduced me to a clever word: "Sororitutes". Jordan is very clever and will be missed by me and all my friends. The three of us tried to do Karaoke at 2 in the morning, but when we pulled up to Nolita Tavern, it turned out that the place was about to go under renovation -- at that very moment -- and we found Sid & Buddy carting all their Karaoke equipment out of the joint. I guess the Aquarius will be at Brian's afterall!  RIGHT NOW I'M LISTENING BUSH'S  SIXTEEN STONE . I NEED HELP.  don't let the daaaaaaaays go by/i should've been easier on you...     Anyway, goodbye my sweet friends! Best of luck!

       THAT'S CRAZY Y'ALL!   OK, for the record, Mommy and Daddy's account of their time in Vegas was a joke. I discovered this after emailing them about it. Whoops!  Anyway, the former Mr. Spears has already provided us with Quote of the Year and it's only the first week in January!   "...that's when we needed to tell everybody what we done did." - Jason Allen Alexander Spears   For real, I couldnt make that shit up if i tried. Thankfully,  urlLink Stereogum  provides a full transcript of Mr. Festivus' interview with Billy Bush on some Magazine TV show right  urlLink here .   And here is the married couple:     Part of me thinks that the following thoughts ran through Brit's mind:  "Bennifer are here too, i'm gonna show them how easy it is to get married. Ya know, lead by example or something." "Justin, you think you're such hot shit with your Hollywood actress. Check me out, biznatch."  Looking at photos of Britney, i'm seeing the puffy face, the tired eyes, the thrown together look... I'm beginning to think that maybe it's time she start a sobriety blog also. Girlfriend, hurry up and get with it before they toss you in rehab! Give me a shout and i'll show you how to set up a blog. Lay off the booze for like, two weeks. Trust me on this one.

       MARC SPITZ BOOK READING   Sometimes people ask me why i promote Marc's book so much on this site. Well, the reason is because it's good. And I'm proud of him. And if you did something that i thought was fantastic, i'd promote it too. Also, Marc is the Max Martin to my Britney Spears.   WHO:  Marc Spitz reading from that book he wrote last year about the Smiths  WHY:  Cause the organizer of a new reading series at Barbes asked him to  WHEN:  Tuesday, January 6 at 7 PM  WHERE:  Barbes  376 9th Street (corner of 6th Ave) Park Slope/Brooklyn (go to  urlLink www.barbesbrooklyn.com  or  urlLink www.marcspitz.com  for more info)  MARC ANNOYS ME, WHY SHOULD I COME:  There are two other readers (three actually) Will Leitch (Life as a Loser), and Jeff Sharlet with Peter Manseau (Killing the Buddha), also you can say to yourself while I read a bit about Johnny Marr ("I hear Johnny Marr actually has this book in his possession now and commented that it looks 'Very interesting."  Cause he fucking did!!!!!) Also...it's a bar so if you hate me, get drunk and heckle me. Actually, I will pick up the first heckler's bar tab. You know, before kicking his ass.  ARE ALL YOUR DREAMS MADE WHEN YOU'RE CHAINED TO THE MIRROR AND THE RAZOR BLADE?:  Yes. Yes, they are.

       HOLY FUCKING SHIT!    urlLink Miss Modernage  gave us the fucking scoop of 2004!  urlLink  BRITNEY SPEARS GOT MARRIED.   Oh. My. God.  Meanwhile, Miss Modernage also put up the most comprehensive New Years Eve photo collage... i'm getting my ass grabbed in it.  urlLink check it.  Seriously, i'm scared to death of pussy, but like, i'm in love with the Modern Age. She was my New Years Eve kiss after all. Not everyone can put that on their resume... ok, like 40 people can, but so what?  Tonight I went to  urlLink Tis Was  because Brian Malloy posted on Friendster that he was coming back for one night only. I danced with Julie, Lizzy, Marc, and Mikey. We had fun. Too much fun. I'm drunk now. Well, not really drunk cause i'm still able to do some minor html,  but still. Some guy tried to pick me up, and here's how it happend.   Me : (to Johnny Kaps and Jessica) I'm the Jewish Madonna today. I'm wearing two stars of David and pearls!  Johnhy : Totally!  Random Boy : (a minute later, whom i notice hovering over our conversation) Are you looking for someone to dance with? Are you here with anyone?  Me : (pointing to Mikey, my ex) Yeah, i'm with him. (i'm not really, but he was the closest person to me with a penis)  Random Boy : Are you Jewish?  Me : Uh... Yeah. (while holding onto one of my two Stars of David)  Random Boy : Me too.  Me : Oh.  Random Boy : I'm from Israel.  Me : Oh. (turns around).  I'm usually much nicer and friendlier to people. But if your pick up line is "Are you Jewish?" while I'm wearing the BIGGEST AND GAUDIEST Stars of David that ever hit NYC (seriously, one of them was lined with crystals), i think you need a better pick up line.  Anyway, I dance a lot to everything good. People really should start returning to Tis Was. It used to be the fucking shit. What the shit?

       Whoopa!   Last night I got kicked out of Lit for throwing a glass bottle at a wall. Funny thing is, i didn't do it. Also, Jordan dressed up like Judd from the  Breakfast Club , so I think that put me in a rebelious mood.  I'm happy to be going out on the town again, but sad I missed both pre-parties that I intended on attending. I need to learn how to be more punctual in the New Year.

       Happy New Year!   Last night was the gayest and best new years i've ever had. Started the night at Greg's for Fatherfucker. When I arrived,  urlLink Laura  was perched on top of a couch and screaming out "SARAH!!!!!!!!" She pretty much played Paul Revere the whole night and instead of saying "The British are coming!" she declared "The hipsters are coming!" I asked her to be my new years kiss, and so she was. No tongue tho. I then made out with Electro Greg and an apparently bi-sexual guy named Jonathan with a Norwegian haircut. I also found a picture of Kate Moss, cut out her mouth, and went around with my lips in place of hers asking people if they wanted to kiss Kate.   Then i went to DJ at Don Hills and the place was packed. My first song was "Ice Ice Baby." I made out a bit more with other boys. Maybe some of them were gay. I'm not sure. I think i'm gonna make buttons that say "I made out with Ultragrrrl." Anyway, throughout the night about 1100 people showed up to Don Hills, so thank you so much if you were one of them!   I got home at about 8am. Walked my blind dog and then went to sleep.   Now I just have to wait a few more hours until "World Idol" is on. I   I know i left out a lot of stuff. My head is broken today.

       DO YOU REALIZE...   I'm home sick and watching the Mandy Moore movie "How To Deal." It's surprisingly great and has an amazing soundtrack (flaming lips, the music, and some others). I love Mandy Moore. I'm also in love with the guy who plays her love interest and I want to have about 10 million of his high cheekboned babies with fantastic hair and brooding eyes.   Did anyone go to CBGB's last night? Did the Strokes perform? Who performed? What happend?

       LAST NITE... I SAID...   OK, I have absolutely no idea if what i said about the secret Strokes show is true or not. But added rumors floating around L'Office de SPIN is that Moby will be opening. I have no more information about this event at all. I dont even like the Strokes.  Last night, while at Karaoke to celebrate Grant coming back to NYC, i found out that his return is PERMANANT. I think when he told me this my face turned red and my body temp went up. I was like "Oh, so you think you can go frolic in the wild west for a bunch of months and then come back and claim  urlLink Brian  back? You think so huh? Well, fuck you! He's mine now. You and Tara left and I adopted him. Fuck off." And then he said that we could share him. That works too since Grant is hot. I kissed him last night. Then the three of us -- Grant, Brian, and myself -- performed Madonna's "Borderline". Oh, that was after  urlLink Sid & Buddy  asked the room "how many people have made out with Ultragrrrl?" on a night that... well, a fair number of room occupants had.

      I hate talking about politics, so I think that I'm going to cease from doing so from now on. Instead I'll focus on what I know about, which is getting drunk (or not drunk!) and watching tv. I mean, partying. Yeah. Partying.  Tuesday I got to hear a certain album by my favorite fucking singer who was in one of my favorite fucking bands of all time. I pumped my fists into the air and demanded hearing songs "louder" and "again" and all the while i pumped more and more beers into my empty belly. A moment away from shaking my beer bottle and spraying it's contents all over my bosses, my stomach started bugging out so I just kinda hung back and listened to the crooner soothe my belly into peace until we were asked to leave the offices of the record label since I drank them out of house and home. OK, that's a lie, we were asked to leave cause it was getting late.  So i walked back to the SPIN offices singing, logged onto my computer, did a blog entry, and called Rob Holmes to see if he wanted to meet for a beer before the  urlLink Imarobot / urlLink Kill Hannah /Sounds show. Meeting up with Rob = good. Meeting up for a beer = bad. We grabbed a beer and i cringed with every sip, trying to hold down the dark sludge of a really thick lager. By the time we entered Irving Plaza I was telling Rob that it was gonna be an early night because my stomach had had enough with me and was calling a coup. So after Kill Hannah's amazing set (dude, they're so fucking cute -- if i were sixteen their photos would be lining my walls) which included the old song "Nerve Gas", i went to get my jacket. I was walking through the crowd when I spotted...  him . The boy my roommate and i have been swooning over every week. The boy we declared would be our next baby daddy. The boy who has made us want to move to the... OC. Ryan! He was standing with a couple of friends, wearing glasses, and looking sort of -- goofy. Not like, dorky, but like, happy go-lucky. Not intense like his character. So i walked over shamelessly and said "Are you Ryan from the OC? I'm such a huge fan!" and walked away. Me? I'm 100% dorkus.  So then Rob stuck me in a cab and I went home. I collapsed into bed by 11 only to be woken up at 3:30am by a drunken Mat Devine who was outside my apt and needed to be let up for a place to crash. About 15 minutes later the rest of Kill Hannah, plus a roadie called Wooter, were half naked and wrestling each other in my bedroom as I begged "Shhhh! You'll wake up my roommates!" Apparently they were at a club were some old coke dealer dude fell down the stairs and they had to wait for paramedics or something. Anyway, after the fagathon of wrestling ended (it was actually one of the hottest thing i've ever witnessed with my own eyes), the boys all passed out on various parts of my floor. The alcohol smelling sweat intoxicated me to sleep.  Last night I DJed a party for the  urlLink Club Dread  movie premier. It was as some fancy club called the Social Club and the KH boys came along with the Boyfriends. Last night was  urlLink Greg the Boyfriend 's birthday and my only gift to him was an open bar and a friendly smooch in the DJ booth. He spent the night looking for a "fit bird" and the only one he could find was also searching for a fit bird. Boyfriend Greg is way better looking then he ever gives himself credit for. I met him at a Clinic show about 2 years ago when I spotted him from across the room and literally dragged him by the arm with Lizzy (it was actually mine and Lizzy's first date without a chaperone) to a party I was DJing. I don't think he knew my name until a year later. And  urlLink Raphael , he's a better looking  urlLink Ryan Adams , only he's Cuban like Elian Gonzales. I've got the two cutest and most fun non-boyfriend boyfriends ever!    After dropping the boys at the  urlLink VonBondies  after party -- and after consuming about 4 beers in 2 hours at the open bar while djing -- i consulted my bed. My lovely bed. Alone at last. Unlit cigarette in one hand, and ashtray in the other, i drifted off to dreams of half naked boys wearing eyeliner wrestling around in my room. This morning I interviewed Simon LeBon. It's like boys in eyeliner are following me.  Tonight  urlLink Rob  is taking me out to dinner (hot!  a boy actually paying for me! instead of the other way around!). Then we're going to karaoke with  urlLink Brian  at Remote Lounge for a little Sid and Buddy action -- PLUS, Grant is back in town.   OK, the Stills just came up on my iTunes. I really love that "Montreal" song. I'm also warming up to Longwave. Everytime I hear them I'm like "who is this?" in a positive way. Maybe I just didnt give them enough of a chance. I think in my head i was always thinking that you could either like the Walkmen OR Longwave but not both (like blur vs oasis). I dunno. I'm not very smart sometimes.   By the way, apparently the Strokes are doing a secret show tomorrow (Friday, February 27) at CBGB's. Since it's shabbat, i wont be going. But I'm sure it'll be fun, sweaty, and loud -- if it's actually happening and not a ploy for some unknown band to get a bunch of kids to their show. I don't think i actually like the Strokes' second album all that much. Call me picky, but i really dig being able to hear vocals on a record. Maybe that's why i like the Muse album so much. Speaking of which...if you IMed me to get the track and i didn't reply, it's cause I left my AIM on over night at work.

       HOLY SHIT PEOPLE   I posted this in the comment box that went along with my "bush hates gay people" posting, but incase the person that should read it (and who so cowardly doesn't attach an email to their postings -- dude, i mean, if you're gonna dish hate at least have balls when doing so) doesnt read it, here it is:   OH MY GOD! my use of the word "fag" was IRONIC!  Holy shit. What kind of bullshit is this where you think i'm seriously using the word "fag." It was used in irony.   Also, if you dont like reading this blog, dont. it's so simple like that. If i dont like reading something, or listening to something, i just focus my attention on more compelling items.   And if you're gonna say that i should turn my attention to more compelling things when dealing with Bush -- this is the sort of thing that effects people in a different way THEN A STUPID FUCKING BLOG ABOUT HOW I LIKE TO GET DRUNK AND PARTY.

       UMMMM....   I just got really drunk on bizniz hours. It's ok tho, i work in rock and roll. That's what i tell myself. Anyway, i'm listening to "Apocalypse Please" by Muse at the moment. I'm on my fourth listen and each time i wanna fucking freak the fuck out. it's the best song, not counnting "hey ya!" that i've heard in ages. it's amazing. i wanna like, do something destructive and constructive all at once. i wanna scream. Please, for the love of God, please listen to this song. I will AIM it to you if you ask. I will fucking sing it for you. I want to listen to this song, and nothing but this song, for the next 15 hours. I know that i'm drunk right now, but i'm likethis when i'm sober as well. It's like I'm listening to Mozart for the first time and witnessing genius first hand. I can't listen to this loud enough.

Wonder if he'll do something about all the bullshit hetero marriages that take place every day -- i mean, if anything is disgraceful to the face of marriage, it's that.   IN OTHER NEWS   Remember kids, not all Republicans suck total cock! My very awesome older brother (whom is also a Libertarian) got the quote of the day on  urlLink PoliticsNJ :  Quote of the Day   "In politics, it's not a good sign when you have to tell people you didn't beat your wife, and a very bad sign when your opponent has $2 million to suggest you did." -- Fort Lee Republican Lawrence Lewitinn, on the prospects of Bergen County Freeholder Louis Tedesco winning re-election.

       ON THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF THINGS... WELL, SORTA.   Sorry for the 93rd update in the past hour. But  urlLink this article  totally made me stoked. Throw honorary Manc, Carlos De. into the mix and it's like, whoa. By the way, incase you didn't know, Carlos DJs at Black & White (in nyc, i think it's 11th street btw 3rd and 4th ave) on sunday nights after 11pm -- every sunday. He likes it when people show up.  In related news, i'm gonna be djing with the rhythm section of the Smiths sometime in March at the Tribeca Grand. Not sure of the date yet, but details forthcoming.

       WELL, FUCK.    urlLink Dont read this article  while listening to death cab for cutie's song "transatlanticism." so utterly depressing, i'm hardly able to hold back the tears. What the fuck is happening in our world right now and what the hell have we done? What do i (we) do now? I don't mean to sound like a stupid fucking hippy, but I'm seriously overwhelmed with fright by this article. I understand that it might not be true and blown severely out of proportion, but if even 1/10th of it is based in truth, i'm seriously considering the future in ways that i've never. Do i want to have children if they'll be brought up in such awful environmental conditions? what sort of life can i guarantee them? what is the fucking point anymore? even alcohol can't remedy this situation, not to mention it'll leave me severely dehydrated and there's no water to spare.

       ROCK THE VOTE, FOR REALZ     How gay is it of me to actually want to vote for John Kerry after seeing this photo? I mean, totally not based on anything else other than "Holy shit, he hung out with John Lennon! That dude is awesome!" It's like one day I'm gonna say "screw you" to rock and roll and become a politician and suddenly photos will surface of me with Interpol, blood shot eyes, beer in hand, and my broken heart as my boyfriend leaves me for Meg White or something. Thank you  urlLink Catchdubs!  for that.         Thursday night the Lot Six came to SPIN offices to perform a toned down set for all of us and some invited guests. They were fantastic and switched their sound from their typical post-punk sound to a more alt-country vibe. One of the members looked like Corey Feldman. That's never bad. I drank a lot.  Afterwards I went down to Pianos. It was like a blogger power dinner/drinks. If someone walked in on us they'd realize how utterly dorky we all are. The entire time we kept on saying "so best" and "no buzz". Then Rob Holmes bought me and  urlLink Scott  a shot of tequila -- which I really didn't want. I pleaded "please! dont give me a drink. i will puke. i cant drink no more!" But they laid down the peer pressure and so i tried to drink the shot, but my throat closed up and the shot just wouldn't go down my throat. So i ended up spitting the tequila all over Rob and Scott's feet. Whoops! Then Rob bought another round of shots to give me another shot at drinking, and I managed to keep it down... frowning the entire time. Then i made out with Rob.   Happily drunk, I sauntered down to the Bowery Ballroom with  urlLink Jenny Penny  and Lauren to see  Franz Ferdinand , AKA, the awesomest band that makes me grow a peepee just so it can get hard. I can't believe I went to see them at Pianos a couple months ago and now they're headlining a sold out show at the bowery ballroom and with each show i'm getting more and more stoked.  urlLink New York Doll  got so stoked that she couldn't help herself from shouting out "OH MY GOD YOU'RE SO HOT!" ... uhh... which caused Alex the singer to start giggling while singing "Jaqueline." Please, if you can, please go see them live, or at least buy their album when it comes out next month. I'm gonna buy myself like 4 copies for me and my friends. I only have 3 friends.   Ugh! Right now my parents wont fucking stop shouting about moisturizer. SHUT UP! It's like an episode of "Queer Eye" gone wrong.   Asian  urlLink Friendsters , unite and take over.  Cute  urlLink purses.   urlLink Marc  will find this particular tote very funny.    Melissa Auf de Maur's  urlLink music video .  Aston Kutcher is  urlLink 30 . But guess what, he's still hot and I'd still do him.    urlLink Muse 's  Absolution  is getting released on March 23 in the United States of America. FINALLY! Uhm, this is, like, the best fucking album of 2003, and maybe 2004. And not only are they playing Coachella, but I think they're gonna do a tour until the summer across America, and if you're smart, you'll buy your ticket the moment they go on sale. Holy shit they're amazing. Watch this  urlLink video  and tell me if it blows your load or what. If it doesn't work there, try their website which is linked above.   urlLink Barry  the Scottish non-Teenaged Mailorder Boyfriend (and future blogger! uh oh!) has a doppelganger. His name is  urlLink Johnathan Rice  and Johnathan is going to be playing a bunch of shows in NYC. He's like Chris Martin meets Ryan Adams and, just like Barry, he's Scottish and 20.   Listen to the Killers'  urlLink http://www.thedevelopmentline.co.uk/clients/thekillers/" target="_blank">"Somebody Told Me" ... and I guess join their street team if you're in the UK. Uh... I love them maybe too much.    urlLink  "I'll take the rapist for $200, Alex." . Thanks to Baron for that one!

       IF I TOLD YOU, I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU   Lots of stuff happened, but here's some of it since it's all a blur and the important stuff I can't share.   London was fun. Kim and David are the best. Greg and Raphael cause trouble in every room they walk into. Karen was a perfect partner in crime. We saw  urlLink the Killers  3 times in 2 days. I was in the same room as  urlLink Thom Yorke  but not  urlLink Muse  (ha! i even stalked their us a&r guy at the nme's to tell him that was so stoked that he signed them -- he was like "i heard about you..."). I fell asleep during the  urlLink NME  awards while drinking a beer. Petted Imran's babe-magnet afro. Danced on stage with Whitehouse and tried to get kicked out of the awards. Went to an after party at the Key West Hotel (after calling it Key Lime about 9 times) that was being hosted by Jet and Har Mar. Senior from  urlLink Junior Senior  was hanging out. He's really gay. Didn't see Kate Moss. Danced a lot. Shopped. Ate things with mayo. Holy shit i drank so much that I started sweating beer. Pete  urlLink Libertines  tried to take my beer right out of my hands when i was telling the  urlLink Queens of Noize  that i thought they were hot -- which they are. I danced with boys. I danced with girls. I danced on tables and chairs. I ate nine plates of conveyor belt sushi from  urlLink Yo! Sushi  (the british are notorious for not knowing how to cook... so i stuck to things that didnt need to be cooked basically). I saw Joe from the  urlLink Icarus Line . I saw a boy I like. I saw a couple of boys I used to like. I saw a couple of boys I'll always like. I danced with them. I walked to the tube station with Karen while very drunk singing the Killers and then upon realizing that i was about to get on to the Northern Line tube I started singing "Boarderline" by  urlLink Madonna , but changed the words to "Northern line, feels like i'm gonna lose my mind, if you keep on pushing my tube to the northern line" or something -- i'm not sure since i was drunk and persuaded another drunk couple to join me in singing after i stopped them from physically fighting. People in England dont like Arabs so there were times when cabs wouldn't stop for me and my friends or restaurants wouldn't seat us. The exchange rate is bullshit. The tap water sucks. Coke (the drink) tastes like poo. My friends there in London, they're the finest. They're the sweetest. The soundtrack of my trip would include "Take Me Out" by  urlLink Franz Ferdinand , "Rip it Up" by  urlLink Razorlight , and "Transatlanticism" by  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie .  Photos are coming. I swear.  Franz Ferdinand are playing tonight. Everyone's plus ones got taken away due to  everyone wising up and wanting to go . So if anyone has a ticket for my roommate and a friend, please let me know. Thanks.  Check out how smart Franz Ferdinand are (even if they dont mean to be).  urlLink A Must Read .

       HEY   I'm back. Update forthcoming. FYI - How shitty was "American Idol" last night? My evening was saved only by "America's Next Top Model". The overwhelming amount of British women and models i've been exposed to lately is forcing me to consider a change in diet, ie: stop eating.

       WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?   OK, so i'm gonna try my very best to recall what went on Saturday. The day started off taking  urlLink Brian  out to brunch at Clinton Street Bakery with Lizzy, Niki, Courtney, and Eva. The girls, naturally, loved Brian. Who became known as APBrian. All Purpose Brian. I would like to point out that both Niki and myself had two whole entrees for breakfast. I had a buttermilk bizkit sandwich AND huevos rancheros and Niki had two plates of something or another. I totally finished both my breakfasts. So full. Feed a cold, and baby, i had the flu.  We went back home, I took a nap, and then woke up in a panic when i realized that during lunch Brian expalined what a PA amp was, and that I didnt have it. So I started frantically call people looking for one. I asked Nate the Roommate if he had one since he's in a band and apparently band's would be the most likely to have a PA amp. No dice. After about 85 frantic phone calls, stellastarr* fucking totally saved my sorry fat ass. Michael Jurin hopped into a cab and schlepped the PA amp and two massive speakers to Brian's loft. Me, dressed in a black tutu dress, helped bring the stuff up. Then we looked at pictures of naked women on Brian's computer and drank some of the PBR that Danburn had dropped off earlier as we waited for the Karaoke to get set up and the people to start arriving.  Once the Karaoke was set up, and there was about 2 people there, I busted out with some Violent Femmes. Then Laura and I sang some No Doubt. At this point -- when there was about 10 people there -- i started losing my voice. A problem that kept me from singing anymore that night, but didn't prevent me from making a few special annoucements ("we've run out of beer. who would like to donate to the beer fund? please tip your karaoke masters!") in a very rhaspy, hardly audible, voice.   Eventually the place started packing up and i was like, holy fucking shit. A bunch of my friends from growing up showed up, which was AWESOME. Evan and Jon, i've known since kindergarden, came. Noah came, just by chance, cause he heard about some cool party ... i've known him since sixth grade! Dan Marcus and Cat came, and I knew them since sixth grade also, and Marcus officially gave me the best ever gift -- a pair of die he made when we were in crafts class together in high school and a free tibet pin from when we were in the free tibet club. Hilarious! Even my friend Dan Valentino came. AMAZINGLY, Greg the boyfriend came up to me, only moments after we had made out, to tell me that he had just made out with a really cute girl. Moments later I found him MAKING OUT WITH CAT! I was so totally psyched! It was so totally fucking awesome.  Someone gave me liquid vicoden, which i didnt take, but others did. The next day i got emails from friends who had taken just a bit of it and were still stoned. Crazy! I dont know what I did take, but all i know is that I couldnt remember any of the karaoke performances, but found photographs of me today standing right by the karaoke pit.   The Aquariuses had pins made up by this guy named Lou (who brought some kids to the party whom were in, i think, Further Seems Forever, and recognized me as "the girl wearing a Muse shirt in spin" ... which prompted us talking about muse b-sides for about a half hour. yes i'm a total fucking fagdork). Lou, is an awesomely prompt pin maker and i would like to plug him now. He's got great prices on pins and his email is passingtimemerch@aol.com.  The pins said the following, and were given out as party favors:   i made out with ultragrrrl i kissed miss modernage danburn is my manwhore   When I handed Greg the boyfriend my pin, he read it and looked up and said "this is true! on more than one occasion!" others protested that the pin was stating false information.  Rob Sheffield and his girlfriend, Ali the Rocket Scientist, performed an incredible redition of "Total Eclipse of the Heart" that literally floored people. People are like, dude, did you hear that redition? oh my god! so best!  My brother showed up, ready to party. Apparently he apologized to Brian the moment he walked into the house, just incase he did anything that was worth apologizing for. I also heard that he performed "Luck Be a Lady" and demanded that people donate to the beer fund stating "Frank wasn't sober when he sang this, and I shouldnt be either."  The cool thing about having the party be a karaoke one was that it meant CONSTANT HITS! Like, every song is sure to be awesome and sung out of key and everyone was singing along. it was so sweet and touching. Well, the photos were at least. I remember while walking around that the songs were all awesome. Sid and Buddy are awesome at being Karaoke hosts. Jesus. They're like, 2nd to none. They have a weekly gig starting up this week at 10pm at Remote Lounge in the East Village. It's so totally worth participating in.  OK, that's all that i can squeeze out of my head at the moment. I think i sort of want there to be parties like this one once a month. No guestlists! No price at the door! Enough room for everyone! and KARAOKE!

       SUCH POLLOCKS!   Thank you Neal! Now, neither me nor  urlLink whatevs , needs to update our blogs for the day!  urlLink HILARIOUS!  (btw, i dont like the Fiery Furnaces or Matzoh).    Feb. 8, 2004  |  If there was one good thing to come out of Nipplegate, it's that the big media -- and I mean you, Salon.com, thanks for the gig! -- finally started to pay attention to the real faboo writers out there in Netland. The moment that Tittiegate tore open, and I mean right away, there must have been 10 thou of us slapping our keys, figgerin' out the cultural score at halftime. It wasn't JanJax's boobie-oobie that was the big news, or Justin Pattycake's so very I'm-not-gay-rip-your-clothes-off-alterna-frat dancing. The coverage was way more important than the story. Our instant online commentary was so haps that if you blinked, you missed the word. Dancing Darlene and Joey Munch Munch were the best whores out of the gate. Much bling to them. The Day After, Nude Yorkie dot com scorched the Earth by interviewing Hellaslut, the rad DJ and blog bitch who started it all. By the way, I totally sang the Stills at after-hours karaoke last night.   We're making gossip on our own termz now. Saggymelongate was last week. When you're a Hipster Winchell, there's no time to go blinkers. You've got to be watching all the time. I pronounce this The O.C. Returns To The Air, Finally, Week. Mischa, darling, eat some ham! Adam Brody, call me!   Jannie Jackoo is a little fraidy red hen, and CBS is going to have a five-minute delay whether you like it or not, Jermaine Duprude. But that's OK, because my mind is always five minutes ahead. And who cares if the broadcast ends at 11:30 p.m.? That's when I usually wake up! Next weekend, I'm heading to Philly, the city of BroLo, to see the Fabulous Ms. Laverne, who looks just like Karen O. It's gonna kick! But first, the Grammys. Music is all about the jiggle, Dave Grohl, you phony Phoo Phighter. We can only pray for another Bazongagate. I'm lookin' at you, Meg White.  POSTED AT 7:32 P.M.   Note to Prince: Your songs are not going to work at the Bellagio, so quit trying. You're still too black for Vegas, baby. Is that Huey Lewis' horn section? Must be, if Justin Timberfake likes it. Quentin Tarantino thinks that Prince and Beyoncé together are the bomb! Remember, QT, that some bombs can be STANKY. I wanna see Beyoncé's right titty! It's very possible that cultural censorship could be the new fascism. Are you listening, VH1 producers? These are my obs, and they are hotttt!  POSTED AT 8:06 P.M.   The Beatles suck even worse when you substitute Dave Matthews for John Lennon. If you want danger, listen to the mofo Kinks! For pictures of me licking Miss Ellie and Pedro at New Wave Karaoke last night, click here.  POSTED AT 8:19 P.M.   Grammy cameraman! Please show more close-ups of Meg. I don't wanna see Jack. He's scary! The White Stripes will go down as one of the greatest bands in RAWK history. I knew it the first time I saw them at the Magic Stick. I've archived the photos from that show. Meg, baby. I will come to you in the dark of night when you call for me! I dare anyone to watch that performance -- come on, loserz, you know you're watching -- and tell me that rock 'n' roll is dead. MUSIC IS ALIVE IN AMERICA, PEOPLE! Like I said six months ago on PopCultureNotes, Jack White and Andre 3000 are the true musical geniuses of our time!  POSTED AT 8:40 P.M.   Great. "Cry Me a River," only the second-best tune ever with that title, just won an award for Most-Overrated Song. No apologies, wuss, no apolo ... Dammit! What occurred, Bustin Pimplesteak, was not "intentional," and was not "regrettable." No offense taken here. I had a stiffy that didn't go away until the fourth quarter. Now you get a Grammy, wigga, and we'll never get to see Janet's tatas again. Thanks a damn lot!   Posting will be sporadic for the next 20 minutes. I'll be taking the subway into Manhattan. Nellie Sluttburger's having people over for a Second Half Of The Grammys party. She's promised some Spin-The-Bottle and Stoli Orange. You know where NellNell lives. Meet me there, you lame-o spazz!  POSTED AT 8:54 P.M.   Madonna-Whore took a few minutes off from writing her next kid's book, "A Childhood Garden of Chastity," to show off her friendship with Sting, who introduced her to her hubby, Guy Ritchie. Hey, Stinger? Can you invite me over to yer loncheria so I can meet Nicole Richie? She really soaks my panties.   Sean Paul? I hear better rizzeggae on a Tuesday night in Williamsburg.   This wuz just the first nite in a HUGE year for Hilary Duffmaster. This tyme next year, she won't just be presenting a Grammy. She'll be winning one. But watch your back, darlin'! I got the lowdown on Lindsey Lohan. "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen" has the smoke and the fire. When is that freaky missy gonna be 18, anyway? Freckled and fine!  POSTED AT 9:19 P.M.   Oh, my god! Yoko Ono! That bee-yotch broke up the Beatles. Attention VH1 Producers. I have an idea. Last weekend, I was watching my Tivo of the Flock of Seagulls episode of Bands Reunited. The best! My palz Lemon Square and Love Muffin and I were tokin' and jokin', and I said, what about a show called "Breaking Up the Band," where the hosts spread nasty rumors and sleep with different musicians? It'd be like "Othello," but totally pop! Love Muffin offered to be the host. First up: the Strokes! Woof woof!  POSTED AT 9:37 P.M.   Black Eyed Peas, lookin' fine, ask, Where Is Tha Love? I got yer answer, right here, at the sweet-ass LES loft of the great Ms. Nellie Sluttburger. If there's one blogger whose hole we ALL want to plug, it's Nellie, esp. when she breaks out the Stoli mojitos. This woman, who coined the phrase "Brooklyn Pole-Sniff" while perfecting the position -- in reverse -- keeps the baddest damn Web site this side of St. Louis. As Lori The Backstage L.A. Prostitute says, "Nellie's not the sheezle, she's the beezle ebeneezle!" Word.   It might have been nice if June Carter Cash had won a Grammy when she was alive, and you can quote me on that, Mr. Washington Post.  POSTED AT 9:51 P.M.   Oh, for the Passion Of Christ! The Best New Artist is not Evanescence. It has got to be Stellastarr* or Maybe Franz Ferdinand. No. Strike that. I love love love the Fiery Furnaces more than I love matzoh. And that's a lot.  POSTED AT 10:04 P.M.   Samuel L. Jackson tells us: Funk makes us move! Funk makes us dance! Funk is inside the people! Yassuh! It sho is! I likes to dance to da funk! Earth, Wind, Fire, Outkast and Robert Randolph. Damn! George Clinton better book P-Funk some time in Tha Cosmic Rehearsal Studio! All we need now is La Jacka's honkers to make the night complete.   Ding-dong! FelonyMelanie just spun the bottle my way. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. There's a tongue in my ear!  POSTED AT 10:21 P.M.   The Foo Fighters and Chick Corea! Justin Timberlake and Arturo Sandoval! 50 Cent and Yitzhak Perlman!  POSTED AT 10:32 P.M.   Well, the Grammys sucked, as usual. The best music is in the hearts of the people, natch. Whoever didn't nominate Les Savy Fav, again, or Dizzee Rascal, for the first time, should have their pubes shaved.   Gotta work tomorrow. Sux. If anyone out there knows of a job, any job, in the media, preferably writing but also editing or even publicity, email me. But I'm gonna need the weekend of May 1-2 off. Know that in advance. See you at Coachella, suckahs. Hey ya!  POSTED AT 11:28 P.M.

       HOLY FUCKING AWESOMENESS EXPLODED   The Aquariuspotting birthday party was the fucking shit. Best party ever. Thanks everyone for helping make it so awesome. So much going on. Nobody got hurt. Nothing went bad. Everyone smiled and sang their little hearts out. I love people so fucking much. Details forthcoming, but until then,  urlLink Nick 's got photos on his site and a round up.  Oh, BIG THANKS goes to:  urlLink Brian Battjer  for allowing all of us crazy kids to have a party at his loft and for not freaking out when the place held more people then i would've imagined who were all drunk and having fun and also for not freaking out that Pablo Escobar's wet dream exploded in his bedroom. Also, because Brian is easily the nicest human you'll ever meet in your entire life... no matter how long you live and where you live. Also, thank you for being the object of desire for all my girlfriends who were swooooooooooning by the end of the night over you.  Victoria, Brian's roommate for being awesome and letting us have a party at her home.   urlLink stellastarr*  for SAVING THE MOTHERFUCKING DAY by letting us borrow their PA amp and speakers. Holyshit, that would've been one whack party otherwise. Not to mention, the band came throught on the 11th fucking hour when i called an hour before the party and said "OH MY GOD I NEED YOUR HELP!" That's fucking friendship.   urlLink Laura  and  urlLink Dan  for sharing a party with me despite my retardation.  Everyone, for coming.

       DARLING NIKI   I forgot to mention the most important parts of last night's activities. First off, it was Niki's birthday. She had a birthday dinner with Lizzy -- on Lizzy's floor eating Mama's no less -- and then she was kind enough to escort me to Pianos where we danced while Belvy spun some fine tooonz. Some friends from far away came to visit as well. I had only 2 or 3 drinks (I think!) and a shot of tequila and ended up not being able to move in the morning AT ALL. I came late to work because as I was heading out the door (fully clothed in my jacket, hat, scarf, etc) when the toilet started calling my name. It was like "Hey Sarah, remember those drinks you had last night and how you mixed your alcohol? Guess what, bitch, you're gonna puke... NOW." So i dropped my purse on the floor and did my business, looked in the mirror and said "You're not drinking tonight!"   I'm willing to take bets right now against that.   Niki's got a gathering of friends coming into town for the night and she's taking US to dinner! It's like a Bat Mitzvah or something! Surely the wine will be the only thing that goes with gnocci. Saturday will be evil as well I'm sure. My birthday party (well, mine and  urlLink Laura 's and  urlLink Dan 's) will be drunk. Lizzy bought me this amazing black tu-tu dress from H&M and I'm a goth ballerina now. So much total buzz. Oh, and last night I made out with Rob Holmes. He was wearing eyeliner. It seemed right.

       BUMP AND GRIND   I got bumped off "The O'Reilly Factor" today. However, they might have me appear on the show on monday to discuss Grammys. Apparently Russell Simmons said something news worthy, so he's going on. Bummer. The real sad story is that I was gonna wear this Donnie Darko inspired shirt i made last night.    I also DJed at Pianos last night. I dont think i'll be DJing there again on thursday nights. I think Keribomb and Belvy are awesome and sweet as could be -- however, their other promoter, Sarah, yelled at me for playing Madonna and Psychedellic Furs... saying the songs weren't rock enough (and that there was a strict NO MADONNA rule that i wasn't aware of). I was bumped off pretty abruptly and needless to say, I don't think Sarah and I get along.

       I'M COLD AND I'M ASHAMED   I've sort of become obsessed with the song "Torn" that Natalie Imbruglia sang (but didnt write). I also really like the Jessica Simpson song "With You" now, since it sounds like whomever wrote it was listening to "Torn" on repeat 1,000 times a day like i've been. I think i'm gonna learn how to play guitar so i can write a song "Torn" for Mandy Moore.  Why did  urlLink this  give me SNE?  Here are some  urlLink JJ72 Mp3s .  And this definitely didnt give me SNE:

       SPECTITULAR!   Two things first:  1. I'm gonna be on the O'Reilly Factor on Friday night talking about the Grammys. Totally fucking weird, i know! 2. I'm going to London, England next Thursday for about a week. If anyone knows of any secrets shows or fun parties that I should check out, please let me know. Here's my email address: slewitinn@spin.com  Last night was my birthday, so my family (my brother came up from DC!) took my out to Sushi Samba -- which is my favorite sushi restaurant. After about 4 sips from a mojito my mom was declaring her drunkeness. Naturally I had two drinks and was just slightly buzzed (tho i did order my parents a spicey tuna roll for no good reason). The place was so fucking noisey and at one point my mom yelled "Horay, she's finally leaving!" when the loudest girl at the table next to us got up to go to the bathroom.   Afterwards I went to Village Karaoke with Lawrence to meet up with stellastarr* for some jamming. The boyfriends -- Greg and Raphael -- joined me, and by law I can't do karaoke without  urlLink Brian . Even Julie Pie came down with two people from her office who are very cute: The tragically gay Shaw, and the Jewish Fabrizio named Ben. By the way, Shaw is tragically gay because he's as gorgeous as any man you'll ever see -- but you'll never have his babies! NOOOOO!  Anyway, I sang many songs. "Hey Ya!" and "Seven Nation Army" and a New Order song with Michael ss* and at some point (ok, many points), i sang while lying on the floor. I also sang "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand a capella style until my brother stole the mic from my hand... but it was Jonny Kaps' girlfriend Heidi who fucking stole the show with her asstacular karen-o-ified version of Zeppelin songs.   By the way, it took me 10 minutes to get up on a table and start dancing. I think I had too many drinks because by the time I came home I was blabbering something vaguely incoherent to my roommate Nate who just smiled and nodded a lot.   Monday night I went to dinner with Sarah Wilson and her girlfriends. We then hit up Rob Sheffield's birthday party where I was fed one shot at midnight. Rob is awesome, i'm glad my birthday is back to back with his.  Tonight, I'm off to see  urlLink Eva Cavela 's band called the Drive at Don Hills. Hopefully I'll be able to catch America's Top Model AND American Idol.  Oh! And Marti Zimlin sent me a pair of fucking awesome shoes! They're mid-calf, satin, chuck taylors with a dragon stitched on the side. I'm a fucking ninja... just like my blind dog.  Pop some  urlLink bubble wrap .  Two heads are better than one:

           Large Screen Projections + Drunk People = Lots of Fun. You know what? No matter how old i get, making the shadow of my hand poke people on projections just never gets old. It's like, awesome. When I DJed at Pianos today for the new  urlLink Vicious  day-time party that Audrey and Jasper are doing, I made sure to cup the butts of every footballer I could. I think they liked it.   I started drinking today at 2pm during brunch. There's this place down the block from me called Essex and they serve unlimited mimosas for brunch and I think I had about 5 by the time i was done eating -- which was at 4. At Pianos I had about 3 more drinks -- you'd think that by some point during the day i'd be drunk like funk, but nope. Sober. Painfully sober. I think my brother was drunk tho. He sure was acting like he had one too many drinky drinks in his belly. I danced to some Madonna and boogied to the sounds of DJing by Dave from the Stills and Greg K (formerly Electro Greg). I think i'm gonna play "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond more often.  After the party I went over to Arlene's Grocery to check out  urlLink Surefire . These kids are 17 and 18 years old and fucking talented as fuck. Plus, they're totally reviving the Prince Valient haircut. The boys performed about a dozen strong songs that were very power poppy -- kinda like Rooney. Oh my god, i'm so gonna write these boys a movie script like the Monkeys. They'd be awesome for that.  Oh, by the way, the half time show today was crazy fucking shit. I'm no prude -- i mean, despite the rumors going around -- but that thing was like, whoa. You know, I'm all for Justin ripping the clothes off of women, particularly when one of those women might be me, but tonight was... OH WHAT THE FUCK AM I SAYING? I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT AND WISHED HE TIT FUCKED JANET RIGHT ON THAT STAGE WHILE P.DIDDY STOOD AROUND TRYING TO SCRAPE UP ANY LAST BIT OF RESPECT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AND THROWN OUT A BUNCH OF "UH UH YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, UH UH."   urlLink Jason 's got a photo up already of this, but i'm gonna trump him with this one. Please look closely. It's like she's got SNE (spontanious nipple erection) and there's a star surrounding the nip that's about the size of her big areola. This, my friends, is my trump card:

          BLOGGA, PLEASE   This is a photo of  urlLink Greg the Boyfriend . Who may one day become Greg the Husband and then Greg the Anulled Husband and then back to Greg the Boyfriend. So let's just call him Greg the Boyfriend.  Greg the boyfriend got the best ever MASH results known to human kind:  You will live in  House.  You will drive a  punk rock girl out of her mind.  You will marry  a demanding bitch  and have  sexy  kids. You will be a  spineless bastard  in  the bedroom .  (you'd think he hates women or something...)  Today i've grown totally obsessed with  urlLink C.Lo 's "Mono." I dont have a clue what hit me, but this morning I listened to the song while reading the  urlLink lyrics  and just sort of felt like an angstful 15 year old again and started dancing around my room and singing along like I used to when I was in high school and hating things. It made me feel like a fucking million dollars.  I think we all sold her short. Like the only way Courtney could redeem herself after all the mess she got herself into was to raise the dead... but she made a fucking great song. That should be enough. It's enough for me. I even love the bridge of the song that I didnt like before. I fucking love the chorus. I will be DJing this gem tonight for sure.  And I'm so fucking excited for tonight's show. I don't think i could ever get enough of the Killers. They make my head go crazy sometimes because they're so good. Their last track on their album sounds like a song that David Bowie could've written. There are nights when I listen to it on repeat for an hour and drift off into vike enduced sleep. It's so pretty.

       COME TO A PARTY TONIGHT   Do you like to party? If so, please come to Bar 13 (on 13th and University in nyc) tonight at midnight for the  stellastarr*, ambumlance ltd., killers  after party! I think there's gonna be an open bar of stella beer at some point. So if you dont like to party but like getting drunk, this is also a good place for you to be.  I will be DJing along with LCD Soundsystem, DJ Oil, and Karibomb, and the Alex's (english and malfunction).   I've been dancing around my bedroom all morning, so I'm thinking that i'll probably be dancing throughout the day and until 4am. Please come dance with me, even though i dance like a drug monkey immitating ian curtis.

       HOW GAY ARE YOU?   According to  urlLink Spark's Gay Test  I'm 38% gay. Which might explain  urlLink my little escapade  with Leigh "Gone Wild" Lazark.  Catrinel sent me the gay test. Here's an IM we had:     Ultragrrrl:   i think i got a high score from touching someone's boobies.   scad carats:   apparently. this is an easier way to find out.   scad carats:   i think i got a high score from having sex with girls    Right. That should clear that up.  In something very ungay...  urlLink here are photos  from Mary's Tiki Wedding! They're very obviously the wave of the future.

      Thank you  urlLink Megadork  for posting  urlLink The Game of Mash  on your blog. So many hours in high school were spent playing this game. Most notably back stage during the Spring Musical and the Fall Play when I was doing tech crew and trying to figure out ways to entertain everyone.   Anyway, i did mash twice with two different numbers cause I couldnt decide if I liked the number nine more then three.   Here are my results:   Using the number  3  as my favorite number:  You will live in  Apartment . You will drive a  red hummer . You will marry  Ben  and have  5  kids. You will be a  dj  in  paris .  (I know about 40 Bens, so really, this could be anyone and they're all cute.)    Using the number  9  as my favorite number:  You will live in  Shack . You will drive a  pink subway . You will marry   urlLink Brian Montouri   and have  1  kids. You will be a  A&R  in  Paris .  (I was a bit more specific about which Brian. Coincedently, this Brian just stopped by my office to give me a drawing he made me of Neil Diamond ... he used his own pubic hair for Neil's chest hair. so sexy).   Please post your results in the comment box.

         THESE BUNNIES LOOK LIKE PUPPIES  I'm supposed to update my blog and discuss this weekend but i'm feeling totally uninspired cause there are some shitty people who like to talk crap on the internerd and it's making my head dizzy. So I'm gonna just sit in my glass house for tonight and hide all my stones. Actually, I'm gonna bury them.   I guess what I will mention is that I had a nice weekend. The weather was nice for the most part and the people were nice for the whole part and I went to the Killers video shoot for "Mr. Brightside" with  urlLink Karenplusone  and never got sick of hearing that song after 49 listens. She's got a pretty nice round up from the day. She's got a pretty nice everything if you know what I'm saying. You can see the photos from the video shoot  urlLink here . You might have to sign up for Ofoto for that, which is painless.  I honestly can't believe how much I love the Killers sometimes. They make me wanna never stop dancing. And nothing makes me happier then dancing. But it's not only the Killers, it's also Franz Ferdinand. FF make me so fucking happy that i want to run down the street hugging people.   "Almost Crimes" by Broken Social Scene is also fantastico plastico. the female vocalist is Leslie Feist -- she sounds so panic'ed and urgent -- it makes me want to cry. She sings like what heartbreak would sound like. Which reminds me, Mediaeater has some fantastic photos up from SXSW. Mediaeater is such a fantastic photographer -- you can almost hear the music through his photos. Look at:  urlLink British Sea Power  and  urlLink photos from the greatest show i've seen in five years  and  urlLink the Secret Machines  and  urlLink the Killers  and finally,  urlLink Broken Social Scene .  Speaking of lovely music,  urlLink Dennis Cahlo  is doing a residency at Pianos starting in April. He'll be playing in the upstairs lounge at 7:30pm on every sunday. For those of you who might be wondering who he is, Dennis used to be in the Realistics and I think that Niki and Lizzy are the two biggest Realistics fans ever... i mean, apart from  urlLink Audrey .  Also, I'm sad to announce that Nate the fantastic Roommate has found his very own east village studio. His departure is bitter sweet because this means that  urlLink Lindsay  is moving in. This is all very very exciting news. Lindsay is about to see how boring I really am and how I'm serious when I say "i like dating teenaged boys." I think i smell sitcom.  Whoa, so much for no update!

        IN STEREO GUM    urlLink Scott Stereogum  is DJing sunday afternoon at Pianos for the  urlLink Day After  Party. Johnny Cragg from the  urlLink twentytwos  is also DJing and  urlLink Poor Harvey  is performing. I dont know anything really about Poor Harvey, but after listening to one (1) mp3, I think they sort of sound like the Libertines. I like the Libertines, and i like their companion band Razorlight, so I guess I would like Poor Harvey.  Speaking of the Libertines...  urlLink A Tale of Two Hoachers  posted  urlLink this fantastic  link on their blog. Who are the Two Hoachers? Well, I know them. They're both british. One is from Essex but lives in London now, and the other is from Scotland and if it weren't for his fantastic skills as a writer/drinker/drunk you wouldn't be able to understand a word he says. I've made out with one of these hoachers, but that's not important. What is important is that they're pretty much the Libertines of the bloggaz, posting poetic gibberish mostly when drunk (and under the same name). A girl could only hope that they post more often, but alas, the Scotsman is a drunken stoodent and the other one is often busy attending to his hair. Please, you two hot men, please post more.  The link is of the two libs singing on the Jonathan Ross show.   Also, Nick Zinner from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is having a photography exhibition starting today and ending on April 3rd at Gavin Brown's Enterprise at Passerby - 436 West 15th Street, between 9th & 10th. I'm gonna check it out tonight before heading over to NJ for shabbat dinner. I'm expecting to see lots of photos of hotel rooms.

       FOR THE LOVE OF YAHWEH!   Will  urlLink somebody  please post their thoughts on last night's episode of "The OC!"?  I was at Pianos last night with a fuckload of blogheads when I called Greg the Boyfriend to see if he wanted to join me at North Six for  urlLink Sons&Daughters . He was like "call me after the OC" and i was like "why? it's a repeat." and he's like "no, it's a new episode!" and so i grabbed Guilia by the hand and we RAN to my house as fast as our little feet could take us and made it back in time for the second half of the show. Hi Alienhead, i'm sleeping with your mom buzz.  I met up with Greg at North Six for the Sons&Daughters show -- which was fantastic. It's like they listen to nothing but the "O Brother Where Art Thou" soundtrack and Gang of Four -- busting out a mandolin that made Greg weep and a passing around their bass guitar like a ho in a frat house. I was quite impressed to say the least by their male/female vocal charms, and i think their guitarist/singer scott has made it official: The Scottish are Producing Cute Boys. And lots of them. First Barry, then all of Franz, then J.Rice, and now SonsScott... and I wont forget the patron saint of scottish hotness: Ewan McGregor. Keep it coming, you kilt people, keep it coming.

       LONG TIME COMING       So I've finally jumped on  urlLink the Delays  wagon that I believe was started by  urlLink Karenplusone  about a thousand months ago. She played me "Long Time Coming" while we were in London in February and I was like "this chick is awesome, she's like a poppier stevie nicks and this song makes me wanna dance in a feild of flowers with fairies and cute boys with clean hair." and she's like "it's a dude." and i was like "great. i wanna make out with him... sober." Such dreamy vocals and sounds. Oh dear Delays, you make pot seem so expensive. who needs drugs when you've got this?   The poor people who have to sit around my desk have been listening to "nearer than heaven" and "long time coming" on a constant loop.   Last night I did Lindsay's Ritalin Readings which was so fucking fun. The house was totally fucking packed. I had no idea that people liked to watch other people read out loud. Whenever I read something to someone in my family they're like "let me just read it for myself. i can read." so the concept of someone wanting to watch someone else read for no reason at all totally blows my mind. But alas, there were about 100 people there waiting to watch us readers read. I gave a shout out to my bloggas and pour a little of my beer out for  urlLink Whatevs  who was in D-town.   Afterwards i went to see Americas Next Top Model with Karen plus one and cute Andy. I knew the winner would win from the very first episode. Sure, she's a little Stacker2ish, but she's like a total beauty cream campaign waiting to happen.  Then we went to see the lovely talented Johnathan Rice perform at the Living Room. Well, Andy didnt come cause he was sleepy but Karen and i sat up close and cooed every time he spoke from stage. He's scottish. Sounds like a mix btw ryan adams and chris martin and is 20. So effing endearing, it's painful. Karenplusone rounded up the night better then i feel like doing, so just go to her site. I will talk about the hickey's Sarah Wilson gave me though. Three of them actually. That was fun -- not really. She totally neck raped me in the front room of the living room and I left the venue with three gigantic bruises on my neck that are unsightly. this morning i had to do some tv thing for vh1 and the make up artist spent about a half hour trying to cover them up. i'm doing an mtv thing later today and so i'm thinking of rocking them sans make up and hair pulled back. my mom will be proud.  Go see Johnathan Rice next tuesday at the LivingRoom. You'll like it. And it's free.  Oh, and Muse's album came out yesterday. Go buy it.

       DEAR PITTY SING   I've been listening to your EP a lot lately. Prompted by guilt perhaps. Prompted by needing something fun in my ears. Prompted by many things. But basically, you guys are fantastic. Your music is fantastic.  urlLink Pitty Sing  you make me happy that I listen to the EPs that land on my desk. I'm sad I'll be missing your show next month, but I'm sure it will be fantastic and if I were there, I'd be upfront dancing the entire time.  And also, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. Love, Sarah

       I CAN SORT OF READ    urlLink Lindsayism  and  urlLink Jasper  are holding their first ever  urlLink Ritalin Readings  at Pianos tonight and were nice enough to ignore the possibly true rumors that i can't read. I can read. Sort of. Not well, but I can.  It's tonight starting at 8pm and readers can only read for 4 minutes each.   At 10pm, the impossibly cute  urlLink Johnathan Rice  will be performing right next door at the Living Room. The show is free and he's worth every penny.

       JUST BACK FROM AUSTIN   Alright, so i just got back from Texas. It was loads of drunken fun and loud music and bbq and little boys. Thanks to the readers of this blog who came up to say hi to me. it was so fucking awesome meeting you all.   Franz Ferdinand  put on the best show i've seen in about 5 years, if not ever. My memory is such crap, but i've never felt so much joy as when I danced to "Take Me Out" while the floor below my feet bounced and two people stage dove. The chemistry between Alex and Nick is unbelievable -- totally homoerotic and sexy, you could cut it with a knife. Mind you, they played the first night i was at SXSW, so they managed to raise the bar really fucking high for everyone else. Oh, and they played "The Dark of the Matinee" aka "Hava Neglia", which was extra fucking special.   The Hives  were absolutely amazing at the SPIN party, as were the Killers, the Von Bondies and the Bronx. It was one of the Hives' first american shows in a long time and the crowd was totally mental. I think i'd enjoy the hives even if i watched them on mute since Pelle is such a great frontman.  The Vice party was pretty fucking special as well. Set at some house just outside of the center of all the sxsw activity, death from above, the fever, and the stills played the backyard as cute people walked around everywhere drinking pabst and dancing inside the house to a great dj. it was like a high school party that you might see in a john hughes movie. thinking about it makes me want to cry.

          HEY GIRL, GET ON THE DANCE FLOOR   Is anyone going to see the following shows tonight in nyc?  urlLink Razorlight  at  urlLink Mercury Lounge  - 9pm  urlLink Johnathan Rice  at the Living Room - 10pm  I am so in love with Razorlight's single "Rip it Up" ... Yeah, sure, it does sound like the Libertines minus the homoeroticisim that Kiran loves, but it's got a beat and you can dance to it and it's probably about the  urlLink Queens of Noize ... and they're so fucking cute, i'd write songs about them too.  And Johnathan Rice is a 20 year old scottish FOSC (friend of saddle creek) who is a singer/songwriter and not typically up my alley, but i saw him play for starsailor a couple months ago and fell into a spell. I didn't like starsailor before this show either, so i'm thinking that it's possible that  urlLink Laura/temp  drugged my  urlLink sesame medallions .  In late breaking news, Baron talks about buying a  urlLink dust ruffle .   My goodness. C.Lo is totally  urlLink fooking nuts . Thanks to cumdumpster for that one.   urlLink This  doesn't seem too kosher. [link from  urlLink best week evs blog ]  Also,  urlLink Karen , where the fuck are you? Have you been kidnapped by the  urlLink TCTC ? If you know the whereabouts of this blogger, please tell me.  Did anyone see  urlLink "I Want a Famous Face"  last night on MTV? I would like to know, first of all, who pays for the surgery? Are the parent's seriously incredibly rich that they were like, "Ok, kids, we gave you really terrible genetics, so we'll pay for all these things to fix your weak features" cause to be honest, the boys weren't  that  bad looking. Granted, they didn't look like Brad Pitt before hand, but they didn't really look like him afterwards. But they did look pretty good afterwards -- i think they should've just tried getting their hair done and their skin fixed in the first place instead of spending all that dough on surgery. but that's just me... i mean, work with what god gives you before opting for surgery. Also, the porcelain teeth were totally unneeded. They had great teeth before hand.

       MY MILKSHAKE BRINGS ALL THE BOYS...   Member of  urlLink this band  seem to have won the good looks lottery. Sounds like Iceland is getting into garage rock.  I'm kinda surprised that I like the Fever's new album. I figured I only liked them live and not on record. But alas, their recorded material is hot.   urlLink This Milkshake  so so effing hilarious. This link is for the bassist of my favorite band.  Jews will do anything to save a dollar. Here's an IM i got from Adam:    adammandel:   i just stood in line for the 2nd ave. deli thing   adammandel:   it was insane   adammandel:   probably a 5 hr. wait   adammandel:   this homeless guy went down the line screaming "you are all crazy, its just a sandwich"    urlLink Safe for Work Porn , link from the perverts at  urlLink ProductshopNYC

       CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE    Muse just confirmed a show at Bowery Ballroom for April 14.  Please mark your calendars. No idea when it goes on sale. But  urlLink Jay Belin  is the fucking man for telling me.  This weekend Nate the roommate had a friend over from Tampa. We were hanging out in the kitchen and she asked me if i could recommend any albums. I drew a blank when every band i mentioned she had already played out. Then she came home a few hours later and was like "Hey Sarah, ever hear of this band called Muse? Virgin had their album on sale -- and it was an import -- and it's really great!" She heard the album on the listening station and fell in love with "Apocalypse Please" immediately. I'm telling you, the album is amazing. Anyway, i think Mandy and I are meant to be. We also both complained about the album's artwork. It's so ghetto. I'm no artist  (Mandy is though), and we both complained about the font. I guess that's not much, but for such an awesome band, i would want a bit more awesome thought into the font. They should've done "typewriter" font or something i think.  Oh, and  urlLink Laura slash temp  bought the album also and texted me saying how much she loved it.

          STOP ME OH OH OH STOP ME   So last night I totally DJed with 1/2 of the Smiths. Not only did I DJ with them, but I also danced with them to Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby" and exposed them to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer" ... Mike Joyce, who has seriously aged about 4 years, said "I like this bassline" and i replied with something nearing unintelligible like "this song is about 20 years old, if you think it's innovative, then it must be way ahead of it's time." I have no idea what that means AT ALL. Anyway, the rhythm section was sweet and posed with fans for almost the entire night and Andy Rourke, who grew his hair out long and wears tinted shades, played some Joy Division and Pulp and even played "Bigmouth Strikes Again." Holy crap. I pretty much spent the entire night freaking the fuck out and clutching Kris saying "Holy shit, i just met half of the smiths! holy shit!" Speaking of Kris, ich bin super fantastic. He brought me the "Take Me Out" single on vinyl that had a remix of my favorite song ever. Speaking of which, i may or may not have said "that's my favorite song of all time!" to mike joyce about "take me out." Not sure.   Cutest fan of the night: Jakob from  urlLink Surefire .  Oh, and dare I forget to mention that  urlLink Audrey  was an amazing DJ last night. She busted out George Michael's "Freedom" and got the whole fucking room dancing like they were supermodels... giving for what they take.  So I was thinking about it... if I went back in time 9 years and told my 15 year old self that I was going to be DJing with 1/2 of the Smiths the following conversation might happen:  "Hey Sarah, guess what, in 9 years you're gonna DJ with a couple of the Smiths." "Shut the fuck up! No way!" "Yes way." "Holy shit. What the fuck do i do until then?" "Well, you drink. And you drink a lot. You drink so much that you gain a few pounds, but it's ok cause you get boobies as a result." "Awesome."  Saturday night, after failing to find the location of Daniel's engagement party, I went to CBs to DJ the Good Time Party. The boyfriends came. Sarah came. This adorable girl named Dana and her boyfriend Justin came. People danced. People offered to buy me drinks and i happily allowed them to. Brunch at Clinton Street Bakery took a lot of energy out of me (but i look forward to eating there all week long...mmm...), that i slept for most of sunday before heading over to Pianos for the Day After party where me and my friends called each other cumdumpster.  urlLink Scott Stereogum  is such a cumdumpster.   Oh, and i forgot to mention that i saw Fight Club. I mean, Secret Window starring Johnny Depp with Hot Ben. We ate falafels instead of popcorn and pretend we were on a date. Johnny Depp is maybe the most likable actor ever?  What happens when Jay-Z and Weezer get mashed up?  urlLink Jay-zeezer .

Yesterday was the fucking gorgeous  urlLink Lindsayism 's Birthday (Happy Birthday btw, i know i text you and shit, but like, i'm blogging it now cause that's what we do, us bloggers). So i went home to NJ for some shabbat dinner with the fam and to give my ninja shihtzu some kisses, and then went into the city with my brothers so they could drop me off at Siberia.  urlLink Audrey  was rocking the wheels of digital steel and everyone was having a really fucking great time. I saw hot Ben, made out with cute  urlLink Andy , got into a near fist fight with  urlLink The Minor Fall the Major Dick . OK, that last part is not true, i dont think. But the bar owner kept on buying me drink after drink. Me so ill.

        WHAT WAS I NOT THINKING?   Introducing your new favorite band  urlLink Bloc Party .   Many, many, many months ago, my very hot entertainment lawyer friend, Oliver Isaacs, sent me an MP3 of a band called Bloc Party that didn't really care too much for. I think it reminded me of watered down Radio4. Then I found out that my friend Tim Vigon was managing Bloc Party, which surprised me cause they didn't seem up his alley. Then Imran was all up my ass about Bloc Party cause the singer is black just like him.   Finally, Oli sent me the link to  urlLink Flux Blog  where I found an  urlLink MP3 by the band .  Well, fuck me. I slept on that one, didn't I? Thank you to my british friends (who all have surprisingly fantastic teeth and shower regularly) for their pressuring.  And shame on me for not checking them out in London.

        RUMORS RUMORS   Someone from Berklee School of Music told me that Pitty Sing were not put together by the label and that they actually met in college. That story did seem a bit odd to me. The reason why I beileve MY source is because he doesn't actually like the band at all and is an old internerd friend.   So with that behind us, let's just hope that the band work on getting their live show down and make those EP fans, like myself, proud.

         SUPERSIZE ROBBIE?   I'm kinda loving the new Robbie. He looks sort of huggably soft or something. Like, you know he sort of wants to snuggle with you on his couch watching the OC. My theory with boys: skinny is fantastic, but if you wanna pack on the el bees, go ahead. Make me feel less... uh... you know, thick. To be honest, for a second I was like "ack!! get that man the von bondies album and have him do some sweating to the singles" because, c'mon, i loose calories listening to "C'mon C'mon" ... but you know, he's on vacation now. Let him pack them on. It's not like he can't get laid or anything as a result.   The only thing... doesn't he sort of look like a little person in this photo? Like Station Agent size.

         TAKE ME OUT   Jesus Christ. How the fuck did i manage to forget to mention that yesterday Franz Ferdinand's album came out.  Run out and buy it even if you own it digitally already.  Fuck that. I have a hard copy from the label, a vinyl single, an import... and i'm still gonna buy the album cause then i'll be supporting bands that deserve support, and Franz is one of those bands. Also, their $1.5 mil paycheck is grossly exaggerated. Believe me. And even if that were the case, they deserve every last penny. They're the modern day Smiths as far as I'm concerned.  Buy the album:  urlLink Here.  Now. Do it. Do it.   Look at how cute Kris Chen is:  urlLink Here.    urlLink Jasper  has some great photos of Franz Ferdinand:  urlLink Here.   Everyone loves Franz Ferdinand. Not only my homobro, but even TIME MAGAZINE. Their parent's must be proud. Read the article:  urlLink Here.

        C'MON C'MON   I've been meaning to post all day, and all last night, but the internerd has been whack. Basically,  urlLink Marc Spitz  got me the most thoughtful gift a human being has ever gotten me (not including family members). He brought me back from Los Angeles the tea cup that Morrissey drank out of during his interview with him. I was holding the tea cup in Sia's office showing it to her and miming how I would be drinking tea/coffee out of it when it dawned on me: Morrissey actually put his lips on that cup and it's never been washed. I literally started jumping up and down with more excitment in my mind than ever before. Seriously. I've never been so completely excited about an imanimate object before in my life. I think the last time I felt excitement like this was over an actual human being that i was actually in love with. How shallow can I possibly be? As shallow as a tea cup apparently.

         CONFESSIONS OF A....  ... Really Shitty Movie . Do not, I repeat, do not, go see  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen . It's not good. This is coming from a person who would rather sit at home ordering Mandy Moore movies On Demand and viewing the deleted scenes of the Olsen Twins' "When In Rome" than make out with drunk boys. I know my teen movies, and this one was... No joke, midway through the movie, Sarah Wilson stood up in her chair, wrapped her hands around my neck and mimed choking me. We sat there loudly critiquing the film -- as if we were suddenly Siskel and Ebert -- declaring a lack of character development and repeating the incredibly stiff line delivery and shitty dialog writing. In the end of the movie (yeah, i'm gonna spoil it for you all), Lindsay's character ends up with this school friend whom she realizes is reality while the rockstar she'd been pining for was a fantasy. Mind you, the school friend literally had about 4 lines in the movie, 2 minutes of interaction with Lindsay, and the two of them had just about as much chemistry as a pair of nickles stacked ontop of each other. This left Sarah and I leaving the theatre going "OH MY GOD, worst movie ever!" While a bunch of parents stared at us like "Uh... go see something your own age you fucking hags."

        SEEING DOUBLE. NO ALCOHOL NEEDED.    I was just looking at Greg the Boyfriend's  urlLink friendster page  and decided to look at his photos (cause I think he's cute and I haven't seen him in a long time and wanted to see something cute again) when I came across this photo. For a moment I thought "Wow, that boy standing next to Greg is really cute and looks a lot like Greg. I wonder why I've never met him before. I wonder what his story is. I wonder when I can make out with him," when I remembered... It was our last night in London and I had just professed my love to a boy and was drunk with thoughts of "what the fuck..." My belly was filled with sushi and sake and my shirt was covered in soy sauce. Needless to say, I was a wreck. Me and the boyfriends, Greg and Raph, went to  urlLink Trash  where I refused to drink and refused to dance and spent the night staring at the British boys who looked like Williamsburg hipsters and wouldn't even glance in my direction. I felt hopeless, unsexy, unhappy, uneverything and just declared that I wanted "to go home because I really don't feel like pulling tonight and throwing my heart around like that" (finally, right?). Anyway, in the midst of a post drunken, veering on sobriety lonesomeness, someone, maybe Raphael or Andrew or Marisa (Andrew and Marisa are both from NYC and came for the trip with us) found Greg Johnson's twin. We were in shock. We begged Greg to pose with his twin and scared the twin away by laughing and pointing. Finally someone approached the twin and tried to explain what was going on. The twin and his friends were foreign -- Italian maybe -- and couldn't really understand a word we were saying until someone pointed at Greg and then at the twin and it all clicked into place. Suddenly about 6 people were surrounding the two boys trying to get them to stand next to each other for the photo of the lifetime. Everyone, Americans and Italians, were freaking out over the resemblance. The Twins were unamused. Force was used. A photo shot. Greg is on the left.

        WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME...    ...how fucking awesome Asobi Seksu is?  Everytime they played a show it was either Shabbat or on a date that I couldn't make it, and holy shit, they were amazing tonight.  Like, better than amazing. They were like Interpol but fronted by a super hot Japanese woman and a little more harder. For the record, Interpol are my favorite band. But this band was fantastic and gave me that "close your eyes and listen until the strobe lights come on and then just get super fucking drunk cause it's also purim" feeling.     Also,  urlLink Dennis Cahlo ? Apart from the obvious "holy shit, he dedicated a cover of 'NYC' to me"... the boy sings like an angel. I was thinking that it must be really hard for some singers to have actual, genuinely fantastic voices in NYC because you live in such small quarters and can never experiment with your vox. However, Dennis's voice is as stunning as Thom Yorke's or Jeff Buckley's. Easily.    Anyway, that's what I did tonight. This afternoon I went to the Midnight Cafe with Lizzy to meet up with Brian and Grant for some brunch but managed to eat some of the worst eggs I've ever had. I'm usually really easy to please when it comes to food -- it's not uncommon for me to indulge in two meals at brunch -- but today i was like gagging to hold my food down. Also, I was in the middle of telling my posse about some great high school story that involved me taking 13 shots of vodka (with milk as a chaser) just so i could tell my best friend at the time that i had a crush on him... when the room went silent just as i said "in high school, my best friend hated VOMIT".... causing the entire fucking restaurant to turn around as if I was saying "I HATE JEWS!" or something. I mean, the entire fucking morning we had been yelling to each other about blowjobs and anal sex and like the most crude stuff you'll ever hear, and when i fucking say "vomit" the place goes silent. Naturally.   Whoa, Kid from Kid n Play hosts Showtime at the Apollo? Since when? Holla!  I'm not drunk right now. Lame. I should be. I'm on my fourth drink and bailed out of going to Misshapes. I think if i were there I would probably be passed out in a corner or making out with someone. You know, the normal night. I feel like I've had five years of those nights.

       SMILE LIKE YOU MEAN IT   Some things and then I'm going to bed (my lathargy prompted my mom to tell me that i was anemic when i was little... i had no clue!).  If you see  urlLink this girl , please tell the police. Hopefully she's alright.  I've got some DJ gigs coming up:   Saturday, March 6: Sin-e.  urlLink Asobi Seksu  record release party and show featuring Dennis Cahlo from the Realistics. Lots of hotness and cute Japanese people.  Saturday, March 13: CBGBs.  urlLink The Good News Party . Click on that link cause Alvin did this amazing animation movie and for the first time ever, I'm a bonafide cartoon, doing "the dance" that  urlLink the mystery girls  love.  Sunday, March 14: Tribeca Grand. This day will otherwise be known as the best day of my life this month.  I'm DJing with Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce of the Smiths . If  urlLink Marc Spitz  comes, he'll have met 3/4 of the Smiths in one month. The dude gets like 100 pts in my book for bringing me back the tea cup that Moz actually drank out of. Total Buzz.  Saturday, March 17: Chelsea Piers.  urlLink Fight Childhood Lukemia  and drink and dance the night away. I know that it seems a lot to pay $60 at the door for an event, but after that it's open bar and nonstop ass shaking music and most importantly, it's for a really great cause.  Well, that's it for March I think.

        FREE MARTHA!   Look. A little naked boy with a monkey on his head.   urlLink Martha  is guilty. My mom is gonna be pissed.  Last night I  urlLink had   urlLink a   urlLink bunch  of  urlLink bloggers/temp  over my house to increase my dorkatude. I played them the  urlLink Killers  album once and then they wanted to hear it again and again. Sadly,  urlLink Giulia  wasn't there to fawn at images of Brandon Flowers. Tim from London came over and so Sarah Wilson made her return to Apt #3a to celebrate. Also, someone made someone else puke and my toilet broke. I kicked everyone out before 1am because I like to sleep these days. And then i forgot that I was supposed to go to Remote Tavern to meet up with Brian and Catrinel, but eeek... change of pliz-ans.   I just got  urlLink Johnathan Rice's  album in the mail today. He's so super fantastic. Just a simple singer song writer with a voice that varies between Ryan Adams and Chris Martin.   First a 2 headed baby and now a  urlLink three headed frog ? Seriously people, time to start worrying about water pollution.   SARAH'S SO EXCITING NOW THAT IT'S PURIM AND BY JEWISH LAW SHE IS REQUIRED TO DRINK UNTIL SHE CAN'T SEE NO MO . Learn more on  urlLink Karen Plus One and Manishewitz .  And something  urlLink very cool  that Alex P sent around.

       I'VE GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDIER   I just got the new  urlLink Killers  album in the mail yesterday. Oh, not only did i get the whole mother fucking album, but i also got the music video for "Somebody Told Me" and have literally watched it several times in the first half hour of receiving it. They're on a desert -- but they're so hot already. God loves the Killers. I know it. Once you get your hands on this album you're gonna be blowing loads all over your keyboard while writing me emails saying "dear sarah, thanks for telling me about the killers." The last track sounds like the song Bowie never wrote.   OK, so the midweek report:  Monday: Went to dinner with Maureen and then went to see the acoustic  urlLink Morning Theft  (starring Rob Holmes) at Pianos. Rob's voice is so great and I am really starting to get worried that I'll be fucked waiting out in the rain to see them play in a couple months. They're like the Psychedelic Furs meets the Pixies -- which might sound really odd, but it works amazingly. Plus, as if they needed to win me over, they dedicated Muse's "Plug-in Baby" to me.  Tuesday: Ok, so Tuesday's plan was to meet up with my friends from high school since Allison Mann was in town from Boston. I had a work dinner first with the lovable Mikey Skinner from the Streets who looks like he has been going to the gym a bit cause his arms are looking diesel. I spent the entire night exchanging war-omance stories with Tim Vigon. Poor dude could hardly get a word in edge wise cause i spent the whole time going "...and then..."  So afterwards I went to Sin Sin to visit the high school friends, Evan, Cat, Marcus, Allison, Jon, and Noah. The music downstairs was whack and the music upstairs was so-so, so we headed over to lit where Marcus turned down free coke and Cat made out with some hot chick. I accidentally grabbed Evan's crotch for a photo. I swear it was an accident. Allison told us about teaching autistic children and I begged her to start a tardblog to make up for the one that ended. Autistic kids are not retarded, I know this. I like autistic people. It's assumed that many musical geniuses are autistic, so all those fantasies of Thom Yorke and David Byrne that I've had -- they were actually fantasies about autistic people.  Anyway , it was pretty fucking awesome to see my friends from high school. It's great that now I could blurt out "it's not that I hate only vaginas, I hate cocks too. I'm asexual. I'm like Morrissey" and they know who I'm talking about. In high school I think it would've taken me a bit longer to explain "no, not chris morrissey. I mean the singer. He's not gay. He's asexual. Oh nevermind. Do we  have  to listen to this live phish album  again ?"  Speaking of high school, I was interviewing Karen O yesterday and it turned out she went to the neighboring private school in Englewood. Not only that, but I was like "oh, you graduated in 96? Hmm... I think my friend's ex boyfriend was in that year. His name was Peter and I went to see his band play the battle of the band..." and it turns out that she knew this Peter. And when I was in high school, my friend Kim, who going out with Peter, gave me a tape of his band and there was this amazing song called "Karen" on it. I was like blabbering about the battle of the bands and his band when I was like "...wait a fucking second. Are you  the  Karen from the song "Karen"? Yup. She is. Amazing. Small fucking world. It was a great fucking song too. I haven't heard it in like 7 years and I could still sing it for you. Sadly, I think Peter gave up music shortly after that battle of the bands performance -- which I think he lost to a band that had a violin player. Fucking violin players.  And again with the high school theme of today's blog entry: last night I had tea with a friend from high school named Jason. Jason and I used to work at Seattle City Coffee together in Tenafly where we'd stand behind a counter at 6am serving pissed off parents their coffee while doing shots of espresso and avoiding "bad" touches by patrons and our boss. The positive thing about working there was that we had to have music playing at all time and our selections included the Beatles and Sinatra. I actually loved working there and would really love to go back to working in a cafe one day. I doubt Jason feels the same way.    After talking motormouth cocaine style to Jason for a half hour (I'm so sure he only heard me go "blah blah blah blah blah blah" -- that's all I heard come out of my mouth for the love of God), I ran home so I could catch American Idol. I'm so fucking happy that Dean Martin redhead dude, who likes Sinatra a lot, won. I was swooning infront of the TV as he sang that song. He's gonna win like Kurt from Norway did. Nobody expected it, but the dude had a fucking great voice. And This dude,  urlLink John Stevens , he's got a great voice. It's different from everyone's, obviously, and did you happen to notice that Nora Jones sold over a million copies of her album? This dude will too. I'm gonna go out on a limb and bet my money on it. All $17.50.   Then I dragged Lizzy into my room to watch "The OC" with me so I wouldn't have to shout across our apt going "oh my god! Did you see that!" every five minutes. Somehow I missed a "jewfro" comment from Seth *swooooooooon* Cohen. During a commercial break I made her watch the Killers video for "Somebody Told Me" and she thought the guitarist was cute. I tried to make her watch it again so I could be like "look at how cute they ALL are -- and yeah, the song is great too." But the OC! The OC was on! And then she predicted Marissa going over to that ho's house with a dress so she could come to the party. And then I predicted the Six Feet Under guy punching Ryan in the face. POW! Jordan texted me afterwards to say that he wasn't gonna watch anymore now that Anna was off the show. Dude, she's a blonde Rachel Leigh Cook.

       SO MUCH AWESOME    Thank God for the Queers at Bravo! who thought that sticking Ewan McGregor on a motorcycle for six episodes (or more) and following him around the world would make for  urlLink a great TV show . I think that me and my homobro (not to be mistaken with the republicbro) will have to TiVo this lovely show so we can discuss it during shabbat dinner.   Me: Dude, did you watch it this week? My Mom: Who? Homobro: Oh totally. My Mom: Who? Me: Ewan is like, five seconds from stripping off his pants. I'm so stoked. My Mom: Who? Me: Mom! Nobody! Ewan McGregor.  My Mom: Oh, he's cute. Me: Mmmm... yes. I love him.

       YOU MUST BE FUCKING KIDDING ME    Do you want to know what the big fucking surprise was on "Average Joe: Hawaii"? The big fucking surprise on "Average Joe: Hawaii" was that she fucking used to go out with Fabio. No fucking way that was our surprise. I was expecting cancer. I was expecting "i've got herpes." I was at least expecting "i've got another boyfriend back home." But NOT "My exboyfriend is Fabio." Who the fuck cares? Honestly, first of all, that's not something I would make public. Why did her hunk leave? Why did that matter? Honestly, somebody tell me. Was I screaming "No fucking way!" too loud that I missed it? I feel so robbed by the producers of the series. Note to producers: Next time you say "there will be a big fucking surprise" i want you to bring Fabio TO THE SET to fuck the girl infront of the guy she choose while his hair is blowing whistfully in the wind. That would be slightly shocking.

       DEAR JOHNNY DEPP     Dear Johnny Depp, Why are you so hot? Why must you taunt and tease all of us women who are not married to you (and who do not have your babies) with your total and utter hotness? Despite your hair being over ironed straight, and despite the fact that you have "wino forever" tatted up on your arm, and despite the fact that you have yet to donate your dna to "hotness research," i still love you. This is a love that grows stronger every day. Oh Johnny Depp, how i wish i saw that band that you're in. I would've been up front like I am at Franz Ferdinand and Killers shows and been going "You guys are awesome!" Please let me touch you.

       COACHELLA HELLA HELLA WORD   OK, I'm off to Coachella where, if you're going, you might spot me doing  urlLink this  at some point. You may also see me falling into about 40 thousand epileptic seizures due to the heat and incredible line up. I am not sure my heart can handle seeing Radiohead and the Pixies back to back, and then Muse and the Killers back to back, but if I die I'll be listening to The Killers as I float up to the heavens.  If you're looking for something to do tonight, I'm DJing at  urlLink Pianos  from 10-11pm.  urlLink Karen  promised to bring the Cooper Temple Clause by so i can see their hair up close, but I might be gone by the time they get there. Tonight will be a good night for you to "accidently" spill drinks on me incase I accidently spilled a drink on you in the past while i was drunk... or, if you know, if you walked at full speed into me causing you to spill your drink on yourself and got offended when i said "hey, watch out" in a cautionary voice because i dont really like to be run over by pedetrians, and it happens a lot since i'm really really short. Or if you were one of those innocent people who got hit by my drive-by beer shower at  urlLink misshapes  last week. I am SO sorry about that!  If you're gonna be in town this weekend, i strongly urge you to check out a band called  urlLink Snowden  at Plaid on April 30 or Pianos on May 1. I'm really sad that i'll be missing them and  urlLink Jasper  informs me that they're fantastic live. I suggest you at least check out:  urlLink "Kill The Power" , especially if you've liked anything I've ever recommended.  Alright. Say hi to me if you see me at Coachella! Bye!

         RASTERBATING IS FUN FOR EVERYONE!   My room is awesomely haunted now. I sort of want to do this to every wall of my apartment. so much fun. So much awesome. Ian Curtis watches me watch TV.  Go  urlLink here  if you want to try your hand at this really easy way to spice up your room for next to nothing.   you can take any image you want, blow it up, and print it on your printer using regular paper. it makes your image into pixels over as many sheets as you want (mine was about 56 sheets), and then you just tape them together. it's really simple. i recommend it to everyone!

        MAZZEL TAZZLE! JASON AND DEBBI ROTH ARE PREGGERS!   Sometimes I wish the world was as gorgeous as a British Sea Power song. I have no idea when I got so emotastic, but let me just sit and love on them for a minute. If, on our ascent to the pearly gates, any of us gets a pick of what we want for our soundtrack, I think today I would say "Please, St. John or Paul or whoever you are, please hook me up with some BSP." Tomorrow I might pick  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  or  urlLink Interpol , or any other band I'm growing increasingly retarded for, but today, today I'm requesting God hooks me up with British Sea Power.  Since I'm on a BSP kick, I decided that I would take a moment to see if the friendly neighborhood photographer, Jasper, had any photos of them on his site. The thing about the way  urlLink Jasper  takes photographs is that he makes every band look like they'll be as wonderful and majestic as  urlLink British Sea Power , yet he's never shot the band, and if he has, he hasn't graced us with their photos. Obviously, the other photos he has up there are well worth you wasting about a half hour trying to decide which one you wanted to  urlLink Rasterbate . I've sort of been obsessed with  urlLink this image  for some time, so last night, I did some rasterbation to it.   After I resterbated, I went to Pastis to meet up with Lance Crapo (whose name I'm putting here in full so when people google him they'll know the company he keeps). We had a lovely dinner outdoors and caught up on things as the wind blew receipts into our food and dust in his eyes. I never get to see Mr. Crapo these days, so the times I do are never long enough. Somehow he managed to push the right button on me which left me no choice but to attempt to do a round house kick to his head while standing in the intersection of 14th and Hudson as cabs tried to drive on. Naturally, because he's a ninja, he managed to capture my foot in mid swing, inches from his head. I wouldn't have kicked him hard, but just enough to teach him a lesson. Moments later we were standing outside of Lotus so we could attend some party for the anti-Mc Donalds movie "Supersize Me," that his brother's company did the distribution for.     Things that make me really happy today:  1. Jason Roth, the esteemed PR dude at Capitol Records, is pregnant! Well, not him, but his wife, Debbi. And she wouldn't have become pregnant if it weren't for him. Anyway, Jason is one of the greats in this world. You know the type: fun to be around, really funny, easy going, smart... his wife Debbi is his perfect match because she's all those things as well, but with boobs and now, with baby! The thought of them being parents makes me want to cry happy tears. That baby is going to be so lucky, especially since I promised to baby-sit it whenever they want. By the way, that's them on the left.  2. I saw a dog in a wheelchair this morning. It was this adorable blonde, long haired pug with bad hips that had this sort of cart for it's hind legs since the poor pooch had trouble walking otherwise. The dogwalker told me that the dog's doctor suggested to the owners that they put the dog down, they went for a second opinion, and now the doggie is happily wheeling itself around the lower east side licking the pee off trees. I wanted to kiss it's nose so bad.  3. 10 feet later, a dog walked by with a baseball cap on.   Anyway... Links time!  Teachers really need to  urlLink calm the fuck down . It's a pity the images weren't put on the net as well.  urlLink Alex  says: "Bush really BOGGLES my mind."  I saw  urlLink this dude  on the Today Show this morning and predict it will be about 20 days until he gets a TV gig.   Fuck  urlLink dry humping . Or is it, fuck, don't dry hump? I say, spoon. But that's cause I'm a prude.   urlLink Morning Theft  is playing at Pianos tonight at 9pm. I suggest you go see them now while you still have a chance.  A couple days ago  urlLink Karen  posted a  link to new  urlLink Killers video . I'm so behind on things, that i'm only now posting about it, but I'd like you all to watch it for one simple reason: there's a moment when there's this insane close up on Mark the bassist's package. It cause my office to squeal in delight and cause my jaw to drop. I'm not one to normally notice such things (who am I kidding?), but the cock shot is just not to be missed. Anyway, Karen and I will probably end up stalking Mark's package when the Killers join their new BFF Morrissey on the Lallapalooza tour.  Also, the Cooper Temple Clause have officially set up camp at Karen's house. I wonder if she's doing their hair while they're there.  Over at  urlLink the Daily Refill , the totally hot Jennifer has posted a link to a  urlLink ballad  about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen that is not to be missed.  Last, but not least, as some of you may have noticed, someone at the Black Table posted something about my lovely imagery of puking on ones mouth and then swallowing said puke out of excitement. I have since had correspondence with this writer. All is fine and lovely. I'm hoping she'll live up to my request that she think of me the day she pukes in her mouth and swallows it out of excitement.

       THINGS YOU DISCOVER WHEN YOU'RE TOO DRUNK TO SLEEP AND VH1 IS THE ONLY THING FUN TO WATCH   1. Gwen Stefani is really, really, really pretty. Dear God. I'm 24 right now and Gwen is about 10 years older then me. Do you think you could see to it that I age as well as she did? Her skin is really nice and she doesn't have any crows feet and she has nice teeth and she's skinny and she's a lot prettier then she knows when she's not wearing make up. Could you please give me like 10% of that? Also, she's so pretty, God, so good work with that.  2. Hoobastank's "The Reason" (not the album, the single) is actually quite good. On a normal day, I really dislike Hoobastank. Not only do i dislike their name (which is embarrassingly awful), but I typically dislike their songs. I find them pretty awful and redundant... but thankfully the modern rock ballad is allowed to be just that: redundand and awful, and still be great. There are so many awful modern rock hits in this world, but they're great, come on, you know it. And to prove that i'm not crazy (at least not alone), the other day  urlLink Karen  recieved a text message from me asking "who is that band doing the OC commercial song?" and then a few days later, after i found out who it was (and left her a text message at 3 am letting her know as well), she saw the same commercial and commented to herself that she loved the song and wondered who it was. And then it clicked. HOOBADOOBASTANK. Word.  3. OK, i just got the new Chris Rock special from OnDemand. Time to stop blogging. Night.

       MAYBE I WAS TOO DRUNK...   But I didn't see Micah (who is featured in the animated picture below) dancing at  urlLink Misshapes . However!, i did see the one and only  urlLink Uncle Grambo  and even danced with him to Blur and some other jawns. I wont even mention the extreme elimination dorkness that was at Pianos earlier in the night (if you want a hint, there were bloggers from all over the country gathered upstairs... i mean, all over), but I will say that holyshit, bloggers go to the bathroom a lot, and in numbers... together. I guess they like to watch each other pee.  Misshapes is fun.  Oxycodone/contin is bad.  And I'm still obsessed with the Iron Chef. Tonight's challenge? Oxtail. Yum. Maybe tomorrow they'll use frog guts.

       GET READY TO BE BUMMED    urlLink Denali  has broken up.  Here's a statement from their site:     Hey everyone.  We would like to start this by thanking all the fans who have supported us, listened to our music, and came out to our shows. Without you, Denali would not have existed. Unfortunately, due to differences in the band Denali cannot continue in the current state. This was an amazing experience for all of us, but it's time to move on and try something new. Please keep checking Denalimusic.com for updates, future announcements, and to pick up the remaining merchandise.  We hope Denali has meant as much to our fans as our fans have meant to us. Thank you all so much.  We also want to offer our sincerest apologies to Cursive, Darkest Hour, Mike Park, and everyone involved with the Plea for Peace tour for being unable to participate in something we believe in and felt extremely lucky to be doing.  With deepest gratitude, apologies, and appreciation,  Denali

        QUICK BITS   I might not have enough time to give a really meaty update today, so i'm just mentioning some quick things:  New York City's favorite teenage band,  urlLink Surefire , will be playing on Saturday at the  urlLink Misshapes  party at 10:30pm. They're not even old enough to dance there -- i'm not joking, they're like, sorting out prom dates at the moment or something -- but they're so fucking cute, oh, and they rock. My favorite Asian bassist, Alex Chow from  urlLink The Madison Strays , will be DJing with Ryan Rayhill. If you go here, you'll be happy... cause drinks are cheap.  Sometimes, I wonder if people like the movie TRON  urlLink way too much .  I like Pitchfork, but some of you might enjoy  urlLink Rich Dork . Link from my future husband Chris Kelly.  Kirk Cameron loves  urlLink God . Link from Gabrielle!  Check out  urlLink a cover  of Brit's "Toxic" that These Bones did.  Need money?  urlLink Here's a fun  and creative way to get some. Link from Adam Mandel.  I saw  urlLink Inouk  last night. They were great and reminded me of Dexy's Midnight Runners meets Edith Piaf, but not at all. I will discuss this band/show further at a later time.  I'm listening to new  urlLink Giant Drag  songs right now. Holy fuck. Have you all checked them out yet or what? They're unbelievable. They sound like a poppier Mazzy Star with elements of My Bloody Valentine thrown in. Sometimes Annie sings a bit like a mellow Kurt Cobain, and there's a song on here called "YFLMD" which stands for "You Fuck Like My Dad" and there's a line in one song that goes "Your dream, is my nightmare" ... which doesn't sound all that impressive here on this blog, but the way she sings it is just unreal. This is a band to watch.

        BEST NEWS EVER   Friends, co-workers, internerds. I have some fantastic news that will surely make you fucking stoked. Donnie Darko is  urlLink coming back to the theaters  with 20 extra minutes of footage! I just did that thing where I puked in my mouth and swallowed, that's how excited I am.  For those of you who might have overlooked Donnie Darko thinking it was just another Drew Barrymoore vehicle for silly teen horror movies, you're wrong. DD is a wonderfully tortured science fiction teen movie that takes place in the 80s and features music by Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Church, and much more. I think I cried the first time I saw it and even bought a DVD player just so i could watch it over and over again. Horay.

       STOP COLLABORATE AND LISTEN   I just found out that the Killers will be opening up for Morrissey in LA this Thursday and next Tuesday. All I can think is that Killer Brandon must be having a non-stop boner party of one. I have a rumor from a very good source that Morrissey heard "Somebody Told Me" on KROQ and called his manager and said he wanted whoever wrote that song to open for him. You can listen to the song that made the Mozzer quiver  urlLink here . Yeah, so don't get any crazy ideas that Moz reads blogs or anything. OK? Do you hear me you stupid little cunt with short legs and a fat ass? Nobody reads your blog. Especially not Morrissey. Only the members of Pitty Sing read you blog so they can track down your every move and figure a way to slay you in the streets.  Sorry. I went off for a moment.  Aren't the members of the Killers cute? I will marry one of them. Mark my words. Pun intended.  Last night I went to seen Snow Patrol with Nate-not-the-roommate,  urlLink Karen , and some big wigs from SPIN who supplied me with more beer then I could handle. I didn't actually attend the show with Karen as she refused to be seen in public with me, worried that people would find out about our torrid affair. So we sent text messages the whole time talking about how much we'd like to engage in a gang bang with the members of Snow Patrol. As the publisher of SPIN told me last night when my drunken ramblings were on full speed: TMI.  I've decided that I want a penis. I want one of my very own that I could use to procreate the world with. I dont mean that I want one that is attached to a boy, but one that is attached to me. A part of me. I want to be a boy. I'm sick of this girl thing. It's annoying and retarded and useless and my thighs grow whenever I eat carbs and I'm sick of that. I'm going to be a boy one day, mark my words.  I've been listening to Rival Schools' "Undercovers On" on repeat all day to celebrate my fantasy of being a double agent.  Jordan has  urlLink a blog  that's pretty funny. He's also: hot, jewish, 20 years old, and has great hair. He lives in Detroit and is single. Ladies of D-town, jump his bones.  Raphael is on the  TRL Front page . He's the  FAN OF THE WEEK !!! Ladies of NYC (and Miami for this weekend), Raphael is single, willing, and able. He's also the best dancer in the Lower East Side.  Speaking of MTV, please vote for  urlLink stellastarr* 's video for "My Coco" by going  urlLink here . I'm in the video! And so is the band.

        WE ONLY WORK WHEN WE NEED THE MONEY   What a weekend. I had one of those really great weekends when nothing is totally planned out, yet everything seems to fall into place just right. Friday night, due to technical difficulties, i was unable to return to NJ for shabbat dinner with the family. Instead, as i was sleepily heading home, i was beckoned by Imran to join him for the Johnathan Rice show at HousingWorks. J.Rice's shows are just getting better and better by the day... I think i've seen him about 6 times already and I'm never bored. Jason Roth pointed out that JR was wearing a blue tuxedo jacket to prepare for our wedding.   After the show Imran and I headed out for some mexican dinner, got drunk off sangria, and walked to the west village for some drinks with Tracey, Lizzy, and Sia, where I went on to help Marc take care of 2 bottles of Moet. JR and his posse of folk singers (including grammy award winner Jesse Harris) came to meet us and we all ended up getting into a near fist fight with the group sitting behind us after JR and I kept on throwing remains of a bouquet of gladiolas that i gave Marc at them. They were being really loud and we were being really drunk. They threw some stems back at us, but unfortunately their aim was way off and it ended up hitting some random dude. Exhausted, we piled in a cab and headed off to some east village bar on st. marks called St. something or other. I am not sure how I got home, but judging from a voice mail i received on saturday, I was put into a cab by a 20 year old scottish boy.  The next morning I went to meet up with Jason and his roommate Mike on 34th to see the cinematic masterpiece,   urlLink Saved  . OK, now Uncle Grambo is  urlLink yapping about  how Michael Stipe's duet with Mandy Moore on "God Only Knows" is a really bad idea, but he will eat his words when he actually sees the dark comedy. For one thing, Mandy is absolutely amazing in it -- I find her to be terribly underrated as an actress -- and so i think this will be some what of a break out role for her. Secondly, the cover, which plays at the beginning of the movie, is actually fantastic and totally tongue in cheek. Might it be slight Born Again Christian propaganda? Yes. Do I care? Are you kidding? by the end i was like, Praise the Lord!... for such a great film.  Thank you Jason for taking me!  urlLink Watch the trailer .  Speaking of Jesus, anyone see "Divas 2004" last night?  urlLink This  is what  urlLink Robbie Williams  was doing when Jessica Simpson performed his "everywhere but the USA" hit, "Angels."  Sunday morning I woke up totally hung over from the night before when I DJed at Opaline for the party where everyone walked around in their undies. I was up by 8:30 am, but didnt manage to get out of my bed  until 1:30. Had a smoke and wondered down to the Clinton Street Bakery for Brunch. People of NYC, if you haven't tried the brunch at Clinton Street Bakery yet, you must. Now. Yesterday. ASAP. Skip work and go eat there tomorrow. Just go. Anyway, I went alone cause the hangover rendered me retarded. I think I'm going deaf cause my friend said that he spent about 2 or 3 minutes saying my name before i turned around. Must keep my hearing. Music too pretty.  The thing i love about nyc is that you can just wonder around alone and find something fun to do. So I did just that. Found Vicki at a park. Decided that i'd walk over to fez to see if i could make a reservation for the Sarah Silverman show (it was sold out when i got there), ran into Hal who was waiting for  urlLink Jason  and invited me to join them. I went off to walk around st. marks, bought some clothes, found out the show was sold out, found hal and jason. Joined them for a bit. Walked towards my house and ran into a couple more people i know. Then went over to Pianos to see Dennis Cahlo perform.   Dennis is getting fucking awesome.   I liked his stuff loads when it was just him and the acoustic guitar, but last night was my first time seeing him with a guitar player and totally electricized. Great lighting, great sound... and best of all, fantastic lyrics.   Anyway, what I'm trying to say is: I love this city.  And now for some slightly random links.  Remember SQUIRT TV on MTV? Well, Jake Fogelnest (or Mr. Squirt as he asks his friends to call him) promises that  urlLink something is coming .  Don't miss THE FACE magazine? Maybe  urlLink this cover and photographs  of Wino Forever will help you.   Franz Ferdinand  urlLink edited the Guardian  and put in  urlLink a gash and a penis .   Is Thom Yorke standing on a box  urlLink in this photo  or is it a matter of depth perception? You decide. You can get the poster of that image at  urlLink WASTE headquarters .  Wanna go to NYU? Prepare to  urlLink homeless  by reading this dude's blog.   urlLink

       THE NEW SCOTTISH GENTRY   You all might know about  urlLink Barry , my once-teenaged Scottish boyfriend from Glasgow who looks like Nick Jago of BRMC and speaks in an accent so thick that he could only be understood when:  1. Drunk 2. Drunker  Well, the reason why Barry won my heart and the hearts of many of my friends was through his writing. Ah yes, Barry writes words like Mozart writes a symphony. Once apon a time, it was only through purchasing issues of the NME or recieving lengthy emails that one could read Barry's musings, but now, my friends, now  urlLink Barry has a blog . Feast your eyes on it. I should add that he writes that blog with another person who lives in London who would rather go uncredited... this person is referred to as "London."

        A NEW YORK MINUTE   First thing's first: This morning I was watching TV and they had a commercial for the theatrical debut of the next Olsen Twins movie. It looks so good, I'm not even kidding.  Last night I had some "Break the Bread" Passover's over dinner at Thai On Clinton with some usual suspects ( urlLink Brian ,  urlLink Lindsay , Greg the Boyfriend, Ben, etc.). We discussed such wonderful dinner topics as "sex in the bathroom" and "sex in a corner booth" and "how to raise your two year old" and "Payas: Bringing home a jew girl to your jewish parents and passing her off as your girlfriend (the beard)."  Afterwards Elliot and I hopped into a cab and jetted off to the Secret Machines/Blonde Redhead show at Bowery. I can't believe how un-stoned I was for this show. I showed up more sober then I've been in ages and was like "whoa. so this is what the secret machines sounds like when i'm sober? Awesome." They're totally Flaming Lips meets the Queens of the Stoneage stoner rock that sounds as good with your eyes closed as open (which is convenient when you're 5'1 and can't see anyway), but I'd just like to give extra props to the low budget lighting set up that was actually way better then most lighting set ups i've ever seen. Basically it was like their accountant said "OK, we've got only enough in our budget to afford a kingsized bedding sheet and three spotlights." At one point the backlight lit so perfectly making their silhouettes glow with an almost angel like quality. I was happy that I opened my eyes for that part.  Anyway, here are a bunch of links that you may or may not enjoy.   urlLink Live video  footage of a couple songs that Muse managed perform at the Atlanta show before Matt Bellamy split open his face.    urlLink An update  on the status of the cell phone attempted robbery hottie.  For those of us needing a little Lloyd Dobbler in our lives, now you can  urlLink wear him .  Looks like Nicole Richie and Justin Guarini are getting hitched.  urlLink Buy them a gift .  Ewan on a hog for his new  urlLink tv show .  For those of us who wondered "Could Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos get any hotter?" the answer is clear. Stick him in a school boy outfit and he actually gets hotter. Check out their new  urlLink video for "Dark of the Matinee" .  If that link doesn't work, try  urlLink  this one .  And then there's the British Sea Power  urlLink video  for "Childhood Memories" that my brother Lawrence is freaking out over. There's something absolutely perfect about BSP that makes me really fucking happy to be alive.   When I was 19 or 20 I was totally obsessed with a little group called Soulwax, then they became the international DJ duo known as 2ManyDJs. Finally they've recorded original material that you can hear  urlLink here . [link via  urlLink Fluxblog   For those who want to know what college is  really  like...  urlLink go here . I went to the Fashion Institute of Technology. It was awful. I've blocked it out of my mind so much that I'd rather tell people that I didn't even go.  Finally,  urlLink JasonProductShopNYC  was kind enough to  urlLink put up a link  to where you can download last night's Pixies show. Unfortunately, i have no idea how to work "bit torrent", so if anyone can help...

So hold tight to your tickets and be sure to check out the opening band  urlLink The Exit  (I'm wearing their tshirt today actually).  urlLink This video  shows what happened in Atlanta that is causing all the worry and fuss. Poor boy.  Thanks to  urlLink Paul Hanly  for the link.

       YOUR COVER IS A WONDERLAND   Alright, alright, alright. I know that John Mayer's cover of "Kid A" is about 4 years old. I got an MP3 of it before any of his singles even hit the radio waves and engulfed us with thoughts of wonderland-like bodies belonging to Jennifer Love Hewitt because I used to be insanely obsessed with Radiohead and would sit on napster all day long looking for Radiohead covers. (Actually, I remember now that Daniel the Orthodox Jew sent me a copy of the mp3 cause he's got the inside track on shit like that.) Anyway, back then I thought the cover was fantastic and today I still think that the cover is beautiful. I know it's not particularly "cool" to like John Mayer, but fuck being cool. Maybe it is cool. Maybe it's so uncool that it's back to being cool again. Either way, I'm treating this cover as an isolated incident. I got it today in the mail from Columbia as part of some sort of 5 song EP for "Clarity". Try to find it. I promise all Radiohead fans that it's worth it and not total sacrilege. If you disagree, which you might, please feel to post your thoughts in my comments section.   Here's a  urlLink killer surprise  for you.

       ALWAYS CRASHING THE SAME CAR   If you liked  urlLink Marc Spitz 's novel  How Soon Is Never?  (which most people do) then you'll probably want to know what Mr. Spitz is up to next. Here you go:  urlLink details about his new book . I'm stoked.  Still in Miami. I baby sat my cousin's 20 month old daughter last night and fell asleep while watching "Iron Chef." Watching them prepare live octopus made me puke in my mouth a little bit. They squirm for like 20 minutes after their heads have been chopped off and their tentacles have been sliced up. Just moving and squirming for dear life. Yum. I think. Octopus isn't kosher.

       C'MON ITS TIME FOR SOMETHING BIBLICAL   T-Minus a couple of days before Muse play NYC and the Mystery Girls in Philly have emailed me saying they bought me a ticket to the Kyber show and are insisting i come down for that. The offer is enticing.   Passover in Miami has been a lot more work then expected. My mom has been working me and my brothers non stop (the amount this woman can cook and clean is shocking), and my tan just isn't happening. I'm looking out my window right now and there's a pretty heavy overcast at the moment, but the beach is about 50 feet away, so the second some clouds decide to part ways I'm running out the door.   All of my family -- from my mom's sisters and brother and cousins to my dad's sisters and brothers and cousins -- is here in the same apartment complex. They sit by the pool talking in arabic and nagging about something or talking about their kids. My cousins -- who are my age -- are either looking for husbands or schlepping their kids around. Adorable kids. I can't keep track of their names half the time, but thankfully most of the boys under the age of 15 are named Morris.  My first night in Miami I went with my brother to a sort of Matzah Ball at Tantra. It was like a meat market for Syrian Jews from Brooklyn who were all there to meet their future husbands and wives. I was pretty much the outcast of the bunch because I never attend these functions so nobody knows my deal. I guess it's for the best since I'm not really in the market for a husband... despite my mom's begging. A few of my cousins showed up and it was awesome seeing them because I dont really get to that often... but after a couple hours of the untz untz, i had to go home.  The following night I met up with one of Brian's friend's, Monica, at a party called Spider Pussy. It was a total nyc party with cute kids dancing to indie rock and new wave. Josh from Revolver, whom i had met a couple months earlier at Lit, was there and we hung out a lot of the night. He invited me to DJ for a bit the next night (last night) at Revolver, which was fucking nice as shit, so after shabbat dinner with my family Lawrence and I drove to the design district and partied it up tiswas style over there. Revolver is a totally fantastic party that's probably the sanctuary for most Miami kids who would rather listen to the white stripes then ace of base. All my friends who have either lived in miami or visited insisted that i check it out and i'm so glad they did. I had a fucking great time and Josh is a great host. I haven't seen a club with such a great set up in so long that I was in club design heaven. Plus, the DJs were totally fantastic and everyone was so nice and all the girls had fucking fantastic little bodies that -- even me and my raging heterosexuality -- was like, whoa. My bro fell in love with this mohawked lesbian who made his night by making out with another girl and then taking off her top. Miami is awesome.  Not sure what's happening today in my little adventures in Passover. Hopefully the sun will come out, i'll sit underneath it with my 20% russian blood trying to hold on to the incredibly fair skin that i have, and tan. Viva Skin Cancer!

       GOLDEN GIRLS AND ME   So i think this is gonna be the last time I blog before going to Miami for a week -- Unless someone in my family brings a laptop... which is totally possible. However, not sure postings like "sat on the beach today and got a little sunburnt, lizzy is gonna be pissed. my mom made stuffed peppers. yum. my name is sarah and i've been sober for too long at this point" would be all that interesting.   Last night I had such an amazing time at the very very dark Centrofly. I carried around a plastic champagne flute because on some vh1 special that i saw earlier that day, they were saying that the new pimping accessory for hip hops stars to have is a goblet displaying the owner's wealth. I felt like a plastic flute said a lot about me: broke and cheap.  Anyway, I danced to Audrey and Dennis' DJ set and really got blown away by Bastion and the Madison Strays. The MS are getting better with every show and Belvy's voice and stage presence is really starting to shine. Plus, Alex Chow's new haircut = total buzz.  DJing with Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke was really fun. At one point they came up to the DJ booth during my set to prepare for theirs so I dropped "Bigmouth Strikes Again" anticipating their reaction. Thankfully it was totally positive. Mike grabbed my waist and started dancing and singing along with me. It was totally surreal, but perhaps not as surreal by the numerous kisses the dude planted on my drunken head. They were friendly kisses. Very friendly kisses. The kind of kisses that my brother normally saves his "my fist/your face" looks for. At one point he walked me into a corner of the DJ booth -- I was stepping backwards and tripped over someone's jacket and knocked my head really fucking hard on some wood, and nearly blacked out for a moment actually -- as he reached down to help me up he said "I'm so sorry, I was just trying to give you a hug!" i replied "that's alright, you gave me a concussion instead!" I hugged him goodbye and thanked him for being in the band that saved mylife "well, you and radiohead and nirvana all saved my life... so thanks so much!". I'm older now, and a clever swine, but they were the only ones who ever stood by me.

       ... ON BEING KILLED   I'm finally updating.  I'm going to Miami next week to spend an Atkins friendly Passover with my family and working on my (un)healthy glow. If you know of anything going on next week in Miami please post it here incase I get bored of looking at the waves and my family's faces. I'll be rocking the potato vodka, holla!  Wednesday I went to see  urlLink the Killers ,  urlLink Ambulance LTD. , and  urlLink stellastarr*  at Irving Plaza with  urlLink Karen . I seriously can't get enough of the Killers. I want to take a month off work and follow them around like a fucking deadhead smelly hippy or something. If the  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  show was a homoerotic experience (it was), then the Killers show was the straight equivalent. I just danced around with the biggest stupidest grin on my face for the rest of the night and felt like I had just given birth to a gorgeous baby of rock that i quickly disposed of in a dumpster so could continue my night. I want to stick the members of the Killers (and their roadie and thier manager) in a box and keep them there so i could poke them every hour or so and be like "give me love," and they'd promptly start singing and playing their instruments and I'd dance around and scream "you guys are awesome!" until i had to get back to work.   Ambulance LTD were also quite great. I haven't seen them perform for almost a year and I was just in such a good mood after the Killers that they could've put on a shitty show and I would've been floating... but luckily they actually put on a lovely show. I felt like i was in some sort of sixties movie about california or something.  And then stellastarr*.... Dear stellastarr*, i have a problem with you. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SO FUCKING GOOD? It's criminal. I used to go see them play at Luna and Arlene's and they were great then and I was like "they're great now. they'll get better." but their show blew my expectations. My brother, naturally, was bouncing around like a monkey on a trampoline with Seth. I think they enjoyed the show more then anyone. Also, their new song, "On My Own" (not to be confused with the american tale song sung by fivel), is fucking great. That was my first time hearing it and Killer Brandon had warned me that that song chokes him up each time. I started tearing up and looked behind me at Nina and Gina and started hugging them. Oh, the love.  The after party was open bar and since I was DJing I didn't really have to pay. So i played a bunch of songs and danced around like I had a seizure (in my head, i can totally dance), drank a lot. People bought me drinks, which was fucking great, thank you to those people. Killer Dave and his tight pants showed up with Killer Wyatt and we danced with Mandystarr*, my brother,  urlLink Audrey  and  urlLink Brian  (whom I flashed my troll-like ass to at some point), and Karen finally met  urlLink Scott . Not in that order. I think i just bloggerfucked. Fuck. Blogga, please. I'll drop as many blogs as i want. Watch me! We're all a bunch of nerds anyway.  Including the DJing, I was in full on work mode since I'm doing a "making out with ultragrrrl" for the three bands... the ironic thing about my column is that I don't actually make out with anyone. For one thing, i'm not allowed to for ethical reasons (which I'm actually quite interested in being -- ethical), and secondly, despite the way I write and talk about bands, i've been known to run far away from boys who play instruments. I just don't date musicians (I'm even more scared of dating actors). This makes my job so null of temptation. Now if I had to cover unemployed artists with "substance abuse problems" for a living... I may have a problem on my hands. As far as my parents are concerned, I only date Doctors. Hey  Andy .  Last night I went on this Booze Bus thing that SPIN organized. It was basically a bus full of high end sneakers by Royal Elastic, put on display like it was an A-Life shoe store, and college students who were visiting SPIN from RIT, and a bunch of people who work here, and a lot of booze and the  urlLink Ravonettes . It was one of the more bizarre work experiences I've ever had and I was trying hard to channel my 17 year old self who would've thought that working at SPIN was like this every day of the week. It sort of is, but replace the bus with my work desk, the booze with coffee, the sneakers with cds, and the ravonettes with Tracey Pepper and Sia Michels. Not really bad actually! Cept, in my fantasy nobody laughs when I say "Muse is one of the best bands out there."  Then I went to Irving Plaza to meet up with Craig from the fine University of Connecticut. I had to duck into a bar to use the bathroom which overflowed like a horror film or something. I had just enough time to wash my hands and run out, tell the bar guy "dude, the toilet's broke." When I went outside i started telling Craig what happened when some totally cute boy walked by and said "why don't you blog about it?" So here I am. Really, i'm only blogging about it cause i thought it was funny that some random kid said something. I'm pretty open to suggestion sometimes.  So Craig and I went to Link to eat dinner and drink some beers and then met up with Sarah Wilson at Irving Plaza so we could swoon over the  urlLink Walkmen . J'adore le Walkmen! I have no idea why, but Hamilton reminds me a bit of Mary J. Blige when he sings. I think i just think of MJB's performance on some VH1 special a few years back that seemed so desperate and wonderful and there's something about the way Hamilton sings that's very much like that. To me at least. Strangely, it was the Walkmen that made me love Radiohead less. They were doing things that Radiohead stopped doing after  OK Computer . What I mean is, there was something missing with  Kid A ... like humanity.  OK Computer  changed my life completely. It's because of that album that I took working in the field of music seriously (in all honesty, it was my goal to meet Thom Yorke as a teenager so i could thank him profusely for filling some void that I didnt even know needed to be filled). There were endless mistakes on  OK Computer  that made them seem pure, and it seemed like there were none on  Kid A . Or the sparkle was gone. Something. The Walkmen tho, they were doing something pure and organic. They sound like a drunken night in love. But you know, maybe my taste just changed.  Is it weird that i still love Muse?  Alright. Time for me to go home so I can have shabbat dinner with my family and kiss my doggy on her nose and hear my dad say "i dont understand what happened... you used to be so ... skinny." and hear my mom say "it's all the drinking you're doing." and then hear my brother say "yeah, you drink like a fish." and then talk to  urlLink Laura  on AIM about teenage boys.   urlLink Here's  The Exorcist   in 30 seconds, re-enacted by bunnies for a special rabbit loving friend of mine.

       SECOND SPINOFF!   I now have a second spin off! This is exciting. Yesterday my friend Niki moved in and started a  urlLink blog of her own .  As she blogs, my book shelf collapsed, my cell phone dropped in the can, and i probably managed to have a third fuck up along the way that I forgot to take note of, because, things happen in threes, right?  I went to  urlLink Misshapes  last night to dance and dance some more. I ended up staying until 4:15 am cause the DJs were just pumping out the hits. Anytime "Violet" by Hole gets played, you know you can't go -- not just yet.  I met Andrew, the bassist of  urlLink Pitty Sing , last night. Told him how much I fucking loved his EP and apologized for the not-so-pleasant review I once gave his band's live show. The EP is really fucking good and I wish them the best of luck. I suggest you get it asap. Or at least check out any song clips on their site. They're kinda like Frankie Goes To Hollywood-ish... and i mean that in a really good way.  Right now  urlLink Lindsay  is playing  OK Computer . I fucking love that album more then ... stuff.

        I'M NOT OKAY   Go to  urlLink My Chemical Romance's  website to see their new video for "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" (it's in the pop-up window by the way). You can also hear about 3 of their new songs, and I'd like to recommend "Helena." That song is unbelievably good. Umm... I should probably warn you that MCR is what some might call "Extremo" ... only really really really good and people who like Muse might actually appreciate them.

       EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT   It's friday and memorial day weekend and I want to go home. So I wont be able to give a full and chunky recap of last night. I saw  urlLink The Bravery  last night at Arlene's Grocery. It was the last show of their month-long residencey and the place was PACKED with industry. So much so, that I had to sneak in when the door person turned her back, and my friend Paul had to sneak in by going through the backstage entrance.  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Jenny  couldn't even get in. From what I over heard, there were 75 industry names on the list, including label presidents and I recognized half the A&R guys in there from back when I was  urlLink managing   urlLink bands . So you're probably wondering what they sounds like... right?  OK, so they're basically very similar to  urlLink The Killers . There are three mp3s on the site that  you can listen to that are really great. Anyway, watching them, with thier Tears for Fears hair, Adam Ant haircut, I felt like I was my brother in 1986 or something. Not bad and no complaints coming from this blogger... I gotta wonder tho, was this frenzy caused by the expected success of the Killers?   Anyway, it's interesting to see how waves of music travel.  After that, Paul and I hopped over to Bar 13 where I was DJing for the 4th Anniversary party.  urlLink Photos Here . I caught some of the Unisex Salon show, and they were ALSO very great. It was like a great night of random rockshows!   I played tunes and tried to dance and get into it, but a sort of situation was in front of me that made me sort of not in the mood. It might've actually been accented by the Red Bull i drank before arriving (which i tried to counter act with two beers... that didn't do the trick). I also found myself leaving richer then when I arrived ... which was without a cent to my name, so i was pretty happy. However some girl tried to beat me up when she saw me and  urlLink Greg  dancing. I had no choice but to laugh. I wasn't about to shed any blood on the dance floor, and I'm a good fighter. Anyway, I don't want anymore drama in my life, certainly not any of the physical variety.  There are like a thousand other elements to this story that include pinky swear promises that were forgotten moments later and you know, things of that variety that sent me running out of the club by a 2:45. Tis a pity since I was having a fucking great time and Michael T was spinning a killer set.  I'm DJing on Sunday night at DON HILLS. Please come. It'll be really fun and it's super cheap.  Click  urlLink Here  for more info. Bunch of bands. Cheap drinks. Dancing naked girls. Good times.

       PROCESSING   I'm still trying to process last night. Once it's been through the head about 94 times, i'll be able to blog. The strange thing about me is that I never over analyze anything. I'm like a dude that way... but sometimes your nights present something that's very confusing.

      This morning was one of those mornings when I woke up and looked at the ceiling thinking "Where does this story begin? How did i get here?" To be honest, I wrote that sentence a few hours ago and have the worst case of ADD today that I just haven't been able to write beyond that line. Now I've had a cup of coffee and am gonna try my best.  So I forced  urlLink Karen  to drop her plans and join me for the Living Things/Velvet Revolver show at Roseland that night. Her plans, previously, had consisted of going to BBKings to see the singer of Squeeze perform an acoustic set. As if she  reallly  wanted to do that! So after work I went with the co-workers to Passerby in the art district for send-off drinks for those who have decided to leave SPIN. I decided to make it an "exception night" and had a couple of beers and a half hour later i was on my way to the show with my editor, Doug, to meet up with Karen.  You know how in the 4 questions of the Haggedah you ask "why is this night different from any other?" (well, you might not know if you're not a jew, but we ask that). Well, Karen and I stood around asking just that. There we were in a venue we both know all too well, and yet, there was not a single familiar face in the house. Thankfully, I was already sauced and hyper from the beer and redbull i had ingested that i sort of bounced off the walls.   The main reason I went to the show was to see my friend Eve's band, The  urlLink Living Things . I hadn't seen them since they opened for the Libertines back in the summer when Barry was still 19. Doug had seen them at CBGBs a couple weeks earlier and said it was one of the best rock shows he's ever seen, so I was like "hot damn! i'm coming!" i mean "I'm going!" or whatever. Their show was great and Lillian, Eve's brother (btw, Eve is a dude as well, and their brother who plays drums is named Bosh), is a great frontman. He stripped off his shirt and performed topless much to mine and Karen's pleasure, and even brought out a couple of ladies dressed in lingerie and Bush and Rumsfeld masks who started to dry hump each other on stage while Lillian took a gun shaped lighter and lit a photo of the President, during which he urged the audience to not vote for Bush. To give you an idea of what the crowd was like, some meathead started calling Lillian the "n" word (which is beyond bizarre for many reasons including the awfulness of that word and the fact that the only thing black about Lillian is his clothing and maybe his ability to grow a jew-fro). Anyway, that audience member is a retarded pussy who refused Lil's request for him to come on stage and duke it out. This dude's friends were beyond embarrassed according to band members who saw the whole thing from stage. The thing I didn't like about the show, which wasn't the band's fault, was that you could hardly hear them. Apparently the VR didn't want the openers to be louder then them.   Karen and I walked around a bit, did a bit of people watching, and I spotted someone who looked really familiar. "Hey look!" I said to Karen, "It's the singer of the Charlatans UK!" I went up to see if it was him. He said no. I walked away thinking "that's so weird, it looked just like him." Um... Yeah, i'm a total douche. It was the singer of the Stereophonics and I totally got the bands confused. Yeah, guess who's a fucking retard. Me.   Anyway...  So the Velvet Revolver took to the stage and Weiland, who is undeniably hot as fucking hell, came out dressed like the gay police officer from the Village People and started doing his snake dance. Karen and I spotted this dude walking around with the tightest pants ever, cowboy boots, and a furry jacket with no shirt on underneath. He looked like the love child of Justin Hawkins of the Darkness and Rob Harvey of the Music AND Slash. I ran over to him so i could get a photo with him cause his look was just too unbelievable, and he was more then excited to pose with us. The boy was created to be photographed... and the boy had a sort of business card that was his photo and web address. The boy's name was  urlLink Lips Velvet . Please check out his website so you have an idea of what the fuck i'm talking about.  After I posed with Mr. Velvet, Eve came to get me and Karen to bring us to the VIP area, but Karen decided that she had enough of the Velvet Revolver and decided to head down to the east village for the Radio4 listening party at HiFi where she canoodled with famous hipsters and tried to convert them all to H.I.M.... meanwhile, I failed at turning down Eve's offers of alcoholic beverages (he's like "I KNOW FOR A FACT that you have "exception" nights for your drinking. I read your blog. This is one of those nights. Now what do you want?" bless that boy). I danced like a snake with the LivingThings as we freaked out whenever the VR played G'n'R songs or STP songs... and especially when they covered Nirvana's "Negative Creep." Does Tommy Hillfiger have a brother who looks exactly like him? Cause if so, he was there with Michael H, who is NEVER without his sunglasses apparently. Also, Cory, who is not a Berlin Brother but from St. Louis and in the Living Things, looks exactly like a younger and healthier version of Scott Weiland. It was uncanny. He's officially the New Cory. As in, move over Corey Haim and Feldman, there's a new Cory in town and he spells his name without the e.  After the show I went with the Brothers Berlin to the Hotel Gansevoort for the Clive Davis/Velvet Revolver party. We loaded up on the booze and chased the dudes down who were carrying plates of food since we're all broke and I forgot to eat dinner that night. The party seemed like something out of a Hollywood party and so i drank to forget where I was. Whenever I go to these events, the record company parties, I'm like, "oh, i really dont belong here." and wait patiently for someone to realize that I've crashed the party and kick me out. They never did. I swear, the next time i attend a party on that deck, and it's above 80 degrees, i'm jumping in the pool with all my clothes on. Up until now, NYC just hasn't really bought into that whole "hey, my name is mr. weather, i'm gonna be hot now," instead, i've been wearing lots of layers.    urlLink Justine D  showed up and brought some of her own personal sunshine. It's always lovely to see her! When we were all fed up with the free food and booze we all hopped in cabs and headed off to Plaid, which was really empty, and i gave up and went home leaving the kids dressed in black to wander the streets alone in the rain.  The end.  By the way, I just got the  urlLink Sons&Daughters  EP and it's really fucking great. I guess the songs I downloaded off the internet just didn't do their recording a lot of justice because the EP totally captures the live show really well. I mean, you dont get to see a quartet of half really hot boys and half really hot girls singing and dancing while you listen to it, but it's close enough. They're gonna tour with  urlLink Franz Ferdinand , so be sure to check them out.   urlLink The Killers  were on MTV a couple days ago as a You Hear it First. I haven't been able to find the link to the segment, but if you go to their website you can see their music videos. I'm going to a prom with Mark Killers. I'm excited!  If Dan Marcus were still in high school, he would've jumped on a plane to find this  urlLink gigantic mushroom .  Someone thinks that  urlLink Damon Albarn  is a cunt. They may or may not be right, but either way, he's still fucking hot.  Rob from Morning Theft has gotten me into the Sheila Divine again. Please check out their song "Hum" by going  urlLink here . In fact, the whole album is really good... I just really love that song a lot.   urlLink Planet Family Guy  for those who are as obsessed as me.  Radiohead gone  urlLink Yeehaw! . Definitely listen! Link from Adam Berger.   This cat is screwed!

       MONKEY BUSINESS     Maya, a chimpanzee at Jerusalem's Biblical Zoo, holds her twin babies born two days ago in Jerusalem May 24, 2004. Israeli zookeepers suspected some monkey business only after Maya, a 24-year-old chimpanzee, suddenly gave birth to twins despite an apparent lack of virile mates. The happy event at Jerusalem's Biblical Zoo caught everyone by surprise: nobody had noticed Maya was pregnant and Og and Gremlin, the only adult males among 11 chimps at the facility, were sterilized years ago, a zoo official said Tuesday.

        BREAK OUT THE CRISTAL!   Oh sweet and tender hooligans, our Patron Saint of Mope has debut on the charts at #11!   According to  Marc Spitz , who not only wrote a novel about trying to reunite the Smiths but also wrote the AMAZING COVER STORY THAT APPEARS IN  urlLink THE MAGAZINE WHICH PAYS MY BILLS , the album charted higher than Lenny Kravitz' jawn. You know why? It's because Lenny is fucking boring and repetitive and Morrissey is awesome. He's so much awesome. And according to America, he's so much more awesome than Lenny Kravitz. Hey Katie Couric, maybe you should've had the Mozzer play on the Today Show so my ears didn't have to be assulted in the morning.  Jason Roth is gonna be a daddy in a few months and rumor has it, he's naming his baby Apple. In other Jason Roth news, he sent me this email last night regarding  Adam Ant :  check out "ant muzak," which follows adam and the ants to the supermarket.  note that the night manager is actually ex-ant gary tibbs.  be sure to play the full version (the last one):   urlLink http://www.beam.tv/beamreels/beamreel.php?hHGMYfsYfs   your dandy highwayman, J   It's totally amazing and one of the guys from "The Office" is in it.

       FLOAT ON... OKAY   Hello Sarah, welcome to 10 weeks ago. So you're just sort of discovering how fucking amazing the  urlLink Modest Mouse  album is because your  urlLink new roommate  has it playing in her room whenever you stumble in from drunken nights. "Float On" is the song the Walkmen could've written if they had a pow-wow with Built to Spill. Hey Sarah,  maybe  if you play it like, 40 times in a row, you can turn back time and actually be "ahead of the curve" instead of running after it. Love, your music conscious.  So sad. OK, now i'm done talking to myself and writing myself hate mail.  So my blog seems to not work. Not sure what's happening, but i'm gonna update it anyway...just incase.  Friday, after shabbat dinner I went to the Squeezebox anniversary because i heard the Courtney Love was performing. I met up with  urlLink Jake ,  urlLink Marc  and his lovely girlfriend and my roommate, Elizabeth (she aint got a blog). The scene at Don Hills wasn't short of trannies. I was watching them enter the room as if they were the returning royalty and i began picturing what they were doing an hour early. I imagined them dusting off their wigs that they hadn't worn since the last Squeezebox about 4 or 5 years ago, squeezing themselves into their sequined gowns, pouting because their eyelash glue is clumpy. I sort of found myself happy that i didn't run around in a Tranny scene. I've got nothing agains them, I just don't know if i could keep up. I felt intimidated and scared by their posing and bodyparts here and there and everywhere. I felt like i was 18 and at Squeezebox... cept i was 24 and overwhelmed. This is why my parents keep me home on fridays.   Saturday I slept in until a pathetic 4:15pm. I woke up with a killer headache and a sense of "fuck, i know it's late. i just know it." I checked my phone and had a bunch of messages from people I was supposed to meet up with and totally flaked on. I felt like crap. The problem with sleeping in my parents house is that my bedroom slowly chokes me at night. I woke up in the morning gasping for air, and this is despite the fact that I was sleeping next to a window that was open.   My dad gave my mom the impression that our house is haunted. I tell my mom that he's full of shit, but to be honest, I sort of agree with him. I'm constantly fearing that if i turn around there will be some sort of figure standing there staring at me. I feel a presense in my room sometimes and it scares the shit out of me. If I wake up in the middle of the night I try hard to not move or open my eyes. I know this is really pathetic and silly, but I guess i'm just pathetic and silly at times.  My mom found my sparawled on the couch at 4:17pm, two minutes after i woke up. I had taken tylenol pm the night (or rather morning before since i couldnt get to bed until 6 am), and literally staggered down the stairs to the phone so i could call the people I was supposed to see that day and apologize. My mom said I looked really peaceful while sleeping. Probably cause I was drugged out of my mind and being suffocated by the ghost that lives in our house.  Saturday night I met up with Chow at the  urlLink Morning Theft  show. That band is just getting better and better and Rob is a totally great singer. I can't wait to see them perform again, and I'm gonna be sure to post the show here once i find out.  After that show we all headed over to  urlLink JennyPenny's  house for a bit of prepartying and while everyone intended to head over to  urlLink Misshapes , many didn't hop on the bus and were still at her apt at 5am when I came round to see what was going on (I woke up a 4pm that day, so it was like, 8pm for me). Misshapes was fun as always. Everyone danced around, jumped around, made out. At one point  urlLink GregTheBoyfrriend  and I were dancing and he said he couldn't make out with me cause he was sick... moments later I was dancing with him again and saw his face covered in red lipstick. The ladies can't keep their paws off the boy these days.  By the way, there's a  urlLink new misshapes gallery  up from saturday night. Will someone please  urlLink give Geordan a modeling contract  already?  urlLink Karen  and I will be happy to handle all Geo inquiries.  If somebody could please remind me what I did Sunday I'd really appreciate it.  thanks! sarah  update:  dear sarah,  on sunday you came to my house. we didnt eat m&ms because fatty had eaten them all already. fatty being me. and you the week before. we got very very very emblazened and watched... something. blue velvet. thats what it was. we got hungry, contemplated going to the west village for ice cream covered donuts, but instead got that delicious food on avenue b. then you got papped. not smeared. papped by a drummer. remember? member, member that time in that movie when you blew something out? that was awesome.  love, the other half of your brain   another update: dear sarah,   after karen's you went and saw a movie with big brother brian and you were almost not allowed in the theater for being "too high" to watch a children's movie.   love,  your burning loins.

       GO WILD IN THE CITY   Some days you just really need to listen to lots of Bow Wow Wow and Adam and the Ants. I suggest both of these bands for days when you're feeling a bit low, or a bit tired, or a bit uninspired. They're essentially the same exact bands, but with different singers. I'm not joking, they're literally the same band with different singers. So if  you're like, in the mood for a dude singing, pop in Adam. If you're in the mood for a girl singing, pop in Anabel. Good times!  So this curbing of my drinking went pretty reasonably well last night. Started off the evening with dinner at the Spotted Pig to celebrate my gorgeous boss' birthday. I had a wee bit of champagne to celebrate, followed by a glass of wine. After dinner I went over to the Slipper Room to celebrate Andy and Alex's birthday where I had 1 and a half beers -- half of one of them was poured over my head during "girls just wanna have fun" -- my hair was very sticky, but now it's got an undeniable shine to it. OK, maybe it's just shiny cause i finally washed it.  So,  urlLink Lindsay  has been living with me for like, three weeks, and it's been really fucking fun. We'll probably have a roof-top BBQ sometime very soon. Maybe even tomorrow. Maybe Sunday. Maybe next week. Alls i know is our roof is the fucking shit.  The Killers were on Carson last night and I totally dropped the ball on that one. Sorry.  By the way, I got dragged to the Strokes show the other day by Lizzy. I see things like this (and i know my rationalization is really FUCKING RETARDED, but i never claimed to be anything but really FUCKING RETARDED): Just like the Smiths vs. the Cure, Blur vs. Oasis, I see something along the lines of Interpol vs. The Strokes. So I've chosen Interpol. I appreciate the Strokes. I enjoy dancing to them. When I first heard the Strokes in 2000 or 2001 i was really excited and danced around my room while listening to "Barely Legal." But like, when i first heard Interpol (before the strokes) in 2000 or maybe earlier, i was moved. I was thrown against the wall and beaten to a pulp and happy for it. This is why i say i was dragged to the Strokes show. Anyway, it was great and Julian talked a shit load, which  pleased me a lot since he's actually funny at times -- despite being totally slurred at times. Anyway, Mazel Tov to Juliet.

       GOTHAMIST INTERVIEW DU JOUR   My ol' office chum, Greg Lindsay, is  urlLink today's Gothamist Interview . Horay for him!  I just want to make one thing clear: when I tell the cab story, he's always mentioned. It's essential that he is because otherwise there are huge gaps in the story. However, I DO usually refer to him only as "my friend Greg" rather then "Greg Lindsay" because it never occurred to me to do otherwise -- this is where the whole editing part usually stems from.  Unless I tell the story when drunk. Then it's just "i shared a cab with bowie and our thighs touched the end."

       ...SINCE I STOPPED DRINKING AGAIN   On saturday i went to  urlLink Andy"s  for a BBQ with  urlLink Lindsay . The discussion turned to the effects drusg vs. alcohol has on the brain. Before I continue, I should mention that Andy is a Scientist and goes to medical school and knows these things. Anyway, Andy has no reason to tell me the truth about drugs vs. alochol effects on the brain other then I might it interesting. We were drinking beers and he was telling me that Alchohol has the worst effect on the brain. That in a brain scan, and doctor can tell you if you're an alcoholic and that the effects are not only irreversable but also permanant (which i guess is the same thing). Alcohol has a harsher effect on the brain then pot, E, coke, and heroin -- because at least with those drugs, your brain can go back to normal after a short amount of time (the effects of E are still up in the air).   So it was with this information that i decided that i really needed to curb my lifestyle. I know i tried it in the past, but before I didn't feel like my reasons were backed with enough scientific reasoning. I stopped drinking because it was expensive and i was making a fool of myself when drunk. I stopped drinking because i wound up with inexplicable cuts and bruises. I stopped drinking because my family were threatening AA and rehab.  But then i started drinking again. The money problem was sorted with my decision to only drink when someone else is buying. The other problems were fixed by drinking a little less or being careful of who i drink with so that they could expect and maybe enjoy my drunken behavior.  Now i'm going to curb my alcohol reason for medical reasons.   I haven't had a drink since saturday, and while i'm not gonna stop drinking all together, i WILL reinstate my "drinking only on two nights a week" rule. Tomorrow will be on of those days, presumably, since i'm attending two birthday parties and djing one, but friday and sunday will be sober days.   Anyway, that's all. Goodnight. Tomorrow, i'm posting a link about the Asobie Seksu video.

        MONKEY COLLEGE!   I'm not sure there's  urlLink anything cuter :   "At the end of a long day, the student simians relax by watching the Food Network, newscasts, cartoons and even at times wildlife network Animal Planet "although it's very scary to some of them," said Judi Zazula, executive director of Helping Hands."

       FUN TIMES. HOT GIRLS.   I've been asked to participate in the  urlLink WYSIWYG Talent Show  tonight along with my roommate  urlLink Lindsay Robertson , and several other lovely ladies of the nerd. It's at PS122 and begins at 7:30.   I'm reading first cause i need to leave early so i can shoot something for CNN Headline news. So if you're not in NYC and want to be able to throw rotten food at a projected image of me, you can do that at exactly 9:15 EST by turning on your TV.

        SO MUCH AWESOME   Alright, so I've been home all day long and while not watching  urlLink Fuse  or  Before Sunrise , I've been watching "The Family Guy" Volume 1 DVD boxset. This thing is seriously the best thing a person could own. If you're trying to think of what to buy your friend for their birthday, i highly recommend this. Hours and hours of fun. You don't even need to be stoned to enjoy it!  For current "Family Guy" enthusiasts, check  urlLink this out .  Anyway, I blame  urlLink KarenPlusOne  for this.

        AWWWWW!   I know that it might be really super uncool of me to totally fucking love Gwen and Chris Martin, but I think they make an adorable couple and their baby, Apple, is gonna grow up to be a totally upstanding knockout. Throughout her pregnancy, Gwen looked picturesque and Chris was a total doting husband/father-to-be. What isn't there to admire about that? Also, Chris is just a really nice guy. He's like the type of guy you're happy to have around, but don't necessarily make plans with because you think he's doing something way more fun and would think that what you're doing is so lame, but it's actually just all in your head and he really wishes you'd call him every once in a while to make plans to go to the park or something. Gwen is sort of that pretty girl who is friends of a friend and you remember every conversation you've ever had with her and what she was wearing at the time.  I'm home sick today and have been watching loads of TV and finding out some interesting things:  One of the twins from Sweet Valley High is totally on a teeth whitening commerical.    They played a Grandaddy song on the Today Show this morning.   Honda is using a Ween song from  The Mullusk  (sp?) album and nobody's said anything? I've been like dancing around my room whenever it's on, and i refuse to believe that nobody else noticed it.   To those who felt like everyone knew about the beheadding of Berg and didn't think I needed to bring it up in  my  blog, i'd like to point out that there are people in Germany that don't know that they need to  urlLink have sex  in order to have babies.    that's all.

       FOR THOSE WHO LIKE THE COCTEAU TWINS...   Scott  urlLink Stereogum  just posted this  urlLink amazing Delays b-side  that sounds like the  urlLink Cocteau Twins  meets  Sigur Ros ... well, actually way more Cocteau Twins then anything else. Really ambiant and stunning with falsetto vocals. Just pretty.  Oh, and  wanna party on May 20? ? Alex Pappademas and Andy Greenwald from SPIN Magazine are having a birthday party on May 20 at the  urlLink Slipper Room . I'm gonna be DJing it for a bit and have been told that I could invite people. Consider this the invite.  If you wanna know what they want for their birthdays here are some ideas:  Andy likes the following stuff: emo, clever comic books, video games, and 'shrooms. Alex likes the following stuff: digital cameras, the fall, and lsd.   you dont have to buy them gifts. just show up. dance. drink. be hedonistic. watch people you read the words of drink more than you and never pass out.  good times.

        SING ME TO SLEEP    urlLink Laura  posted something very important last week: "The Killers = obnoxiously pretty"  More photos of how  urlLink pretty they are .  I know I hype every band fronted by a pretty face (or at least most of them) who sound like they spend all day listening to the Smiths and Joy Division, but like, when  urlLink the Killers  album becomes available you're all gonna be singing along. Until then, you can buy an EP of theirs on iTunes for "Somebody Told Me" -- which I promise will make your ass move.  I repeat, this is not a Killers fansite. I just like the band a lot and want to have 10,000 of their babies.  This morning when I went to the "Cold Pizza" taping i brought the new issue of  urlLink Star Magazine  with the Olsen twins on the cover and said "i want mary-kate's makeup please." Mission accomplished! I also dropped the obvs bomb since I knew that  urlLink Uncle Grambo  was watching.  Unbelievably,  urlLink Muse 's  Absolution  is on the soundscan chart this week... at #196, which blows my mind. I honestly didn't think anyone else listened to them other than me and the people who sit 10 feet from me and have to listen to me blasting "Apocalypse Please" all day long.   OK, this weekend's buzz:  The Olsen Twins are on SNL with R.Kelly. Fantastic booking.   urlLink Misshapes  is always fun on saturday night.   Nate the ex-roommate's band,  urlLink Modern , is performing at Luna lounge sunday. They sound like Sunny Day Real Estate meets Radiohead and Nate is a total hottie.  And tonight, Colder is playing at Rothko (rivington and suffolk on the lower east side). I can't find the link to their site, but they sound like early new order mixed with joy division and  urlLink Alex Chow  blew a load when he heard them saying they sounded like "every band i ever liked from the 80s rolled into one." let's hope their live show is hot.

       DOUBLE YOU TEE EFF?!   Thank you to  urlLink Grambo  and  urlLink Best Week Evs  for  urlLink this photo  that i wont even post cause it's really awful. Hint: it's c.love.  Anyway, got a haircut (finally) at  urlLink Whistle . I'd been told to go there by a shit load of people and finally  urlLink Karen  gave me the number and the name of the dude she goes to. I know that Interpol goes there, and i'll do anything they do cause they're the best band and I want to be them and have 10,000 of their babies. I ended up getting only a trim cause my hair stylist liked my long hair a lot. I hadn't cut my hair since last july and when he was snipping away i suggested he just hack it off and give me a mohawk. He said he'd do it next time. I'm sick of my hair.   After the hair cut I started walking home and ran into  urlLink Lindsayism  and  urlLink TMFTML  (whom i sort of refuse to call by his real name) outside of the Magician on Rivington. We had a drink and then popped into Rothko for  urlLink Audrey's  party. $2 PBR! Hot damn! Not that it matters -- I made a new rule that I will only drink when others are buying. Thankfully,  urlLink Brian  was my sugar daddy for the night.   After listening to the always amazing Rob Sheffield and Dennis Cahlo DJ, I headed over to the Hole with Brian and Sarah Wilson to see Sera DJ. I only stayed for about a half hour tho cause that played has cooties. Brian was nice enough to walk me home and I didn't even have to put out! Score!  Anyway, that was a boring post. Sorry. I've got nothing interesting happening... oh... I did accidently bust in on Lindsay the roommate last night and she had not top on. She's officially a member of apartment 3A.   Does anyone watch Cold Pizza on ESPN? I'm gonna be on tomorrow morning at 8am. Fun times. I'm gonna try to drop some Whatevs vernac.   "the answer to that is bovs, dude."

       DEAR GOD... THE DECAPITATION VIDEO... DO NOT WATCH   What's happened to Iraqi prisoners in the hands of some American soldiers is so beyond shameful and disgusting and inhumane. I'm so sad to be not only an American but also a human. It's a two sided game apparently, with Al Qaida seeking revenge.  I just learned of (a) decapitation(s) that occured and have been STRONGLY advised to not watch the video. My sources tell me that the video is of "Al Qaida making this guy give his personal information into a camera... then thwack. no more head."  You will learn more about this from  urlLink reading this . Link from  urlLink  Drudge Report .  In case you're masochistic or you're from a news organization and need to watch the video,  urlLink go here but DO NOT WATCH IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO . Please listen to me. YOU CAN'T WATCH THE VIDEO unless you must for a very important reason and not just out curiosity.    I know this site is usually about the most retarded stuff in the world and I'm usually being very silly about things, but this time I am begging you to not watch the video UNLESS YOU MUST. I'm not putting this up and saying "don't watch" in hopes that you do actually eat it and taste from the apple of knowledge. I'm putting this up incase you happen to read my blog and also happen to work at some sort of new organization of some sort. If you dont believe me about not watching this...  Some comments people I know have said about it: "Dear God that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life   I don't even know what to say. I don't care, no liberal can defend this or say shit about it. That is one fucked up culture."   "the video is absolutley horrendous. I absolutley recommend not watching it."   "this cannot be reiterated enough. do not watch that."  "if i had known it would've been that bad i would've heeded the warning label."

        MY WEEKEND WAS PRETTY TYPICAL, HOW WAS YOURS?   It's about fucking time i got my shit together and posted about my weekend! Started shit off on friday at the Lewitinn Residence in Tenafly where I rocked out with the G to the O to the D. My mom just got surgery and she refuses to take her oxycodone after I told her that it's equivalent to heroin and she should be careful. Now, I realize that it was so refuckingtarded of me to say that since she's been moaning in pain for days. Man, and she could've been in such a cool rehab center with all those famous people! I'm joking of course. I just want her to get better so she can get back in the kitchen where women belong.  OK, so Saturday was so much awesome. I DJed my first ever wedding -- which was totally the best thing I've ever done. Played a bit of the 50s stuff and jazz for the older folks, duran duran and madonna for the younger kids, but easily the most incredible moment -- that was thankfully captured on tape by Raphael the Boyfriend -- was when, my third song in, I dropped the Yeah Yeah Yeah's "Maps" bomb and got to watch about 20 couples stop dancing and turn to me with a look of "holy shit, what the fuck do we do." and then watch 10 of those couples, all older, decide to ballroom dance to it. It was the most exciting experience of my life. I can't wait to DJ my next wedding... no idea when that'll be. Anyway, many thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Hildenberger for inviting me to DJ their wedding! Mazel Tov!  By the way, Raphael is gonna digitize the video for me so I can post it on my blog. I can't fucking wait.  After the wedding I headed over to  urlLink Misshapes  to participate in the first ever TARTS OF PLEASURE VS. DEATH & DESTRUCTION DJ BATTLE! Despite the photo ( urlLink click her for larger image ), I didn't actually get a black eye since DJ's Death & Destruction are total fucking pussies and I kicked their asses twice with the help of my trusty dancer  urlLink KarenPlusOne .  urlLink Uncle Grambo  will be sad to hear that I didn't repeat  urlLink this buzz  cause i was wearing an expensive dress. But I guess karma is a bitch since Alex Chow, i mean DJ Death (or Destruction?) accidently spilled half of his really sweet and sticky drink on my head when my friend Ben dipped me while dancing. It was hilarious and my hair was totally "Something About Mary" in the morning... minus the spunk.  The word in the girls room was:  girl one: i think the girls one. *sniff* girl two: thanks, hey do you want some? I think they won too. *sniff* girl three: yeah, thank you. i think the boys are pussies. *sniff*  I guess they started showing Michael Caine movies in the bathroom.  Anyway, I managed to make out with more boys then a girl should. I guess those are the perks of being the DJ.   Sunday was Mothers Day and it took an army of phone calls to wake me up. Clinton Street Bakery finally got me out of bed so I could have their FUCKING AMZING Huevos Rancheros. People, if you haven't tried these yet and you live in nyc, you must hop in a cab on saturday morning and get this IMMEDIATELY. After brunch I went to the UWS to go DVD shopping with my homobro for my mom and then we went back to Tenafly so I could hear my mom complain about not buying her flowers.  Yesterday I went to check out the Cardigans at Bowery and had the delightful pleasure of not only seeing  urlLink Johnathan Rice  perform, but also witness  urlLink Lindsayism's  first J.Rice show. She fucking loved him, and I fucking loved him. Then Aqualung played and I was floored. Lindsay left and Johnathan plied me with more JesusJuice then Michael Jackson would advise is appropriate. He nearly had to hold me up during the Cardigan's slightly disappointing set of new songs. My friend Steve was nice enough to drive me home where I discovered that when you puke red wine, it come out looking really fucking cool in your toilet. Purple is my favorite color. What a pleasure!  Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that Karen made me a fantastic mix cd called: The KarenPlusOne Guide to Liking Zeppelin Even If You're a PostPunk-Phile who Wants To Give Morrissey a Hand Job.  Bummed she left out "Immigrant Song" but I totally loved it none-the-less. She made it for me after I revealed to her, that much like Brandon Flowers of the Killers, the only music that I really recognized pre-1978 were the Beatles and RollingStones. I'm stupid, i know, so sue me.  And Greg the Boyfriend shared this lovely tidbit with me after I revealed to him that he's one of the best kissers    in the history of kissers: "I kissed some woman that I grabbed on the street and made dance with me in the rain.  after we danced, I picked her up honeymoon style and sat her on a newspaper stand and kissed her, to which she screamed "you just Frenched me!"  then I smiled, got in a cab and went away.  She was smiling when I looked back."  Some links:    urlLink Reading Lineup    urlLink Be this guy's girlfriend . From Gabrielle.

        TA DA!   OK, this is my last post of the day -- or at least for the next few hours.  For what it's worth, everything I learned about modern-boys I learned from  urlLink Andy dePunk . Many months ago I flirted with him, he laid down the "how to flirt properly with boys" law, and it's worked out really fucking well for the most part. At first when I read his email i was like "is he serious?" and asked  urlLink Brian  "Is he for real? This is how you guys are?" When he confirmed Andy's revelation I promptly deleted the phone numbers of boys I was persuing, or rather, hoping to be persued by. This story could go on, but then it'd venture on really personal territory and while I feel alright talking about my drinking and narcotic habits and making outs and interests in burying my face in the underaged and freckled  urlLink breasts of Lindsay Lohan , I strangely don't feel comfortable talking about my actual love life. I never thought there'd be a day when I'd want to have at least one secret.  Anyway, now you too can  urlLink learn what I learned  from Andy.  Maybe you'll have a  urlLink Mermaid Baby . OK, that's not funny. I'm not laughing. I'm just informing you guys that a baby was born and this baby resembles a mermaid. This baby is adorable.  I'm always teased about the time I was on MTV2's "22 Greatest Bands" proclaiming my total love for Linkin Park. Well, fuck y'all. Yesterday I got to interview Chester Bennington (the white dude who sings and looks emo). Our interview was supposed to be 10 minutes but we started geeking out on Placebo together and it lasted an hour.  I also spoke to Wayne from the Flaming Lips for a half hour today about life in a bubble. He was quite nice and friendly andwe talked about Radiohead. I like it when rock stars holla to their significant others while i'm on the phone with them. I feel like they're letting me in on something really personal in their life, when in reality, they're like "yo, what was the name of that festival?"   urlLink Lindsayism , my new roommate who doesn't seem to mind living with me yet, noted that  urlLink MKOlsen  is rocking the same eye makeup that I used to rock and have recently ressurected. My brother said that MKO and I both look alike cause we look like monkeys. Between her, the singer of  urlLink the killers , and Brian from Placebo [see below], i really dont mind looking like a girl. Certainly not an incredibly skinny and wealthy monkey.  Now, for those of you who plan on seeing "A New York Minute" this weekend, and are wondering "Sarah, you're so drunk, have you forgotten to post a review of the movie?" My answer is yes. I am so drunk that i've forgotten. But actually, I'm also not sure this movie is for everyone. It's not like "Freaky Friday" where the story line is really thick and thoughtful, but it's also not like "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen" where it's totally lacking any sense. It's a big budgeted Olsen movie that is full of sexual ennuendo, really hot twins, loads of b-list cameos, and silly girlie playfulness. It's not the best movie of all time. It's not the worst. It's a drinking film. So here is the:   UNOFFICIAL NEW YORK MINUTE DRINKING GAME   1 SHOT: Everytime it's suggested that Jane (Ashley Olsen) is naked. 1 SHOT: For every sexual ennuendo. 1 SHOT: For every b-list celebrity cameo 1 SHOT: For every b-list reoccuring character  1 SHOT: For every time the name SIMPLE PLAN is uttered -1 SHOT: For every time you want to do something really inappropriate to either twin.  You'll leave the movie totally sober with that last one up there. Sorry dudes. It's official. You want to bang 17 year old twins. I mean, who doesnt?!

       THE MORNING AFTER   Before heading over to  urlLink MISSHAPES  to see the most over-rated DJ battle of the century, head over to the Knitting Factory to witness the debut of The Morning After. In case any of you were at the Darkness show at Irving plaza a few months ago when Justin Hawkins was outshined by a boy on someone's shoulders doing his best Mick Jagger... it was the singer of the Morning After. Go see him in action. Center of Attention. I urge you. If I weren't at a wedding during their show, i'd be up front and center throwing my granny-panties in his face.

       ONE DAY...   I'll write about the time I shared a cab with David Bowie when i was 19 years old. Until then, here's a photo of me with David Bowie... only, it's not me.     I once met Brian Molko from Placebo the day before doing a phoner interview. The conversation went like this:  Me: I'm interviewing you tomorrow. Brian: It's nice to be able to put a face to the voice on the other end of the phone. Sarah Wilson: You can put YOUR face to the voice!  Fast foward a few months. The scene: Placebo's Webster Hall After party:   Me: So anyway I was like [blah blah blah]. Scott from Astralwerks: Can we switch places. I keep on looking at Brian who is standing behind you and getting freaked out that you're multiplying.

       THE LAST OF THE FAMOUS INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOYS   I just got home from the Morrissey show at the Apollo and the show tonight wasn't as good as Tuesdays. Perhaps it had to do with my seating (i was up on balcony tonight ... was on the floor on tuesday), or maybe I was a bit used to the set... but I really, really, really wish he performed more songs from his older albums. I would've liked to have heard "Suedehead" or "Last of the Famous..." or "Have a Go" or "Boxer"... Instead he played a lot of new songs. I like the new album, but it's not really what I payed an arm and a leg to hear -- especially since i dont own it yet! "Irish Blood..." was a standout track of the new songs, and I thought he did an amazing job with it. Also, I am all for the Mozzer taking off his shirt.   During the encore of "There is a Light that Never Goes Out" i ran into a girl named Lisa that I used to go to elementry, middle and high school with... Amazingly, this was the second time I've run into her in the past two days -- yesterday she was at the Olsen Twins screening -- and I hadn't seen her since 1998. It's such a small world that she was sitting in the seat that i abandoned my jacket and back in.   After the show, Vicki went outside for a smoke and then met up with a couple of her friends and a couple of mine and the whole of us went in for the Mozzer after party which was sadly missing the mozzer. Awesomely, Dino, from Morrissey's band introduced himself to me when he saw me look in his direction and I also got to meet Boz. Boz plays guitar for Moz.   Holy shit. There's a Franz Ferdinand commerical on Comedy Central right now. So sexy. I'm happy that my DJ group's name is in honor of that band since they're so fucking wonderful and deserve to have everything in honor of them!  Anyway, Thank you Morrissey for bringing me up to the Apollo theater for the first time in my life. I'm totally going back for amature night!  Also,  urlLink Miss ModernAge  finally  urlLink slept with me .

       A NEW YORK MINUTE   Last night while I was in the theater by Times Square (and mtv, btw) watching the new Olsen Twins movie, I received a voice mail from my friend Gideon who was like "Sarah, the Olsen twins are taping TRL today. Call me back if you want to go." I got that voice mail this afternoon. God laughs at me sometimes.   Anyway, I raced back to the Lower East Side so i could DJ Nora's party at Piano. Had a really great time and got to see a bunch of good friends, including my brother, whom i hadn't seen in ages.  Tonight I was gonna go home to watch the finale of Friends but then Vicki told me that she had an extra ticket for Morrissey and suddenly it's like "what the fuck is a chandler?" I look so grungy and grody for the show tonight... c'est la vie. Harlem is mine and it owes me champagne.  Anyway... I'm gonna be DJing at  urlLink Misshapes  on Saturday but things are gonna be a bit different... read on:     Ultragrrrl:   i just booked all of us    Ultragrrrl:   OK. the first ever Tarts of Pleasure Vs. Death & Destruction at Misshapes. Saturday night at 1am.   deadelevators:   haha!

        OH, COOL, THEY PLAYED CREEP   Alright, so I've been back from Coachella for more then 24 hours and I was surprisingly back to normal yesterday morning when I woke up in my own bed, clean and no longer smelling of two days worth of sweat, chlorine, and dirt. I'm like a rubber band I guess.  Coachella was hot, sweaty, and fun. Really fucking fun and if you ever get a chance to go next year, i strongly urge it. I ended up staying in a bungalo about 5 miles from the coachella site with about 30 people who slept everywhere. I shared a bed with  urlLink GiuliaDoll  and Sarah Wilson, and on our floor was the ever gorgeous Kimberly Taylor-Bennet. In the bed next door was  urlLink JasonProductshop , who was in bed with a few people, then there was Halified, Adam Mandel,  urlLink Jordan and his family , and like, ten others. I shit you not. We BBQ'ed, swam in the pool, soaked in the jacuzzi, read up on Mary Kate and Ashely, ate, cooked... yeah, it was a good time had by all!  By the way, if you ever need to hitch a ride back home, look for a pick up truck with a Jesus sticker. These lovely Jesus people picked me, kim, jordan and jason up on saturday night, drove us all around, and then gave us TUIT stickers after telling us "God Bless You." Now i sort of love Jesus. Thank you Baby Jesus! Ps. Jordan's shirt is kinda gay.  The highlights of Coachella for me:   The Pixies  - who sounded like they must've about 10+ years ago.  Radiohead  - everytime i see radiohead, my former total retarded obsession, i am like "eh, i've seen them a dozen times, i'm like, not losing my head over seeing them again." and then they take to the stage and i have mild epileptic seizures and dance in ways you'd be embarassed about. Then they played creep and i was in need of a new pair of underwear. Thom held that last note for like, 30 minutes.  Muse  - they were about 20 times better at coachella then at the bowery ballroom show. I did notice that for one song there might've been prerecorded backing vocals, but that was for ONE single song, and I can handle that. Plus, at the SPIN party Matt told me that they're gonna tour the states a bit more, including CureFest with the Cure, Interpol, the Rapture, and Mogwai. Right, so you know when I say something gross and get a million complaints from readers in my comment box? Well, fuck you cause that news made me so excited that puke tried to come out of my nose.   The Flaming Lips  - So totally incredible. I've never seen them before so i was insanely blown away and didn't want them to ever end. Sadly, they played only 4 songs, but all good ones. Um... Wayne came out into the audience in a fucking gigantic bubble. A GIGANTIC BUBBLE. Fuck you. That's amazing.  The Killers  -  it was sweltering in the tent they played in, but i sweated to the oldies and threw my hands in the air when the full on gospel choir came out. As Brandon Flowers promised me a few weeks ago, they were better then the one that came out at SXSW.   The Cure  was a bit on the not-so-amazing side. They played lots of really great songs, but the volume was too low for their set and the mix was just really awful. These are things they couldn't help, plus following the Flaming Lips' show was going to be difficult no matter what.  Last night i went to see Morrissey in Harlem and i dont think I've ever had a reaction to a show like I did. It was full of superfandom for me. I was shaking and laughing very hysterically in a frightening way. Poor Rob Sheffield. He stood next to me and didn't inch away once when I grabbed his arm and started being sort of like a maniac. Also, I yelled out to Morrissey "I LOVE YOU" and he said "HOW MUCH?" and i couldnt move. I could only stand there laughing like "ahahahahahahhahahahahaha" breathe "ahahahhahahahahhahahahahha" breathe "ahhahhahahahahahhhhaha." I dont even know what song he played after that cause i was like, on cloud nine for a bit.  OK, i'm gonna go see "A New York Minute" now. Thank you Baby Dave Itzkoff!

       HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS   My friend Sean McGrath died yesterday. Apart from being an all around wonderful person, you might have heard of his name because he was the former bassist of Saves the Day and also played in The Alps.   He'd been battling cancer for a couple of years. This is so sad. I really thought he'd pull through. I'm so sad.   Rest in Peace sweet boy.

       SARAH'S SO BORING EVER SINCE SHE STOPPED BLOGGING   Whoa, thanks a lot for everyone's support in all this. Basically, the official statement is this:  I felt like this blog was fucking with my political aspirations. Seriously, who can run for president if people think they have a drinking problem, or a drug problem, or are mabye questionable private lives? I'm worried that in 11 years when I'm 35, pregnant with my second child, married to the singer of the Killers, and on the campaign trail, someone's gonna bust out something like: "On September 10, 2003, you said "I feel like last night didnt happen to me. It was such a blur and a whirlwind and a confusion of senses that it was like something out of a really trippy movie out of england about the rave drug culture or something. only, minus the dancing." Now don't you think you should've been mourning the near-2 year anniversary of September 11. You are a bad canidate!" And the whole thing would be down the tubes. Tragic! I'd make a good president. Not sure which party I'd be on yet, but whatever party it is better have an awesome DJ!   But I was also really touched by everyone who posted such nice things on the comments section and who emailed me with their concerns (not to mention called me, my roommates, and friends -- many of whom offered to be my publicist). I'm fine. My health is fine. My job is fine. I really wanted to lose readers (ie: the people who read this blog, post on it, and say they don't like me, yet waste their time with my drivel). Overall, I was just totally touched by how sweet the people who read this little thing are. My Goodness!  So this blog will return eventually. Hopefully nobody will care about it when it does (not to assume that people care about it now... but you get the idea), and I can continue to blog without someone making accusations and threats (word). I'll still be drunk. I'll still be making out with boys. I'll still be going out 39 times a week to see bands and tell you about them. But until then read SPIN. It's a good magazine!  Suddenly I feel a bit like Jay-Z. 99 Problems but the blog aint one.

        HERE ARE THE YOUNG MODERNS   Back on New Years Eve 98/99 I introduced myself to a boy who later became one of my very close friends. He was wearing a really cool marching band jacket and make up and looked like Adam Ant at his peak. I thought to myself that I wanted to be this person if i was actually a boy (something I really wish i was -- i'd make a great guy, especially with my knowledge of women). So we chatted a bit and he told me he was in a band in Chicago. I pretty much was like, yeah, whatever, everyone's in a band. I didn't think much about it. He told me his band was called  urlLink Kill Hannah , and I noted to myself to at least check out a band fronted by such a cute boy. Shallow? Yeah. I was 18. Sue me.  A few months later I somehow befriended this other boy named  urlLink Adriel  (whom also later became one of my very close friends) on the nerd who was from Chicago. I was totally excited because after searching endlessly for Kill Hannah tracks I had come up empty handed and finally I found someone who could send me songs. So he sent me a tape of a bunch of songs from KH eps. I popped it into my car's tape deck (I was commuting from NJ to my internship at  urlLink spin.com  at the time) and was totally estatic. It was so much awesome. Dreamy, sexy, New Order-ish, MBV-ish... I was in love! I listened to that tape over and over again until it was finally eaten up by the tape deck.  I remember once driving around Tenafly to a friends house blasting a song, feeling like a total iconoclast in comparision to the kids i went to school with who were all still getting stoned to DMB, the Dead, and Phish. Despite their illadvised taste in music, I thought they were always so much cooler than me, and wished that maybe, just maybe, one of them would hear the cool songs blasting out of my car and be like "Sarah, that's some cool stuff. What is it?" It never happened. Little did i realize that i was a huge dork for blasting the songs really loud out of my Nissan Stanza.   Anyway, the point of this is this: Today I got a package in the mail from Mat Devine, the singer of Kill Hannah. He wrote: "Here are a couple copies of the disc we just pressed -- please, you have to let the cassette go... it's a dead medium." Enclosed were two copies of  The Curse of Kill Hannah 1996-1998 . A collection of the songs from their early EPs that made me fall head over heels in love with them in the first place. Once again I'm sat here at my desk, blasting "Chloroform," hoping that at least one cool kid people i work with will stop by my desk and say "hey, that sounds pretty cool. what is it?"  Anwyay, the track listing for anyone else who might be a fan of Kill Hannah:  1. Hummingbirds the Size of Bullets 2. Kill Hannah 3. He Believes in Time Machiens 4. The Trains are so Loud 5. No One Dreams Anyway (demo) 6. Hummingbirds the Size of Bullets (remix) 7. Sleeping Like Electric Eels 8. Dazzle These Nights Dead 9. Held on By Wires 10. Agent Orange Skies 11. Stunt Pilots 12. Love Sick 13. Chloroform (Slow Reaction)

       NEWSFLASH!   For every boy who admits that boys are retarded -- there's a girl out there who will do the same and admit that girls are fucking retarded sometimes.  We all say we want Lloyd Dobbler... when in reality we want to  save   urlLink Steff . It's total and utter bullshit.  I'm home sick today. My body is slowly deciding to not work. It's been protesting with me for the past week and I finally lost the war. Blows.

                          HE'S NOT JESUS CHRIST BUT HE'S GOT THE SAME INITIALS   I've been really busy these past few days, save for the last night where I just sat in a daze in front of the TV for about 4 hours watching episode after episode of season 3 of "The Family Guy" with the  urlLink new   urlLink roommates  (we try to take a night off from boozing and slutting it up every once in a while to recharge... i'm joking of course, sort of). It was an exhausting weekend.  Before I go into talking about my weekend... about the photo: "A man was fined nearly 300 dollars for drunk driving a donkey cart in a small South African town and then telling police he was unconcerned 'because the animals knew the way home.'(AFP/POOL/File) " What an ass!  Last week I mentioned something about my parent's house being haunted. I've got no doubt in my mind that it is. After dinner on friday night I went to use the powder room for things that one does there -- and the light turned off when i was in a very compromising position. Thinking that the lights went off in the rest of the house as well, I grabbed a magazine to cover my junk from the world and ran to the door. It was stuck and i couldnt get it open. I panicked and yelled for my mom like the little bitch i am. I got it opened and to my disbelief, the rest of the house had light. Everything had light, but the bathroom i was in. I touched the light switch and it turned right back on. This ghost hasn't been around the whole time, and if it has, it hasn't been really interested in hanging out with us. But lately it's been racing across the room while my mom is on the phone, making my blind dog bark at the air, and has one hell of a sense of humor, shutting my lights off as I sit on the can. My aunt thinks it's a friendly ghost. You can buy shit from my parents' ghostly  urlLink garage sale  this weekend.  Saturday I went out with my mom, aunt, and my cousins who are about 11 and 16. My little cousins are so fucking awesome... i'm stoked to be related to them. My cousin Renee is a gorgeous little girl who looks like a supermodel mixed with an Olsen Twin. She's 11 and short for her age, but stylish as hell. She was wearing this pin striped pair of pants, black chuck taylors, a layered top, and a blazer. I was like "Whoa, you look like you're in the Strokes!" her older brother, Eric (16), said "yeah, that's the look she's going for."   We went to H&M and then I took Eric to Search & Destroy -- which he totally dug, but didnt get anything, and then we went to Urban Outfitters (dont front like you dont go there too... I know you do).   The Streets' "Fit But You Know It" is totally fucking Blur's "Parklife." How fucking fun!   Anyway, Saturday night I made my way to  urlLink Misshapes  hear  urlLink Audrey  DJ amazingly, and to dance with Lizzy,  urlLink Niki ,  urlLink Marc , and  urlLink Greg &Raphael. Check out  urlLink Me and the Boyfriends .   urlLink Andy  found himself cornered by me so I could ask him details about the logistics of beheading a person. This sent Greg packing and made me thirsty for more knowledge. The best thing about having a friend like Andy, other then him being awesome, is that he's got this vast knowledge about science and medicine and can explain things to me in the most laymen of terms. He's like the indie rock Stephen Hawkins for retards like myself who like to ... uh... lay-men.  It's weird. A few months ago I would get quickly exhausted from partying. I found myself crawling back home at midnight the latest to find my bed and fall asleep. I guess with the weather being better I'm able to find myself crawling home at after 4am these days... which I did on saturday night with Andy,  urlLink Brian , and a few of their friends. We didn't go home as much as we went to the new club on Delancey called The Delancey. We tried to get in cause we heard there was an open bar, and found ourselves out of luck with a doorman wearing ill-advised leather pants. I never saw this dude's face cause he was like, 39 feet tall. So Andy and his lady friends walked me home as the sun was rising.  Sunday night I went to the  urlLink Trash  party so i could DJ for the party kids. I really love DJing... it's like the most fun a person could have sometimes. I think I got really drunk tho, cause I remember straight lines were a joke, and I remember having a conversation with someone and having to keep my eyes closed (which hopefully made me look a bit pensive) so they wouldn't cross and give me a headache. I've been to Don Hills twice in the past month for the first time in ages, and both times, there were dancing half-naked people. Oy Vey. My parent's at least could breathe a sigh of relief that I wasn't one of those dancing-half-naked people. Not that there's anything wrong with it...   When I was sober during the night I got to see Jess' new band called Americana and was fully impressed. There's something there for sure. A mix of Smiths and a bit of Emo... it was right up my alley. Jess has the looks and charm that a frontman needs and I'm gonna keep a steady eye on these guys.  Monday it started pouring outside. I had invited some friends over a few days earlier promising a  BBQ with lots of yummy food, but suddenly it didn't look like it was gonna happen. So me and the girls decided to cut our losses, tell people not to come over when they called to see if it was still on, and stick all the food in our fridge save for a few beers and some food that we were gonna cook up for ourselves. Needless to say, everyone figured that rain couldn't hold 3A down and showed up. We found an indoor grill and cooked up almost all the food we bought. Sorry to anyone i told to not come. We're gonna have a .. um.. rain date. I manned the grill, by the way, and made some killer chicken.  Yesterday morning my brain was fucked. I had spent the past three days partying and was really super tired. I found myself in Long Island interviewing a former member of a boyband who shall remain nameless (there's a clue to his itentity in the title of this blog posting) in his hotel room, and then later in his bus. The Singer (who will be called TS from here on out) and I got off on the wrong foot, arguing about race car drivers. He told me that some drivers could make up to $200 Million A YEAR. Yeah, you read that number right. So my thought was "I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck." This statement launched TS into a total ghetto accent that was so over the top, it was a parody of itself:  Me: "I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck." TS: "When it's what you know, you do it."  Me: "Well, fine, but it seems unnecessary to keep it up if you're bringing home a check like that. All you need is one check and you're set for life." TS: "They're just doing what they know. They can't help it. It's what they know." Me: "Well, they should get to know something else. Something less life-threatening." TS: (getting a bit hostile) "What's they supposed to do? Be an accountant?" Me: (getting annoyed) "No, that's the point! They don't need a job. They can chill out. Hang out with their family. Go traveling." TS: "Not when racing is all you know. You gonna tell a pilot to get a different job when all they know is flying?" Me: "If I knew a pilot who brought home a $200 Million paycheck for one year of work, yes, I would tell him that."  TS: "Well, it's all they know."  According to the former member of a popular boyband that is possibly no longer together but features a member who went out with a popstar who is now looking like she had too many days snorting oxycontin, race car drivers aren't very faceted.

        I’M BEGINNING TO QUESTION YOUR COMMITMENT TO SPARKLE MOTION   If you’ve been reading this blog for any amount of time longer than a week (or maybe even just a week), it’d come as no surprise that I’m a very big fan of the movie   Donnie Darko  .  I’ve seen the movie about 30 times and even bought a DVD player largely so I could watch the movie at home with commentary and deleted scenes because I wanted to understand the movie better. Just like a boy who doesn’t really like to talk – you become obsessed. What are they hiding? What can you unlock? What about the bigger picture of this are you missing? It’s like  Jordan Catalano  syndrome, only I feel like  Donnie Darko  is deeper that my high school crush. And yes, you’ve just entered another  Donnie Darko  related post. A very long one at that.  One of the things that really drew me the most into Monde Donnie Darko was the accompanying music:  Echo and the Bunnymen ’s “The Killing Moon,”  Tears for Fears ’ “Head Over Heels,”  Joy Division ’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” Duran Duran ’s “Notorious,”  The Church ’s “Under the Milky Way,” and  Gary Jules ’ version of the  Tears for Fears  song “Mad World,” to name a few.  For the longest time I just thought that these songs were merely put in there to put a time context to the movie and because they were really fucking cool songs. In retrospect, I realize that these songs were actually plot devices serving as clues to what’s going on in the movie and to maybe help the viewer get a better sense of what everything' means. Until  urlLink Scott  sent me a link to a  urlLink Salon  article  urlLink  about the movie  I still hadn’t figured things out. So before reading on, I suggest you go to that article.  I warn you, I will be super insane about this, so you might not follow because I’m not sure my thoughts are totally flushed out to the point of making sense.   [EDIT: I saw the directors cut last night (I unfortunately missed the first 4 minutes, which meant that I missed one of my favorite scenes,  which  also means I missed the fact that they changed the song they used in the opening scene. It was no longer "The Killing Moon" by Echo and the Bunnymen. Now it's INXS' "Never Tear Us Apart" and apparently the song worked really nicely. I guess I'll go see it again tomorrow so I can see this for myself. Anyway, there are some added comments to this post that I thought about since last night -- and since seeing the directors cut, so i'm putting those notes in red, just like this.]     Echo and the Bunnymen – “The Killing Moon”   The movie, I found, nearly appears to be written almost as if the screenwriter had been given an assignment to create a movie based on a song, and that song is “The Killing Moon” by Echo and the Bunnymen. Must I point out the fact that Donnie Darko spends the whole movie following around and listening to the advice of a dude in a bunny costume? (BTW – apparently NIN’s “Hurt” inspired the movie  Fight Club .)   “Under blue moon I saw you”  begins the song. The blue moon represents a rare moment, much like the rare moment when something happens in the universe that causes there to be two universes. A freaky occurrence in space, the world or universe will collapse and destroy itself. Nature killing itself.   “Up in your arms too late to beg you or cancel it though I know it must be the killing time, unwillingly mine”  - Donnie, for the first time (a rare moment a la a blue moon), experiences love but also needs to face the fact that he must destroy and kill everything to save everything. It’s something he doesn’t want to do but needs too, nearly against his will.   ”Fate, up against your will. Through the thick and thin, he will wait until you give yourself to him.”  -- OK, the first part of this line can be interpreted as how Donnie must face his fate as the inevitable and unlikely superhero – a fate nearly all super heroes feel sort of unhappy with. The second part of that line can be used with two reasons: 1. Donnie’s girlfriend Gretchen most likely gives her virginity to Donnie (or at least takes his) and he needs to have that in his life to feel complete and then feel alright and not alone about destroying the parallel universe so he can save the real  one, and 2. Donnie is giving himself to God by following through with what fate had left him with.    ”In starlit nights I saw you. So cruelly you kissed me. Your lips a magic world, your sky all hung with jewels. The killing moon, will come too soon.”  -- What kisses Donnie cruelly under starlit night is the kiss of death for his love, Gretchen. The lips forcing him into a magic, parallel world. The hung part is obviously referencing his ginormous cock.   ”La la la la la...”  -- the nonchalantness Donnie eventually feels about the whole thing when he’s sat in his bed laughing. OK, I’m stretching with that one.   [EDIT: This song doesn't open the film anymore. Instead it's what you hear just after Donnie and Gretchen have sex for the first time. It works pretty well in that scene as well since it's got the whole concept of there being a killing moon and Donnie kills Frank shortly after while they're in the twilight. It also pushes the "fate up against your will" concept of how Donnie is just doing what fate has called for him to do -- which is DESTROY THE TANGENT UNIVERSE]     Joy Division – “Love Will Tear Us Apart”   OK, whatever Donnie is feeling in this movie can be summed up best by this song. His love for Gretchen, his short, yet undying love for her, causes him to destroy everything. It tears them apart because she follows him to the cellar door and gets killed by Frank. It tears them apart because when Donnie is given a second chance to live and repeat everything that went wrong for a chance to be in love with Gretchen again – or maybe not even repeat for definite but face the  chance  of repeating the fate that leads to Gretchen’s death, he chooses to off himself so she might live. At least he got to live a life for a short time when he was in love and knew that someone loved him back. He’d rather die than not feel that again. His love for her, tears them apart. Unlike “The Killing Moon,” it’s about “Love Will Tear Us Apart”’s feeling, rather than the lyrics.     Duran Duran – “Notorious”   Not my favorite Duran Duran song, but I’m assuming the reason it was used (if the director/music supervisior was as meticulous about the song selection as I’m making them out to be) was because of this line:   ”No.. no.. notorious! I.. can't read about it, burns the skin from your eyes,  I'll do fine without it, here's one you don't compromise. Lies come hard to disguise, let me to fight it out, not wild about it. Lay your seedy judgements, who says they're part of our lives?”  -- Patrick Swayze’s character , Jim Cunningham, comes to Donnie’s town as a sort of holier than thou self help master whom Donnie calls out for being a fraud and the anti-Christ. Turns out Donnie was right. Cunningham was busy with a child pornography ring when he wasn’t busy trying to convince everyone that he was the second coming. This is discovered when Donnie burns down his house and the fire department finds a secret room filled with the sicko porno tapes. Pretty seedy for such a judgmental person. He was no longer able to disguise his lies, despite Kitty “God is Awesome” Farmer’s attempt to prove his innocence. It’s no mistake that this was played during Sparkle Motion’s performance, and when Donnie was burning down Jim Cunningham’s house. And it was probably also no mistake that Jim’s last name was Cunningham seeing as the word “cunning” means “Marked by or given to artful subtlety and deceptiveness.”     Tears for Fears – “Head Over Heels”   This song is the first song post-galaxy change. “Something happens and I’m head over heels” – that something is, let’s see, when the universe splits into two and Donnie finds himself on bizarroverse. Eventually it’s an action that Donnie commits later on in the movie that causes him to get through the film: He kills Frank. Frank is killed during the 28 day bizarro period and therefore able to exist and walk around as he wishes (as a sort of ghost), advising Donnie on what to do. If Donnie never shot and killed Frank towards the end of the movie he never would’ve been able to destroy the bizarroverse because Frank served as a helper. Anyway, basically this line is pretty impressively used if you’re as crazy as I am and over analyzing lyrics at 9:30 pm on a Friday night “It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand.”     [EDIT: there's a line at the end of this song that I haven't been able to find on any of the lyrics databases for this song. If I am hearing it correctly, what's being said at the very end of this song is: "One little boy, one little man. Funny how time flies." Donnie is a little boy, turned into a little man almost instantly, and in the directors cut of the movie he makes a reference to time flying. He makes time fly.]   If you’ve gotten this far, color me impressed. It’s pretty much downhill from here.    The Church – “Under the Milky Way”   I don’t know if this movie was the first time I heard this song since it seemed incredibly familiar to me the moment it came on screen. I wish I could remember exactly which part this song came in on since that might make some sort of difference for my purposes. In terms of when it was used in the movie: the song came on just after Donnie and Gretchen had sex for the first and last time (unless he fucked her corpse, you know, for old times). However, the line that works well for this is: “And it's something quite peculiar, something that's shimmering and white. Leads you here despite your destination, under the Milky Way tonight.” You know how Donnie keeps on following those silver orbs? Those are quite peculiar, shimmering, and sort of white. They lead him around despite what he thinks his destination should be – or rather they lead him to what his destination should be. It all happens under the Milky Way – which is out of it’s mind on that particular night.   [EDIT: In the directors cut they had this song playing while Donnie was driving in the car with his father. The song that played post coital changed to "The Killing Moon".]     Tears for Fears/Gary Jules – “Mad World”   Well, this is the last song we hear in the movie. We hear this song when Donnie finally gets everything back in order (after using his telekinesis powers to rip the engine thing off the wing of the airplane his mom and sister were on and cause a sort of time traveling machine that destroyed the parallel universe he was in – I shit you not, that’s what he did) . No more bizarre universe. No more dead girlfriend. No more dead bunnyman. It’s a crazy world, this world he lives in. This world we live in. And if it weren’t for the martyr by the name of Donnie Darko, we’d be dead.   [EDIT: I forgot to mention that the song contains the incredible line "I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I ever had." This is one of the most important lines of the song, and I totally forgot to mention it. There are a lot of theories that the entire movie was a prophetic dream of Donnie's, and that all the people in his life had a similar dream. If it was a prophetic dream, and he died in it, and he fell in love, then it'd be easy to say that it was the best he ever had.]   Thank you and good night.

       UH OH   Apparently I left my AIM on at work. This is a problem cause I'm home today since it's a summer Friday.  Thanks to anyone who came out to bar 13 last night for Jordan's birthday party. I had a lot of fun DJing. I don't really understand why people don't dance to "Waiting Room" by Fugazi -- but that don't matter, I'll play it anyway until i'm blue in the face.  I'll bring the tits, you bring the hits.

        WHY ARE YOU IN THAT STUPID BUNNY SUIT?   In case you forgot,  Donnie Darko - The Directors Cut  is in theaters now. For you New Yorkers, it's playing at the AMC on 42nd Street. I will probably be there when you're there because I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be.   Unless of course, that anywhere else is the Curiosa festival on Saturday. But if you didn't want to spend $60+ seeing the Cure, Interpol, and a band I kinda like called Muse, you can head over to the Village Idiot and have your very last beer there. Hide your sisters/girlfriends/daughters cause my brother will be there in full effect with his friends. If the guy in the wheelchair asks you to sit on his lap -- DON'T DO IT. They’re closing down the legendary tavern this weekend. I wasn’t allowed in there in the first place. My brother managed to have me banned.  Last night in the wee hours of the night, after my friends and I polished off a bottle of rum in the kitchen of SPIN offices after watching the Fever perform, we headed back to my house, ordered Rush Hour, snorted enough heroin to kill Pete Libertines (i'm kidding of course -- it he would've been fine), and talked about how music, just like friends sometimes, can come to you in phases and mean less to you years down the road.  For instance: In 1993 I was obsessed with the Beatles  Sgt Peppers  and REM. I wanted to be Michael Stipe. I made all my friends sing REM songs in those karaoke booths that you have at Bar Mitzvahs. Sadly, "Shiny Happy People" was the only thing available, and even more sadly, I knew all of Michael Stipes' dance moves from the video. I would even find a baseball cap to wear to the side like he did, and i think that somewhere in my parent's house there exists about 4 different versions of me doing this with my friends. "Baby Got Back" was fun to do as well. Particularly because back then I weighed about 70 lbs and lacked a "back" and didn't understand what "my anaconda dont want nothing if you aint got buns hon."   In 1994 I became obsessed with Nirvana. This obsession lasted about 3 years and intertwined with my obsession with Beck, Hole, and The Smiths (not to mention the crazed obsession I had with my brother's New Wave Hits of the 80s Vol 1-15 collection).  In 1997 I became obsessed with Radiohead and listened to them once a day for nearly three years. I became known around the SPIN offices as the intern with an unnatural obsession with Radiohead. That was followed with obsessions with The Walkmen, Interpol, and Placebo.   All those bands meant more to me than anything in the world. They helped me out with my hardest moments in my life. Heartaches, downfalls, sickness, sadness, those bands were there for me. But then, they'd serve their purpose or something would distract me and I'd have a new obsession (my emo band would be called Her Daily Obsession).   Bands are like friends in that way, for me at least. Some months/years, there's a person who is the closest person to me in my life. If anything happens they're the first person I call. Then that friend might move away to go to college, or pursue a job, or get a boy/girlfriend and I see that friend less and less. It doesn't mean that I love them any less, it just means that my dependency in them isn't so strong. Maybe I'm an emotionally detached person? Anyway, when I listen to REM, Nirvana, and Hole I'm able to appreciate them -- but I don't need them anymore. I'm friendly with them, and if they were actual people instead of songs, I'd want to get brunch with them and catch up on old times and tell them about the new crushes I have and how i'm soooo over John, Orin, Matt, Chris...

       BECOME A ROOMMATE    urlLink Greg the Boyfriend  is looking for a roommate. He lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and apparently has a really lovely apartment. I dont know cause I've never been. I don't like going to boys' apartments and I don't like going to Brooklyn, ever, so those are two huge strikes against me ever playing in their kiddie pool (not to mention the sight of me in a bathing suit is nothing I'd wish on anyone). The other day Greg coined a great concept: "When you date someone, you also date their friends. They are the in-laws of youth."  Greg is a fantastic writer.

        PANIC ON THE STREETS   My friend Rob, who happens to be one of the most wonderful people put on this earth that I know, is going to Dublin over the next two weeks. He's looking for stuff to do and so I'm wondering if anyone who reads this blog might be able to help him out, and if so, please share with the rest of the class by posting it in the comments section. Thank you.  Rob writes: "Any tips you have about your favorite cool places, clubs, bands, food, drink, ways of getting round town, etc. would do me a world of good.  Thank you, and may all your sons be bishops.  Morrissey said there was panic in the streets there, but he said the same thing about Dundee and Humberside.  The man Can't be trusted!"

        SEX, DRUGS, AND FARGO   'Allo. Fans of SPIN's very own Chuck Klosterman can finally gawk at him in person! TONIGHT! If you live in NYC, I strongly urge you to go to his reading at the Astor Place Barnes and Noble at 7:30pm. There, he will be talking about his book  urlLink Sex, Drugs, and CoCo Puffs - A Low Culture Manifesto , now available in paperback. If you haven't picked it up yet, now would be a good time cause you can have Chuck explain the book to you and sign it. One day that book might be worth a lot of money. Also, it's one of those books that nearly killed me cause I was so into reading it that I'd read it while I walked down the street, often times  just  avoiding traffic. It's that good.  Also, on a sort of related topic, some dentist liked to  urlLink inject sperm into the mouths of patients.  Yum.  Speaking of  urlLink horse sperm . Oh, we weren't?

       WE CAN PLANT A HOUSE, WE CAN BUILD A TREE   or a cake.  Today I am sore and tired. My father came over yesterday and built a wall for  urlLink Lindsay's  room and we tried to help him out as much as possible. Before she was pretty much sleeping in the kitchen with a chinese curtain diving things. It made it hard for me to get a late night snack or come in late at night w/out waking her up. My dad is a super hero and the wall looks amazing. It's removeable and goes up to the ceiling and in a couple of days we're all getting Divo (digital tivo) set up, so we'll never leave the house. Oh joy.  Things I learned this weekend:  - Always check ID and make sure they're of age. -  urlLink Brian  is an amazing DJ. - All the latino boys who live on the LES dress like Kevin Federline. All of them. GIGANTIC WHITE T-SHIRTS.

       EVERYONE WHO PRETENDED TO LOVE ME IS DRUNK   Last night I went to see the Hives at Irving Plaza, but because I'm graced with a 5'1" frame and an absurd refusal to wear platforms or heels anymore, I saw most of the show from the monitors in the back of the venue. Unless, of course, I was jumping up and down or peaking a view of the band between peoples' heads. I LOVE THE HIVES! Yes, I do. I CAN'T SEE THE HIVES! No, I can't. So for me to give a review of this show would be incredibly inappropriate and also inaccurate since I couldn't actually see the show and just managed to enjoy the music and the chance to dance around with my friends as people who employ me got me drunk.  After the show, the people who employ me got me more drunk. As I walked with my boss, an editor, a former roommate, and a friend to the after party I declared things such as my love for the guitarist of the Hives, Nicolas Arson, and the fact that I think sex is dirty. "SEX IS DIRTY!" I yelled to my  BOSS . She responded with "Well, what about Nicolas Arson? I don't think you can yell that at him." I told her that that would be my opening line. It wasn't. Instead, when i finally met Mr. Arson, my line was "Great show" and i hopped off. A white lie, since i didn't actually see the show, but I didn't know what to say by that point and I was drunk. I could either make a fool of myself or I could just be polite. I chose politeness. However, when I met up with Pelle I insisted on taking two photos with him, one smiling and one with my patented pouty face.  So back to the party action: It was at the Grammercy Hotel Bar. It was really quite nice with a bottle of vodka and mixer at every table, not to mention some mystery swedish foods on a buffet. As I sat on a couch enjoying a strong drink prepared by a friend I got roudy and hollared at some boy. Literally hollared. "YO!" He walked over. We chatted. I went to the bathroom and managed to get the entire place to sing "Boaderline" by Madonna. It was lika movie. Very odd. I came back out to the party, balance glasses on my head, was told not to flirt with the interns, danced around a bit I think. And then, when I realized that maybe I should go home, I hopped in a cab with my roommate and was whisked home. I guess i was in enough of a state that she found it appropriate to offer to tuck me in. My friends are nice.  So how was the show? Good question. I was told by those who are taller than me, that it was very good. How was the party? Drunk.   On another note:   urlLink Laura slash temp  has the best ever review of  urlLink an Elefant show  ever. I'm sad i missed the new songs.  urlLink Greg  and I were in a band for a short moment with the members of Elefant minus Diego called Debutaunt. We had a hit song in England called "Eleventeen Times." True story. Sort of.   urlLink The Stills  have a new video for "Lola Stars and Stripes" Directed by Oliver Gondry (he's done some amazing videos, whoa). What's exciting to me about this video is that for a split moment you can see my skinny friend Jordan running around in it. He found out about the video shoot from reading this blog. You can see Jordan  running around  too.   You can watch it here:  Windows:  urlLink 100k  |   urlLink 300k  |  urlLink 450k   Quicktime:  urlLink 56k  |  urlLink 100k  |  urlLink 300k  |  urlLink 450k    SWF:  urlLink 300k  |  urlLink 450k   What the label and band want you to know about this video is the following:    "The events of Sep 11 sparked a new concern and gave our generation a tangible moment to make our own. This post-9/11 period is OUR time: it is us middle-class kids with nothing to immediately or concretely worry about that have to seize the moment and incite change. The bombs will be on our side of the pond very soon if we do not do something about it. It is about more than romance this time, it's about the fate of the world." -Dave Hamelin of The Stills and the writer of “Lola.”  "When I did read the lyrics, the first image I got in my mind was them walking in a happy area, then them walking in an area devastated by war. Later, I decided to try to make it happen in a one-shot sequence.  I've been impressed by the 9/11 video footage of guys shooting the tower and running and still shooting when the towers fell. That's what I wanted the footage to look like.  It's not political, just the contrast war/peace" -Olivier Gondry  "The video for ‘Lola Stars And Stripes’ was filmed in Spanish Harlem in NYC. There is a conceptual link between the video and the events on September 11, but it merely references elements. The band members rise and fall (as if dead), as the song crescendos and de-crescendos. When the song is most explosive, animated explosions emphasize a wartime atmosphere as the band runs in a panic. At these points the video becomes black and white and the camera work has a more documentary feel to it. There is a degree of playfulness that is incorporated into the video. If we were too serious it might have come off as pretentious, heavy handed or silly. Working with Mr. Gondry was an honor. Firstly, being able to communicate in French was great! Secondly, he is very talented and great to work with" -Tim Fletcher of The Stills

       VH1 -- YOU'RE GONNA PAY!   As i was getting ready for work this morning I found my head transfixed on the TV while watching VH1's morning video programming. Here's what my brain would've said if it could talk:   Maroon 5:  Why do i like this guy's voice? He's hot. Whoa, he's making out with an older lady. I see why all my girlfriends are obsessed with this dude. Why do i like his voice?  Avril Lavigne:  Whoa, she's hot. I'd do her.   Keane:  Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Music nice. This is like gay brother music. My favorite song by Coldplay is "Politik" ... this is piano driven like it. I like Muse.    KarenRTAG:   i think there is crack in these photos   KarenRTAG:    urlLink http://www.e-michael.jp/gallery/pug009.2.jpg    Ultragrrrl:   THAT MIGHT be my favorite.   KarenRTAG:   i really dont have one   KarenRTAG:   i just cant choose   Ultragrrrl:   wanna hear something evil?   KarenRTAG:   sure!

       HOLY FUCKING SHIT      urlLink JERUSALEM - A young monkey at an Israeli zoo has started walking on its hind legs only — aping humans — after a near death experience, the zoo's veterinarian said Wednesday.   It seems almost fated that a possible evolutionary milestone is happening in the Holy Land. It's almost like a sign. The sign being that God wants us to watch Planet of the Apes.

       I WANNA BE SEDATED   It was awesome seeing my friend  urlLink Jake  on VH1's "I Love The 90s" all this past week and weekend. When I was in high school I was totally in awe of him and had massive crush. What was there not to like? He was cute, had cool taste in music, a cool show on MTV, and he was like 14. Here's him  urlLink interviewing Joey Ramone  before his voice cracked (which i guess could be any time between age 12 and 23). Fantastic interview!

       urlLink     HE ONCE PUT THE EMO IN CHEMO   My friend Sean McGrath, who tragically lost his battle with cancer last month, recorded the song called "I Hate This Stupid Bike" for the Vagrant compilation "In Honor: A Compilation To Beat Cancer." You can stream it  urlLink HERE . Please play it loud, it's a rocking song.  You can contribute to the charity his family set up  urlLink Hold Onto Your Friends  by going to that hyperlink. And if you're a fan of the band Thursday, you can buy a special made t-shirt.  Also, I should note that about a year ago when I was chatting on AIM with Sean, as we did whenever he would sign on and IM me with the endearing greeting of "hey nerdo," I asked him how cancer was treating him... his response was "I put the emo in chemo." Despite being sick, he didn't let that fuck with his sassy sense of humor, and so this post's subject line is trying to celebrate that... cause he would've wanted it that way. Trust me.

       LET THEM EAT STUFF   Max Dropout thinks that Franz Ferdinand are 3 generation Talking Heads hacks and hates pretty much everything else in popular culture, including yours truely... yet he continues to read and post on this site. Perhaps you share in Max's hatred of all things popculture (which sort of seems very  urlLink Buddyhead  to me) and would enjoy his online zine  urlLink Let Them Eat Lead . He's invited all the hoes who read this blog over.   I like things too much (according to him, my taste is ignorant) to read his zine, but some people seem to like it.

       RUN FOR COVER MOTHERFUCKER   So, what did you do friday night? Something fabulous, I'm sure. Me? Oh, funny you should ask. Let's see, I went to New Jersey to eat shabbat dinner with my family, kiss my doggy on her blind head, and sit infront of a computer screen trying to look for something to entertain me enough while watching FUSE. Thanks for asking.   I really enjoy going to NJ to pay my respects to the G to the O to the D. I think that tradition is totally lost in our/my generation. Whenever I tell people that I'm not going out on friday because I'm being a good jew, they look at me like i just said that Franz Ferdinand are hacks (they're not, by the way). But, with all due respect, I gotta say that lately my friends have been totally understanding and cool about my chosen arrangement (my homobro chooses to spend his in the hamptons or with his homofriends doing homostuff). I really enjoy it. It's kind of counter-culture, and being counter-culture is what being punk is about... so by default of being semi-traditional with my religious values, i'm punk. HEAR ME ROAR! roar.  Speaking of traditional values, the Franz Ferdinand album makes me wanna have casual sex in public. I just read in Blender magazine that Brad Pitt enjoys that album as well, so i hope he feels the same way as I do.

       LONG TIME COMING   So last night I went to see the Delays with my exboss. I had made the mistake of saying "they sound like stevie nicks crossed with MBV" which was totally off. Basically, I need to stop listening to the same track "zero zero one" (which does sound like the above mentioned description... actually more cocteau twins, so i was TOTALLY OFF) over and over again. They were fantastic. The singer's voice carried over the crowd like a wave of mutilation. I stared in awe as he yelped like a crazed voice with an uncommonly fantastic voice. At times, it reminded me of  urlLink JJ72  (remember them? i loved them).   My brother Lawrence has started an amazing new company called  urlLink RentBid . It's like eBay but for apartment rentals and it's totally fucking unreal. You dont have to pay a brokers fee or anything. The site just launched last week so there aren't that many listings, but I just found a 3 bedroom rental in harlem for $1500. No fee! Czech it.   urlLink She's lost control .  Does anyone have the new Midtown record? Their "Aremageddon" vs. Muse's "Apocalypse Please"... it's like STP vs. Pearl Jam, but for one fucking song!  Lastly, I don't know if I've mentioned this yet, but Alex Chow's band,  urlLink Madison Strays  is playing tonight at the  urlLink Mercury Lounge . They sound like the Psychedellic Furs. They're also playing with everyone's favorite disco punk bands  urlLink The Flesh  and  urlLink The Moving Units . All three are fucktastically awesome bands. Probably your new favorite!

       BREAKING NEWS    urlLink Penn brothers want Bush in frat, not the White House   I honestly can't decide which quote is more fascinating:   "I think I would rather have Kerry hold my feet during a keg stand because, let's face it, you need... someone responsible to do something like that," Penn junior Patrick Carroll said.  "You wouldn't want to fall and chip your teeth on the keg or something, and I could just picture 'college-era' Bush seeing a hot girl across the room and dropping everything he was doing to go talk to her," the Kappa Alpha brother said.  "Nader wouldn't have a chance," Brodsky explained. "Kerry is cool because he has morals, something G.W. and Nader do not, but George Bush is the only one that I can see playing Beirut [aka Beer Pong] while shot-gunning a Natty Ice. So I guess I'd have to pick Bush."

         I LIKE STUFF, HE LIKES STUFF, THAT'S COOL   In an amazing turn of events, MTV's fantastic show, "Room Raiders," has ventured out of Bergen County, NJ and into Miami tonight! Oh joy!  urlLink Karen  are you on top of this?  I went to see Dennis' new band  urlLink The Sons of Sound . Holy shit! Run, do no walk, to their next show. As soon as I find out when it is, i'll post it here. Watching their set tonight was like seeing a combination of  urlLink Muse  and  urlLink Secret Machines  with a slight disco punk beat. Truely fantastic. The songs are there, the sound is there, everything was there. Shockingly, I think it's something like their 2nd show as a full band. Dennis used to be the lead singer of the Realistics, and his new band is nothing like it, so don't show up expecting that sort of thing.  J'adore le Family Guy. So should you. Now you can buy Family Guy  urlLink action figures . This is so much awesome.  Growing up my brother Lawrence was a huge fan of Andrew Dice Clay. I must say, the dude is  urlLink still awesome .  Also, one of my friendsters/slight internet crushes, Ollie, has a band in LA called  urlLink The Ooh Las . I've never met Ollie in person, but I always thought she looked really pretty in photos. So when I found out she had a band I was pretty suprised and eager to hear what they sound like. Low and behold, she sounds a bit like Kim Deal and I was quite impressed. Anyway, her band is looking for drummer, so if you're a drummer in LA please  urlLink check this out .   So, since this blog is about my sobriety (or more often, lack there of, I figured that I'd share that tonight I didn't have one drop of alcohol. Impressed? Didn't think so. Earlier in the night, I was debating going over to Filter 14 for the Girls & Boys reunion party which is happening right now and probably off the hook. But I am exhausted. I need sleep, no alcohol, and nothing else in my body that doesn't belong there. This weekend is Siren Festival so I will probably be unable to walk straight for the next week. Viva being drunk beyond retardation!  OK, this post was boring. No personality. Sorry. Hopefully you found out about some cool bands and stuff!

       I SEE THAT YOU'VE COME TO RESIST ME     Apart from seeing Anchorman last night and listening to the new Interpol album on repeat 39 times, the most exciting thing to happen to me this weekend was going to Misshapes. I came with  urlLink Niki  and  urlLink Brian  dressed in all white from the 40oz extravaganza that was the White Party, and arrived on a drunkfest of dancers. I need to remind myself to give up wearing heels. I hate them, they hate me, and after about a half hour of standing around and maybe dancing a bit (i REALLY dont remember), I decided it was time to go home. Oh, but this was just after a boy, who was standing near the DJ booth, toppled over. Just like... timber style. The poor boy hit his head on his way down and under a counter just at Brian's feet. So a few people propped him up and Brian carried him out with a bouncer cause, Holy Cute Drunken Boy, Batman, it was clear that this boy needed to go home. Sadly, the boy was still outside about 15 minutes later leaning against a wall. He looked like a poor puppy. We went over to help him out and figure out how to get him home. I took his wallet out of his pants and handed it over to Brian who did some investigating and found out where he lived. His phone was dead so we couldn't call any of his friends. We tried to get him in a cab and Niki tried to convince me not to take him home. I love strays! After trying to get him to let us put him in a cab for about 10 minutes, Niki grabbed my hand and led me to a cab so  we  could go home.   Anyway, I posted a  urlLink missed connection  for the boy to make sure he made it home OK. Still no word. Hope he's alright!   By the way,  urlLink Greg  went to see  urlLink The Five O'Clock Heroes  at  urlLink Mercury Lounge  on Friday and said that they were fantastic. I am pretty much in love with their song "Run to Her." Sadly, their website is acting up, so you might have to check back.

       CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY HEART AND SOUL   this is a wasteland now     OK, it's only July (it took me a moment to think of what month it was, yikes), and I'm already fretting over what my favorite album of the year will be. I've got it narrowed down to five, but choosing the order is causing me to break out in hives:   Interpol -  Antics  The Killers -  The Hot Fuss  Franz Ferdinand -  Franz Ferdinand  My Chemical Romance -  Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge  Muse -  Absolution   My gosh! Um... I really fucking love music. My ears are constantly happy and 2004 has made my ears dance so much!  What's your top five?  (btw, if you're wondering why Modest Mouse is missing, it's because whenever i listen to the album i skip directly to "float on" and play it on repeat until someone throws a shoe at my head)  Also, totally off topic, but i've got the strongest urge to take Ashlee Simpson under my wing. I honestly think i can be a good influence on her. I feel like she's lost and needs guidence and I am just the right person to give that guidence to her. I'd make her mix tapes. Take her to shows. Help her write songs. It'd be so much fun. She'd also end up a raging alcoholic, but i mean, she wants to be rock and roll right?

       MY CHEMICAL BLOG   Get ready to hate me for ruining your productivity. Play  urlLink tetris .  Play tetris while listening to "Angst in my Pants" on repeat, which  urlLink Scott  kindly uploaded for me  urlLink here .  NEWS FLASH!   Jude Law is really motherfucking  urlLink hot   So is  urlLink Ashlee Simpson . C'mon, don't be hating... you know you wanna stick your hand in her cleave.  Last night i was riding my bike on Houston at about 2 am from Lit where I was celebrating Raphael the Boyfriend's birthday when who do i see? None other than Shandi from the second season of America's Next Top Model. I nearly got into an accident gawking. She was my favorite!  So immediately after spying her, i rang up Karen to let her know. I was just driving by Welcome to the Johnsons on my way home and out pops Johnny Knoxville. I was like "Hi Kare-- holy shit. Johnny Knoxville." And peddled away.  Lastly, I don't know if you guys like to party, but if you do,  urlLink ProductShopNYC  and Halified will be throwing a funtastic party. Here's the rules:  "If you don't know the drill, let me lay the track down for ya. Ya gots to wear all white clothing - that means ALL WHITE CLOTHING. You gots to drink either champagne or 40s - no cheap ass cracker shit. And that's it. can ya dig it? I knew ya could! We're going to be laying down the phattest beats all night, everything from Mase to Nas to Biz Markie to Lil' Kim to Rakim to Kriss Kross to B.I.G., and all you got to do is show up."

Ryan Rayhil either doesn't like Jesus, Asians, or Alex Chow... you  urlLink which .  Speaking of Asians,  urlLink this  is weird.  Thank you  urlLink Jon Hurwitz  for gracing me with the  urlLink Bloc Party  music video that you can watch  urlLink here . I really, really, really want to see a video for "She's Hearing Voices.  And lastly, "Angst in My Pants" by Sparks is such a fucking great song. People, how are we allowing this gem to die? You can listen to a 30 second clip of it  urlLink here  but that's really not enough. Look for the song on itunes and make sure you don't buy the remix like I accidently did.

       GOTTA GOTTA GET UP   My friend Bruce is a genius. He pointed out that the way Brandon Flowers sings in the beginning of The Killers song "Mr. Brightside" sounds exactly like the way the guy from Underworld sings in "Born Slippy." (aka the awesome techno song from the  Trainspotting  soundtrack that ushered me to my very first tragically drunken night in 1996 causing me to get grounded for about 2 years.)

       YOU SHOULD BE IN MY SPACE, YOU SHOULD BE IN MY LIFE   Guess what? The Interpol album sounded better today. How the fuck? It's like a virus that spreads and spreads awesomeness. I wonder how much money  urlLink My Space  will offer the band for permission to use the song "NARC" which has the lyric of the this post's subject heading.  I sort of want to drink a bottle of wine (something I never do, seriously), light a candle, and be all gothemo and listen to this album and cry about how pretty the sounds and lyrics are.  Over the weekend I had a bunch of friends visit me. Amy and Shaun from LA who decided to take a quickie trip to NYC before Shaun had to go back on tour with his band for Warped Tour. My friend Bruce, whom was here from London (originally from New Zealand), also stayed over at the same time and it never felt cramped in my bedroom. We spent the nights dancing at  urlLink Motherfucker  (me and a friend joke that if we ever got married, our wedding would have to be at Motherfucker ... and our son's bris... and our passover seders...) and  urlLink Misshapes  (you can see photos of all the new hot and slutty misshapers  urlLink here ), and brunching and watching countless episodes of "Family Guy" and they became addicted to SPARKS thanks to me and Karen. By the way, Karen has vowed to stop drinking so much SPARKS... seems she's "losing time."  My roof is apparently the best place to see fireworks in NYC so I invited a bunch of people at the last minute to my impromptu BYOB shindig. Everyone was kind enough to bring me a bottle of booze whenever they came over, so i was pretty fucking gone by the time the fireworks began. I ran around kissing boys on my roofdeck and canoodling with republican orthodox jewish boys whom used to be so religious that giving me a hug would've been a sin in their eyes. Karen and I attempted to get people to sing the National Athem... that didn't work so well.   Once the fireworks were over  urlLink Briankeepsadiary  rallied up a posse of people to go over to David Lee Roth's apartment down the block cause apparently he was also having a party. However, once they got there (i stayed home to decompress), the party was over so they posed next to DLR's mazzuzah and mailbox (which apparently just says DLR -- I was hoping it'd say Diamond Dave). Fun times.  Lastnight I finally went to that party at Happy Endings that Alex Chow had been telling me about for a thousand years that I  was always too lazy to go to. Fuck, I blew it. So many cute faces, so many fashionable kids, so many good tunes. It was Bruce's last night in NYC and I really hope he had a fun time. Here's a photo of us practicing  urlLink Blue Steel  at Happy Endings.  OK. Time to sign off. Thanks again to everyone for sending me their cutie pet photos!  Here's a photo of my blind shih-tzu. She's 15 years old and I was babysitting her for the day a week ago. I love her so much that I resisted petting other dogs for about 12 years cause that'd make her jealous. I want to hug her all day long and I miss her on the weekdays. Anyway, she's blind, so I was sort of surprised when she sat up and started watching TV.

        ROSEMARY, HEAVEN RESTORES YOU IN LIFE   Alright, so I've downloaded the new Interpol album. To be perfectly honest, the first time I heard it I was like "this is good... but yeah, it's good." Despite being a fan since 1999 or 2000 or something (not to pull shit like that out...), it took me about a week or two to agree with my friend that  Turn on the Bright Lights  was an orgasmic album. It was a grower. For whatever reason I thought that  Antics  would appeal to me instantly. It was appealing, but definitely not something that made me feel less complete if I didn't listen to it at least once in the day. I thought something was wrong with me. Paul's lyrics/voice was definitely stunning, and the band sounded really grand and epic, as promised. But the emotional pull was missing.  Then this weekend happened. Suddenly, like an anvil falling on a coyote's head, I was struck down by its absolute gorgeousness. Paul has such a way with lyrics sometimes -- he's able to make the most ridiculous line sound like absolute poetry written by Rimbaud -- and the band knows how to make those statements sound like the most profound declarations of all time with their swooping sounds that suddenly become soundtracks to your life.  The other day I was riding my bike through the city when "Take You on a Cruise" came on. I must've yelled "i am the scavenger!" really loudly cause everyone started staring at me. And last week I DJed the single "Slow Hands" at Crobar and people were actually dancing to it. I was pretty stoked.  This album just gave me a boner.

       ANTI-CLIMATIC!   OK! So all that t-minus bull shit... that was like, retarded. Basically, I'm back. I'm gonna start blogging again... but I guess I never left. I'm debating taking that comments feature down because it gives me a headache tho, so please don't be surprised when that happens.  Fuck, I forgot how to blog. Sort of.  I went to see the Streets last night at Irving Plaza and spent the majority of the show in the back of the venue dancing it up with  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Niki  in celebration of Karen's 23rd birthday. Holla! We tried out a bunch of new dance moves like the pancake toss (which apparently is ALL the rage in St. Louis), accosted boys who walked by challenging them to a dance off, and yelled at "Oi" whenever we remembered to. Just for the record, the only reason we yelled out "oi" is because Mikey yells it out about every 30 seconds on his album, as does show opener Dizzee Rascal... however, Karen thought i was hollering "Oy!" which is possible.  Karen was kind enough to grace me with a copy of some  urlLink Bloc Party  cd that she's been going on and on about -- and the shit is really good. I'm fearful that I've just found a new obsession.  Other things catching my ear:   urlLink The Bravery  -- every time i hear a DJ spin one of their songs I'm always like "I know this! I like this! Who is this? ... oh snap! it's the Bravery!" They're playing tonight at Bar13.   urlLink My Chemical Romance  -- yes they're "emo" or "screamo" or whatever... but fucking shit, these guys made a great second album, and that's sometimes pretty hard. Either you live up to expectation, you surpass expectation, or the first album was so good that you just have no choice but to release music for the sake of releasing music... and MCR totally surpassed my expectations. I cried when I first heard their album. It's gorgeous.   urlLink Giant Drag  -- i'm sort of obsessed with them actually. If you live in LA, they're doing a residencey at Spaceland I think. Go see them and tell me how they are live. I have a crush on Annie.  Also, please send me photos of your pets if you get a chance. Or any cute animal photos. I like those. my email: slewitinn@spin.com

       SARAH'S SO BORING EVER SINCE SHE GOT OLD   On a normal given evening, let's say about a year ago, I would've been hanging out on the streets of NYC until 4am everynight, coming to work hungover and useless (despite my efforts at sobriety) the next morning. Those days aged me faster than I would've ever anticipated.  These days I'm constantly checking my watch. Is it midnight yet? Can I go home and not feel totally useless and lifeless? There are nights when I've got about 3 things to do and end up blowing them all off in exchange for a quiet night in front of the TV ordering sushi and shutting my brain off.  I think one of the problems is my fondness for saturday night blow outs. I stagger home when the sun is out and sleep until the sun goes down on sunday these days. That is, of course, unless my mom or dad decide to make a surprise visit to my house to either build a wall or drop off my blind dog so i can baby sit her.  Saturday was Brian's birthday party at MisShapes. I spent the day with my mom running errands (which included going to Saks to return the $700+ of bikinis she bought me on a whim in hopes to finally get my ass out of the city and on to a beach for some R&R, and going to Whole Foods to pick up Brian's cake). I made it back home with just enough time to nap for a half hour, eat a bit, watch some TV, and shower so I could get to Brian's house, down a Sparks, throw him in a cab, and dance.  A posse arrived at MisShapes at around 11:30. It was crowded, but not too bad. I met up with my friend Kris who was visiting from the OC (the county, not the TV show). Kris handed me a handful of magic asprins that I took immediately... which immediately meant that I was hyper off the Sparks, drunk off the alcohol, and in love with the world thanks to the magic asprins. I remember dancing at probably 3 am with Greg The Boyfriend and Raphael and some mystery girl as James Iha was DJing. Pretty James Iha with his lovely flowing blond hair. I pinched his ass when I saw him and I think he thought it was some psycho girl he didn't know. I think he was relieved to see that I was actually some psycho girl he knows. I remember him playing the New Radicals song "Get What You Give" that i've been itching to DJ for about 4 years, and have just been too fucking chicken to rock. He pulled it off with grace and the boy can beat match, which is a lot more than i can do on a given day. But I guess when it comes to being a rockDJ, it's just a matter of playing fun songs and not playing Franz Ferdinand twice in an hour no matter how badly you want to.  So anyway, I'm trying to remember the events that happened on Saturday. I can't. I can, but sort of in a way one remembers a really fun dream. One where they're in the middle of a breathing dancefloor with fantastic lights and amazingly loud music holding the hands, hips, hearts of people close to you. I do, however, remember Greg telling me that he's getting married. I remember dragging him outside and possibly rudely pushing people aside so I could get him outside since he had some 'splainin to do. He 'splained. I stood in near silence. And then got distracted when a cute boy from my office walked by and focused my attention on telling this boy from my office how cute I thought he was. How pretty i thought he was was actually what I said.   In reflection, I picture this little "attention span bug" hopping on the heads of people, almost like a game of Sims. The attention span bug was invisibly hopping on Greg's head, and then it hopped to the head of the boy from my office, and then it hopped onto the heads of the Five O'Clock Heros, whom I (dis)gracefully introduced myself to by complaining about their website for not working. This band, by the way, gets my vote for cutest NYC band this week. Thankfully, they're actually really good as well.   My attention span bug then started hopping across the street so I could cheat the long line of Luke and Leroys in favor of a shorter line at some Tavern. I impatiently walked into the boy's bathroom, noticed it full as well, and hopped back onto the women's line. My invisible attention span bug is gonna get me in trouble one day.  We stayed at MisShapes until 5:30. This was after Pete the Doorguy stamped some French ambassador on the face with a reentry stamp. This was after we ate chocolate cake and wished Brian a happy birthday. This was after i made out with Grant. This was after Brian got a photo of my ass crack. This was after Kris pretty much passed out on the couch and talked to me in an amazing slurred speech. This was after flirting with some other boy named Chris. This was after my brother left. This was after a lot of things I'm surely forgetting.  But one thing I'm not forgetting is how much fun it was to be there in the first place. I wish my body was equipped for 4am bedtimes and bar hopping like it used to be.

       WHAT ARE  YOU DOING TONIGHT?   Cancel your plans and go see the Morning After (it's a different band than Morning Theft).   Where? Oh, this place called Pianos.  Who? The Morning After + Mic Harrison (of Superdrag) + The Kelly Affair + The Vandervoorts  The Morning After go on and 10:30ish and I once beat up the guitarist when we got really drunk and made him play me his band's demo and I was like "Whoa. You guys are actually good."   Then he gave me a blow job in the bathroom so I would write about his band on my blog. True story.

       I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN   But, my heart  urlLink will go on .  Hey, you know that band called  urlLink Morning Theft  that I told you about last week and said they were awesome and totally a band to watch out for.  Well, they're playing Luna Lounge with The Go Station for free. People I urge you to check out Morning Theft. They're like 90s nostalgia but not corney, totally sexy, and fucking catchy.   Me and my brother decided that the Go Station was totally the new Toad the Wet Sproket. We liked TTWS.  Info:  .morning theft. thursday, 8/12/04 luna lounge, nyc ludlow btwn houston & stanton 8pm start, 21+, FREE!!! w/the go station

       BEST AIM CONVERSATION EVER   My little cousin Maurice is 17 and in a cover band. The kid is amazingly talented, and i'm not just saying that cause he's my cousin, i'm saying it cause it's true. When Maurice was 15 I took him to see My Chemical Romance and I guess it sort of changed his life cause after that he started listening to better bands and got really serious into performing music. He always had a shockingly good voice with great tone and fantastic pitch, but just totally lacked the motivation to start a band cause he figured he should do like the kids in his school and community and open a store once he finished high school. Finally he realized he could sing in a punk band and started one with his school friends. Mind you, they all go to yeshiva (jewish day school), so they're in the "no shows on friday nights" ghetto. Fun times.  Anwyay, Maurice is an amazing performer. He handled his second show with the charisma and stage presence of a seasoned pro, emulating Gerard Way from MCR.   So we're sitting here on our friday night -- both of us stuck at home cause we've both finished our shabbat dinner at our homes and are winding down. He starts IMing me about some Vice party he saw in Vice magazine. Totally freaking out about all the coke and whores they show. Then he's telling me about a show he performed on thursday in Deal, NJ and how the audience of all these uptight syrian jews started a mosh pit so crazy that he and his guitarist jumped into it. Then he was telling me about covering Muse. Apparently they were about to play "Time is Running Out" but decided to have a little break down into "Bliss" and everyone freaked out. Then we had a half hour conversation about the different pedals Matt Bellamy uses -- which pretty much consisted of me saying "he's got custom made guitars and theyr'e built right in." and him saying "no way!" So if anyone could tell me what kind of pedals matt uses so i can tell him i'd really appreciate it. I just love the fact that I had an IM with my cousin about this. It makes me really proud to be related to someone so fucking cool! He's only 17!

       I CAUGHT YOU A DELICIOUS BASS   I love it when readers send me awesome things they find out or learn on the job. Robin, from LA, just sent me this since i'm a HUGE fan of ND:   So I know you are a fan of Napolean Dynomite so I thought you would be interested in this.  I was lucky enough to go on a shoot for work to the Staples Center....where the X Games are....on tuesday with Napolean(Jon Heder) and a bunch of Pro Skate Boarders like Bob Burnquist and Danny Way.  It was HILARIOUS!  Napolean interviewed the skaters asking them if they could go mock 30 down the ramp, etc.  The ramp looked like Free Fall at Great Adventure..it was so high they had to take an elevator up to the top.  They called it the MEGARAMP.  Then Napolean went to the top with his bike looking like he was gonna go down.."i'm gonna go! GOSH! Will you wait a flippin second?!"       Anyway if you wanna watch it, or tivo it or tape it....it will be on Kilborn tonight 8/5.  12:30 CBS.  Its probably about 5 minutes...but I think it is gonna be pretty flippin funny.  It will be on before the first commercial.

        PARTY! WOOO!   There's one little gadget that I've been eyeing for the past couple of months and that's the T-Mobile sidekick. It's this handheld device that has the internet, email, instant messenger, a calander, phonebook, phone, and probably a shitload of other functions that I haven't heard of yet. Anyway, you can apparently buy it for like $150 and then get a rebate and after the rebate it's $99. At least that's what it says  urlLink here . All my musician friends have been busting them out like they're yesterday's news. But i'm slow when it comes to current events, so for me, it's the future.  So you might be asking yourself, Sarah, what's that gotta do with party? Well, the fine people at t-mobile had a party in LA (i assume it's LA cause Paris was there).   She's funny and  urlLink hot .  Samaire dyed her hair  urlLink brown .   urlLink This girl  looks like my friend Kim TB, who happens to be the prettiest girl in all the universe.  Bijou don't  urlLink give a fuck . She's like, I'm gonna just throw on whatever. This is why she's awesome. It's almost like she's Paris and Nicki's cousin from out of town that they gotta bring to all the parties cause their parents told them too. And since Bijou is from out of town she doesn't have the cool clothes that the other kids have so she rocks what she's got. But surprise, surprise, she's more wild and crazy than they ever could expect. She becomes the life of the party and  in the process manages to warm the heart of the evil puppy killer who gives up killing puppies, meaning Bjiou saved the day.  Or, she'll just look at Nicki and go  urlLink "Mmmm... Food  as Paris catches  urlLink  her reflection  in a T-Mobile Sidekick 2.   Speaking of Paris,  urlLink check out the song she recorded  to be her single but it was taken from her and given to someone else, i forget who. Maybe Lindsay Lohan. It's pretty good and if it's actually her singing, her voice isn't bad.  Remember how i once said you should see the movie "Girl Next Door"? Here's a  urlLink good reason .   urlLink This band  is called Last Amanada. I saw that photo and said to the gremlins in my head "they look swedish." Googled them, and I was right. Fucking Sweedes.  More  urlLink party people here .  On a totally different note, I made  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Lindsay  indulge me in my "If you put the tracks of Muse's  Absolution  in reverse order and start them at the beginning of the tangent universe in Donnie Darko, i am certain they'll sync up." It did for some songs, but mostly at the end when the clock struck midnight or something and i cued up "Time is Running Out" which then pretty much lined up Donnie's and Matt's shared vocal proclimation of "time is running out!!!" The song then went into "Apocalypse Please" (because I had it going in reverse order, remember) and it fit really perfectly with the world ending in the movie (cause Donnie was destroying the universe to save it) and the part when Matty Bells sings "it's the ennnnnnnnnnd... yaaaaaaaaaauwhoaaaaaa this is the ennnnnnnd of THA WORLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLD." Yeah, we were sort of stoned. But it works!!!  Then I went to see  urlLink Dogs Die In Hot Cars  and they were totally fucking great. I remember not liking them when I saw them in London last november but this time around, i guess they got tigheter, and made me dance and be happy and jolly. Andrea and Karen were spot on when comparing them to Dexy's Midnight Runners. Sadly, no overalls. But the singer looks like Josh Hartnett to me.   urlLink Pitty Sing  also played and whoooo! I don't even feel like it's fair for me to compare last night's show to the one I saw a bunch of months ago. They really fucking great live. The singer  reminds me of Matt from Muse a little in the way his vocals are totally over the top but at the same time totally fucking appropriately so. They showed off a bunch of new songs, but the one that i love the most, "Radio," really shined. Thankfully, the band refrained from kicking my ass off stage (due to a sour review i gave them months ago), so they could kick ass on stage.    The night's headliner,  urlLink Morning Theft , is another band to watch, but when you go watch them, bring ear plugs cause they bring their sound to 11. Musically, they're in the same vain (vein?) as Muse (apparently my favorite band to compare other bands to today), with dramatic and hard hitting guitar lines, and vocally Rob sounds a bit like Kurt Cobain. Little girls are gonna love him.

       ... SO OUR COUNTRY CAN BE FREE   Lastnight a  urlLink bunch  of  urlLink Jews  got together to talk about controlling the media and started laughing about  urlLink this little jem . Sasha Baron Cohen is a motherfucking genius.  When I first heard Radiohead's acoustic version of "Creep" that's on the Trickster EP I cried. So I was overjoyed when Kavin Kavin sent  urlLink this .  Go to Rothko tonight if you can. Two bands that are totally awesome ( urlLink Morning Theft , and  urlLink Pitty Sing ) are playing with Dogs Die In Hot Cars.  urlLink Jenny Penny  is gorgeous and will be DJing.  Also, if you don't have tickets to Curiosa, hurry up and buy them. I think they're going for 2-for-1 now, and absolutely worth it. I shit you not when I say that Muse's set was beyond mind-blowing. Matt Bellamy is a genius.  And look. A baby hippo:
