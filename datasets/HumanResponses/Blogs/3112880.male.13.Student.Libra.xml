       Haiz... Its been a long time since i last posted.. We have been too busy with that History Drama competition coming up next saturday... rehearsals almost every day! in addition to all that work... I've been coming home @ like 7, 8 pm everyday this week..   Wednesday was nationals... Everyone was supposed to go (for VS!! compulsory) However, on that day, the teacher last minute told us that she wanted to have rehearsals that day, and had also got approval from the relevant ppl already... so we had rehearsals until 2 pm. (we started at 1 pm) After that, erm the 4 of us, isaac, lester, desmond and i planned to go there (we could still make it!!) But that ***** of a jonathan wanted me to accompany him and jeremy to bugis to take a look at the costumes with mrs ng... yah.. screw him... i couldnt go lor...   took mrs ng's car.. maroon toyota corolla. still very new. jona was making lots of noise with jeremy at the back.. playing with little square piggy pillows. ng forced me to sit in front.  -----------------------------------------------------------   regarding the rehearsals, i think we have made quite good progress already!!! especially movement and placement.. hope we win again! its on homeground...  -----------------------------------------------------------   had dental appointment today.. such a waste of time, wasted 2 hours waiting. the person before me had an extraction, and another had gum disease,o_0 so it took an awful long time. :(   mrs jay wasnt here today, she broke her back yesterday and cant walk. poor woman! so mr lai took over 2/5 of her periods. the other 3/5 was spent doing el work she asked a teacher to give us...  -----------------------------------------------------------   next week will be our last and final rounds of full dress rehearsals... X-Country next wednesday too. hmm what else... yah nicole's bright idea is to organise a kindergarten class reunion. what crap is that? i dont think there is anything is it? mark's birthday is next monday (2/8)...

        RHD today... so boring.. The PRC teachers came to observe our math lesson. We had very early recess. (9 a.m) then followed by 1 period of history. (until 1010)       Then it was followed by stupid kolam designing. You know those Indian decoration thingies that you see on the floor... >_<>     Firstly, because it was all messy and we had no experience whatsoever.     Secondly, we ran out of materials.     Thirdly, the design was all screwed.     Fourthly, no one in our class was good in art let alone being in aep.   Fifthly, the whole thing was just a failure.    Our class's kolam was the worst compared to the rest of the classes. Totally embarrasing. Mrs Jay said that we should owe it to our bad organisation and planning... Whatever.    The teacher's ethnic costumes were just as spastic. It was like Mr Tan won the prize for best dressed male teacher. HE is like... g*y? c***y? He wore his peranakan costume...    Mr Koh wore this tight white shirt, and a very very short sarong with slippers. Looked kind of akward and revealing. They were talking about how he brushed against the table and revealed something. eek.    Mrs Jay wore her usual ethnic clothes. So did mrs ng. yah. the rest of the teachers wore other clothes too. not worth mentioning.    The presentation afterwards was very boring... ended school at 1.25 today. We had to clear up the stupid kolams. Only Jeremy and I cleared up. The rest slacked. Isaac came to help sweep a bit and take out the masking tape.     As we were leaving, that id**tic mr lai called us back "leon!!... lester!...." apparently he could not tell who was who. lester wasnt even in school! Laisy was like crying out frantically (think somebody save me.... ) to us, to help him remove the tape. >:    screw da huren.    took 76. isaac and i were waiting for the bus when HL came with his gay friend. We all boarded that double decked bus.   The 4 of us talked along the way... mostly crap too. especially HL, his gay friend and crushes.   Marcus boarded the bus too with some of his friends at vj.     I called jonathan. He had smsed me telling me to call him when school finished. He was very sick and had a cold. so i called him, we talked abit. Mostly about the stupid kolam. He claims that if he was in school, it would not have been such a failure, and that without him, 2k is useless. WHAT RUBBISH.    Haiz... Tomorrow i'm presenting my crp project. lit sucks...

       Desmond, Jon and James came over work on the math project today... Welll not really. We were taking 76 to my house... When it was time to get off, we got off. All but James. He was sleeping, from school all the way there. And he had never been to my house before! So we got off, leaving him on the bus.   We then proceeded to my house to start on the project. We tried calling James, but his hand phone was off! lol.. At like about 5 p.m, he called from his home. Apparently, he had woken up only a few stops later, finding out that we were all missing. He got off, at Jon's house. He went to his block, but could not remember which floor it was. 'Was it 10 or 12?'. It was 8!!!... He wanted to see if our shoes were there. But the problem was that jon normally puts shoes in the house and not outside. LOL.   So in the end, James just went home.... Awww... so sad...   We did quite a bit of the project... Not much progress in 1 1/2 hours. Yay not much homework due tomorrow...

       Okay. I'm gonna type this as fast as i can. Today we had math again. Mr Lai was teaching speed time graphs. He was using my worksheets to teach. *so chad chad. Then he gave us work to do (my worksheets!). Everyone in class was cursing me for giving them so much work. lol. I'M EVIL!!! MUAHAHAHA... *so bizzare!  Well... We had the stupid history test today. It was supposed to be a revision of Semester 1's work which is like WHOA!! so MUCH.... but. it was like only 3 questions (open ended) There was question 1 part A plus B, then question 2 part A,B,C. and question 3. the questions were quite easy. it was like describe 2 problems farquhar faced and how he solved them. (3 marks question)  Then there was the 6 marks LORMS question... damn  Whatever, recess today was uneventful. Went with desmond to the library. Met koganti there. He was apparently doing some last minute IvP work. The IvP people had their IvP fair rehearsal today.... Meanwhile, desmond and I just rushed through our hcl newspaper report. the cl class is like so slack.. (wishing i'm there..) they dont have much work compared to us. Yah. Luckily, we managed to finish it in time just before the recess bell rang. Made it back to class...  Then it was like hcl? we didnt do much. It was just another 1 hour of slacking. * please note: though the lesson was slack, the work for that subject definitely isnt!!!  science was sex ed again...  just talking about pregnancy, ovulation, etc... etc... dont wanna talk about it. but yah Yeow Boon the great asked a question: "Who did these people find out about all these????"  Ms Ho juz said... Well it started in England. They experimented on animals. What animals do you think are very common in England???   Well I said, "Meerkats!!!"  Ms Ho: "WHAT?????? whAT DID YOU Say? Meerkats are in africa lah the savannah..."  Leon: "Yah I know.. But they are also Meerkats in the UK! Like a few weeks ago when I was there I saw more than 10 at the wildlife-cum-theme park @ Chessington.  --  Jeremy Suddenly cuts in: "When you're good to mama..."  Laughter drowns his voice. The whole class, including Ms Ho was howling with laughter.... In case you dont know, Ms Ho's previous msn nickname was "meerkat". Now, it is "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you."  LOL...  Today was another interesting day...  -----------------------------------------------------------  Tomorrow is the history drama rehearsal!!! So worried about Victoria's performance... Other gep schools will be coming... ACS, RI, NYGH, DHS... blah. gonna see my friends.  well bye.

          Teachers can be interesting, weird, lame, or funny.  A science teacher who falls under these four categories(I won't state names, but she hates durians) had a peculiar msn display name.      "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you"     Yeah. I agree with Jeremy. There is also another Math teacher who falls under these four categories. (Again, I won't state names, but Yeow Boon's Mum said... "So cute! I want to pinch his [Mr Lai's] cheeks!") made a very peculiar statement.      "Science teachers are redundant, while Math teachers are SHORT and SWEET."  Another clue: That teacher drinks too much coffee.  Quote from someone else "Drinking coffee stunts your growth..."

       Hooray! Its sunday.  I had higher chinese enrichment this morning. One thing I like about it is that I get to meet friends from other schools every Sunday morning. Some of them are from GEP too! Some schools they are from: RI, ACSi, DHS, NYGH, CGSS (Cedar Girls), MSHS (Maris Stella) and CHS (Catholic High School; not THE Chinese High School. That's TCHS)  We had lots of fun today. (As usual) Lots of laughs and cheers. The teacher rocks. (he's from TCHS. lol)  Yeah.  I went to the St Francis Xavier church (the church i always go to). I went to the Multipurpose Centre for our usual Sunday mornings youth gathering (according to levels i.e. sec 1s, sec 2s, sec 3s, etc.) It was just as fun.   I think Sunday is social day. I met more friends from many other schools (some are the same as those above), plus plus.   I love Sundays :) ... The only downside to Sundays is that if I can't finish my work on Saturday, I'll have to do it today... :(  Haiz. Exactly. I'm busy working on my History Assignment : "The Isthmus of Kra"... Its due on the 16th of July (5 days to go...) Better hurry up..  That's all for today. (as of now)

       The legendary philosophy of the BABA.  BABA BLACK SHEEP DIDN'T LIKE HIS WOOL. IT WAS FRIZZY AND SO- NOT- COOL.  BABA BLACK SHEEP HAD A LOT OF WOOL. TIL HE CUT IT OFF AND GAVE IT ALL TO YOUUU.  BABA BLACK SHEEP DOESN'T LIKE HIS WOOOL. HE WANTS TO SHAVE IT OFF AND GIVE IT ALL TO YOU.  ------------------------------------------------ Baba is balding.  This may sound stupid, BUT IT HOLDS DEEP ECOLOGIST VIEWS WITHIN. BOYCOTT BLACK WOOL. we could give him a WHITE wool sweater though. and then he'd be baba the black and white sheep.

       Went to the VIP open house today. There was this talk by the Principal. I saw Mr James Koh (My Sec 1 English Teacher and 2004 GEP Subject Head) He was one of the Speakers, and is in the organising commitee for the Victoria Integrated Programme.  The presentation was one of those mr koh-mrs jay kind. You know those cool designs? (I could easily make them too...not boasting).Yah.  Though I sort of expected that some GEP teachers would be transferred to the VIP, I didnt expect to see Mrs Jay and Mr Lai too. They would be teaching Language Arts and Mathematics respectively. (so bizarre!!!)  At first, we were moving like a group of about 10 (class 2k!!!).. As we walked around, some strayed, leaving us with 7. This further reduced to groups of 3 and 4. in the end, these were our groupings:  1. Desmond and I 2. Lester, Sean and Yeow boon and Jeremy  3. James and Koganti. (first person to stray) 4. Jonathan was also somewhere. (3rd person to stray) 5. xue kai was with his band friends  Well there were many victorians (VS plus VJC people) there. There were also quite a lot of Dunmanians, CHIJ, TK, and people from all kinds of schools.  The preview sessions were quite okay. The lessons were just like a variant of our normal gep lessons. (anyway the Integrated Programme is focused on Gifted Education. IP is just an evolution of GEP.)But their lessons are interesting!  Marcus wasnt at VJC today. I wanted to ask him something about the VIP. He's in JC2. Nevermind.  Looks like I'll be applying for VIP... The admission test is on the 24th of July (in 2 Saturday's time)
