Favourite Actors & Actresses: Julia Roberts (all-time favorite), John Cleese, Sandra Bullock and Goldie Hawn.

If she was an elf, her name would be Gilraen Carnesir. If she was a hobbit, her name would be Pansy Loamsdown of Deephallow.

TV Interviews that she did in America are The Rosie O'Donnell Show, The Today Show, Live on Regis and Kelly, Oprah, Jay Leno, The Wayne Brady Show, The Early Show, The View, MTV TRL (Total Request Live) and The Caroline Rhea Show. Tom finds her, "very attractive and nice". But they're not going out. When Emma was asked if they were, she said: ''Ewww, no way!!" Her grandma's name is Freda Watson and is very close to Emma. When Emma was 4 she told her she either wanted to be a princess, a faerie(fairy in America), or an actress. So, her grandma thought she would be an actress. Which was a pretty good guess as it came true. Her First Interview was in August 2000 (Announcing Cast). She enjoys books by Roald Dahl, and she likes reading people's diaries, and of course, Harry Potter. You won't find her sitting down and reading that often, though. Her dad read her all the Harry Potter books. The first book her Father read to her is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Emma has never turned down a person who asked for her autograph. She might not do acting full time. As she said on Regis and Kelly, she does want to go to college. After the Harry Potter movies, she wants to play a high school American. "I want to play someone completely different so no one will ever guess that I played Hermione." She still loves Santa Claus. Emma's Christmas list is for more clothes. Her favourite lip gloss is Stila and she is almost always wearing lip gloss. Her favourite clothing brands are Deisel and Miss Sixty. Her 12th birthday was celebrated on the Chamber of Secrets set. The power went out while she was saying her lines and everyone caught on and thought that would be the perfect time to sing 'Happy Birthday'. "She seemed a bit embarrassed", says Chris Rankin (Percy). Emma went to Universal Studios with brother and dad in November 2002, after the Los Angeles Premiere. She had a vocal coach to perfect her Hermione lines in the first movie. Rupert and Dan make funny faces at her when she's shooting. Emmy calls herself very bossy. She keeps Dan and Rupert in line. She thinks getting recognized is pretty scary sometimes. She would never kiss any of the boys on set and is not dating any of them either. When she finished her first movie, her parents gave her a disco party for her and her friends. Her least favorite Chamber of Secrets scene was when she hugs Harry (Dan). "For starters, it was 'cringe', but then it was okay." Her invisibility cloak uses would be sneaking into movies or concerts. Emma hates vegetables, classical or opera music, math, Latin, geography, people saying she should date Dan or Rupert or teasing her, getting too much recognition, people coming up to her who aren't her friends and violence. She loves music, sports, talk shows, amusement parks, acting, singing, hanging out with friends, shopping, talking, listening to music, e-mails, and Hello Kitty merchandise. Her favourite catchphrase is "Dwarling!" Her cellphone is a Nokia 3330. Her Pet Peeve is "When radio stations interrupt the song before it's finished." On her dressing room door, she has a sign that says, BEWARE: BABE INSIDE. On filming the third movie, she claimed that it was the one Harry Potter movie where "all those lovely, lovely hormones start coming out". Emma Watson wrestles with the boys on the set, according to Jamie Waylett in his interview with The Leaky Cauldron.

      J.K. Rowling's sensational first book of the HARRY POTTER series had a great start. Soon, there were HARRY POTTER FANS all over the world. Her book was translated into many different languages and had great sales. The book earned enough money enabling her to write another and continue the story. Since then, HARRY POTTER has been known worldwide and was so famous that director Chris Colombus decided to make movies based on her books. These movies were a great success, including the latest, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN directed by new director, Alfonso Cuaron. The next movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, is due to release next year(2005). More updates on that story as soon as possible.
