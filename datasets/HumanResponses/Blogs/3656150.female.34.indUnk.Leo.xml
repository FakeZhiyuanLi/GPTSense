						   When we hear the examples of a rebellious heart many think, "Well if being a strong woman who stands up for her rights is being rebellious and somehow wrong, then call me a rebel!"  I fully understand that!  I too want to be recognized for being strong, intelligent, and not one who lies down to be a doormat.  God wants that too.  However the way we realize our strength looks nothing like they way it's been done in the past. How they told us to be heard was wrong. In the words of Malcom X "Ya been Hoodwinked!  Bamboozled!"  We can not fully realize our freedom by repressing men and saying we can do it better then them.  We can not do it by shaking our fists in anger and especially not by bitterly railing at the establishment. We simply can not sacrifice our souls for this freedom, yet that is exactly what has happened. Because we wanted the opportunity to be exactly like men, we have laid down our daughters and sons to be sacrificed in the name of our personal Freedom.  We too can cause a life to exist and then walk away from the responsibility of it if we so choose. We can be as sexually promiscuousis as men, having sex wherever and whenever we choose without worry of impugnity. We can raise a child without his father, because after all we really don't need a man in our life anyway right? And I'm fully aware of the fact that some women have no choice in the matter of raising their children on their own. Believe me the men are sacrificing their sons and daughters too!   Surprisingly I do see the established Church as part of the reason why things unfolded the way they did.  If the Church had been doing her job besides focusing on dictating moral standards for so long, women would not have felt the need to find validation in such a manner. If they had recognized the power of woman and made a place for her, we would not have had to scream to be heard and the results may well have been different.  Yet, in the end, it is not God or even the church behind our repression.  It is the same enemy who deceived us in the beginning, and hates us because it was out of woman that the Deliverer would be born.  He is who we should be raging against.  And it is his force to make woman feel shame that I will continue to do battle with.  Not the Church, not God, and not the  "Liberals" and Feminists of our time.

						   In today’s world, the woman who resists being told what to do, especially from a man who is in authority over her, is praised.  In fact she is placed on a pedestal and pointed to as one to be emulated.  Take for example that the cry that “no man can tell me how to live my life” is the loudest voice being heard in one of the most politically charged issues of today.  That, of course, being the abortion issue.   Most women who support abortion are appalled at the idea of killing their unborn, but they say they will not have anyone tell them that they cannot do as they choose.  “Keep your laws off my body” was the cry from Washington during this year’s “March for Women’s Lives” and it is the cry coming from the heart of women all over the United States.   To modern ears, still ringing with the echoes of the ERA and Feminist movement of the ‘60’s, this sounds reasonable. However, to base this one stance as the most important issue concerning women’s lives is not only unreasonable but also hypocritical in my opinion.  It is unreasonable because a woman’s life encompasses so much more than the right to have an abortion. Hypocritical because while saying they are opposed to those who would make laws that take away the choices of women, they are taking away the choice of their unborn daughters. In addition I cannot understand why the pro-life stance is considered taking away woman’s’ rights, yet it is not taking away rights to convict a women of murder for killing the children after they have been birthed.  Illogical thought processes and finger pointing to rationalize positions is a clear indication of a defiant heart.  Next: "Call me a Rebel!"

						   If you are visiting...be warned I am in the most politically incorrect belief system there is to be in right now.  I'm a Christian, and my views will always be based on that foundation.  What's been on my mind here of late is what I've titled "The Battle for The Hearts of Women".  It is a battle that has been fought since almost the beginning and will continue till we finish our time here on earth.    When talking with women today, specifically the “un-churched”, I have found that many have a disdain for the God of the Bible.  They feel He is vindictive, harsh, and the most damning for them, “Patriarchal”.  It has become my passion to understand why this view has come about, and to discover what the truth is.  What does the God of the Bible feel towards women, specifically women in positions of authority?  On the outset, I will have to say this: Do I personally believe that women should be subservient to men so as to be seen and not heard, and not involved in leadership?  Absolutely not, in fact just the opposite.  But to get us to be able to handle that responsibility with the kind of care God deserves us to show as representatives of Him, we most work through divided heart issues.  Within the Soul of every woman there beats two hearts.  There is one who longs to be in harmony with her Creator through obedience and one who wants to forge her own path.  We are born with both hearts, but until we came to know Christ and his transforming power we will always follow the one who believes she knows best.  One is a heart of love, the other, rebellion.    There are many forces at work to direct which heart will ultimately gain control. Especially strong, is the force that would most want the rebellious heart to be in control.  We can see that even when the heart of rebellion is defeated and the obedient one is finally beating stronger, the unruly heart is still struggling to gain admittance. It is the struggle of the ages.  Never the less, it is possible to have a life with the obedient heart at the helm.  More to come...
