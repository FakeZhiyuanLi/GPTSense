      Can I just say that I love LaunchCast Radio? I just discovered it today (thanks to neemie). You get to design your own radio station. I've gotten everything from Loreena McKennitt to Rascal Flats to A Perfect Circle all in the last half hour. I'm so damned pleased. I'll write about the invasion of the fake flowers after work...

      Yah, I know. I'm not even updating in here. I suck, but now I have an interesting story. I was apartment hunting this weekend and I drive into this place and my first thought was, "Wow, this really doesn't look like the ad. I hope my car doesn't break down." So, I park and find the place they claim is an office. It's actually an apartment. I felt like I was walking into someone's home. The first thing I noticed was the smell. Then I saw two people sitting at a table in the kitchen. I said, "Hi! I'm looking for the leasing agent." They're both like, "Uh, I think he's upstairs." So, I start up the stairs repeating my call of, "Hello...Looking for the leasing agent." I'm sure I sounded a bit trepidacious. Then a voice calls down, "Yeah, yeah...I'll be down in a minute. Have a seat." So, I go sit on a smelly couch in the smelly living room to wait. Then, I start hearing noises. At first I'm like "Cat? Baby? Hmmmm...What's that sound?" Then, the moaning began. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not exactly prudish or anything, but you just don't screw someone (loudly I might add) in your office, during business hours, when there are THREE people sitting not 50 feet down the stairs. On top of the sketchy neighborhood and the smell, there was no way in the hell I was moving into that complex. I got up, smiled at the other two people, and walked out the door. When I got back to the car, I marked off that complex, any complex owned by the same company, and the two adjacent properties for good measure. Then, I went and comforted myself with some Key Lime Pie Ice Cream at Bruster's.   Fin...

      So, I'm at work again and all I have left to do is work on the project that I really, really, really don't want to do. Therefore, I'm stalling. I mean, really, who wants to go through 27 cds worth of pictures, match them to the originals (which I scanned), measure the originals (which are really to delicate to handle much less take out of their little sleeves and slap about with a wooden ruler), find the correct file in the database (which I created and is, at least, easy to sift through), enter the data, and repeat upwards of a 100 times. I understood why I needed all of the other data, but this just seems erroneous considering how the pictures are going to be used. I hate busy work. The thing is, my bosses don't seem to realize that it is busy work. As much as I love this job and don't want to leave it, now that I realize that I only have a couple of weeks left until the grant money goes kaput and I have to leave; I just want it to be over already. Let me look for a new job and move on.

      Rawr. I'm here, I'm upright, and I'm annoying my collegues. I feel better today, but I'm a one girl band at this point. It's a constant cycle of raspy cough, sneeze, rustle for tissue, snort, gaggy cough, sniffle, sniffle, sneeze. I'm sure it's a lovely symphonic melody for my fellow library cublicle drones. I actually feel a little bad about disturbing the utter silence and peaceful quiet, but *blah* I have to work to get paid. Fortunatly, I'm off at 5:15. Then I'll go meet mom and drag her to the salon. After, they're through cutting it; I get to dye it this evening. Muahahaha. My mother is actually letting me dye her head. My stylist aunt is too busy to do her hair these days. Actually, I'm good at the whole hair dying thing. I've been doing mine on and off since I was sixteen and we're not going to even discuss the point in time when the girls in my dorm realized I wouldn't make them look like a 5 year old's experiment with their first barbie. I swear, I should've been charging with the amount of hair I was dyeing in any given week. But I stil get to tease mom about the possibility of her ending up with pink hair. Muahahahaha...*eg*

      I just found this in one of the annotations I was editing and thought it was beautiful,  "On the occasions of his 74th birthday, he concludes: “Yes, if the evening is to be as the morning was, let it come. Then, when the sun goes down, and night hangs out her sable curtains, and the song of the catbird dies away in the hawthorn, I will rest my head on my mother’s knee, wsay my prayers, and sweetly fall asleep” (p 242)."

      I've figured out the way to keep from falling over today is to drink all the water I can and take mini naps after each set of file entries. So glad I can nap in the privacy of the cubicle even if the desk is hard and the chair causes me to sit with unnaturally good posture. Ow, sniffle, whine, cough. I'm seriously worried about driving home today. I'm on a combo of Dayquil and Advil Cold and Sinus. I don't feel very non-drowsy, as a matter of fact, I'm leaning toward hallucinating.

      So, one of the chicas I read over at diary-x has started a blogspot blog thing. I've decided I'm going to save that for longer, more complicated posts. With my life being so insane right now, I needed something quick and painless. A lot of the stuff I post there is well...complicated and not anything I'd want my close, personal friends to read or anything I'd want a number of other people to read. It also takes a lot of time to force that kind of crap out. I've went weeks and months without a post there because I've set it up as a place to purge. So, now, I have this nice friendlier place to post. It even has a spell check! Whee! I'm not saying I won't be honest and if bad shit is happening to me I'm gonna talk about it. However, if you want deep and probing; try my d-x account. If you really want it (heck if you didn't start out reading me there), I'm likely to give you the address unless you happen to know me IRL. Off to play with the new toy!
