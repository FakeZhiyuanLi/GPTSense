       I don't really have anything to blog about today.  So, I thought I'd try to see how putting pictures in these things works.  Here is my dog:

      I figured out why I love dogs so much today.  I had to be gone today for much longer than I originally thought I would need to be.  Consequently, my dog was left in her crate for about 10 hours.  Needless to say, because I'm a big baby, I worried about her.  Well, when I came home, she was fine, and she was ridiculously happy to see me.  That's why I love dogs.  She wasn't pissed off at me for leaving her alone all day, she wasn't mad for being locked up.  No, she was just happy that I was home.  They are always just happy for the time they get to spend with you and for the love that you give them.  While growing up, I had a few dogs.  I was going to write about Chance, who died a year ago.   And about Charlotte, who left us last week.  I find the idea of writing about them makes me sad.  I don't want to be sad, and I know for sure they wouldn't want me to be.  So, for now, I won't write of them.  Instead I will pet the puppy in my lap and tell her I love her.  She makes me so happy.

      I think a well written book can be amazing.  I like it when an author can make the characters so real that I find myself being happy with them, getting angry with them, or feeling 'real' emotions.  As if these characters were not just words on a page.  While reading a book recently, I found myself so angry with an event that happened and the way a particular character acted, that I had to put the book down and step back from it for a bit.  It was so real, it was actually able to evoke a strong emotional reaction.  That's good writing.  Because I enjoy reading so much, I have naturally thought of writing many times.  I always find excuses not to do it (until this blog, and that's if you consider this 'writing').  My typical excuses are along the lines of lack of time, creativity, or some other intangible thing.  I think perhaps the biggest thing holding my back is that I've read some incredible writing.  When I read these authors, I find myself thinking, "There's no way I could write like this".  I lack the descriptive skills, the vocabulary, the...craft.  Now, this may or may not be true, but I seem to have done a nice job convincing myself of it.  My best friend, a self-proclaimed author, tells me that I just need to write.  I just need to make the time to write.  Write short stories, novels, scenes, whatever...just write.   He's right, he's gotta be.  I'm sure the authors whom I adore didn't write their great works the first time they sat down and put the pen-to-paper, or fingers-to-keys as the case may be.  Writing, I assume, like everything else in life, takes practice to make better.  Maybe I should start practicing...maybe that's why I'm doing this.

      I shaved off my moustache and goatee today.  I've had them for over 5 years now.  I look weird, I don't recognize myself in the mirror at a glance.  I think I won't grow it back though, I kind of like having a smooth face.  It will just take some time to get used to.  It will be interesting to see everyones reaction tomorrow at school.   There was a Monk marathon on tv today.  I kind of like that show, it's not something I could ever see myself recording, but every time I seem to channel surf my way to it, I end up sitting there and watching the whole thing.   Guess that's it for today, pretty uneventful.  I'll try to start thinking a deep thought or two to put on this thing.  :P

      So the Olympics are on.  It drives me nuts that only one network gets to cover the games.  Give me a freaking break.  So, if you're like me, and you only have one of the seven NBC channel's broadcasting the games, then you have to watch the crap they want you to watch and miss out on any of the potentially cool events.  For example.  Today, they spent a freaking hour of coverage on Synchronized Diving.  Synchronized diving?  What the hell is that crap?  Not only should it not even be an Olympic sport, but the USA team didn't even qualify!  Why waste an hour of coverage on that?  Ugh!  I want to see Fencing, or Judo, or other cool stuff that you don't get to see all the time.  Instead I'll be stuck watching Michael Phelps, or two chinese girls jumping off a diving board at the same time, or even worse...basketball.  Yes, let's give Olympic basketball all kinds of coverage, it's not like we EVER have the chance to watch basketball any other time.  Back to my original point, at least if all the networks got to cover the games, then we could at least *choose* the games we wanted to watch.  Let one of them networks bid for priority or something and they can show all the finals or have first choice on what they cover.  Then let the other networks cover the other stuff that everyone else wants to see.   Okay, enough of that.

      Got my window fixed today, that was good.  Karate Kid 2 came on tv today, I watched most of it.  Man that's pathetic.   We went and got some Cuervo from the drug store and some margarita mix from Williams-Sonoma tonight.  Good stuff.  Will have to partake more tomorrow night.  I seem to be writing in short, incomplete sentences tonight.  If there is an explanation for this, it's beyond me.  I am very tired though, but I'm always tired this time at night.  I guess getting up at 6 or 6:30 every morning will do that to you.   My knee has been hurting worse each day for the last few days.  Today it progressed to the point that I had to limp through most of our evening walk.  I'm no doctor, but I don't think that's a good sign.  Hopefully if I do nothing different, keep walking a couple miles on it every night, and proceed with life as usual it will get better on its own.  If not, school starts in a week and a half and then I can go see a doctor for free again.  Won't that be nice.  What a crappy blog.  I should be posting my thoughts on life, the universe, or even everything.  Alas, maybe later.

      So today I had to take a movie back to the video store and a book back to the library. I gathered up my stuff, put the dog in her cage, told her to watch the place while I was gone, and headed out to the car. I got in the car, fired that baby up, and thought to myself, "Is there a window open?". I glaned in the back seat to check the rear windows. Well, while all the windows were in their upright and locked positions, the rear windshield was no longer where one might typically find a rear windshield. Instead it was in small pieces all over the back seat of my car. I had been outside about two hours prior to then, and the windshield was definitely intact and inplace at that time. My car is parked right outside my apartment, and due to the wonderful weather we have here, the windows were all open. Wouldn't you think I would have heard something (someone?) hitting and shattering my rear windshield into a bazillion pieces? Yeah, me too. Thankfully, the thousands of dollars we pay in insurance every year will actually do some good. The nice people from some local glass shop will be out in the morning to make everything all better. Isn't that nice.  I watched the Butterfly Effect today. Throughout the movie I kept thinking how messed up it was, then they had to go and give it a happy ending. Just didn't feel right. For the most part I enjoyed it though. Better than I expected considering it had Ashton Kutcher in it.  Some bitch let her dog take a crap in front of our apartment and didn't clean it up today. Next time she does it I think I'll figure out which apartment she lives in and start delivering my dog's poop to her doorstep. I bet she would appreciate that.  That is all.
