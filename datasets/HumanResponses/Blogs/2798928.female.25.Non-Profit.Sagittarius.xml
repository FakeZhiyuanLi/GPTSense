      I am writing this as my head recovers from the fog that fills it... Yesterday I met Marshall and Travis in Boone.  Couple that with the former Model UN crew and especially Renee = an evening full of imbibing and debauchery.  Tequila shots and cosmopolitans were overflowing.  Talking, flirting, and drunkeness ensued.  All in all, a very jolly good time.   Today, however, a hangover occurred.  Pounding head, inability to enunciate, etc. This was partially remedied by a greasy breakfast and fresh air on the parkway. Go LOST IN TRANSLATION, WHALE RIDER, RETURN OF THE KING AND CITY OF GOD! Academy Awards are tonight...  This e-mail will be cut short due to my dead brain.    Countdown to Sopranos: 1 week Countdown to Senegal: 14 days  www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com

      Alrighty then.... It's another Must See TV Thursday (only 3 Must See TVs left - then it will be Must See Millet Pounding and barefoot soccer - much more interesting). How many countdowns could I make up?  The best is only 6 more days where I will have to accept any sub job that comes my way and then two weeks of getting prepared and only subbing if I want to!  YAY!  No more little shit heads to deal with (pardon the harsh language, but it was very necessary for the evil that lurks in high school).   I fly out of Charlotte to Philly at 8:50 in the AM and arrive in Philly at 10:25 in the AM!  WOO HOO!  It feels more real now.  Marielsie, one of my new found kick-arse PC Senegal pals, will land in Philly from NJ about an hour before me.  She is going to be a dear and wait for me, then we'll have some almuerzo, uh, no, dammit, what is lunch in French?  Anyway, you get the idea. This weekend is devoted to Katie Sparks - bridal shower Sat and Sex and the City Finale (tear) Sunday.  It shall be super fabulous because she is super fabulous. The next weekend will be the best weekend before I go away (I'm getting verklempt just thinking about it).  My boyfriends (in the most non-sexual sense possible) are coming to Boone, NC for a weekend of being "fabulous and frivalous" (to quote the diamond earringed guy in 30degrees who bought me Moet-Chandon).  Imagine if Boone were Hispanola: where ever we are will be Dominican Republic and the rest of Boone will be Haiti.   We will down the Patron, party with THE awesome Renee and other fabulous Boone/ASU people.  And then I will probably have a cry and have a drive home and all will be right. Let's see - the weekend after that it's either off to the Dominican Republic (fingers crossed) OR to Chapel Hill to sell Amanda Brown my car.  While I love Amanda Brown, I would really like to go to DR.  But seeing A. Brown is not a bad alternative. :-D Then the next and last weekend will be a party like it's 1999 thrown by Zaneta.  Too much fun, food and drink I'm sure.   Alas, too much writing for thise posting.

      Tonight was the second to last episode of Sex and the City EVER!  I cried through the entire episode (almost).  I completely identify with Carrie.  She left her hometown and her best friends for a city where she doesn't speak the language and she can't figure out where she belongs in the grand scheme of things.   There are 29 days left in my countdown.  Until this past week, I could hardly contain my excitement about leaving for Senegal, but now I'm starting to miss people and I haven't even left.  Of the negative emotions, I'm not nervous.  I'm not scared.  I'm more sad than anything.  I wish my friends and family could have this experience with me, but I guess that's what this blog is for, isn't it? Vive le Sex and the City!  We will miss you Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha and all the men in between!

      The frustrating countdown is still on.....  34 days and freakin' slowly counting... I've met a few others who are on there way.  They seem pretty cool so far, but we'll see.  I know at some point they will eventually piss me off and I'll piss them off, but then we'll enjoy a Gazelle and a few laughs and life will be good again. :-) This past weekend I went to DC for a fabulous going away weekend.  Friday was a fun filled night - starting with happy hour at 5:30 and ending with me going to Camille's at 11!  Mango tango tinis were making the rounds at Helix as were shots and other delights.  Tres manifique!   Saturday was a lovely lounging day with Erica.  Smoothies to ease our hangover blahs.  Whole Foods adventure for the par-tay and then some cafe for some energey.   The party was just great.  A few key people were missing, but half of them are around the world, so I guess that's a pretty good excuse.  I ate my weight in brie and pesto on a baguette and then there was the orgasmic chocolate cake.  I figured I would not be getting brie and pesto in Senegal (my lame-o excuse to eat all the fromage I can until departure date). It was then time on Sunday for my trip back to dull as dish water NC.  I broke down and boo hooed in the car, already nostalgic for the friends that I had just left.  To top the wonderful weekend off, I watched the third to last episode of Sex and the City EVAH!!!!   I'm anxiously waiting for Katie Sparks' Sex and the City series finale party at her house.   Time to practice French.

      My first "blog" entry.....  I don't leave until the 13th of March for staging and then the 15th for Senegal.  Until then, my posting to this will be kept to a minimum, but my thoughts, fears, anticipation and stressors may pop up from time to time.  Vamos a ver... maybe I should start writing random things in French though...hmmm

      3 down, 37 to go.  3 people have already quit and we have only been at this for 2 weeks!  Things here aren't depressing or desperate.  But it is emotionally taxing and things aren't always as they seem.  This blog may be short... I'm short on time.... Well, so goes culture shock, so goes my emotions.  The past two days I've been so happy and excited to be here.  Weird how that can change in a moment. If people want to send stuff, include magazines or photos of 50 cent and eminem and any other hip hop people. My host family LOVES american hip hop. Pulaar is a painful language to learn.   I still miss ice cream, but allegedly you can get EVERYTHING in Dakar. So I'm just waiting until Peace Corps lets go of my freakin' hand and we can go to Dakar on our own. As far as the Roger Clemmens brother rumor - NOT TRUE.   Another funny thing - I told my host family what my parents do.  My oldest brother in the Fam is 24.  Miraculously, his life dream is to move to the US and work in a grocery store.  Isn't that such a coincidence that 2 of my four parents work in the grocery business?? hmmm.... no marraige visa for him! Ok, time to go back to the mind-numbing training. Only a few short months and we are off to our posts, ready to sweat out arses off! Thanks for the cards MOM and NANA!!! You guys are great! They arrive in 5-8 days.

      Ah the first blog entry from Senegal.  Tell the masses. I'm sort of homesick today and I'm thinking it's a combination of Larium, PMS and the host family.  Host family is fab, but SO DIFFERENT than any host family I've ever head.  They have a pet goat though - attention KT Sparks! But it's tethered to a tree, so I'm scared he may be food soon.  I don't think I'll make friends with him because I don't eat my friends.  The following will be my random observations about Senegal.  The people in the villages are genuinely happy, so why am I here? To point out what they don't have and why their lives aren't up to par by Western standards, which will make them unhappy?  Speaking of Western Standards, I could sure go for some cheese, a shower not in the form of a bucket bath, and a Cosmopolitan, but not in that order. They have cheese in Dakar, but I think it's out of the PCV price range.  But the rumor is they have Laughing Cow at the Super Marche here. The beer is Flag. It's cool sometimes, but definitely not cold. Breasts are everywhere in the villages and even some places in my current metropolis of Thies (pronounced Chezz).  They aren't considered a sex object here and it's no wonder - they look like gigantic raisins flattened by a steam roller. Moral of the story - don't have 10 kids, breast feed them all and always wear a bra!   But holy heck - the knees!!! Now if you show your knees at all, that means you are looking for some loving!!! Knees are scandalous - unless you want rumors of you working a la Pretty Woman style, keep them covered. My host family's kids listen to american hip hop and watch Brazilian soap operas dubbed in French.  That's proved interesting in their perception of America and Brazil.  The women do ALL the house work.  It's a little depressing that they usually don't aspire to be more than a housewife.  Only the boys usually go to university, unless you family is from Dakar.   We westerners really like our "stuff".  I brought more stuff than my host family has in their sort of large house. There is nothing on the walls.  They have some chairs.  A TV. A phone.  And beds.  With springy matresses and lumpy pillows.    It's amazing how much the laugh.  They live communally.  No one can really save money for themselves because they are expected to give any extra money to their family. They are more altruistic than I am(but that's not very difficult). Training is dull as dishwater. I'm ready to get to my village so I can have some freedom.  Pulaar and french combo really hurt my brain.  The babies are adorable.  But there are so many kids!!!  Good gawd.   I showed my host dad his NC Book and he called the Civil War the "War of Succession"!!! He's an honorary southerner in my book! Ok, I need to run so my host family doesn't call out the national guard.  I'm  running late.  ps-stomache and intestines are still happy. :-D  www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Amanda is the proud owner of a well groomed 1994 Honda Accord EX (that had a Howard Dean sticker on it back in the day).  The best part of the day was seeing Amanda and her hermana in Chapel Hill, where we dropped the goods.    As time draws near, I shed some tears.  Tear. Sniff.  Last night my tae kwon do Master, Master Kim, gave me a new dobok to take to Senegal with me! It was so moving!  He said I would make a good instructor some day and they look forward to me returning.  Hopefully I will have time and can find a place in Senegal to do Tae Kwon DO.  Sweetie, dahling, I had a spa experience fit for a queen this past week.  Tres manifique.  Then more crappy shopping for the damn adventure.  It's draining the U2 groupie funds I tell you!  The internet rumor has it that they are going to release their new album this October or November (say Ma, all I want for my birthday is this CD express mailed!).  Then touring in February.  So......  this sounds really terrible, but when it comes to U2, I'm really really selfish.  If they are on tour when I'm supposed to go to Cape Verde, tough.  If they are on tour when I'm supposed to go to Europe to visit the rents, double tough.  Where ever Bono is is where I shall be.  I'm happiest while at a U2 concert.  "But Kelly, your priorities are out of whack!"  Yep.  I know, but such is life.   Damn, I really need to practice my French. Only a few short days until I'll have to use it (when Spanish will inevitably surface when I don't know the french word).  www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Today was a two for one double hottie feature! I saw Starsky and Hutch - Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.  I've haven't seen this much hotness on screen since Zoolander....uh...oh.  Yeah, they were both in that too.  Anyway, it was funny, in bad taste, and all around a really good time! Have you noticed, though, how crooked nose hottie, Owen Wilson, plays the same character in every movie?   I only have one more Sunday of amazing HBO TV, which is better than must see Thursday (except Will and Grace, oh and the Apprentice - "YOUR FIRED." - Friends is just dull and has gone down hill; what a cop out with those "your six favorite episodes of all time - BLECH).  I got a tiny taste of the Sopranos before I'm cut off like Ralphi Ciffareto's head last season.   I just found out today that my friend went on a date with Doogie Howser, not MD.  Not Niel Patrick Harris, but a guy who graduated from COLLEGE WHEN HE WAS 18!!!!  It was funny that we talked about this on IM today because Vinnie, Doogie's next door neighbor, is a new young mafioso in Tony's family!  He made an appearance on the Sorpanos tonight.  Coincidence? I think not.  What ever the hell it means, I'm not sure.  But it's still freaky that Ben and I were talking about Doogie Howser today and Vinnie was on the Sopranos.  Tomorrow I am off to the Grove Park Inn for 3 days of spa treatment, R&R, tappas, best friends, old friends and mountain air. Bisou Bisou. ps - I think these entries will become much more interesting two weeks form now...........   www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Please do not take me to Costco upon my return to the US.  It's CRAZY IN THERE!  I feel like Kramer in that episode of Seinfeld where he can't help but buy a million 1 gallon cans of beef-a-rino.  I now have a two year supply of batteries, vitamins, shampoo, etc. And to boot, I bought the kids in my host family and village a 5 POUND BAG OF JOLLY RANCHERS!  I only did it because I've heard hard candy is a hit in Senegal like everywhere else.  Rock on - I'm going to Senegal to spread cavities!  Luckily I also now I have life time supply of toothebrushes to pass out with the jolly ranchers. Yin and Yang Besides my aficionado for Bill Murray, I've also grown to love love love Bill Maher.  Sigh.  I'm going to really miss spending some Friday evenings with him.  He's hot for a political commentator - well maybe not hot in the James Carville alien-from-Louisiana way, and maybe not hot in the Al Franken witty-self-deprecating-Jew way, but he's definitely hotter than Bill O'Reilly, ugly in the splotchy-face-megalomaniac-psycho way.

       A Rant  Do you know that you cannot get CFAs, the currency of about 9 West African countries, from Bank of America in Charlotte? Bastards.  Now I have to get a few travellers checks.  What a pain in the arse.  Ah well, I shouldn't sweat that.  The first and most insignificant of the hurdles I will face.    How much longer can I procrastinate packing? It's so easy, but yet my stuff is still strewn about my room and has made no progress into a suitcase.    It is official.  I AM NO LONGER A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER! No decent human being should ever be put through that hell.  Indecent human beings should have to though.  I think certain officer holders should try being a substitute.  Then they would really get a feel for what's wrong with this country.  It's not gay marriage, or the fact that we don't have a colony on Mars.  It's the materialistic consumption culture that has enveloped this country.  Many high schoolers epitomize this.  They need to see it for themselves. They need to hear high school students, talk about thier bling bling, pimps, hoes, mommy and daddy paying for it all, lesbian sex, anal sex, every kind of sex, SUVs, ask where the country of Paris is, ask what a primary is, what the electoral college is, ask why if Shakespeare is so great then why doesn't he publish anymore, etc.  And people think I'm crazy for going into the Peace Corps!

      "All things just keep getting better! Oooh, Oooh!".  I'll miss that glorious song that wakes me up at 10pm after dull dreary Tuesdays.  Unlike American Idol and Big Brother, which have spawned demon offspring all over this globe (that was not our fault though - we have to UK to blame for originating those shows), I highly doubt there will be a Queer Eye for the Wolof Speaking Guy, or better yet, Queer Eye for the Dashiki Wearing Guy.   Let's see - I'll miss three other shows, all on HBO - so the DVDs will be waiting for me when I return home: The Sopranos, Bill Maher (he rocks my world!) and Six Feet Under. John Edwards dropped out of the race.  While my heart really wants a feels that John Kerry will beat W, the part of me that has worked on the Southern campaign trail on many random campaigns in NC (President to US Senator to NC Senator) knows that a "yankee" will have a hard time getting those ignorant Southern votes!  Wake up Southerners! Stop growing tobacco and start growing a brain!  Just because you are a white male, doesn't mean you will be rich!  You are more likely to file bankruptcy than become a 6 figure income earner! Deal with it. Money isn't everything. VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE - NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOUR INCOME BRACKET SHOULD BE!

       OSCAR RE-CAP   The Oscars were last night and I watched it via DVR (like TIVO).  So I missed all the boring acceptance speeches... Quite possibly the most boring and predictable Oscar ceremony in years. Can I say I was quite upset that Bill Murray did not win for Lost in Translation?  Well Bill, if somehow you get your hands on my lovely blog, let this be known:  I thought your were robbed, dammit! Robbed I say!  Your moving performance was tres manifique and you are hot for an older pock-marked man! If I were Charlotte Johanssen, things would have ended differently on that movie set.  Way better looking that Edward James Olmos and a hell of alot hotter than that freaky Madonna-marrying stoner from Fast Times At Ridgemont High.  That's all I really want to say today, unless you guys want to hear about my adventures in buying new birkentstocks and trying to get some CFAs (the currency of approximately 9 West African countries) before I leave.    www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Two for the price of one in blogland today.  So I forgot to mention one very important detail.  Yesterday, we, the PCVs witnessed Senegalese wrestling, which rivals WWF (not the panda) in popularity.  Beautiful sculpted Senegalese males came to the center to show us the wonders of the body, I mean, the sport of wrestling.  they strip down to a cloth that is tied around them like a diaper.  who ever can throw their opponent to the ground first wins.  and they say homosexuality is illegal in senegal.......  A commentary on TV-people in senegal that own a TV rival americans in TV consumption.  they are glued to the tube.  most of the images are from america, brazil and india.  so just like americans think africa is full of starving distended bellied children with flies swarming everywhere; senegalese think all americans are super rich and quite promiscuious and that our president is an idiot, which i caannot dispute.  the iraq images are way more graphic here than i know what you all are getting in the states.  congrats to the newly engaged!!!! rachel to douglas and zaneta to ryan!  please, some one still be single in two years.  i know my dc people will be. now i need to go to the bon marche (the toubab store - toubab is wolof for white)for my saturday double chocolate magnum bar.

      Last weekend was quite the fabulous weekend followed by the fabulous week.  We went to a georgeous beach that is only 45 minutes from the training center called Toubab Diallo.  We were practically the only people there and stayed in a place that was appropriately titled tolkeinesque by lonely planet.  Gardens and sun overran the place.  It rocked. Then, low and behold, in one day I received 3 packages!!!!!  KT, Z and my Dad and Lisa rocked my world!  Thanks for the Source Magazine Z. The fam (my siblings) loved it. Speaking of, my family loves 50 cent.  They asked me in french What does Mother F!!!ing PIMP mean.  How do you answer that?  The only thing I could think of was the wolof word for flirt/pimp: si si or calibante.  they died laughing. fun times. The PC Training center has ended up being the kitty rescue shelter.  This week I rescued two cats, both with gunk on their eyes.  The first one ran away with my friend's kitty.  I gave the second away.  You have to understand the kitties are considered to be on the same level as rats here, and dogs are even more despised!!!!  we were chasing our language trainer, amadu, around the center with the little kitty. he is petrified of cats.  good times.  it does not take much to entertain us here in senegal. my pulaar is progressing.  i can now say that i speak conversational pulaar. that does not mean i can understand though.  in the news of the fabulous, i found out that the harry potter movies come to dakar!  yes it will be eight months after the release in the US, but still!!!!!! and that once we become PCVs (three weeks) we have access to the american club.  for free.  so my poor pcv self can hob nob with embassy staff by a nice clean pool.  ina moyyi!!!  pulaar for cool! i find out my site next week.  finally. i am rocking out with my french press so please send me coffee (ground bold from starbucks) if you feel like it.  and if any of you see mike u in arizona, tell him he knows what to buy people. oh yeah, do not send me any packages from april 26 on and no letters after may 6.  once i find out my site i will let you know.   www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      so i just found out about a new brewing controversy here in senegal. the marabouts, islamic religious leaders that are only typical to senegal, have issues with the senegalese desire to dance (and can they dance! i am the whitest white girl on the face of the earth!) and islam.  they want dancing to to outlawed in public and think youssou ndoor promotes wantoness behavior by introducing cool dance moves. sounds like a remake of a little movie called footloose. the fromage is back in my life, but in a different way.  you know there is a problem with the language i am learning when there is no word for cheese! they just say fromage.  they don,t eat much cheese though, so i guess there is no use for the word.  but i really should not worry about not eating cheese because since my violent illness a few weeks ago; i have had the opposite problem.  no fun with the squat toilettes.  i will have quads of steel in two years time. 6 people are now gone....  all for very different reasons. thanks mom for the easter package and thank you kelly H for the nice card! always thoughtful.... thanks cathey D for the cute easter card! i am going to the beach this weekend for a much needed break. you guys are all fabulous and i hope to hear from all of you, even if i do not directly respond. no time on this dumb machine www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      I will get to the title in a bit. This weekend was Independence Day - April 4th, 04 and they were celebrating 44 years!  4-4-4-44.  All the big festivities were held in Thies this year, so naturally, our city was a frenzy of action.  Youssou Ndour played a free concert, which is not so good for us Americans who are used to our space and people driving with regard for human life. The music was great though. I learned that my white arse REALLY can't dance!  My host family laughs at me when I try to dance like them.  But at least I try.  They encourage me to dance anyway.   The president of Senegal is a little wacky.  He was democratically elected, but probably won't maintain these principals.  He doesn't think Senegal needs to have elections the next cycle because there is a liberal parliament and he is conservative.  He also had thousands of t-shirts printed up for independence day with his face on them.  Someone could have a touch of megalomania. I would also like to mention the tea ritual they practice here.  It's wonderful.  2-3 times a day, they slurp three tinyglasses of tea really fast. the first one is strong with sugar.  the second one has more sugar and mint added. the third glass has tons of sugar, a little tea and no mint.  usually a boy in the family makes the tea.  if a boy isn't available, the father makes it.  and i guess if there are no men, no one has tea! it is quite elaborate and takes about an hour to have all three glasses.  they pour it in a way that makes froth.  that's about the only thing men do here. the women do housework all day everyday. anyway...  i had a crazy larium dream the other night - i dreamt that bill maher was having a political forum with wives of polygamists.  but the wives all looked like sorority girls and they were debating israel and palestine.   hmm...speaking of, i felt like an israeli soldier the other day.  on my way home from school, three kids followed me and threw rocks at me!!! the little freaks!  so i ran home and told my host brothers and they ran outside after them to throw rocks back.    oh yeah, back to the damning of the fromage (cheese in french). so i went to a Toubab (white person) restaurant last wednesday.  i ordered this amazing lasagna.  it tasted great, but in the middle of it i started feeling not so hot, so i couldn't finish.  later that night i was violently ill, and i mean violent for about 7 hours.  i thought it was the fromage, and i was damning the fromage.  but then i thought back to a nasty piece of meat i took a bite of the night before.... training is still abismal. 8-6 monday through friday and 8-12 on saturday.  half of it is language training and the other half is worthless crap.  that's my assesment. i bought a cell phone! if you have the urge to call senegal with a calling card, e-mail me and i'll send you the digits. KT Sparks - I received your card and photos in only 7 days! you Rock my world!  That's all for now....still getting used to senegalese culture. at least the food is better - my host mom is the best cook.  www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      My first dull-as-dishwater posting since returning from Senegal.  Yee haw.  Let's have a go at it, shall we? Senegal is a much safer place than the US for a million and one reasons.  First of all, not many people know where it is, so that greatly reduces the risk of a terrorist attack. Second, unless you are from Mauritania, I doubt Senegal has ever pissed you off. Third, it is virtually impossible to get a gun in the country. People don't hunt with guns.  I think like one person in Dakar may have a gun. In a museum. Third, its too hot to do much of anything too physical, like get in a fight.  So while I do cherish being back in the US, I miss the security I felt in Senegal. Sure, I was herassed, but that was mild and never felt in danger. Just random thoughts on that.... FOUR JOB INTERVIEWS IN DC NEXT WEEK...  Count them.  1-2-3-4. Four.  That's pretty exciting. I'm sure if I get one of them, I'll probably be over worked and under paid and will need a second job at one of the 565,780 Starbucks in the DC area.  I'll be in DC though.  My true love.  Sure, I'll have an affair with Paris every now and then, and once in awhile I'll make out with NYC. Heck, I've even been on a few bad dates with Charlotte and Phoenix.

      Ok, So ET means early termination in Peace Corps lingo, which is what I am in the process of doing right now.  Amanda B, give my car back. HAHA, kidding.  Now, here is the quiz: Am I ETing because: a.) If I am called toubab one more time I may go postal b.) If I am asked if I have a husband one more time I may go postal c.) I ran out of my ground starbucks coffee and have to resort to the only coffee sold in the developing world: Nescafe  or  d.) none of the above, seek better answer The answer is D. That's right.  I'm coming home. I think I'll be home Thursday morning because my flight leaves on Wednesday night (not sure of the flight info mom, but I'll call you using the handy dandy calling card from Harris Teeter cuz I sold the cell phone). Ok, to clear some stuff:  first and foremost, I LOVE SENEGAL. LOVE LOVE LOVE SENEGAL.  sure, some things were annoying, but that was to be expected.  Second I LOVE LOVE LOVE the friends I made in training (stage).  They are truely amazing and I plan to hold true to my promise of visiting Senegal and Cape Verde for Carnivale in February (because I love them - My peeps Heather and Kath will be getting some cool stuff very soon).  I love love love my host family and sobbed buckets when I told them I was leaving.  My language teacher cried when I told him I was leaving, which is unheard of in this culture.  Neither men nor women cry. Now why am I leaving you ask?  Well, my friends in development might be able to guess. My policies related to development do not really coincide with peace corps.  I won't delve into too much here, but man.  I dispassionately disagree with their approaches to health related development in senegal and if you really want to hear why and how, call me. Most of the volunteers told me there is alot of sitting around for 2 years.  one even said "peace corps was great, i learned how to sit on my arse for two years." fabulous. y'all know how well i do just sitting on my arse - not very.   a plus with the PC is that they do have awesome language training.  i can speak conversational pulaar and french now thanks to PC.  here's a sentence: maa a mi yah amerik alkamesa, kono mi anda hande, ina wawwii wande waktujii sappo cappanti tatti.  translation - i will go to the US on wednesday, but i don't know when, it's possible i'll leave at 10:30. so now when i return the fast and furious job hunt is on.  i won't take just anything, but almost.  and HOPEFULLY it will be in DC. big props to my twin brother GEORGE (TANJA) who got into the london school of economics!!!!  heck yeah! some more people to visit around the world.  i get to go to weddings now! loads of them! 7 or 8 over the next 1.5 years or so.   BIG HECK YEAH TO THE FACT THAT I GET TO SEE HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!!!! Ok, that's all for now.  I may keep the blog up, but I won't send mass e-mails about it because my life in the states won't be that cool. kisses. ps-when i return to the states i'll be without car and cell phone.  indefinitely, which is fine by me. www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      I have a thing for superheroes.  Wolverine, mmmhmm, the only man in the world who can make side-burns look sexy.  Then there is Batman.  Something about a tight black rubber suit, a fast car and a big....house makes me weak in the knees.  And who can forget Superman! Dorky reporter by day, hottie with a red cape by night! But the most amazing, intelligent, gorgeous super hero of all is Spiderman.  It is no surprise to any of you that  Spiderman 2  is le film du jour.  Oooh la la.   Peter Parker (his supreme vegetarian hotness - Tobey Maguire) is misunderstood.  While saving New York City does have its benefits, it can ruin a man's personal life.  Peter is fired from one of his two jobs.  He is chronically late for class.  His best friend, Harry, has a grudge against him for siding with Spiderman about the Green Goblin's murder.  He and Mary Jane love each other. But for reasons beyond her understanding, they can't be together.  Nice guys never get the girl, do they?  And to top it all off, he has a paper due on fusion.  Life is rough for the superhero.  Does it get easier? Of course not! It's about to get tougher! Lucky for Peter, Harry has major connections in the science field (he is, after all, the President of Oscorps) and promises to help with Peter's paper.  Harry introduces Peter to Dr. Otto Octavius, a man renowned for his research on using fusion as a source of renewable energy.  They become really chummy. Of course, the next logical step is to invite Parker to the unveiling of his research (to a group of snotty looking people).  Wouldn't you know it?  During the demonstration, things go terribly wrong!  Catastrophe ensues when science falls into the wrong hands.  Now you have the making of a new villain that puts the Green Goblin to shame: Dr. Octopus.  Four additional appendages controlled with precision by Doc Ock's thoughts.  These appendages are a force to be reckoned with. And you thought Ron Jeremy's appendage was a force to be reckoned with... If you want more, go see the film.  The twists. The turns. The fights. The love.  All worthy of a full-on, date night production.  No matinee.  No waiting to put Spidey 2 on the Netflix queue.   This film appeals to a wide audience on so many levels.  First, Tobey IS Spiderman.  He isn't just acting as Spiderman, he IS Spiderman.  Second, Kirsten Dunst is not quite so vapid (and her hair does not look kool-aid dyed, as it does in the first).  Overall, the acting is great.  Third, the special effects are  HUGE .  The sound effects were the most amazing I've heard in a movie in years.  The last time I was blown away, by sound in a film, was in 8th grade when Jurassic Park was released (we all know the best sound effects in the world come from a U2 concert).  Fourth (the sigh factor is coming), Parker's emotional pain is unbearable.  The unrequited love is beautifully played out.  Sigh.... The film can run a little long a times.  Be patient. TRUST ME.  There are not as many cheesy lines in this film as in the first film.  The action improves exponentially.  To put the icing on the cake, Peter Parker ends-up... And then there is Harry who.... But Mary Jane runs from.... See the film, dammit! Also, thank God Tobey decided to reprise his role.    I read that he almost didn't.  Spiderman would have been played by Dunst's real-life boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal.  While I love both Gyllenhaals, my love for Tobey as Spidey is stronger.  Maybe it is those big, sad, blue eyes.  Or maybe I'm subconsciously attracted to men on vegetarian diets.  Actually, I'm sure it is because he is swoon worthy.    FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL  See this film with anyone.  Friends, family, or friends and family. On a date.  By yourself (although this would be the last option).  While viewing the film, eat traditional, standard movie going fare.  Try not to overindulge, as the film is nerve-wracking and you may be susceptible to a tummy-ache.  Personally, I ate movie food for dinner in the form of a small popcorn (none of that nasty artificial butter of course), a nerd rope and a Sprite.  In honor of Spiderman, I recommend eating something as sticky as a web.  Fun Dip is really sticky.  So are Sour Straws.  Really, there are so many options out there.    Spider man, spider man Does whatever a spider can Spins a web any size Catches thieves just like flies Look out! There comes the spider man  Is he strong?  Listen, bud He's got radioactive blood Can he swing from a thread?  Take a look overhead Hey, there! There goes the spider man  In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime Like a streak of light He arrives just in time  Spider man, spider man Friendly neighborhood spider man Wealth and fame He's ignorant Action is his reward Look out! Here comes the spider man  To him, life's a big bang up Whenever there's a hang up You'll find the spider man.      ~ THE RAMONES  www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      What is the greatest epic love story of all time?  Gone with the Wind?  That is the cliche answer.  An Affair to Remember? Remember, I said "EPIC".  Spartacus?  No - remember LOVE story.  That would only leave one answer:  Dr. Zhivago .  Sigh...   Dr. Zhivago is beautifully choreographed love story that is set during the Russian Revolution.  It is told from the point of view of Obi Want Kenobi, I mean Yevgraf Zhivago (played by Alec Guinness).  Yevgraf is Uri Zhivago's half brother, who also happens to be a general.  I can't give away as to why he's narrating the movie and to whom he is narrating.  The emotionally and physically beautiful Uri Zhivago (Omar Sharif, where are you?) is a young poet/doctor who only seeks the good in people.   I'm getting misty thinking about him. Compose. Compose.   Here is a very abridged plot summary (it is a 3.5 hour film):  Uri Zhivago is married to Tanja, his childhood sweetheart.  They are well off, part of the bourjois, if you will.  Uri's path crosses once with a woman named Lara (played by Madame Rosemertta, Julie Christi).  The Russian Revolution begins.  Uri and his family's world is turned upside down. The Reds force him to work as a doctor on the front.  There, his path crosses with Lara's path again.  This time, she works closely with him as his nurse.  Nothing physically happens, but the emotional connection is palpable.  Sigh... But wanting to only do what is just, Uri returns to his amazingly optimistic and supportive wife.  Upon his return, he finds their house in a shambles and inhabited by loads of strangers and his family. Viva la Revolucion.  Did this phase Dr. Z? NO! He took it all in stride.    Not long after his return, he is forced to take his family to their country home for fear of being murdered by a death squad.  Everything goes downhill from there...But fear not! Uri and Lara's paths cross again.  The other love story unfolds.    I know, I know, you're thinking "How can infidelity be romantic?"  It is fiction, remember.  With fiction anything is possible.  The filmmakers do a fabulous job confusing the viewer.  What woman do we want to eternally win the heart of Uri?  The cute, sweet and faithful wife or the beautiful, sincere, and amazing mistress?  It is a difficult decision and the movie could end no other way.  Well, it could, but then it would not leave you sighing at the end of every paragraph. SIGH....  Throughout the film, he writes poetry.  He is known throughout Russia and Europe for his poetry.  As Obi Wan says at the end of the film "No one loves poetry as much as a Russian".  This is an important detail that increases the sigh factor exponentially.  Sigh...  Recommended Film Viewing Protocol This movie can be viewed for a variety of reasons.  If you have 3.5 hours on a Sunday afternoon to spare, watch Dr. Z.  If you or your partner is a history buff, this is your film, same goes if there is a Russianphile involved.  This is not a film for the impatient or those with ADD or ADHD.  It is a film to enjoy, to take in, if you will.  I recommend a meal during the film.  Snacks won't cut it due to the duration.  If evening viewing with a significant other is your choice, buy a bottle of Stoli.  Stoli Oranj, because it is in between Red and White (which is where Uri stands).  Maybe some boiled potatoes to really set the ambiance.    Moral of the story:  Poets are cool.  Russian poets are even cooler.    www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Ah, I love a good Republican bashing.  I take any way I can get it.  What do I like even more than a Republican bashing? A George W. Bush bashing!  That gets me giddy.  Really excited.  So it should be no surprise that the movie I am reviewing tonight is  Fahrenheit 9/11 .    Michael Moore's latest documentary chronicals the connections and ties between the Bush family and the Bin Ladens and the Saud family of Saudi Arabia.  And of course it demonstrated how there is NO tie between Al Queda and Iraq. Now any good liberal would already know all of this, so do what I did.  Take a politically uninterested friend and VOILA! A new person who will probably vote for John Kerry is born!  Although John Kerry is not peaches and cream, he is better than the alternative.  I feel desperate at this point.  Get Bush out of the White House, then smack around the two party system to get some viable alternatives.  Eh hem.  I'm now stepping off the soapbox.  "There's a sayin' in Tennessee, well it's in Texas so I think it's in Tennessee - Fool me once, you can't fool me twice." ~ George W Bush  Well George W, apparently you can be fooled. Alot. Alot. Alot.  But the sad thing that the film illustrates is that Bush is mostly fooling himself.  Sure, some of the American people are susceptible to being fooled, but not me said the flea.    While it is poignant, it is not the most fluid documentary I've seen.  It jumps around quite a bit.  Iraq was portrayed as a dreamy bastian of Middle East peace before the war (it was definitely better off than it is now, but not a model country by any standards).  There are quite a few scenes that seem edited to make Moore's point (of course I excpected that - it is a blatently biased documentary).  Super Size Me (please see the review from Monday, June 21) was easier to follow.  But the film is entertaining.    Speaking of Super Size Me, it wouldn't hurt Michael Moore to lay of the trips through the McDonald's drive through.  Seriously... He can't die of a heart attack at a young age! He has many more documentaries to make!  Wait a second...What?....Huh?... Stop! No!...  Alas, this review has been cut short by John Ashcroft.

      Yesterday, I set out to watch a classical masterpiece.  An epic love story that tugs the heart strings.  I was sidetracked to say the least.  By the time 11pm rolled around, I had no intention of watching a 3 hour love story.  I was going to procrastinate (as always), UNTIL... I turned to channel 191 and VOILA!!! A little slice of digital cable heaven.  The Independent Film Channel!  Did you know that movies on IFC are completely uncensored and commercial free?  I watched the end of Pulp "I'm going to get Medival on your ass" Fiction and then proceeded to watch one of my other favorite films of the 1990s,  Trainspotting .  Ewan McGregor (the mention of his name has me speechless), loads of Scottish accents and drug addicts! All three are concepts that usually make up great movies!  Why am I revisiting Trainspotting?  Like someone addicted to heroin, I am addicted to witty dialogue and Ewan McGregor.  Trainspotting is a story about Mark Renton (vegetarian protagonist, also herion addict), Sick Boy (hot heroin addict friend), Begbie (alcoholic with napoleon complex but not with heroin addiction), Spud (never-hurt-a-fly heroin addict), and Tommy (athelete turned heroin addict).  It boils down to young Scottish blokes struggling with addiction.   Like I said before, the plot isn't the main attraction to this movie. It's the dialogue.  For example, right before Begbie accidently bags a gender illusionist, Renton says "In a thousand years, there will be no men and women, just wankers. And that's fine by me."  You could use that in an argument for gay marriage.  And then there is an answer anyone can use in a job interview (Spud's answer in his job interview as to why he is interested in the job):  "In a word: pleasure.  It's like my pleasure and other people's liesure." And then finally, what should you say to someone who is about to get into a debate about gender inequality: "That wee lassie got glassed, and no c---t leaves till I find out what c---t did it." Of course I highly recommend this new classic, but the question is, who should watch it, if it's a date movie and what you should eat while watching it.  You should watch it if you love witty dialogue.  If you are in the mood for a sweet love story that gives you a warm fuzzy feeling all over, do not watch Trainspotting.   This would be the type of date movie to watch if you have been together longer than heroin addicts stay off junk.  If you spring this movie on the other person too soon, they may think you are a freak.   While watching this movie, one should consume beer.  That's all you need, beer. It's Scottish, so if you don't drink beer while you watch it, you'll crave one afterward (luckily it does not leave one craving heroin).  No haggis.  That's all I have to say about that. I've realized I cannot pre-plan the movies that inspire me to write a review.  So no more of this pre-planning scheme.  It will be based on pure inspiration.   www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      To prepare for my trip to see  Super Size Me , the documentary about Morgan Spurlock and his quest for McDonald's greatness, I ate lunch at McDonald's.  McDonald's is one of my least favorite of the fast food chains (In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A take the top spots).  I thought McDonald's had a "value" meal with six nuggets. Apparently, I thought wrong.  The smallest chicken nugget value meal one could acquire is 10 nuggets.  Ten, as my mom says, chopped, chunked and form (which the movie brilliantly illustrates in all of its glory) chicken parts.  I couldn't eat the 10. I was stuffed after six.   Maybe I don't have good memories of McDonald's (the movie explains how adults with fond memories of the golden arches as children grow-up to be the heavy users).  The two prevailing childhood memories I have are as follows:  1. my aunt Penny took me, Scotty, Beth and Jennifer (sorry Lindsay, you were too little) to McD's for breakfast.  Scotty puked in the bushes in the McPlayland and Beth sprayed vomit all over the front of Penny's truck as we were rounding the corner to the house.  It was gross. I was six.   2.  When I was in second grade, nuggets were "invented" (or shortly before that).  Anyhow, I begged my mom to buy them (because they had to be better than those nasty burgers).  She gave in.  I took my first bite into the nugget and low and behold, there was a dark, hard, black thing in my nugget.  It definitely was not a gold nugget.  After a non-formal survey in my high school years, I found out that I wasn't the only person to experience this phenomenon.   I will admit that before embarking on a roadtrip, I will partake in McDonald's breakfast (sausage McMuffin and hash brown please).  That's about it. Now on to  Super Size Me ... It chronicles a month of Morgan Spurlock's life.  This premise alone would make the most boring movie ever.  The brilliance is that Morgan sets up rules much to the chagrin of his cool vegan-chef girlfriend (the two of them together are absolutely hysterical).  The rules are as follows:  1. He must eat what is only behind the counter of McDonald's, 2. He must eat three meals a day, only from McDonald's, 3. When asked if he would like to SuperSize it, he must oblige and 4. He must have everything on the menu at least once before the 30 days are over.   Before embarking on the hilarious and often grotesque journey, he visits three doctors - a Gastrointerologist, a Hepatologist and a General Practitioner.  All three doctors draw blood and conclude that Morgan is a very healthy adult male.  He also visits a registered dietician.  All three doctors predict that worst that could happen is that his tryglicerides (bad cholesterol) rise a little and that he may put on a few pounds.  No one could predict what happens to his body after eating three McDonald's meals a day. Aside from showing him eating and the deterioration of his health, the film evaluates the marketing of fast food and the food choices available to children.  It examines the way children eat in school cafeterias (again, thanks Mom for packing my health lunches on a daily basis).  It examines how lazy and obese American adults have become. He put on a pedometer and was only allowed to walk what the average American walks in one day (less than 2 miles).  Difficult for a man who lives in NYC (where the average person walks 5 miles/day).  The film also examines processed food as an addiction.  It covers its back by discussing how people can choose what they put in their mouth.  But how will they know their healthy options if they are inundated with fat-laden processed crap at every turn?  Super Size Me  may sound a little dry, but Morgan is hysterical.  He goes all over the country - NYC, DC, Texas, Wisconsin, West Virginia and L.A.  You will laugh one minute and be appalled the next.  You will definitely reduce your fast food intake if you are a "heavy user" as McDonald's calls it.  Now if only they would make a film like this about cheese.... At the end of the film, when Morgan receives his final blood test results, it is revealed that his cholesterol is in the dangerous range and he has developed liver damage that is only seen in alcoholics on the last weeks of a drinking binge (luckily for Morgan, his liver damage is reversible because the liver is a remarkable organ that repairs itself).  He has also gained 25 pounds.   I recommend this film as a date film, but not if you or your date is overweight/obese/fat/etc.  It may make you guys feel uncomfortable afterward (especially if you have to eat dinner - they would feel guilted into ordering a salad at the restaurant, then binge on Ben and Jerry's at home).  I would also recommend seeing it alone or taking a fast food addict friend. I do not recommend eating McDonald's beforehand to celebrate seeing the film.  Doing so made me queasy during the movie.  Blech.  While watching the film, I recommend unsalted popcorn, no butter of course, and a diet coke.  You will feel better about yourself after watching Ronald McDonald assist in destroying Morgan's liver.      www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Quit your bitching.  Wait until you see The Terminal. Then you'll realize everything else has been a cakewalk.   Sometimes when you hear of an actor and director combo like Spielberg-Hanks, you may, like me, think "This is going to be an amazing film!".  The words "cute" and "ho-hum" don't usually come to mind.  After seeing The Terminal, those were the exact two words that came to mind.  Definite rental. Maybe theatre. But only a matinee.  Definitely not with a date.  The food: the traditional kid pack which consists of a small amount of popcorn, my choice of mini-m&ms or nerd rope and a small Sprite.  I picked the M&Ms (goes well with salty popcorn), but wished I had chosen the Nerd rope because I needed something sour to cut the sweetness of the movie at times.  The Terminal is a cute, ho-hum movie about Victor Navorsky (played convincingly by Tom Hanks) who flies into Airport X in NYC from his beloved Soviet break-away republic of Krakhosia (if you look on a globe, it borders Kreplakistan, eh hem).  While he is en-route (traveling to NYC for quite an endearing reason), there is a coup in his country.  A civil war erupts and his country ceases to exist.  Therefore, upon entry into US Customs, he is informed that "America is closed" by Stanly Tucci, a high-up in the immigration/homeland security department (convincing as a typical federal by-the-rules employee).  With his very limited English ability, he figures out that he is stuck in the airport until further notice.  One would think "Hmmm, you'd think other people would be stuck with him, on that flight from Krakhosia".  You would think wrong and I would ask "Are you smoking Krak?".    The plot is sweet and charming.  Victor makes a nice life for himself in the airport (Gate 67 to be exact).  I read that Spielberg had an entire terminal replicated on a sound stage.  It was exact down to the latest Stephen King paper back on display at the airport Borders.  There also happened to be a Dean and Deluca.  It was quite impressive.  Anyway...  The most intriguing part of the story is that it is based on the true life story of an Iranian man who lives in the Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris (I did not see him last time I flew into De Gaulle, but next time I'll be on the look out).  Victor was only stuck in the airport for about 9 or 10 months.  I think the Iranian in Paris has been there for 25 years.  A perk, besides Tom Hanks (who does a great accent - reminded me of the crazy Mafioso at the Uzbek embassy - the "big trouble and pain" guy) was the totally hot Diego Luna (from Y Tu Mama Tambien).  He and Victor develop a symbiotic relationship.  Diego drives the food cart.  He gives Victor food for favors (again people - mind out of the gutter!).  I can't tell you what the favors are, but it is also cute and endearing.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Amelia, Victor's love interest.  And while you may think "I know where this is going", you don't!!! There is no Hollywood ending! So spend your six dollars on a Sunday afternoon for a different movie going experience.    The movie made me think of what airport in which I would take up residence if needed.  Of the all the airports (European, developing world and US considered), I would have to say Midway Airport in Chicago would be the best place to reside. Hands down.  It's clean. There are a variety of restaurants and a cool toy store.  There were also an abnormal amount of hot guys (less overweight, ignorant tourists than most airports).  And Midwesterners are so darn friendly.  Chicago is the friendliest big city in the US.    I'm excited about the next movie I'm setting out to review. It will be a surprise to behold... I'll give you a hint. In order to prepare, I'll have lunch at a certain fast food restaurant.  I'm sure that all but gave it away...   www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Richard Gere, star of some fabulous movies like Chicago, Unfaithful, Runaway Bride and, of course, Pretty Woman, starred in a not-so-fabulous, oh so boring movie in 1980 called American Gigolo.  Why did I choose this movie? I don't know. I wish I hadn't.  That is two hours of my life I can never get back.  But it was on HBO, so at least I didn't have to pay for it.   I'll tell you why I chose this movie.  I like Richard Gere.  He's hot. He's sensual. He plays a variety of characters.  I've heard of American Gigolo.  Viola.  A Richard Gere movie I've never seen.  A movie I would have not thought to put on the Netflix queue, but never the less, something I felt I should see. Like Taxi Driver. Or NOT.   I should explain the redeeming qualities of the film before I kill it.  First, we get to see a buff Richard fully naked! That's right; young, hot Gere totally in the nude. After that scene you should turn off the movie.  You really don't need to watch anymore unless you want to fall asleep.  One more thing, Hector Elizando is in this film.  He's great too and seems to be Richard's film partner in crime as they were also in Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride together.  Maybe they go to Tibet together to free the Buddhists. Or maybe they both summer with the Dali Lama in the Hamptons.   Ok, to the booooring plot. Richard is a gigolo called Julian.  He's paid loads of money to satisfy and hang out with bored Beverly Hills housewives (and no, while there are plenty of breasts, there are no good sex scenes - you need to rent Unfaithful for that - ooh la la).  Julian is framed for the murder of one of his kinkier clients.  We go through the movie as he desperately searches for a legal alibi (the old lady that paid him for services the night of the murder isn't talking).  BOO HOO - in the words of Justin Timberlake - "Cry me a river", Julian.  He eventually gets off thanks to his vapid girlfriend, Michelle (Lauren Hutton).  She also happens to be the wife of a California senator. We never find out who framed him. There is absolutely no suspense.  No fabulous one line zingers or quips like the aforementioned new classic, Taxi Driver (which is ok, but not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be).  The few gay men that are in the film are horrible stereotypes of gay men (there was a scene in a gay club - and no, Julian did not do "fags" as he put it - where all the men are totally buff and either leather or flannel clad, the logger or the leather daddy look that is so passe and stereotypical).  But it was filmed in 1980...Still, no excuse for BOREDOM. It was so boring that I made myself lunch without pausing it.  It was so boring that I fast-forwarded through scenes where there was no dialogue, and even through some scenes where there was.   When should you watch this movie? If you are suffering from insomnia or if you want to see Richard Gere totally naked for about five minutes.  If you were to watch this movie, I recommend your beverage of choice be coffee to keep you awake and your food of choice to be sour gummy worms - for the sugar.   www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      I'm different from professional movie critics for a few reasons.  First, I'm obviously offering my services free of charge.  Second, I do not write for a major newspaper (although my letter to the editor was published in the Charlotte Observer today - YAY!), or any newspaper for that matter.  Third, I LOVE Adam Sandler movies (except Little Nicki really sucked, but that is one out of, what, 8 or 9?).  I mean I really really LOVE his movies. When I realized that 50 First Dates came out on DVD today, I had to forego watching Lost In Translation for the fourth time to see 50 First Dates for the first time. Or did I watch it the first time yesterday? Or the day before? Will I watch it for the first time tomorrow? Eh hem. On to the review.  For those of you who don't know, 50 First Dates is about a man named Harry (Adam Sandler) and his love trials and tribulations with Lucy (super adorable Drew Barrymore).  The problem is Lucy has had short term memory loss for the past year.  She was in a terrible car accident. So similar, but different, to Groundhog's Day.  In G-Day, Bill Murray (there he is again, damn, what a hottie!), is concious that he is re-living the same day over and over again, while the rest of the world is not.  In 50 First Dates, Drew Barrymore is unaware that she is re-living the same day, over and over again, while everyone else is fully concious of that fact.    I don't want to go too much into the plot for two reasons: 1. There isn't a major brain strain with this plot and 2. I don't want to give away the ending (which is not as Hollywood as you might think...well at least not as Hollywood as Win A Date With Tad Hamilton).  But this is a definite date movie.  You and your S.O. will both enjoy the film (unless you are an intellectual movie snob who only watches foreign and/or indie films).  Your average guy will enjoy the Adam Sandler smart arse quips (along with some slapstick thanks to Rob Schneider).  All the average women and gay men will love the unique love story and the adorable Drew Barrymore.  I'm already smitten with both Adam and Drew, so I was sold with the DVD case.  Oh yeah, and there are marine mammals involved (get your mind out of the gutter! not in that way!!!).  Adam just happens to be a marine life veterinarian and the movie takes place in Hawaii.    So anyway, 50 First Dates is another movie worthy of the Netflix queue.  It takes awhile to speed up, but I laughed out loud twice during the film (I was watching it alone - a big deal to laugh alone) and shed a few tears of "how adorable!" at the end.  What can I say?  I'm the only film critic who loves Adam Sandler...And after the atrocious, abysmal, awful Charlie's Angels 2, I may be the only one who loves Drew Barrymore.  I'm not sure what the next film will be...I'll pick something that I may not like, but force myself to watch.  Maybe a Western?    www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Raise your hand if you wish you could pay for your sins by living a mundane, abused existence in an Irish Penitential Asylum ran by sex starved, uptight nuns? No one? What a shocker. The Magdalene Sisters is a powerful movie about the penitential asylum system that was in place in Ireland from the 1880's until the final closing of one such center in 1996.  It chronicled the lives of three women (Bernadette, Margaret and Rose) who were forced into an asylum for "wayward" behavior that shamed your family (and of course, went against Catholicism).  Bernadette, who lived in an orphanage, was caught talking to boys through a fence.  Margaret was raped by her cousin.  Rose had a baby boy out of wedlock.  Their embarrassed families and the orphanage sent them off to St. Magdalene's Asylum to be under the care of Nurse Ratchett type nuns.  All I can say, is that either: A) These nuns did not get enough fiber B)Celibacy isn't all its cracked up to be C)Irish-Catholic nuns in the 1960s had a secret S&M culture going on or D) all of the above.   The women at this institution were forced to wash clothes in scalding water all day, clean the Asylum, sustain severe beatings, be humiliated while naked in the shower, not have any contact with the outside world, and give sexual favors to the priests. They were desperate to escape.  The only way you were legally free from the institution was if a male relative came to collect you.  Margaret was lucky enough to have her brother collect her.  Bernadette and Rose escaped - thanks mostly to Bernadette's determination and crazed, fearless behavior as they made their way out.   This would make a great film if you have a film club (i.e.- Carmella Soprano style) or you are in a poignant film mood.  The intensity of the film is, in large part, captured by the cinematography (and of course the amazing acting).  It could be a "date night" film - especially if you would like to test the analytical capacity of you S.O.  Otherwise, keep it as a film to watch with your arthouse movie friend(s).  We all have one (or more) that is more than happy to head to the indie film theatre to catch a flick. So add it to your Netflix rental queue today.  I think the next film I shall review will be Lost In Translation. Everyone knows I love it, but I think a formal review is necessary to illustrate why I love it.  www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Sigh. Wake-up around, well, whenever you feel like it because you do not have anywhere to be.  Reflect on the larium induced dreams you are still having.  Make some coffee. Read the paper. Eat. Feed the cat. Go downstairs and hope that you will receive an e-mail from a prospective employer that says "Dear Kelly, You rocked our world.  We would like to start right away.  I hope international travel is ok with you.  Please call us now!" When that doesn't happen, you IM your friends who are working. They reassure that working isn't that great.  I remind them that when you work, you receive a paycheck. You live on your own.  When you are unemployed, you live with your parents. Parents like to nag.  Parents like to remind you that they pay for everything.  That is when you remind them that you would rather live in a hut in a 145 degrees in Senegal than hear them talk anymore smack.  But, such is the choice I have to live with.  I chose to come home because in my subconcious, I would rather be sitting around looking for jobs than sitting in a hut looking a bugs. But you know what?  I'm not going to let unemployment get me down.  I had an epiphany while I was running today.  I could either sink into a pity-party unemployed depression or I could do what I do best: rock-on and be fabulous!  Yes, that's right. I shall continue being fabulous.  I will maintain my fabulous status by reading, writing, applying for jobs all over the world (I applied for two in Honduras, next up is China) and in DC. I shall also keep hope alive that someday I will be a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine and have the perfectly orchestrated interview with Bono, The Edge, Larry and Adam.   As for my latest movie review.... Last night I watched "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton". It has cutie pie, Topher Grace from "That 70s Show", some blonde chick playing a cute girl-next-door blonde chick, Jack McFarlan (aka Sean Hayes) and uber-broadway star, Nathan Lane. There is a really hot guy that plays Tad Hamilton.  So, the plot.  It's exactly how you would imagine a Hollywood studio romantic-comedy to play out.  Boy likes girl, girl likes hot, but misguided hollywood hunk, hunk lusts after girl, girl realizes hometown boy is a better choice than hollywood hunk.  They live happily ever after.  It was unnecessary for the actors to reach into the depths of their soul to play these roles. I think that Sean Hayes and Nathan Lane were underused.  They need their own movie and I could co-star as their fag hag/fruit fly (say, has anyone ever heard of a professional fag hag? if you know of an opening, give me a call - I can provide excellent references).   I definitely recommend "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton" to chicks who are feeling a bit blue, but it would be a TERRIBLE date movie.  A great PMS movie though.  It gives you one of those sick warm and fuzzy feelings when it is all over.  The type of feeling you need if you are unemployed and PMSing.   I am about to watch the Magdalene Sisters... a review will be coming tomorrow...  Kelly Thompson - I watch and review movies so you do not need to waste your money on crap.  That's my job.  www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      I am aware that many people in this country are completely obsessed with Ronald Reagan.  Heck, if they weren't, there wouldn't be the "Name-every-building-after-Reagan" Coalition.  These are the psychos that brought us the Ronald Reagan Building (its ironic that it is the main office for USAID, the foreign aid facet of the federal government) and Reagan National Airport before the man even kicked the bucket.    BUT....please mourn quietly and MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.  The man was ninety-freakin-three when he died. He died of a terminal disease, not suddenly.  Please put something else on the news, in the newspaper, etc.  Now of course, if Bono died (God forbid!), I would want tributes to him all over the place (while he has never been President, he has been quite the humanitarian, much more than many presidents), but I realize that would be selfish.  All the non-Bono lovers out there would be put out.  Then they would become disgruntled with the media.  That would inevitably lead to ill will toward the man himself.  Which will eventually happen with Reagan (well, I felt that toward him before he died).  Anyway, whoever reads this, if you have not had the privledge of seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, get your lazy ARSE UP TO THE THEATRE!!!!  Don't drink another pint of butter beer. Don't lounge around on your Muggle arse.  Get thyself to a theatre.  Daniel Radcliffe does a superb job as Harry.  He is developing as an actor (and as a future hottie - but for now he's almost 15, so he's just a cutie).  He needs to work on the crying a bit, but the anger works!  I believe he's angry!  Of course my British leading men, Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman (especially Gary as my favorite - Sirius Black) delivered. Snape is never hot, but always snotty and clever, which many women find to be hot.  Sirius was hot in that "I-need-dentist-and-a-shower-and-I'll-be-good-to-go" way.  A frosty, bone chilling atmosphere was created by the Dementors. Nasty creatures, they are!  And the whomping willow has burrowed a place in my heart. As did the Fat Lady, who was played by Daun French (she co-wrote Absolutely Fabulous with the Fairy Godmother from Shrek 2, Jennifer Saunders, so she already had a place in my heart).  Oh good gracious, I almost forgot! BUCKBEAK!!!! The proud hippogriff befriended Harry, Hermione and Sirius when they were in dire straits.  Way to go Beaky!!!  Now for the down sides (yes, it's not all smiles I'm afraid).  Rupert Grint still can barely act.  He just whines and frowns his way through the movie.  David Thewlis did an amazing job as Professor Lupin, but did the CGI guys revert back to 1994 when it came to making the Werewolf?  That was not scary enough!  The transformation was AWESOME but the actual wolf was quit a disappointment.  In the news of the random (visit U2.com today), I just found out that Anton Corbijn (U2's amazing photographer) has a blog!  It's quite interesting.  A handful of famous people have blogs.    www.au-senegal.com www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      Last night was dark and stormy in the District of Columbia.&nbsp; When pondering whether we should continue watching random TV or a movie, we settled for a movie, preferably one that suited a dark, stormy night.&nbsp; Everyone involved decided  28 Days Later  would be the chosen film.&nbsp; Two out of three of us hadn't seen it.&nbsp; I was all for it.&nbsp; The only other zombie film I had seen was Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&nbsp; Zombies move as slow as snails.&nbsp; How scary could this zombie film be?&nbsp; A parapalegic without a wheelchair could outrun a zombie.... or so I thought...   Enter modern day England.&nbsp; The film begins with&nbsp;three animal rights activists trying to free some&nbsp;monkeys in a test lab.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to the activists, the monkeys have been "infected"with a rage virus.&nbsp; The dumb activist doesn't listen to the pleading lab tech, frees the monkey and voila! A zoonotic virus is born.&nbsp; It's a PETA public relations nightmare.&nbsp; Twenty seconds later....she's infected and so our story begins.   We jump to 28 days later where a young man, Jim (hottie actor Cillian Murphy)&nbsp;wakes up from a coma. He finds himself in an empty hospital.&nbsp; He walks out to the empty streets of London.&nbsp; Everything is deserted.&nbsp; There is no one to be seen.&nbsp; He is definitely having a "What the f-ck is going on?" moment.&nbsp; He goes into a church only to find loads of dead bodies and.....ZOMBIES!!!!&nbsp; These are not invasion of the body snatcher zombies, these are full on Marion-Jones-on-steriods running zombies!&nbsp;   So out of the church he runs, and luckily, runs right into two non-infected people.&nbsp; That is where the true adventure and true horror unfolds.&nbsp; Jim, with the help of friends he makes along the way,&nbsp;battles his&nbsp;way across England for suvival.&nbsp; He goes from being lost and disenfranchised to a total arse-kicker!&nbsp; Two hours later you need a neck and shoulder massage.&nbsp;   The director, Danny Boyle (see previously reviewed favorite  Trainspotting ) has a knack for creating scenes that make you jump a mile high.&nbsp;&nbsp; The music doesn't give away when the next zombie is going to jump out.&nbsp; He also causes the viewer to think "damn, what would I do if I woke up to find my world (not THE world) turned upside down?".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would run my ass to English Channel and take my chances with the shark. That's what I would do!   Running zombies, british accents, a hot main character, great plot, nice ending.&nbsp; Lots of blood and moral dilemmas.&nbsp; Initially, I thought the film was good, but too stressful to watch again.&nbsp; But after reflecting, I decided I would watch it again.&nbsp; Just not for a few weeks... And definitely during the day... With something like Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me to follow...   FILM VIEWING PROTOCAL  Calling all suspense/horror film lovers! This is the film for you.  Definitely DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ALONE!&nbsp; You have to see it with a friend or significant other (preferably the sig other).&nbsp; Viewing alone could cause severe paranoia.&nbsp; If you want to be creeped out, view the film at night.&nbsp; Otherwise, view the film during the day and follow it with a fluff movie, preferably a romantic-comedy.&nbsp;  Since it is a zombie film, it is only approppriate that you drink Zombies while viewing 28 Days Later.&nbsp; You may also want to eat Monkey Bread.&nbsp; It is tastey and apropriate as well.   Here is a recipe for a Zombie:&nbsp;  Ingredients:  Light Rum  Dark Rum  Pineapple Juice  Orange Juice  Lemon Juice  Powdered Sugar  Overproof Rum ("151")  Ice  Pineapple Slice  Cherry  Directions:  1. Shake ¾ oz. Light Rum, ¾ oz. Dark Rum, 1 oz. Pineapple Juice, 1 oz. Orange Juice, 1 oz. Lemmon Juice, and 1 tsp. Powdered Sugar with Ice.  2. Strain into a tall glass (with or without ice).  3. Float a dash of Overproof Rum on top  4. Garnish with a Pineapple Slice and/or a Cherry.   Recipe for Monkey Bread:   3 cans frozen biscuits  1-1/2 cup sugar, divided  bodyOffer(17754)  1-1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  1 cup pecans, diced  1-1/2 stick butter  1/4 cup brown sugar  1 cup evaporated milk  Directions:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut each biscuit into four pieces. Combine 1/2 cup of the sugar, cinnamon, and pecans. Roll biscuits in sugar mixture. Place in greased bundt pan. Bring butter, brown sugar, remaining sugar and evaporated milk to a boil. Pour immediately over biscuits. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove immediately from pan.   www.u2.com  www.csmonitor.com  www.megwood.com

      People see films for many reasons.&nbsp; Some people see films to be entertained.&nbsp; Some people see films to be informed.&nbsp; Some people, like my friend Katie, see films for their weirdness factor.&nbsp;  Repo Man  is a gem from 1985 that is entertaining, informative (in a anti-consumerism, anti-war sort of way) and WEIRD.&nbsp; I watched this film after viewing Donnie Darko.&nbsp; The weirdness factor was almost, but not quite, too much. Otto (Emilio Estevez's best performance - forget The Mighty Ducks, oh wait, you already did), is a punk 18 or 21 year old living in L.A.&nbsp; At the beginning of the film, he loses his loser job as a stocker in a grocery store.&nbsp; After losing his job, he goes slam dancing, drinks Beer and wanders the streets of L.A.&nbsp;As his wandering continues through the morning, he is conned by a repo guy into "stealing" someone's car.&nbsp; Once at the repo lot, he is offered a job as a repo man.&nbsp; Otto takes the job.&nbsp; He repos cars without remorse.&nbsp; He seems to enjoy the company of his fellow repo men even when crazy things happen to them, including encounters with UFOs (United Fruitcake Organization and those of the ET variety).&nbsp;&nbsp;  The best reason to see the film is for the dialogue.&nbsp; For example, Otto's partner (Molly Ringwald's father in Pretty In Pink, Harry Dean Stanton) says "Lets go get a drink."&nbsp; The next scene cuts them in a store buying a six pack of Drink.&nbsp; The beer of choice is Beer.&nbsp; The food of choice is Food, even though you can also choose from Potato Chips and Cereal.&nbsp; There is NO product placement in the film.&nbsp; There is a hysterical scene in which Otto is talking to his parents in their living room.&nbsp; The title of this review was taken from a line in that scene.&nbsp;  The social commentary is rampant.&nbsp; Otto is watching the news in one scene, and while the TV is background noise, the story on the news is about the US sending troops to Guatemala and El Salvador to lay waste to indigenous villages.&nbsp; There is also a scene where the older repo men make fun of people who car pool (ironically, while they are all riding together), "commies" and "fags".&nbsp;  The film was written and directed by Alex Cox.&nbsp; Marshall, take note - he was a Fulbright Scholar!&nbsp; He left law school in England to attend film school at UCLA.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL   Honestly, see this film if you have an open mind about movies.&nbsp; Ignore the plot and special effects but&nbsp;pay attention to the dialogue.&nbsp; It is a Saturday night DVD or video rental - with cool friends and/or cool significant other. Judge their coolness factor at their own risk  I recommend eating Candy and Popcorn, and drinking a Drink during the film.&nbsp; Actually, I recommend Reese's Pieces because they seem to be the candy choice of Extra Terrestrials.&nbsp; Maybe drink Beer - that would make the film more comical.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  www.u2.com  www.csmonitor.com  www.megwood.com

      A plethora of films are going to be reviewed within the next two weeks.&nbsp; My current residence is in the apartment of a fabulous couple that lives in DC.&nbsp; One of them happens to be a screenwriter.&nbsp; Screenwriter =&nbsp; kick ass/weird ass&nbsp;film library!&nbsp;  This week, there was a request made for me to review  Donnie Darko. &nbsp; For the first time, I actually obliged.&nbsp; The film is in my temporary DVD library.&nbsp; I've always wanted to see it. Voila.&nbsp; I am reviewing  Donnie Darko .&nbsp; Is that a coincidence?&nbsp; Or did Frank tell me to do it for a reason?&nbsp;  It is October of 1988.&nbsp; Dukakis is running for president.&nbsp; Star Search is on TV.&nbsp; People still drive Trans Ams.&nbsp; The Darkos live in a quiet upper-middle class town called Middlesex.&nbsp; They have two girls, one in elementary school, the other is going to Harvard; and a boy who has schizophrenic induced hallucinations.&nbsp; Please meet Donnie Darko.  Donnie, played by the smoldering Jake Gyllenhaal, is being visited by a psychotic-looking rabbit.&nbsp; The rabbit, named Frank, has quite a bit of control over Donnie.&nbsp; Even though Donnie takes medication for his schizophrenia, the hallucinations worsen as the film goes on (and you begin to ask yourself if they are really hallucinations)... Until finally, an ending so bizarre happens that you think "Do I have paranoid schizophrenia?"&nbsp;  Donnie Darko is the perfect film for those suffering from teen-angst, teens and adults alike.&nbsp; Donnie is brilliant.&nbsp; He unapologetically tells-off authority figures.&nbsp; He deals with bullies.&nbsp; He worries about the opposite sex.&nbsp; He says "rad".&nbsp;  Initially, Donnie Darko was a box office flop.&nbsp; BUT... now it is a cult classic.&nbsp; People watch it at midnight showings.&nbsp; I hope they don't confuse it with Rocky Horror as far as cult classics go.&nbsp; First, it would be awful if Jake had toilet paper and toast thrown at his head, but second (and more important) Donnie Darko is actually a great film.&nbsp; It is intense, bizarre, creepy and kooky.&nbsp; If the premise of the film does not lure you in, maybe the cast will.&nbsp; Both Gyllenhaals are in the film, as is other teen star wonder, Jenna Malone.&nbsp; Big time stars Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle are in the film as well.&nbsp; There is one star that shadows over all others mentioned.&nbsp; His name will cause your spine to shiver (either with repulsion or joy).&nbsp; Patrick Swayze!&nbsp; He's not dancing, he's not a ghost, and he's not a drag queen.&nbsp; He is a motivational speaker (of the most horrific variety).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL  Unless you live in a city that has midnight showings of DD (it is rumored to play here, in DC, at Visions), put it on your Netflix queue.&nbsp;  It is not a film for people who like standard film formulas.&nbsp; If you wear all black, you'll love this film.&nbsp; If you were in your high school drama club, you too will love this film.&nbsp; If you liked "One Flew Over The Cukoo's Nest", you'll like this film.&nbsp; If you have ever or are currently experiencing teen angst, you'll enjoy this film.&nbsp; I happen to fall into&nbsp;three of the above&nbsp;four categories.&nbsp;  Versatile viewing is possible (date film, friend film, alone film), as long as the date and/or the friends fall into one of the above categories.&nbsp;  Food consumption during the film:&nbsp; water and a piece of fruit.&nbsp; I recommend water and a piece of fruit because afterward one should partake in yoga or another form of exercise/meditation to clear your mind.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  www.u2.com  www.csmonitor.com  www.megwood.com

      Warning: the use of cliche adjectives to describe a movie is in the following review. Please proceed with caution.  I have never used the word raw as an adjective before, unless I was describing a cut of meat, poultry or fish. The first word that popped into my head while viewing  21 Grams  was "raw". Other ways to describe it is edgy, gut-wrenching, tragic, addicting, gritty as my shower in Senegal, and suspenseful.   21 Grams  is a film about the intersection of three lives. There is no linear plot line and the film is not entirely clear until the last scene. It is filled with puzzle pieces of a few months in the lives of three people - Paul Rivers (Sean "I'm miserable" Penn), Christina Peck (Naomi "Someone get this girl an Oscar" Watts) and Jack Jordan (Benicio "I have a shifty look in my eyes" Del Toro).  For obvious reasons, I can't divulge the plot (its not my fault - I swear - blame the director). However, the direction, acting and cinematography were almost brilliant...Almost brilliant, but not quite, for a few reasons...  Since the plot is non-linear, each scene varies in length from around 30 seconds to five to ten minutes. This "cool" effect is only cool for about the first hour of the film, then it's just annoying (by chance, if you enjoy the non-linear plot films, I recommend "Amores Perros", which was, like  21 Grams , directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu). If each puzzle piece scene were longer, this effect probably would not have been annoying. Although, the film makers earn cool points back for using a camera lense that enhances the movie's "raw" and "gritty" feel.  Most of the "rawness" and "grittiness" can be attributed to the superb acting, done mostly by the aforementioned trio. While the supporting actors are fabulous, these three are...whoah... Naomi Watts gives her best performance on film. It's amazing when you turn beautiful women into, well, ugly women (but heck, I'll be Naomi on an ugly day anytime). It turns out they can act! Look what happened to her best bud, Nicole Kidman in "The Hours". My theory is that since they know they don't have to be bothered with a standard of perfection, they let all their emotions hang out. Where was her Oscar? I will not subject myself to "Cold Mountain" to see why another pretty-made-ugly, Renee Zellweger, beat Naomi. But it is the Oscars, not an award show based on talent. Eh hem.  Speaking of unjust Oscar winners, Sean Penn gives same believable, gut-wrenching performance he gives in every film. While it is an amazing performance, I don't feel it is a stretch for Sean. The jig is up Sean! We are fully aware that you did not want to be typecast as Jeff Spicoli for the rest of your life! You can be in a fluff piece, action movie, romantic comedy, etc. We won't hate you. We'll embrace you! Now, if you would kindly give the Oscar to Bill Murray, we can get on with the review (please refer to a February blog entry for that on going feud).  Finally, the brooding Benicio Del Toro is great, but isn't he always? From the first time I saw him in "Usual Suspects", to "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" to "Traffic" (it goes on), I knew that this was the rugged Latino for me. You can be funny! You can be serious! You can be a born again ex-convict Christian! How versatile. The Oscar for Traffic was deserved (finally!).  I apologize for the vague review, so here are some random plot pieces: Christina swims laps; Paul smokes cigarettes to the chagrin of his doctor; Jack is an ex-con Christian.   FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL  This film is not for the faint of heart, nor for those in the mood for a romantic-comedy, comedy or blow-you-up action film. If you are in a pensive mood,  21 Grams  is the film for you.  21 Grams  is also great for drama and suspense. That is what makes the film addicting, the element of suspense. You long to find out the connection and the final outcome of these peoples' lives.  I recommend this film for solo viewing on a rainy, cloudy day (too depressing for evening viewing). But if you feel you and your friends or sig other can wax philosophical when the film is finished or want to be put in a state of melancholy, try it!  As for food, I recommend no food. I was in no mood to eat anything while I was watching this film. You won't feel like enjoying candy, popcorn, or entrees. Maybe some beer would make the film go down smoother and something salty like nuts or chips to go with the beer. Other wise, stick to water.    www.u2.com  www.csmonitor.com  www.megwood.com

      The Mafia and lesbians.  Those two don't usually go together unless you are invited to a party at Bada-Bing.  Since the chances of that are next to impossible, your next best bet of encountering the Mafia and lesbians is if you watch  Bound .  Talk about a straight man's ultimate fantasy!  It is rather ironic that the film came highly recommended by a gay man.    Bound , the first major film written AND directed by the Wachowski Brothers (for those of you who were in a coma between 1999 and 2003, they wrote and directed the Matrix Trilogy), is a seductive story about two women and their attempt to thwart the Mafia out of almost three million dollars. There is a steamy lesbian sex scene, lots of violence and Ralphi Cifareto (head attached).  No more plot revelations or else I may be whacked.  On to the analysis.... Corky (no, not THAT Corky), played by Gena Gershon, is the butch carpenter/painter/plumber that is working in the apartment next door to Violet's apartment.  Gena, Gena, Gena.  No wonder you weren't asked to be in "Boys Don't Cry".   Violet, played by Jennifer Tilly, lives next door and is married to Ralphi Cifaretto, no wait...Francis Fratelli...No its Cypher...CAESAR! Joey Pants name in the film is Caesar.   Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.  No wonder you were in such acclaimed films like "Bride of Chucky" and "Haunted Mansion".   And Joey Pants - your characters are always a surprise.  For example, in The Goonies, you played a short, angry, ex-con with a Napoleon complex.  In The Matrix, you played a short, angry, computer-hacker with a Napoleon complex.  Then the real surprise came in the Sopranos when you played a short, angry, Mafioso with a Napoleon complex.  I must admit though, Caesar was the most believable character in Bound.  I'm sure Joey sticks to what he knows. What Bound lacks in acting, it makes up for in style, direction and suspense.  Many shots in this film inspired shots in The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded (don't even mention the abysmal Matrix Revolutions).  There is a kiss between Violet (who always wears violet eyeshadow) and Corky that could be mistaken for the kiss between Neo and Persephone.  Also like The Matrix, they have a brilliant way of changing scenes.   The film is aesthetically pleasing as well, and not only with the people, but with color.  The objects on the set are mostly black and white.  But there are random sitings of red, either in the form of blood or clothing, that provides a brilliant contrast.   The Wachowskis must have taken a dialogue writing course at their local community college after writing Bound.  Or maybe they let Jennifer Tilly and Gena Gershon ad-lib.  Tsk tsk tsk.  Never let the beauties ad-lib. Imagine what The Matrix would be like if Keanu ad-libbed.  Hold the phone. His dialogue in that movie was pathetic too. Morpheus, Cypher and the Oracle had all the good lines.  Although, when you are as hot as Keanu, dialogue ceases to be a factor of importance.   FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL  First, I'm pretty sure every frat boy owns or has seen this movie.  Second, I'm pretty sure many lesbians own or have seen the movie.  Who should see it besides the aforementioned sociologically classified goups?  Film connoisseurs, film students, and art aficionados.  Those demographics will be able to appreciate the film.    Bound  is definitely not a date movie.  The lesbian sex scene could be a point of contention between a straight couple for many reasons.  It would also gross out the gay male demographic for obvious reasons.  In addition, and most unfortunately, violence and blood do not a date film make.   However, if you opt to watch the film, I recommend evening viewing.  I do not recommend eating during the film, but do recommend a bottle of red wine to drink throughout the film.  It encompasses many of the themes through out the movie: it's red, it can be Italian and it makes you feel sexy.   Now I'm taking recommendations for movies to review but there are criteria:  1. I cannot have previously seen it AND 2.  You cannot tell me if you liked it or disliked it.  You can only recommend.  www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      For the first time in my life, I feel like a real film reviewer ( I don't like the word critic - too harsh). Tonight I had the priveledge of attending a free (no - I was not stealthy, it was legit) advanced screening of Garden State. Garden State is the first gem of a movie written and directed by the completely adorable Zach Braff. Zach also starred in the film. Can we say multi-tasker extraordinaire?  He WAS most famous for Scrubs - that filler show on NBC that was on between Friends and Will and Grace. Not anymore folks. This man is going to be Hollywood's next IT man. You read it here. Maybe you read it some other places as well, but you still read it here.  Garden State proves my theory about families where one or both of the parents are psychiatrists. Didn't you have one of those friends in high school who's father was a psychiatrist? I did. That family was really bizarre. Zombie like (check out the 28 Days Later review for more on zombies). In Garden State, Andrew Largeman's (Zach) father is a psychiatrist. Large (as he's called in the film) is an aspiring actor in LA who has not returned to New Jersey in nine years. Reason being, surprise, surprise, his parents are screwed-up. Unfortunately, Large's mother dies and Large returns to the land of Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and toxic waste. No wonder he stayed in Cali for nine years.  We discover that Large has been on all sorts of anti-psychotic medicine, sleep aids and painkillers since he was nine. He has not had a feeling in 16 years! Once he returns to NJ, he drops his meds cold-turkey style. No lithium patch for him. As the film unfolds, Zach's character metamorphosis (?) from a zombie like figure (funny, Fox Searchlight did 28 Days Later as well - the recurring zombie thing) to a feeling human being (who happens to have feelings for Natalie Portman's quirky character, Sam).  The aforementioned plot summary would lead one to question the comedy genre of this film. Would a drama make fun of Corky from Life Goes On? Would a drama have great lines like "I hope we didn't run around for five hours to find crack whores huffing turpentine" ? Would a drama have a seeing-eye dog hump someone's leg in a waiting room? Or a dead hamster in the late stages of rigormortis? Or make fun of Sally Struthers? NO! Sure there are dramatic aspects to the film, but I laughed my arse off WHILE I was inspired to be more vulnerable. Cool things seem to happen to vulnerable people - at least in the movies.  And then there is the soundtrack.... which comes out August 10th (but you can order your copy now on amazon.com).  Since this in an indie film, check the dates on the following website to see when it is coming to a theatre near you:  urlLink http://www.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate/gs_072604.pdf  I like spreading the indie movie word.  FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL This is a date film and a friend film. It is definitely worth seeing it in the theatre. Consider this film your movie Prozac (especially if you saw The Village). I recommend eating converastional hearts - especially those that say "You're Neat" or "Be Mine". They make you feel good. Although, they could be stale if you've had them since February (and difficult to find, I'm sure). I recommend the other feel good snack food - chocolate. It it triggers endorphines in your body (at least in us women) that make you feel good. I would also recommend red wine for the same reasons. Even though they don't sell that in theatres yet, I'm sure it won't be long before they find a way. Otherwise, as the old saying goes, have a Coke and a smile. www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com

      I saw quite a few films this week. Last Sunday, I saw Anchorman with Will Farrell. It was funny enough. Then on Wednesday I saw Kill Bill, Vol. II at the Arlington Cinema and Draft House. That kicked TOTAL ARSE! I highly recommend that film (as well as Kill Bill, Vol. I). In order to do the review justice, I'll have to watch it on DVD. Today I watched three movies! That's right - three films in one day! Thanks to my covert ops partner in crime, we got a two-for-one "deal" at the theatre today. First, we saw The Bourne Supremacy (could go either way - see it in the theatre or as a rental). We were so inspired by the spy action in the film that we decided to be steathly ourselves. Stealthy in our pathetic world equals sneaking into a film. We snuck into The Village. I wish we had decided to sneak into a bar instead. The latest film by M. Knight Shamalama-ding-dong is awful. I'm happy I did not pay money to see it or else I would be... well... angry! There are some plot spoilers coming up. If you are actually going to pay money to see it, then continue reading so you could better spend your $9.50 on a martini. Or do what I did - sneak in and then bitch about it! The film is allegedly set in 1897, but the crappy dialogue sounds like something out of the 1600s. As bad as the dialogue is, the delivery is even worse (except by the amazing and gorgeous Joaquin Phoenix - and Ron Howard's daughter doesn't do a bad job either). On to the pile of shite called the plot. There is a village that is surrounded by a forrest that is allegedly filled with evil creatures. These creatures, for some reason, like the color red. Maybe because it's sexy. Who the freak knows. The village is ran by elders. The elders know something that the rest of the village does not. Joaquin wants to find out what is beyond the village. Before he sets out on his mission, he and Ron Howard's daughter decide to get married. Adrien Brody, the village retard, gets psychotically jealous and stabs Joaquin. Ron Howard's daughter asks to leave the village to find medicine in the neighboring "towns" for Joaquin. William Hurt, an elder and Ron Howard's daughter's father tells the blind chick the truth. The village is a farce. In the 1970's, a group of jaded adults - who were screwed over by society in some way or another (I think a criteria was that a family member was murdered) started a new life in a wildlife preserve. That is the extent of what he told her. They told the lies about the forrest creatures to keep the Village People from leaving (if it were up to me - those poor saps would all be high-tailing it to the YMCA right about now). But in order to keep the village going with Joaquin and Ron Howard's blind daughter as its leaders, they had to send the blind chick to the real world to get medicine. A nice park ranger finds her. He gets her medicine. She runs back into the woods, to the village, and presumably saves the day. I forgot one thing - some where in there Adrien Brody dies. The end. Bravo.  Did she ask any questions to Kevin, the park ranger? Of course not. Does B. Night Spamalon make some random conclusion about society? Maybe. I'm sure there are many issues in the film that could be debated by the academic elite. Whatever. The bottom line is that the film left me unsatisfied. The first thing I said to my covert ops partner was "That sucked. I'm glad we didn't pay money to see it."  FILM VIEWING PROTOCOL Don't put yourself through the trouble, but if you must be prepared to watch something cool afterward. We watched Mystic River (fantastic film). It almost made me forget that I saw The Village.  www.u2.com www.csmonitor.com www.megwood.com
