I ready to take on the world. I feel so energized with that which God has given me. I want to be a good steward of it. I will makes sure that I stay in the Vine. John 15. That is what this week will be about. Hopefully from it will grow habit. I pray that it will. I have energy grace and love to do the things I need to do to be a good father, a good husband and a good leader primarily. Thank you again father and thank you for those who are praying for me. We all need a little prayer sometimes.   I am truly Bursting from the inside out with the Joy of the Lord and his Plans.

						   When we are sometimes going through our worst of circumstances the smallest things are Joys to us. This morning I spent alot of time getting my daughter ready for church. More than I ever had before. I literally enjoyed every minute of it. Even when she fussed. I know that the 2 things that My Father in heaven has allowed in    my immediate life are my daughter and my realtionship to God. These are suffice to bring anyone through.      Today was an offset of Saturday. I have left that behind looking to see what awaits my future. I am looking for that open door. I know there is a purpose and a plan and I am not ignorant to it. I just have to stay tuned into it.   I don't exspect anyone not even my own family to understand me right now. This is why my realtionship with Jesus is so very important. In difficult times family and even friends will shut you off .  There is only so much people can deal with. It is 6am monday morning and for whatever reason this Blog has taken 1 and 1/2 nights to write. I sleepy all day after having one of the greatest fathers day dinners I have ever had cooked by my father. I enjoyed my time with my father. I wish he would have spent a little more time with me. He trys his very best. It is difficult for him to show feeling so under his hustle and bustle of gettting things done his heart is in the right place usually. Sometimes his pain. pains me. For some reason there is something very great missing in his life. He trys to fill it up with other things. My heart is that one day he will find what this is.

						   Today for "Fathers Day" I went to visit my wife. (If I have not already mentioned she is in a Treatment center till she gets better. I was waiting for her recovery.) She looked beautiful. All dressed up nice and I saw her. She seemed suprised that I was there. I did not understand why? Upon getting some hamburgers a hot dog and drinks and chips for this "Father's Day Celebration" I was intoduced to my wifes new boyfriend. She said it had to be uncovered but it was the wrong time. I was deveisted and in pain. Aside from the Pain. I had been waiting almost as I see it 5 yrs for my wifes recovery. I had faith that god would bring her through but sometimes it is not always how we would like it. That night I danced all night trying to stay away from the situation and allowing my wife to visit her daughter. Ultimatly I could not longer keep it in. I left in a hurry and cried all the way home. There was a pain that I cannot possible explain and will not go into any effort to explain. Sometimes answer comes in the pain. yes" Lord where to now? What must I do? Sometimes being fathiful does not always have it rewards however faithfulness is the reward in itself. I love you Adrianna and Always will and I will never give up knowing that my Father in Heaven can change things. I also know that they are not always what we choose. What we want. Or even sometimes what we need or think that we need. Jesus Christ is the only thing that can determine that. This is what we mean by Master...Maker...Creator....  To least I was ticked...upset, distraut, in pain, suffering, disillusioned and angry. Thank you lord for bringing me back.

						   I got real blessed today. I got this revelation from one of the deacons at the church today that allowed me to see things entirely different. The Revelation was one day "Maurice" our deacon was sitting around wondering why people could not be more like me. Read more... Pray more..  listen more...etc...  then while wondering this all day long he got along with God and God (The Lord Jesus Christ) asked him.  Why can't you be me like me.     This is so deep it cut hard. We sit and judge others about where and when they should be somewhere, someplace or where they should be at in their walk or even in their relationships, job, homelife etc.. when in fact we all come short of the glory of the lord. Why must we hold ourselves as Gods and ask others to be like us.

						   I remember so shortly that  I had almost everything . I had a job paying about 3.5 to 4 K a month. I had my wife by my side a new baby girl and life did not seem right. I working at a computer company as a FAE - Feild Application (Jargon for Computer Techician who flys all the time).  It seemed I had the world in my hand.  I placed a time at a local coffee shop to write poetry and short rants proving that God did not exisit and that religion was an excuse for people; a crutch and a place I would never step into.  I believed that we were our own Gods and life itself revolved around me.  Though my shiny new Dodge Intrepid reflected the sun right and cash was in pocket. My happiness was not exactly there. Actually come to think about it.  I actually thought I was happy. I just had nothing to compare it to.  Getting married at an early age.  Living a life of lies.  Pretty much anything that came from my mouth was a lie.  I was addicted to myself..addicted to money and believed that this was what it was about....I was never really a bad person perse. Like most I felt I have not killed anyone or hurt anyone that much and I really never stole anything.  So I felt ...Hey what do I need to change?!   Then one day things changed...   It all happened in a little city called Claremont. Around 2 1/2 years ago. I realized that  Life was so much more and eventually choose the path that leads to (eternal) Joy not temporal happiness and found a place to hang my old self out to dry.  In the process I had to leave my situation with my wife and daughter ulimatly finding out that  God is truly the only one that can change people, things and situations.    I have never been much of a person to tell stories.  I am an abstract writer so this is going to be my attempt at telling my story via a daily Blog.  This story is not to boost me up for I have made many errors. Very bad desions and  I am no poster boy for rightousness.   However This story as you will see proves the wonder that is Jesus Christ. THe purpose the plan and the people whom he calls daughter and Son.   This blog will be full of personal ideas... issues of the day as well as simple theology and maybe a doorway for you to open to see the very intimate very captivating side of a REAL PERSONS LIFE.

						   I really don't know what to put in here.  This is my first blog and I have many ideas. But as you will see from the post I am very wild and crazy guy.  I am the most unfocused person you could possible ever imagine.  Computers, Music, Graphics, Film, Writing..'poetry...rants and raves, Worship music.... I do love the arts.  I have this strange balance ..of inbalance.  Luckily I have christ in my heart.  Without him no telling where I would be.

						   Everyone enjoys the love and the Joy. The Blessings the Power and the Grace and the Mercy.&nbsp; however many when it comes to the wisdom of God to make choices contrary to the standards of the world usually fall or fail to make those choices.&nbsp; I myself am guilty of this.  Many times we have people speaking against us. In a manner that is not encouraging or changing but it destructive.&nbsp; Sometimes the destructive realationship can sufficate the Gift that God has given you because your&nbsp;not "Smart Enough" "Thin enough"&nbsp; "Strong Enough".&nbsp; Funny to know that Moses was a man who was not skilled in his speech.&nbsp; His was not articulate in his speech meaning that he possible stuttered when he spoke.&nbsp; Which is why the Lord gave him Abraham to speak for him.&nbsp; Interesting enough Gidieon was a considered to be a "Strong Warrior" when he was hiding in&nbsp;a nearby Cave in fear of battle.&nbsp; Or David who's heart was&nbsp;a man's heart for God who&nbsp;commited adultery, murdered the husband in battle and covered it up.&nbsp; &nbsp; My point is that contrary to what people might say these toxic relationship will destroy the plan that God has for your life because their voice sometimes for many is heard louder than the scriptures themselves.  We have to be very careful what Toxic relationships are doing to ourlives.&nbsp; Toxic relationships can change our views.&nbsp; Change our mindsets.&nbsp; Change our goals and ultimatly lead us to destruction.&nbsp; In gods wisdom his says that if your eye should cause you to sin then you should plug it out.&nbsp; How much more a Toxic realationship.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   Though you may be asking why all the poems? many have inspired me.&nbsp; Self inspiration is a powerful thing.&nbsp; Though self sometime brings pain.&nbsp; Introversion and many times depression when you reflect upon your lord and savior we do not need to loose our creativity but can hone that creativty and use it as a tool for kingdom purpose.&nbsp; As you might have guessed from my journal entries I do enjoy writing.&nbsp; As much as however I enjoy writing I do enjoy reading.&nbsp; Recently I stumbled upon something that I know I have been doing but had no words to explain it.&nbsp; Using the nagative things of this world as a positive catapult can be a task indeed but when you look through the eyes that Christ has given you we realize that through him.&nbsp; yes "we can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens us but we can also know that "Good things&nbsp; come to though who are in Christ jesus who are in his will and in his plan."&nbsp; If we believe truly in him not just in his word but in him.&nbsp; We truly will see miracles.&nbsp; We sometimes want God to act quickly in our lives when we ourselves are creeking around like sloths.&nbsp; I have just recently come to understand that spiritually I have been growing but in other things I have neglected.&nbsp; Can one have one and the other.&nbsp; I do believe we can.&nbsp; My desire has been to seek a better understanding God his purpose and his kindom mindedness. To truly understand the concept of worship and therby be a better example of Christ in my own life.&nbsp; Many times I fall short.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look from the worlds persepective and see a man struggling and holding onto a dream ..air if you will.&nbsp; However looking at it in a Kingdom perspective I see someone patiently understanding true purpose and waiting for his commands for his commanding officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; If our lives on this world that Christ has given us was for no purpose then why would we be here?&nbsp; His purpose is clear when the Lord says what his purpose is for us to be here.&nbsp; If one was to Look at Paul today or any of the other deciples would they be looked favorably by todays standards.&nbsp; No they woudl not.&nbsp; Many of them left their flourishing business and families to follow Christ.&nbsp; Someone today would say they were bums who left to follow the circus or left to follow some crazy man.&nbsp; Leaving their business and families behind.&nbsp; This indeed would not be a great picture.&nbsp; However this Negative thing that would seem would be the only choice and today our choice when it comes to serving God.&nbsp; Many times it is not our family..however sometimes it is our old lives, our habits, our bondages that we have fought over and over and simply for one reason.&nbsp; We do not want to leave.&nbsp; This man Jesus Christ would later bring healing.&nbsp; Would later bring understanding and even controversy.&nbsp; Many say that Christianity has caused many wars and battles.&nbsp; Bloodshed.&nbsp; However if you really research you will know that out of the thousands of people who were massacred that day in Jonestown.&nbsp; There was not one Holy Bible found.&nbsp; A man&nbsp;bent on his own vision.&nbsp; Hios reflection was God but later became twisted by his own ideals.&nbsp; Many people have done this.&nbsp; I believe many people who have left Christ have also done this as well.&nbsp; As well as those who have been called but are not answering.&nbsp; Our own ideal of God is not even HALF as powerful as the truth found in the scriptures.&nbsp; Never will there ever be a mans perception of God more miraculous more powerful and more true then that which is inscribed in the scriptures of the Holy Bible.  Here is what Paul Pleads Ephisians 4:17&nbsp; So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 18. They are darkened in their understanding and seperated from the life of God becasue of the ignorace that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19. Having Lost all sensitivity so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. 20.&nbsp; You however, did not come to know Christ that way. 21. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the TRUTH that is in Jesus (Here is the key) 22. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by it's decietful desires. 23. to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24. to be made new in the attitude of your own minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteuosness and holiness.  Look and see that even as an intellectual or one who decides not to change their thinking and their past and their culture what Paul again warns.  Colossians 2:8 See to it that no one take you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition&nbsp;and in basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. 9. for in Christ all the fullness of the Diety lives in bodily form, 10 and you have been given fullness in Christ who is the head over every power and authority.&nbsp;  So with the Negative of the world comes basic understanding of their principles.&nbsp; Though being attacked, accused or any other type of attack or even their perception is skued by this. The world is based on tradition.&nbsp; Which is why is does not change. It sole reason to exist it not to change in is foundation.&nbsp; Since traditon sets to the playing field for princliples, and behavior ANTI is the only thing that can get through.&nbsp; So blatant disregard is the only allowable force now instead of change we have decay.  So simply by knowing Gods purpose and plan is our lives can we begin to realize that we have a higher purpose that does not appeal to the standards of the world.&nbsp; Likewise our lives will not appeal as well always.&nbsp; However if we are in the will of the Father like Paul and many other deciples we will have favor with God and Man.  Know this that when you have Nagativity coming against you for your choices or your life that many times it comes from the opposition of what God is doing in the lives of the people of this world.&nbsp; We as people have been given the opportunity to bring that plan into full circle.&nbsp; Literally Soldiers in a war.&nbsp; Every war has an opposition.&nbsp; Sometimes they can be our own families or friends.&nbsp;   Stand tall and use the Negativity of others as your Catapult into a more succesful life that later will bring shame to those who did not know or understand.&nbsp; And know that if there is a powerful force against you.&nbsp; The will of the Father is being done.  I end today with this  PROV 14:12 There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

						   There is tale of much not said of those who cried and those who plead  of those who walked and those who marched  Of those who fought and held their ground.   There is a tale a brave and lost  of those who thought and then forgot.  Of those who knew but never walked  Of those of watched and never talked  Of those who heard and never listened  Of those who cried, but never spoke.   There is a tale of those who knew  The answer shown upon their hearts.  There is a tale of people lost  Of deadned minds came with a cost.  Of people choice but never made  Commitment never stayed.   The Faithful and the Faithless  Shall be forever known that one is one  and one cannot be another and be the other one.

						   I walked another block today and heard a cry from along the way  in sadness I heard the cry of pain a suffering and lies of old bloody stains.   I turned around only to see people chasing after me.  Taunting, laughing, shouting aloud.  Obsenities, oblivious and proud.   I fell upon my knees and prayed that  shelter, comfort, love would stay.  I cried aloud again and said.  "Lord help me in your special way"    "Deliver me Lord on this day"  "Open the heavens" hear my cry.   Again I heard no reply.  I prayed some more  "Father do you hear?"   As On my knees I cried in fear.   "Lord do you hear me in my pain?."  "Do you hear me in my sorrow?".   Just then a burst a kind like voice  said ..."Relax my son,&nbsp;there's always&nbsp;tomorrow."

						   Today was an eye opening day.&nbsp; I went to church as I usually do and a heavyness was about the air.&nbsp; Something that was there but for some reason could not be lifted.&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear to tell you that I did not pray for it to go away.&nbsp; I knew that though it was heavy it was there for a reason.&nbsp; There is a time in my life coming up where there will be things seriously required of me.&nbsp; I knew this because the feeling is a level of urgency to get right in my life what needs to be right.&nbsp; I have this level of weight that is on my shoulders that I believe is issues that have been left without taken a second look.&nbsp; Perhaps there has been a missing link that I left long ago that I must pick up again.&nbsp; I really am not sure all I know is that this life that God has called me to is more than Just life.&nbsp; I is a life for others and not for myself.&nbsp; Though my pain might be great at times it will show those around me who need something.&nbsp; That yes even the lowly can acomplish all things through Christ.&nbsp; I remember my Pastor told me that one day I had a poverish mentality.&nbsp; A Mentality that kept me from the Glories of&nbsp; God because I had no wish to spend money on important things.&nbsp; This I traced back to my family life.&nbsp; I have always been told to be frogul with my money for this I feared spending it and therefor did not and have not.&nbsp; This mentatlity has not helped me in anyway.&nbsp; One must spend money to make it.&nbsp; Money however is not my goal now.&nbsp; My goal is success.&nbsp; Not to have a sucessful life.&nbsp; For what success would I have if merly meant having a nice&nbsp;car, nice house and a happy family.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would surly bring Joy to me.&nbsp; NO!... My joy comes from that which I can give to others and from it GoD has abundantly given to me the things that really matter.&nbsp; Money...No...Home...Not really...Car..kinda...These things are all what the world wants.&nbsp; Many have this and lack another, some have both...they have been truly blessed.&nbsp; However some just have one.&nbsp; I have more than just life.&nbsp; I have something so remarkable to explain it in words would be bragging and I wish not to do that.&nbsp; What I do however want to say is that I really do not have much however I feel like the richest man in the world sometimes.&nbsp; Many times that I do not&nbsp;think that I have&nbsp;I fret I am thinking my old way.&nbsp; There is an undertanding that God has given me that cannot be replaced by money.&nbsp; There is a faith that God has given me that cannot be replaced by money.&nbsp; Here is the Kicker I know God want me to be something I know that God wants his people to be sucessful and even prosperpus.&nbsp; However now is not my time.&nbsp; Children with Silver spoons think it a game.&nbsp; I do not want to be a Child of God playing a game I want to truly know how it feels to fight this battle.&nbsp; I have and I am learning.&nbsp; This is what Paul meant by with ever trial and tribulation he would praise the Lord.&nbsp; For he knew the Great works God was doing.&nbsp; This is not just me.&nbsp; This is all believers and their trials.&nbsp; All situations.&nbsp; All pains.

						    My friend I stand in judment now  and feel that your to blame somehow     On earth I walked with you by day  But never did you show the way  You knew the Savior and truth and glory but never did you tell his story     My knowlegede then was very dim.  You could have led me safe to him  Though we lived together here on earth    You never told me of the second birth  And now I stand before eternal hell because of heavens glory you did not tell.

						   I have unfortunatly found myself stuck in a place I did not want to be.&nbsp; However in what God wants I will deliever.&nbsp; I have just sat through the teaching of Ray Comfort.&nbsp; At least 2 hrs of Biblical Evangelism training and it is now. 5:07 AM.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cannot understand as of yet if I am tired.&nbsp; However I know for sure that I am excited to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to people.&nbsp; I have realized that in my pain and in my sorrow and in my situations I too have forgotten the Great Commission.&nbsp; I believe that I am called to be an evangalist. I do believe that despite my inequites and my situations that I have been called for this nobel thing.&nbsp; The word of God calls it a Nobel task.&nbsp; And the word of God also Calls ALL saint (those set apart) to be those who spread the Gospel.&nbsp; I do not think I am special.&nbsp; However as a Soldier in training I know my Sword is dull.&nbsp; My helmet could use some shining.&nbsp; By belt sometimes lets my briches fall down and my chest plate my need to be reordered via EBAY.&nbsp; Not that I am not in shape but who can be ready?&nbsp; It is a large world? Many problems?&nbsp; Many issues?&nbsp; How can I do this.&nbsp; After listening I have realized that YES it is a great task.&nbsp; However the task is not mine.&nbsp; It is my Lord and Saviors.&nbsp; I have been given the opportunity to be a part of it.&nbsp; If he is all knowing?&nbsp; All powerful?&nbsp; What do I have to loose.&nbsp; I am most defintly on the winning team.&nbsp; If I win in one thing.&nbsp; Let it be obedience.&nbsp; For Obedience is better than Sacrafice.&nbsp; If I am to win in anything I know that the sure way to win no matter what is to be on the team that makes and created the rules.&nbsp; Father God where to now?&nbsp; Still training but never too late to get my feet wet.

						   Sometimes when things are very hard is it very difficult to see the light in the darkeness.&nbsp; The Lord sometime wants us to look hard and long and see what it is we really have.&nbsp; I thank the lord for brining me friends and a church family who has been there regardless of preference.&nbsp; The Lord can only change people like that.&nbsp; The art of caring can only be done when the person actually wants to care unconditionally.&nbsp; This kind of care only the Lord can show and can administer to his people.&nbsp; Thank you Lord for your purpose and your plan.&nbsp; I am in a dark place right now and your light is so bright I just have to ignore the ploy of the enemy to have me focus on the negative instead of the positive.&nbsp; I am alive,&nbsp; I still have not turned from My father in heaven.&nbsp; I have a roof over my head.&nbsp; I still have my daughter and more importantly I have the Joy that only God can give to his people. Thank you, Thank You, Thank You.  Even when tears come I know that they are for a short while.&nbsp; In eternity I will be jumping for joy singing songs and ready to serve as I am now regardless of the price that needs to be paid.  I had a painful headache yesterday where I could not sleep a wink.&nbsp; I threw up in a toilet crying out to God to help.&nbsp; I sometimes ask myself if it was not for the pain for the struggle and for the situations would I still cry out.&nbsp; I honesty probably would not.&nbsp; I am a vunerable man of God.&nbsp; I will never quit.&nbsp; I will never stop.&nbsp; Those who have thrown accusations will feel shamed and those who have believed in me, their faith will be increased.&nbsp; I know I can do this.&nbsp; It just sometimes is harder for some.&nbsp; I am no victim.&nbsp; I am a soldier.&nbsp; Soldiers cannot be victims.&nbsp; I rufuse to quit though my body and my flesh wants to.&nbsp; My spirit says.&nbsp; Lord show me the way.  Thank you Lord for this Life. Thank you Lord for My Daughter. Thank you lord for the Body of Christ. Thank you Lord for the Sprirt you have given me. Thank you Lord for my Church Thank you Lord for the Friends you have sent me. Thank you Lord for my Life. Thank you Lord for your Plan Thank you Lord for Sustaining me.  Many people do no realize.&nbsp; I guess because far too many of them have everything they want already but it the lowest of the Gods people who know what it means to have Grace, to have Mercy to have Love and to have his Blessings.&nbsp; Even the Smallest of them recognize and know that all things come from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

						   While waking this morning "We are the forbidden examples of our Acts" Echoed through my head.&nbsp; Upon hearing I asked myself.&nbsp; What does this all mean?&nbsp; What does forbidden mean?&nbsp; what Example?&nbsp; And whats acts.? I had to reflect on my Life in christ and even outside of Christ over 2 Years ago.&nbsp; What ulimatly are we an example of in Life?&nbsp; As I was told just recently you are acting like you don't believe?&nbsp; At first I have to admit I was taken aback.&nbsp; Me..?&nbsp; Mr Christian boy pure and un touched.&nbsp; yeah right! I actually felt this way.&nbsp; But sometimes we need to really look and see what it is being said to us.&nbsp; If I am a Christian and I live a life other than the example that God has given or if I feel as though I am special for any other reason other than I am a Child of God. Then Pride is the issue.&nbsp; If I know this or the sin that inhibits me&nbsp;than action or taking action would be my issue.&nbsp; I was even recently told today "It is always the same old story with you.&nbsp; Sometimes people think you are a joke!"&nbsp; That one hurt also.&nbsp; But the word of we are an example of our forbidden acts or action brought all of it together.&nbsp; What are we in christ if not an example for christ.&nbsp; Can we be an example of Christ if we are doing the forbidden things that God has called forbidden.&nbsp; Can we steal and be an example for christ.&nbsp; Can we Lie. Can we Hate?&nbsp; Can we commit adultry?&nbsp; The answer is plainly no.&nbsp; Do we do these things in our christian walk.? Yes we do.&nbsp; But what ultimatly are we an example to the unsaved for what our most forbidden act is?&nbsp; It is like when you get a white cloth and a speck of dirt shows from 10 feet away easily.&nbsp; being purified by Christ makes our most forbidden of sin become our most prodominant part of our character.&nbsp; This is what the scriptures say when we are told to guard our hearts closely so that we may not sin against our Lord God.&nbsp; If we Believe and we know our Lord and savior do we not also know that our example will one day be taken account for?&nbsp; We are not all perfect and Christ is all who has been perfect but the effort the faith to be like him must be exhibited in our lives otherwise what do the unsaved have to look to when the Saved are living, acting, talking and Disbelieving in the same way?

						   I am realizing just as things continue on in this life I have been given. Christianity in general is a package deal. We don't take one thing and leave the other.  Just recently while having a Potluck. I saw the body come together. Each of us with our own agenda However God made it his agenda for us to be there. Time was spent. Breakthrough and ultimately fellowship came. We sometimes think we can turn and turn off what God has given us when ultimately he is the Lord and&nbsp;has appointed us to live our lives free but slaves to his will. I said yes. When I said yes I say yes to all things. Not just to what pleases me. When the Body meets we meet. When the lord says go to the nations we go. Like a child looking to their father. We must learn to be obedient to his voice as well as his plan. Though we may not know his plan following his voice will ultimatly lead us to his plan.

						   We all appreciate&nbsp;the small times we are with the ones we love however God sometimes breaks in and says we are to love one another as I have loved you. (Thank you Nick for that one). Well yesterday evening I spent some time with Sally the mother of a friend of mine, I was astounded of the Joy that God had shown me. Her Salmon was great. A meal fit for a King. Also To speak with her and see the Glory that is god living in the lives of those who rarely can show their light to others. I realize sometimes that like Sally there are people who are hidden from the world but not from the face and the ear of God. Even when we cannot get out. If we are basically prisioners of our own home. Our own choices or of our own soul The lords sees through al andl sees the heart and will deliver us. Such Joy the Lord has brought me. In helping me understand the meaning of Shining bright even when noone is around to see the light.   Thank you again Lord for this great experience in taking part in your journey even when I am so wretched a man as I am!

						   Dudley Daniel - Founder of NCMI (New Covenant Ministies International) has a great book that he wrote on the problem of the church and leaders as well as I believe people in general.  The book focuses around the problem that we fight battles that many times were not intended for us to fight.  That many times we come into a situation or problem and try duking it out on our own without consulting GOd.  The problem with this is that we loose out and many things that GOd has intended for us are lengthened and therefore it takes longer to get where we need to be.  This is what it means by choosing your battles wisely.  We must realize many times we cannot save the world and most importantly that we cannot please everyone all the time we must also come to terms that we will offend some and some may not like us for various reasons.  This if we are living in love and sprirt of Christ should not be a concern of ours.  When jesus was accused of being satan in Mark and when he was captured and spit at.  He did not spit back.  Why?  Because he had a purpose and plan and knew that he must follow the ways of his father so that his death would not be in vain.  The Father has purposed everything through his son.  Being the Son was the God in the Flesh.  So.  In being all this it is easy to see that the Lord himself did not involve himself in things he was not called to deal with.  Why not us as well.  The Lord spoke "It is finished" upon his last breath on the cross.  This signified that all was done and his will was done.  The idea that the Lord himself did not involve himself in many situation and took no haste in situations that he knew were in control.  For instance the fact that Jesus waited Days before going to heal Lazarus after he heard of his death.  The Lord knew that time would not matter and as he spoke upon healing.  He waited do that his glory would be shown.  Lazarus was basically confirmed dead and all rituals had been performed that man could solidify that he was indeed dead so that his rise from the dead would be more miriclous and show the healing power of our Lord and savior,  Whom which time has not matter.  So being the children of GOd we realize that we have a purpose and plan and many things arguments situations and problems are not ours always to fight.  I am not saying to be a pacifist.  What i am saying as a famous General once said.  Save the bullets for the real war".  The lord himself in his nature was not a pacifist but as Jesus a man of change (not of himself but of that around him), patience, kindness understanding and authority.  We must realize that when we argue or fight about pety things that the enemy is trying to have us focus on things that are less important so that he can get past us and cause confusion in our camp.  The ememy for those not christian is the Devil (Satan).  The one who sould purpose is to Seek, and Destroy all in his path.  However he may.  Don't loose the battle by fighting with your own soldiers or fighting a battle that your Commanding Officer (GOD) has not called you to.  It is difficult for me as well.  I simply can say that a majority of all my issues and problems were brought by not understanding this sooner.  Also that when God speaks to you.  You better listen.  The Lord is full of Grace and Mercy for those whom he loves and has chosen which by biblical word is all of humanity conditional of only accepting the death and diety of the Son (Jesus Christ). (If you have any questions (Watch the Passion or even more importantly dust of your bible and read it.  Ask the Lord to give you understanding and let him work in you and you will see the GLory that is Him.

						   It seems there is another Chapter being written in my life.  I do not know how to explain it but it seems that through loosing my wife gaining my daughter and forgeting resposibilites I have found that the old way of doing things is not working. As God has purposed me for If I continue doing things the old way I am going to loose ground soon.  I know however that though this may be very difficult indeed to face.  I am going to have to face various things that I have let go that need immediate attention.  This is the chapter being written. "Things to Be Done"  This time however the meaning of DONE needs to follow through with what Christ meant by "It is Finished" There must be no reason to track back to the past from which I came.  I must take care of all past issues and bury them.  That way they can never return back to me and I cannot return back to them.  As in Elisha I must burn my PLOW.  Why it has taken so long to realize this I do not know but It comes to me to understand that I best do something about it becasue writing about it does not accompish it simple set something up for accomplishment.  Will I finish this time?  I Pray the Lord that I do.  I do feel an energy that is rocketing me about getting things done.  Taking care of unclosed issues and the energy is not my own.  I know that God is on my side.  Now I simply must show him that I care enough about this and his plan to make sure it is done his way and not my own.

						   Lived A Life in An Old Broken Down House, And a corner that was devoted to the family mouse  A Bed broken down and springs worn, Ragged shoes and a shirt thats torn  Remember your the times you fought and they rung the bell?, And the babies that were born and then you sell.  The people don't rmember when your so lame And the babies born with silver spoons think it's a game.  Need a place to live! Need a place to sleep! To shelter us from the creatures that creep!  Need a place of protection  Free from rejection  And full of affection we seek  The Voice Within 1996

						   Today was my third baptism in water.  I have very seldomly felt the way I do now.  I really to be honest with you feel very at level.  Almost at Zenith of what God has called me to.  I upon listening to a word given to me realize that I have had the grace and the love from God to do the things I have needed I simply was afraid because I believed more in my hands then in the hand of God.  I feel at a stand still in my life like I need to be doing something but that thing has yet to be clear.  I remember hearing a saying that said. "Many times we look for a new horse to tend when the old is running ragged and has not been washed" In otherwords maybe I am not moving forward because issues of the past have yet to have been dealt with.  I thought for a moment what an awful God.  Then realized that in his nature he does not want to pile us with more than we can handle so we must deal with the things that God has told us before we can continue into the new of what God can or as we sometimes thing GOd should give us.  This is what the Baptistm was for.  I came to the Baptism as a spectator dressed in my clothes.  And as the Baptism opened I felt the lord as GO! GO in.  I asked "Why" The lord showed me through the prothetic that the old tools were no longer working.  I thought about the old tools.  Rusted many times old tools can cause more pain than good and many times using old messed up rusted tools can make a task take twice as long as it should normally.  The tools that I am using the way that I have aphttp://livingforjesus.blogspot.com/proached the things of my life are not benificial at all for me.  The lord has rebirth a desire to do away with the old and embrace the new.  As in our walks daily we all must.  In my wretched self that I would like to always think more highly of than I ought.  I think how simple all of this might have been if I would have taken these steps before.  Then I also realize and know that God knows what I am going to do before I do it.  I do not have a cruel task master but a kind loving and authorative father that must have his will before my own.  My true happiness relies on it and so does my salvation.  God has always had the door opened for the change but my desire to do business as usual was far easier.  Sometimes I do believe that is a lie from the enemy himself.  I look back and think how much easier it might have been If I would have just listened to you from the start Lord. Ahhh...God is the God of Second third and forth chances but there is only ONE life and after that there is no more. The truth hurts.

						   It has been some time since I have made a entry.  I suppose it is because of the questions that was asked just this Last sunday from a person serving some of the guys from my church at a Resturant.  The question was "Why do you go to Church?"  Now you would think a bible believing person would be able to answer that question easily however I challenge you to try it?  Upon more times of reviewing this question for now what has been around 3 days or so.  I have realized why this question is so difficult to answer.  First is challenges the Sunday ritual of our Faith.  Or does it?  First why do I go to church?  If the Church is me?  We are the Church.  THose who a does it?  Those who are called by God (Saints = set apart).  Scriptures such as do not forsake the gathering of the saints. or Iron Sharpens Iron.  Or they gathered daily, worshiping praying and breaking bread with eath other in the temple courts and gathered even more frequently as the day approached also could be used.  But are they not others words.  Are not the action that man do also driven by other things as well.  After thinking about this I realized that one does not have one given reason why they do anything.  Much less attend a church.  Or for the sake of not wanting to sound religious.  Gathered at a place in which to Worship Our Lord.  I will say I attend church for one main reason.  I love to worship the Lord and learn more about him daily.  So on Sunday I actually set that time aside just to do that.  However Monday through Sat I also attend church as well.  It is the testifying, witnessing and walking in the Light that God has given me.  Shy a few days here and there from the hunanity that I am.   Serving the Lord  I do enjoy to serve the lord.  I do however say that with a reserved thought in the back of my head.  ANy and all the time.  No ..Truly sometimes serving the lord can be gruling and testing.  It is not always a joy in and of itself.  However the Lord has a way of enabling you to do the difficult and many times come through with a lesson that is learnt.  I hope you understand that there are most definatly pratical reasons why we go to Chruch.  If we give a spritual reason for those who do not know Christ will they understand or will they listen..will they attend.      Why does someone attend a basketball game.  Go to a soccer game to go see their kids play soccer.  Go to the local club every certian day. A bar or certain gathering place every night or specific night.  I have observed 3 reasons.  Obligation and Expectation.  If you love your child you go and watch him play.  You want to be involved in his or her life. If you have friends and want to keep them you will occasionally or ritually pick a certain day to gather or meet with them.  If you do not however love your child (which is possible today) you would attend out of obligation or exspection and in the same case as with a friend at an event weekly, biweekly or monthy yearly so fort.  However many people believe that the church has become to same type of gathering.  Sadly many people do exhibit and believe this.  However as in a child.  If you claim to love God would you not want to be involved in his life.  His plan and his purpose for your life?  God and the Bible are not always easy to understand when you try and meet with him just in your home.  This is why the Bible says Iron sharpens Iron.  If I never attending an event with friends, went to a baseball game with my child and only heard of them in short burst of coversation would I know my child.  If I never gathered at all with my child would I even have a relationship with them other than the functional realtionship of being his or her parent.  Or the functional relationship of being so and so's friend.  The problem comes with the misunderstanding of the defintion of friend, parent and of what a true friend is.  What defines unconditional love and what defines a church.  The problem is people treat church as a functional occasion or ritual to pay the man for a ticket into heaven.  Eternity Insurance.  However what church is or the defined reason for Church is to be built up, grown if you will, taught, instructed and planted firmly into the life of Spirit of God so that one might both walk with understanding so that other might see the light through them an be saved.  This is why Bible + nothing Bible - Nothing is essential to a strong church and strong body.  I do believe that the BODY of christ as interpreted in the NIV is exactly that.  A body.  The only place to feed the body would be through worship and through exalting that which created you.  Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Son of God.  If you do not feed the Body that you today live in what will happen?  If I refuse to eat I will die.  If I refuse to drink I will wither away slowly.  I will dehidrate.  First with Dehidration comes weakness,  The mouth becomes dry, Vision is lost,  Your body begins to cramp up and eventually if you do not take care of the issue your body will begin to reject food and water all together and you will die.  Use that the illustration for Gathering of the Saints (church) one must drink.  As humans we do not all drink and those of us who daily live in the spirit need to come to gather so that those that do not can learn and we can learn from them.  God does not teach us and bare fruit in us so that we may eat of it of ourselves.  I challenge you this.  I you love God.  Then go to where he has asked you. Worship him as you have been created for.  Love him as he has asked so that you might learn to Love others.  Is Church the Answer? No...A Relationship to Christ is.  However how can one have a relationship with A Christ if one does not visit him in his dwelling place as he has asked?I rememeber attending a Logic class in my days of college.  The instructor was dicussing the validity of a true existing God.  His claim was that God did not exist becasue if he did he could touch see and know him.  I very puzzled realized that for logician that he was the answer was very illogical.  I asked him if he knew who Calvin Clower was?  He said to me "NO" and stumbled in his voice "Who...what do you mean?"  I replied "Calvin CLower..don't you know him."  He replied "I do not understand and do not know where you are are going with this?..."  I seeing the opportunity of using Logic to deconstruct his argument.  Said "Calvin Clower lives in my neighborhood he is a living human being"  I said like Jesus you have never visited Calvin so you do not know him.  However I assure you if you come to my neighborhood you will understand that he does exist.  However you have not so to you he does not exist."  I assure you with confidence that I know, talk and visit him he does.  However until you come to my neighborhood I could not prove to you otherwise.  I could show you his Driver license or Birth Certificate.  A Historcical Document.  However since you say the Bible is not a Histrical document even though it has never in over the 1000 years of its first authgraph has never been disproven.  Your desire not to look at this document as being valid as led you only to believe he does not exisit."  The Church. The Body of Christ is the Lord's dwelling place.  I will assure you so is my bedroom.  My car and sometimes pratically anywhere else.  However only through me and my father in heavens connection that I learn to improve and refine through attending with saints at a place of worship is that all possible.  So I say Church is the source of the things of God.  Much like why I am the Church.  However once my ideals become skewed because I no longer attend.  Have not sharpened my sword.  THe Lord I serve no longer becomes the true Lord but a made up idol of a God that I thought was but never was.  Something of my own imgination not biblical because as a human being that I am.  I become rusty.  Picture one LARGE Pool and smaller Pools of Water.   The Large Pool is the Church (Gathering Place of the Saints) the smaller pools are the people of God.  If the Ground dries up or if the Large Pool is what feeds the smaller Pool what occurs if the  Larger Pool dries up.  The Church is like a Directory List at a Mall.  We all have issues.  Marriage, Love, Sex, Morality issues, Leadership, Parenting.  Well the Church is like that Mall Directory List sending you to the right places so you don't wander or grow tired.  It is not place with the answers but a place in which you can learn the locations of answers so that you are not going by man made rules that change twart and twist but God set values that never change.  This enables you to live a life that is for The God you serve and worship thereby making your life fruitful in him.

						   I recently had a friend a very close person to my father and myself come to realization of her first love. She was excited.  You could hear the tears in her eyes as she recieved a phone call reinforcing her spiritual insight of what God had called her for.  I sometimes scratch my head when I hear and see things like this.  I am reminded of when we drive along a highway during the night.  I remember when I went across the U.S. with my grandparents how the light would reflect from the cars around and the streetlights just for a moment and how you could watch the light travel through the car then twist as it hit the edges of the shape of the interior of the car.  Trying to read or find something on the floor is almost impossible.  The glimmer of light is not peace to anyone.  As a matter of fact it can be captivating and even at times as I remember as a young child it almost putting me to sleep.  Like the pitter patter of rain the repetitivness of the light billiowing through the car and the sound of traffic and the wage of the force of the car turning around.  Stopping and turning again.  The Glimmer of light is so quick so light that nothing can be completly seen.  Nothing can hold attention.  The focus is usually on the light itself other than whatever you are trying to do.  I do not know why I am inspired to write about this but I do feel that it is a very good illustration of our lives as people.  Many times we are happy with the glimmer of light but all the light allows us to do is focus on the light and we cannot see our environment the things around us.  THink of the times you were driving and were fighting with the seatbelt late at night as you twisted to find something you needed behind the drivers seat.  There is never enough light and there seems never to be enough slack on the seatbelt. Our lives are like this.  Many times we see enough light that we fail to continue looking for the light or fail to see what is going on around us.  It is true blindness.  It is truly a difficult situation.  I am a bible beliving christian that believes only in the scriptures some might say that has limited my scope but I believe that it has broadened it.  The Art that I once found so captivatiing I know realize is not art at all and have found that the art many times lies within the kingdom of God.  Many artist might argue with me.  Many intellectuals might question this line of belief.  But I believe that God. His word the Bible are the source of what we call or least what should be called art.  Artistic is what God has made.  Would not the worship of the artist be more important that the art itself.  Many artist so profound have their art work and within the title theirs name exist.  Like Picasso's Cafe Terrace or Mozarts 5th Symphony.  Why not God. Jesus CHrist our Lord Savior and Creator Earth. My desire to create a documentary has not died but grown that this world has far too much evidence of Prophecy being fulfilled.  That is would destain the Word of God and Up Hold the Shallow words of In God We Trust.  A nation that is built on the very foundations of Jesus Christ now has decided to turn on the very foundations that made this nation the nation that it is or was at one time.  We are nearing another election and people are more interested in a president that has people thoughts and desires to mind then what is right?  Does this sound wrong?  George W. Bush might have been a man of many things long ago but can not man stand up brush himself off and make a difference.  I have very much respect in a man that regardless of what it might do to his POLITICAL IMAGE stood up for what was right and was very unpopular.  Many people are antiwar but want change.  Do they not realize that change of some time takes a great stand.  Like Rosa Parks decision not to go to the Back of the Bus.  A stand that indeed could have if given the right circumstances led to violence and even bloodshed.  In a nation as large as ours is it not right to know that there cannot be no change without Radical change which in facts does require the onslaught of war.  The truth comes again that we are happy as a nation with a GLimmer of light but when the decision comes to break down the wall and let the light show indefinatly there is a desire to keep that from occuring.  Like Children this nation is not realizing or knowing what in fact is needs only knowing what it wants.  This nation is happy with it's ideal that God is "The man upstairs" "The all powerful being" "The unknown" "The Higher Power"  If there be one Blasphomey is would be this selfish blinding look and vision of who God our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is.  I hope I do not come across to stong but sometimes we must stand for what we believe what we say we do and how we show it many times are two differnt things.  I had a conversation with a young lady 2 days ago about the sumission of Wife and of Husband.  There was a clear anger towards this yet she believed in the Bible.  Does this make sense.  Can we accept one and not the other.  If it is needed do I need to worship at A Budish temple. Read the Bible and read the Moron Bible.  Does this seem right?  I am not trying t to stir up dissention but sometimes when the truth so strongly goes against the norm there is resistance.  Are you or even I happy with our small Glimmer of Light.  I am not do I look for those who have flashlights or would I rather if possible have possesion of the same light the sun had.  For that would bring a longer, stronger sustaing light.  So many people open their minds to Spiritualism and many other things the Bible warns us about thinking that we actually can attain anything from them.  The Bible is right.  We cannot.  Some people content the Bible is not logical.  I contend the exact opposite.  If there be any need be FAD it should be throught the teachings of Jesus Christ.  For then we might truly have the So called "Spiritual Freedom" "At peace with ones self"  What is it this nation and the people in it are seeking.  A replacement for the irreplaceable.  Can an idea replace God.  What foolishness we have become.

						   Okay so the storm has seemingly passed and as I waited for it to past I realized a few important lessons.  First being blind is no fun and puts you into a very venerable postion of simply trusting others as well as yourself.  I also realized that this is how most without Christ live.  Trusting in others and in themselves.  Hopeing they are doing the right thing.  I also learnt that my life very much is like this.  Am I trusting in God or in myself and in others.  Do I truly believe the things I proclaim.  If I do how come I do the things that take little effort and the ones that take a step of faith and are literally life changing.  How come I do not take the same brash steps in these.  Of course I can speak loudly and even evangalize to those around me without a wink.  Yes.  This has become easy but the things that count.  The step of faith that I am not so Good at.  Do I trust God for these same things.  Do I just go with the Status Q like everyone else.  I fear that I will always if I do not choose to Concecrate myself.  In other words I do not believe I will be able to make it in the Status Quoe this time around.  THere is someone of more requirement.  Something that I did not think I would have to do.  Now I am at the bridge.  Will I cross or turn?  I think James will turn.  On the other hand I know that the Jesus inside me will cross.  I must allow myself to be fully him to get through this otherwise.  I will surely perish.  It is hard to say and many people who do not understand may even fear what I have just stated.  But simply those without christ even those with Christ who do not trust in him will perish.  The weight of this life is too heavy.  We depend on things that unfortunatly will not lead us to eternal happiness.  So many even forget the simplistic of things.  I belive I have done this.  Father God forgive me.  I have realized that when in the Storm the Lord puts you in the Eye of the Storm.  I leterally have watched people swept up by it and taken away.  I very closly myself was there.  Sometimes I feel like the Lord is not there but this last bout has only taut me one thing.  Though we may think he is not there it is in the Storm that he is there the most.  I sometimes wonder what it might be without him.  I dread the thought.  I know sometimes I might sound overly optimistic or sometimes even pessimistic.  But what you must understand is that I do have trust in my Father in heaven but I am not so far from realism that I do not undertand that each and every step will be painful.  Will take me all.  Will require steps to be taken, situations to be overcome. Will require me to jump hurdels and will require loss and well as gain.  I am not so religious not so out of touch as to think it is all roses.  I know the task I have to taken does have an opposition.  I know that many of the situations I go through are caused by my own mistakes and sometimes Donkey like attitude.  I know one thing though.  As long as this takes.  My Father in heaven will come through and I will overcome all.  I have been set here to do the will of my father and to learn and to teach.  I know that I will go through much and much will be required.  I am no different that everyone else.  I require nothing special.  I am just another Solider in this eternal war.  Thousands. Millions have taken on the same task to show those who do not know.  To teach those who do not understand a wisdom that I know nothing of.  A love I cannot fathom a glory that cannot be undertood. The wonders of Jesus Christ The worlds Lord and Savior.

						   I have to say that these last 2 days have been quite difficult indeed.  I do not exactly know why but It get me to thinking.  Is this where you want me to be.  ALong with tragic situations.  I am now temporarly blind.  I have about 30% of my vision.  Why this has happened I am also unaware.  Anyone looking in might ask.  What is he doing to deserve this?  I really do not know.  Many times we can be a llight of widsom of Jesus and others sometimes we doubt ourselves why and where we are at in out lives.  I just hope this storm passes soon.
