      While I was sitting in my permanently dark gamer cave, enjoying the freedom known as not having to go to school for three months and reading entire webcomic archives just to have something´(Slightly) amusing to do, and the last page of MacHall appeared on my screen, I received a call from Anders who apparently had decided to save me from the clutches of boredom; Yes, a LAN party. And a long one it is. Here I am, on my last day, with bloodshot eyes and (Even more?) greasy hair from being completely depraved of sleep for the last 48 hours (twice) and this 5-day Jedi-academy/Battlefield Vietnam marathon is coming to an end. I was just about to plan my return to said Den without getting shot by the RIAA sniper that I'm pretty sure I can see on a rooftop across the street, when I thought of the Asylum. Lacking ideas for my escape, and anything better to do - I decided to fill the few of you who actually come here every once in a while in with a few of the cooler details.  My hard drive is humming tiredly, as my share is repeatedly raped (almost literally) by my two dear friends who apparently have discovered the beauty of Ren'ai (dating sim/visual novels which somehow incorporate romance and/or hentai) games and Love Hina episodes, whilst I harvest mp3 after mp3 from 11 of the thirteen Neon Genesis Evangelion CDs in existence... Ahh the sweet smell of burned plastic... Oh, crap... That's my hard drive...   Battlefield Vietnam, I've found, is an incredible game. It manages to be fun, but keeps the possibility killing 10 Vietnamese soldiers with nothing but a revolver (or the 'Clint', as we call it ^_-) - which is a feature I'd like to see in a few other decently fun games. Although Counter-Strike probably wouldn't make that much sense with Vietnamese people running around.  Joke aside; I'd say that this has been an incredible party, and apart from being bragged repeatedly at the Halflife Dragonball mod Earth's Special Forces (quite fun, actually. Especially counting the fact that DBZ is one of the most tedious and slow-progressing series in the history of mankind, only surpassed by "days of our lives". No comment needed. Yuck.) nothing has really been a problem. And that's quite rare in LAN parties. In fact, I don't believe it's ever happened to me before ^.^  I must bid you Sayonara for now, as the sounds my stomach is making clearly indicates that I might not have eaten enough toast yet. That, or I'll O.D. on bread and ham.

      "i am in a buried kennel, i have never felt so final, someone find me please, losing all reserve, i am fucking gone, i think i'm fucking dying."-Slipknot, Purity  Hello.   Everythings the same. everyone follows what someone else did before. and i know i'm not perfect, and i know you hate everything about me too...but. do you have to make it worse by pretending to care in the beginning?  I have lost many, many friends recently. Two of my best friends to each other. One of them i 'got back' but turns out that he just did it to be nice and really didn't care at all. but he wants to make sure i'm okay so he stays around. like he has to fix me.   Others, i only care about one other person to. this is very much not true...i love everyone and everything very very much. which is another desaster all in itself. i hate everything because i love it so much. apperently i'm like everyone else and only care about the one i love most in the world. not true. at all. but we all have our opinions. mine just doesn't matter.   i'm questioning my trust for certain people...they say i'm gonna die all alone because i don't trust them enough. well if they wouldn't hurt me, i would trust them...doesn't that make sense? *gags*  i'm in band camp. woo...i play flute in the CHS marching band...euu i sound all offical...or something. either way...shall be a great experience...most of the people there rock. so yeah.   Tonight i have a piano recidal. thing. i'm playing 'my heart will go on' yay?...it's the real version...12 pages, 4 sharps. *gags*. and i'm playing 'i'd like to teach the world to sing' on my guitar...trust me...that was so not my idea. i dont want to do this. it's not fair. but wish me luck anyway.

      Hello...   Caring about a person hurts a lot. I am a person who chose to care about everyone. so i feel other peoples pain and suffering because i decide to be compassionate. With that extra stress added on top of trying to be my own person while carrying on a relationship with someone a few thousand miles away and doing my homework...it ends in a lot of sleep.  Sleep is coping for me, it makes it all go away, but sometimes, just sometimes, i get to the point where i am dreaming such horrible dreams it doesn't help. I do not want to risk that tonight. Which is why i am up at one in the morning and i am dead tired.   I received a phone call tonight by a frightened soul.  I received a phone call tonight by a lost friend. I received a phone call tonight by a "completely out to lunch" person.  Tonight has been quite eventful, while trying to help these people i have to deal with feeling so -bad-. Well, i'll go to the doctors, they'll give me drugs, and i'll lose my personality. That's not so bad now is it?. of course it is. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "all i ever wanted was you, my love, you're all i ever wanted..."-HIM  -*deep breath*- I love warren. I love warren more than anyone. the world knows that. but i'm worried...his life story -scares- me. i'm always so worried about losing him to something and if ben and i's break up caused such a bad mental break down warren surely would. . .and i'm jealous of his ex-girlfriends cuz they weren't me...is that selfish?...is it bad that i fell in love with him and it took him a year to figure out that he loved me too?...i hope not. cause that just wouldn't be fair.  someone save me.   Anyone going to Mass.? if you are--take me with you.  Goodbye All. Sweet Dreams.

      Hello.   One of my best friends decided it would be fun to light a fire cracker in his hand. It blew up. Wow Ben, you ARE a genius.   People are -stupid-  "Main Entry: id·i·ot  Pronunciation: 'i-dE-&t Function: noun Etymology: Middle English, from Anglo-French ydiote, from Latin idiota ignorant person, from Greek idiOtEs one in a private station, layman, ignorant person, from idios one's own, private; akin to Latin suus one's own -- more at SUICIDE 1 usually offensive : a person affected with idiocy 2 : a foolish or stupid person"  -- Webster. ------------------------------------------------------------------  Now...  Yesturday was the talent show for my class (yeah we're 14 and still having talent shows.) eric, joe, and connor rocked. kudos. they played "detroit rock city", "walk this way" (wow), "crazy train", and a VERY shortened version of "stairway to heaven." all good.   Today we're going to the pool...wow...that's just plain not nice..."don't make me feel like that cuz that's just plain not nice..."-billy talent...okay watching too much grind. but who cares. tis a good movie. anyway...we're going to the pool, and everyone is whining about it and i'm like SUCK IT UP!...i brought my cd player with me...and my lovely cds...i feel the need to learn my whole slipknot cd while laying in the shade with a hoodie on to keep my pale-ness. but i probably won't. i might swim just to be -different-...at a pool field trip?? yeah how is that for weird.   Ahh hi missy! *waves* she's looking over my shoulder and laughing...am i really that funny?...deep.   Friends are grounded. i might have to search through piles of old stuff to find ash's phone number...i haven't heard from her in a while...warren's grounded too...but that seems like an every day occurance...*blinks*...yeah.  So this rant was not so much deep. I needed to get something posted...i'll try harder next time.  Goodbye All. Sweet Dreams.

      Welcome.  Hello All.     I Hate: Those of us (the human race) who believe that it is a necessity to make people feel bad because THEY cannot deal with their own lives.       (i will elaborate.)        This said person (who shall remain nameless) decided it would be fun to say that he *a drummer for a few months* is a better musician than me *a 4 1/2 year flute, 8 year piano, 3 year guitar player*...that bothers me. He also states that I cannot write music (more issues) and that i can't write lyrics (that also pisses me off.) . . . needless to say i won that battle because all he could think of to call me was a poser. wow. how unique.         Another person (also remaining nameless) has insulted me many, many times. And i FINALLY told her this, and she says i'm lying my insecurities on her...for telling her that i am annoyed with being placed in a position where i feel less important than the rest of the human race. yeah. sure.         People who are not able to live with being themselves so they have to criticize those of us who do...(i.e. wearing different make up and being a "Goth" therefore being ostracize. gotta love it.)    I Love: Those few people in the world who understand.     (no need to explain further)    Don't Leave Me: I have a huge fear of people i love leaving me. And that just goes with how i grew up. which is fine. okay. sure. but when i can no longer sleep to avoid the pain...that's pretty bad...    Today i was basically sitting in Spanish class almost crying because i couldn't deal being with -that- many people who i knew just DESPISED me. . . and i don't know why. but...i'll figure it out.

      *sighs* Hello All...           So. For all of you who thought i was dependant, obsessed, never would go through with it...etc. were wrong. i did break up with Warren. *sigh* i'm single. and it's sad...but i feel a little better...though the time we were on the phone was hell (no details.) and it made me feel horrible...but...that's how it went down...heh...            Writing more music, drawing more...just kind of a shallow feeling of calm.

       Hello All.                    Heh, He's home, and i was very very wrong...i guess i didn't want to/wasn't really going to break up with him anyway...but...damn if he reads this....but i still am confused...cuz i'd like to date someone physically -here- so that i didn't sit at home all the time talking to him on the phone! ... but no.   ------------------------------------------------------  I'm in like two bands now; when did this happen?    Colin calls at two o'clock this morning and is like 'do you play bass?' and i'm like uhh no but i can figure it out, why?  'cuz i want you to play bass in my band' ...uhh...okay?     so i hung out with Colin today. and played bass...twas interesting to say the least.    then i have my 'chick band' as i call it (we're all girls so far?) ha...and that's for my writing stuff cuz of COURSE they wouldn't let me play my shit, naw, it's not good enough for a death metal band!...bite me. nothings go enough for "you"  ------------------------------------------------------  The *new* Taking Back Sunday cd (where you want to be) comes out on Tuesday...and i'm excited...lol...even though, thanks to 'the leak', i've heard it all already...it's awesome beyond words...    ------------------------------------------------------  Wrote a new song...tis...well...normal. Too normal, drives me insane...but everyone likes it?....i hate conformity...really...    ------------------------------------------------------    "just ask the question come, untie the knot, say you won't care...say you won't care...retrace the steps, as if we forgot, say you won't care...say you won't care..."-New American Classic, Taking Back Sunday...

       Hello All,         Wow okay what's with the new "create a post" thing...what is that...why is it cool?....i'm scared...Anyway....      BAND CAMP! SUCKS! and i NEVER want to do that again...so i could quit....but i most likely won't...my new name is 'princess of darkness' because they don't know my name and i wear all black...and of COURSE i don't do everything right on the first try...but they really expect it that way. And, so, i got to sit on my ass from 1-5....that was GREAT fun...considering i marched/played standing up from 8:30-11:50...(hour for lunch there for the slower people)...so yeah...but Sabrina, Amber, and Anthony made it quite interesting (ahh good times having 10 grade friends.)      Life. Sucks. But i don't understand why anyone would want to die bad enough to kill themselves...too many young people have died this summer...Allyson, RIP....      And it just doesn't make sense to me, why someone would want to take their own life when others are dying for things that are not their fault...and i get to hear about it "oh i tried today" "oh i cut today" "omg i hate life so bad i want to kill myself...      A lot of people, including me, have stated one or more of these statements...but that doesn't mean it's any less sad....it's a trend. cutting is a trend. a ton of people do it...just to get attention. Granted that some do it for other reasons, but, i've seen too many people in institutions over the last year involving suicide attempts. And to anyone who has ever heard "I tried today." especially from someone you love, knows how much that hurts, or "I cut today." it just makes you want to hurt them and hug them at the same time. Try to tell them that life will get better...but they don't listen, i know they don't listen. But i always tell them. And I have dreams, that are almost as bad, when i wake up screaming from seeing one of my best friends just...dead....      I really...really...really wish the world wasn't this way....Marilyn Manson (yeah we're back on this again, if you've read my diaryland thing you know. i've gone on many rants) might have been right...in one of his videos "Coma White" he portrays Kennedy's death, Jesus, and the Day of the Dead (mexican holiday). And when he was asked why, because this video was SO controversial, he said it was about america's obsession with death, which is not completely false, and he has a point. (Hey, he IS a smart man, despite what all of you are thinking about him.)        "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent.

      Hello All.  Woo! Vans Warped Tour '04 kicked ASS. Cate and i got up at like 8:00...got ready, got food, and were on our way...around 12:10 we got there. We heard Billy Talent in the distance and got in the stadium just in time to see the end of The Casualties set, and for my mother to freak out because she thought we were going to get hurt in the pit (it looked really bad from where we were...) Then, after being yelled at and warned for what we had to do we decided "hey, Matchbook Romance is playing...then Sugarcult...lets go." So we went into the crowd and found Richard, Jena, and Emily (Cate's friends). The Matchbook Romance show was pretty good, and i was impressed by actually knowing what they were playing (how'd that happen?) Then Sugarcult came on, and the crowd decided it would be fun to rush the stage...unfortunately, we didn't know that was going to happen at that moment (nor did most of the other people) and we got into one big mosh pit basically. So Jena, Emily, Cate and I left...leaving poor Richard who seemed to have -way- too much fun in there. Then we went up into the stands and this guy (still am yet to figure out which member of the band he is...) is like "hey, i'm from a band called Facing New York, we can't play today but we're trying to get as many people to listen to us as possible" so we listened to their cd and bought them (got them autographed too) so...that was my good deed. Then, New Found Glory started playing after Sugarcult...I don't really like NFG personally, but i thought "hey, we're here, why not?" It actually was a pretty good show...and i knew a few of the songs...By this time it was 2:00 which meant one hour until Taking Back Sunday (omg i love them.) After NFG, Coheed and Cambria played...which we paid little attention to, got some drinks, and hung out in the shade...We decided that 10 minutes before the beginning of the Taking Back Sunday show we would push our way through the crowd (Cate is really good at that) We were like 20 feet away from the stage! Coheed and Cambria finished their set and now it was time for TBS to play!! Adam is SO sooo hott!! They Played; Set Phasers to Stun, Bonus Mosh pt.2, A Decade Under the Influence, One-Eighty By Summer, Timberwolves at New Jersey, and Cute Without the E. (maybe more but those are what i remember) I screamed EVERY word to EVERY song and couldn't really speak afterwards. But it was totally worth it! After they were done they introduced Yellowcard, Adam was like 'yeah, they have this song about an avenue, it's badass, i've heard it' lol...I want to see TBS the next time they come to Hershey. After the TBS concert, Yellowcard played...Cate had already seen them and i don't really like Yellowcard so we didn't really pay attention to them. So we went around, ate and drank more (it was really hot) and then went to buy things...Of course I bought a Taking Back Sunday t-shirt that has a heart with a skull and crossbones in it and says 'taking back sunday.' Then we listened to the other bands for a while and just walked around. (Tiger Army and then Lars Frederickson and the Bastards were playing) We were waiting for Story of the Year cause Cate wanted to see them. Then, while we were up in the stands (we had nothing else to do.) Anti-Flag started playing and did a really nice speech that was A: Anti-Bush and B: explained that the whole group of people at warped was equal and things like that, they were awesome. So we went down and watched the rest of their show and bought "Terror of the State". Then Bad Religion started playing...we got our arms spray painted (we had no idea what the symbol meant, but we were thinking it was snowboarding...) and it won't really come off...ha...Then after Bad Religion, Story of the Year started playing...I know like two of their songs and it wasn't all that impressive...But, a mosh pit formed right in front of us. So i was in the pit while trying to keep Cate and I out of it. (the dudes were huge) After that we went to buy Cate a Story of the Year shirt. The International Noise Conspiracy was playing, then Bouncing Souls (looking back on that, i wish i would've stayed and watched it.) Then we decided it was time to leave...haa we had been there for like 7 hours and i was dead tired. So we went to Wendy's for dinner. And then we came home and Cate and i watched tv and went to bed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning my alarm clock went off at like 9...so we got up and went to see Ben where he works cause he knows Cate and wanted to meet her, and i haven't seen him all summer...so we went in there and that was cool...haha...

      Hello All.      I have just returned from "camping."  Rather, we were staying in a not-so-much fun deer cabin, with no running water/plumbing (goes hand in hand doesn't it?).  First i walked in and i thought "Omg...it. . .smells...awful."  So i did the most logical thing, got out the insence i brought along, and i'm almost out of insence now.  Then, as we were unpacking, i find a lovely - dead - mouse.  Twas less than amusing.  Then after we got settled, dad and i decided, "hey, let's play checkers."  Then we realized- we don't remember -how-.   So we made up a few versions and decided that when we got home we would learn how to play.  Then, as a tridition, we had a Rummy (card game) tournament.  I believe my father won both games we played (with a million hands each, we go to 500 points.)   But i was close!  Then, after realizing that there was an outhouse, everything went downhill.  It rained.  No plumbing.  Nothing.  So we spent most of the time in the stinky little cabin, sept for when we were driving and i was car sick from sitting in the back seat.  Or when we were having target practice with the rifles that were brought along.  What an adventure. ------------------------------------------------------      I'm in like one or two bands.  One "death-metal" band where i'm their bassist, how complicated is that? it's not.  The other one is my "unnamed chick band" (soon to be not if we get that other guitarist to play for us, he is a guy) where it will be my baby and i will do most of the work.  Which is okay, as long as no one argues, cause when people start arguing, then...we have issues.  Other issues; Money. Where am i gonna get money for equipment and studio time, yeah, thats right, I'M NOT.  But my parents might.  Heh...or i'll just save ALL of my money thats in my bank account right now.  Artistic differences.  Chances are, jak and i will be doing one thing.  and court and anna will be doing another.  And that can cause problems.  Not to mention we need a bass player.  And to play shows, to make money, to make that demo, to become rich and famous and say BOO YA to everyone who thought we wouldn't...yeah...i'm too hopeful. ------------------------------------------------------     People.  Suck.  The ones who tell you they'll never leave you, leave and come crawling back.  Some of them just like to mess with you to see when you go insane.  Some of them just want to tell you all of their problems and then you take the blame and then it's all going to hell.  (For those of you out there who think i'm talking about you, i'm not.)  And i'm really really really tired of everything everyone else says.  I can't even think straight to finish this thing...ugg...i am so tired.  Goodbye All. Sweet Dreams.
