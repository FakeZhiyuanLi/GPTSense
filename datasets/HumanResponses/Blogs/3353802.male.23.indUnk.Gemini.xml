      Well, it's official. As of May 17, 2004, gay marriage is legal in the United States. On that day the state of Massachusetts, in accordance with the ruling of the state supereme court, issued the very first civil marriage licenses to same sex couples. The licenses are only valid for people who have established residency in the state of Massachusetts, however many out-of-staters are flocking to the state and receiving licenses anyway. Many gay rights activisits no doubt hope that they can legally force other states to recognize the validity of gay marriages contracted in Massachusetts. In response to this, President George W. Bush, egged on by the religious right and the social conservative branch of the Republican Party, has proposed the "Federal Marriage Amendment" (FMA) to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment states that marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman, and has been pushed by social conservatives, including National Review, for many years. There are several factors at work here, most of them bad. First of all, gay marriage should never have been legalized, at least not the way it was. The Justices of the Massachusetts supreme court unilaterally declared that the state's constitution forbids discrimination against gay couples in marriage law. This opinion is ridiculous. The Massachusetts Constitution was written and ratified in 1780. Are we to believe that men in 1780 were writing this document with the intent of securing the right of homosexuals to marry? They probably viewed homosexuality as a disorder, as did most people back then. You can make an intelligent argument that gay marriage should be legal; you can not intelligently argue that the constitution mandates it. Does original intent count for nothing? Are constitutions of government nothing more than legal puddy, to be molded by unelected courts to fit the fads and fashions of the moment? Gay rights activists realized that the people of this state and country were opposed to gay marriage and that hence they could not win through the democratic processes of the legislature. So their ideological fellow travellers on the court simply circumvented the will of the people.  As maddening as this is, President Bush's proposed amendment is also wrong. As columnist George Will has ably argued, one should not attempt to write social policy into a fundemental charter of government. The FMA does even more than the state court to take the question out of the hands of the peoples' representatives-it simply forbids all state recognition of gay marriage under any and all circumstances, period. Bush knows full well that the FMA will never muster the votes to pass-this is an election year sop to his religious right base. There is a very simple and sensible resolution. Pass a constitutional amendment to deal with the real problem. The real problem here is not gay marriage-it is meddling courts who usurp the powers of the legislature. Simpy pass an amendment that takes the issue out of the hands of the courts. Here's what the proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution should say: "Nothing in this Constitution, or in the constitutions of the several states, shall be construed so as to mandate the granting of marriages between persons of the same sex." It's that simple. And I belive that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) proposed a similar idea. However the religious right lost no time in shouting it down. They selfishly insist on an amendment that enshrines their sexual prejudices as the law of the land-thus dooming it failure. Too bad. Stay tuned for a post describing my views on gay marriage itself....coming soon.

      I suppose that those of you who have the stomach to watch it have already seen the video of U.S. citizen Nick Berg being savagly murdered by Islamic terrorists in Iraq. Most mainstream news media have not shown the entire video, for obvious reasons. I think its important for people to see it. I think it illustrates what I have been talking about. It shows the utter moral degradation of the people we are fighting. The video is very clear: Abu Musab al Zarqawi, one of the leading jihadists in the world, slowly saws this man's head off as he screams, blood gushing out. The thugs then gleefully hold his head up. All the while these animals are screaming "Allahu Akbar," "god is great." That's all these savages care about: their perverted image of god (I won't capitalize god when referring to the deity that they worship). It reminds one of the Palestinians playing around gleefully with the remains of Israeli soldiers that they murdered without honor. They are homicidal robots programmed to repeat a mantra, somewhat like those German bastards at Nuremburg. They are savages and their ideas and way of life are inferior to ours. It feels so liberating for me to be able to say that. At my synogogue this past Shabbat, my Rabbi said something very great, something that I wish all religious leaders would say. He offered a prayer for "Nick Berg, a Jewish American boy who was murdered by savages, savages whose god is no God." He also offered a prayer for the victory of American military forces abroad and their speedy and safe return home. I wish that kind of moral clarity were offered by all religious leaders in the U.S. Sadly however, most of the establishment of the Catholic Chruch, the mainline Protestant churches and Reform and liberal Judaism are hopelessly feminized and politically correct and would never stoop so low as to actually call evil when they see it and to pray for the triumph of good in the world. That would be much too offensive. I'm glad that the Rabbi pointed out what many others have failed to: the god worshipped by Islamic terrorists is not God. They are idol worshippers and fetishists just as bad as the ancient Caananites and Egyptians. (The mainstream Islamic establishment is of course even more cowed and indulgent of Islamic terrorists. Most U.S. Islamic organizations, such as CAIR, are in the hands of Saudi funded Wahabi clerics). This then is my conclusion: our society needs confidence. We need the guts to say the things that my Rabbi said or that Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister of Italy recently said. That we are better than Al Qaeda. And that when it comes to defeating Al Qaeda ANYTHING GOES. I was of course dismayed by the abuse shown toward Iraqi detainees by U.S. troops. However look at how much worse the enemy is. We at least have a moral compass and ashamed when our soldiers act wrongly. The "torture" that we subjected our prisoners to was hardly torture at all-it was more like a college frat hazing. However if those prisoners were bona fide al Qaeda members, rather then common Iraqi criminals, I would not have been as disturbed by those images. I think that a certain amount of mistreatment is fair game against al Qaeda leaders.  The bottom line is this: for the forseeable future our all encompassing national obsession has to be hunting down al Qaeda, ruthlessly and by any and all means necessary. I belive that President Bush has done well so far, but I also think that he is loathe to go "all the way." I don't believe that he has the guts to face up to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia should be on the State Department's list of terrorist sponsoring nations, right up there with Iran and Syria. Why isnt it? I submit this: that were it not for the Royal family's oil wealth and political and social connections with western elites, Saudi Arabia WOULD be on the list. We need a president who is willing to cut our addiction to Saudi oil. We have to bust up OPEC and BOYCOTT Saudi Arabia until we bring them to heel and they cease their sponsorship of terrorism. There was recently a telethon, (a TELETHON!) held  in Saudi Arabia to raise funds for Palestinian suicide bombers attacking Israel. Why didn't the U.S. send the Air Force to Saudi Arabia and bomb the telethon IN PROGRESS? Do I sound crazy? Are my ideas beyond the pale, stupid even? Do the smart people "in the know" laugh at me? Then i guess I must be a radical. I don't believe the world has to be the way it is. I think that we should be able to call a spade a spade, despite what the diplomats think, despite what that Arabists at the State Department think. Why did Bush censor those 27 pages of the 9-11 report pertaining to Saudi involvment in 9-11? Does the report show that one of the Saudi princes or officials in the Saudi government knew about the attacks, about what was coming? Perhas Prince Nayef? I would not be surprised. I actually asked Ari Fleischer, the President's former press secretary, about Saudi sponsorship of and incitment to terrorism and he actually told me with a straight face that Saudi Arabia is an ally of the U.S. in the war against terror. Why do we have to tolerate public officials who baldly lie to us on matters of life and death? Sometimes I feel as if the U.S. is holding back from fulling fighting al Qaeda because they know that a U.S. victory against al Qaeda would expose the extent of the involvment of elite Saudis in the terrorist network, and that would be bad for business. That would be bad for papa Bush and Jim Baker and all the rest. Something has to be done to radically change U.S. policy toward this evil crackhead of a nation we call Saudi Arabia. I'm tired of the Arab world claiming victim status just because Jews live in .001% of the middle east. The Arabs, Palestinians included, are not victims. They are the victimizers. President Bush can easily dispel these rumors-just declassify those pages of the 9-11 report pertaining to the Sauids. Expect more updates and rants about our "friends and allies" in Saudi Arabia on Matityahu Blog.

      Did everyone see Tom Friedman's colunm in this past Sunday's New York Times? In it, Friedman launches another one of his elitist attacks on Israel. Here's the all-knowing arbiter of elite foriegn policy opinion: "Question: What do the Shiite extremist leader Moktada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army have in common with the extremist Jewish settlers in Israel? Answer: More than you'd think. Both movements combine religious messianism, and a willingness to sacrifice their followers and others for absolutist visions, along with a certain disdain for man-made laws, as opposed to those from God. The big question in both Iraq and Israel today is also similar: Will the silent majorities in both countries finally turn against these extremist minorities to save their future"? Sadly, this has become typical of Friedman. His comparison is vile. Al-Sadr and his thugs are totally homicidal-that is, their goal is to kill as many people as possible in Iraq in order to spread terror and foment opposition to the Reconstruction. They are  murderers, Mr. Friedman. They kill women and children and anyone who gets in their way. The Jewish settlers may be extreme at times, but they don't go around shooting up babies or planting roadside bombs. The settlers' latest victory was won at the ballot box-when they convinced a majority of Likud party voters to defeat Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to pull Israeli settlements out of Gaza in a May 2 referendum.  There are certainly good reasons for people to oppose the political agenda of the settlers, as many Israelis do. However, to compare them to the very murderers who are out to kill both us and them is disgusting and sadly typical of Mr. Friedman. Friedman is a typical Arabist, anti-democratic elitist-just like his friends in the European Union. The European Union is legendary for the contempt in which it holds the people of the various countries of Europe-when they democratically express their opposition to the program of the Euro-elites (as the Danes and the Irish have recently done). Friedman has a similar attitude. The settlers embraced the democratic process and went house to house in an effort to convince Likud voters to vote a certain way. They played by the rules of a democracy and their efforts paid off. No matter to Friedman. He still believes that they are the equivalent of al-Sadr's terrorists-just because their opinions are not his own. Take note Mr. Friedman: the Mahdi army fights with bullets; the settlers fight with ballots. That is the great moral difference and that is why the U.S., though it may disagree, must respect the settlers. And that is why we must never rest until al-Sadr's evil movement is defeated forever. Tom Friedman's foppish career as a rather snotty enemy of Israel is far from over...stay tuned for more Friedman updates.

      Hey there everyone. Allow me to introduce myself....my name is Matthew Pecorino, but you can all call me Matityahu (or whatever else you want). I'm new to the whole "blogging" thing so bear with me.   This blog will be devoted to politics, philosophy, intelligent social commentary and the propagation of all that does rock. Here you will find analysis of the pressing issues of the day in terms of religion, public policy and social trends, with an occasional emphasis on Jewish affairs. You will find accurate information, but also forceful opinion.   We here (I use the royal "we") at Matityahu Blog present accurate information, but we also have a mission. We believe in a cause and in certain core principles. Since this is to be a webzine dedicated to politics and controversy, I herewith lay out our principles:  Matityahu Blog is devoted to the United States of America and the values and principles upon which this nation was founded.   We believe in political and social liberty and the defense of such liberty from all enemies foriegn and domestic.   We believe that the free market, competitive price system is the best, most moral and most equitable means of distributing society's resources.   We belive, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, that the government's task is to do for the people only those things that cannot be done, or cannot be done as well, by individuals.   We believe that at the present time the world is faced with a terrorist threat of dire proportions and that the United States must face this threat aggressivly...this means wipe Al Qaeda, and any states which support terrorism, off the face of the earth.  Finally we support Zionism, and the right of the Jewish people to live in peace and security in the land of Israel.  Well, there are my principles and the reason for this blog. Check back often and feel free to respond to anything you find here. Let the debates begin.....

      I got this email from a friend. Just thought it should be spread to the wider world:  To Kill an American  You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was  actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an  offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American.  So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an  American is, so they would know when they found one.  (Good one ya,  mate!!!!)  An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish,  Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican,  African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or  Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage,  Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known  as native Americans.  An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In  fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only  difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them  chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he  will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs  claiming to speak for the government and for God.  An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world.  The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of  Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person the  pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other  nation in the world in their time of need.  When Afghanistan was overrun by  the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to  enable the people to win back their country!  As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other  nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best  music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least.  The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired  and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless,  tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. Some of  them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001  earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the  World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures,  and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.  So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did.  So did General  Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the  history of the world. But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself.  Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place.  They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds  to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  Author unknown  Pass this around the World.

      For those of you who look at the current situation in Iraq and come to the conclustion that we were wrong to liberate that country from Saddam Hussein: here's some food for thought. If we had not invaded Iraq and overthrown Saddam, we would have had only two options: 1)maintain the status quo of containment and sanctions on Iraq. This policy was sucessful in terms of keeping the Kurds in the north semi-independent and of limiting Saddam's ability to invade other states. However it involved sanctions that were impovershing Iraq, and according to liberals (the same liberals who are now anti-war) were causing millions of Iraqis to starve. It also did not prevent Saddam from continuing to murder his own people; 2)or we could have just lifted the sanctions and allowed Saddam to have free rein to do whatever he wanted. That would have meant more untold suffering for the Iraqi people, especially the Kurds. Bear in mind that Saddam is a man who murdered hundreds of thousands of people and filled mass graves with their bodies. We know; we dug them up. The evidence is irrefutable. So clearly....the invasion and liberation of Iraq was the only truly moral option in terms of Iraq policy. This does not mean that the Bush administration has not messed up terribly in Iraq-they have. Bush and SecDef Rumsfeld terribly underestimated the number of troops we would need after the fall of Baghdad to keep the peace, stop looters, supress insurgents and reconstruct the country. It also looks like American officials were too close to Ahmed Chalabi-a globe-trotting shady Iraqi businessman who it now appears had unsavory ties to Iran. At least we corrected that mistake by dumping him like a bad habit and even raiding his HQ. Anyway guys, today's my birthday so I can't blog for too long.  I got a dvd player and a digital camera for my birthday. In the meantime check out this article from "Capitol Hill Blue":   http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4632.shtml  It has some sensible thoughts on Iraq-really puts things in perspective. Till next time.....
