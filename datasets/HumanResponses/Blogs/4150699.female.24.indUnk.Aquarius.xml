      I forgot!  At last! Somewhere I can share my sordid summer fiascos without fear of being found out! :) Well, for years and years, my friends and I have wanted to do this race called the "Bare Buns Fun Run."  As you can probably tell by the name, the race is held at a nudist colony and everyone runs naked!  Well, almost everyone.  If you finish the race naked, you get a special shirt that says "nude finisher."  If you chicken out, you get a regular shirt and tons of mockery from those who let it all hang out.  I was majorly into running in high school and college. My team was my life, we were all queens of the world, etc, etc, etc.  Running was a huge deal in my home town.  Hundreds of people would show up for high school races.  It was kinda a cultural thing.  A lot of famous runners came from my town or were somehow connected to my town later on in life.  Anyhow--- all of this to help you understand where I come from and why I would consider running naked time well spent.   You'll hear tons about my teammates, since they were a huge part of my wacky past, but I'll start by telling you a story about naked running. We started this tradition when I was a junior in high school.  After my team won the city championships, a few of us distance runners started doing a cool-down on the track with some girls from another team.  We ran lap after lap, visiting and winding down after a stressful day of racing.  Pretty soon it was dark and the only people left at the stadium were our parents. I can never remember how it was first brought up, but it came to our attention that it was absolutely imperative that we run naked around every track in the city starting that night at midnight.   We told our parents our plans, loaded ourselves into a couple of cars, and set out for our mission.  We had a few hours to kill, so we ate at Dennys, made an appearance at a high school dance (did some all-new dance moves that would have been pretty humiliating if we cared,)  and made a nuisance of ourselves pretty much until the time came. We drove to the first track, stripped down, and ran naked around the track as fast as we could.  Now, we should have been masters of stealth, but we were too busy laughing and slapping each others' butts.  What ladies we were. :) We did a few more tracks that night and had to call it quits for the year.  We swore to continue the tradition, creating a nake bond between our two teams that would last forever. So, the tradition was born. Even today, my little sisters will run into people who can say, "Hey, I ran naked with your sister."  Now, younger generations are running around tracks naked.  It's a tradition that's kept pretty secret, and we've only had a few cases of innocent bystanders witnessing the event. I'm sure that they don't really mind. Well, I took this naked running hobby to college with me.  I've pretty much made it a point to spread the joy of naked running to all of my loved ones. :)  Well, when we heard about the Bare Buns Fun Run, we wanted to do it. Somehow, through the years, it never quite worked out. We always had running camp to go to and, later, we were camp counselors at the same camp.  It kept getting pushed back. This year,  however, was finally the year.  I rounded up some friends and both of my sisters (much to my mother's horror.)  We took the trip out to Eastern Washington and drove out to the nudist colony bright and early in the morning.  Of course, we instantly see some guys from high school.  It would have been embarassing, but they were naked too....  In fact, everyone was.  We thought there would be more chickens.  When we arrived, we saw our first naked guy out directing traffic in a little vest and nothing else.  As we drove on, we come across a big sign that says "Welcome Home," and as we take a turn, suddenly we see fields, volleyball courts, and a pool filled with naked people.  Ahh. Liberating.  We strip down and engage in odd small talk with other naked people as we register for the race and tie our race tags to our naked bodies with red yarn.  Note: It's really hard to small talk without letting your eyes roam below the neck!!!  After a while, you realize that it's a lost cause, and you just openly look at other people.  I mean- if you go to a nudist colony, you're kinda asking to be stared at, right?   So, we all engage in some shameless staring and pretend that no one is looking at us and our flaws. When the race started, there was a bit of moaning as people got used to things bouncing around that normally don't.  Surprisingly, the pain goes away after half a mile, and the next 2.5 miles can be run in relative comfort.  Of course, when running naked, it is important to pretend you are graceful, lithe, and quick. (really hard on the self-esteem to acknowledge the truth--- NO ONE looks good when they're running naked!) Umm, I could say so much more about this, but suddenly I am really tired of this long-winded story.  If anyone wants to hear more, just ask!

      Ahh. Welcome to the future.  Although I'm only 24, I feel like I'm a dinosaur when it comes to technology.  Many of my students (I teach at a high school) have these Blog deals, and they're always showing them to me.  Comes in handy--- I can check up on them and learn all their dirty secrets. :)  I especially love it when they mention me in their entries, complaining about papers I assign, etc.  :)  Anyways, after much thought and consideration (2 minutes), I decided to create my own blog.  You would think that I've had enough of talking and writing, seeing as of how it's sort of my profession and all.... but it's summer!  I've completely stocked up on ramblings and stories, and here I am- stuck without an audience!  Not that I miss the little boogers... because I don't.  They were pure evil the last week of school and I'm still recuperating.  So all of you out there who are mean to your teachers-- Don't be!  We truly love you.  You just annoy the hell out of us sometimes.
