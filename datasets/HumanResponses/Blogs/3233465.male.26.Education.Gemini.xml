       So I came to Turkey and eventually got offered a job with English Center. I was very impressed with how warm and friendly Ali Bey and Dehan were. Little did Ali Bey know that all he had to do was introduce me to Nazli and I would have worked for 100,000 bin per hour. I believe I met Nazli on my first day after being hired by English Center. And no offense to Ashley Judd nor Beyonce, but I remember thinking that this was as good as it gets, as far as women were concerned. We became friends right from the beginning, although to be honest I was not looking for the friendship route, but I was willing to wait and be patient.  With every passing day, i felt more and more strongly towards Nazli. We began our Instant Messaging correspondence in late October, right before Seker (Sugar) Bayram.  I remember I looked forward to our every night conversations.  It was as great of a courtship as I could have ever possibly imagined.  Well my waiting and patience culminated in our first kiss on December 15, 2003. I have loved her ever since.

       Ok Here's the situation...... Boy grows up in Milwaukee, attends 4 different universities then heads out west post-graduation to probally the most beautiful city in America. Redlands, California had perfect temperature, a beautiful view of the mountains, great location of the 10, and most important two great country bars. But even though I had the chance to sit in a jaccuzzi every night and line dance at the Rockin' Robin, I was still somewhat unfullfilled. I had always loved travelling around the United States and had always wanted to take my journeys to some where outside the continental United States. So around last March, I decided I would travel to Europe. At first I planned on teaching in St. Petersburg, but I eventually settled on Istanbul after a 3 AM television program caught my eye. So last June I embarked on my journey spending ample time back-packing across Europe and finally arriving at Istanbul.

       Let me say that one of the worst creations of man (besides Aryan), is the concept of singing television that has swept the globe. America had it with "American Idol" and now Turkey has it with "Turk Star". Well needless to say, Nazli is a fanatic. There is a no-call rule in place for every Friday and Saturday Evening.  Fortunately for me, her favorite competitor (a Turkish rapper) was eliminated yesterday.  I do suspect however, that this "tragic" turn of events will have no affect on her viewing habits. Sometimes at night while I am lying in bed, I wonder what I did to deserve such cruel punishemnt that bears the name...TURK STAR

       Today Nazli has her interview with another school.  She is pretty excited about the possibility of being gainfully employed by another school. English Center has worn out its welcome and I believe Ali Bey's meetings haven't helped. Good lucj to Nazli!!!!!

       Today I had speaking class with Bahram and Neshee. It is my favorite time of the week, for the two students are absolutely fabulous and I feel we have forged a friendship.  Today Neshee explained that she thought I wasn't like most Americans she knew. It is the third time I have heard such a comment since I have been over-seas. While it is meant as a compliment, I can't help but notice how such a negative attitude of America has permeated the world's consciousness. Some of this is well deserved I suppose, for there is no country or peoples that escape sin and selfishness. However, I still remain perplexed at the biggoted attitude towards Americans. I often wonder, haven't you ever witnessed a bad person or a bad deed done by someone other than American. It makes me confused how in this day and age, people can still group a whole population togther as if they have a common thought process or way of actions. But I was moved when Bahram asked me to go with him to a section of Istanbul where Polish immigrants and their descendants live. Bahram was born in Iran, but has lived in Turkey for the past 20 years. He is such a kind and good man (plus he loves Tom Jones and Sinatra..so he can't be that bad). It is often a wonder how people form two countries who have been at virtual war for the past 25 years, can get along well.  It is this which makes me happy. A man who has every reason to be suspect of me, sees through the cloak of nationality and relates to me as a man.  It is a triumph for both of us on a personal level and something that means a great deal to me. Anyways, I just hope I can always remember this example anytime when I too feel the urge to make judgements on people...whether they be Muslim, Chinese or people from the south side of Milwaukee.

        The Milwaukee Brewers pulled out another come from behind victory yesterday, beating the Expos 4-3. Lyle Overbay has been simply fantastic this season and has already been named player of the week in the National League. Brewers Record is 17-16. Not too bad. We sure don't miss Sexon that much.

       Just got back from work and I will say it is awfully quiet when Nazli ain't there.  I skipped my conversation class today, haven't been feeling too well as of late and I am sure the medicine hasn't helped my alertness. I taught Ayca's class today for two hours. Very nice class although they are getting lazier as they advance further and the weather gets warmer.  Can't say that I blame them, maybe I'm getting lazier as well.  Today the class had extreme difficulty with the difference between "They stopped to play football" and "They stopped playing football". What can you do? Big day today!!!!! First and most importantly Nazli's grandmother is having cataract surgury so my prayers and wishes go out to her and her family. Hopefully the surgury will go as planned and won't be anything serious. Second we are going to Garanti Bank (22% !!!!) and then to a film....should be a fun day....only wish that I felt better.

       In the past 3 days Nazli and I saw two films (Butterfly Effect and Hidalgo). I must say not having a televison has lowered my standards for movies, for I quite enjoyed both. First, I will comment on Hildago, a film starring Viggo Mortenson as a cowboy during the late 19th century.  I like Mortenson but I thought this film was not in his range. He wasn't believable as a cowboy, but I did enjoy the story as I am facinated by the arabian setting and culture. Nazli also wasn't that enthralled with it.  We did have differing views on the Butterfly Effect.  The first half of the film I really enjoyed and I was very scared (I'm kinda a wimp when it comes to scary films....ask Nazli for it was her who had to protect me). But the second half I think tried to accomplish too much and with film's narrow time constraint had to rush the final half hour to reach its conclusion. Ashton Kutcher I thought left alot to be desired. His acting looked stiff and just didn't seem natural. My one complaint is that I thought the story should have stuck with the family problems and how it related with those around them. I thought that they didn't need the psychological time travel to accomplish the films aims. Having said that, anytime I get to spend time in a cinema with two Diet Cokes and a fine Turk by my side, I am happy!!! I think tomorrow we will either see Troy or the whole 10 yards. Should be interesting.

      While some may remember Mr. Selleck for his some-what successful show Magnum PI, to me his true artistry was apparent in his stunning performance in Three Men and a Baby. The ensamble cast featuring Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg, complemented Selleck nicely. But it was Selleck's range, portraying a 30 something bachelor looking for fullfillment in life. I am who I am today beacuse of that film.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      For years I hated country music. Actually hate isn't the truth, I never really gave it a chance. Like most people, I thought "Country isn't cool". Most of us are concerned with seeming cool, so when you ask somebody what kind of music do they like...their answer usually is "I like everything...except country." Well slowly I began appreciating the old Honky-Tonk and Outlaw Country. Anyways, George Jones is still a hero to me and epitomizes the greatness of the Honky-Tonk movement. His songs seek neither understanding nor condonement, but rather only truth. His powerful voice echos the difficulties of life and love. He is legend and it would be nice if people left their prejudices aside, put down the Ludacris record for a minute and enjoy a Honky-Tonk Hero.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Here is a picture of the Turkish equivalent of FDR, Thomas Jefferson, and Ronald Regan combined.  The great Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who was a fierce general and an even better statesman. His refroms included the adoption of the Roman alphabet, secualrism, and the first quasi-democracy in the Middle East. Really a fascinating and inspiring figure, as well as a great uniter (except to some of the Kurds).&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
