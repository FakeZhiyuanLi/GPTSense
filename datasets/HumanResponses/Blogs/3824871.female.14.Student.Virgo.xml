      i have never been more confused in my life. do i love him? do i hate him? should i be mad at him? i mean.. wow. my head really did start hurting. i guess we're ok now, but geez that was tough. i wont tell the whole story b/c its long and confusing. wouldn't want to hurt all y'alls heads no would I? lol j/p. my life is pretty good right now.. i have no major complaints. that'll prolly change by tomorrow, but i'm happy now so oh well. thats all for now... bye'eye

      i have a new found respect for my mom. i mean really. her and my dad broke up, but they still live together like they are married. everytime he flirts with another woman she got all weird. i always thought that was stupid, but now i get it. she loves him and it hurts her everytime he flirts or anything. she should move on.. just like i'm trying to do. i wont give anyone details because quite frankly i'm still getting over it. if i were to tell y'all what happened i would use words that i would regret later. and thats a bad thing.. i think. anyway um i wrote a short stupid little poem when this "bad thing" happened to me. here it is: Why does it hurt so bad i think i loved you maybe you loved me too i don’t why it hurts so bad  when i figure it out i wont let you know you’ve hurt me for the last time i don’t want anything to do with you i just want to get on with my life  i have no more to live for i will find something soon i hope i’m sitting here crying over you nothing will bring you back to me  it betrayle its lies its a waste of time its all in my heart and head  why do i feel like crap why can’t i get over you faster my heart hurts so much i might just die

      this may sound stupid to everyone, but i don't care. they traded my one true basketball love. steve nash is no longer a maverick. i did cry and i feel like i'll never be happy again. i am so depressed. i hate the Suns. darn them. i can't believe he's gone.. i have to stick with my home team, but my babie isn't on the home team anymore. i'll move on i suppose, but its just so hard. thank you lauren for supporting me.. i love you all the more for it.

      hmm what to say. if you know me you know its not going to be intelligent.. cuz i can't even spell that word. i just love making jokes and thats probably what i'll be doing. maybe some poetry, but mabye not. the only reason i actually made one of these is b/c my friend Lauren has one. i wanna be just like her when i grow up *tear*. lol just kidding. i love you all please comment. or don't.. your stupid choice not mine.
