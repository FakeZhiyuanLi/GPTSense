       So...I just got back from shopping with Keeley.&nbsp; It was so much fun because we decided almost everything that we were going to buy for school, but it kind of sucked ass because we only had twenty each.&nbsp; I still managed to get a really cute shirt from Old Navy.. but it's kind of see through... oh well!&nbsp; I'm just going to haev to look a little sleazy! Hahaha! Well, yet again, I have nothing more to write.

       So...this is my first entry in my blog.&nbsp; I've had blogs before, but I seem to never update them...and then I forget what the website is to my blog.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll update this one.&nbsp; So, my name is Tiffany, I live in Virginia Beach, and I'm going to be a sophomore at Princess Anne High School in September.&nbsp; I am a Madrigal in my school's chorus, which is supposed to be an honor, but it really isn't.&nbsp; My best friend is Keeley.&nbsp; She is so awesome and is just like me; we met at the beginning of the school year, when she moved here from San Diego.&nbsp; Which is kind of funny because that is where I was born.&nbsp; We were very lucky this year to go traveling together with our school.&nbsp; We are both drama geeks and got to go to a thespian conference at Longwood University and we also got to go to New York City, which was absolutely amazing.&nbsp; After going to New York I decided that I am going to move there when I get out of high school.&nbsp;    Anyways... I am currently in a production of the play Twelfth Night by Shakespeare.&nbsp; It has been such an amazing experience and I have made some great friends.&nbsp; First there's Matt... he is so sexy, talented, and fun to be around, but unfortunately he is gay.&nbsp; Then there's Sam... he is also sexy, talented, and fun to be with, but he has a girlfriend who he is absolutely in love with.&nbsp; Rebekkah, who is almost exactly like me, is so much fun to be with..."She kills me!"&nbsp; Unfortunately, we only have three more performances and then it's all over.    Well that's all I really have to say right now.... but I'll right more later.
