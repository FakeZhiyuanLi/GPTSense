      Hey Class,   In case you'd like to have a link of some or all of the class linked to your blog (like mine), here's the code you need:   &lt;h6&gt;Class Blogs&lt;/h6&gt;   &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popaganda.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Trena&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  then copy the following URLS (addresses) into the portion of code above which matches & the name where Trena's name is -- before the /ul tag (underline):    http://www.dustin-ebay-mediaclass.blogspot.com  -Dustin http:// pattyannblake.blogspot.com  -Patty http:// sunkistsands.blogspot.com  -Heather http:// centerstage777.blogspot.com  -Brittany http:// aliciahatton.blogspot.com  -Alicia http:// joshanderson.blogspot.com  -Josh http:// katieisperfectineveryway.blogspot.com  -Katie http:// tracysblogmedia.blogspot.com  -Tracy http:// tgoveonemedia.blogspot.com  -Terrence http:// stoogess1.blogspot.com  -Amber   the other option is to  urlLink EMAIL ME  and I'll just copy the code for the whole class into an email for you & you can copy it.  The things that you should recognize about the code above is that you can use it to insert  urlLink HYPERLINKS  into your blogs anytime you want to.  the &lt;li&gt; code is for LINES and the &lt;a href=&gt; is the linking code.  Of course this isn't for the class -- it's just for those who are curious or risky...  peace~

      ............................... setting up your blog ...............................  hey y'all -- welcome to this crazy new world of BLOGGING!  I've included some links over on the right hand side of the page for you to explore if you're interested in the phenomenon of Blogging.  But reading those links isn't a requirement for this class.  Setting up your own blog IS.   So I'm going to devote the remainder of this blog to explaining to you HOW to set up your blog.    1.  You may want to be able to continue to read this page WHILE you're setting up your blog -- that way you can read this list *&* follow the steps simultaneously.  SO, go up to your FILE menu and select NEW WINDOW.  2. in your new window address bar, type in the following URL:   www.blogger.com  3.  Now you should CLICK the "start now" button in the middle top of the page.   4. Filling out the form should be standard for you -- I suggest that your USERNAME be a name that you use to sign in with other accounts (so that you won't forget it) -- the other boxes are self explanatory.  Make sure you click the TERMS OF SERVICE box before you click NEXT.  5. On this next page you may name your page anything you like -- and you may describe your page anyway you like.  I always say that the simpler -- the better.  At the top of my page -- you can see (me)dia -- that's the title I chose.  The next bit -- "Andrew blogs publicly about media."  that's my description.  You can go back and change these anytime, so don't spend too much time thinking about it...click on public blog (so we can read it -- you can make your own private one some other time...)now click NEXT again.  6.  Host it at blogspot. NEXT  7. You have to come up with a URL name.  That's what you'll type into the bar above in order to get back here.  Make it easy.  Something you'll remember.  Ideally something like your title or your username...  8. Pick your "look" and --   BOOM!  you're done.   Brilliant.  Type yourself an experimental message -- or publish to the whole world...PREVIEW your message and then PUBLISH.   NOW be sure to send me your URL right away (with  your first and last names)  the URL was the last thing you chose before your look  -- and the thing that is up in the box above your explorer when you look at your blog.  it starts:   http://www.[something goes here] .blogspot.com  I'm going to make  urlLink a list of our class blogs  that you'll be able to cut and paste together and read each other's blogs with simple clicks of your fingers...  I hope you're excited about this experience.   I've made a few "REAL" media entries.  One on  urlLink radio  (which is really about media diet) and one on  urlLink the real world  (which is partly about storytelling conventions and partly about media diet).  I don't expect your entries to read like mine -- or even like each others -- I expect that each of us have a unique enough perspective that we can say really unique things.  In our own voices.  I do want you to be reflective, focus on media, and integrate knowledge from class. Kind of like the ones y'all will be making as soon as you want to.  You could even do it now! (or after you do some reading / surfing / thinking...)  Remember the point is not to BE entertained, but to ENTERTAIN.  peace~

      ...................................... watching me watching t.v.  ......................................    i watched the premiere last week of the Real World San Diego. I'm tired of the Real World.  It feels pretty formulaic to me anymore.  And mostly the plot lines only change in terms of more SHOCK value.    The movie Merchants of Cool (that we'll watch in class later this semester) talks about a concept called: the feedback loop -- and it seems like me that these characters have become almost too saavy about replaying old episodes from television back to themselves and us:  oh! There's a hot tub!  Well its the first night in our new house!  Everybody knows what you do on the first night in the first episode!  The whole cast gets in the hot tub!  So we better get in.  Good tv is predictable tv.  That's our job this year as "six strangers picked to live in a house"...  the obvious critique to offer is: could this "real" world *be* more about sex?   i have to admit i'm a little bored by that critique (much like i was bored with the sex storylines in the show last night), it seems to me that most of the time when people are freaking out about the amount of sex in the media -- they're kind of freaking out because they're so scared of it. like it (sex) has this amazing amount of importance and sway over them.   which it does. over all of us, right?  we're deeply sexual beings.   But that's not really the point I want to talk about in this blog. the thing which I DID find really interesting was this quote (which i'm only kind of getting right) by the character Frankie (STEREOTYPE: highschool geek, openminded piercer-tattoo-esque, porn-shop working, but i have a boyfriend back home + INTERESTING TWIST: has cystic fibrosis):   "I've always had this dream of moving to a new city and getting to reinvent myself completely."   The world went into slow motion for me. It seemed SO right on.   This is TOTALLY the mythos -- the BIG story -- of most emerging Reality Programming, isn't it?  Personal reinvention.  And its a story that seems particularly important because record numbers of people in MTVs audience ARE going away to college and / or moving away to new cities and places. The shape of the world and growing up is, increasingly, going away.  So why wouldn't we want our HEROES -- or at least our CELEBRITIES (B-level celebrities in the case of reality television) -- to have that same journey -- that same quest...  But then SOMETHING ELSE struck me.   Not only is this the primary PLOTLINE for most reality television.  It's also the primary VIEWING LINE.   Isn't it?   I know that when I watch the REAL WORLD -- I'm invested in the characters.  I think about how I'd act differently if I were in their place.  I'm eager to SEE the places they get to see, to traverse the CITY and the RESTAURANTS and the SIGHTS and the TRAIN and ..  I realized (ironically) that the REAL world is all about getting away FROM our real world. That dream of escaping from our world far enough to turn into something new and different....  more later...

      discursive formations ...................................  I invite any and all of you to help me develop this entry...as you develop your own explanations (on your blogs or wherever...) I'll try to link and   them into this entry.  Just a quick refresher -- that in class we talked about the idea that discursive formations are the ..."conversations that we stand on."   urlLink     Like sedimentary rocks -- discursive formations develop over time in particular places.  Like sedimentary rocks -- we stand on, climb and explore discursive formations as if they were real, but  Like sedimentary rocks -- they aren't finished, complete or unchangeable.    A hundred years, an explosion or a pickaxe could change them a little or a lot.  I gave examples of discursive formations -- law, family, love, school and race.  They're real, but they've been created.  We use them, but by using them, we also reinforce their reality. Here's a website that talks about  urlLink Discursive Formations  (this brief overview connects the idea of a "discursive formation" to knowledge more generally).    Remember that I mentioned that Foucault (in class) was really the guy who most clearly talked about discursive formations.  Well here he is --  urlLink  himself  -- writing about Discursive Formations.  His writing is dense and rewards diligence...  If you want to make some connections between Foucault's thinking and other philosophers --  urlLink here's  a link Dr. John Rothfork makes some of those connections.  But *truly* don't feel like you have to read these sources -- I'm not sure that they make the concept any EASIER than I did in class.  It's just that they add TEXTURE.  If you're feeling intrigued -- these resources will add some interest to your day.  It's a conversation we'll be developing all semester....  Do you have a blog yet?     urlLink Email me  when you do...so i can build a comprehensive list of our class...

      ........................ radios in cars ........................  doesn't my title sound like the name of a song?  or a band?    it seems like such a song would begin:   "We all have radios in cars."  Anyone up for writing the next line?   ....  no, seriously, though.  I personally listen to the radio in my car.  more specifically?  i listen to the news in my car.    at various stages of my life, i've listened to music, morning shows, drive-time shows, talk radio -- all on the radio in my car -- but for quite a while, and more time than not -- its the news for me.    Which creates an interesting reality, you know.  When i'm in the car, that's where I find out about what's happening all over the world (I listen to NPR news -- so there's more international coverage than the media conglomerates offer us).....so even though i'm usually just travelling up and down Cleveland Avenue in Canton Ohio...back and forth from work to home, home to work, I'm thinking about the experiences and realities of people all over the world.   Odd, eh?  Because on some level I wonder if that doesn't transform Cleveland Avenue in a certain way for me.  You know how you can hear a certain song that meant a certain thing for you when you were 16?  And when you hear that song, you think of a person or a place or a moment or a feeling?  It seems like media provides that kind of contextual frame for our lives in lots of ways.    Almost every CD I own has some attachment to the general time period I bought it.  Whenever I play it, I'm suddenly transported to a certain place and a certain time.   So what's the impact of listening to the news in my car?  Well I'm just thinking that it alters the world that is around me in a way that is discontinuous with the people driving in cars next to me.  I'm listening to a story about the dangers of political advertising, but the guy in the truck next to me is listening to Howard Stern and the soccer mom in the minivan that passes me is laughing at Rush. A car packed with teenagers moves their head in unison as a driving beat organizes Cleveland Avenue for their perceptions.   We usually think that reality is an intersubjective place....an experience thats mutually available to me and to the people around me.  But global media makes that less and less true.  I have more in common as I drive up Cleveland Avenue with someone driving on Lakeshore Boulevard in Chicago and someone else driving on Fifth Street in Manhattan, and someone else driving down Main Street in Peoria, IL -- because we're all listening to the same story...in our cars -- our local worlds rolling by, but being narrated by someone far away -- and being interpreted through the grid work of world news...  But on the other hand, aren't the realities of -- the potholes on Cleveland Avenue, the lane closed up ahead, the new store that just moved into that vacant building -- aren't these realities more binding than the mediated ones?    What do you think?  Do you listen to your radio in your car?  How does it determine who you are?  (hmmm....maybe that should be the second line of the song....?  peace~

      ................................................. discursive formations  urlLink (cont.)  .................................................  I'm posting some assumptions about discursive formations that should help our (long - term) conversation.  I'm just posting them up here so you can remember them, think about them, and maybe develop how these assumptions are created to media on your own later....  1. discursive formations are invisible.  2. discursive formations are not natural (they're made).  3. discursive formations seem real (and therefore natural).  4. discursive formations exist because of  relationships   between words and concepts.  (those of you who were there in class today -- hopefully recognize / remember these...)

      ........................................... what makes for a good post? ...........................................  Y'all are pulling out some interesting entries!  Good job...  Here are some emergent formulas that are working well for your peers if you're interested...  I like the idea of  urlLink Rant ing.  It's a favorite pastime in the Blogasphere.  Here's another  urlLink rant  -- this time focusing on the janet jackson / superbowl debacle...such rants are welcome as long as you do connect them to class ideas (which Ben does do here)  The  urlLink careful articulation of a show's formula for success  is a good way to talk about all the dimensions of media literacy at one time...  Talking about a new media  urlLink phenomenon  is great when it allows you to make connections to the media industry in general *&* to our class concepts (which Trena does both of in this blog).  Combining a  urlLink summary  with a rant is another nice way to use your blog-voice...   urlLink talking through your notes  is a great idea to clarify issues and raise questions -- this would be a good blog for others to respond to...and I'll point out, too, MacKenzie, that another question that appeared for me after I read your blog is (while I know the answer, I'm interested in how y'all (not just MacKenzie) might answer...) If Discursive Formations have to be formed in relationships -- once a GROUP decides on a meaning that they will share -- how can individuals have unique perceptions of discursive formations (unique from everyone else)?  Very provocative.  Though they don't *have* to be this thorough,  urlLink applications of concepts  from the readings -- to real life -- are great blogs!

      A peripheral issue that we'll be dealing with tomorrow is advertising -- and the role that celebrities play in advertising.  I had these links sitting around and they're pretty interested for those of you who are interested in advertising --   urlLink this site  gives a cultural history of "anti-ads" (very much like the SPRITE strategy that was featured in  Merchants of Cool .   urlLink Douglas Rushkoff  (whose  urlLink blog  I really enjoy reading) traces a history of advertising in his book.  He was the host of  Merchants of Cool   More on the danger posed to *truth* in the  urlLink anti-ad  from Salon.com, and then this  urlLink very disturbing piece  compares advertising to psychological torture -- but then again, anything adbusters does intrigues me...  In some ways celebrity advertising -- particularly traditional celebrity advertising is much more naive than the anti-ad, but Madison Avenue is finding ways to integrate celebrity appeals into the anti-ad...

      check out this  urlLink helpful annotated bibliography  on the topic of celebrity (our focus in class on wednesday).    anybody trying to figure out a topic to write about for a final project or a critical essay may want to browse through this list for ideas...   urlLink this link  is really not directly related to mass media -- but the things that it reveals about celebrities and their commodification -- is profoundly revealing about the role and nature of mass media industries within our society more generally....  Probably one of the things that fascinates me most about celebrities is that there IS a real person involved -- one blogger  urlLink refers to the awkwardness of the relationship  between person & commodity when it comes to celebrity identity -- of course the *empathic* understanding of the "poor" celebrities is what's featured in movies like  Notting Hill  or  The Bodyguard  -- but I like this idea that  urlLink Punk'd  has really gotten at something more interesting about this relationship...

      I was bouncing around the internet -- and I found  urlLink this article on the Osbournes  from back when they were a *hot*, new thing...  It's a really NICE explanation of how GENRE - formula can explain a great deal of what does and does not work in a show.

      ....................... it is what it is .......................  i happened upon this article about  urlLink "off the grid" journalism  -- and there's a great deal of insight about not only political campaign journalism in this article, but also much larger stuff.  Ways in which the media operates in general.   it feels to me like its a way of offering resistance to our (seemingly) natural complicity with mythic narrative.  If you're intrigued at all -- go read it...

      .  fall update .   The leaves are  dropping out of the sky like slow sporadic colorful rain.  The light  that sits outside of the broad bay window in the dining room still has the  dramatic brown and gold quality of all the maple leaves around the back  yard, but the sun barely powers the light to penetrate at all.  The  world looks silent and slightly bored with the inevitable death of autumn  hanging in the air like the leaves barely attached to their  branches.    Jaelyn's just  finished her frozen toaster waffles and she's scrambling free of her  brightly colored plastic booster chair.  She spends a few moments  transferring water from the refrigerator door to the sink where one dirty pan soaks.  The little blue plastic tea cup only transports a thimblefull of water back and forth.  This game is technically an illegal one, but the true danger of the game still sleeps just now. Addison has been waking up in the middle of the night for no apparent reason and staying awake, quite pleasantly, for close to an hour.  As a result -- mornings for him don't come until at least 8:30.    Later this morning, Jaelyn, Addison and I will take our trip to the McKinley Museum where they will both revel in their simultaneous terror and thrill and the mechanical dinosaur that greets them with a roar and a clunky swipe of his ridiculously mechanized paw.   ROAR! says Addie to the dinosaur.  One of his most clearly pronounced words.    He's just pretend.  Jaelyn assures me or her brother -- or maybe herself -- as she tightens her gri[p on my hand.  After an hour or two at the museum we'll return for lunch and negotiate how many noodles or how many carrots or how much of a sandwich must be eaten before we can break out the halloween pumpkin full of tooth-rotting possibilities.  Lynn will return from Malone & I'll be up and off.    This is by far the best semester we've had teaching-wise.  We're teaching classes that we've taught at least two times each and we're starting to get the hang of scheduling heavy grading seasons.   This semester, Lynn and I both decided not to teach the introduction to College Education and Issues-type course that we've both taught in the past.  She decided not to because we almost adopted a third baby.  A long story, best shared in person.  I'm directing the Forensics and Debate program at Malone (a one year, interim position) so that fills a little extra time, and a few more weekends.   Our lives are defined mostly by our work and our kids these days -- but here are some of the events and accomplishments that made the Fall Semester particularly meaningful:   A trip to New Orleans for a delayed celebration of our ten year anniversary.  I presented at the National Communication Association and we got a chance to spend time with our dear friends Cliff, Mary & Deidra while there, too.  Jaelyn started school. Preschool, at least.  She goes three days a week, three hours a day to the Lab School on Malone College's campus.  That means that I get to take her to school two days a week, and Lynn and I can observe her through the one way mirror / window between classes.    Settling into a church that we love (!) Akron Christian Reformed Church was introduced to our lives by Marcia Everett.  We're lucky to go to church with many other friends who we deeply enjoy from Malone -- the Waalkes family, the Jensen family, the Leon family, Dawn Buckley, Jim Brownlee...and we're enjoying getting to know others.   Family Thanksgiving at the Rudds is always a favorite holiday, and while an injury in our Patriarch prevented the annual NOTAL BOWL from being played...we invented a hybrid competition which included dodgeball, capture the flag, and a dark vast empty building.  10 Year Homecoming at Cedarville -- meant the invigorating conversation and time spent with our dear friends the Cearleys and Janson Cearley in Cincy.  After the formal dinner where Jaelyn and Addison tried to turn off the banquet room lights on 300 people (twice), the Rhinds, the Davises, and the Mathiesons  were kind enough to wait with me while the locksmith arrived to accomodate the (ironic twist of fate) LOST keys to our car!  An odd *14 year* high school reunion for me plopped into the middle of my Fall, too.  It was only "odd" because it was *14* instead of 15.  But it was great to see people who have impacted me and who I have loved deeply.  It was, of course, too short and quick to make meaningful connection with people who I've missed. Speaking of...if there's any chance that Shannon is reading this...email me!  I lost that little bit of paper that I wrote your email address on -- and I can't find you on the internet.  A surprise opportunity to catch up with my dear friend Allen McElroy occured when I visited Marietta on his birthday...we stood on the top of a beautiful hill where his home will be built and shared our joys, struggles and journeys.  Friends like Marcia Everett and Toby & Elaine shared life in the small ways -- but the best ways...by sitting around and having fun and occassionaly deep conversations with us.  My ten minute play, Video Collection, was directed by one of my favorite students, Josh Aufrance and debuted during Malone College's Ten Minute Play Fest.  I don't know what the critics said, but I loved it.  Lynn made increasingly intricate jewelry for Christmas gifts and fun.  My friend from grad school, Bei Cai moved to town and threw a fun party.   A great visit from Uncle Ryan and Aunt Angie was cause for celebration and enjoyment.  Addison's Birthday celebration was a big one.  Friends from church and school came to celebrate with him.  Christmas at the Rudds and the Leindeckers were big highlights for the kids who continue to "get it" each year.   The Rudds exchanged individually made "ART" for each other.  Daniel Rudd wrote a BOOK! (literally) for Andy/Lynn/family.  Marianne illustrated it and they together had it bound.  If you visit, be sure to ask to see it.  It's amazing.     Erik, AKA basement boy, (our roomate of two years) asked Laura Miller to marry him.  She said "yes!"

      . Spring Update  .     We're still too close to the semester  to make sense of it.  It's seemed busy and relentless.   Hopefully in retrospect we'll see more clearly how the press of life and  work and family opened up our vision.  For now, it still feels like  we're in the blur...  January 6 -  The new semester  begins.  Lynn teaches Reading in the Content Area for the sixth time  and Principles of Secondary Instruction for the third time.  Andrew  teaches Research Methods in Communication for only the second time, two  sections of Mass Media and Society, and directs the Forensics and Debate  Team.  It's profound how the courses that we teach shape the way that  we think about time passing, our personal identities, our work, our play  and our ambitions.  Neither of us went into the semester very excited  about our teaching loads, the rhythm of academic life doesn't always  assist in the quest for learning.  January 17 - 19  During a forensics meet at DuPage College, the family meets up with and spends time together with the Livermores in Geneva, IL. Spending time together with close friends who share ideals, longings, and many common histories is one of the surest ways to re-enliven our home / life / partnership / enthusiasm.  January 29 - Andrew's student and friend, Amy Watkins dies suddenly and unexpectedly.  Amy was a funny, dark, talented writer / director who had just completed a successful semester in Los Angeles.  She was set to direct a (witty, wry, incisive) film in the Student Film Festival and her unexpected death impacted many of the students who I most immediately share life quite profoundly.  March 5 - Mom & Dad Rudd visit for my birthday and we enjoy a long (for them!) visit together.   March 10 -  Mom & Dad Leindecker come up for a dinner at Pizza Hut -- these visits are more regular and therefore MUCH enjoyed!  March 15 -  I abandon the family for national Christian College Forensics Tournament.  I get to spend a fun day with Gary and Annie, and then enjoy the fact that the entire tournament is punctuated by the presence of Cliff and (very pregnant!) Mary.  March 30 -  After a long battle with dementia and Altzheimer's, Lynn's Grandma Erman dies.    April 12  - The Student Film Festival finally arrives.  Attendance is huge, response is great.  Andrew says, "I love this group of filmmakers. Just working with them makes my job enjoyable."  May 3 - Lynn and Andrew enjoy seeing so many graduates who have meant so much to us in the Parking Lot after Commencement.  Later in the afternoon, they find out that Lynn's other grandmother has suddenly and unexpectedly died.  May 6 - Lynn and Andrew both begin teaching a one-month abbreviated Summer Session course.  We have small classes and (thus) good dialogue.  We're both really enjoying this teaching opportunity.  May 16  - The whole family enjoys a walk to ROS -- Lynn's favorite ice cream place -- a .5 mile walk from the house. We have a blast with Dawn; Marcia, Amy & David; & the Leons.  Memorial Day Weekend  - We travel to catch up with our dear friends the Gibbs and have inspiring conversations and chaotic-kid-filled exploits.  We travel to Ryan and Gigi's and visit the gardens (pictured above), listen to great tunes, visit the (cold damp) beach, and enjoy laughing and talking.

      . vacation summary - retraction - reflection -  .    import from  urlLink the back burner     we spent the last week in michigan. drove from canton at 6 p.m. last thursday, returned to casacommunitas at 12:30 this morning.   during the trip up, lynn and i had some deep - dark and some deep - light talks...i felt much closer to her. seems like talking / conversation -- the value we share most deeply and that binds us most fiercely to each other -- is always priced at a premium these days ...   spent several days with dave and linda in south haven, mi. we hadn't been there before, but it seemed just about perfect. the extended gibbs family has been singing its praises in several keys for several years and so finally their witness broke through and i accepted this particular unique salvation.   what was the shape of this grace?   free bikes from our inn, so meandering conversational bike rides, plenty of great food, "committee meetings" galore, some hardcore sunburning on the shore of lake michigan, lots of rich dialogue about everything imaginable.   late one night, after my E self had pretty much vampired all the energy of the other three I's in the room....i proclaimed -- "that's all there is in the world! memories and relationships!"   it still seems like a worthwhile axiom, but later we discovered that i had left out essential things like eating and tables in that particular equation...   hung out for a long time with each of my brothers and parents by the pool at geborgenheit. with david was provoked by the shocking revelation that he doesn't think about the future. no five year plan. no ten year plan. no thoughts of legacy or coherence. just honesty and genuineness *now*.   with daniel we debated pacifism and then the redemptive arc hermeneutic...   which brings me to the retraction -- turns out that LYNN is NOT a pacifist. she's just clearly opposed to the war we've most recently engaged in and thinking really hard about the implications of a commitment to nonviolence.   resultant self discovery: turns out that i am more likely to EMBRACE *then* consider when it comes to new positions. this may be a helpful rubric for those of you struggling to justify my earlier self descriptions as *liberal* and *pacifist*. i chalk this up to my 1.) penchant for hyperbole, 2.) my empathic strain, 3.) my procilivity to think outloud (i think marcia gave me the term "external processor"), & 4.) my tendency to want to think / be / perform outside of "the box". which, if you think about it, is kind of odd because this whole *embracing* thing just locks me into a new box...   sometime i'll devote a whole blog to how affixing our identities to the various discursive formations that surround us is always problematic and conflictual....but (big sigh of relief audience) not today.   have i fulfilled the promises of my title? can i end for the day?   ~peace.

      - saturday. finally. -     import from  urlLink the back burner     it's an archtypal saturday morning.   we woke up late. (i haven't woken up late since I decided to be a more serious writer -- as most of you know 5 am is my date with my muse.) I had echinacea tea, j & a joined Lynn for some chai tea. She picked up an obsession from Andrea G. & the kids have joined her in her devotion to the stuff...   J & I both have the coughing, sneezing, sniffling, sneezing croup so HONEY in my tea (since I read _secret life of bees_ this summer, I have the sneaking suspicion that honey *is* the cure for everything) was great. Been listening to coldplay parachutes loud.   The kids are playing in the new sandbox grandpa garry just built them yesterday (read: that's not a sandbox -- that's a SMALL BEACH.)   The whole family ate popcorn and watched the neverending story last night. We've been fielding questions from Jaelyn about "what *is* the -nothing- though?" all morning.   I'm imagining a psuedo sci fi story where the nothing (eg. anti matter, black hole) slowly approaches the earth, and there are religious wars in churches, which are, along with casinos and brothels and prisons -- packed out....but the whole story wouldn't be about the world coming down (and i'm thinking that the world-coming-down story would be gentle and inevitable like the short story _The Ceiling_ and the novel _Blindness_ - not like the movie _Armageddon_) it would be about a religious conflict over whether or not different END TIMES theological frameworks (the kingdom coming, the rapture, the millenia, the apocalypse) could be REALLY HAPPENING in the approach of the coming nothing or if the coming nothing signalled something else. Kind of like a theological debate in the style of the _Name of the Rose_ -- only not quite so death-and-destruction as that story....   Eh?   And we put an offer on a house closer to Malone and it was accepted and now our house is on the market and we have to paint our kitchen ceiling, fix our bathroom (downstairs) walls, put in a little flooring, make up for three years of bad gardening plus the onslaught of fall...and we're signing hundreds of papers. And the tenure process is taking forever along with a self study that i'm heading up in the department -- we're sorting data and developing coding processes...   (anyone *else* bored with that last paragraph? how'd you like to live such administrivia?! BUT YOU DO!?! that's the kicker -- if it isn't homework, its taxes or investments or gardening and 401Ks and church boards and the United Way...)   And so when Jaelyn says but what *is* the nothing? I want to tell her that its the colonization of institutions upon the freedom and happiness of our minds....   But I know that these very same institutions frame our lives and give us privilege (give *me* privilege) that we otherwise couldn't enjoy...   It's a beautiful saturday morning -- sunshine in the wake of the leftover hurricane storms we've been feeling. And the resting makes me *see* the frenzy and the routine in a way that's not so benevolent.   I hope your Saturday morning gives you rest and peace and HOPE for the rest of the week -- because ultimately, I affirm that its not the presence of the institutions and their suckage that =s The Nothing --- it's the seeping & creeping away of HOPE in the bustle of trying to keep up with the great Sucking....and i hope that rest & hope leaves you feeling God's   peace~

      . Addison's Birthday .   urlLink     this morning jaelyn, lynn & i surrounded addison's bed and woke him up singing happy birthday.    we got through the whole song twice -- inches from his face -- and he was still laying there, hands folded neatly behind his head theoretically sound asleep.    at the end of chorus two, lynn said, "who's going to open one of his presents first thing this morning?"  no twitching or changing in the sleeping face, but his hand quickly thumped his own chest.  Birthday song?  ho-hum. Birthday presents? Well that's a whole different proposition.  the picture above is from LAST year's celebration -- the waalkes kids, jae, & leah surround the birthday hero.  below is a more recent photo (in action this summer).  though most birthday celebrations will be postponed til next week (because of jaelyn's severe strep -- and probable infectiousness of all of us), we're still celebrating Add's entry into our world!  He's a crazy, funny, smart guy, and we're the lucky ones...   urlLink     peace~

      . wobbly teeth * celebrity dreams  .    import from  urlLink the back burner     Tonight we were riding home from the grocery store when suddenly a LONG profound silence from Jaelyn pooled in the back seat. I turned around and turned on the overhead light.   Have I told you before that my daughter who has the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes in the universe also has an uncanny ability to spill buckets of tears from those eyes at will?   I’m not talking about crying. I’m talking about a unique ability to sit silently, wide eyed and cry tears so violently that her face is soaking within a minute?   The moisture is building in her eyes.   ME: What is it Jaelyn?   Niagra Falls.   JAELYN: I almost broke my tooth.   ME: You what?   Have I told you before that my daughter has the most astonishing oral fixation yet documented (in my somewhat limited experience with such things) in a four-year-old? That she not only chews her fingernails and hangnails and dolls feet and hands and teddy bear paws, but also the sleeves of all of her shirts. And what’s more – tonight, she decided to chew – to pull violently – to … I don’t know what she was doing…snapping her elastic black pants with her teeth?   And sure enough, one of her front lower teeth is loose.   It was such an interesting moment, because the flood of her tears came to feel like Eden lost...they were genuinely pentitent, but neither she nor I could do nothing to reverse the angels at the gates with the flaming swords.   Everythingteeth.com (or something like that) assured us that four year olds are the right age to lose their teeth (even if mother nature gets a bit of help).   I cuddled her on the couch as she sobbed after I explained that the tooth would probably fall out, and though she would have a hole in her smile, a new tooth would eventually grow. Its amazing and horrible to feel the weight of a four year old dealing with the profound understanding that a choice she has made is undoable.   Is it true that in general, as a child, you get used to the idea that the world is not so much fixed as it is routine? That all that happens may well be purged and cleansed by the next time around? New Years doesn’t matter because years aren’t picking up speed and there's no great loss if you miss an opportunity this time, because it doesn't affect all the future opportunities you'll ever have....?   Freudian psychologists say that if you dream that your teeth are falling out – you’re fearing your own mortality. I don’t dream my teeth falling out, but I have been dreaming ALL THE TIME of being on trips – to far away places – amalgams of places I’ve lived and places I’d like to go. In every case, I run into old friends, and together we spend time with more recent friends. And I know that something is about to happen in these dreams.   Oddly enough (this is very strange for me), I’ve had celebrity dreams twice in the last week. Last night I was hanging with a bunch of friends (Burt, Brenda, Brendon, Natalie & Lynn) in a library that overlooked the Santa Monica Beach. And what’ya know….guess who was there? Jennifer Anniston! She engaged me in some banter about the note I had sent Brad. She’s been so funny about pretending that I’m really the snooty one to get to know – and people accuse HER of it! Imagine!   Two nights before that an old family friend that Lynn and I share – who just happened to be a dignitary in Iran before the Shah fell, asked Lynn and I to take Sheryl Crow to lunch at the local casino. He wanted to get our opinion of her before he asked her to sing at a fundraising lunch he was having. She was also very funny, really joking around and everything with us.   I’m not the guy who’s a star-f*$#er. I really have very few parasocial relationships with media figures, and I’m only interested in the phenomenon of celebrity in a very distant objective way.   So what do these dreams mean?   Will Jaelyn’s tooth fall out?   Stay tuned in 2004   for answers to these questions…   …and more.   peace~

      .......................  The Psino  .......................    import from  urlLink the back burner   I was never sure why I was a psino (silent p); if it was something i had done; something i should be embarrassed about or something that was generally true of everyone.   it was certainly true of everyone that was in my sunday school classes.   Jesus loves me, the psino, for the bible tells me so.   Perhaps "psino" was a theological term describing the comprehensiveness of original sin?   It was a ridiculously long time before I figured out my error.   this, I know.   and i thought of it this weekend when Jaelyn asked me and Lynn very insistently and repetitively:   "What is Cruisey - Violence?"   It took a lot of conversation to realize that this was her take on the crowds maelovelent chant in the JESUS film (which she's been watching) as they chant, "crucify him!"   She'd been walking around muttering the magical dangerous phrase "Cruisey Violence" all day.   peace~

      . addison fandom  .   import from  urlLink the back burner     my parents gave us this remake of the "Jesus" movie -- the one that missionaries cart all over the world to show in villages where we don't have time to learn about their cultures or languages or problems, but that probably need to say the sinners prayer sooner rather than later given the impending end times and all...   (but wait, i digress, apologies to my dispensationalist friends and family for my sarcasm...)   the jesus movie is *way* better than the other two videos that my parents have given me for my kids -- the cedarmont kids & Ms. Pattycake (for these two gifts alone, i'm guessing that my parents will languish in Limbo for several years before they find the pearly gates -- who knew that there was anything worse than those dreadfully stepfordian Barney's children -- trust me the cedarmont kids are two levels of hell worse)...BUT....   Addison is obsesed with it. Anytime there is a question about what we will do next -- where we will go next -- how we should pass our collective time? His answer? Let's watch the Jesus Movie.   We were sitting in a restaurant last night and he noticed that they were playing a radio in the background...his idea -- we should go home and bring the Jesus Movie and listen to that instead.   Hey Addison -- want to go outside and play? Yeah, then we come in side, and eat and watch the Jesus movie.   Me: No, buddy, we've watched enough media this week...   Addison: Then we go to sleep and wake up and THEN we watch the Jesus Movie.   Me: Add. You've watched that movie enough. Why don't we act it out together.   Addison: we play Jesus movie, the dead part, (his other obsession -- along with Mel), THEN we watch the Jesus movie.   Me: Addison, we're not going to watch the Jesus movie right now.   His entire countenance falls into a mixture between enraged and despondent.   ADDISON: HOW we going to watch it?   Me: You mean, WHEN are we going to watch it?   ADDISON: HOW we going to watch it? We never EVER get to watch Jesus movie.   so you take that obsession and braid it with the cultural critics' obsession over the Passion -- and you have a very crucifixion centered lent....

      . family update  .     import from  urlLink the backburner   this is the "here's what's happening" regular update -- target audience: people who care alot; lonely parasocial lurkers, beware. tedious cataloguing of the mundane follows:   i'm enjoying my semester much more at malone this semester. i'm teaching my two favorite classes (only), & having time to *almost* get all the work done that i'm supposed to...   i've got a couple of stories i'm scripting right now -- they're at the stage of newness that i can be purely excited about them still...   lynn is teaching a normal load & also partnering with the local urban school district in a number of ways. the work she's doing is very rewarding and difficult -- trying to equip overworked, under-resourced teachers to develop literacy strategies for under-under-resourced student-populations.   one of the school districts has made some *huge* cuts in the past few weeks -- maybe more if a second levy is defeated this month. that whole bleak reality has been saddening and disheartening...there were a few days that lynn de-celebrated as the: "death of idealism"...   we LOVE: our babysitting coop. Our friends Jeff & Linda & Brian & Jenni have an arrangement which results in a date night two out of every three weekends and a housefull of two-through-four year olds every third weekend. It feels like a really solid way to share life and invest in each other's vocations and families. It's also really fun to have so many dates with the woman I love.   jaelyn's sick. not that that accounts for most of who she is and is-becoming, but it certainly occupies a front-ish burner right now. It's a recurring theme throughout the winter particularly....   Last night was a humdinger though. Between Lynn and I together I'm sure we got eight hours of sleep. Well. Almost. Vomit, not breathing through stuffy nose, fever, achy neck, sore throat...   BUT IN GENERAL ~ Jaelyn's delightful. She loves to play imaginatively with little people, dolls & animals; she can do so for hours with her brother uninterrupted and unsupervised. Okay for one half of an hour. But given the (st/)age we're emerging from -- a half an hour feels like a lifetime... She loves to care for sick, sad, or little people. It seems to be a part of her that's pretty unique and just - her. I admire that quality in her....   she really likes preschool & visits to the local YMCA --   as does ADDISON ~ who apparently deferred the terrible twos (because he was sweet, gentle, generous, kind, funny) until this week. He's ornery this week. In eastern-ohio-culture -- the personality trait of "orneriness" in children is celebrated -- particularly in male children (but occasionally a girl, too). It's a part of the cultural milieu that i'm still puzzling about.   He loves cooking. Seriously. Real or play cooking. Trains. Balls. Stories about (as he calls them) ROARS. (the most recent incarnation of said "roars" is a plea to include at least a guest appearance of Simba in any story you tell him...yes, i'm galled at the triumph of the disneyfication of the universe even in the lore of family and history...   we've been trying to sell our house for five months.   we want to move into a more diverse school district, a more urban environment & closer to work (eliminate a car) -- but we can't seem to sell our house.   we've been showing it more than once a week for the past three weeks, which is great right? Wrong. After 5 months, you're just resigned to the fact that whoever is looking at it is *not* going to put an offer on it. So you punctuate your day with a mad dash home in the hour you have between classes and meetings and you once over the bathroom and swiffer the kitchen and stuff all the brightly colored plastic toys into the large, someone less cluttered looking, but also brightly colored rubbermaid containers. it gets tiring.   But its one of our definitive rhythms right now. a recurring motif.   i'm using the term "post-evangelical" to refer to my faith journey right now...and feel disheartened by most of mainline American Christendom -- particularly all of the ways it gets commodified, represented & politicized -- BUT curiously, in light of all that -- I really love the church we're going to now...   as always, i miss my friends, miss time with my friends, and enjoy most the few opportunities there seem to be in life for true communion...

      . a perfect moment .  the banks of the creek behind the cemetery which borders the back of our circle overflowed by fifty and a hundred feet today.  Lynn saw it on her run, and we all went down to see.    inevitably we started to wade, and as the children recognized how transgressive the moment was -- we started to frolic.   I'm always reminded that I'm in a perfect moment when I see Jaelyn Running.   She has a funny and completely authentic gesture of whirling one arm -- at full length when she's running in complete abandon.  She doesn't even recognize it when she's doing it -- and can't really make it "pretend" to happen.    So today as she ran through the Knee Deep water -- splashing everywhere -- Lynn running and yelling too, Woo Hoo -- and the arm started going --   I had a flash of recognition that we had found one of THOSE moments.  A moment where all the rules go hazy and all the background floats away -- where you are completely and utterly HERE -- RIGHT NOW -- with EACH OTHER.  I flopped under the water myself (brrr!) and then attempted to cross the creek.  The raging creek was at my armpits and despite all my (substantial) girth fighting against the creek --> I got SWEPT AWAY.   I grapped tufts of grass and pulled myself to the submerged shore.    Addison and Jaelyn ran freely and wildly.  Splashing purposely to sit down up to their necks, climbing atop an island tree or water main cap.  We waved to the maintenance workers who smiled at us from their mowers and bulldozers.  We tried to be subdued when mourners drove by, but it was hard.    The world was overflowing and we happened to be right in the flow of it.

      . in michigan this past week .  we had quests with the cousins -- trekking across the dangerous Backyardis to recover some potion from the wooden castle to heal Queen Glorianis' fatal eyebrow twitching disease.  The costumes pictured here were Queen Glorianis' disguises (pulled straight from the Easter Cantata Closet) to sneak the children past the wizards --     Cousins, acting like foxes narrowly escaped their pursuers Bampa & Uncle Andy, colored with Aunt Gigi, posed for Gramma Glo, collected hundreds of tadpoles from the water above the pool cover.     The "notals" sat around the table for hours like the endless talkers we are.     And Bampa and I discovered / created a performance art / game that the kids (ok, and the adults) played over and over.  Who knew that a poolcover could be so great?

       Archive Imported from my Original Blog -- The Invisible Next Step    Hearing Vocation In The Accidents of Their Work    I am a full time, tenure tracked professor at a liberal arts college.   This is not where I expected to be. This is not what I wanted to do. This is not how I imagined things.   So I find it strange to see that I am tolerably good at it.   I find it heartening that perhaps all of the accidents and compromises and negotiations that got me here *may* yield something of promise.   As a boy, I was Max Fisher. I was designed for the stage. And when the stage wasn't easily or readily available to me -- I flung myself onto other stages and started directing the goings on as if I were some sort of master-director (I wasn't; I'm not). That same boy would pour over the movie ads in the newspaper, memorizing every detail, since, of course, we did not attend the movie theater -- 1.) there was nothing good there in the first place, 2.) if there was, why was it *there*?, 3.) if we were to go, someone from church might see us and *think* that we were going to one of the bad movies. So Hollywood became forbidden fruit. Because? I wasn't allowed to taste it? Because I was foreordained to love storytelling? Because of its cultural capital?   As an adolescent, I was encouraged to pursue the staqe. That way, said my parents, and youth leaders and teachers at my Christian School, I could bring the dramatic arts to the church. Because I would not want to work in Hollywood or on the television (which was growing in its grip upon our family -- now that we could watch syndicated shows from the Good Old Days) or in New York. Big Apple? Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil? The forbidden fruit? A tree with a long oblong chip in the trunk?   And then as a senior in college, I affirmed another lifelong dream. I wanted to be a writer. A novelist. And I scribbled a couple of short stories into literary journals, won a small contest, was rejected from two MFA programs and, as consolation, tried to invent a career that could afford to keep me scribbling.   And five years later I walked down an outdoor aisle, was hooded, congratulated, and suddenly -- accidentally -- just before I turned thirty -- made to work at a full time job with benefits and pay scales and raises -- instead of quilting together work and gifts and opportunity and talent into a piecemeal something that would allow me to keep scribbling.   Last year, I grew suspicious of the whole process. Still scribbling, still scrapping, I ventured in a new direction. What if I just admitted that I was disappointed with this life. What if I just admitted that I wanted a different life, *and* with all the extra resources I had left, *chased* that new life?   And so for all of last year, I have fermented in my discontent, dialoguing with Lynn, hammering out a promising screenplay, and doing my dayjob with enough fervor to keep everyone at the college confident that I was not sneaking into the "bad" cinema...   I spent a few days in Santa Barbara and Hollywood this Spring, saw both of my writing partners, spent a day with a television writer from PAX (the *irony*! on so many levels), and suddenly found myself realizing that I didn't want that life. Not now. Not given what I'd have to leave. I'm still hammering out the scripts (with more and less enthusiasm), but realizing that perhaps this path that I am on is a good one for me.   Not that this feels like a path. In _Sacred Journey_, Buechner tells the story of his life and recounts the whispers of God to him in the most unlikely places. Whispers that he never recognized until much later as having beckoned him toward God. I tell my college freshman when we talk about _The Will of God as a Way of Life_ that I've never experienced the will of God as a path -- or even the clear blazes on trees spaced evenly apart. What always happens to me is that anytime that my to-do list abates enough for me to take stock of where I am, make a decision, decide to follow God, or try to make sense of my life -- that I look around me and I find that I'm at the deepest place imaginable in the woods. Nothing is recognizable. There are no clearings in the distance. But I hear a whisper -- "over here." But by the time I turn around, there's no voice. Maybe even there never was a voice. But *now* there's something about *this* direction which makes a bit of sense so I move...   But to you, reader, this woodsy metaphor seems to offer irational hope. A "feeling of peace" emerging from...what? A confidence which doesn't make sense out of any particular past. It doesn't offer promise about what's come before....   But you weren't lucky enough to have grown up at Treasure Island with me, either.   Every summer, our family pilgrimaged North to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where we wound down a two lane highway to a dirt and gravel road, hewn out of the woods by my grandfather. You didn't feel the surge of endorphins that we all did as we peered through the windshield and through the dense pine forest and strained at the curves in the road, the whole station wagon engulfed by a rollicking chorus of "Around the Corner's the Cabin!" (to the tune of "for he's a jolly good fellow". There -- that's all you needed to sing it -- because there are no other lyrics -- "and now we're almost there" -- sometimes).   But I was lucky enough to spend those two or three weeks every summer in the woods with my father, in a boat fishing together with my brothers, building treehouses, making fires, learning archery, reading novels in hammocks, racing through "treasure hunts" with elaborate clues and absurd feats of strength and will, playing boardgames as the sunset over the bay.   On many days my father would take us into the woods, hatchet in hand, seeking the trails he had blazed in his boyhood. To "blaze" a trail means to leave an oblong chip on a large tree -- these trees spaced a minimum of ten feet from each other. He taught us how to hold the hatchet, how to "read" the moss on the Northern side of the tree, how to line up trees in multiple directions to avoid circling endlessly in the woods. From those days, I remember everything. I remember the light through the trees, I remember the crisp Northern air, I remember the nervous excited sensation that we may be getting lost or we may be finding something extraordinary, i remember the sense of tradition that enveloped us. My father, at my age had walked in these same places, his father before him. We looked together for the next blaze. Some of the trees had fallen. Some fallen prey to the spruce worms in the late 70's. But when we found the blazes, they were so ancient -- yet so clear. They had been there for a thousand years of possibility and looked as old, but they were as clear as if I had stepped through the wardrobe just three days ago myself and en route to Cair Paravel, blazed them myself.   The byproduct of these days? I cannot feel lost in these woods. (In any woods?) I feel a quiet calm confidence in my training. If we need it I can help us to find a way to an edge of the treeline. But for now, lets just look at what's around, I tell my wife when I take her hiking, pathless through these woods. Because I always watch everything with the trained eye hoping for an ancient blaze on a tree -- every uniquely fallen tree, every surprising fungus, every jutting lichen strewn rock marks my sense of place. And these symbols reassure me.   So proceeding at intuition, it turns out, recognizing: "oh yes, *that*!" is less a blind faith in feeling, and more of a recognition of the tradition and history that has made me.   There! There! That mark on that tree! Over there! Is that just a place where an old branch used to be, or could it be a happy accidental call from my father? From my father's father? Despite the trees that have rained down through these eons, the scrubby undergrowth that has risen to meet them, the hopelesly similiar look of so much of this landscpae -- that voices of meaning can emerge? That if I find those voices, I may make something genuine of my own?   that perhhaps -- all of the accidents and compromises and negotiations that got me here *may* yield something of promise? [ Tue Apr 15, 04:27:21 AM | Andrew Rudd | edit ] I find it very difficult to hear God.   I grew up in smaller mega-churches, just on the cusp of the nondenominational mega-church movement. The demoninations I grew up in were splinters of splinter groups -- fundamentalist, dispensational, pietistic, non-glossolial, KJV only, bus-ministry-sunday-morning, AWANA clubs sponsoring, REVEREND [insert the name of the senior minister here on the church sign] churches. These were churches that would "disfellowship" a "sister church" because they believed in the mid-tribulational rapture of the church instead of the pre-tribulational rapture of the church. These were churches where missionaries mourned the "cult-like presence of the charismatics" in the developing world countries they worked.   Do I need to clarify that I do not remain in these churches?   Did I *hear God* when I was in them? Probably I did, but to me it was always the voice that was speaking over and against the surrounding babble. The voice of God was the marginal, oppositional, secret sub-text, undermining the proto-text.   But since then...!   I have tried to be faithful, believing as I still do that God has called me to the divine pursuit, but I have found it very difficult to find a tradition / a community / a place to hear God.   Lynn and I have heard God in what's felt like waves and then we've wandered in what's felt like silent deserts for eons.   The last three years in Canton has felt, in general, more like a dessert. We visited 17 churches, tried to stay in three, had a wonderful homechurch experience that didn't work out.   When I mentioned to Lynn that people would be standing up in church on Palm Sunday to praise God, I thought I saw her eyes fill with disappointment. I read in her gaze -- what does that have to do with us? God is not talking to us these days. And while I wanted to have a different feeling. Those words reflected by deepest suspicions.   But this past Sunday our church invited the congregation to stand up and talk about God's presence in their lives. Harry (the minister) threatened that if no one stood up, Ebeneezer might just start in (Ebeneezer is a 3'x2' boulder awkwardly placed in the sanctuary alongside the --; a boulder that Harry hauled into the sanctuary ten years ago when he arrived as a marker of where God had brought the church then).   People stood up and told stories for the next hour and I cried quietly for the whole time.   The stories were about children with precarious physical conditions and horribly specific dietary needs, about losing a baby after two weeks, about losing a seventeen year old sister in the middle of a long unemployment spell, about feeling Grace while marking the fourth year of being widowed. People losing jobs, bumbling through vocations with surprising profit, finding shocking grace in small "lowly" work, being healed from a fear of marriage.   These people were (I felt astonished) hearing God in their loss, hearing Vocation in the accidents of their work (!), finding truth in the unbearable sacrifices of the quotidian.   When I first read Sacred Journey, I felt the same quiet tears of relief. That *YES* God could speak to us through the unexpected. Through what was around us. Through our accidents and mistakes.   Everyone was calling out Hosannah on Palm Sunday. Jaelyn, my daughter kept using her palm branch to tickle the 23 year old woman in the row before us, who I do not know. The woman was crying, but laughed every time the branch brushed her. Jaelyn's eyes were delighted by everything. When the drums were pounded she raised the branch high and swayed it back and forth. This caused our eleven year old friends David and Michael to laugh.   For the first time in a long time I feel like I am MOVING. That I have a step to make. That my leg is already extended, and I cannot, on any count see where it will land, but I don't care. I want to go. I want to move.

      In the email today I got Harry's sermon -- I guess since we missed church (one more way that "community" evidences itself ambivalently -- people *expect* you to be places -- when you aren't your position and identity become more (or less) precarious within the community).  It's funny because when I *read* the bulletins / sermons / follow up that ACRAC (our church) sends, I've always read them invitationally -- we miss you, come again when you can.  But I know that other churches I've been a part of would have sent such missives steeped in implicit messages of judgement -- "where WERE you?  HMMM?"  And that's the funny thing that I'm thinking about this concept about COMMUNITY -- that the more we BECOME community -- the more RESPONSIBLE we are to each other -- the more RESPONSIBLE we are to each other -- the more OBLIGATED we are to one another -- the more OBLIGATED we feel -- the less AUTHENTIC and PASSIONATE we feel about our actions (always our actions before our relationships lose their passion...).  Lynn's growing-up-life-in-a-genuine-old-school-community (farm life americana) has made me deeply aware of the perils of COMMUNITY. of SMALLNESS.   Harry asked in his sermon -- this poignant leading question:   Today’s gospel reading raises another theological conundrum concerning prayer and forgiveness when we read:  “If you forgive anyone his or her sins, they’re forgiven; if you don’t forgive them, they’re not forgiven.”  What about that statement?  How does that fit into our theological framework?    And then after developing a contextual reading -- answered it this way:   We Christians, have actually become God’s instruments of grace to this world.  We Christians, are the way that the world experiences the forgiveness of God.  That’s a pretty weighty thought I think.  YEAH.  me too.  He talked about forgiveness within the context of a family -- how our tendency to think about how those around us perceive us collectively -- undermines our ability to *forgive* each other (but fill in the blank on "forgive" -- "invite", "enjoy", "celebrate", "engage", "listen."  I'll get into the institutionalization of relationships in another blog, though.  Gotta take a bowl of soup down to my sick daughter who is watching ELMO...

      It's ten thirty and I'm avoiding all the things I should do, because suddenly there are so many things that need to be done.  The internet seems to play to this tendency in me.  I suspect its because it simmers with incipient connection (incipient is a favorite word of mine).  In moments where I'm feeling overwhelmed, I find myself craving some kind of quick satisfaction.  The two that are most appealing to me (for better or worse) is a *real* connection with some person / idea / story OR food.  I'm trying not to go with the frig tonight, so I'll blog into the great wide open.   Everythings going *CRUNCH* right now because I'm heading to Kalida tomorrow.  Erin -- my friend and former student -- 's dad died.  I don't know the details yet.  I'm just feeling the ugly thud in my stomach of death.  I've been talking about death to the kids today.  Its inevitability.  Its importance.  Its finality.  The brokenness left in its trail.  So I'm buzzing across the state for calling hours -- which is the LEAST I can and should do -- but as I'm trying to put all the pieces together I'm struck by this idea -- that COMMUNITY costs something.   This is not a surprise, but it seems profound to me right now.  I ran into this great blog --  urlLink Ordinary Community  --yesterday and I was longing for the things they were articulating (even though I'd say I *have* some degree of them -- as much as "community" is a thing that you can have), but then later I was thinking Yeahbut -- community as  urlLink GOD TERM  is sooo not enough (inasmuch as it is a rhetorical move).  Because Community Costs.  So that's my backburner of the day today.

       Archive Imported from my Orignal Blog -- The Invisible Next Step    Longing Together    I suppose I've already taken the (invisible and inevitable) next step....I invited several of you to actually read this blog. I've actually been journaling and reveling in the anonymity for awhile on this blog and others, but reading Jared's blog last week convinced me that the whole I idea of *linked* texts created a much more substantial, important way of being in the cyberworld.   Or, more likely, a convergence of multiple co-incidences convinced me anew of the value of “community” even online…   Last Wednesday -- Josh, Toph, Emily, Sam, Katie, Jeremy, Trena, Andrew G., Ryan K., Seth, Kelly (back from LA!), Sarah, Brian Hollingsworth, a group of people who I love a great deal all came over to watch and discuss Waking Life with me. It's my second time through the film -- but fun to watch it with a bunch of filmmaking people...The sentiments of community seemed pooled all across the shag carpet of the basement family room to me...   And that groupness is co-incident with, of course, the whole line of narrative within that film regarding the collective consciousness of everyone -- a vocabulary which I couldn’t help but indigenize -- to talk about the longings we all share and the common brokenness that attenuates living and becoming in contemporary times…   Coincident with --reading one of Sam's emails -- each one of which always encompasses at least one narrative universe -- and I told her that she should start blogging and sent her to read the Prayer of Jael postwhich I got a tremendous kick out of...   I’ve been lurking for a while on several blogs and only when Sam asked me "what this whole blogging thing was about?" (and Marcia asked the same day...) that I really started to muse about the communal and co-performative nature of this new communal writing....   I wrote to Sam:   …in a sense all the interconnects of people who read each others journals seem to actually create a kind of shared consciousness…people separated by space and time   i also sometimes think of their interconnected narrativity as a kind of performance. public performance. almost like a way too wordy play where there's nothing but exposition and the conflict isn't betwen two of the characters and no one's really trying to be explicit about what the conflict is..   Coincident with our weekend trip to the Gibbs Family Abode in the Detroit Suburbs. As we meandered closer and closer to their house, Lynn and I realized that neither the directions I ascertained from Greg, nor the ones Andrea gave her included a house number. Each ended with us arriving at “a brown ranch house.”   I have always loved about the Gibbs the way they throw themselves with joy into the life that they are living. They *live* in a brown ranch house like no one I know could. The colors Andrea has painted the walls! The photographs that Greg-I’m-“into”-photography has taken of the kids! The firepit on the back patio! The joi de vivre of their brood! The improbability that they will ever use words in French or Latin backhandedly even though they could!   The weekend simmered in happiness…swapping stories, disappointments, ambitions…   And then (at least for me) boiled over on Saturday night when, as Greg cooked a phenomenal tenderloin, the stories and the meanings really kicked in.   They shared about the community that has adopted them – how powerful and strong the force has been in their life. We talked about the language of redemption that this community has given them (Follow Christ! Even when the Church Fails!) – and I shared how the language of redemption for me right now is probably the opposite experience (What?! I can find Christ here?! In the Church!)   Andrea said – so well – “And what’s so cool is that God is calling both of you. Calling you through this one language of redemption and calling Greg and us through this other language.”   And we all talked about how that language meant so much because it was so rich in the *presence* of People. How much the love and mentorship and grace and gifts of these men for them – of Marcia (and Harry and the Waalkes’ and Dawn and the Leons) for us deepened and made resonant the possibility of life in community.   But for them and for me it has been the presence of so much SHIT in the world that has made this community so important. Andrea talked about the feeling of WEIGHTS around her legs for even the most mundane tasks. Lynn mourned the difficulty of finding respect and love in her disparate roles and apart from her staunchly silent and pragmatic family. Greg talked about the difficulty of separating ego and identity from church and church work. I mentioned feeling lonely, unsure about vocation, fractured in my fathering and partnering.   It is the brokenness that is our own and the brokenness that we inherit that makes the possibility of CALLING within COMMUNITY so invaluable….   Coincident with: visiting Ryan and Angela. When I walk through their house I feel like I am drifting through the best possible version of what I like. Ang plays a cello in the living room, white shear curtains billow from the paned windows in the guest room while I page through the collective memories of friends and family who have also slept here, Ryan's pictures and nostalgic technology pop in the most surprising enjoyable places, Angela's albums are as carefully crafted as my grandmother Linda's, Ryan and Ang and I conspire together over guitar, CDs and Cello how we will -- very soon -- become rock stars (!).   And then coincident with all of that -- I happened to scroll through my address book today and hear a hundred rushing whispered reminders of the voices that have poured themselves into my own voice. I was impressed with the great fortune of the people I know and have known.   So now I’m officially blogging about VOCATIO.   And my assumptions (If you’ve slogged through the bramble of all these posts) thus far are:   It’s hard for me to hear God’s voice.   God’s voice shows up from things that we hated, regretted and didn’t expect to matter initially.   God’s calling comes to us through community.   What’s next?

      My whole motivation in starting to BLOG at all was rooted in this idea that I’ve been developing for the last year.  My good friend  urlLink Clifford  suggested that we start blogging about our common interest in rites of passage – only our blog – Bytes of Passage hasn’t really started blossoming yet.  Cliff has just transitioned to telecommuting and freelancing to make room in his life for the imminent arrival of his new son.  I’m (as always) trying to dabble in too many lives simultaneously ( urlLink teaching , family-man, filmmaker, hack songwriter).  And Cliff and I are together trying to write a brilliant mainstream, Hollywood-bound, commercially viable version of a screenplay we crafted together a couple of years back (in that incarnation – an “indy, tonal, character-driven piece, refusing (some of) the conventions of narrative structure – it’s funny what a poseur you turn into in retrospect…a really good argument against blogging).  So all that to explain what this back burner topic is that’s practically at a roiling boil on that burner because its been back there so long (or maybe the length of time just means that all the liquid is going to evaporate…?).  Having  urlLink grown up in a faith tradition  openly hostile to tradition and ritual – I’ve found the depth and resonance of ritual an immensely refreshing resource in my own journey of faith.  I’ve also (of course) recognized the pervasiveness of ritual within any and all cultural milieu – even the fundamentalism of my youth.    My current embrace of ritual – and my ongoing interest in Rites of Passage – was even more focused and directed through some conversations with my good friend  urlLink Lauren .  In the Learning Community that I taught in for the last three years with her – she has been very focused on developing a “Lifespan Development Perspective” in her students.  Her talk has really influenced me.    I wrote my M.A. project on “Coming of Age Voices” in “genX” (whatever that is/was) films.  Only I was very locked into this idea of Coming of Age that was rooted in the adolescent phase of life.  Lauren really opened my eyes to see how age-ist that assumption was / is.  Coming of Age is something that happens to us all the time.  Throughout our entire lives we’re becoming. We’re reframing. We’re transitioning. We’re making sense out of the past in terms that will fit the immediate future.   But the kicker is that in the post-industrial / post-Fordist / postmodern world – I’m becoming convinced that we lack the institutions and networks to adequately transition people throughout their lives.  Globalization for the last hundred (or more) years has continued to erode the natural / given connection between geography and family, between neighborhood and church, between education and locale.  (Obviously I’m lumping vast numbers of political, economic and technological changes into the sort of nebulous category of “globalization.”)  What Edward Hall called “Low Context” cultures seem to both 1.) have lost their rootedness in tradition, institutions, and formal ritual *&* 2.) be more and more influential in spreading the syncretistic (and colonizing) gospel of faith-in-progressivism.  I’m not railing against the causes – and I’m also not *simply* critical of the processes I outline (eg. I participate in them too).  I am convinced though that the current state of the world invites opportunity by the church.    Shouldn’t / Couldn’t / Why-wouldn’t the church be the ideal institution to measure out the grace and hope that rites of passage & rituals afford to their participants?  Perhaps what I mean (since the evolution of such rituals is – at some level inevitable) is – couldn’t the church be more intentional about developing such rituals.   I’ve got ever so much more.  Program Planner /  urlLink Max Fisher  that I am, I’ve developed an entire curriculum / package / ideal…but that will have to wait till another back burner.    I mentioned my newfound “friend”,  urlLink Jonny Baker  and have just two nights ago finished reading his  urlLink MA Thesis   -- and really loved the framework of what he’s talking about as well as the application of ritual theory to alt.worship.  I found the whole experience of reading deeply redemptive and inspiring.  Inspired me – in fact to devote this “Back Burner” blog to this long stewing passion.    I’m off to the family cottage in Northern Michigan) in two days, so I may not get any more of this hashed out til I return (end of June-ish…), but I wanted to at least get it started.   Being trained and (for better or worse) rooted in academic tradition – I’d like to close with a shout out to all the great minds that made so many of the ideas above so much more clear to me….Kenneth Burke, Van Gennep & Victor Turner for their writings on ritual, symbol & performance, Marcia & Lauren for their work with the Learning Cluster, Cote & Allahar for their helpful thoughts on coming of age during “Generation X,” Richard Linklater – who continues to raise and respond to these same kinds of “becoming” questions with his great films, David Harvey, F. Lyotard, F. Jamieson & so may others on all the “post”s.  Hall & Geertz & my Ph.D. advisor, Al Gonzales for their ideas and conversations about culture.  Geez, I feel like I’m giving an oscar thank you speech only the telecast SO already went to commercial.  Sorry about that – just wanted to be sure that everyone understood that those ideas were not necessarily mine – I just happen to be a particular discursive formation hy-bred out of them…  ~peace.

      I stayed home from church with Jaelyn this morning, because we've diagnosed her as having strep throat.  I had it last week.  She has all the regular symptoms, and we were lucky enough to take her to the medi-center where the doctor heard our diagnosis, nodded his head and wrote the prescription.  We decided we loved him.  There's something perverse about the medical system that always forces you through this bueracratic routine with the physician approving or testing etc... before you can make substantial decisions about your own or your children's health care.    One more argument for how the scientific method has weakened our ability to live well -- or free -- or something.    My new best friend (who doesn't actually know it yet, but does he have to in a world of free floating disembodied identities?) Jonny Baker keeps a  urlLink list of worship tricks .  Maybe I'll follow his lead and keep a list of how the scientific method has debilitated us.  I need a catchier title than that, though.   A Litany Protesting Science?   The Anti-Science Thesis?  Where exactly is the Wittenberg door that I can nail this sucker to?

      well it seems like blogging has, for me (temporarily?) gone the way of the ... well, whatever the extinct thing was that went at the end of that colloquialism.  Hmmm.  It seems like as technologies emerge, I love to jump on the bandwagon around the end of the  urlLink early adopters phase  -- and then it either does or doesn't integrate well with my life.  I'd like to dream that each time they integrate well that they improve the process -- facilitate the flow, but I'm too fond of  urlLink McLuhan  to be quite that naive.  But like McLuhan, i'm also optimistic.  Someday when this technological optimism link is blue -- that'll mean that I've devoted a back burner or two to these thoughts about how technology colonizes our imagination and how it might free it...  So here's the dream.  That all the people I love decide to blog, too.  That we all.  together. (simultaneously - of course - while I'm on a wishlist) decide. to *be community* via the web.    Maybe the most ongoing disappointment of my life (and don't worry I'm not disappearing into a funk -- I got a good sleep and plenty of caffiene today) is the fact that my dearest friends and the people that most inspire me / love me / enrich me.  Are mostly far away from me.  Globalization! [andrew spits].   [andrew regrets using such a visceral gesture since it translated so thin-ly onscreen and made such a mess on his already disgusting office carpet.]  When my friend Kelly went out to LA to study â€“ I set up a blog for her to tell us about her experiences in LA without feeling like she was writing rambling descriptions and depositing them in our inbox unsolicited.    i thought it worked out beautifully.    i read her exploits religiously -- but whenever i wanted.  sometimes i responded; mostly I didn't.    the blog seemed as redemptive a technology for the negative massification effects of web technology as was the voicemail / answering machine to redeem the telephone (connection over intrusion in both cases)  Martin Buber writes â€“ â€œall real living is meetingâ€�  - if the blog lets us MEET, then isnâ€™t it a life-giving force?    Since this is sorta a "metablog" anyway -- I do have to admit that one of the rich discoveries of this year's vacation was that the notion of BACK BURNER is an important one to keep me whole.  I journaled a whole entry (in my private journal, Lynn, just to reassure that even people "like that" (like me) who want to "write in journals and then publish them on the web!") on what exactly a back - burner is, what ends it might serve, and how it may (or may not) move forward onto front-er burners...  But that'll have to be on another back burner!  My heart is with Mary right now who, as far as I know, is IN LABOR having a *baby*!  Tell me that's not crazy.  To have the disembodied knowledge that one of your dearest friends is BEARING A LIFE right now...  I started filling in random links over there on the right.  But these have no referents nor categorization, but should at least enlighten and entertain...!  Peace~

      Cliff and Mary successfully bore Jackson Grey into the world.   I talked to the on the telephone last night.   Cliff is responding like I did to the enormous precariousness of just keeping this small bit of flesh alive.  Which seems crazy, but seemed so monumental to me.  Lynn and Mary both were somehow able to recognize the resilience of babies more clearly then I was / and now Cliff is.   But all day on Wednesday last when Mary was in labor -- my largest back burner was obsessing about the astonishing interminglingness of death and life in humanness.    My father in law was very sick.  And I felt this large sense of dread.  My intuition was at +10 that loss was going to counterbalance the arrival of Jackson and the celebration.    Nothing so far -- but I've felt very raw each time I hear about loss in other places -- on the news -- in Palestine -- a friend of a friend...  The world feels so temporary, and I feel so attached to it in these moments...

      - eriks wedding - dissing ohio - d.dra kicks the diss - about schmidt - compassion in filmmaking -    We're packing up to head down the road one hour to Berlin Ohio where Erik -- two year housemate will wed Laura.  Jaelyn has a silky white dress she'll wear as a flower girl, and I'm slated to give the homily at the wedding.    An interesting sidenote -- we're going to Berlin which is NOT pronounced berLIN as the rest of the world pronounces the famous german city -- as if by decided by some grand old ohio committee sometime in the last two centuries (since this year is ohio's bicentenial), the state has decided to use the rule of them they employ when referring to Lima (lie-ma) and Louiseville (LouiSSS - ville) and refer to it as BERlin.  Just around the corner from Sugarcrik (though, its spelled creek).   Remember a few days ago when I spat at Globalization -- here's another indicator of my bifurcated identity.  I just can't bring myself to take responsibility for the deficiencies of Ohio -- despite the fact that I'm about to enter into the dreaded eighth consecutive year of residency here....  Deidra's been at our house for two days -- she's on a celebration tour after successfully defending her diss. on female action heros -- the short version?  female action heros provide positive models for understanding emerging feminine roles in culture *&* female action heros subvert emerging roles for women using coded patriarchal strategy...did i get it right d.dra.  Watched _About Schmidt_ for the first time.  Loved it, of course.  I think my favorite dimension of it was the Kathy Bates character.  Scorcese talked about Wes Anderson films having this quality that the filmmaker actually loves his characters.   A refreshing way to view the kind of flawed characters that Anderson writes -- and, according to Scorcese, not at all the norm in contemporary filmmaking.  I have a theory that this compassion for characters is usually demonstrated THROUGH the compassion that particular characters have for the main character (who is usually the most flawed of the bunch).  So i think that Roberta Hertzel's character is that character in this movie.  And I love how her libido is sort of a very explicit articulation of this quality.  It's like she just pulses -- I have love to give.    I haven't heard much talk about how LOCAL a film it is.  I really admired Alexander Payne's fiercely midwestern (and not in the OHIO midwestern) vision of the world.  I think somebody somewhere should have a blog called Dear Ndugu.  I'm sure they already do.  In ten years that'd be a great name for a rock band.   More later...

      - rededication to blogging - going meta - travel anecdotes - are people MADE for something -   Just returned from long weekend in Michigan with family and am now committed to going public with this blog (thanks, Marcaus, for the prompting...).  Please pardon the "dust", all, because its going to be a work in progress shaping the right links and figuring out what i should and shouldn't say here.  Blogs seem to me to be sort of an odd (con)fusion of private and public kinds of disclosure.   I realize that I have a painful tendency to go "meta" when i'm writing in this venue.  I tend to constantly wrap layers and layers of commentary around everything I'm saying.  I'm sure this is a cultural symptom of something, but I'm not sure what.   So the weekend away was great.  Lynn and I have a great tradition of unravelling the experiences of the trip as we ride home together.  J & A are at the age where they are able to entertain themselves and each other for long enough gaps that we're just starting to have those conversations again.  I must digress for a moment here.  We were pulling out of one of the new 80-90 rest-areas-that-look-like-churches-or-malls-or museums last night and the light was on and Lynn was standing on and over her seat helping the kids settle into the "beds" that we made for them and we passed a cop.  He backed out of the median and started following us.  We weren't speeding at all, so we're pretty sure that he started following us for Lynn's illegal stand-and-turn.  If only he could have seen HOW illegal we were with the kids makeshift beds all sprawled everywhere.  Someone needs to make a laying down seatbelt for kids and long trips.  Is there such a thing?   So it turns out that not only do i go meta a lot -- I also digress a lot.  But if you know me in person, you already knew that...  My favorite times were a family history video session with my grandparents and my dad, a long chat by the pool with my dad & throwing the toddlers around int the pool with my brothers.    The *delight* that they had: splashing, jumping, getting thrown, climbing up the backs and shoulders of uncles: it all seemed so core: as pure as I imagine Plato's idea of the forms to be:  something sacred and divine.   I really had a good time smashing together the 30 minute honorific dramatic presentation of my Grandfather's life story.  My aunt Nan had written down all the great stories and structured them in four acts.  It was up to us to make them theatrical.  My sisters in law (and Ryan) have low tolerance levels for Rudd - Theatrical - Performative- Production - Projects.  And the show was bumpy -- but a crowdpleaser none the less.  from script to stage in 5 hours.   It reaffirmed all of me that IS  urlLink Max Fisher .  Have you NOT seen that movie yet? (DAVID!) Max explains so much of me.   My back burner question for the day is this:  are we made for something?  And I don't mean are we ALL made for something -- because I know what our chief end is -- and I affirm it.  What I mean is -- are we made to DO something?  Are we -- as individuals?  I'm lamenting / considering / reflecting on my profession and it seems so wrapped up in this question of -- but am I doing the BEST thing?  Is this the RIGHTEST that I can get it?    This year the water at our cottage was Incredibly Low this year.  So low, in fact that, for the first time in my life, I found the Fresh (very cold) water springs that feed the lake near the shore (well -- they were kinda ON the shore at low tide this year).  The experience seemed seminal (did you hear that Kristy? Jared? ) and deep (not literal).  These springs were so -- i know its corny, but -- inspiring!  They were just these ridiculous little bubbles of water -- that looked like a broken drinking fountain -- no bigger (until you stepped into them).  But you look up and there's a LAKE in front of you. A BIG lake.  A lake that is connected to Lake Huron -- which is also just fed by these little miniscule -- ridiculously poignant bubbles.   And so I journalled:   I was thinking that every person must have SPRINGS inside of them.  That some things must feed  us just because that’s where they are in our souls.  Aren’t there some currents some bubbles in us that are OURS only and not  simply products of the world out of which we were borne?  Some desires that we have, some gifs that we offer that don’t come only from the people who shaped us and the places where we’ve been?  Shapes that are somehow essentially ours?   But I'm not sure of it -- and i have lots more to say, but I have to off-to-marcs to stock up on Diet Coke (5 cases for 10 dollars).  And I KNOW that I shouldn't like Coke.  Jakki did a speech all last year about aspartame (which is just in diet) and J. Baker had  urlLink THIS  on his site today.  SOMETIME -- i need to dedicate SEVERAL back burners to this subject -- how do we consume faithfully in a world that's already overglobalized and overly branded....!?!?  please do  urlLink send responses  if you have them!  peace~  p.s. am hungry & headed home to supp -- and the  urlLink email  leading to this article plopped into my box -- my friend Cliff has nothing but good things to say -- All The Time.  I read whatever he writes -- and you may want to, too.  p.p.s. deke & kelly had a baby, too!  all these babies pouring forth from the universe!  the world is bursting with invention and possibility.  how will we ever get the world ready for them in time?  how will we ever get ourselves ready for them in time?  we probably won't be quite ready, Anna, but we're glad to have you all the same!  we hope the rudds get the opportunity to lavish half as much love and laughter on you as your parents have generously given addison & jaelyn!

        - correction - speculative rant on political rhetoric -     a couple of days ago i posted a link to the  urlLink Political Compass  .  My brother David said me a sagacious and corrective email:   >2 things > > 1. your political compass test is not well written, many of the questions > demonstrated a bias toward the "right wing". > 2. i ended up one click right and exactly on the horizontal axis. > > I guess that means I am more balanced than you, and therefore from now on I > should be considered the political moderate of the family. > > Thus all ideas differing from mine will be considered extreme  I deferred to him and wrote back:   > you're right.  I didn't realize the negative affect of them framing the test > that way -- though I certainly recognized it as I moved through (Five > straight disagrees in a row) -- but after I took it i clicked on the link to > find literature that reflected my position.  apparently NO ONE has written > from a liberal left perspective -- Of course the right wing literature was > blossoming on this site. > > But what ends up happening -- if the test is skewed right -- is that > leftists (eg. me) look like extremists -- and righties (eg. you) look > centrist. > > BUT i'm happy to give you the political moderate slot in the family.    and now i've been thinking about the whole experience and wondering if its endemic about something larger that's happened / happening in the american political rhetoric sphere.    I think that one thing that conservatives have beat liberals at hands down in the last fifteen years (with the psuedo-exception of Bill Clinton and sorta Bill Maher -- though he's only SORTA a liberal) is POPULARIZING their discourse.  From Rush Limbaugh on the radio to FOX news on TV to Focus on the Family in the religious sphere.  These folks know how to articulate their message to everyday people.  This is a huge shift in american popular discourse.  Liberals, after all, used to be voice of the masses.  And actually the TERM liberal, I think has become a polarizing one.    My take (and obviously pundits have already talked about this) is that the new "godterm" in our society is "moderate" or "centrist" but there's a subtle skewing of the MEANING of this term given the massive takeover of the government and the media ownership (not the reporters or editors -- because i agree -- they're liberals) by the right (of both political parties....).  "Liberal" becomes a devil term to centrists, "conservative", on the other hand, I think, is only a devil term to the liberals.   I think that David would argue (am i right, D.R.?) that my last sentence is evidence that there's been an actual shift of the center, but my argument is that there's been a CONNOTATIVE shift to the right, that reflects how people respond to TERMS -- but that that isn't reflective of how people WOULD actually vote for social policy -- BUT the evil intercourse between the political parties (both of them) and the media industry has reduced our political DISCOURSE to a bunch of SIGNS divorced from the actual meanings that people are living...  Am I trying to taunt some of you into starting up your own blogs? Sure.  Anything to share our lives together! :-)   PEACE (i mean it, even in diversity of opinion) ~ andrew

       - family anecdote –    Sometime last week Jaelyn showed me a dollar bill.  “Daddy?  Did you know that this is George Washington?”  I did and I told her so.  I asked if she knew that G. W. was our first president?   She nodded enthusiastically.   ME: and who’s our president, now, Jae?   She shrugs.   ME: His name is George, too.   That small prompt is all she needs.   JAE: George Bush!  ME: Right!   Her face suddenly  becomes completely solemn.    JAE: He’s killing everyone!  (For those of you who haven’t been around recently – Lynn and I have become pacifists; for those of you who have, we haven’t always been.)  Well, I nodded solemnly, war kills people and he did choose war. And then (as it always does in a four year old world) conversation changed direction.   Well yesterday, Lynn drove the kids past a house festooned in balloons and flags and streamers and signs.   What’s happening there mommy? Jaelyn wanted to know. Someone is coming back from the war, she answered, the war that George Bush made him go and fight.   (I know, I know, political dogma, but we all do it…)  JAE: I’m going to kill him!  (for the record, we’re pacifists, not radicals, so this response seemed a bit unmerited.)  LYNN: Oh, no, Jae, we don’t kill other people.  That’s only more violence and that doesn’t solve problems.   ADDISON: (from the carseat) Go home!  LYNN: What?   ADDISON: GO HOME!  LYNN: You want to go home?   ADDISON: (and now I’m going to move to a more literal transcription) o-ome-et-tick!-pokey!  LYNN: What honey?   Eventually she decoded:  I want to go home to get a stick and I’ll POKE him.   We took the family to see a children’s theater rendition of The Emporer’s New Clothes at the local civic theater a couple of weeks ago, and Hahn, the evil prime minister character was POKING the villagers with his cane – the image has stuck with our kids. POKING is now the most heinous punishment they can imagine.  A much more serious fate than even being decapitated (I threaten them with chopped off heads at least twice a day – no! they shriek and laugh and run out of the room.  I’m thinking of writing a book – Growing Good Children Through Capital Punishment).  It’s finally a quiet day – the last of our dear friends made their way through last week – Ted, Harry, Joe & Roxanne & Bei and family…now we need a day of quiet.  Well psuedo quiet.  Toby & Mark are upstairs drywalling the bathroom, Gary’s coming later today to help tear off the roof on the porch…but at least its sunny!  Lynn surprised me with Panera Coffee this morning.  I have an amazing wife…  Happy Birthday Dave L.! (Sorry I forgot to say so on the phone!)  Hope y’all have a Sabbath day!  Peace~

       - hearing the call -   so i've been thinking about vocation -- and jotting ideas into a file to maybe make it into a blog someday -- but probably not because it got too long -- and I already impose enough with my rambling ideas -- and as a result of me thinking about vocation --   i asked Harry to clarify what he meant when, in church last sunday he offhandedly corrected himself,   "when i decided to become a pastor.  well...what am i saying...i didn't decide to become a minister..."   and then off he went in another direction.   so he said -- no, he was called by God.  AND it turns out -- had an experience where he *heard* God.    Now I know that some of you readers have had such experiences -- but I have not.  I like the Frederich Buechner sense of hearing God THROUGH your own story -- the countours of your life -- in retrospect revealing a shape of God's revelation to you....  But that's as good as it gets for me, folks.  I'm interested in how others have experienced this notion of God's "CALL" --   Harry described it as a pure clear thought.  Like no other mental clarity that he's experienced.  I'd definitely take that.   I've had the argument with my dad & david -- that moderns (and I am one -- like it or not) cannot hear the voice of God because the selective attention that we've trained our brains for is only attending to the bits of reality that conform to the scientific vision....  Sort of a cultural-lenses argument.  but i'm willing to surrender these lenses -- if i could find a way to do so that would make me think that possibly i could hear something genuine and authentic (eg. i'm leery of being trained to speak in tongues or be slain in the spirit...as I'm afraid that such experiences may just be physiological experiences...on the other hand C.S. Lewis' retelling of the Cupid / Psyche myth -- in Til We Have Faces ...and or...the way the stable door functions in The Last Battle ... may suggest that i need to let go of my stranglehold on rationality to surf the experience before I can even get to the magic?)    I WANT magic.  I WANT the divine -- and I want it in a more immediate package than I've encountered thus far.    You know the first scene in Slacker where Richard Linklater's character talks about how all the decisions in our lives end up being other roads in other realities that we never get to know about.  I thought of writing a quest story about a guy who is me who just gives up on rationality in hopes of finding God.  I guess he'd leave his job and town and everything.  Wouldn't he?   peace~ andrew

      - Writers Bloc -   Hey writers or creative types out there.  I've been wrestling with a creative problem for too long.  I'm going to ask for input here & then let it gestate for a few days -- i'll work on a different project in the meantime.   I'm revising the most recent screenplay _The Legacy of Troy Ludwick_ is our working title....I need a GESTURE or an ACTION that signifies that someone is a nurtuing person.   My character is a man -- about my age.  So the question is -- can you help me?  Do you know a nurturing person?  If you were walking downtown with them (or in any public place) -- what gesture might cue onlookers that they're a nurturer?  Or what action might you infer that someone were a nurturer from?    Stories of nurturers, all.  That's what I'm looking for.    peace~

      - welcome dear old friends - generic family / life update -   for those of you visiting because of my most recent invitation -- let me just say -- hey!  glad you're here.   things for the rudds seem to be on a predictable arc, generally:   1. we love  urlLink our kids  who are getting bigger and cuter and smarter all the time.   2. we both continue to teach at Malone -- and, for the most part, find that work fulfilling.  3. i "go up" for tenure this year -- so am devoting much of my summertime to preparation for that rite of passage.  4. we've been travelling to Michigan and South to Coshocton regularly this summer.  5. to our status-chagrin, but travelling pleasure, we're now driving a mini-van (please feel free to ridicule...)  6. we've settled into a church (Akron Christian Reformed) which we really like.  7. we continue to feel ambivalence about how suburban our life is -- and wonder whether this is the lifestyle we intend to sustain and nourish.  8. we continue to read voraciously -- both fiercely recommending  urlLink Peace Like A River  -- as our first book to clearly meet our old favorite recommend --  urlLink Atticus   9. we still love time spent with friends and family -- but mourn the fact that so many of the people that fall into those categories live far or work too hard (or we do) to spend the time and depth that we'd like to be able to.  (i kept trying to NOT end that sentence with a preposition -- and it just kept getting longer and longer.  i just gave up eventually.)  10. we're having our leaky bathroom re-done before the kitchen ceiling falls in on us.   in the perhaps-less-predictable category:   1. the film _independent study_ still languishes in post-production-purgatory.  i still have hope that a cut of it could be forthcoming within the calendar year....  2. lynn derives some of her greatest personal fulfillment from her ongoing work with the urban Timken Academy -- she finds it to be a rich environment of professional and educational risk and reward.  hmm.  on balance, we seem to be more predictable than not.    but we feel provoked by life.  and that's good.  if you read our last  urlLink family update  -- we sound as if we're about to fall into the depths of the doldrums.  i think the summer has been healing...  in any case -- we'd always love to hear from you!  peace~

       - issue: indymedia, short form art, microcinema -    Have you seen any short films?  Very many short films?  I've been increasingly interested in short forms.    I wrote a ten minute play last year that was produced here at Malone -- and I've written several more this summer.  (early drafts yet.) i'm pretty excited about  urlLink flash fiction ... i think the music video more aptly gets at the experience of contemporary existence than most other extant forms (eg. maybe the music video is the new great american novel).  i'm watching the short films on  urlLink triggerstreet  and a couple of other places, and i wrote a treatment for a short film about a mucisian who is obsessed with writing the perfect short (one minute) song.  The perfect one minute song (in my film) would be composed & performed in one minute.    The great difficulty as I see it -- is that these forms aren't / can't find an audience due to the deathgrip of the  urlLink media industries ...  part of me knows that i want it both ways.  my imagination about artists finding audiences is shaped by my understanding of MASS culture.  An artist hasn't  "found" an audience, part of me says, until they've "made it big."  On the other hand -- the global monopolies & economies of scale that the  urlLink BIG SIX  are perpetuating -- are much of what gives rise to this notion of fame = success.  Sometime I should blog about celebrity being a format by which this hegemony is perpetrated -- but for now i'm interested  not in critique but in redemption!  I -- as a consumer -- as a human being -- as a fellow artist -- as someone who is moved by art -- want a way to access these forms of indymedia.    specifically, now, i'm refering to short films (though many of my thoughts translate well to the other forms).   I can watch short films at work (with some justification since i teach about these subjects) -- but not too many or too often -- and DSL service is expensive & if only DSL-ers should get to watch indymedia (/short films) than doesn't indymedia become an even more elitist, self-referential enterprise?   So that's why i'm excited about the idea of  urlLink microcinema .  and i'm excited enough about it to do something about it.  to try to start a  microcinema here in middle eastern OHIO.  but of course this is a back burner.  and my front burners are fairly demanding right now.  if you're a local reader (and most of you aren't) i'd love to hear how interested you'd be in volunteering to keep a microcinema organization up and running -- how regularly you'd support it (by coming)...what you think the major barriers would be...  heck I'd be interested in hearing that from non-local-ites...too...  part of me suspects that i should have as many blogs as i have "back burners" but that'd be more fragmented -- and my goal in this blog is -- i think to be more unified.  so that means that many of you aren't so into indymedia rants...but others of you aren't so into news about the kids...this is like having a debate inside of your head -- in public.   peace~

      mundane crisis - upcoming visitors - political compass - theological speculation  just before I left the office at noon yesterday -- Jerry Fliger (from BGSU days) called to say that he and Deb were in Akron and may drop in after lunch.  We do love drop-inners, but all the same i sped home to redd up a bit (note the VERY eastern-Ohio-vernacular use of "redd up"? a bit of impressive code switching, eh?).    As I walked in the doors, I found Lynn on her hands and knees.  Mark and Toby began our bathroom remodelling yesterday and just to get things started on an adventurous foot -- accidentally flooded the kitchen (through the ceiling) by knocking open a pipe.   It was a rains-it-pours moment.   we're looking forward to lots more friends this week.  Teddy for dinner tonight (Cedarville Ted), the Schandersons (of Shy Quiet People) for lunch tomorrow & Bei (from BGSU) for dinner on Thursday.  Lynn may off to BG on Friday to watch Scott (old student) play in the all state football game...  Took the  urlLink Political Compass  Test today.  Great stuff, if you're interested to know how you rank.  I've been speculating that I've been getting lefter and lefter, but who knew!  I outlefted Ghandi and Nelson Mandella -- and I even said that I believed in spanking! (not often and never in anger - in case we haven't conversed about this...)  Harry said some great things on Sunday-- he spoke of the difficulty of giving *and* receiving. A very nice interpretation of matthew 18.  I'll see if I can get a copy up and link to it later.  the idea is that abject dependency is the only way to receive the Kingdom of God.  So I was thinking -- how is it possible to enter that space of abject dependency given the careful wealthy way I live.  I have some answers brewing, but I don't like to think about 'em.  peace~

      Friends and Family!  Welcome to my blog.  It's not organized very conveniently.  Tho' this is going to be the site where I plan to keep track of the mundane bits of life that matter -- I also intersperse these mundanities with (*VERY LONG*) musings and meditations.  Feel free to fast forward past...(as if you wouldn't on your own...)  The idea that I keep this space as my "back burner" is supposed to allow me to keep a bunch of ideas simmering for a long time -- as they develop in my mind -- and now, hopefully, in community, and (theoretically) allow me to stay focused on my "real life" -- the "front burners" as it were.   Certainly that whole metaphor and the ascendant values are worth consideration on a different day!  Glad you're here!  Let me know (or not)!  Peace~

       - wedding description - epistemological coup - janson's dissertation - more ohio dissing  Well, the wedding is over.  Everything was beautiful. Laura and Erik’s SMILES gave me such joy that I started crying with inspiration / worship / happiness as I prayed with them after the lighting of the Unity Candle.  Their joy in each other was a beautiful mirror of the love God has for us.  BERlin was great – and when I re-read my last blog – I realized that I sounded much more anti-Ohio than I am or wanted to seem.  I love Ohioans.  Possibly I have more dear-friend-Ohioans than (could this be true, Michiganders?) any other state.  Ohio has been good to me.  I feel grateful for what I have gained here.   Berlin was great – despite its hardcore disneyfication of the amish (for you far-awayers – Holmes County, Ohio is one of the top three spots for Amish-tourism in the world)– because somehow, between all the stylization, the pace and the peace of the surrounding countryside and the centuries of tradition just FEEL like they pool around you slowing things down a bit.   Laura’s dad, Paul graciously had us stay in a hotel with the kids where Jaelyn swam a good twenty feet (all at once!) under water.  I have a keen sense that such news (look at my honor roll student! bumper sticker news) should be edited out of the blog in general, but twenty feet! Gosh!  I preached on First John 4.  I liked the stuff I came up with -- can't comment on how it was received.  My core reading of I john 4 -- knowledge of the Divine comes only through embodied love of those around us -- i think is a radical epistemological coup, but i tried to steer clear of such terminology...  Lynn and I are sitting in our living room waiting for Janson and Heather to arrive.  Jans, most of you know, is our still-in-school-since-we-graduated-college-together-11-years-ago-seminarian-friend who is dissertating on the book of NUMBERS – and its literary value.  Isn’t that great?!  The most demonized book by Christians – who – see – no – point – in – the – last – in – the – last – half – of – the – Pentateuch…and Janson suggests that the key to understanding the whole of scripture is right there in Numbers 1 – 10.  We always feel so deepened and motivated by listening to the ideas he's wrestling with. We’re meeting Heather for the first time, just after she’s finished meeting his sister and he’s meeting her sister for the first time (what a weekend!).  Then they’re driving back to Chicagoland tomorrow after church.   Hmmm.  I’m not really blogging about any of the ideas / issues that are on my figurative "back burner", so if, on the off chance that you’re reading for issue-centered narrative, forgive this purely event centered blog.  Oh wait – before I go - one more Ohio-diss.  On the way to Berlin we drove through Justus.  Now when you say Justus, Ohio – it sounds a lot like Justice – but, I always rant as I drive through (how downright intolerant and non-Buberian of me, this is), Just – US is a much more apt way of describing the outlook of the smalltown folk of the world.  Sure we’ll put a sign up announcing the name of our town – and while we’re announcing the name, perhaps we could try to chase away foreigners – we’ll name our town Just Us.  And if that weren’t enough the high school in town:  Fairless High School.  Just to be fair – if it were named Fairness high school, I’d have a joke, too, but please, I can’t let that connection go unrecognized – a town called Just Us and a high school named Fairless?  It’s like these people are the home of the villain in a comic book devoted to a superhero whose greatest attribute is her commitment to Justice – this little town is the yang to her yin. BTW ~ the two people I know who TEACH at Fairless ~ Rachel & Ben are anything but fairless. They’re wonderful teachers. So (!) devoted.  By this time Jans and Heather arrived, we talked for hours, slept for a few and it’s a beautiful Sunday morning.  The kids will wake any minute and we’ll start to get ready for church...so for now...  peace~

      WARNING: vegetarians beware! Skip to next post.  Gruesome animal preparation details ahead.  (healthy eaters, may want to beware too!)  yesterday was my day to be the full time stay at home dad.  As I am sometimes prone to do on such days – I put together a long-term cooking agenda.   First thing, we cooked bacon.  J, A & I ate it with our eggs, but it is important to note that the smell of bacon is very low on Lynn’s list of favorite sensations (eg. she doesn’t like it).  On the other hand, my very gracious hog-breeding brother in law supplies us with this delicacy often enough that we have a stock of it in my freezer.  So its very important to, on days where lynn will be gone for a long enough time, cook the bacon in the morning, and work to eliminate the smell all day.    Drat if she didn’t smell it on Jaelyn’s clothes as soon as she hugged her in the afternoon.  Note to Future Self: remember to burn the children’s clothes!  (What I need is Harvey Keitel’s pulp fiction character to come in to rid the house of the smell – can you just see Jaelyn, Addison and I, naked in the yard, getting hosed down by “the wolf”)  So later in the day – about two p.m., I used the bacon grease (now congealed nicely in the frig) to start a  urlLink roux  – eventually I added chicken flavored with chile, fresh corn cut from the cob, fresh tomatoes from the farmers market all over rice.  By the time I sat down to dinner I had already half downed a glass of cabernet savignon, fresh bread came out of the oven.  The kids played together happily as I prepared (this alone is a miracle).  Jaelyn fashioned the most amazing ostrich out of legos(she first said, this is a bird, and I was thinking – sure. Bird. It does look like an ostrich. Then SHE said it.  Ostrich. I didn’t even know she knew what an ostrich was.  Kind of  like the other day when we were under the tent and Abby and Jaelyn were pretending that the fireplace window was a movie screen – Jaelyn said they were watching Beauty and the Beast, and Abby protested – no it was the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.  Oh, I said, Jaelyn hasn’t seen that one.  She’s probably read it tho…but Jaelyn interrupted.  Yes I have, Dad.  At the Y. And with that teenager-correcting-her-impossibly-naïve-parents kind of voice.  I was stunned.  When did my four year old slip beyond my mind-control-capacity…) The world had this intense smile on her face and I felt as if the smile was directed completely at me.  So when  urlLink Over The Rhine ’s The World Can Wait played these words –   I want to feel and then some I have five senses I need thousands more at least  I repeated them aloud to Lynn (one of my more annoying traits, I’m sure, constantly creating pull-out quotes from the text of everyday life: bolding them, increasing the font, adding a fancy little box).  That’s exactly how I feel right now! I exclaimed.  Five senses are INADEQUATE to experience the world!  My friend Greg and I founded the Sensualists Club about seven years ago – he had the coolest of all sensory responses.  I think he’s trademarked this idea – but I’m gonna tell you about it anyway  --   It’s called the happy-hot-eared-food-buzz.  Like the buzz you’d get from alcohol, but it’s a sensation that you just get when your MEAL is really great.  (and he and Andrea make some really great meals).  Only its this focused buzz-type-thing in your EARS.  And its HOT. Isn’t that great?  I’m not sure that I’ve ever had it – but I’m SO glad that someone in the universe has it.    And quoting from OTR and talking about happy hot eared food buzzes together makes me think that I really should plug the OTR concert experience.  There’s something about Linford’s musical structures and Karin’s voice LIVE that is pretty amazing.  When I first heard them, I turned to the table I was sitting with and said, “I feel like my entire body just turned into a giant eardrum that won’t stop resonating.”    I just finished the novel  Secret Life of Bees  last night.  It is both a novel about sensual experience of the world (simply because Sue Monk Kidd writes such lush descriptions) and a novel about sensing God – sounds like the mystical tradition – a tradition that I have been drawn to – appealing to my interest in sensual experience *&* hearing God’s voice (two themes heretofore alluded to in this blog).  Anyway,  I was going to insert a section that I read last night which directly responded to my earlier blog about hearing God.  -----  [August tells a story about how her Grandmother once heard a hive of Bees singing the Luke 2 account of Christ’s birth.  The narrator giggles.]  -do you really think that happened?  -well yes and no, she said, some things happen in a literal way, Lily. And then other things, like this one, happen in a not-literal way, but they still happen.  Do you know what I mean?    I didn’t have a clue.  Not really…  -what I mean is that the bees weren’t really singing the words from Luke, but still, if you have the right kind of ears…you can hear silent things on the other side of the everyday world that nobody else can.   -----  And what i left out with my elipses would erode my argument if I were making one – but I’m not.  I just thought the passage was powerful about the possibility of hearing the Divine in the world around us.   Maybe I’ll return to those ideas in another blog…  Let me pause a moment, to note that I’ve rearranged my indexes over at the side.  I’ve added some connection points to friends that have web presences. It’s great to feel the possibility of connecting to y’all.  (Sense the incipient plug?  Where’s your web presence?)  I have to compliment my brother David, first family member to join me in the blog.  His  urlLink reticent yet reflective post  cracked me up.  i was trying to figure out whether or not Uday or Qusay was the jostler -- or if there were implicit Jacob / Esau, Cain / Able, Levi / Joseph implications in the whole "bad big brother motif"...?  I must also send a BIG shout out to my friend Glen who just successfully PH-d.  I truly look forward to reading his diss -- _Seeking Forgiveness_  (a far more impressive title than my laborious and dull -- CONSTRUCTING IDENTITY & blah, blah, blah...GARAGE SALES  We're off to Michigan tomorrow (if the day goes well) night & so my posts will be sporadic for the next week.  The same goes for email and voicemails out of commission here at casacommunitas right now...  peace~

        - rain & mortality -    its rainy today in canton.   abby & noah were at our house to play -- two two year olds and two four year olds -- means that you *don't* want a rainy day.   so when i got there, lynn had built the biggest friggin tent EVER out of chairs, couches, afghans, quilts.  it right near filled the whole livin' room.  multiple rooms. hallways. ahhh! nostalgic joy that came from building such tents.   with the humidity recurred a rattle in my trachea.  i had the same rattle (with deep breaths) through much of the month of june (rainy season).  But i never put it together with the rain until today.  using the spiritual-gift-of-worrying that i've started to learn from Lynn -- i just assumed it was the latent asbestosis that i've been waiting to kill me.  it's supposed to have a latency period of about 17 years.  I guess I should have about two more years before it kicks in (of COURSE i'm jesting -- i have no intention of dying that soon).   but it is remarkable what can stimulate thoughts of your own mortality.   and it is remarkable to think that 17 years have almost passed since I was 18 years old.    dazed and ancient, i bid you:   peace~

        - Theological nugget -   The readings in church were great today --   pulled together Genesis 1:28 - in the image of God were they made...  WITH  Matthew [...hmmm...] do we pay tax or no? whose IMAGE is on the coin?  Render to Ceaser that which is his, and unto God that which is his.  AND  2 Cor 5 therefore we are ambassadors pleading -- BE RECONCILED to GOD --  the connection of God's image being essential to human beings -- then the ways that so many forces have corrupted that divine image with instutional obligations, the worship of power -- and finally that the new tradition -- initiated by Christ is to call the whole world back into reconciliation -- the symbol of the Divine within us is like a sign cut off from its referent -- just like Baudrillard & Lyotard describe --   and our calling is to be calling to reconcile the world to its maker....  peace~ andrew

         - A post in which Andrew tries (vainly) to argue that his hysteria is not hysteria  -   A student   (who I like very much, in case you're reading, unnamed student) accused me in class recently of being a conspiracy theorist.    I thought of her accusation in the shower after I wrote the last email.    I think that there's a part of being reflective about shifts in the contemporary political climate (particularly if the shifts that you illuminate feature your own position as being one-down) that makes you sort of SOUND like a conspiracy theorist.    SO to distinguish my last post rant from a conspiracy theory, let me clarify how I am like and unalike conspiracy theorists: (how very aristotelian / rationalist of me)  1. conspiracy theorists always reveal a victim.  (I fall into this category.  I reveal the socio-political causes of the contemporary Liberals to be victimized.)  2. conspiracy theorists always allude to an extant body of secret knowledge. (I don't think I fit here.  I admire the righties for being able to harness a particular kind of populist rhetoric, but i don't think there's any secret knowledge submerged by them.  Au contraire -- I think its a particular work ethic, combined with a particular a-theoretical bent, a willingness to embrace media institutions, and a proficiency at using the free market to build their audience)  3. conspiracy theorists point to a body of poweful others who protect the secret knowledge & who victimize the victim (albeit indirectly).  (Here's another important point of divergence.  I DON'T believe in a "vast right wing conspiracy"  I think the right wing (like the left) is made up of a curiously diverse set of bedfellows who sometimes aren't even bedfellows, but in terms of ACCESS to the vast - American - middle, they have found (though not neccessarily cooperatively nor intentionally) some successful touchstones for reaching them.)  As always, I'm borrowing heavily from lots of influences for my ideas -- ri urlLink chard hofstadter   is responsible for the nice distinction of the constituent parts of conspiracy theories...  hope you're still sabbathing!  peace~ andrew

      on the way home tonight from Uncle Larry & Aunt Sally's Annual Square Dance (formerly the Leindecker holiday / event of the year -- surpassing even Christmas (I hypothesize its ability to articulate a symbolic grammar of nostalgia for farm life is the reason) some years -- this year just a good ol' time, less of a family time, possibly because of Grandma Cory's "passing."), Jaelyn and Addison had a little squabble so I turned around and told them a version of the story / interaction b/n Jesus & Andrew about how ongoing forgiveness must be...how living Jesus' teachings is HARDEST with our brothers.  JAELYN: Did they have sisters?  ADDISON: More!  Tell more.   JAELYN: Tell a story about their sisters, Daddy.  ME: Not sure that they had any sisters.  it's not really clear. [andrew resists the urge to here insert an editorial regarding feminist criticism of the biblical narrative.]  ADDISON: More!  Sisters, JayJay!  JAELYN: Yeah, Dad.  Tell a story about their sister, Jaelyn.  Of course this is all happening with lines over top of each other, so I'm still deciding on my response, when Jaelyn  intervened.  JAELYN:  "And their sister, Jaelyn, was talking to Jesus, and all of the sudden a SNAKE came up and wrapped around her leg.  Jesus took a knife and he CUT the snake.  He cut off its head.  He cut off its tail.  He cut all the parts of it."  Maybe I'm rearing a prophetess, because the way that she wound the Eden / serpent / He shall crush your head, you shall bruise his heel / Eve - Lillith imagery together was really quite impressive.  Anyone ready to name Jaelyn the next Ellen White or Joseph Smith...?  Hope your weekend included some...  peace~

       - RETRACTION NUMBER TWO (ish) -    Why have I been moved over to the NEW blogger posting box? Not a fan.  I like seeing MORE not LESS info on my screen.   This is public retraction 2 of the day, but I just wrote a long email psuedo-retracting an even longer conversation -- if i had a fortune cookie today it would say something like: You're life will be better off if you can undo breaking open this cookie..  Public Retraction Two:  urlLink David, my brother , is far more orderly, organized & Steven Covey Worthy than I am.    Which maybe made the whole thing about his a-futurism ( a new religion, perhaps?) so bizarre.   And lest you think that I spit in the eye of the sovreignity of God -- worrying, as I do, about what the morrow brings -- let me assure you that I *do* trust in the sovreignity of God, but I also trust that the sovreignity of God is partly responsible for my over-active need to DO. to MAKE. to ACHIEVE.  Right?  No?   It's late.  GregGibbs was here. Tonight.  Out of the blue.  Rich, deep, fun talks.  Always.  peace~

        - vacation summary - retraction - reflection -    we spent the last week in michigan.  drove from canton at 6 p.m. last thursday, returned to casacommunitas at 12:30 this morning.   during the trip up, lynn and i had some deep - dark and some deep - light talks...i felt much closer to her.  seems like talking / conversation -- the value we share most deeply and that binds us most fiercely to each other -- is always priced at a premium these days ...   spent several days with dave and linda in south haven, mi. we hadn't been there before, but it seemed just about perfect.  the extended gibbs family has been singing its praises in several keys for several years and so finally their witness broke through and i accepted this particular unique salvation.   what was the shape of this grace?    free bikes from our inn, so meandering conversational bike rides, plenty of great food, "committee meetings" galore, some hardcore sunburning on the shore of lake michigan, lots of rich dialogue about everything imaginable.   late one night, after my E self had pretty much vampired all the energy of the other three I's in the room....i proclaimed -- "that's all there is in the world!  memories and relationships!"    it still seems like a worthwhile axiom, but later we discovered that i had left out essential things like eating and tables in that particular equation...  hung out for a long time with each of my brothers and parents by the pool at geborgenheit.  with david was provoked by the shocking revelation that he doesn't think about the future.  no five year plan.  no ten year plan.  no thoughts of legacy or coherence.  just honesty and genuineness *now*.  with daniel we debated pacifism and then the redemptive arc hermeneutic...  which brings me to the  retraction  -- turns out that LYNN is NOT a pacifist.  she's just clearly opposed to the war we've most recently engaged in and thinking really hard about the implications of a commitment to nonviolence.    resultant self discovery: turns out that i am more likely to EMBRACE *then* consider when it comes to new positions.  this may be a helpful rubric for those of you struggling to justify my earlier self descriptions as *liberal* and *pacifist*.  i chalk this up to my 1.) penchant for hyperbole, 2.) my empathic strain, 3.) my procilivity to think outloud (i think marcia gave me the term "external processor"), & 4.) my tendency to want to think / be / perform outside of "the box". which, if you think about it, is kind of odd because this whole *embracing* thing just locks me into a new box...  sometime i'll devote a whole blog to how affixing our identities to the various discursive formations that surround us is always problematic and conflictual....but (big sigh of relief audience) not today.  have i fulfilled the promises of my title?  can i end for the day?    i do want to offer a shout out to John who is a new blogger and has a goshdarn deep  urlLink blog entry...   ~peace.

       - cushman contest update -   D. J. R. sent me an email address, but I've received no confirming email as yet from Joel, so (according to the contest rules) I can't declare him the winner until I confirm that this is -- indeed a legit email address.    Unfortunately for our programming sensibilities  urlLink Cushman  didn't starve in Europe.  In fact, he seems to have returned to a pretty normal life.  But his August 4 entry has an amusing quote -- particularly for those of you, who, like me have emerged from fundamentalism.....

       - crazy dream -   (bringing more bemusement to cedarvillians than to the unwashed....  I dreamed that Lynn and I went to Dr. D.'s funeral (knock on wood -- as far as I know he hasn't passed) &, surprise, surprise, it had quality stamped all over it.   Sorta.  Or maybe just bizarre carnivalesque stamped all over it.  We had to park downtown Cedarville, and I ran into Dave Hamblin (current Malone student) over by Lawlor Hall, only they had broken up Lawlor and were calling each wing a different name.  He lived in the back wing and when I asked if I could stop by to borrow a tie, he said sure stop by Unit 28 in Ashanti (hindu for peace).    Well I had to get going, because I knew things would be getting started.  I joined mom, dad, ang & lynn in the vestibule of the D.M.C. (which had been added onto with another vast floor above the existing one.  Floor to Ceiling window.  Candles burning EVERYWHERE and -- of course -- the pep band.  Trying to play staid music.    They were interupted by David Robey and Dave Ormsbe.  "Make no mistake," said Robey, "this depiction is true.  Jesus died as a virgin."   Suddenly there were torches and drums and sitars playing.  and actors dressed as roman soldiers and disciples and Caspar Van Dien dressed as Jesus.  He looked astonishingly like the White Jesus paintings that have dominated the last couple centuries of Jesus-depicting.  (BTW ~ went to  urlLink embody site  yesterday, and this is clearly some source material for the dream ~ look out its flash and you can probably only spend enough time if you've got a fast connection)  "Jesus" gave a speech on abstinence and gradually laid down on the floor in the middle of the crowd of Cedarville students come-to-mourn.  Roman soldiers hoisted his body up and took it away.    Inside the auditorium, the band had already started playing, but the band director came up to me (not anyone I'd ever met before) and let me know that he had met me last year at homecoming.  I smiled, nodded, shook his hand, played polite.  But he just stared at me like that meant like we had LOTS to talk about.    it's the kind of interaction that I imagine  urlLink Daniel  having on a regular basis with his parishioners. (btw ~ if you have a weak stomach, beware that last link).  So then I had to go give my regards to Pat D. who had taken to a large queen size bed right there in the foyer.  Gloria was in a chair by her bedside, telling her a hilarious story about getting lost on the way to the funeral.   She was laughing and laughing until I started talking, I was relating a story about cleaning out my closet.  Pat just turned over and went to sleep.  I slipped into the auditorium where Jeff Beste was leading the congregation in hymns.  Incense was burning everywhere. Pew candles at the end of each pew were lit and there were thousands of people there.    John Ruhlin (Malone student) got up and gave a talk about the inevitability of scientific theory catching up with theology eventually.  Only he was absolutely too smart for me to understand.  (that's when I knew it was a dream.... JUST KIDDING!)  It is when i started waking up...  well, we leave for our last pilgrimage of the summer later today so the blog will be relatively silent for the upcoming week.  hope you become deeper and truer this week.  and that you rest.  that may be one of my resolutions this schoolyear -- REST as a spiritual discipline.   (so far the list is: 1.spend time with non-students, 2. feel more, think less.)  peace~

      - fell asleep at nine last night.  think i'm overtired.  sorry i didn't call you, Gary (if you're reading) & Brendon (pretty sure you're not)  - rumour is that Brendon (et. al.) up and moved to Austin TX -- where I've been wanting to visit for quite some time -- still -- sad to have him go so far...   - had a family movie night last night because, i think, both parents were so exhausted that that was the only feasible toddler survival strategy.   - got some relieving news at work -- a major stressor has been removed! (not tenure & promotion -- still slaving away on that...)   - the tile we want for the bathroom is on backorder for two weeks -- so the project will be on hold once the walls are sanded and painted.  so far it looks airy & light.  so opposite from the 70s ski lodge that its been for so many years.     - speaking of TandM construction (who we love) --  urlLink Toby  is blogging now! Welcome, Tob!    - we leave for myrtle beach on friday for a week with the in-laws. Jan asked some incredibly probing insightful questions about family relations while she visited.     - Addison is cutting molars and so has this psychotic edge which suddenly appears in the middle of his otherwise: cute, happy, laid back personality.   - our basement is almost dry from last weeks floods.  had to throw out the old mint green carpet that we had salvaged from the last owners of our house.  what a loss!   - Trena successfully shot her whole film over the weekend! Kudos to crew!   -  urlLink Jared' s grandfather passed away -- (see his blog for details)   - life feels pretty much like a list right now.  ah the marriage of form and content...  ~peace.

       - hollywood crumbles - listening for the Divine -   last year's roommate Katie stopped by yesterday for a long catch-up.  it was great to hear her infectious lefter, be regaled by her anecdotes & hear about her plans -- which are nebulous --   this occupational hazard of finding friends in your students -- it turns out -- means that you go through the "vocational" struggle a thousand times more than you (in this case me) already have...  so Katie spent a year in Hollywood and found that the sheen faded quickly. Its been an interesting year for me -- because for years,  i have spent so much of my time / energy writing-toward-hollywood -- and yet the sheen was deeply dulled by Katies experience -- and now my friend Gary's financier has backed out of his promised movie -- more darkness falls...  i know that these are archtypal hollywood tales, but i felt ill-prepared to receive them on behalf of MY friends.  And unready for how much they would distress my own faraway - exotic - other - midwesterner's - sheen - over - hollywood....  I find it interesting that through such gut-punches to the "original dreams" -- some part of the "dream" usually stays intact -- possibly grows stronger.  is that pride and stubbornness?  -- or a trustworthy impulse --   For me -- my devotion to storytelling remains undiminished...  Jan (THE Jan, from which Jaelyn's name is half-derived) is in from MN & had dinner with us & ended up crashing here when the thunderstorm started.    She's just started working with a Spiritual Director -- something Lynn and I are very interested in --   This woman suggested that she start by LISTENING for God.  And gave her a great word picture.   And so -- of course -- I plied her (Jan) with my summer-long question: but HOW?  HOW do we listen for God?   Jan relayed that the woman suggested that the experience would be different for everyone -- some a palpable hearing or feeling or seeing.  Some through dreams or ....  And suddenly a light came on for me.  I do think that I hear God when WRITING.   Ted called me back to journaling as a discipline earlier this summer when he visited.  It was an awkward prophetic moment, as I suppose all friend - prophetic - moments - in - kitchens are --   but for the last month his words have been taking root in me, and when Jan said this -- it felt as if it came together for me.   When I'm writing, I think I'm best at discernment, insight, elaboration.   And I said in an earlier blog I hear God speak through the contours of my life, my story, but that doesn't seem as much an instance of divine INTERVENTION & PRESENCE-- which is really what I'm looking for -- special evidence in an de-magical-ized world.  I'm verging on the sort of blogging that would make Lynn blush because, as she so aptly puts it: "what kind of person would do that?  Journal?  and then show other people?!"  Mist left behind from the fierce rains of the night is drifting over the trees all around our neighborhood.  Its already 6:18 a.m., but it looks like it could be night -- a bright night -- or day -- a dark dark day.  I love the in-betweens.  peace~

       - what happened yesterday -    So much happened yesterday.  If I wax essayistic about each *thing*, I could write an alternate universe.    So I'll try adapting the idiom of the internet -- brevity.  Ang & Ryan moved.  (after a long battle with U-Haul clerks who were annoyingly friendly)  Mark & Toby successfully installed the upstairs toilet! (no more midnight treks down two flights of stairs!)  Jeff, with my cowardly help, transported a SKUNK in our mini van from Marcia's back yard (it had lived under her house) to the local park / frisbee golf course. (Wives & Kids cheered as "Sonja" ambled through the grass to her new life.)  A woman in A & R's church told them, just before they went to sleep Saturday Night that a woman SHOT herself in their bedroom.  Where they have lived for the last year.    And though Ang didn't say this -- I'm pretty sure that this is a secret that their whole church has been keeping from them.  (The house they lived in is the "youth pastor house" for a string of youth pastors.)  Of course my interest in the story is primarily Proprietary --   PITCH: young couple moves from house where ghost has lived unbeknownst to them.  Ghost liked their life so much that she moved WITH them -- but started to act up once she was in a new * place *.      TOBY's ICING on the PITCH: The couple's spending all this effort trying to figure out how this ghost came to be in their new (older) home -- combing through history, etc... but they'll never find a record there, will they?  Because THEY BROUGHT the ghost from their home.   Dunh, dunh, dunh.  Addison slept in his NEW BIG BOY bed for the first two times yesterday and last night.  No problems.  He loves it!  Aunt Jan comes to town today! The whole family's excited...  peace~

       - mysteries of blogging - see cushman starve – please forgive! -    One of the most interesting dimensions of blogging, dear audience, is that *  urlLink you  * may very well not exist.    I may devote earnest efforts to conjure you (emails, subtle references to blogcontentn in F2F conversation)...  But – in the end – you may or may not exist (/read).  Who knows?   COMBINE this mystery of blogging with another delightful one –   The relative invisibility of existing bloggers.  Try to find this blog with a search engine.  I dare you.  I don’t think you can do it.  Well actually as long as you use the EXACT NAME of the blog -- you can do it, but you only know the name because you've been here.  Just try to find the blog without that specialized knowledge...pretty hard, eh?  * but * even once you “find” “me” – JUST by reading you * still * can’t “reach me.”  Try to find (I dare you) a way to respond to me on this page.   Hunh?  Can’t do it! Its crazy!  If I actually PAID blogspot for this space – there would be a space for comments – but I’m cheap, and (frankly) a little afraid of my ability to stay “true” to blogging…so for now i'm a freeloader...  So the truth is that not only are many blogs unfindable / invisible, but they are also unrespondable – rendering them doubly invisible.  WHICH BRINGS ME – to my point....  I found my friend  urlLink Joel’s blog  a couple of weeks ago, and have enjoyed watching him trek through Europe…hearing his refreshing, hilarious, passionate voice again….BUT…  Even though I’ve found him.  I can’t * reach * him.  He doesn’t know that I’m listening.  That I exist (in cyberspace at least)  So my idea was -- I'll put it up as a contest on my blog -- first person to send me Joel's email address wins.  Since everyone's connected by six degrees of separation anyway -- it shouldn't be too hard.  BUT as if this were a fox-network-blog – there's a twist.  Here’s the latest entry from “cushman”:    Tuesday, July 29, 2003  Quite possibly the most amazing two days I've had. Amazing in the sense of me going completely homeless core. Jenkins and I went homeless all night in Milan waiting to catch our flight. Today has consisted of me in downtown Brussels constantly looking for a bed down in city parks; also trying to conserve my last euro coins; At one point I actually thought about going begging; Tonight I'm stranded by Marcus and am hoping to bed down in the Brussels airport; possibly the most hard core I've gone in awhile; Despite me being almost out of euros; I'm digging on this experience.  - posted by Joel @ 12:00 PM   Making up hipster language like "homeless core" is just like Joel!   And for him (unlike if I tried to do it), it works!  But despite his ability to use language well, apparently, he's disappearing into poverty in Europe somewhere.  Possibly Brussels.  Running out of Euros to eat (but still blogging -- that's heroism -- a sense of the tragic frame!  if you must die in poverty, make sure you do it with an audience (see _Rent_)).    Who knows what’s happened to Joel since?  My little contest * could * be a very short - lived reality – show – style - blog - quest.    If we don’t find him soon – we may very well -- in hyperreal time – See Cushman Starve.  Of course, if I were a normal guy and this were a normal blog the whole thing would have said, “Hey! Anybody know my friend Joel Larson from BG?  Do you read his cushman blog?  Do you have his email address?”  But that’d be way too easy.    Besides this way – maybe I'll come up with prizes...   urlLink Happy International Forgiveness Day!     Be sure to keep forgiving everybody that you need to…it’s the hardest work we can do as humans.  As my Newcastle Ale cap read the other day:  “life’s too short to be bitter.”  (in terms of beer, I disagree, but in terms of forgiveness – Amen!)  Peace & Forgiveness ~

      Great news!  I discovered the perfect book to write.  No really, this one is perfect.  So I told Lynn.  LYNN: That's great, honey.  I'm going for a walk down to the souvenier shops.  ANDREW: Fine. Be dismissive, but I'll maybe, probably have it halfway done by the time you get back from your walk.   LYNN: Really.  That's great. Really.   *portions of the previous dialogue may have been vaguely fictionalized to sustain the greater truth of the interaction.   (yes, i mean *my* truth.)

       - axiom of the day - vacation update - getting everything done (in theory) -    Favorite  urlLink Gloria  - ism:   There are no bored people in the world.  Only boring people.   My mother comes from two parents who are eminently quotable, poignantly axiomatic.  And she is too.  There's something that emerges from that kind of culture.  At least I have an ability to articulate many of the base / core / deep-seated values that make me who I am.  This is one of them.    There are several other great axiom that are in both of my parents' vocabularies which also explain some of the core Rudd-tendencies that  are both my greatest assets (/resources if *assets* sounded too braggadocios) and yet bewilder me in such core ways too.  With the enneagram ? I don't like hearing that I ifnd it hard to let others be in charge - but on the other hand - I do find it difficult to believe that the average anybody else will give something the kind of treatment that I think it needs.    Is that a messiah complex?   Am I journaling out loud in inappropriate ways?   We're in Myrtle.  Gary rented us a cottage and it has the most amazing screened in porch facing the wave.  Nestled into a dune.  Lynn's sunning on the deck next to me.  It's a hard life.    Jaelyn took to the waves like a mermaid separated from an old friends.  Addison (still trying to shake a 24 hour flu-ish thing) is more tentative. He likes it, but from a safe distance.  But the digging of Hooles (his pronunciation) is enough to keep him happy forever.   I'm reading a book Get Everything Done and Still Have Time to Play which is challenging.  The author does seem to have a big box around the idea that individuals get to make choices for themselves (which Lynn identified as a modernist / industrial - corporate - male mindset -- I agree), but I also really agree with his analysis that we often choose to do things with less resistance (eg. blog) when we meet resistance in the tasks that are more core to the values that we have.  His analysis?  We end up with too much paper, feeling too stressed, always behind, never complete, and needing more time.  His core idea?  There's no such thing as time management.  Only attention management.  We can choose how much attention we give to tasks and issues but we only get the same amount of time everyday.  Big problem?  We don't get to choose our attention by ourselves.   Or at least we shouldn't. (says Andrew, not Forster)  Such choices should be made in concert, in communion, in tandem with the communities we live with and in.  But I probably shouldn't throw out the baby (attention management -- attending more intentionally to our choices) with the bathwater (his modernist, corporate maleness).   Sometime I'll get into a blog / a thought about the western-ness of his preconceived individual.  How an eastern WV might differently conceive of a person within the nexus of their relationships / expectations / heritage / resources / etc?  And the other question that lingers for me there is -- to what degree is our choice-making, rational individual (championed by apologist Ravi Z. as a sufficiently worthwhile accomplishment of Christianity / Western Religion ? and some version of that claim is echoed by Daniel Boorstein in the creators) --really emergent from Christian theology (in opposition to Hindu / Confuscian ways of thinking-being) and to what degree is that a product of the modern ? western ? rational ? (mostly) Christian worldview that has shaped the culture I grew up in...  I know I can bait at least my brother (DJR) with that question -- can't I?   And what are the implications of all this thinking upon the metaphor underlying this blog?  That our attention can be _back burnered_?  I?m worried that these thoughts (you must seize the day! Be a choice maker!  Choose your destiny!) may undermine my commitments to discursively BEING (present) in this realm?  peace~

      - did the back burner go out? -  Toby walked in tonight and said, "I checked your blog and decided that your back burner was on the back burner."   He's right.   School is starting.  Freshman have been arriving all week. We've just (finally!) finished hiring two new (one semester & one year) faculty members.    Daniel and Andrea just left after three days of lots of fun (they were patient and allowed our fun to flow in and around a hundred meetings / activities / etc....).    The joke of the weekend became me turning to Andrea and saying, "has it been ten minutes?  Can I tell you another student-story?"  I've said before (somewhere) that I consume people -- not devour or prey, mind you, but I just get resourced by BEING WITH.    So I'm pretty excited about my job right now.   Despite the fact that the principalities and the powers of this world have been trying to thwart that excitement-- (eg. a long speech about how the most important thing that a Malone Faculty Member could do to Raise the Standard of Excellence (not something I'm all that interested in anyway -- is a commitment to the nebulous inheritance of arete' my birthright as an American -- i've done "quality-stamped-all-over-it", thanks, and I'm not goin' back) *by* (and this is the kicker) lowering our average GPA score & increasing the reading we assign (not the depth of or value in -- just the page amounts) -- despite these cultural norms of pedagogical evil -- I'm excited to be returning to the classroom.  And the hallways and the office and the yellow chair.  The Great Bathroom Renovation is nearing completion.  My syllabi are really close to being ready to being printed up.  Addison learned the difference between the nominative and objective cases in reference to one's self today.  Jaelyn is about to start Dance Lessons next week.  Lynn likes her first year students quite a bit(though she's pretty tired tonight).  The new _Over The Rhine_ CD is still (so far) living up to expectations -- and I'm looking forward to watching _All the Real Girls_ -- finally out on video and available in the midwest this week.  I hope your front and back burners are burning brightly...  Peace~

       - ouch - good trip - the plan -    I'm feeling the  squeeze  of the schoolyear keenly.  Even though we're still a week out from start date.  I feel like we're at week seven (which is perhaps the worst for me -- in a fifteen work semester -- by week eight, i just surrender to the tide).  I'm keenly aware that my backburner space looms large, luminous and luscious in the summer. (little cross - reference to my baptist-exegetical-preaching-featuring-the-age-old-memory-device-of-alliteration-which-can-handily-parse-almost-any-scriptural-passage-upbringing)  And I'm feeling it shrink to a half-operational bunsen burner already.  what will it be like at literal week seven?    Good Trip  (above) refers to Myrtle Beach.  Living with my in-laws in a vacation house on a beach is always an adventure.  It's just funny to me to be in the fusion of Beach Culture (as I've experienced it) and Farm Culture.  Lynn's Dad and Brother have an internal alarm clock which is a feature of their years / life as hog farmers that goes -ding- somewhere between 4:30 a.m. and 5 a.m..  I try to make my way to the public space to write by 5 - 5:30 everymorning, but I was continuously shocked to find OTHER PEOPLE awake!   And then Keith was up by 6:30 -- ultimately there was only one day where anyone slept past 7:30.    The upside?  Lynn and I were looking at each other on the couch by nine each night with the eerie silence of post-apocalyptic desertion.  Everybody was in bed.   Big full moons over the ocean every night.  Wide beautiful swaths of (relatively) un-touristed beach.  Hilarious ongoing laughter of Jaelyn and Keith romping wildly  in the shallow surf.  Waveboarding huge 15 foot waves.  Oh -- and the other feature of Farm Life.  COOKING. Hardcore Cooking at EVERY meal.  ALWAYS sausage or bacon in the morning WITH eggs, pancakes, etc...ALWAYS a HOT lunch (they call it Dinner).  And big, endless dinners.  The whole getting-naked-on-the-beach-thing was an odd yang to the yin of dinner.  So here's  the  blog  plan  for the semester.  I'm gonna *try* to put some words up here every other day minimally -- but I do want to stay committed to the front burners and fronter-back-burners that I should be.  Be assured, though, dear reader, if you're blogging and I have your address, I'm reading you a lot more than I'm writing! I love the ability to be *with* my friends even while so far away.    If you are one of the loyal (two? three?) readers who reads every day -- then you'll recognize that I've broken one of the rules of the non-cyber-universe.  I've gone back in time and revised my plan as it was first published.  With no indication of what it used to say!  Who knows what will happen to Marty McFly now?  will he disappear from the photo first?  or will the Libyan Terrorists in the minivan kill the professor?  Peace~

      The world is so full of humanness.    I press up against my students, 33 of them crammed into a little room with brick block walls and big metal window frames letting in the spare light of courtyard, not really bright enough to liluminate the thin yellow chalk on the greenboard.    They're all taking quizzes and making guesses about "right answers" and i know, secretly thinking through the next hour, their day, their lives.  I try to engage them, to take on their lives and perspectives and burdens in order to make the words and ideas I have to give them deeper and richer and better, and I feel exhausted.    It feels like we can only bear so much of the loads of those around us.   President Johnson (prez of the college) today addressed the undergrads and told them that to hear God's purpose for their life, that they couldn't look to their own dreams and ambitions -- that they needed to surrender to God's ambition.    His source Rick Warren's _Purpose Driven Life_ -- I knew that the book was everywhere (when I saw a trucker at a greazy spoon in Nowhere, Indiana (on a road trip this summer with Erik) reading it over breakfast) despite my lifelong vows against Christian bookstores...but please tell me, somebody, that Rick isn't opposing our will (in any sort of natural or given way) to God's will?  Because shouldn't our dreams and goals spring in some way from the riches of God's common grace?  Shouldn't our longings be evidence / witness to the creative and sustaining powers of God.   And by the way, Daniel is an anti-calvinist.  And I can't figure out in retrospect whether he thinks that God doesn't call the elect, that the elect do not perservere, or that God just isn't neccessarily omniscient.  One of these I agree with.... Readers?   Yesterday Addison wouldn't go into the basement without me.  He was convinced.  CONVINCED that a Lion would be down there.  He played out the whole scenario for me over and over.  Go downstairs.  ROAR! me: DAD! come. Stick. Poke. DIE!  Most of his syllogisms end in bloody deaths.  The fastest one is no seatbelt.  He shakes his head, says "on?" and that's the only link needed -- "DIE!"  ahhh  my pacifist children.  (note: not pacifistIC.  IC on the end of words is increasingly my MOST hated misuse of the English language -- or at least of Suffixes.)  My brother  urlLink David  is writing some funny stuff about Pirates these days.    peace~

      - the front burner heats up -   so now i'm just blogging about how my job is taking over my whole entire life.   i don't think that there could possibly be a more boring blog to read.  Dale Soden from Whitworth College came to campus last week to talk to the faculty and he talked about how central to the life of the faculty member it was to be helping our students think careful about  meaningful vocation.    I couldn't agree with him more.  I've felt deeply enmeshed in the struggle of MANY of my students (some of you are reading?) -- unsure of where and how they fit in the world.    Harry decided to preach a series on vocation though (so now is the time to come and visit if its applicable and you're interested).  This morning he talked about how hearing God's call was often about forcing yourself to listen to the shape of who *you* are.  What is it that you love? long for? enjoy? take pleasure in?   *AND* forcing yourself NOT to listen to all the seductions and expectations that feel so natural (money, security, normalcy, parents' expectations).  It was very moving.  This summer I think that I'm starting to think (and yes, that sentence needs to be just that circuitous) that maybe this teaching thing *does* / *could* fit my calling after all.  Certainly, I'm increasingly convinced that the bueracracy of higher (and most other levels) ed. is *not* a good fit -- but that maybe the things that I love:   - telling stories  - casting vision  - intuiting truth - building friends  can find a home in this profession.  Not that they couldn't have found "home" in another profession -- and certainly I never set out in this direction...  I do become increasingly convinced that more often than not our CALLING (vocatio) does not *fit* well with the jobs and the institutions and the places and the flow of money that exist in the world.  Isn't that part of what it means to be strangers and aliens.  I wrote in a card to Lynn about 6 months ago that i felt "set adrift in life".  that felt scary and awful to me then.  (I remembered the feeling when i saw the card on the counter today -- it fell out of her Bible maybe?) The truth is that I still feel that drift, but am maybe becoming more convinced that the sense of chartedness and destiny that i thought was driving me forward was purely rhetorical construct -- and that we're all trying to make our drifting meaningful by telling stories.   Of course I don't want to demean those stories.  I live for them.  (I'd like to MAKE A LIVING telling them.)  But I also want to free myself to enjoy the drift.  To acknowledge the possibility and the playfulness that exists in the limin and betweenness.  If you're my brother, you're "blah, blah, blah"ing the screen right now.  If you're my grandma you're shaking your head, "that boy!"  if you're my mom, you're hearing me depict my brothers and grandmother publicly and saying, "andy!"  so that's my cue to shut up.  happy school start, teachers, parents & students everywhere.   peace! ~andrew  (p.s. if you're my sister Angela, you're nodding intensely, listening as I ramble, seeming *so* interested...but possibly you're just on screensaver mode...)

      If I have to put on clothes one more time, I’m going to scream.    I laced up shoes, like, FOUR times yesterday.  And I wore flip flops to work!    (went to the Y, in and out of the toddler room twice, getting out of the pool and getting ready in the first place)  What a waste of a day.  Putting on SOCKS, SHOES, Zipping up pants, buckling them, buttoning up shirts.  Aargh!  Some people hypothesize that the effects of the fall of man were that nakedness became the private domain.  Being something of an exhibitionist, I’m not too fond of this explanation.   Others suggest that the fall introduced shame and clothes & nakedness are a good metaphor for this shame.  Sure, I can go with them on the clothes part at least – certainly clothes are constantly making us feel inferior.  Some say that the fall alienated us from one another (and God) and that clothes are just an expression of that alienation (which is obviously linked to the other two).  Right, right.  I certainly feel alienated. Who doesn’t?   I’m thinking that a better explanation than all of these things would be that the punishing implication of the fall was not any of the theoretical domains above, but that we would be pushed by all of *these* sociological phenomena (shame, alienation, privacy) to have the very *embodied* punishment of lacing up corsets and tennis shoes and buttoning shirts and tying ties.  All of which, notably are not extensions of these large scale human problems (sh, al, & pr) but are hybrids of their effects when mixed with the hubris of …  Dunh, dunh, dunh,   Fashion.   Aaargh.  (sorry, Elaine, I'll justify fashion in a different blog)  So, you may ask, are you, like, typing this blog while NAKED?!  Well I obviously can’t answer that question without changing the rating on the backburner….  (BTW, I am not now, nor ever have "into" wearing corsets -- I was just trying to describe a historical arc of falleness.)  Feeling free for now~

      My student / friend Trena writes about  urlLink art & meaning  . read her tuesday august 26th blog.  My old friend Amy (who may not even remember that I exist on the planet, but I really like my parasocial relationship with her blog/media-self) writes about  urlLink art and meaning  too (her august 29th blog).  I post some  urlLink updates  (half - ready to be posted) about my art.  And goshdarnit if the meaning would ever be allowed to emerge from that project (sitting in little tapes in a small room in the basement of the college library...waiting to be *transformed*.  But  my new website  urlLink "look"  is up -- and half finished.  i'm going home to be with my family for a few hours before i return to the ugly world of tenure and promotion...

Lynn and I are trekking back to Cedarville for homecoming this year.  It's an odd year to go for us -- but we're sure that we'll bump into all kinds of good friends...  Right?   Anyone else coming?  urlLink Email  us & say so!  (BTW ~ that "YES" was to Erin's as-yet-unidentified query about whether we would indeed be going to Cedarville for homecoming this year...)

      1. did you read yesterday's blog?  read it before proceeding.  2. water is by far my favorite element.  i'm sure David will make fun of me for saying so...but I *am* a pisces & those underwater scenes in _Rushmore_, _The Graduate_ & _BottleRocket (& on...) move me.  I *get* it.  I do feel ancient longings for Atlantis....  3. This morning.  After I got out of the shower (5 a.m.) -- I hear someone splashing around in a tub downstairs.  Only there is no tub downstairs.    Water is pouring through the ceiling.  Through every light fixture (and there are a bunch of them).  I fill two buckets by wringing towels into the buckets.  The water touching my skin keeps me from feeling distressed or stressed.  I'm grateful that Lynn is sleeping still, as a Capricorn water has NO ability to calm her.    4. As I made coffee this morning at the office (something I do every morning), water splashed everywhere.  The counter, the burner, the sink even the carpet.   Water is pouring out of my life.  CLEARLY a portent of something to come?  Any predictors?  soothsayers among you?

      - labor day weekend - watched the hours - the threat of the mundane -   celia bought a house, so i watched abby & noah while Lynn, Linda & Jeff helped strip floors, paint ceilings, etc...  we (the kids and i) had a good time.  i introduced a new character to them -- a guy by the name of "Fester" -- who, for those of you from *back* in the day, must be related to "Herman."  Everybody loved him.  They loved the fact that I denied knowledge of his existence and that he only arrived when I left the room, but when Fester accidentally sprinkled water over their heads (he's a clumsy guy) -- Noah freaked.  it became clear that Fester's presence and/or my schizophrenia about the whole thing had been nurturing a fabric of fear.   on the way back from celia's house I thought about blogging about feminism -- i've never heard celia use the word -- but lynn and she and i together mourned the cedarville torch that celebrated "God's Plan for Men and Women" and laid out the women's section in pink showing her carrying a laundry basket, pushing a vacuum and caring for kids -- while the men's blue section showed him returning from his white collar job and in another photo fixing the garage door opener.    when i woke up this morning i didn't feel as much like blogging that --  even though I thought that watching _the hours_ last night would make me feel that way.  I do recommend the book with two thumbs up.  I thought the movie was good, but not the kind of movie that I recommend to all audiences.  If you're of the PBS / BBC / Merchant-Ivory persuasion, you should definitely see it.  but it didn't -- the movie didn't convince me to blog about feminism, that is.  It convinced me to blog about something else.  Which I'll return to in a moment after I go ahead and argue against that torch for a moment.    I've already set up this "issue" in my mass media class -- by suggesting that the traditional structure of the home whereby a woman stays at her home and cares for her children while the husband goes out to a job, works an eight hour day and returns home in the evening is more a product of the industrial revolution than it is of scripture.   (i know that i'm blogging to the choir for many of you)  But these pictures in the Torch just pointed up some of the most egregious "sins" at the cultural level of this system.  That a woman's entire day be filled up with "invisible repeatable tasks" (care for the domestic sphere) and that that work be linked somehow to her (own personal and that of those around her's) evaluation of her ability to be "a good mother" -- seems ludicrous and wrong to me.    I do think that good parenting for mothers and fathers does include accessibility.  And I'm happy to Prophecy against the cultural narrative that separates parents from children just to maintain a pattern of acquisition and consumption.  That's  *another* cultural metanarrative that I find myself resistant to -- the endless importance of consumption for purposes of identity formation and leisure pursuit.  But its fathers as much as mothers that need to be *present* in the lives of their children.  AND the idea that a woman is responsible *only* for her own family seems another byproduct of this system that is deeply wrong.  Women *need* (as much as and in the same way as a man needs) to cultivate their gifts and callings in contexts which allow them to impact some portion of the world.   Whence comes this rant?    Years and years and suburbs upon suburbs of people who use religion to prop up the traditional work-model of the nuclear family?  yes, partly. the ongoing exhaustion and frustration of trying to shape a life where both parents make room within their jobs and careers for children WHILE also pushing both careers forward *but in a world with no models* and a world where there is little *systemic support / institutional support* for such choices? yes, partly. the fact that i just heard through the grapevine that one of my bright students, just starting her career is going to quit her new job because she unexpectedly got honeymoon pregnant? yes, partly (I didn't hear any discussion about what her husband would do with his job.) the fact that when i ask (some of) my friends if they've considered paternity leave once their babies are born they look at me like  i must surely be joking...  BUt I decided not to blog about feminism, remember?  Because as I watched the hours and watched the torture that each woman felt their life to be -- just because it had been constrained in ways that they did not expect nor want --   I was again focused on how broken the whole world is.  How disappointed everyone is.  How much we want, and how little we have.  How disconnected we all are from the people who mabye could meet us in a *real meeting* way.  I was moved by the way that, in the film, *touch* was the transcendent opportunity that everyone had.   I was thinking that we walk around in our worlds filled with invisible lepers and all of us have hands that heal just a little bit if we can bother to / find a way to / defy conventions of "appropriateness" by *touching* one another.   ...but i'll have to leave off in the middle of the sentence because two toddlers are suddenly awake and feeling needy. ah the irony...  ~peace.

      Someone wrote this somewhere on the web:   "Nothing is ever difficult or complicated. Think less."  Apparently that's both *advice* + *axiom.*  Maybe only one who believed in the axiom could afford to give the advice.  Maybe only someoe who had followed the advice could even come up with the axiom.

      I carry this case around campus this year -- it's two toned, orange and tan and was probably produced in 1955 or thereabouts.  It effectively functions as my "briefcase" (a term / idea / object that doesn't really "turn my crank" -- I swore I'd never carry one)...which is great because it's much larger than any "briefcase" i've ever seen...so i can replicate the chaos/hope/&possibility with which my desk is replete --  (or... "it's messy inside my briefcase like it is on my desk.")  But what's interesting to me is that I get all these comments about it from other faculty.   "You got a record player in there?"  "Bringing your trumpet to class?"  "Mmmm." (with a shaking head -- Julia eventually told me that her dad carried an identical case when he travelled -- and filled it with his hard liquor)  "You look like some kind of salesman."   "What *is* that?"  I love the idea that the objects and relations of a person's everyday self could act as a sort of stimuli for questions....  My mom always said that I was confused about the point of clothes; that I was under the impression that clothes were costumes.    Well, she was at least right about the second part.  I certainly think that clothes are costumes.    For everybody, though, I think they are.  I just happen to think the character I'm playing should probably be a little more quirky than the rest of the cast...  peace~

      today is my first meeting with my tenure and promotion committee -- hence the silence for the last little while.  The front burner is dominating.    Actually lots of little backburners are going and going strong, but I don't have time to write them into community...  sorry to all whose email remains unanswered -- hopefully *part 2* of my week will yield a little more connection - time.  my brother turned me on this blogger quiz -- I'm not usually about such quizzes -- but I must admit bloggings been a bit of an obsession for the last few months.    the whole experience has illumined for me, though, a little bit, how and when i'm devoted to face to face.  When i do and don't feel okay about making personal boundaries.    but i'd better stop...i'm launching into a little burner.  don't have time.  gotta work on appendix 2A B -- dealing with Criterion 2 a. (2.) (f.) -- gotta love life in bureaucracy...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANGELA! (my little sister -- not so little any more is turning twenty two, buying a house and succeeding at her first real job.  Well she hasn't said she's succeeding -- but -- c'mon! She's a Rudd!)

       - saturday. finally. -   it's an archtypal saturday morning.   we woke up late.  (i haven't woken up late since I decided to be a more serious writer -- as most of you know 5 am is my date with my muse.) I had echinacea tea, j & a joined Lynn for some chai tea.  She picked up an obsession from Andrea G. & the kids have joined her in her devotion to the stuff...  J & I both have the coughing, sneezing, sniffling, sneezing croup so HONEY in my tea (since I read _secret life of bees_ this summer, I have the sneaking suspicion that honey *is* the cure for everything) was great.  Been listening to coldplay parachutes loud.   The kids are playing in the new sandbox grandpa garry just built them yesterday (read: that's not a sandbox -- that's a SMALL BEACH.)  The whole family ate popcorn and watched the neverending story last night.  We've been fielding questions from Jaelyn about "what *is* the -nothing- though?" all morning.  I'm imagining a psuedo sci fi story where the nothing (eg. anti matter, black hole) slowly approaches the earth, and there are religious wars in churches, which are, along with casinos and brothels and prisons -- packed out....but the whole story wouldn't be about the world coming down (and i'm thinking that the world-coming-down story would be gentle and inevitable like the short story _The Ceiling_ and the novel _Blindness_ - not like the movie _Armageddon_) it would be about a religious conflict over whether or not different END TIMES theological frameworks (the kingdom coming, the rapture, the millenia, the apocalypse) could be REALLY HAPPENING in the approach of the coming nothing or if the coming nothing signalled something else.  Kind of like a theological debate in the style of the _Name of the Rose_ -- only not quite so death-and-destruction as that story....  Eh?  And we put an offer on a house closer to Malone and it was accepted and now our house is on the market and we have to paint our kitchen ceiling, fix our bathroom (downstairs) walls, put in a little flooring, make up for three years of bad gardening plus the onslaught of fall...and we're signing hundreds of papers. And the tenure process is taking forever along with a self study that i'm heading up in the department -- we're sorting data and developing coding processes...  (anyone *else* bored with that last paragraph?  how'd you like to live such administrivia?!  BUT YOU DO!?! that's the kicker -- if it isn't homework, its taxes or investments or gardening and 401Ks and church boards and the United Way...)  And so when Jaelyn says but what *is* the nothing? I want to tell her that its the colonization of institutions upon the freedom and happiness of our minds....  But I know that these very same institutions frame our lives and give us privilege (give *me* privilege) that we otherwise couldn't enjoy...  It's a beautiful saturday morning -- sunshine in the wake of the leftover hurricane storms we've been feeling.  And the resting makes me *see* the frenzy and the routine in a way that's not so benevolent.    I hope your Saturday morning gives you rest and peace and HOPE for the rest of the week -- because ultimately, I affirm that its not the presence of the institutions and their suckage that =s The Nothing --- it's the seeping & creeping away of HOPE in the bustle of trying to keep up with the great Sucking....and i hope that rest & hope leaves you feeling God's  peace~

        - bus rides -    when i was in the ninth grade, Calvary Baptist Church decided to run a bus service / ministry from Muskegon Michigan to Fruitport Michigan so that good Baptists of Muskegon could send their children to Faith Christian School, a ministry of Bethel Baptist Church and would not have to worry about the:   1.) multiple evils lurking in the local degenerate public school systems (not the least of which included: feminism, evolution, secularism, and pluralism)  2.) far more insidious danger(s) lurking inside the local West Michigan Christian School owned and operated by the Christian Reformed Church (who, notably, consumed alcohol, did not believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ and the ensuing seven year tribution, attended the movies, and even allowed Christians who believed in *evolution* to teach in their denominational colleges).    The teenagers riding this bus were so merciless and disorderly that each week a new bus driver was hired and then quit.  Occasionally the minister of visitation from Calvary Baptist Academy would be employed as a transitional driver.   Finally a little old man who was in his seventies was contracted to run the bus.  In the first few days he greeted each student with a smile and a kind hello.  Within a week, he stared straight ahead, brow furrowed as his little enemies filed onto the bus.    The elementary students sat in the front of the bus as far from the dangerous high schoolers as they possibly could.    I, having just moved to the area, and (for the most part) hating the high school already, found it neccessary to sit amongst the high schoolers so as to not engender any more alienation than I was already experiencing.   One girl, I'll change her name a little, Carrie, sat in the back.  Always.  She was the baddest of the bad.   On days when (I'll call him --) Bud would sit in the backseat with her -- her head would disappear into the hotly rumored realm of sexual favors or (which we, of course, did not call "sexual favors") the glassy straight - ahead intensity of both of their gazes would clue us into the fact that a "hand job" (as Max and his cohorts were keen to call them) was probably in session.  We knew we'd hear all the details the next day, anyway.  If "Bud" wasn't on the bus -- "Carrie" was doing one of two things:   a.) talking about the trouble she'd gotten in or caused or --  b.) causing trouble for the bus driver.    Occasional paperwads, regular commentary and one or two mooned cars on the highway were enough to drive the bus driving old guy to the edge.    Had it happened now, I would have been much more freaked.  After about a month (maybe it was more, I don't really have a chronometer that's very dependable in my memory banks), Old Guy pulled the bus to the side of the road, closed and locked the doors, stood up, and started to scream.   "You're all ungrateful!  I'm not doing it anymore!  Who was it?!  Who did it?!"  Only the wierd thing was that *this* time -- nobody had done anything.  The persecution had left some kind of mark in his consciousness like a glance at the sun will give you if you close your eyes right away.  He was feeling spitwads when there were none.  He was hearing nasty commentary when no one had given any.  He was seeing standing, moving students when none had.   He yelled for fifteen minutes then sat down and stared at the doors.  A third grader started to cry.    He turned to start driving again.   "Crazy old man!" yelled Carrie.   The brakes squealed.  He hadn't yet pulled all the way onto the road.  A passing motorist honked.  Swerved...    He looked with rage in the wide overhanging mirror.  The bus was silent for the next hour as the bus was gradually emptied of its riders.    The next day -- the visitation minister was back and we never saw the old man again.    Two years before, I would have complained to my parents that an authority figure had so misused us.  My sense of justice, injustice & the obligations of authority had always been very strong.   Several months at Faith Christian had destroyed my sense of justice in the world.  I knew that the Old Guy probably had it worse than we did.  I knew that I certainly felt like hijacking the high school several days a week.

      This weekend I attended Fresno Bible Church's Father-Son Banquet with my father in law.  Thursday night my mother in law called to let us know that the theme would be "Wear A Professional Sports Jersey to Prove What a Sports Fan You Are."  I don't think that the rest of the story even needs to be told -- does it?  Since I'm the author / teller of the story...I don't think it gets any better than that...

        - feeling good - but only for a moment -    just read over some blogs after getting an email from a friend who just read -- wondering what he encountered... and realized that i felt the same way this morning as I did on  urlLink July 23rd .  Anyone have a sign / astrology / a portent / anything that can explain this continuity.  What makes people feel good?   for me? this morning?  a great intimate / kind email from a good friend.  the crisp cold of autumn and the fierce blue of the sky.  class held downtown at  urlLink muggswigz.   But then I had to be an *advocate* for openness and dialogue in faculty senate.  I love the people in faculty senate -- but it, like any senate, reflects the complexity of living in institutions.  Not my favorite feature of human existence right now... (in case you *haven't* read any of the last hundred blogs! Thanks for the affirmation, Marcaus, on these feelings....it meant a lot to have a simpatico spirit so far away)  And now I don't feel the smile of the universe anymore.    Hopefully my kids -- who I'm about to spend an hour with -- will show me the joy of being alive....  Peace~  But

         - so much to write - so little time -    I've been thinking about:   our new house -- spent three hours there with a house inspector last night.  vocation - endless conversations with college students constantly destabilizes my sense of rootedness in my work. (ironic, eh?)  rootedness / commitment / community - the house inspector asked last night how long we would stay in the house.  Lynn and I looked at each other.  Vague, restrained panic registering on our faces. We can't answer *that* question.  *that's* the answer we don't give.  making choices = opportunity = eliminating other opportunities.  the weather is more beautiful than ever, but...  too many people are sick and depressed to number...  Being a Good Parent / Going To Work.  Greg and I had a bang up conversation about this topic a few weeks back.    Staying in the Moment / Owning the Now / Being Ambitious / Being Intentional.  Whose purpose?  Who's driving?  Who's life?    (no I haven't read it and I won't. Don't take it personally.  I haven't smoked a cigar or been to a Christian book store in five years either (when do you get your "second virginity" with Christian bookstores anyway?).  It's kind of like Jonathon M. in college who just decided that a certain sidewalk was sacred and didn't walk on it.  Ever. Until the day he graduated.  It was an awkward sidewalk too.  Sometimes you'd be walking in a group, and all of the sudden you'd go, Where's Jonathon?  And then you'd go.  Oh. The Sidewalk.)  Class in twenty minutes. Hmmm.  Should I prep more?  Should I keep writing...

      - feeling sentimental -  it hasn't been a great week.  you can probably guess when someone's back burner all but goes out that their arse is getting roasted by the front burner...  But right now I'm trying (on my front burner) to wade through my inbox full of emails...  And I'm struck by how lucky i am to know the people I do -- to have passed through the lives of so many of you, to be tangled in the nets and webs and fabrics of your lives even still...  It seems like too many people that I love (more than unusal) feel keenly the struggle of life right now.    Feel discouraged, feel disappointed, feel confused.   And I have to say that I, too, have felt a little of that recently...(is it the approach of Mars?)  But on the other hand, I do feel buoyed by the love.  The occasional, gentle, brief, quick --  *brushes*  *nudges*   *touches*  by you.  IN THE FORM OF: the quick emails.  the phone calls. the brief conversations.  the teasing.  the good joke in a website. the compliment. the shared beer or shared eucharist.  You know that moment in _A Room With a View_ where Julian Sands character runs into the field and embraces the world...just before he shares that scandalous and amazing kiss with Helena Bonham Carter's character (see * for sidenote below) ? -- that's how I feel right now -- even though my front burner sucks.  and the world does seem too much to bear.  It also feels like there's too much beauty in the world...   Is there a way that I can fwd. some of you some of my HOPE -- because I'm convinced that that's what it is...the reality that YOU exist in my world...gives me hope...  and...(of course)  peace~      *Lynn and I haven't forgiven Helena BC, the little hussy, for breaking up the greatest Shakespearean-cum-Hollywood couple ever -- Branaugh and Thompson....

       - social justice and everyday life -    i try not to shop at  urlLink walmart .  i believe, creedally, that walmart sucks.  i avoid the mall as often as possible. i don't like to eat at chain restaurants unless they're locally owned.   i never choose to go  urlLink mcdonalds  if they choice is completely mine.   but living out social justice is exhausting.  i'm never sure where i should draw the lines.  on the one hand, I want to patronize local business, because i'm investing directly in the lives of my immediate neighbors.  but on the other hand -- there's no sustained advantage in investing in my neighbors if they don't have the same commitments and ideals.  if they don't aim their dollars locally -- then i'm really just paying them to make a decision i disagree with.    OR what about good practice chains.  what if they pay fair wages, give good benefits and reinvest in the community more substantially than locals?    i just noticed that in the  urlLink Utne Reader  july-august issue there's a paragraph about somebody coming up with an idea for a  urlLink "procott"  movement -- the opposite of boycott -- whereby people strategically decide to consume in just / eco-friendly ways.   YEAH!  I'm all about it.  They suggest monthly meetings (don't have time), AND a web page (I have time!)  "Representatives from [different groups] might meet quarterly in a council and perhaps develop a list of local retailers and service providers that members could be encouraged to buy from."  YEAH! but then there's no more information.  This is something I care a lot about.  I think that faithfulness with consumption / investment  -- toward the ends of redemptive community / justice / shalom -- is one of the biggest blind spots of the church.  But I don't have the time to be faithful to my "front burners" and develop a real sustained lifestyle of shalom.  I should be able to do so in community...  so...this rant has been a long time coming.  it's a backburner topic that sometimes just itches the underside of my skin so hard that i....  well, in this case, i itched.  anyone want to join with me to create procott?  anyone know who's already doing it?

       - Beautiful moment –   I’m riding home in the car after an afternoon at the everetts – waiting for our “open house” to be over and having lunch and having fun together – and I glance at this late twenties guy driving in the lane next to me.   This guy has a buzzed haircut, leather jacket, crappy buick century from 8 years ago.   You know the type, right?  He’s probably listening to something hardcore, about to pull out a cig., disaffected and smarter than his station in his life betrays….  He’s got his armed sprawled over the top of the seat, probably to increase his feeling of angst and remove.  Until he pulls forward and he turns backwards to talk some nonsense to the toddler riding in the carseat behind him. His arm isn’t draped on the back of his seat, but is turned backward over the seat to hold the hand of this child in the back…  And I hadn’t been not liking him for all the stereotypical ways I interpreted his life, but suddenly I loved him for that gesture.   If you’ve done it – you know the painful joy of it – bending your shoulder backwards over a car seat is against the laws of nature (as is, probably, if you think about it, driving a car at all) but the joy of having a very little hand clutch your finger as if it were the only thing that could pull them through the rapidly passing future…  That’s a good thing.   It strikes me as a picture that gets at too much of how I think about my life as a parent right now.  I’m careening ahead toward LIFE (!) and all of its demands / opportunities – and I’m hauling my kids forward into my life as an invitation to them.  Come with me, be a part of the worlds I’m trying to build.  But so often the journey forward and the vehicle we’re taking make it too hard to make meaningful connection with them.  But when I do make that connection….well.  there aren’t many good words to describe the depth and profoundness of that feeling.   urlLink Marcaus’ words  about kids have been devastating prophecies that have been great words of truth (and pain) helping me see back into the core of what I hold true (connection / helping / holding / developing ) in the midst of the maelstrom which my life feels like right now. Thanks, man.  May moments of beauty interrupt your day today and leave you devastated and worshipping at the altars of hope and renewal and (always)  Peace~

      geez, that last post was a bummer.    but, of course, genuine. and that seems like a great goodness of blogging or any other kind of journaling -- leaving the rawness of down-ness out in public...  so today i've decided that while the arch-sin / root - sin / worst sin is still pride --   one of the most culturally pervasive expressions of it in the western evangelical world is --   forgetting to keep the SABBATH.   Rest.   i'm thinking today that the opposite of rest isn't motion -- its ambition.   And I need a break from my own crazy ambition.  i'm exhausting myself with the subtle inexplicit hubris of --  1.) saying yes to everything.  2.) trying to make the institutions i participate in... the best or better.   3.) doing my best at my work all the time (which inevitably means screwing up my best in other contexts)...  the lie of the public relations era -- and / or the bad version of the sophists -- and / or "quality stamped all over it."   is that whatever we do has to look like (/be) the best.   and that's not really seeming very core to the beattitudes or the fruits of the spirit or sacrifice or even plain old incarnation when i think about it...  but today's felt much better than yesterday -- i think b/c i'm resting -- worked out at the Y. Got a haircut.  went to the donut shop with the kids before jaelyn's school.  peace~

      i've been feeling unnerved about blogging about my faith journey because of the ads that keep popping up above.   i just want to clarify.  *i hate those things!*  so while i'm avoiding grading i ran into  urlLink a blog written by Douglas Rushkoff  -- if you know me, you've very likely heard me talk about him in the context of Generation X &  urlLink Merchants of Cool .  But his ideas -- particularly his big idea -- that we can take religion as an answer or as a question -- really resonated with me. (and it resonates because i like his answer -- that religion functions better as a question than as an answer.)  I percieve this to be  a parallel conversation with the whole  urlLink redemptive movement  thing that  urlLink Webb  articulates -- but in many ways I like Rushkoff's way of dealing with these questions better.   Webb, it seems to me, does a good job talking about some of the underlying issues in a way that committed modernists will *get* and enjoy -- but ultimately his method feels equally rigid to me.  and -- of course -- i think that webb completely gets the homosexual questions wrong --  i do, just in case you care, dislike how Rushkoff is always featuring the discontinuity (ultimately) with Judaism / Religion.  He uses the metaphor of dreaming and waking --   "It's time we wake up from the stories we've been telling ourselves and invent a new one."  and to me, these statement is fraught with a kind of platonic-cave-meets-the-manifest-destiny mythology.  and it misses all of the (much better) nuances implicit in the metaphor of "telling stories" -- specifically that stories are all rooted in structures, exploring and exploiting genres, reinforcing mythology...i could go on, but....  i really should ready myself for class...

      i haven't traditionally been all about posting links up here -- but i ran across this one this morning -- and it uses different language and theory than i'm used to, but it gets at a whole group of issues i've been thinking about -- and in a way that is appealing to me.    urlLink "policemen & shepherds"  deals with questions like "who is the church?" -- "who isn't the church?" -- and -- "what should the church's role in deciding who's in / who's out be?"  lynn and i are in a sunday school class going through the heidelberg  catechism and this week we did sacraments --   the whole idea that the church -- any church -- should be about policing the sacraments -- deciding who does and doesn't partake, who can and can't, who should and shouldn't -- in general, seems abhorent to me....  did you see  urlLink daniels' send up  of my most recent posting?  its funny.

       - last night's dream -   - subtitle: very wierd post -    I was dreaming in concepts.  I can’t really clearly describe what the concepts look like because it’s a little confusing – but if you can imagine that each argument was represented by movement to , into and away from embryonic / protozoic creatures roughly the size and shape of a fat round mushroom  head but fluidly moving like in the sea, only my movement wasn’t represented by an actual visual presence – more like a point of view.  The whole thing was mostly black and white – only not white – yellow.  So the concepts were the issues of – can a learning / teaching philosophy that is rooted in the students interest actually be a fruitful way to pursue extended learning.    (that’s my expressed belief before the dream, but in real life I’m constantly constrained by institutions and loyalties and (maybe more than all the rest) the sheer massness of the context I work in.)  During the dream, I’m watching these cell – type things float and hearing / having this conversation.   (I’ll characterize the two sides of the conversation roughly as id and ego – id being what I want teaching / learning to be – ego being what I’m told teaching must be given the way things are.)   ID: See so why couldn’t we, if a student wanted to, just look more and more carefully at those?  Or one of those? Or inside of one of those.   Close up on bouncing floating organisms, gently crashing together.  EGO: Becuase the more you indulge the student's self interest, the more self interested they become.   ID: (feels this more than says this -- it feels like a longing) but that isn't really true is it?  that's not a neccessary relationship.  EGO: Wouldn't it be better to teach them how the world IS?  ZOOM to WIDE ANGLE of millions of squirming bumping embryo movements.  Charts and graphs overlaid point out trends in their movement distinguish the different types of embryo-type things.  ID:  But just because we follow their interest doesn't mean that we have to become absorbed in the feelies or the bumblepuppies.  (seriously, i do remember using that Huxley term in my dream, in fact I even had some lucid dreaming awareness that such use of vocabulary was unnatural.)  EGO: But it makes it very likely. Watch.   And we ZOOM deep into one of the embryos. All motion stops.  We're left just staring at a textural surface.  EGO: See.  Just static.  No movement.  No learning.  When students are left to study their interest, they study themselves. They stare at their own belly buttons.  ID: But that's only because you stopped.  Just because you study self doesn't mean you stop and stare.  You can still find out more.   We ZOOM toward the texture.  The texture changes shape, admits of diverse shapes, and gradually gives way to more of the moving shapes.  EGO: But that's useless.  It's completely disconnected from any observable, external phenomena.  It's divorced from the ability to talk about anything shared.   ID: That's IT!  That's where you're wrong. Because we SEE it. or see them.  see these shapes, whatever they are -- they're not divorced from the world of talk.  They're represented.  As long as we have a study buddy that we can share our observations with and get feedback from -- we're still learning.  It's only when we can't represent our quest any more that we've become too inward.  (I did, seriously, use the term "study buddy" a term that I find both ridiculous and unusable in my waking life.)  The ego didn't respond, though and I felt the shapes and the movement disappearing.   I tried to reformulate what i had said, say it again.  But I couldn't.  I couldn't say anything or stop the images from fading.    I suppose, eventually, I woke up.    Unless I'm still dreaming.  In which case I'm definitely going to NOT grade my stack of papers.    OUCH.  Pinch test confirms awakeness.  I'm going to get some coffee.   It'll be a long week.  Though I won't be writing.  Thanks to all who have written.  I'm thinking of you.  Peace ~

      i've decided by thinking about it for a long time that --   CUSSING has a much different effect in PRINT than in TALK.   Even though the digital age renders communication so much more *ephemeral*  there's something about SAYING words in this medium that give them more WEIGHT.  Have you read the unbearable lightness of being?  It's one of my top ten novels.

      still thinking....  i talked about my  urlLink anti-quality-image rant  a couple posts ago to Greg & Lynn at Muggswigz the other night ...  i was saying that middle - low brow evangelicals got money in the last decade and started to get embarrassed about how lo-fi their gospel was -- so they started developing sheen for their gospel.  Started to think that gloss would be worth their while.  and i was ranting that that seemed so false -- that that image-conciousness seems in direct opposition to Jesus' tendency to minister to Samaritans, Lepers, Cripples & Children.  (Harry points out that in that culture -- children were a pure liability -- the likelihood is that they would die before adulthood but cost you lots in the meanwhile...hard for us to imagine given our child-centric culture.)  So Greg, sent an incisive challenge across the table...yeah, so, but you can't say the opposite is true can you? that the gospel is served by purposely NOT trying to present it with subtlety and clarity, style and beauty?   i'm always wondering whether or not this isn't one of those places where my values clash.  Sometimes Liberals value asceticism because of its connection to social justice -- if i sacrifice and live on less then someone else can live on more.   ascetics are not always the best of bed fellows with aesthetics.   And here's where liberals might frown at artists -- Judas protests to Jesus when the performance artist breaks open some lavish perfume and engages in a sensual inappropriate hair washing.    But its not the sensual norms that Judas protests – “we could feed a lot of poor with the money it cost for this!”  And that scowl has been retained in waves upon particularly the faces of protestant churches.    Lavish design and execution – art as worship has been rigorously lambasted as a violation of the Second Commandment – one of the great heresy of the Roman Catholic Church –  ….so here’s how that long debate rubs my question – the defenders of “quality stamped all over it…” might say something like quality construction / aesthetics has eluded Christians for so long – why shouldn’t we adopt the idiom so that we become relevant?  So my argument that there’s a value clash between social justice and presentational beauty puts me in the unfortunate position of Judas’scowl – MUST WE (!) be so lavish !?!? when the poor are going hungry?  A few readers may not be following so let me be more explicit – “quality stamped all over it” was a mantra chanted by leadership at Cedarville College, my alma mater when I was a student there.  Anything a Christian does – they suggested – should have quality stamped all over it.  This mantra was then used to explain to critics in their constituency the sometimes lavish choices they made in building their buildings, contracting IBM to hardwire their campus at the front end of the tech curve.  And while I was there I didn’t object to this ideology.    It’s only in retrospect that it smacks of external obsession, judging our faith based on the perceptions others develop about us (“how’s your ‘testimony’?”).  This burner is definitely still simmering…I’m having a hard time seeing through to the multiple issues at stake…

      i just realized what's been missing from this site thus far:   many of you already know it, but i have to say it in a public way (maybe even in a monthly way so that its on *each* of my blog pages):   i have a deep suspicion that drop - ceilings are to blame for everything.    1. whoever came up with the idea to make a space more -- whatever -- (intimate? cramped?) by eliminating our headspace -- well if i weren't a just-war pacifist (note my evolution), i'd say they should be shot.  2. i'm quite sure that there are multiple implicit effects stemming from this -- not the least of which is the stilting of the human imagination.

       Highlights from a good weekend:     1. slept in (til 8ish) on Saturday Morning.  (decadent)  2. worked out. got a haircut. as described below.  3. took the kids on a "date" to donut connection friday morning on the way to jaelyn's school.  4. ate sumptuously at Greg's generous hand.  5. nice conversation with adults -- Lynn, Greg, Marcia, Rhoda, Daniel, Mom & Dad --   6. got to cook.  7. took a late evening walk around our magical circle...  8. added  urlLink No Such Thing  (tentatively, but probably for the long haul) to my top five favorites movie list.  That list has a flexible membership which currently includes: Benny & Joon, Rushmore, Zero Effect, The Graduate, The Royal Tennenbaums,  and a sort of floating fifth place that looks like:   Mumford, The Good Girl, Chocolat, Donnie Darko, Harold & Maude, Before Sunrise, Unbreakable, Mr. Jealousy...  This isn't my list of THE BEST five movies, mind you, just my favorites.  They have complex and coherent enough narratives for me to not get "bumped" by them *&* they make me feel a certain way.  A good certain way.  Which I don't have a name for.  Happy Birthday, Marianne & Trena! (even though you don't know each other...)  peace~

       blog genres   i've been teaching a lot about genre this year -- my unit on genre in Persuasion has coincided or at least overlapped iwth my unit on genre in MASS MEDIA AND SOCIETY --   (hey!, my loyal readership insists, this is the *BACK* burner.  you can't talk about the content of your classes on here...yeah, yeah, i know, but...  i've been more and more interested in the diversity of emerging genres in the blogging universe.   Kelly blogs about  urlLink the RANT  not as a genre of blog discourse -- but of everyday discourse -- but i do think that ranting is a pretty normative genre in this medium.   the other genre i've been keenly interested in recently is the hello? genre.  My brother Daniel included this tag at the end of a recent post:   "BTW: It's really wierd to post ideas without having people read them. I'm always writing a letter or a newsletter page, or updating the web site, or participating in a forum, or sending out an e-mial to my church. In all of these situations lots of people read the stuff (or at least pretend to).   It's wierd, but I like it. Even the fact that I'm writing about my feelings on this has a stench of wierdness.   Ok.. It looks like for one paragraph there I entered into the world of blogging. Don't expect more of that.   (That last statement has the unwritten submect of "You"---Who is You??--That's what I mean about wierd?) "  Or my brother David, before he had Stanley, the fan, wrote:   "hey, if you are not my brother or in my youth group and you read this, would you mind emailing me at bishoprudd at yahoo.com?"  and after several days of nothing:   "by the way, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE???!!!??  oh yes, i know you're reading this. see that little black box to the left...no, higher up...no, the one with numbers...yeah, that one. that tells me how many people are hitting this site. and it doesn't count every time i come here! so WHO ARE YOU!!!  not that i care, as i've said before, i am here simply for you!"  in my first experiment with blogging, I wrote a  urlLink "who are you & what am i doing here?" entry , and Marcaus wrote me an email about it -- which i posted to the invisible (and pretty much nonexistent at that time) audience....  Yesterday I read a blog which qualified in the "hello?" genre, but seemed so lonely, and needy and pathetic, that I couldn't bring myself to post it publicly.   I wonder if all blogs go through a state of ambivalence about their identy / role / audience?   Maybe I'll start a blog that collects links to instances of the genre.   YEAH! That sounds like a great way to avoid this depressingly (s)tall(ed) stack of grading...  ***********************************************************************  well.  that's it.  its done.   urlLink Hello?    if you want to join the team of this blog -- (because you have so much spare time) -- let me know and I'll make you a team member.  Minimum membership fees?  find one instance of hello? blogging per month.  if you lag behind in your fees -- you'll be on probation for a minimum of six months.  then we'll have to see about what to do with you...  peace~

      good questions:   found these at the  urlLink lomohome of the day :   "1. What 3 meals from your past would you like to eat again (breakfast, lunch and dinner)?  2. What 2 objects would you like to own again?  3.What is the one act in your life you wish you could take back or erase?  4. What one person would you like to see again?  5. What one experience do you wish you could repeat?   * These are all taken from an utterly fantastic book called "White Apples" by Jonathan Carroll"

      jaelyn has strep throat --  i went to bed at 7 pm with some kind of monster headache --  lynn got very little sleep b/c i didn't / couldn't wake up with the kids --   i dreamed that four people called wanting to see our house.   in a separate and unrelated dream, I dreamed that i was *taking* a class with an odd conglomeration of faculty peers, high school friends, and church friends, and the teacher invited us to stand, turn in our hymnals and sing "victory in jesus" only when we stood up, everyone snickered and turned and looked at me.  There was an abominable smell, and everyone assumed that I had passed gas.  But I knew I hadn't so I didn't laugh.    And just then the room started getting woozy.  i started to lose conciousness (which is kind of wierd given that dream conciousness is a little different than waking conciousness -- isn't it?  maybe not inside the experience.).  So I ran / stumbled to the door for fresh air.    All around me, people were crashing to the ground, we were being poisoned.  I knew I should stop and help people, but I knew if I did, I wouldn't make it.  I could see the doors, but felt the pull of sleep heavily.  I made it only by throwing myself against the doors. Once they were opened the fresh air filled my lungs, I was immediately fine.   The dream continued, but I'll not.  I need to make some coffee.  Peace~

      went to the one act festival at malone several times this weekend.   took my dad once.    taking him made me realize how much I love my dad   *&*  how much i love so many students.   i felt a little bit of angst because i knew that the situation prohibited a really meaningful exchange where I could explain to him how much these students i was introducing him to matter to my life --   Toph, Amanda, Trena, Jared, Nathan, Brian, Kelly...  these people bring me so much joy, i wanted to tell him.  you'll never believe the promise they hold...the gifts that they have for the universe...the way the intersection of their life with mine brings laughter and frustration and hope and curiousity...  If I aspired to turn the world into slogans and theme weeks -- which i don't think i'd like to do, ultimately {readers breath a sigh of relief} -- then I'd call this "fabric of friendship week" --  it's one of those odd weeks that has a lot of birthdays in it.  SUNDAYS on both ends are Marcaus' birthday (yesterday) & Allen's birthday (coinciding with my debate trip to his home in Marietta, OH -- are you reading Allen?) and in the middle of the week is Gary (California-Gary, for those who know him thus...)  My mother taught us to celebrate birthdays vigorously in my family.  And so I'm thinking about these three men who have been deeply influential in forming me, in caring for me, in developing me.  And I'm feeling so rich. So fortunate.    Lynn just called me across campus and said:   Lynn: How are you?   Me: Good. I'm good.   Lynn: What!?  [I laugh]  Lynn: What happened? Are you drunk?  (the last two weeks have not lent many "goods' in response to that question -- I'm in the habit of being honest -- and honesty can only muster up a "okay." in general)  But I'm having all these epiphanies about calling and community -- which I long to blog about later -- but...  at the core, i have this abiding sense that even though my life is chaotic and less enjoyable than normal right now -- and there's too much to do -- and i'm disappointing more people than not --   I still feel keenly the WORTH and VALUE of life because I feel like my life has been stitched together with other lives that matter.  and its just as much the stitching as the cloth that matters.   Sheldon VanAuken wrote in a Severe Mercy -- that sometimes the beauty of the world was just too much.  That he couldn't take it. And I don't think I *got* that at all.  And even though I'm very moved by physical beauty -- in nature, in humans.  I'm so much more moved by the beauty of being with...

      ....  boring blogs  ....  i'm pretty sure that yesterday's public navel gazing blog qualifies as one such blog.   ready for me to go meta on that baby?  i perceive that on days when i feel overwhelmed by life and busyness etc.. (wednesdays it always reaches its peak/pique) NOT ONLY do I:   1. only feel and stop thinking,   but I also,   2. obsess over my own experience / feelings-about-the-experience,   and I also,   3. feel more need than ever for HUMAN CONTACT --   and the blog is an obvious opportunity to get some parasocial gratification.  And thus I conclude an even more solipsistic entry than the one before.    But I think its a little less boring?  Or is that just because public disclosure of feelings is boring?   And that, or course, public consideration of the implications and ramifications public disclosure of feelings is not at all boring....?  in any case, thursday has brought me much more --  peace~

      i think that i've realized that when i get really really busy (see last post), I don't really have anything simmering on the back burner -- I mean I don't forget all of the things that are or were there -- it's more like I just experience life as this huge undifferentiated mass.  I feel about everything, I think only about the one single thing that is on my exactly front burner.   One of my goals for this semester was to FEEL MORE, think less.  It's happening, but I think maybe I wanted to have kind of a think-about-feeling experience more than a straight feeling experience.   so how exactly am i to interpret Jewel's maxim, to "follow your heart, your intuition -- it will lead you in the right direction," on days like this when -- following my heart will lead me -- to bed. to go to sleep.  is that the right direction?

      what if time is actually going backwards and in the beginning were paper clips and engines and robots and we start our lives old and abandoned in urine-smelling nursing homes but we get to die as babies warm and snuggled by people halfway through their own lives...?  what if the robots and the paperclips figured out a way to make us think that we're experiencing it the other way -- and really our life fource is flowing not from the grass and the trees and the air and food, but from landfills and sewers trash cans full of used floss and discarded q-tips?   and their greatest invention is organic reality: trees and squirrels and sunsets and all?    and of course ultimately an even greater invention of theirs is stories and creation myths and God.  In any case, i don't think I'd do anything differently.    (not that I could if I would)  not drunk or stoned, just tired of grading -- i bid you --   ~peace.

      just before midnight on halloween night, i was walking across the parking lot in Marietta Ohio bringing two styrofoam cups of orange juice to Bemis & Scott Bell, noticing how the half moon had grown large and looked like an overripe precarious bit of orange fruit, about to fall off an overtaxed and invisible branch down toward the blue steel bridge which would definitely shatter into a hundred shards into the Ohio River.  Just then a very small, completely black kitten ran across the parking lot and the cement sidewalk.  There was no turning back.  If I were to go to my hotel room at all, ever that night, I would have to stay on the path which had now been crossed by a small black cat.    But what is the significance of a black Kitten crossing your path?  Certainly not seven years of bad luck? The very kittenness of the cat must either reverse the effects making it seven years of good luck or make the badluck stick for life.    Asian beetles are flying into my office window, but I'm not going to close it.  The day is just too beautiful and the mobile Greg Snell & Bev Matiko made for me is whirling in this delightful slow arc over my green metal 1960-something Steelcase desk.  It makes grading these persuasion papers a great deal more tolerable.    Have I ever mentioned on this blog that I hate grading?    That and drop ceilings.  ~Peace.

      ..................................................  Happy Birthday Grandma Marge  ..................................................  Depending on how you know me and what you know about me -- it's very likely that you'll know one of the following things:   1. I'm something of a social constructionist  2. I'm a bookworm  3. I'm a "theater person"  4. I'm a debater  But the center -- the core -- of what makes each of these things true about me is this:   I love stories.  And further:   I believe that stories make people.  I believe that story-ing is the fundamental human process.   And I have to pay a great debt of gratitude to my Grandma Marge for this value.   I'm pretty sure she wouldn't call herself a social constructionist, but she's been telling stories for the last thirty three years, and given her skill, she's been doing it a lot longer.  She grew up on a farm in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, her family having descended from William Brewster from the Mayflower and more recently from Kaiser Wilhelm.  Half the stories she knows (and that's a "half" based on the ethos of hyperbole) she learned by peering through the register in her bedroom floor and listening to the goings on below.    She had a lot of uncles who broke the heart of their mother and her mother alike, but the drama of their lives unfolding through the register made my grandma marge a keen observer of human nature and a natural relayer of human conflict, motivation and resolution.   I don't want to tell too many of her stories here, because she's still writing her own book of stories -- Through The Register.  She has an amazing authorial voice where she has an ability to condense a whole world of human action into a quick sentence.  Her stories are often told quickly, but there's always a hundred layers and nuances in each one.   But I do want to honor that its her birthday and i want to affirm that the stories she's passed on to me, feel as visceral and warm as the afghans, sweaters, & mittens she's made for me.  They feel like they constitute me.  And since this activity which combines: history and making and imagination and drama and performance and humor and tragedy -- is the one activity that i'm most devoted to in the world....  I wanted to tell you a little bit about her.  Peace~

      .......................................  a moment to celebrate  .......................................  one front burner successfully fried.  eight or nine to go.  this morning i turned in my tenure and promotion folder.  for those of you who know -- that thing has been consuming me for way too long.  for those of you who are interested (dad) -- an online version of most of it will be available soon. (i'll post a link for you here)  i get the enjoyable privilege of chillin with  my kids for the next two hours -- and we're looking forward to ex-roomates deke & kelly coming into visit with baby anna this weekend.   we've got a hopeful prospect checking out the house (we think? we hope?) on sunday...  for those of you who i owe an email or a call.  let me do what i'm best at right now -- apologize:   sorry.   the truth is that the front burners are still gonna be grilling for the next two weeks.  and the optimist in me says that after thanksgiving they'll be more manageable.    Realistically?  look for an email at Christmas Break.   Sorry to be so *absent* when the *presence* of your life & voice in my life is gives me life and energy...  happy birthday to butch!

      ....................  caution, strong language follows  ....................   urlLink Josh rants  about grading and in the midst of it asks me to say something in defense of grading...  ME!?!?  I'm genuinely sorry, Josh (seriously) that you are just one more victim of the evil (i'm not being ironic, i'm  urlLink ranting !) apparatus of bueracratic tool we call "grading."  Grading sucks....   School sucks....    I told a student today that I don't see my role in school as being participation in a "holy" institution.   Oh no.   take the corruption of the two party political system,   take the scavenging of Sam Walton,   take the slime of the advertising industry,  take the misogyny of Hollywood,   take the greed of Enron (and all like CEOs)  take the crusades of the church -- and NOW  you've got a more accurate view of my view of _SCHOOL._  Don't even get me started on GRADES!  Ideally, I see my role in school as being the minority dissenting vote, the prophet in his own city,   (and just so you know, I *know* that I don't live up to the beautiful martyrdom of these ideals)  BUT what is faith and truth and honesty if your front burner is school?   That grades *do* give us a chance to give our own subjective (yes, I agree, Josh, absolutely subjective) albeit, hopefully somewhat expert (and I use the term loosely) assessment of a particular performance in a particular place.   I always say --  Grades are not:   a measure of your learning. a measure of your personhood. a measure of your potential. a measure of your worth. a measure of your intelligence.   They just measure how well you stack up against a particular crowd -- in a particular place at a particular time -- given some particular opinions that have trained one particular person.   Are you hearing my particularity?   BTW, Josh, this is *so* not about your experience alone -- its about my front burner.  I feel keenly that I'm spending more time GRADING than doing the work that I came here to do...   urlLink Here's an article  that suggests that possibly (please!?) grades could go the way of the white tiger (something I know nothing about -- the white tiger that is) ( urlLink and BTW, Christian, YES, I would like such a feature  in my blogging software.)...and  urlLink here's a description of an alternate assessment system  that seems a heck of a lot better to me...  better for students, better for later evaluaters, and (though harder) better too for teachers -- it would allow teachers to be more devoted to the process of contextualizing a student as opposed to treating them as they so often get treated...  ~peace

      ..........     .........   ....  good weekend  ..........     .........   ....   Convinced myself to honor the sabbath out of a little bit of piety and a lot of exhaustion.  Slept 9 hours Friday night. (that hasn't happened in several months)  Had a great time watching and discussing  urlLink Bend it like Beckham  with Lynn Friday evening -- and we watched it again with the kids.    It's a perfect movie -- in that -- it works really well on this purely formulaic, popular, narrative level.   Indian girl tries to break from her parents expectations into a life full of futbol.  Makes a friend, alienates community, falls in love with coach in the process and...  i won't include a spoiler on the ending...  but its perfect, too, because it also works as this really nuanced commentary on the clash between post-colonial cultural theory and western liberal feminist theory.   I mean Really Really Well.   And its so ripe with the images of globalization that it makes your head spin....professional sports, airplanes everywhere, the ephemeral presence of Beckham and posh spice, america as the "promised land", white "liberal" suburban moms who think that having "a curry" for lunch = a cultural experience...  And then the next evening we watched  urlLink Whale Rider  (i know, i know, we're behind the times, but we live in mideast ohio and babysitting is too expensive).  And I was struck by the fact that in some ways its a very different answer to the same question...  Don't read on if you don't want a little bit of spoiling for BILB...  B/c Whale Rider asks the same question:  How does a woman find her way in a culture that doesn't have room for her?  How can any one person-on-the-margins balance fealty to their traditions *&* be everything that they are capable of?  But in this film -- instead of articulating the self over and against the culture -- the answer is to give all the strength that you have TO the culture -- but on your terms...  it seams together feminism and indigenous/traditional life in a much more harmonious relationship...  the role of cultural performance in BOTH is devastatingly central...can you see why i'm so obsessed with Garage sales & Tractor Pulls & Pageants & Preacher Boy Contests now?

      sometimes when there were three different families in the house, in the one house, too small, awkwardly furnished, cramped floor plan house, she felt as if her head were electric.   There would be moments where no one was in the kitchen.  She would stand against the table, not leaning, but pressing the tops of her thighs against the curved wooden table edge.  She would stand there poised and tense, waiting for the running footsteps of toddlers to come thumping back down the steps, the curious bewildered overweight and unshowered woman in the back room to come lurching down the hall, the starry eyed young couple -- (could they even be twenty?) to emerge from the basement (are they kissing down there? groping one another feeling eager and anxious and daring?). As she waited her head felt electric with plans and possibilities.    Could she keep them from following one another into a room? Down a hallway? Could she avert their gaze from the moldy trim on the floorboard across the room? She struggled to make herself guard her eyes from the greenish blackish blotches?  Who were these owners?  How could they miss that mold?  If she stood with her shoulder leaned forward to the frump, could she discourage her from staying, could she shoo her out?  Could she creak her foot on the basement step and make the newlyweds flee in embarassment?   But whenever she started to think in these maths, she knew she couldn't count on her intuition.  The young family with the toddlers seemed the most right for this house, but so far, two years in, she was finding that houses rarely fit people in the ways that she thought that they should.    In fact, she knew almost instantly when she saw a house the kind of owner or family or inhabitant that would fit that house best.  Sometimes she needed to stand in the middle of the living room before the picture developed in her head -- who they were, how they would use this space.    But the other sundays had convinced her that this gift, this knack that had just maybe been responsible for landing her in this particular life, was maleformed.  Families most often did not fit the houses they bought and houses did most often not fit their families.  On days when lunch was sitting well and her hair did not feel too unruly and she had managed to have just exactly the right amount of coffee (3.5 cups, she knew it, but when she drank with clients or in a conversation, she just couldn't monitor it, so more often than not she ended up with a headache or feeling down), on those days, she knew that her gift was right, but people made bad decisions regarding houses because it was a practical decision.  People employed criteria that were entirely heartless.  And all she could see with was her heart.  For her, houses and inhabitants should be love matches.   Yes, the other sundays, most sundays she spent the duration of the long afternoons all alone in the houses.  She tried to take interest in the family photos, but she found them so depressing.  All these children in the exactly same poses and clothing that Walmart had sold to every other mother in every other house that she waited in.  She tried to take interest in the needlepoint by some or another great aunt, and then the similarities were even more frightening.  Certainly everyone's rural aunts weren't swapping their patterns at walmart, but the doilies and quilts and the chintzy towels felt as continuous as the false windowpanes on the pulldown backdrops behind the pained smiles of a hundred coaxed and prodded children on a hundred walls hanging just above a hundred sofas that had gone out of style in New York three years before they had ever arrived in the show rooms here in the midwest.  During these sundays she became convinced that they filled their houses with these identical photos, these mass-marketed sofas, these carefully selected heirlooms, these silk flower arrangements, these collectibles and this high tech electronics equipment all as a strategy for survival.  There had been some moment when they had recognized that this was not the house for them. (She could have told them before they ever had the house inspector come to look for traces of mice and termites that their search was misdirected.)  In a panic, a concerted and controlled frenzy, they had erected these shrines.  These objects when placed carefully in relationship to one another acted as shrines marking a kind of holy space that could transcend any house.  The house didn't need to matter at all. So it didn't make then happy in the way they imagined it would or in the way they hoped it might.  These oak dining room chairs, these carefully matched craftsman endtables, these Thomas Kincaide prints *could* reassure them that they were indeed living as well as they might.   If only the yellow pages had a section for House Purchasing Shaman.  She really had no interest in being a "Realty Agent."  She wanted to be a Home Selection Shaman.  She could be cross referenced with Termite Inspections and Kitchen and Bathroom Contractors.  The toddlers feet started thumping on the stairs.   She stood up.  She realized she had been sitting, not just leaning, not really poised anymore.  And the energy that had been buzzing in her head faded across the memory of a hundred sundays before and a hundred sundays to come in silent unsellable, but ultimately sold houses.   She moved to the far corner of the living room.  If she stood there in the corner with a broad smile (not too intrusive, not too warm) and an arm vaguely lifted toward the kitchen, she just knew they would move that direction.  And that movement would startle the passionate duo below and possibly they would all cross paths right here in front of her.  And the frump would misread the sign of her slightly uplifted arm to be a signal to her, and when she would look below her arm, she would see the grate on the fireplace and realize that it reminded her exactly of the grate over her own fireplace in her own childhood home and thirty days later, she would sit across the table from the frump, smiling (not at all intrusive, not at all warm, just trying not to be plastic), as she sorted through a stack of signing papers.    Oh this was the house for her, she could just hear the frump saying, and the parents of the toddlers, whose financing had not come through yet, would be meeting at the door of their apartment, he coming in, she exiting, shouting instructions about dinner in the oven and he must, he absolutely must have a bath tonight, and if we had a bathtub sometime in the next year, wouldn't that be a miracle.    The toddler jumped onto the landing from the stairs and stared into her eyes. He looked at her raised arm, widened his eyes, and pointed in the same direction.  Happy.  Mom! Dad! He called. Their feet on the stairs, and he obediently runs toward the kitchen.

      ...................................................................................  sparkling clean septic systems and airline culture  ...................................................................................  6:37 a.m. -- i hear addison coughing upstairs, its a bit of a gagging cough and i'm a pretty over-protective parent when it comes to sickness...  i arrive to find him throwing up on every piece of bed linen, pjs, pacifier, you name it.   i rush him to the toilet so he can hold his head in it (which he clearly enjoys) and not throw up anymore.   i briefly remember the scene from trainspotting.  i think about how much more alluring, clean and sparkly our bathroom, toilet, and possibly even septic system is than that one was.    I wipe him clean, make him a sicky bed on the couch downstairs.  (one of my favorite memories from being childhood was sickbeds on the sofas.)  (parenthetically to that parenthetically, one of my favorite traits about my grandma linda was that she always refered to couches as "sofas" or "davenports" -- never couches.  i subsequently always presumed that the word: couch was a bit lowbrow.  my grandma linda was a pretty class act.  more on that later.)  9:00 a.m. -- the babysitting coop is scheduled to arrive -- no word yet on whether sickness will postpone their arrival.   11:30 a.m. -- jaelyn's preschool is having a thanksgiving feast for which she volunteered us to bring hotdogs.  every four year old got to volunteer their specialty food.  so the menu includes popcorn, hotdogs, white cake & (i pity the four year old's parents who volunteered on this one --) turkey.  3 p.m. -- i leave for 5 days in miami.   that's right i'm leaving my wife with a sick two year old and a precocious 4 year old for five days.   i don't feel good about that.  but i do relish the chance to be in liminal spaces all days -- airports / airplanes -- alone.    finding space to be alone is so difficult during this season of life...there's something so freeing in the massness, the globalizingness, the strangerhood of airline travel...its a world (at least here in the "developed" world) that is so antiseptic...  i don't embrace those values, but i have to admit that they provide me a place for solace.   peace~

      ...........................  monastic church  ...........................  as many of you know i've been following the * urlLink emergent church * movement in various online venues for a bit now -- i'm intrigued and more than a little excited by the movement ....  (though i do, of course, have reservations, hesitations and questions)  but the idea of a  urlLink monastic model  as being complementary to an ecclesiastic model is pretty exciting to me.   exciting why?    well:   A.) it's sorta more compatible with the way i want to be invested in higher education (particularly, in my case, "christian" higher education...)  B.) its pretty descriptive of the ways in which i have most profoundly experienced church -- particularly if you think of these monastic models as  urlLink cells  -- in the ways that my friend  urlLink kevin rains  writes about.  (I do understand that I'm taking liberties with the concept of monastic living here -- by stretching it to include communal living...but using the notions of  urlLink residual and emergent ...it seems like its  urlLink the vows  and the depth and the size and the intention that is the resource-giving residue and the  urlLink small-pieces - urlLink loosely-joined -structure that gives us the grammar to imagine new incarnations of these  profound truths...)  C.) it seems a better way to address some of the  urlLink pressing questions around how the church handles vocation  which i was blogging about so much this summer -- and am always thinking about a great deal...  oh and BTW, Daniel,  urlLink this bit of reading , i think, defines your ideas for your house of preparation beautifully.   man, i gotta get back to grading!  leaving for miami in 27 hours...  peace~

      ................................  10 things i'm "into"  ................................  1. IM - ing with my brother David - there's something about the discourse of fragmentation and commentary that delights me.  2. Lynn's style - my wife has become so daring and expressive and bold both in her personal "look" (which is hot) and in her thinking about her profession and vocation (which is deep).  3. family dance nite - we light candles and writhe -- these days to the Flaming Lips (Jaelyn has a longterm, ongoing thing for the character and song -- Yoshimi) and Rufus Wainwright (i must also allude to the eargasm that song #3 from this new album - WANT - gives me when i listen using earphones. i'm pretty sure it would have a similar effect upon anyone even slightly open to the world of suprising sensual delight).  4. emails from old friends - I need old friends.  The day to day social fabric of my life feels precarious and threadbare -- in general premised upon too many "professional" relationships.  5. boundary breaking - a few "professional relationships" -- students and peers -- who are shockingly honest and regularly kind  6. cottage cheese - i don't know why, i just love it right now.  7. phone conversations with daniel - we've been concocting more than our average share of thinking / heresy lately.  8. grey skies and a midwestern chill in the air - i'm a northern boy, what can i say?  9. impending thanksgiving - traditionally Rudd thanksgiving is our favorite holiday of the lot.  can't wait. (i'm particularly eager to see Ang & Ryan's new house -- which will be -- I'm sure -- *very* goth.)  10. hair wax - i can't believe how much difference it makes in the day to day grind.  * not neccessarily in order. except for the last one.  b/c that's a little bit tongue in cheek.  ** as for the title: my friend Greg used to regularly be "into" new things -- he's an early adopter of, i think, all important trends.  this *is*, if you're wondering, Greg, the co-founder of the Sensualist Society (of which I am the other co-founder).  and the Greg who fantasizes about taking a nap in a pile of freshly laundered clothing while flying in an airplane. But *not* the Greg who quoth _The Raven_ in a mask and cape on a public stairway in Florence, Italy.  That's another Greg who is also often "into" very interesting and exotic things.  Right now he's literally "into" Korea -- where he teaches and has astonishing adventures.  He *is* the Greg who made the mobile whirling over my desk...  ***what if i die on the plane en route to miami and this is my last blog?  aren't our lives trivial?!  aren't our joys mundane?!  peace~

      ...............  dreams  ................  this weekend i dreamed that i had made a creamy plum and pomengranate sauce to be served with grilled salmon.   it was amazing.   i've never made a sauce for salmon, nor have i ever made a creamy sauce that included plum or pomengranate.  lynn dreamed that i broke up with her to go out with johanna.  jaelyn never reports her dreams, and the ones she does, i know she makes up because they're too much like the story structure she uses when she tells normal everyday stories.   this morning, though, she promised rather cryptically, that she would reveal her dream from last night at supper.   we sort of ate in shifts around the counter and there was never any "formal" family conversation. now she's asleep.  Drat!  I'm intrigued by the world of children's dreams.

      well faithful readership,   by this time, you've probably become less faithful.  as well you should.  has it been six days? seven?   my wife celebrated thanksgiving with her family while i was in miami --  her cousin shea says she was victim of blog-attrition here at the back burner.  she was originally in our demographic but stopped reading because we (that's the authorial, royal, editorial and formal "we" which really means "me, but please, listen to me, i'm writing in a conventional way!") were too hard to understand.  i'm going to have to reread the blog.  sorry readers if i've been offputting.  MIAMI was fabulous in the following ways:   1. met some great people -- mostly job applicants -- but that's front burner talk...  2. enjoyed my colleagues marcia & ann.  they're fun, deep, engaging -- how lucky to work with the kind of people that you enjoy playing with (i know we're dangerously close to talking front burner again)  3. catching up with d.dra & mary -- sangria, moros, plantain and throngs of miami hipsters swarming around us in an outdoor lincoln street cafe -- hilarious conversation and intense conversation -- all in the span of a few hours? lucky me. good times.  4. beaching / snorkling with thomas -- saw a few fish, but enjoyed the downtime immensely.   what feels pressing about the world right now?    i feel burdened that people fear taking their lives seriously.    they fear that when we seriously contemplate the meaning making that we're doing -- we'll find ourselves lacking.    they fear that they can't meet the BIG (particularly mediated-mythologized) criteria that are cultural commonplaces for evaluating meaningful lives.    they fear that thinking too hard about such things makes them more serious than fun.    they fear that too much consideration about these questions will erode the simplicity of their quotidian & mundane everyday lives.   and when I say "they" i mean "we."   is such inquiry more the domain of the privileged classes?  doesn't everyone want to make meaning in the world?    i'm really asking...b/c i think i could make an argument either way.   is it (such inquiry) solipsism?  (the key theme for my miami trip)  promised my brother that i'd have only a ten minute blog so he could call his assistant. i'm one minute over.  peace~

      ...............................................  nametags & academic culture  ...............................................  miami was, in case i haven't been clear, an academic conference.   several thousand Communication PhDs, grad students, teachers & scholars overtake a hotel and conspicuously consume and produce their collective disciplinary values.    textbook fairs are huge affairs with cake and champaign.  big wine and cheese parties distinguish big schools from unimportant schools and people schmooze in desperate attempts to kick start their careers, stay relevant, or stay alive in the flow of the measured successes they've found.   But in all of it -- one artifact really intrigued me this year -- nametags.   we all wore them on our chests.  and my friend thomas quickly noted the horrific practice of the nametag glance-and-dismiss.   the thing about the nametags this year was (other years too?) that the FIRST NAMES were big.  really big.  all caps and probably a fifty plus font size. Last names and affiliate institutions?  20 font.  and small.   So that in order to see WHO a person is -- who they REALLY are (eg. what their last name is because that's what they publish with   or   where they teach because that's what designates how important they are on the academic food chain) you have to glance.  The first name?  no glance needed.  its the first thing you see.   So the glance-and-dismiss is this sort of I'm-schmoozing-my-way-upward-in-this-world gesture that performs a persons social location in a really eloquent and (in my mind, for them) embarrassing way.  i talked about a performance piece that i was considering doing next year at the convention where i would modify my institutionally issued nametag after registry to read   ANDREW  rudd but does it really matter? I haven't published since grad school.  or   ANDREW  no last name and youve never heard of my community college    alas, i don't think i'll get to because there's suddenly an outcry on the disciplinary listserve where the upwardly mobile, status-seekers are complaining.  how do we find out who legitimates us?  who makes us real?  important?  who's worth talking to?    have you read  You Are Special ? the childrens book about the wemmicks and the stars and the dots?  That's a great example of the nametag-glance. (i'll not mention the name of the author, in fear that he may pop up on my blogger banner above -- and in general, i'm as peeved as i can be that he and the greedy-hungry christianbookstoreindustry have sold this nice story up the river for a franchise opportunity......brands, brands, everywhere...)  i thought about posting a response on the listserve -- but really, what's the point? there's no way for the posters to save face.  i'd be proclaiming the emporer to have no clothes on -- and they'd all feel naked for a year.  But a year of nakedness might redeem them....  so i rant here instead.    its a strange world when a university is a brand name and a last name is a franchise...

      ..................................  paper lantern icons  ..................................  while i was in miami i bought paper lanterns for the kids that had an indian looking design on them (a little bit like  urlLink these ones ).  last night we finally bought some cords and colored low wattage light bulbs and hung them in their rooms.   their response was unwarranted.  crazy.   jaelyn was (literally) jumping up and down running back and forth across the hall jabbering non stop.  addison was two steps behind and two (half-articulated) sentences behind.   stuff like:   "I love my new lamp."  and  "That's so cool, Daddy."  and  "lamp, lamp, lamp, lamp. pink lamp."  and then out of the blue, right in the middle of all the running and hopping and smiling and laughing, jaelyn shouts, literally,   "hosanna!"  wow.  lynn and i just looked at each other.  i think we were both filled with ambivalence in this moment.    there's a part of me that always feels wierded out when people start using church-code-talk.  even in church. calling each other "brother" and "sister" and "blessings" and "greetings" and when they start to feel sick about a decision or inconvenience -- changing course midstream because -- they "didn't have a peace."  how do you have a peace? just one.  but then there's this other part of me -- the part of me that's trying to parent by surrounding my kids in the stories of the Bible -- instead of in the decadence of church-bubble-culture -- that goes: wow.  jaelyn just reached deep for a better, bigger expression of joy, and came out with a storied truth -- possibly ritualized for her in the three year old class in the basement of our little church -- but ultimately, she found that story meaningful.  i love that.  i know people who would correct their children, no, honey, JESUS is who we shout Hosanna to.  only him.    but i'm glad that jaelyn shouts hosanna when she feels deep joy, because ultimately, the connection will come.  deep joy springs from great longing and long waiting and surprising magnificence.  that seems like a good incarnation for the Divine for her for right now.    BTW ~ Lynn, if you're reading, I just realized where ELSE "hosanna" has been ritualized for her, but that only ratchets up my ambivalence by about twenty-eight (exactly twenty-eight).  so i'll save that story for another blog.  peace~   urlLink

      ..............................  urlLink [grid::brand]   .............................  a long time ago i  urlLink wrote that  objects which define us actually signify multiple possibilities.   Any object that a person possesses points both ways -- the hopes she has and the fears he hides.  I'm trying to say that there's a certain precariousness to all of our objects.  They show us for what we are and for what we want to be and aren't and for what we don't want to be, but may be becoming.  I'm wearing a typical Rudd costume today.   a pinstriped wool suit jacket, a floppy collared dress shirt, jeans with a hole in the knee and bowling shoes.  I'm fond of *bragging* that i buy all of my clothes at thrift stores and today its mostly true, but lately I've been noticing the fact that these shirts have tags in them. These coats do too, and every once in a while they’ll catch my eye…and I’ll be struck by how the brands have decayed – and also, often, at how local the brands seem.   There’s a mysteriously intertwined embroidered DJ (or JD) on the tag of this coat.  Along with a place – Muskegon Michigan.  On the shirt tag (SEARS) is the detail that its woven synthcotton – a brand in the making?  Above the tag someone has written in a black magic marker KRSKA – handwriting, all caps, a brand.  The standard line for me is that I love to wear these second hand clothes because I feel like I am wearing history.  That somewhere in Muskegon Michigan maybe fifty years ago, there was a tailor with a shop called DJ (or JD) who made carefully crafted wool suits.  And then when his drinking problem kicked in he lost thousands in a gambling incident and the shop went bankrupt.  Or he worked until he was seventy five and most of his customer base had passed on until Someone Van Something called his daughter to let her know about how much his arthritis pained him as he stitched up a hem, and he went to live with her for four years, watching birds meticulously out her dining room bay window.  But I have to be honest.  My jeans have a Diesel brand on them.   And I know that that’s very corporate and a big sell out, but does it help that I got it at a regionally owned discount store?    At least I’m thrifty.  And devoted to local economies.    But the workers there, given the strained look on their faces don’t look as if they have benefits included in their jobs. They don’t look like they even get enough breaks.    So should I feel bad that I bought these Sketcher shoes I’m wearing at that same store?  Because they don’t LOOK like sketchers – at least not the way that sketchers looked when I decided not to buy them because they were (used to be) too young, hip, and skateboardy (not that there’s anything wrong with that) – they look like bowling shoes.  And I’ve always wanted bowling shoes – just like I always wanted a briefcase that was actually a doctors medical house call bag.   I want artifacts that tie me rhetorically backward in time to an era before a brand = a lifestyle = a class status = a set of associational cues as to my other probably psychographic predictors…  But my Hanes boxer briefs are proof positive that I live now.  In a brand new age.  And that longing for history is the longing of the dispossessed or at least the overly disaffected.   My teaching assistant Andrew Berg wears mostly thrift store t-shirts.  Track team t-shirts from cities he’s never visited etc.  Everyone who sees him wearing these t-shirts “gets it.”  Well, I should say, everyone who should get it – gets it.   I shopped with Ryan my brother in law and Ang my sister this weekend and I was lucky enough to buy an Awana Club Leader shirt (just wait til you see the patches I’m adding…) and a Referee shirt.  These shirts clearly can be worn with irony.  On the other hand, Ryan and I got stuck in the quagmires of whether enough decay time had passed with an environmentalist shirt that he found.   It was all Love The Earth, Do Good to The Trees.   Stuff that Ryan, Ang & I agree with.    So on the one hand you don’t want to buy that at a thrifts store, because then people will think that you’re being ironic and that you don’t love the earth or do good to trees.  Or maybe they’d think that you just owned that t-shirt.  Especially if it was oversize. (since that’s the best clue that you’re wearing thrift store t-shirts—that they’re too small).  But that’d be embarrassing, because then you’d be being too earnest.   OR maybe enough decay has set in that the really hip reader would get it that you were being ironic about the irony of wearing thrift store t-shirts and “get it” twice over.   But it’s too precarious.  Too much risk.  He didn’t buy it.    urlLink Andrew Jones  wants to be remembered as a naked man in the tub not a branded man in Hugo Boss.   And I have to admit that the idea is appealing to me – brandless, historyless, unfettered, nondenominational, uninstitutionalized – but I feel like a better more honest picture of me is in a bathtub collaged so full of tags that I can’t move at all.  I’m not sure if I’m naked or not, because I’m so awash in the influences, in the promises, in the premises of my  urlLink Awana Club  shirt, my old Independent  urlLink Fundamentalist Preacher Boy Trophies , the  urlLink General Association of Baptist Churches ,  urlLink Cedarville College , The Young Republicans,  urlLink Andrews University , the  urlLink National Communication Association ,  urlLink Bowling Green State University ,  urlLink Covenant Church of Bowling Green ,  urlLink The Democratic National Party , the  urlLink Utne Reader ,  urlLink Amnesty International ….  Aren’t brands just agreements that we believe in the same things?  Don’t you think so, DJ?  (Or was that JD?)

      .............................. Addison's Birthday ..............................   urlLink     this morning jaelyn, lynn & i surrounded addison's bed and woke him up singing happy birthday.    we got through the whole song twice -- inches from his face -- and he was still laying there, hands folded neatly behind his head theoretically sound asleep.    at the end of chorus two, lynn said, "who's going to open one of his presents first thing this morning?"  no twitching or changing in the sleeping face, but his hand quickly thumped his own chest.  Birthday song?  ho-hum. Birthday presents? Well that's a whole different proposition.  the picture above is from LAST year's celebration -- the waalkes kids, jae, & leah surround the birthday hero.  below is a more recent photo (in action this summer).  though most birthday celebrations will be postponed til next week (because of jaelyn's severe strep -- and probable infectiousness of all of us), we're still celebrating Add's entry into our world!

      .......... limin ..........  my friend / student ryan writes about liminality and limin (one of my favorite topics) and asks in  urlLink today's blog , whether:     Does everyone always feel they are at an in-between stage?   Neither here nor there? I guess people my age do at least.  Isn’t life just one big state of limin anyways?    I have this idea that people RESIST the feeling of betweenness because its unsettling.   That most of people's fealty to doctrine, institutions, bueracracy, parties, stereotypes & locales is rooted in a growing or lurking sense of fear that...  THINGS ARE CHANGING.  and they may or may not be able to keep up or MATTER in the world-that's-coming.  I think there's a certain truth in being able to embrace the danger and chaos of betweeness that's rare to find in people.  Particularly in people who have the opportunity to opt out of that danger -- that betweeness -- that neither/nor -- both/and....  how dare i go up for tenure in the face of these comments?    how dare i own a mortgage?   and why buy life insurance at all?    good questions.  i keep asking them too.  i'll tell you this, it's a heck of alot easier to be a prophet when your retirement account is steadily growing than it was to be naked and wandering through the streets of jerusalem with an oxen yoke on your back.  unsettled in my peace ~

      ...................  ...................  i've been trying to be attuned to  waiting  -- in order to be fully present in the advent season.   as soon as i started to try to attend to the times that i had to wait, i realized something about my life:  its very religious.   somehow or another, the guy (me) who labelled watches "institutional handcuffs" and stubbornly refused to believe in time -- lives in a world where his life is so carefully organized that not only does he always know what to expect next.   But he also always seems to be able to orchestrate that next whatever right now.   i'm not sure what's wrong with that yet, but I'm sure that something is.   so we were putting up the christmas tree last night and we have this family tradition that on the night we put up our christmas tree -- we order pizza.  so we did.    i happened to glance out the window and noticed that the pizza delivery minivan (go figure!) was parked on everhard road -- the road in front of our house.  Those of you who have visited know that NO ONE parks on the side of everhard.  There's no place to park, but there he was, turning on his hazards, traffic backing up behind him before he could even open the door.     Apparently he had second thoughts, because his hazards went off, the car edged forward.  And he disappeared.    But I had been waiting for him at the door.  I was eager to receive the pizza, hand him the check and let him run back out to his car before he caused a major pileup in front of our house.  But what happened now?  Had he pulled just a little bit forward?  Should I stay?  Wait?  I paced from window to window for more than ten minutes.  Ten minutes, when you're convinced that something is IMMINENT, is a long time.  I walked into the living room and watched Lynn pulling out boxes of ornaments, listened to J & A make up elaborate stories between nativity characters involved in some custody battle (seriously.  that was the jist of their playful invention).   I should help Lynn.  I should set the table with paperware.   I should wait by the door, just in case he comes zipping up.  I should...  Where is he!?  And I realize that I'm waiting.  So I look around inside my interior world to see what waiting is like.  It's like: annoyance.  It's like: eagerness.  It's like: imbalance, the moment just before a forward fall, but after you've committed too far to the lean...only oddly enough, it feels like you're stuck in that precarious, uncontrollable not this/not that.  Almost/Not Quite.  Waiting doesn't feel mostly hopeful (even though I am -- Pizza as Messiah seems a potent metaphor at the moment).  Waiting doesn't feel spiritual or good.  It feels like C'Mon Already.  Addison these days asks about what's going to happen next all the time.  He wants to know "How we get home?" "How we get there?"' "How you coming back?"  "How I get that thing?" etc....  So I try to be honest and forthright as I leave and I give him an answer in terms of hours or occasionally days.  His answer is so standard, that I can say it along with him.   "No. No. TWO minutes. You be back in TWO minutes."   And now Lynn and I are resigned -- we say,  you're right -- in Addison time, we will be back in two minutes.    But two mintes.  You can't get anything done that fast (I feel like telling him).  But on the other hand -- he can't imagine a world that's much bigger than the emotional terrain of exactly two minutes.    where did he learn that anyway?    so i'm trying to decide how to end this....  i'm still thinking...  hmmm...  maybe I'll...   urlLink

      ....... Ugh. .......  I've got the crud J & A had earlier this week.  I feel terrible. No post today.  And apologies for the mother-of-all-posts-length on that last one.    I still don't have my email or my address book, so if I owe you an email -- give me another day or so of grace!  peace~

      ..................................................... interpretation, inference & expression .....................................................  i live in an old house.  its a good house.  i love the house, but it *acts* like an old house.   if you put a marble down on any wooden floor, it rolls.  certain steps creak and in the morning, you have to step past the bathroom sink, because there's a squeak in the floor that could wake up a light sleeper right in front of the sink.   But I really love our house. Especially in the winter; it feels like an extension of my body -- bringing me warmth and shelter...  Sometimes, when Jaelyn or Addison jumps off the bed upstairs and the walls and the ceiling resonate with this big boom, I feel like -- wow.  this house has survived a lot of jumping bumping jarring etc... (built in 1923...) And sometimes I think: does there come a point where an old house reaches that point where things just start to slip apart instead of settle together?   And these questions feel directly related to this other thing i've been thinking about.  ...  i was surfing blogs the other day and i ran into a:    urlLink post    that fascinated me...  i read this blog occassionally.  i happened upon it because its title -- rear view window seemed like an allusion to my main man:   urlLink Marshall McLuhan    & because its writers *seem to* share my last name (not sure of that), and because they're writing about social justice issues from a sort of post-evangelical perspective...  but this was the bit that fascinated me.     While surfing the nets this morning i realized than many bloggers (namely i-want-to-be-cool-and-emerging-altenative-christian bloggers) have several links to other i-want-to-be-cool-and-emerging-altenative-christian bloggers that they have never met or had any kind of ongoing conversation with. "Who's got the biggest penis" has become "who's got the most cool personalities on their blogroll".  [please note: i am in no way trying to offend anyone here]  Over the last year our blogroll has grown (with more to add). But these are people we actually know -- in person ... face to face. Hell, some of them are cool. Many of them aren't (once again, no offense intended). There are two exceptions of people we haven't actually met, to which i now feel i should remove from our list for consistency's sake (we still love you, though).    i thought about it during grading week -- and i was thinking about blogging about it then, but chose to stick to grading instead -- but *isn't* it fascinating.   It seems like so many sociological things are going on in this post.   Here are the two that fascinated me the most...  1.) blogrolling becomes a symbol with a particular meaning.  i mean this is probably not a hugely surprising thing -- that people attribute meanings to actions -- but i still find it fascinating.  Because the obvious move when reading a blogroll is to attribute meaning/motivation to the particular blogs that are noted.  which *does* happen in this post, i'll get to that in a moment though.  the less obvious move is to assume that the technical dimensions of the blog signify an intentional move on the part of the blogger.    blogrolls -- the list of blogs to the right of the text -- seem to be a really normal part of blogging.  everybody has some.  it just wouldn't be a blog without them.  so on some level, you wouldn't even think of having a blog that didn't have ANY links to the side.  OR if you did have such a blog (many starting bloggers) you'd be AWARE that *sometime* you needed to add those links.   Those of you who have read my blog over the past while have noticed how i have framed and reframed my blogroll.  ok, maybe you haven't, maybe you aren't as DEEPLY involved in the nuances of my expressive behaviour as i presume you to be...but the truth is...i've retitled my blogroll about three times....  because i feel keenly aware that there's this indeterminacy of meaning that still surrounds the medium of blogging.  once my brother ripped on me because i title my posts.  so yeah, he's write. why title?  its not neccessarily a given generic convention.  you don't HAVE TO have titles for posts.  So why do it?   Because I'm holding on to a generic convention from the olden days when books and chapters had titles.    Which performs a whole bunch of interesting realities about blogging for me.  I think that it signifies that you're not reading a personal letter, or a diary, or a journal, that on *some* level there is a FOCUS or a theme or a spine to my entries (though, i am perfectly aware, these centres may not always be completely obvious to all readers), it announces that the tone of my writing is more formal -- not formal as in stuffy, but formal as in conventionally oriented toward a generalized audience.  But I'm not the only one holding on to generic conventions.  We all are.  We all do.  It's all we CAN do.  Genres are (excuse the diversion into class lingo, former students,) social contracts -- agreements about the codes we're co-participating in.  So when we get to a phenomenon like blogrolling, to which genre do we refer?   what other texts get shaped by quick associative links?    i immediately think of bumper stickers and sewn on patches on clothes...of course in the blog (above), Joshua refers to a party where people are namedropping -- a form of social discourse that I'm *really* turned off by too -- instead of talking.    But if you read the comments that follow Joshua's rant -- you'll see that people have all kind of differing motivations for blogrolling -- some seem to be a little bit poseur motivations -- others seem really legitimate and important...  During the initial introduction of any new technology -- there are all kind of chaotic, liminal, experimental responses.  People play with social conventions -- trying to find new ways of communicating which allow them the same degree of freedom to be themselves and balance that freedom (at some level) with the needs of the group with which they're using the technology.    To me blogging and blogrolling seems particularly surprising and fascinating though, because so many diverse groups of people from so many different *places* (literally and figuratively) are co-active in trying to shape and constrain meaning...in the process -- people are deeply protective of things they love -- that reflect values that they have nurtured, and profoundly attuned to the practices that potentially erode those values, those practices, that possibility.   In the case of this blog -- RELATING is a value that gets protected over POSING -- but the unfortunate (& unanticipated?) consequence of this distinction is that really clear BOUNDARIES emerge. Such and such is ingroup behaviour.  Violations of ingroup behaviour are, officially now, outgroup behaviour.  Its such a normal process for ingroups and outgroups to get defined by the interpretations of behaviour...but its always disappointing if you're not in the ingroup.    But in a sense this process -- the process by which people gain legitimacy and groups retain their boundaries / definitions -- is like the SETTLING process in my house.  If it weren't for the bumping, jarring & jumping in my  house -- the house COULDN'T settle.  It couldn't be solid.  And the solidity of ANY group is dependent upon *both* the density and fixity of connection between the group members *and* upon the forces which work against the solidarity of the group, therefore solidifying the connection of it...  sociological insight two -- which will be (post)poned deals with the substance of those connections -- words & symbols -- hope & decay...  but i've gotta do some "real" work -- stuff that supports a "real" institution -- and the "real" discourse that makes that "real" institution have the capacity to pay me in "real" wealth.  a note to the (unbelievably tenacious) reader who is still reading...i'm address bookless right now.  Just moved to a new machine, and am hoping that all my old emails and old addresses are en route.  There are some of you who i can't wait to respond to.... (others, outgrouppers?  my old emails and old addresses must have gotten "lost in the mail...")

      .......... ouch. ..........  i kinda like that in cyber world i've been frozen in the permanent gesture of "ugh." for several days.    it's a poignant metaphor for how the family system is doing.   sunday -- the last of advent -- lynn and i were sprawled across the couches in the living room trying to keep our eyelids up high enough to regret missing the last sunday in the liturgical cycle -- enough to make sure that jae & add weren't taking the keys to the minivan and hitting the road.  lynn said she was worried that someone would just find our bodies all huddled together in the house together.    we've never been sick at the same time in eleven years of cohabitation & now to be facing this crud with two small humans fairly dependent upon us.  lets just say that all my moral objections to convenience food were overwhelmed in the struggle to survive.   (also a revelatory incident about who gets to complain about mass/kitsch culture...only we who have the werewithall to see it from above...instead of from inside...)  (hmm. on second thought, if i had a strikethrough key (or knew the html code for it) i'd psuedo-undo that comment, its a bit smug, isn't it, to imagine that you have the better vantage point...i've been thinking alot about vantage points, knowledge and membership these past few days...)  my friend Gary recommended this graphic novel --    urlLink     and so i just opened it at our christmas celebration this morning (thanks, baby!).  i'm almost halfway through already.    and that's the OUCH. from the title.   The author (so far) writes about coming of age in evangelical fundamentalism.  a terrain more familiar to me than any other.  and I realize that what's moving me so much about reading this book is to realize that this total stranger -- who has survived enough to put together an amazing novel -- experience(s/d) these wounds that i feel so profoundly.   I said to Lynn:  and sometimes I just look around me at the evangelical world and it looks like more people than not are just signing on the dotted line, saying, hey, yeah! me too! i want in for another generation!    and i can understand that rationally but i can't feel it very well at all.    i usually use cynicism and irony to talk about growing up in the church.  it's a much more comfortable stance in response.  but this guy's writing is doing the other thing. what seems like the faithful thing.  He's just saying --   ouch.  i'm gonna write more sometime here...but not today...its the andy-lynn-jaelyn-addison Christmas -- we're off to the farm tomorrow and Michigan after...  peace~

      ................................................. symbols, rotten with perfection .................................................  i blogged about the role of emerging media in shaping a discourse in a  urlLink a blog  a few days ago...  tonight i wanted to briefly offer part two.  in this  urlLink particular case , the "emerging cool alternative" wannabes are linked to a pretty widespread, but still pretty diffuse and developmental, movement which is most often being called "emergent" -- for some emergent church, for others emergent culture.   obviously i could spend a lot of time talking about the implications of *this* term EMERGENT -- but that is SO not the point that I want to focus on.  What I think is interesting is something that happens in this cycle, but it happens so often and in so many ways that it seems worth commenting on --   the term itself -- emergent -- is not a neccessary or fated term that was needed or arrived upon as the ONLY or BEST term to use to bind together a group of people.  It did, for whatever reason, though, become a term that "fit" just the right number of people with interests in common AND that gave *leeway* to just enough people who disagreed that it became a touchstone for this particular social movement.   But what's interesting to me is that its already in this position (in the case of this blog entry) where it is being used as a code to ingroup and outgroup.  In other words, the term is starting to rigidify.  Names have to do that, don't they?  Because if they actually just stand for agreements -- implicit contracts (as opposed to articulating some kind of implicit unequivocal nature) -- then they have to bind in some way.  And its particularly ironic in this case -- or in any case where a social movement wants to be positioned as counter- or radical or revolutionary.  Because as soon as you find a symbol that will do for the job you have in mind, you've already started to define the death of your own movement.  What was fringe is becoming central....  Russ commented on thrifting being co-opted by the preps (after this  urlLink blog  entry -- when will Russ get a blog?! He's such a natural! And while I'm at it -- where's the best music list for this year, Russ?).   urlLink Merchants of Cool  articulates the practice of coolhunting -- which is the same sociological phenomenon, only its being run by big corporations.  My blog title emerges from the writings of one of my critical forbearers --  urlLink Kenneth Burke .   He loved this idea that all symbols are shot through with a future arc.  That they don't just act as contracts about the way things are between us -- but that they're prophecies about the future that will be worked out between us, too.    There was a radio station in my hometown when I was going to high school that was bought out by a national chain and changed their identity to the NEW sunny fm.  Only they were the NEW sunny fm for at least four years.  I remember that we would debate about where they got their sense of legitimacy to maintain the term -- was it because no local stations were newer?  Because the top 40 hits they played were constantly (re)fresh(ed)?  So the contract that anyone ever wanted to have with Sunny FM had expired -- long before the station did -- because the symbol that they chose to employ to constitute a public -- went rotten.  The thing is -- this is related to my musings about liminal identity, too.    I've usually tried to resist being pulled into the centre of discourse in most of the institutions that I've been a part of.  I try to craft a position that's deliberately liminal -- that allows for the chaos.  Such a neither/nor position is a position that doesn't risk investment in a symbol.  And if you don't risk investing yourself with a symbol (like Emergent or New or Liberal or whatever...) your relevance won't fade with the insitution.    But the kicker is -- neither will you have fully established contracts with anyone -- or at least not with any "public."  You're doomed to a dogma of the American Individualist -- always open to the possibility of personal reinvention, but irrelevant to what's happening on a larger scale...  Sorry to blather on...  No more theory for a few days, eh?  Peace~

      ................................................... wobbly teeth * celebrity dreams ...................................................  Tonight we were riding home from the grocery store when suddenly a LONG profound silence from Jaelyn pooled in the back seat.  I turned around and turned on the overhead light.   Have I told you before that my daughter who has the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes in the universe also has an uncanny ability to spill buckets of tears from those eyes at will?    I’m not talking about crying.  I’m talking about a unique ability to sit silently, wide eyed and cry tears so violently that her face is soaking within a minute?   The moisture is building in her eyes.  ME: What is it Jaelyn?   Niagra Falls.  JAELYN: I almost broke my tooth.  ME: You what?   Have I told you before that my daughter has the most astonishing oral fixation yet documented (in my somewhat limited experience with such things) in a four-year-old?  That she not only chews her fingernails and hangnails and dolls feet and hands and teddy bear paws, but also the sleeves of all of her shirts.  And what’s more – tonight, she decided to chew – to pull violently – to … I don’t know what she was doing…snapping her elastic black pants with her teeth?    And sure enough, one of her front lower teeth is loose.  It was such an interesting moment, because the flood of her tears came to feel like Eden lost...they were genuinely pentitent, but neither she nor I could do nothing to reverse the angels at the gates with the flaming swords.  Everythingteeth.com (or something like that) assured us that four year olds are the right age to lose their teeth (even if mother nature gets a bit of help).  I cuddled her on the couch as she sobbed after I explained that the tooth would probably fall out, and though she would have a hole in her smile, a new tooth would eventually grow.  Its amazing and horrible to feel the weight of a four year old dealing with the profound understanding that a choice she has made is undoable.   Is it true that in general, as a child, you get used to the idea that the world is not so much fixed as it is routine?  That all that happens may well be purged and cleansed by the next time around?  New Years doesn’t matter because years aren’t picking up speed and there's no great loss if you miss an opportunity this time, because it doesn't affect all the future opportunities you'll ever have....?  Freudian psychologists say that if you dream that your teeth are falling out – you’re fearing your own mortality.  I don’t dream my teeth falling out, but I have been dreaming ALL THE TIME of being on trips – to far away places – amalgams of places I’ve lived and places I’d like to go.  In every case, I run into old friends, and together we spend time with more recent friends.  And I know that something is about to happen in these dreams.    Oddly enough (this is very strange for me), I’ve had celebrity dreams twice in the last week.  Last night I was hanging with a bunch of friends (Burt, Brenda, Brendon, Natalie & Lynn) in a library that overlooked the Santa Monica Beach.  And what’ya know….guess who was there?  Jennifer Anniston!  She engaged me in some banter about the note I had sent Brad.  She’s been so funny about pretending that I’m really the snooty one to get to know – and people accuse HER of it! Imagine!  Two nights before that an old family friend that Lynn and I share – who just happened to be a dignitary in Iran before the Shah fell, asked Lynn and I to take Sheryl Crow to lunch at the local casino.  He wanted to get our opinion of her before he asked her to sing at a fundraising lunch he was having.  She was also very funny, really joking around and everything with us.    I’m not the guy who’s a star-f*$#er.  I really have very few parasocial relationships with media figures, and I’m only interested in the phenomenon of celebrity in a very distant objective way.    So what do these dreams mean?    Will Jaelyn’s tooth fall out?   Stay tuned in 2004   for answers to these questions…  …and more.  peace~

      ……………………….. Happy New Year ………………………..  Do you make new years resolutions?    For the first five years of my adulthood I asked everyone I knew and met that question when this time of the year rolled around.  I needed to figure out who I wanted to be in regard to this particular ritual.   There’s so much I like about New Years Resolutions – but over and over again – I’ve made them and failed to keep them.  Occasionally one or two (out of ten or eleven) have stuck, but enough failures have governed my expeience of the new years resolution that every few years I swear them off altogether.   This year – they seem like an embodiment of hope.  You know, the endless possibility that we’ll manage to do something better.   One thing is for sure – I’m going to always stay devoted to my new tradition (sorta new anyway)  New Years Reflection.  Today I glanced back through a bunch of journaling that I did during the summertime, all my old blogs (something like 100 pages in word – I guess I’ve written a book), some of my tenure documents, my perennially amended “List of Thirty Things I Want to do Before I Die” and other scraps of reflection from previous years.  I sewed them all together in a 25 page document in order to spare YOU, dear reader, from reading all the things I’m thinking about in regard to myself, the world, and change (because that’s what New Years is about right?).  In the end, I ended up with QUESTIONS instead of RESOLUTIONS.  I really like this idea.  It’s more my groove.  1.	How can I increasingly faithfully tell stories to the audiences I have?  How can I faithfully tell stories in a way that will develop my voice?  2.	How can I bring SHALOM and JUSTICE to the people who live around me? 3.	How can I sustain an identity comfortable in the interstices & devoted to the margins while still participating in the life of the institutions with which I’m engaged?  4.	(to those around me) What do you want next? What do you want most?   I love this last one.  It’s a question that welled up in a journal on my birthday last year.    I think I’ve failed more profoundly with that one than all the others (perhaps because it’s the one that I’m best equipped to do) these last five or six months – but that’s a different list. Not for the blog. You thought my sincerity posting “ouch” from a few weeks ago was painful – just imagine the tasteless solipsism of being subjected to a list of GREATEST FAILURES FROM THIS YEAR.  But I have hope. Loads of it.  Hope you’re off to a good start thus far in 2004.  Been thinking of you lots lately (unless I don’t know you, in which case, I speculate about you a lot.)  peace~

      ......... oops. .........  i've got a three post running cycle of one word title postings.   remember how i liked the idea that i was frozen in a kind of long-term ugh....  while i was driving (far from connectibility) and opening presents and hanging with the fam -- I decided that I *didn't* like being frozen in a long term "ouch".  I still love _Blankets_ and i still feel scarred by fundamentalism -- but the idea of being in a position of "genuine" emotional pain for however-many-days-that-post-has-topped-my-blog seems embarrassing to me.   like i'm a guy who's just constantly "put upon by the the world, and nobody 'gets' him..." to quote a favorite movie (_the good girl_) from this year...  and again my meta-analytical thinking is about the nature of speech in different mediums.  The way that writing / text / archives FREEZE the different inflections and gestures and poses that together compose our wholeness...feels a bit dangerous.  Because if the wrong inflection gets frozen for too long, then it becomes the definitive one.   But aren't we always doing that as we think about our relationships with people?  They become more and less of this or that as we think about them more in terms of their THIS and less in terms of their THAT.  Anyone else exhausted by holiday cheer? spreading Christmas across days and miles and families takes so much intention...  tonight should be fun -- we're following family tradition -- for the third year in a row -- traipsing off to see Return of the King -- I'm excited...haven't been this excited for a movie since the anticipation of schoolhouse rock (love R. Linklater + love M. White= will overlook J. Black).  I'm officially disappointed by the movie (upon consideration, Ryan & Josh, if you're reading)....tho' I think its a fine rental for anyone who wants an entertaining movie....Just not what I'd expect from a collaboration between Linklater and White....  peace~

      ............ quilts ............  am just trying to get prepped for the semester -- the front burner flame is on high -- but I'm excited about the flames (a switch from last semester).  Have been really enjoying hearing from old friends.  Marcaus' voice returned to his blog, and I happened to stumble across a number of old pictures and emails when i cleaned my old computer up -- its good to have old friends who remain true and connected.  I have a deep sense of that.   My mentor from my MA at Andrews, Bev, sent me a handwritten letter. She often does.  It's SO good to get a real live LETTER.  And so good to feel that someone from the past who invested in you still cares.  She'd never know how deeply appreciative I continue to be of her voice in my life from the lack of my correspondence, but I am (deeply appreciative).   We spent new years eve with Greg, Andrea & tribe.  It was warm, honest, caring, delicious, rich, heady time.  Its amazing when you are friends with people from a long time and you start to recognize how much you've changed individually, but how the arcs and rhythms and patterns of your lives continue to be so intersected...  Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed by quilts these days.  Not making them or even looking at them, just wrapping them around me and doing whatever -- reading, movies, writing, talking....  My wife's family has made billions of amazing quilts and they're draped all over this house, but they seem to me to be the perfect object -- an INCARNATION of all that I'm feeling about me and the world right now.    I'm feeling bolstered, secured, warmed, kept and loved by these meaningful connections with people who have loved me for a long time and in really unique ways...The patterns that are emerging in these long-time friendships are unexpected -- they stitch together different parts to the fabric of my life that I couldn't have expected to work together in the ways that they do...  But I feel warmed, filled, re-membered.  peace~.

      ........ t.v. ........  honoring a long-standing obsession (which i've grown very weary of) i watched the premiere last night of the Real World San Diego.  the obvious critique to offer is:  could this "real" world *be* more about sex?   but i'm bored by that critique (much like i was bored with the sex storylines in the show last night), it seems to me that most of the time when people are freaking out about the amount of sex in the media -- they're kind of freaking out because they're so scared of it.  like it (sex) has this amazing amount of importance and sway over them.   which it does.  for me too.  but the objection against showing it -- when its clearly so much a part of the human psyche?  c'mon.  anyway.  the thing which I  DID find really interesting was this quote (which i'm only kind of getting right) by the character Frankie (STEREOTYPE: highschool geek, openminded piercer-tattoo-esque, porn-shop working, but i have a boyfriend back home + INTERESTING TWIST: has cystic fibrosis):  "I've always had this dream of moving to a new city and getting to reinvent myself completely."  The world went into slow motion for me. It seemed SO right on.  This is TOTALLY the mythos of most emerging Reality Programming, isn't it?    and its such a particular now kind of fantasy  / dream / myth too, eh?   premised upon a globalizing culture and a leisure class whose identity is formulated primarily by consumption habits...  i know that this blog hovers dangerously close to my front burner, and don't you worry, i'll definitely be ranting about it in my Mass Media class this semester.  If anyone sees any writing (articles, essays, blogs, books) about this emerging fantasy -- i'd be grateful...

      ................... more theory ...................  i have a theory, but its just as much a question as it is a belief (at least at this stage).  why do people care?  about anything?  why do they lend their lives to certain jobs or institutions or places or groups?   that's the question my theory answers.    here's the theory:    everyone has -- at their core some kind of deeply embedded conflict.  This conflict may have caused them a great deal of pain in their youth, or it may have just been a fear that's been simmering forever unsaid.    so everyone does -- something that addresses that pain or that fear.  What people do with their lives offers themselves the best reassurance that they are solving the problem, addressing the problem or facing the problem.   and i mean *everyone* (remember its a theory and a question).   so i don't believe that there are people who do things because its the easy way out or because its what was expected of them or because its the only model they ever saw.    I think all those factors focus and direct the kinds of choices we make, but ultimately, i'm suggesting that everyone's life should be read as: motivated action.    (i'm not saying that people have as many choices as they want to have or that they have concious control over most of their choices.)  so what?    hmm.  i don't know?  its a therapeutic model for me.  i gradually recognize more and more how everything i choose in life is organized across the same fault lines.    ~peace.

      ................ ...shhhh.... ................  my office is completely quiet right now. (which never happens.)   i realize that i haven't had many minutes of completely quiet during this entire break.   two days in pajamas after new years with the fam -- were very sabbath-y, but not quiet.  Jaelyn got new braids today -- her stylist is named Whisper.  It was a tragic, tender-headed experience in the downtown mall, J.C.Penney salon.  The only moments of joy were when I invented a story in which Addison and I had ridden a runaway escalator up, up, up through the roof of the mall, past the clouds only to be rescued at the last possible minute by a recurring character in my stories -- Mortimer the seagull.  Mort also perches on the dock in front of the family cottage in while we eat dinner in the summertime, looking out over Mackinac Bay.   Outside I think that the (newly) freezing temperature has frozen the entire world in a grey cloudy, leave-less, snow-less funk.    On a whim on Saturday morning I made pomengranate sauce (remember my dream from over a month ago).  It turned out beautifully.  I'm a happy man.   My grandma Marge sent me a draft of her story -- Through the Register -- I'm living in the pools of my grandparents stories thinking about what they mean to me / about me.  Jodi breezed through town last night and we loved looking @ pictures of her trip to Egypt.   Watched SPIDER this weekend.  VERY provocative film.  I liked it a lot, but don't count that as a recommendation until we have a conversation about it...  ~peace.

      ........................................ do I have big stories inside? ........................................  Here’s how I feel today:  (is this a danger of public journaling? Feeling out loud in public?  Especially when a sentence is modified with the word, “today?”)  I feel like a reasonably disciplined and moderately talented writer who doesn’t have any stories to tell.    I mean that’s not true.  I feel like I have plenty of stories to tell.    But no GRAND IMPORTANT PERFECT stories.   So what does that mean?  Should I not write toward big audiences?  Should I stick to my blog?  Should I write short stories for obscure literary journals?    I guess its just that I’ve worked hard enough on enough stories to know what it feels like when you get to the end of a YEAR of writing a story and realize whats wrong with it.  Or you get to the end of several years of writing and revising a story and you realize: well that’s a cool story, and I could fix it – but ultimately it doesn’t SAY anything that I’m that devoted to saying.  But everybody knows that you can’t write stories to make points.  If you want to go into that business – you should be a preacher like your father and all your brothers.  Or an academic like you’re trained to be…  Anyway,   that’s how I feel today…  not bad, just not sure.   peace~

      ................... post it notes ...................  have you seen the thing where people cover an office door or a cubicle in post it notes -- that say something?  or make a design with color?   is there a verb form for that kind of minor office terrorism?   like t.p.ing with toilet paper?   when lynn was a high school english teacher, one night one of her favorite classes celebrated the end of a unit on Romeo and Juliet by plastic forking the pages of the play across our entire lawn in the middle of the night.  You literally couldn't see any grass at all.   Ritual House Assault, my pop culture mentor, Jack Santino at BGSU called it.   Just like the time that our neighbors subtly expressed their dissatisfaction by filling our mailbox with grass when our lawn had gotten much longer than it should have (during the writing of our dissertation).   Santino said it was the equivalent of burning in effigy back in the day when people used to publicly sanction extra-marital affairs or unfair social policy.  there's something glorious about office pranks, though, when they instruments of oppression to subvert the grind...  anyone?  postiting? (feels awkwardly like prostating to me -- and yes, i mean prostating not prostrating...)  curious ~

      ............................. shocking hypothesis .............................  haven't been blogging because:    1. front burner just firing up (beginning of a new semester) *and*  2. i really like my front burners right now -- job particularly...  and it makes me think that blogging last semester was a low cost, quickie form of escapism from the feeling that i wasn't quite so fond of my front burner.   I say that, but i know that its also true that i found it really rewarding to be in the presence of several people who i feel quite confident read regularly...  and it is to you whom i direct this quick posting.   sorry i've not been writing....  so, yeah, i guess the shocking discovery wasn't so shocking:  i'm a bit of an escapist.  or is it escaper?   I was thinking that even the act of watching the real world -- particularly inasmuch as i watch it to "escape" (which everybody does a little bit when we engage fiction, don't we?) actually matches that mythos that i was describing a few days ago.  That whole longing to escape our own particular pasts and particular dreams and start anew with a new pallette or canvas or something....  hope you're good!  peace~

      ............. baaaaah .............  Jaelyn is at a growth stage where she’s eating voraciously.  I mean – girl is EATING.   She could give the big bad wolf a run for his money (or for the nearest little pigs house – depending on how close you want to stay to the story).  So I’ve been trying to teach her this technique for assessing how full she is – before she mindlessly consumes the entire table spread before her.   She was teaching the same technique to Lynn the other day when Lynn said “I can’t stop eating these….”   “Mommy,” she said, “First you’ve got to close your eyes. Then you’ve got to take a deep breath [so far this is word-for-word my technique].  Then you’ve got to count TEN SHEEP. [?!?] Then you’ll know if your belly is full.”    Ten sheep?  Well apparently Jaelyn has recognized (and conflated) the commonalities of the various meta-scripts I’ve been giving her to talk herself into / out of things – counting sheep is the classic help-you-get-to-sleep routine.    But it cracks me up that now each time my daughter wants to engage in a reflective decision, a meditative examination of her self and practices, she closes her eyes, and…  …in wander the sheep.  I can just see it now in ten years when its my turn to say the infamous line: “if all your friends were jumping off of a bridge, would you jump too?” – and then later as her friends hold a smoldering cigarette in her direction, and she’s considering whether to light up with them -- an uninvited herd of sheep come galloping out over the edge of a bridge in her imagination –   peace~

      Two really significant things happened to me in the last twenty four hours.    (I'm sure other really significant things happened to me in that time frame, but I just don't know why they're significant yet.)  One. Jaelyn's tooth came out.    Two. Julie Bemis gave me an amazing scarf.  We were sitting at dinner and, as always, at dinner, we're trying to enjoy our meal -- cultivate an atmosphere of conversation -- and teach our children ettiquette.  Right now we're not at the stage where we order our forks or determine whether its most polite to introduce the friends grandmother first or the visiting diplomat.  We're trying to just get our kids to stay in their seats at the table until a whole unit of time has passed (eg. family meal time).    BTW, it never sounds quite as honorable as "ettiquette training" sounds in theory when you're in the trenches.  It roughly translates into:   "Addison I want you to SIT with your BOTTOM on that SEAT until we are FINISHED eating our SUPPER."  (to which my son, inevitably concerned with the theoretical endlessness of the unmarked future, asks: But, DADDY.  How we be all done?  -- which means -- When can *i* be done?)  So into this circus of trying to be calm and invite conversation and banter about days and police bottoms that are popping out of chairs, enters --   The curdling horror stricken cries of Jaelyn.  (Who is, of course, sitting right between Lynn and I...apparently...except for the cries....fine.)    Has she bitten her tongue?  Her cheek?  Stubbed her toe?  OR -- as a scream of this volume and vibrancy would merit -- has she accidentally sliced off her finger with an errant steak knife?  We ask all of these questions to her, but she cannot stop sobbing.    Finally.  "My tooth came out."  I know that there's an incipient sense of tragedy whenever part of your body falls off -- and that the gradual loss of hair and skin and fingernails gradually hardens us to it -- but not so with kids.  Pulled off hair, skin and the threat of fingernail clippers are as tragic as pools of blood.  But your TEETH.  They're so...YOU!  Within minutes we are all celebrating the event.  Jaelyn, too.  She pries open her hand, extends the small, impossibly small, ridiculously tiny inscisor out to us.    This is an important night, I tell her. This is the first night you lost your tooth.    I didn't tell her how much MORE relieved Lynn and I were to see a new tooth coming in already behind the newly departed one...  We feared that this loss was premature and, no matter how out of our control the circumstances of its demise were, as parents we still felt an onus of responsibility. But AH! this tooth was MEANT to come out.  Destined to come out.  A NEW tooth has arrived.   She danced in circles.  And I have to admit, I started to believe her just as much.  She told everyone at the YMCA when we went to work out later -- This is an Important Night for me.  This IS an Important Night for ALL OF US.  Once she was sleeping, i creep into her bedroom to assess the difficulty of the tooth fairying that Lynn or I will do later tonight.  Usually she sprawls in every imaginable direction on her bed.  Not tonight.  Tonight her head is carefully and squarely planted on the middle of the pillow covered by symmetrical ballet dancers arranged on the felt of the pillow case that Grandma Glo sewed for Christmas.  I decide to check on her when I wake up.  Surely by then she will have sprawled in another direction.   But I have to tell you, I went to bed with this queasy feeling in my stomach.  So much was riding on this performance.  What if my alarm didn't go off?  What if she woke up at the ridiculous absurd hour of five o three -- beating me by the seven minutes of snooze that I always allow for in the morning?    So five o'clock came, and as i crept into the room, I have to admit, my body was filled with adrenaline.  If I thought the alarm clock was precarious....the present mission that faced me proved that my fears last night were the immature underdeveloped fears of a novice. Here -- in the chrysalis of my glory or defeat -- i understood the true magnitude of the stakes.    I knew that step one was: gently lift the pillow.  Think of what could happen here.  In that moment!  My daughters beautiful brown eyes could fly open.  Wide awake on a dime.  And she would be looking at me. Right in my eyes in the middle of the dark of her bedroom.  And her feelings of surprise and startle would last only for the moment that it took her to realize: It's a sham!  There's NO tooth fairy!  I'm participating in a pre-medieval-ist practice!  It's pagan!  It's absurd!  She would swallow and in a croaky voice say, "Daddy, what you're doing?"  Wait, no wait, this wasn't an unrecoverable error.  I could still keep my cover:   "Go to sleep honey," I could say.  "Everything's Okay."  and slip out of the room.  The ruse still intact.    By the time I finish with this hypothetical, I'm almost over to the bed.  Stepping carefully so as to not activate the beeping electronic voice of the blues clues telephone and not to shred my bare foot on the jagged edges of (my nemesis) Barbie's house...  Step Two:  Pull out the plastic bag which Lynn had (so judiciously) suggested we place the tooth in. Did everybody put their teeth in plastic bags for the tooth fairy?  I don't remember if I did?  But how in the world could generations before me have gone through this particular agony if they had to swipe their hand everywhere across the rumpled sheets, looking for such a tiny bit of enamel? (Lynn! thank you! plastic bags save the universe again...and, of course, ironically, also manage to ruin the environment at the same time...)  (Part of me wonders how Sidney does it every week?  I could never be the star of _alias_.  Well at least I could never be the real - live counterparts for the fictional characters represented on _alias_.  Not that alias is really rooted in some kind of verite' programming....)  (the other part of me says, sure I could do it every week.  Everything becomes natural if you do it enough...)  BUT don't be too confident here! I argue back.  Every single motion must be intentional -- every reflex attuned.  Because, I have decided, if those brown eyes flutter open while I'm holding the bag -- I'm made.  There's nothing to do.   Finally I'm standing at the bed.    I'm practically hyperventilating.    E.B. White wrote an essay which I love called "once more to the lake" and he narrates the strange disembodiement of returning with his children to a cabin and lake where he spent his childhood.  How strange it is to become one's father and to see one's progeny both as themselves and as ones' self.  Here I go, I think, as I reach for the pillow, I'm diving into pools and pools of tradition; generations of careful deception.  I am (the pillow only barely touches the top of her head as I fold it back) the tooth fairy (the bag slides out with no problem).  I am the tooth fairy (and i half tiptoe, half leap out of the room before she will stir.  (Not that it matters -- but J. thought the tooth fairy generous with four coins...I should guess so!  When I was her age, i was lucky to get an entire penny for one tooth...)  Two.  Julie Bemis knitted the MOST amazing scarf.   When I was in college, my roommate, Jonathon Montgomery had the LONGEST scarf I had ever seen.  It was black and white stripes (horizontally) and wound around and around his neck and still hung (i'm convinced) past his waist.   One week we kidnapped the scarf and left a series of ransom notes featuring photos and videos of the scarf in (ahem) compromising positions.  It was three weeks of fun.  Ahh the crazy college capers of fundamentalists separated from the world by a vast cornfield and an even vaster sense of guilt and atonement....scarf kidnapping was FREE happiness.  No sin here.  But I hadn't thought about that scarf for years until I got this one.    I was thrilled to recognize my new scarf's antecedent.  That original scarf, like almost everything else about Jonathon, makes me think about being creative and free.  Jonathon wrote poetry like a madman.  Occasionally, obsessively, absurdly, delightfully.  He performed his poetry regularly.  With or without an invitation.   One night he missed curfew and we didn't turn in his MIA status because we knew he was Jonathon, and sure enough the story he told us midday the next day was that he had followed a long pair of train tracks until they led him to the most comfortable tree he had ever sat in.  So comfortable, in fact, that he fell asleep and slept there in the tree til late the next morning.  For some an impossible feat, for double-jointed, unpredictable Jonathon?  A perfectly legitimate explanation.     As he would listen to the pogues on his headset, he worked to cover one of our dorm room walls with black and white photographs, clippings and images.  One afternoon I awoke from a nap to find a decapitated Hitler staring at me from the wall.  On another day I returned to find that he had sliced my LEVI 501 posters along random lines throughout the pictures.   He had clearly made an improvement.  One semester he didn't show up. I feel proud that I started the rumour that he was travelling in Bolivia.  What was a credit to Jonathon, was that most people shrugged and said, "Cool."  And remember, this is the late eighties, a slightly less global era, in the middle of Ohio (where people, in general, do not venture to leave) and also in the heart of evangelical fundamentalism (where the only travelling we do is to "spread the gospel") -- and disappearing to Bolivia suddenly would be quite a big deal for most of us.  But not for Jonathon.   Occasionally he would hear me begin a tirade against legalism or injustice.  But what was amazing about Jonathon was that he would look at me like my anger was a curiousity -- but with a simple gesture or group of words he would DO justice or shalom or grace in the direction of my discontent.  He could affirm the healing that was needed without belaboring (as I so often do) the significance and impacts of all the harms of all the systems of the world.  So anyway this amazing scarf I've been wearing all day -- it clearly has a spiritual, shamanic quality to it.  I feel that I can enter any room with more gravity and levity -- all together simplly by placing it around my neck.  It's like a blanket and a prayer shawl and a mantel.   I think I'm naming it.  I want a name that refers backward to all the goodness that Jonathon invested into my world -- and that refers to all the struggle and possibility that defines Bemis' world right now...  The mantle of freedom and possibility.   So I haven't talked to nor heard from Jonathon in at least eight or nine years.  But I'd love to.  So some late night when his wife is ego-surfing in google for him (because he's not really the type to ego surf) -- she'll call him over.  Hey, honey, look at this blog!  This is your name!  Do you know this guy?  Didn't you go to college in a cornfield?    And then finally I'll get to say thanks to my friend for the symbols and the richness and -- of course -- for making me be able to enjoy this gift so much.   And in the slightly more promising happenstance that one of my favorite non-emotional / super-emotive debators happens across this blog -- THANK YOU, Bemis!  This took so much work. It's SO amazing.  I promise you TWO episodes of Queer Eye at my  house.  And dinner sometime.   Peace~

      you'll never believe what barbie said... ..........................................................  yesterday morning i was chillin with jaelyn, playing with barbies with her (at her request, and yes, i'm mortified that my child even *has* barbies -- don't worry they're at least non-white barbies) when my barbie said, "mommy I think i'm going to run for president this year..."  "girls can't be presidents only boys."  daddy wants to jump out of his skin....what!?!?!....but instead, his barbie calmly climbs up the pillow to gather rhetorical poise, and she says, "girls can too be presidents.  They can be anything they want to be!"  her barbie said: "I don't want to run for president because i need to stay at home and take care of my adopted babies."  now don't get me wrong here, i'm REALLY glad that my daughter has a strong nurturing instinct.  but where did she get this idea...  my barbie says, "why doesn't their daddy take care of them while you're the president?"  "because," she answers matter of factly, "the daddy has to go on trips and i need to stay at home with my honnys."  AHH! i'm never going on a trip again.  Lynn's going on two trips a semester.  How insidious?!?! how pervasive is this gender programming?!!!  (insidious and pervasive are both on the favorite word list.)  on the trip i just took we talked about gender quite a bit  -- and there's a  urlLink dialogue  going in the emergent church circles going on over the last few days....  I made on the trip -- a bold assertion that I'm going to make here again -- i'll only blog about it if it en*genders* (heh,heh, get it?) some interesting feedback....  "Gender (not sex) is in opposition to Cross / Gospel."  And just to ratchet up the inflammatory tone just slightly,  I'll admit that this statement was made as a critique of the promise-keepers movement *&* gay culture (as if there was *just one*)  thems the bait...any interested takers...  i remain...  barbies sworn enemy, but devoted to...  peace~

      its a snow day.    for me too!  it just feels like this huge gift has been given to me.  TIME.  This from the guy who doesn't believe at all in time...  who calls watches "institutional handcuffs"  and who is convinced that the invention and perpetuation of societal belief in "time" is the conspiracy of some folks who are trying to KEEP US DOWN.  (that's right.  the "man")  in any case...we've wriggled free for an afternoon and evening.  I'm off to frolic in the snow and sleet...

      ******************* favorite word/concepts *******************  i have lots of them, but don't keep a formal list anywhere (i guess til now), but upon prompting, the following tumble of word/concepts comes jumbling out of me as a favorite discursive corner in the world...  hazy, indeterminate, indistinct, translucent.  You get it?  There, but not quite there.  Available but not assured.  so when i bumped into  urlLink this place  this morning, I decided that such a place was built for me to visit...  ...anyone up for a trek to the great mythic North?

      ................................ discursively formed ................................  i've been away for the weekend with a group of students who i love.  no really, *love*.  it was a really great group.  a really rewarding time...  it was the sort of group that was constituted mostly of external - processers...so the experience was thick with commentary, punchline, idiom, and in-jokes.  by the end of the weekend Ann mentioned the sort of incipient disappointment at seeing it end.  Kristy took notes on it and ended up charting an entire universe of discourse.  after these sorts of time-out-of-time experiences -- everyone who participates comes away with a keen sense that there's a world we've created together.  and even though we'll temporally never be able to return to it -- its a world that will always inform our future worlds.  but then i came back this morning and checked my blogroll and found out that i (or at least the character i play on this blog) was popping up on several blogs.  And it felt great.  So. Thanks for making me real marcaus, kelly, trena, & bemis (albeit ambivalently so...).  oh yeah, and commenters too.  Russ, Ryan, Kleman, Skylark, Marcaus, Gary, my brothers....   i'll be thinking of y'all today...  peace~

      ............................ Change of Address. ............................  Hey everybody,   Good news.  I need you to change your address books again.  Sorry about that.  New cell phone.  New email.  Damn spam.  I’ve attached the details.  Au Revoir~   Hey! Wait!   What?   I said, wait a second.    But…   I just wondered what made you think that you could just decide to change?    Look this is an email message.  Or a posting.  You can’t really ask questions.    Or I could say: this is a relationship or a name.  You can’t really just decide to change the terms.  The contract.  The expectations.   Contract?    Names are contracts.   When I was a kid everybody always  knew me by the short form of my name.  I was cute.  That version of the name was cute, but I was starting to tire of it or aspire toward the REAL name, the longer version long before I graduated high school.    Riiight….?   So I decided to change it when I went to college.    See?  People do change their names.    Wrong.  People still knew me from home.  They undermined me.  They got to all the key people first somehow.  I don’t know how they managed it,  but somehow it didn’t matter how many times I corrected them,  reframed, introduced myself.  Always the boyhood name.    But we don’t call you that now.  We call you the “real” name.     You do, but its only a matter of time.  You’ll meet someone.  Hear a few stories.  Slip up in front of me.  Start to merge my identity with someone else who has the same name, only kept the boyhood version.    Look.  I was just sending out a notice that I changed my email address and my cell number.    And I’m just saying that don’t you think we should have some say in that?    Changing my email or cell?   Well who beckons you with these magical incantations?   Hunh?   Telephone numbers and email addresses are ways of summoning you by way of a magic code. If we know the magical combination of numbers and letters – PRESTO!  You can appear to us.  No matter where you were, what you were doing.  SUDDENLY you’re here with us.    Okay.  So shouldn’t I get to decide HOW you beckon me?   Since this magic…code (?) has so much power…?   Since when has anyone ever chosen their own name?          Since when  do we get to choose how people refer to us?     Ummm.  I guess since email?  I don’t know, though.  It seems like we get to choose what clothes we wear.  What houses we live in.  What schools we go to.   Really?!  Maybe cell phones are the beginning of real agency then.  True freedom.  Where we know our own true name, we decide who should have access to it and we re-create ourselves and our worlds accordingly.  We can be islands who build bridges only to the other islands that we like…   That’s my point…these technologies are covering their tracks as they carry us into a desert.  We’ll wake up in the middle of desolation and have no idea how we got there.  And I just didn’t want you to send out an email and post a cell phone number that made it look like you had CHOSEN – all of your own accord – to go to some new theoretical place.  When these choices are really making us over.  All of us.   Yeah.   So anyway.  I’ll call you sometime after my free minutes at nine.    Or text me.  No cost…   Au Revoir.

      Thomas Eugene Patterson Knowles announced over Easter dinner that he had decided to give up his faith for lent.  His sister Karen didn't even bother to roll her eyes, but reached in front of him for the creamy mashed potatoes.  His mother used real cream in the potatoes and beat them til they were heavenly (which is not to say that she beat the hell out of them, though, if she had not been a nazarene like her mother and father and her husband had always been, and if she had been more of the sort of sottish pagan that her maternal grandfather had been, in that case, she may have said, "beat the hell out." But what was the difference? she would ask if you brought up this point to her, why *not* say it the nice way?  Can't we use a bit of Heaven in this hot kitchen?  Thomas' father had heard him.  He stared at his roast beef as if it were a leprous cadaver.  Karen, once she recognized this silence, and all that would come with it...paused in shaping the countours of her potatoes so that the rivulets of butter could run down just exactly right...rolled her eyes at her brother.  Nancy Ann (Patterson) Knowles corrected her son: We don't celebrate lent, honey.  We're still nazarene.  Thomas looked around the table.  He looked at the pile of green beans pushing against the mashed potatoes.  I don't celebrate lent anymore either, mom.  Now she looked up at him.  You're not going to be a catholic anymore, son?  She looked at Eugene.  Had he heard this?  I gave up my FAITH for lent.  OH!  Now she rolled her eyes and joined her daughter in shaping their potatoes.  May as well craft an enjoyable plate to weather the oncoming storm.   You can't just give up your faith for lent!  Roared Eugene.  Lent is just a made up thing anyway!  Nancy Ann wished he wouldn't respond this way.  She wasn't sure but that her husband could end up with an annurism like Ted Johnson the deacon who had passed the offering plate to them for years.  And now, this week, out of the blue, ended up at Mercy Hospital in the prayer request section in the bulletin.   SHe had stopped taking their son seriously when he was fifteen. Why change when he was still just twenty eight?  Twenty eight year olds were practically toddlers.  If they must lose their faith...oh well.  Karen ate each bite enjoying it.  She allowed the warmth and the gentle interpenetration of the potatoes and cream and butter and salt fill her mouth and her body so full that she couldn't hear a thing.  Not a thing.   Thomas ate his dinner fiercely.  His father ate nothing.    When they had easter dinner together twenty years later, it was as if this dinner had determined everything for the two of them.  Thomas was fiercely obese at forty eight and his father looked as any fat had been transpanted from his bones to his son.  The blades of his shoulders by that time looked skeletal when he removed his sport jacket on Sunday, clad only then, in a practical cotton dress shirt from JC Pennys.  The long and short of the argument ended this way.   EUGENE: You shouldn't change your mind about everything until you study up on what you come from.  Maybe you need a bit of serious bible study son.  THOMAS: That's an unarguable argument, dad.    EUGENE: Well then...?  THOMAS:  What? Didn't you take any leaps of faith from where you were brought up?  (knowing full well the answer.)  And the great irony was, that after the mashed potatoes were gone, the dishes were cleared, and Thomas and Eugene had both disappeared into bitte silences, Thomas decided that he'd show his father up.  When they had dinner on easter in the year of Thomas' 48th year, Thomas had returned to the land.    He had traced the lineage of the family only as far back as the family homestead in Indiana.  No records went back any farther. For six years he worked as hard as he could to earn back the family homestead. He grew organic food, didn't use the phone or ride in cars.    When his father poked fun at him.  Thomas took the most joy of all in admonishing him:    You shouldn't change your mind about everything until you study up on what you come from.  Maybe you need a bit of serious bible study dad.  He couldn't have pointed to a bible verse to back up his luddite resistance, having abandon his faith twenty years hence, but he couldn't resist the completeness of the phrase.  His father was pained by it, would not respond, and to Thomas it seemed a glorious repudiating refrain to cling to.    Since he had set all the other lifeboats adrift already.

      I surfed into this article by  urlLink  Wendell Barry  today -- and there are some things about it that really resonated with me...  He writes:    People in movements too readily learn to deny to others the rights and privileges they demand for themselves. They too easily become unable to mean their own language, as when a “peace movement” becomes violent. They often become too specialized, as if finally they cannot help taking refuge in the pinhole vision of the institutional intellectuals. They almost always fail to be radical enough, dealing finally in effects rather than causes. Or they deal with single issues or single solutions, as if to assure themselves that they will not be radical enough.    to me, he articulates many of the problems that i associate with participating in institutions (as well as social movements).  In some ways "movements" are, i'm sure, more dangerous, because identity is more precarious for any given individual, and the sanctions of the group may be less anticipated -- and therefore more harsh -- than when within the protectively rigid structure of an organization.  Mandy and I are talking about these issues in our independent study -- and in my Mass Media class we were talking about how the emergence of the autonomous self was one of the precursors for celebrity culture -- that we had to be alone in order to need celebrities...  but the questions and issues seem to me to be so deeply intertwined with my, with anyone's quest for legitimacy, our need for importance, our desire for meaning, our direction for work...  are there institutions or movements with which we want to align our life force?    but if we don't, we're just nothing.  we can't exist in the world...  one more reason that being a prophet is a dangerous profession...

      do you ever have the feeling that *so* many people are thinking and writing that the public sphere is more like a cacauphonous din of competing voices.  Kind of like it sounds if you're at a HUGE dinner party and you stop having a little conversation of your own and just listen to the hum of a hundred conversations.    That's what blog-surfing feels like to me sometimes...

      tired people should not be allowed to:   1. drive. 2. write papers. 3. blog.  you wouldn't believe some of the things that the late night demons whisper in my ears to include on this blog...  (skeptical republican readers of this blog should not read this post as one more evidence that liberal ideology is all wrapped up in more intervention on behalf of Big Goverment.  Maybe tired people could be given tax breaks if they agree *not to* drive or blah,blah,blah...)

      .............................................................................................. top five bad things that have happened to me in the last week. ..............................................................................................  (not in order of importance)  1. i sliced open my thumb on the severed edge of the top of a cream of celery soup can. lots of blood.  2. i haven't had time to schedule a haircut.  3. i didn't finish reading two papers by my friday class last week.  4. i forgot to bring some stuff into school for my wife earlier today.  5. something's wrong with my telephone at home.   What!?  Is it my fault that I've got a good life?  Did you *read* this blog last semester?  Last semester it sucked to be me.  I refuse to feel guilty for feeling ok about the world.

      i have a bumper sticker on my office door that says "Jesus is a liberal."    An irate math student stopped at my door the other day and demanded an accounting for such a claim.  Was I saying that Jesus was like Bill Clinton?  I tried to be generous and provocative in my response to him, but I was forced to remember how totalizing the world I grew up in was toward the term.  The word "liberal" itself was justification for alientation and ridicule.  (I understand that many liberals live in the same sort of totalizing world -- where "conservative" is just a devil a term...)  since i've moved so far left, sometimes I have to try to remember how, in general,  urlLink the right came to hold such widespread, unquestioning cache' with the evangelicals ...?    i *do* understand some of the historical antecedents and the political bedfellows that made for this union between the american religious mainstream and the political right wing....but i also feel passionate about making arguments for why / how a more liberal political agenda is more consonant with historical christianity.  ****   urlLink Harry preached this sunday  focusing upon this text --   The Spirit of the Lord is on me,  because he has anointed me  to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners  and recovery of sight for the blind,  to release the oppressed,  to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.  Not from Isaiah, but from Luke 4 -- the passage where Jesus talks about how a prophet is -- in his own city -- reviled.    that latter idea really resonated with me.  For lots of reasons....  i joke that i'm a "black sheep" in my family -- and Lynn often feels keenly the weight of being the child that left her farming community -- being a "black sheep" does not (i'm aware) constitute being a prophet, but the experience does resonate with me as having some shared territory.   Isn't it a bedrock American Axiom that once you leave -- you can never go home?   Isn't that, on some level, the experience that most people face when they're honest about the intergenerational clash of values, directions, and dreams that they face with their parents?  I've just ordered   urlLink Limbo   after hearing  urlLink a great interview  of the author on NPR.   urlLink     I'm not really a  straddler  in Lubrano's sense, but having left fundamentalism and evangelicalism, both very dense & total cultural groups...and having married a "straddler" (as he calls them) who moved from rural agrarian roots into a white collar world -- his ideas resonated deeply with me.  Harry's point (or one of them at least) was that Jesus was intentionally enraging the comfortable, powerful locals in order to be invitational to the outsiders, the strangers, the Samaritans and the disenfranchised.  Obviously, this is the connection that I feel between (contemporary) liberal ideology and Christian thought.  That the ultimate tear in the fabric of the universe is: devotion to intentional poverty, intentional death, intentional weakness in order to PARTICIPATE in the incarnation of God.    So how’s that connected to the black sheep in all of us?   Lynn and I watched  urlLink Lost in Translation  this weekend.  I loved it – she was so-so.    urlLink     One thing that I loved was that – while the obvious meaning: that much important meaning gets “lost in translation” was great and true and particularly salient in this story – it was the third layer of that metaphor (lostness) that seemed most important and profound to me.   The second layer – that these particular characters were uniquely “lost” in a foreign culture – provided a great explanation of some of the freedom and happiness that they’re able to find in unexpected experiences.   But the third layer – that these particular characters were, at least on some level, powerful privileged people in the Great Economy of Being: A movie star, a jet-setting Yale Graduate.  Yet the experience of being lost in another culture had clarified for them both POWERFULLY how LOST they were in their own worlds, in their own lives, in between their hopes and their dreams.   And what I like about Jesus’ appropriation of Isaiah’s message is that he affirms the truth that:  in order to proclaim freedom and hope for the poor and oppressed – you have to be ready and willing to participate in the one-down position of being an ex-pat prophet.  You have to embrace the alienation that comes from returning to your hometown – and you have to announce and renounce the power structures and struggles that prop your home town up.    For me, I realized that I’m too often looking at the power structures wherever I am with the eye of a radical revolutionary looking to upend things – instead of recognizing and embracing the reality that the people inside of those power structures are just as poor and oppressed as anybody…only they don’t recognize those traits as definitive of themselves, because to do so would be (not only) counterintuitive and (also) counterproductive.  If I didn’t have a front burner I’d go on to make the next important leap which is …  And that’s why art is better than preaching (of any kind: religious, educational, political or scientific)…  peace (or a sword, whichever you need today)~

      this is the "here's what's happening" regular update -- target audience: people who care alot; lonely parasocial lurkers, beware.  tedious cataloguing of the mundane follows:  i'm enjoying my semester much more at malone this semester.  i'm teaching my two favorite classes (only), & having time to *almost* get all the work done that i'm supposed to...  i've got a couple of stories i'm scripting right now -- they're at the stage of newness that i can be purely excited about them still...  lynn is teaching a normal load & also partnering with the local urban school district in a number of ways.  the work she's doing is very rewarding and difficult -- trying to equip overworked, under-resourced teachers to develop literacy strategies for under-under-resourced student-populations.  one of the school districts has made some *huge* cuts in the past few weeks -- maybe more if a second levy is defeated this month.   that whole bleak reality has been saddening and disheartening...there were a few days that lynn de-celebrated as the: "death of idealism"...  we LOVE: our babysitting coop.  Our friends Jeff & Linda & Brian & Jenni have an arrangement which results in a date night two out of every three weekends and a housefull of two-through-four year olds every third weekend.  It feels like a really solid way to share life and invest in each other's vocations and families.  It's also really fun to have so many dates with the woman I love.  jaelyn's sick.  not that that accounts for most of who she is and is-becoming, but it certainly occupies a front-ish burner right now.  It's a recurring theme throughout the winter particularly....  Last night was a humdinger though.  Between Lynn and I together I'm sure we got eight hours of sleep.  Well.  Almost.  Vomit, not breathing through stuffy nose, fever, achy neck, sore throat...  BUT IN GENERAL ~ Jaelyn's delightful.  She loves to play imaginatively with little people, dolls & animals; she can do so for hours with her brother uninterrupted and unsupervised.  Okay for one half of an hour.  But given the (st/)age we're emerging from -- a half an hour feels like a lifetime...  She loves to care for sick, sad, or little people.  It seems to be a part of her that's pretty unique and just - her.  I admire that quality in her....  she really likes preschool & visits to the local YMCA --   as does ADDISON ~ who apparently deferred the terrible twos (because he was sweet, gentle, generous, kind, funny) until this week.  He's ornery this week.  In eastern-ohio-culture -- the personality trait of "orneriness" in children is celebrated -- particularly in male children (but occasionally a girl, too).  It's a part of the cultural milieu that i'm still puzzling about.   He loves cooking. Seriously.  Real or play cooking.  Trains.  Balls.  Stories about (as he calls them) ROARS.  (the most recent incarnation of said "roars" is a plea to include at least a guest appearance of Simba in any story you tell him...yes, i'm galled at the triumph of the disneyfication of the universe even in the lore of family and history...  we've been trying to sell our house for five months.   we want to move into a more diverse school district, a more urban environment & closer to work (eliminate a car) -- but we can't seem to sell our house.  we've been showing it more than once a week for the past three weeks, which is great right?  Wrong.  After 5 months, you're just resigned to the fact that whoever is looking at it is *not* going to put an offer on it.  So you punctuate your day with a mad dash home in the hour you have between classes and meetings and you once over the bathroom and swiffer the kitchen and stuff all the brightly colored plastic toys into the large, someone less cluttered looking, but also brightly colored rubbermaid containers.  it gets tiring.   But its one of our definitive rhythms right now.  a recurring motif.  i'm using the term "post-evangelical" to refer to my faith journey right now...and feel disheartened by most of mainline American Christendom -- particularly all of the ways it gets commodified, represented & politicized -- BUT curiously, in light of all that -- I really love the  urlLink church  we're going to now...   as always, i miss my friends, miss time with my friends, and enjoy most the few opportunities there seem to be in life for true communion...  peace~

          i will lay me down... in a bunker underground.... i won't let this happen to my children... meet the real world comin' out of your shell... with white elephants -- sittin' ducks i will -- -- rise up.    I have the quiet morning buzz of a cup of coffee and a bleak sky and i'm playing radiohead and feeling like the world is coming together, falling apart and i'm falling into the crevice no matter which direction its going.

      ............................................................... They Ask: What Have You Accomplished? ...............................................................   You sitting there.  Me sitting here.  Both of us paused in a freeze frame of respite (and reflection?).  I can tell that they have been asking you the wrong questions.  You have heard them because your ear is so well trained to the tones and the cadences they offer you.   These aren’t the things they say: (but they should:)  Have you been diligent and true with what you had?   Have you pushed a little farther than you thought you could?   Did you struggle to keep your eyes open even past the moment where  awake started bending at the edges into your dreams?  Did you defer the bathroom break just past the point of uncomfortable?  So you could get a little further? (not that it mattered in retrospect)  How many lines did you strikethrough your to-do list? (they ask.)  How many times has that list crucified you? (I counter.)  Do you ever lay under it at night like several feet of packed down soil?   Cold undisturbed soil?     When you look at what everyone else is getting done,  and you tell yourself that its more than you’ll ever manage to do….  When you feel like you’re trying to walk forward in chest-deep water, but the water’s thickening with every step…  When you feel like it would take an entire universe of energy, an impossible nother Big Bang for you to stand up out of that chair,  to push the sleep up and back and out of your eyes, to turn one more page, to make one more call, to get into your car one more time…  Because if they ever understood the true maths of it, they would understand that you didn’t start out with all of the opportunity, all of the resources, all of the possibility (like an undefiled and inviting whiteboard) that they had.   If they were  sensitive or observant, they could see, like I can that every little bit counts for something.  It’s the moving forward, not the finishing that’s worth comment.    "Finishing" is arbitrary, fictional and completely abstract.    Action?  That’s something worthwhile.    Size matters.    But only to them.  And they're blind to all but their own vision.

      i've been obsessed with flying for a good deal of my life.  i celebrate airplane takeoffs, drooling out the window, bowled over by the hubris of the whole exercise.  i dream fly frequently.  i've recently told Jaelyn and Addison the story of Icarus and they're intrigued too.  Tell it again, daddy!  (Are there negative consequences to telling your children incessant stories about mythical figures plunging down from the sky to a messy death in the ocean? )  In any case --  urlLink this site  made me glad.  More people should spend their time in productive ventures like this one.

      ............ express ............  i'm blogging from the express terminal at the library.   one would think that such restrictions might help such an over-expressor be a bit more succinct.  but maybe not, since i'm just in it for the experience.   what is it like to live in fast fifteen minute increments?   we sit in lines at fast-food to-go windows, we order out or order for delivery.    at school we learn the great classics in fifty minute time slots.   i just read about a playwriting contest that is for ONE PAGE plays.  music videos collapse the filmic tradition, popular music and marketing blitzes into a six minute visual poem that should express the breadth and depth of meaning and feeling in a song (and/or available on that artists album)  one minute dating allows people to have one minute conversations with a number of available and interested partners in a noisy restaurant room.   hot or not condenses the experience to an even quicker click of the mouse.   outside the window suvs and trucks and minivans zip by into the next fifteen minute increment of their worlds.   but the sunshine and the cedar trees and the unevenly faded red bricks of the Hoover Plant feel much less ephemeral.  They seem to be unphased by all the zipping and zapping.   Christian once commented on a blog that one of the best reasons to affiliate and jump into an institution's life -- and out of the chaos of liminality is because insittutions slow down the experience of time.   I'm intrigued.  Because the pop window that just warned me to save and exit (i have four minutes remaining) tick, tick, tick, is making me almost as nervous as the boundless energy of the two three year olds dancing around their mother next to me -- as she tries to move away from their insistence into a focused zone of choosing a book on kitchen rennovations.  tick, tick, tick.

You know there's something to be said for just being by one's self.   the advent of toddlers in our world has decreased the privacy of the loo -- but not gotten rid of it altogether.   strangely enough, i think that going to the bathroom  urlLink here  would be perfect.

      (a modified version of a talk i gave to the general faculty body yesterday)  Its Ash Wednesday.  A day when much of the Christian world chooses to wear a sign of humiliation and weakness upon our foreheads.    My friend Dave resigned from his job this past fall without knowing where he’d go.  He’s my age with a wife and family and a mortgage.     urlLink Ryan blogged about the discouraging dimensions of this stage in her life .  She’s a bright, talented, driven writer who is struggling to find a sense of vocation in the jobs available to her.      “Somewhere along the way I have lost this strong sense of self/identity that has always been a very prominent part of me. I have become really weak, which is hard for me to admit, because I am such a dominant person, but this is something I have had to face also.”   Dez’s dad has even worse frustrations with a job he’s poured his heart and his career into.   One of my cousins has all kinds of shit happening to her right now.  One of my  brother’s jobs is full of it, too.  As I drove home from work the other day,  I had a slow motion moment.  Do you have those?  Where something, for whatever reason, captures your attention and stands out?  Slows down the time you’re experiencing?   A dad and a little girl stood hand in hand poised and ready to cross 25th street.  The Malone Rush Hour Traffic kept pouring by, though.  I’m sure to her three year old eyes the crossing of that road seemed as wide as the Red Sea, or maybe as daunting as forty years in the Siani Desert.  For Dave, for Ryan, for Dez, my cousin, my brother, for the three year old girl ~ waiting.  Is hard. Being between is shitty.  I mentioned  urlLink Lubrano’s book LIMBO  before -- where he talks about the experience of growing up in a blue collar home and living in white collar middle class society.  He calls himself a “STRADDLER” someone with one foot in his blue collar heritage and the other in the occupation and social network of a white collar world.  And I know the idea of  liminality  isn’t a new concept for you blog readers – I write about it a bit on my  urlLink front burner site .  Anthropologist Victor Turner refers to this position of between-ness – as a LIMINAL state.  Limin simply means threshold.  When you’re in a threshold you’re neither in the hallway nor in the room.   No longer that, but not quite this either. Turner was intrigued by the possibilities of liminality.  Limin offers a unique opportunity to its inhabitants to transform themselves and it often allows the group who bestows the new status (job, promotion, graduation, membership, completion) the opportunity to clarify the standards of the community.  Are you already seeing how the college experience is one that’s full of liminal experiences?  At Malone  (my front burner employer), demographic data suggests that many of our students, as first generation college graduates, will emerge from college as “straddlers” – Lubrano writes ambivalently about this experience for him – “the academy renders you incomprehensible to the very people who formed you.”  But its not just students.  For all honest people, there are dimensions of our work and our families and our identity which we experience as being profoundly between.  Between that which we’ve come from, and that which we work toward.  On the other hand, one of the difficult parts of life is that for everyone who feels between – there are several people around her or him who are finding the world to be their oyster.  Josiah and Nathan won a debate tournament this weekend.  Dave decided on a job. My friend Garry wrapped a movie last week. Cliff finished a really great documentary film.  I got tenure.  Lynn’s big inservice at the downtown school district went really well.  The world feels underwritten by a big generous disco beat and flashing glorious rotating light bulbs.  It is fun for us to emerge into status, isn’t it?  To find a job, to find meaning in our job, when our friendships feel good and secure, to finally reach safely the other side of twenty fifth street. the finish line of a long race, a promotion, a graduating child, a completed campaign.  Crossing the Jordan.  Leaving behind the wilderness of temptation and wandering and fasting. It’s natural to  enter in to the celebration of completion and accomplishment.  But its less natural to want to enter into the shit.  But  Lent  is the season of the church year when we choose to go into the shit.  I hope you’re not hung up on the word.  I hope the severity of its ugliness just draws you into thinking about the exquisite complexities off its reality.    Shit is stinky and vulgar and mushy.  Until relatively recently in history it was pervasive (for many people and places, it still is).  You couldn’t separate yourself so easily and completely from the ugliness your body produces  with a quick flick of a silver lever.  Some of the tribes Turner studied in employed shit to mark the liminal beings.  It’s disgusting but true – they would smear themselves with it as costume, marker and protection (from the evil spirits).  Which reminds me that we shouldn’t forget the liminal nature of shit – the fertilizing capacity of our own waste…  In lent, we choose to enter this middle ground.  This difficult, ugly betweeness.  We choose to lay aside status, step away from stability, reduce our comfort.  We enter the wilderness, we don sackcloth.  We do not sate our appetites.   When we enter in to lent…we recognize the fullness of our own weakness and our dependence upon God’s mercy and grace.    In lent…we remember the depths of darkness that lie within our own histories and lives. The virtue of hopefulness & anticipation, become vital in that darkness.    In lent…we experience solidarity with the under-resourced, with the liminal, as a celebration of faith and reconciliation.  And maybe most of all – we participate in the Great Divine Gesture – we give up our riches to participate in the suffering of the world.  We choose to become less.  Like Jesus, we go – into the shit.  I know that there’s a rich diversity of faith tradition in the readership.  Whether you’re giving something up for lent or not – can I invite you to participate in the spirit of lent?   When you realize you are losing some control.  When you feel overwhelmed by the flow of tasks.  When you recognize that the light at the end of the tunnel is far away and getting dimmer.  Or when you miss desperately that thing you’ve chosen to abstain from.    Now. Here. In weakness, in humiliation, in darkness. Join in the Great Divine Gesture.

      which reminds me of the theory that my friend Greg used to have -- that there are two types of people in the world.  People who are skinny and sad and hungry and people who are -- happy fat.  and so -- happy fat -- became a kind of entelechial state.  something to admire, to aspire toward.    hope y'all are wolfing down your paczis today -- a last celebratory moment in the season of epiphany...  peace~

      I've been thinking a lot about the uses and meanings of  urlLink space  lately. (go and read -- its very good -- a bit of a kindred spirit)  the debate tournament happened in a place called the Philomathesian Lecture Hall at Kenyon College.  It felt like a pub, and britain and dead poets society and like the place where all the honorable white guys have been gathering for all these centuries to think collectively about how they're going to shape things.    so no wonder -- since they've been shaping things for so long -- no wonder that i like the way that space feels.    sometimes i feel like i have more of an emotional connection with wood.  but then i wonder if that's real or just conditioning.  most of my office is old metal surfaces and concrete block, cement floor with an industrial weave rug over it and (worst of all) ceiling tile.   Do you already know how i feel about ceiling tile?  but sometimes this space can be a little bit sacred.  mostly in moments when people are sitting in the yellow chair.    some of you know the yellow chair, others do not.  Here's a photo:    urlLink     Its been in my office ever since Grandma Erman's altzheimers forced her to give up her old house on the Erle Farm (century old log house, carefully covered and recovered in shiny white aluminium (please use british pronunciation on aluminium)).  My father in law, Garry and my brother in law Brian looked at me as if I were a space alien when I suggested that I wanted the chair, and no, they shouldn't throw it out...but its lent itself to brilliant creative brainstorming, honest confrontation, broken expressions of pain, and mostly -- laughter and mundane conversation.    I think that the yellow chair, when read as an icon, indicates that i live a fortunate life.  Sacred space in the profane world of concrete, steel and drop ceilings.  hope you find a yellow chair -- an airport where God can land in your day --   peace ~  (btw ~ if someone you know asks for prayer requests maybe you could mention the yellow chair. She's fallen on hard times, and I'm not sure if her springs are worth salvaging...any suggestions?)

      but there's never any new posts.  It's been like a week.    crazy!  i travelled to Kenyon College with the Debate Team this weekend and as i drove through the hills and curves of southeastern ohio i listened to local radio.  it's like a whole different world.  they're still playing the hits on the pop and country charts, but the rest of the programming sounds like a completely other universe than format radio in the city sounds.   There's none of the ethereal other worldly zooms or zaps or beeps.  No thunderously echoing DJ voices giving station promos between each ad and after each program.  The ads don't sound like they rolled out of New York and Nashville.  Instead, DJs chat with their call-in listeners for twenty minutes.  They chat about characters around town.  Old friends hijinks.  They laugh about ridiculous what-ifs.  They speculate about the high school basketball game in two nights.  The ads are read by the business owners and sound as raw as spoofs on Saturday Night Live.  The drive-time DJ makes guest appearances at Spitlers restaurant every weekend and broadcasts live from Fiedler's Ford every thursday morning.  He also calls the high school ball game, and intersperses his commentary with information about recent team injuries, family facts about the players and stories about how the two coaches got along when they were on the high school team together way back in the day.   Local radio reminds me of blogging.  The broadcasts seem idiosyncratic, quirky and unpredictable.  The cast of characters on many blogs is as expansive and unique as any one person's world.  But usually you can take comfort that no matter what happens in the lives of the DJs down at WTNS or WHBC -- the broadcast signal will not keep rolling.    So...I'll try to do better.  The plan is NOT to slack off on my backburner since i have tenure.  the *plan* is to slack off on my *frontburner* -- but I've got such a conscientious streak runnin through me...it's so hard to leave behind those habits...but that's a different blog.  peace out, faithful listeners~

      .......................... technology is sexy ..........................  what is meant by that word anyway? (sexy)  i'm reading:    urlLink     love the overall tone and direction of what she's saying -- i object to many of Ellul's critiques & Postman's logocentric thinking...  BUT she writes about the slippage of meaning in words and how they mask things more than they mean things--  she offers the example of the phrase "user friendly" -- it masks the meaning of friendship far more than it means  a machine which is easy to use.  but this word -- sexy.  could a word possibly slip farther from its origin of meaning.  and at the same time mean exactly the same thing as it always has.   i use it a lot. I call a lot of things "sexy."  i want to continually make people think about their bodies and desire and how their bodies and desire do and don't matter in the virtual world.   metaphors are like terrorist bombs in the hands of hyperbolists.

      .................. ..................  a while back i had a  urlLink post  where i talked about blogrolling and its connections to institutional life -- social movements -- etc...  bumped into a different metaphor today -- the idea that blogrolling is a kind of a  urlLink collecting game  -- makes great sense to me -- ties into my earlier analysis, and will intrigue a few of you, i'm thinking...

      ........................................  thinking about story... ........................................  I really enjoyed reading  urlLink this article  -- a story about "a newspaper's commitment to a Truth of Voices, to be set against the Truth of Numbers".  it seems like a lot of really important issues are being raised in this story --    epistemological questions  the primacy of narrative  the threats of metanarrative  the precarious dependence of democracy upon media institutions.   but, best of all, its pretty darn readable...

      ....................... The Psino .......................  I was never sure why I was a psino (silent p); if it was something i had done; something i should be embarrassed about or something that was generally true of everyone.    it was certainly true of everyone that was in my sunday school classes.   Jesus loves me, the psino, for the bible tells me so.   Perhaps "psino" was a theological term describing the comprehensiveness of original sin?  It was a ridiculously long time before I figured out my error.   this, I know.  and i thought of it this weekend when Jaelyn asked me and Lynn very insistently and repetitively:   "What is Cruisey - Violence?"  It took a lot of conversation to realize that this was her take on the crowds maelovelent chant in the JESUS film (which she's been watching) as they chant, "crucify him!"  She'd been walking around muttering the magical dangerous phrase "Cruisey Violence" all day.   peace~

      ......................................................................................................... a critique of birthday celebrations...and the possibility of unique selfhood .........................................................................................................  i turned 34 last week.  on the one hand, I agree with birthday critics.  birthdays should not be celebrated because they only signify the very dubious achievement of: --> congratulations!  you managed to stay alive.  those critics (with whom i partially agree) would advocate celebrating anniversaries, promotions, ordinations, graduations, achievements.  it seems like if we weren't so fixated on birthdays then we could devote a lot more time to celebrating the things people actually do, eh?   but alas, i do not *simply* agree with these critics -- because on the other hand -- aren't birthdays more than just celebrations of selfhood? aren't they actually a ritual which affirms the social world in which the individual exists and is embedded.  isn't it a mutual celebration of accomplishment?  where the community says, Hey! Look  who we managed to keep alive for another year!  Skylark gets a big honorable mention for celebrating my existence / our relationship in a limin-flavored way.  i was going to post some pictures of her vast array of limin flavored gifts -- but alas -- i'm having publishing photos right now.    it felt very overwhelming to be so remembered by a student.   students can often live toward their teachers as if they were simply teachers and less-so-people.  (not that i'm bitter about that!  isn't that what the system teaches us to do?!)  so within such a normative context -- her thoughtfulness was extraordinary.  And my parents and my brothers and sisters and my coworkers and my wife (all bringing very thoughtful gifts and words and presence) and even my daughter (who made about fifteen imaginary cakes for me for my birthday) and several very dear friends from far away who called.  The whole thing has the final effect not of drawing my attention to who i have been and who i might just grow to be (which would be what would happen if the birthday critics took over) but to who i am to these people and who they are to me.    And that feels richer and more rewarding than all the ideals of the truly free, truly enlightened liberal individual, eh?

      addison fandom .......................  my parents gave us this remake of the "Jesus" movie -- the one that missionaries cart all over the world to show in villages where we don't have time to learn about their cultures or languages or problems, but that probably need to say the sinners prayer sooner rather than later given the impending end times and all...  (but wait, i digress, apologies to my dispensationalist friends and family for my sarcasm...)  the jesus movie is *way* better than the other two videos that my parents have given me for my kids --  urlLink the cedarmont kids  &  urlLink Ms. Pattycake  (for these two gifts alone, i'm guessing that my parents will languish in Limbo for several years before they find the pearly gates -- who knew that there was anything worse than those dreadfully stepfordian Barney's children -- trust me the cedarmont kids are two levels of hell worse)...BUT....  Addison is obsesed with it.  Anytime there is a question about what we will do next -- where we will go next -- how we should pass our collective time?  His answer?  Let's watch the Jesus Movie.   We were sitting in a restaurant last night and he noticed that they were playing a radio in the background...his idea -- we should go home and bring the Jesus Movie and listen to that instead.   Hey Addison -- want to go outside and play?  Yeah, then we come in side, and eat and watch the Jesus movie.  Me: No, buddy, we've watched enough media this week...  Addison:  Then we go to sleep and wake up and THEN we watch the Jesus Movie.  Me: Add.  You've watched that movie enough.  Why don't we act it out together.   Addison:  we play Jesus movie, the dead part, (his other obsession -- along with Mel), THEN we watch the Jesus movie.   Me: Addison, we're not going to watch the Jesus movie right now.   His entire countenance falls into a mixture between enraged and despondent.   ADDISON: HOW we going to watch it?   Me: You mean, WHEN are we going to watch it?   ADDISON:  HOW we going to watch it?  We never EVER get to watch Jesus movie.  so you take that obsession and braid it with the cultural critics' obsession over the Passion -- and you have a very crucifixion centered lent....

      .............. weak ties ..............  the other day i was blogging about how my students are all always saying that:   things used to be better than they are now.   and...  today's youth [but fill in your favorite scapegoat] are going to hell in a handbasket.  I've been under the impression for a long time that nostalgia serves a *very* important and useful function -- it helps people to relocate themselves in the social milieu in a way that is not identity threatening.   but i've also been pretty damn sure that its a load of crock.  that in fact, things are not getting worse and worse...  (*not* that they're getting better and better, mind you.)  but i bumped into  urlLink this post  the other day where the idea of urban tribes and weak ties is Ethan Watters' way of responding to the kind of generational contempt that has been lavished upon the up-and-coming for as long as "youth" has been a commodified category in the market of media images...  He's suggesting that FRIENDS (*not* the show -- though they're a kind of an urban tribe with fewer-than-the average-number-of-weak-ties) account for milieu of political and social action that more traditional agencies and institutions used to....    These social networks are very hard to see. It's a type of "dark matter": a force that's hard to see but that holds everything together. But they can make a difference: A web of weak acquaintances resulted in the toppling of the Berlin Wall.     ....weak ties.....  i love this stuff...  weak ties -- from what i gather here (not enough to know yet)  -- Watters is affirming the idea of weak ties in the way that Weick affirms the value of "loose coupling" -- that there is a unique (even emergent) kind of power/resource/ability -- that pools in these kinds of connections, but it's a kind of an inverse power....  ...and he goes on to write that we're lacking enough substantial narrative to explain that new way-of-being-in-the-world to ourselves...  i haven't read the book, but i'm intrigued.  i think if you've ever thought:    hmm friends today are what family was fifty years ago for people....   you may enjoy this interview.  peace~

      ................................ Truth is overrated ................................  (the following are characters based loosely upon an actual conversation)  Joe: We're gonna win it all. We're gonna get to the tournament and win everything.  [silence on the van.]  Joe: Well?  Andrew ?  Whaddya think?   Andrew: I think you've got two of the three principal virtues going on -- faith and hope -- so that seems good.  Ryan: do you really believe that those are the three principal virtues?   Andrew:  Um. They're Pauline.  The church affirms them.  That's my tradition.  I guess so.  Ryan:  Well it just  seems like there might be other virtues.   Andrew stares out the van window at the passing cornfields.  Lots of passing cornfields.  It's Ohio after all.  Ryan interrupts his reverie.  Ryan: What about truth?  Shouldn't that be one of the virtues.   Loud anthem-like Rock music fades up in Andrew's head.  YEAH, that's the point, Ryan, he thinks.  Truth is overrated.    It's not a commandment.  It's not a fruit of the spirit.  It's not one of the three principal virtues.   Ryan:  Or integrity.  Shouldn't that be in there.   Exactly, Ryan.  Integrity must be understood in the shape of LOVE faith hope patience gentleness humility LOVE.    truth is contextual, relational and communal.  And THAT truth is underrated, i'm thinking.

      ....... phth .......  the great thing about that word is that you can say it longer than almost any other word with consonants.    give it a try.   and for those  of you who don't know what phth is -- it's the feeling on your skin procured when rubbing cordury,  velour, velvet, etc...  while velvet is high culture, velour -- low, they have been related by the larger family of how my brother daniel experiences them.   i, unlike my brother, like phth.  jaelyn, like me, except more, LOVES phth.  (she has a bit of a heightened sense of texture, though.  She won't hug me when I'm wearing wool sweaters and sport coats.  occasionally, randomly, she'll disappear upstairs and bring me down an alternate sweater.  Not at my bidding, mind you.  Before i even remember how offended she is by wool -- scratch wool, particularly.  I wonder if someone has heightened texture awareness as part of one's DNA code or whether it can be socialized.  If its the later, Summer Barry is to blame -- she used to take McKenzie to fabric stores to close her eyes and feel the difference in the fabrics. Of course I was hooked -- seemed like a good way to develop the mystic sensibiliity -- so off went Jaelyn and I to the fabric store.)  daniel, abhors phth.   I have to agree with him in the rare case that anything in the phth family touches the skin that my freshly clipped fingernails reveal.  Yesterday I walked outside, overcast, warm, drizzly, and I said this day feels like Phth to me.  I'm thinking that not enough people embrace moderate weather.  there's always a flurry of conversation around "sunshine."  Well what's so great about sunshine? I think its a little too, too.  Like Jim Carrey's "acting."  (which I hear is completely non-stylized in Eternal Sunshine -- which I can't wait to see this weekend, and already recommend based on the praises and critiques I've heard)  Let's hear it for the Grey!  Let's hear it for the Rainy!  Let's offer a gentle round of applause for the gentle patter of drizzle outside.  The water is almost invisible, almost not there, but there, still.    Being a pisces, i'll plunge into any opportunity to move through water...no matter how thick or coherent it is.   And the more I think about it -- the more I think -- YEAH.  That underwater sequence in The Graduate -- and then sampled in so many other great movies (particularly, laudably, Rushmore) is all about phth.  and grey days.  and beethoven's moonlight sonata -- played  ppp .  my brothers are over on the  urlLink Faces of Dave  arguing about whether God knows everything or loves completely.    I prefer grey days.

      ........................... scrolling headlines ...........................  this weekend the family quarantined ourselves into the house all weekend.  Lynn had some kind of debilitating illness on Friday night and healed slowly and gradually across the weekend.  Our limited range of motion made for a slower pace of life and more centered feeling in general.   i think my life has been so defined by workaholism and frenzied action that i feel guilty when my life is moving at a pace that i can almost keep up with.    i've said to a few people -- and should have (if I didn't) say it here -- that last semester, I felt like the question every day was not "would i disappoint someone today?"  it was -- "who would feel betrayed by me? and how egregious would that betrayal feel?"  I know I'm still a bit disappointing this semester, but less so.  besides, i've got to at least *seem* human so that people don't feel too overwhelmed by me...  .....................  Jaelyn is transitioning from "good nights" to all-night-sleeping-with-panties.  This means that I'm waking up once or twice a night to carry her into the bathroom, helping her onto the toilet and then cuddling her back into the warmth of her bed.    There's something overwhelmingly beautiful and wonderful about the whole thing.    It seems like all aspects of waste production / removal / management. Should be the most awful part of parenting.  But I think that right now -- with Jae turning into such a little girl -- shedding all the last vestiges of baby-hood -- that fragility is dear.  I feel the timeless ache which binds me backward into the fabric of her being during these midnight forays.  This person! (I feel in the darkness of the bathroom) I am bound to this person forever, by love!!  She's almost too heavy to carry easily now, but the weight of her body and the way she burrows a cuddle into my shoulder as I stumble back toward her room, makes me feel like the very quiet smile of the universe is shaped exactly like the short walk from the bathroom to the bedroom in this creaky, beautiful old house.  ........................  i watched the news last night.    Is it true that there are people who still conflate the "War on Terrorism" with the "War on Iraq?"  This blog is mostly not a political diatribe, but last night I heard a soldier's family saying that he died in the "war on terrorism."  He was a victim of mortar fire in Iraq.  I am pained and saddened by all of the deaths in Iraq...  I am enraged though, that our president has chosen to name the problem with terrorism with a rhetorical move "War on..." which annoints more violence in response to violence.  Are the limitations of our language / our culture?  So rooted in a notion of us / them that we can only imagine the flourishing of democracy premised upon a jihad of our own.    Ugh.  ..............................  snow - sun - snow - sun - rain - snow - sun - rain - sun.   This morning it is sun, but the weather, these days, has multiple personality disorder.  ..............................  Christian said in the early days of the backburner that he admired my choice to have one blog to deal with family / friends / politics / work / ideas / theory.   Well, Christian, maybe you didn't quite say *all* of that.   So anyway, lately I've been feeling the tension of multiple audiences / diverse friends / complicated identity / multiple - back - burner - interests.  And these tensions all exist in my life world -- but it feels odd to have feelings re-performed in the act of publication.  .............................  I finished three ten minute plays in the last two weeks.  I'm going to host a reading at my house soon to try to "workshop" them.    I love these shorter forms of publication, but long to have FINISHED a play or a movie of more length / substance / gravity.  .............................  i'm obsessed with the sauces in indian food right now.    .............................  great _alias_ episode, last night, eh?  i'm of the strong opinion that J.J. Abrams had to spend the first half of the season reconstructing a new rock and hard place within which he could employ the formula we know and love so well.  ~peace...

      ………………………………………….. At the Humana Festival for New Plays …………………………………………..   I woke up this morning with sunlight on my face.  I opened my eyes and could see across the Ohio River to Indiana, the state where I was borne.  There’s a big steel clock on top of what looks to be the long brick manufacturing plant for COLGATE.  Ironically, I had to borrow toothpaste from the front desk.    The bridge which emanates from almost just below my window has intermittent steel peaks that punctuate its otherwise square architecture.    I couldn’t really see the peaks when the bridge was outlined in green lights last night.  I see the peaks now in the severe shadow it casts next to it on the grey green water of the river below.    If you train your eye to just focus on the the line of the bridge and the line of the shadow particularly where  they meet…They form the perfect figure of an eye – so gigantic that it could only be the reflection of God checking out the spring morning in Louisville.  I saw my first of 9 (maybe 10!)  urlLink plays  last night –  urlLink Sans Culottes in the Promised Land .  It was a very solid, profound, aching funny play about the “promised land” of America and the ways that that promise gets played out for black women.   One of the characters was a 10 year old African American girl who was the only person of color in her riding class, her ballet class, her private school.  She was obsessed with Disney heroines and over the course of the play transformed herself into (literally) Snow White.  Ouch.  I listened to a bunch of Mars Hill tapes that Matt let me borrow.  I because more deeply convinced of how important it is that mainstream Christianity be exposed to the ways that Social Constructionist / PoMo thinking meshes with Christianity.  The tyranny of Natural Law thinking,  Platonic ideals & Allen-Bloom-like-devotion-to-High-Culture sometimes make me feel claustrophobic…  …But the freedom to think and listen and drive en route (!)  …The Persian food I had for dinner last night(!)  …the prospect of three plays this afternoon (!)  It’s funny how I feel a little bit guilty about blogging from the place of delight.  (as if the very nature of blogging belongs to the world of mundanity – to the quotidian)  But I know that the delight of the weekend is only as sweet as it is because it is bounded on both sides by a return to my world.   Hope a little of delight surprises you whether you're a weary sojourner, in a hospital in florida, or juggling children, house-showings & a speaking engagement....  Peace~

      ……………………………………………………… is “community” a mask for ugly oppression? ………………………………………………………  One of my favorite students said to me the other day, you know X class hasn’t really turned out to be a community of learning. People are all just doing their thing as usual.  I was at Home Group last Sunday night and we were wrestling with the controversy from Hebrews 6:6 and one of the insights that my wife keeps feeding back into our talk about Hebrews is – to think about the ways in which any writer addressing Jews must be thinking of the problem of the individual and the community.  Steve suggested that in many ways Jesus, his teaching, and the teachings that radiated out from Him were probably fairly radically individualistic for that time and place.  And I think that both of them were pointing out that people (like us) who live in a radically individualistic society really struggle to figure out the hermeneutic wriggle we must do in order to apply such passages to our life.  If you live in a world where faith is so collective that you struggle to have a sense of personal agency (and piety) then Hebrews (and other scriptures) make perfect sense – but when you live in a world so jagged with individualism, how do you read the salve of “community” into passages written to the collectivist world?  We came up with some decent answers, but I did get stuck on the question a little bit.  I’ve noticed that Community has become a kind of ideological battleground.  People from the right and left in almost every setting are vying for it – and I’m not just talking about governmental politics now.    At the little evangelical school where I teach, the fundamentalists (who currently control Student Life) have a term called the "community agreement."  Rhetoric which COULD BE a helpful way to get students to own their own role in taking responsibility for their own actions as well as the actions of others.  A way to figure out that we are all our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers.   Ironically, instead it’s actually a cloaking device by which an increasingly Byzantine set of rules and regulations is enacted and perpetrated by an incredibly centralized oversight mechanism.  The term is also used well (read: in ways that resonate with my experience).  Romanowski uses it as one of the key challenging points for contemporary media mythology.  I participated in a group (at work again) called a learning cluster – part of a larger national (and beyond?) movement toward learning – in – community.  The same favorite student told me that he had experienced a sense of community amongst filmmakers on campus....  I feel embedded in community these days.  There are several axes around which these social networks form.  But I also feel keenly the precariousness of all of them.  Set adrift from the assumption that anyone will live for their whole life in just one place.  That language patterns, family systems, land or work set few constraints on our mobility.  Aware that some of the patterns of interaction in these groups are just being initiated and realized.  Aware that other patterns have reached a pattern of rigidity which threatens some of the members.    I wonder if there is sometimes a temptation to confuse community with the feeling of social support?  Or the experience of celebration? A sense of shared aesthetics?    What * is * essential to community?    Here’s my start:   Continuity  (Balancing) Coherence   (and) Diversity  Relationship  Tradition  Movement  Shared Experience  (somewhat) shared vision (which is a kind of coherence)  (partially) shared past (a kind of continuity + tradition)  Elements of community that I'm suspicious of: (and please feel free to deconsruct my suspicion)  intimacy (i'm not suspicious of it qua it -- i'm suspicious of it as an assumption and prerequisite for community -- since it seems most likely to emerge within homogenous, mutually satisficatory relationships...)  stability (b/c it seems like communities that over-fixate on finality -- tend to become rigid more quickly and maybe even get confused about whether they've arrived at their destination long before they should...(?) i'm reflecting my derridean tendency toward the endless deflection of final meaning....)  impermeability (both from within and without -- i *know* that this is a reflection of my individualism -- but i just get so stuck on the PROBLEMS of small communities which are non-integrative (both abstractly and in terms of their members)...)  Is there an irony in Me (one voice, one man) announcing autonomously what community is?    There would be if it weren’t an invitation…. Your thoughts?  sorry to be so long winded....  i'm off to see a bunch of plays at the Actors Theater.  It's a birthday weekend.  Thanks, Lynn!  ~peace

      ................................ when we were young ................................  erik and i used to sit around strumming our A chords, our G chords and our C chords til there was nothing left of our fingers.  We talked of faith and politics and work and relationships.  marcaus let me drive his vehicle around a roundabout and several other areas of Melbourne.  We talked and laughed and prayed and mugged.  david and i discovered the shock of email together, chatting in computer labs seven hours apart, shocked by what the world used to be and could never be again.  revelling in our rudd-ness, parsing the world with our gigantic intellects.  when i first knew my students, Skylark thought "feminist" was a four letter word, Bemis threw her shoe or her notebook at me (I forget), Mandy listened and cocked her head to the side and seemed both baffled and intrigued.   ....and look, this set of blogs is like a fabric with patches from all of them woven in....  i know such nostalgia, such gee-whiz-aint-that-internet-somethin is neither hip nor  erudite --  but I just wanted to say thanks to all of the aforementioned for stopping into the blog.  I *love* the timbre of your voices in my life...  ~peace

      ......................................... intergenerational acceptance .........................................  when my wife was growing up her family used to hide their VCR everytime Grandma came up the drive.  VCRs were an unreasonably extravagant luxury; she would not have approved at all.  my grandmother sent me a letter the first time she saw in a picture that I had grown a ponytail.  She wrote: "So and So asked, 'does Andy have a ponytail?' I said no, that must be some shrubbery."  My cousins referred to my ponytail as shrubbery ever since.   My Grandfather slipped a little handwritten clip of paper into the same envelope. He wasn't the writing sort; as far as I knew the last letters he had written were to his mother when he was in the military in WW II.  The clip of paper read:   "1 Corinthians 11:14 - Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"   That's all.  No personal note.  No context.  Judgement had been rendered and imparted.   It seems like a telling anecdote because it condenses all that I wonder and fear about growing old....  My father in law once told my wife that her mother thought I was drinking too much.  (we were in France -- where its actually a sin if you *don't* drink too much).  A different day, my father suggested that perhaps i shouldn't tell my mother about my drinking.  (and for the uninitiated, this is *not* a drinking problem -- this is a divergence from the fundamentalist position of teetotalling...)  and last night i was feeling sad about having to monitor myself when talking to my Grandmother.  I know that this is a universal practice -- code-switching for Grandma's, but there comes a point where you just think -- at what point along the playing of a part, the monitoring of selves, the secrets that underlie relationships -- do you cease to really know one another?  it's a seam that i'm endlessly curious about -- and not in a dispassionate way?   It makes me feel sad, I said to Lynn as I turned out the headboard light.  That's its such a fact of existence.  Isn't there anyone anywhere who can just love across difference?  who can know fully and still love completely?   It seems least possible, least likely across generations --  is this what *keeps* generational chasms wide? even after the aesthetic differences of adolescence and the battles surrounding of coming of age have faded from importance...?  ~?

      the sun is fiercely trying and only barely succeeding at warming the day, but if i just stare out my office window -- the blue sky makes me happy.   maybe we're all getting that sun - deprivation disease.  as a species, you know, humans. everybody. or maybe it just happens when we get old. which, i know, i am getting.  ...............  what makes me happy right now:   1. reading plays.  writing plays.   2. sunshine.  3. leaving work.   4. staying home.  5. walks in the chilly air.  6.  the hmmmm of airplanes flying over and that rush of -- "i'm going somewhere" adreniline in my stomach.  even though i'm not really going anywhere.  7.  sam smith beers.  8.  the whistling song in Kill Bill 1.  9. afternoons at Harry and Laurie's  10.  Listening to Lynn tell stories or talk to big groups of people when she's excited.  11.  jaelyn's smile.  12. addison's protesting, "but how we Ever, Ever going to ...(fill in the blank here)."  13. the house on 23rd street.  no, really, its just the enormous hope and possibility of the house on 23rd street.  .....................  what doesn't make me happy right now:   1. the fact that every time I glance up at the sunshine above my desk, more papers copulate and have babies and the piles get thicker and messier.  longer to-do lists.  2. you can never go home.  ..............  what else makes me happy:   the increasing prevalence of orange in our culture.  i'll be sad when this phase is over.  the birth of malachi  keegan (sp?) to my friends...  .........  when i first had (both of my) babies.  i lay awake with them in a bassinet next to my bed listening for their breath. its hard to hear baby breath.  i thought.  maybe i'll never sleep again.  but if i can keep this baby alive...it'll be worth it.  how will i ever keep this ridiculously fragile baby alive?   .........  other things that make me happy.  1. small boxes.  2. coffee.   ................  what's great about wes anderson movies?   - the characters are horribly depraved and the relationships are so completely broken, but there's so much hope.  so much love.    ...............  maybe shutting up every once in a while on your blog makes people stop checking. and you can stop thinking about who you're righting for and start writing for yourself again.  maybe.  ...............  peace~   (and love and hope.)

      . spirituality .  "According to the Franciscan priest Richard Rohr, spirituality is not for people who are trying to avoid hell; it is for people who have been through hell. In many ways, spirituality is about what we do with our pain. And the truth is, if we don't transform it, we will transmit it." - Al Gustafson   thanks to  urlLink bob .  who i don't know, but appreciate just now.

      Early this morning (6;30ish a.m.)Jaelyn woke up.  The following is her co-authored account of the events leading up to her early rise:   Jaelyn dreamed that when she was little and she was playing in a big dollhouse with Emily Livermore – they were playing INSIDE the dollhouse, and all of the sudden, there were big scary things outside of the dollhouse.  And all of the sudden, Daddy came up to the dollhouse and he was kind of scary because  his hands had turned RED like a monster.  So she woke up and called for her Dadddy.  Who came running up the stairs, and she burrowed out of her big yellow quilt and threw her arm backwards and up over the neck of her Daddy and pulled him close.    The End.

      ........................... chick publications ...........................  do you know about  urlLink chick tracks ?  my grandmother used to leave them everywhere, so, if you've read them, there's a good chance that you read one of the ones she left laying in restaurants, public restrooms and phone booths.    bemis loves to drop them off in the office, knowing that i collect artifacts of incredible "christian" kitsch.   She dropped off  urlLink Trust Me  yesterday.  The first three pages crack me up.  (and i don't mean *crack* in *that* way)   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     i don't mean to give away the ending or anything here, but the kid gets hooked, sells drugs, goes to jail, gets raped, gets aids, dies.  Seriously.    but what cracks me up is the depiction of the underworld that sucks this kid in.    what draws this kid to this unlikely group of friends, drawn from the cast of an MTV reality show?   it convinces me that the audience that this book is *really* supposed to hit -- is the kids Grandma.  Who sees her good little kid being sucked in by "the wrong crowd."  and of course its supposed to reinforce all of her ideas about who the wrong crowd is, what they do, and what the destiny of her good little grandkid will be.  My grandmother used to take great delight -- secret-agent-identity-delight -- in covertly leaving these books everywhere.  It added a great deal of drama.  Of course she also passed them out by hand to everyone she met.    My grandmother was a bright, educated thoughtful person.  She read the classics, knew great art, had impeccable taste.  So why jack chick?   Fundamentalism baffles me more the further I get from it.  Which, I suppose, is the point.

      . kill bill (spoiler: don't read) .  at the beginning of the movie, Uma / Beatrix says -- I'm going to kill Bill.   throughout the whole movie (and i'm referring to both as one, because that's what they should've been/are -- though i probably wouldn't  have gone to see a 4.5 hour movie), she works toward the opportunity to kill Bill.  (although it gets less clear about how/why she had to kill the entire Deadly Viper Assasin Squad in order to get to Bill.  Why didn't she just start with him?)  In the previews she says, you bet i'm going to kill bill.   so how!? how?! how in the world -- does the major dramatic question which continues to keep us interested manage to be: will beatrix kill bill?   it seems a little bit brilliant.

      .................................................................. my grand theory of the universe is falsifiable. ..................................................................  which, i guess, according to my training, makes it a good theory. if grand theories of the universe can ever be good theories.    so what is my g.t.o.t.u.?   i've already shared it here a couple of times, but i've honed the wording a little bit.  i'm still waiting for the stream of comments to barrage me with reasons it isn't true or instances where it isn't true, but so far nothing.  here it is:    People make most of their decisions because they believe their choices will salve their greatest wounds.    that's it.   it's a theory of human motivation. which seems essential to any of us who ever want to inspire / persuade / understand / study / enlighten / enliven / liberate / titilate / entertain / educate other people. right? can't do any of those without understanding motivation.  but i was saying that i discovered its falsifiability.   children.   i know that i'm constantly blogging about my children which makes me categorically unhip.  parenting just reeks of anti-cool, but....  i gotta say...  children don't have to live in response to their greatest wounds, because their greatest wounds haven't emerged yet.  They're able to live much more in the immediate present.  I already sense that Jaelyn is developing a sense of how the world responds to her -- and embedded in that sense (for all of us) is an understanding of the world's limitations, betrayals and cruelties:  the incipient wounds which will scar us throughout our development....  but its nice that they're not poured in concrete yet.   i have a related question, too.  is a person's level-of-reflectiveness affect how aware they are of their wounds (and therefore how stable their wounds are)?  peace~

      ............................ teaching/friendship ............................  my brother  urlLink the bishop has a thread about who teachers should teach to  -- the "get it"s or the swine.  i think if the choice is to be made (?) the swine have it in the Kingdom of Heaven....  but i've been thinking a lot recently about some of the costs of teaching -- but its really not just about teaching -- its more about mentorship / discipleship / person-development.  whatever...  that process of investing yourself into someone who you have hope for.    so i've just been reviewing some of the complications of that paradigm for living.  implications that maybe i couldn't see while i was still living like a gypsy -- but feel more and more valid the longer i live as a farmer:  1. when you invest in relationship -- you end up caring about that person in ways that are not always shared.  this tension is particularly keen if the mentee / student/ disciple sees your relationship more as a process of the institution / body / community that you've been formally matched by.  2. when you've become friends inside the institution -- staying friends outside of the insitution demands a different set of expectations.   this is almost the flipside.  some of my most rewarding relationships with students from malone are those with alumni.  however -- as soon as the person leaves the context that's afforded us the opportunity to develop relationship -- our continuing relationship has to fit into the fabric of my "non-work" life.  3. when you choose to go about your teaching / discipling / mentoring with the people you work with -- those relationships end up spilling over into your "non-work" life.  so that the concrete choices that you make about each day / each hour -- end up affecting your family, your "non-work" friends (as if it were possible to have those!), and then all the other family and friend relationships you have far away.   am i complaining?  no!  clearly, a profession that allows me to be relational in meaningful ways is one of the luckiest gifts in the universe --   but feeling the strain of these tensions lately has alerted me to this (newly discovered by me) domain of institution / identity strain.    the rigidity of institutional life is much to blame here.  people's default assumptions about time and relationship are structured not only on genuine need and desire , but also based on the structures of time and space that the institutional clock provides.  its this clash that makes for a tension between the-way-it-is and the-way-it-ought-to-be....  hope your day is filled with flashes of the-way-it-ought-to-be....  peace~

       Sisyphus - A cruel king of Corinth condemned forever to roll a huge stone up a hill in Hades only to have it roll down again on nearing the top. The American Heritage Dictionary     we're redoing the kitchen floor in response to all the potential buyers who can't see through to the possibility of redoing their own floor.  so today josiah and i were unhooking the water line into the frig and we just COULDN'T get the bolt to turn and when we thought we were, it was just turning below too.    And suddenly with a flash of clarity i realized that we were not operating under the simple limits a particular bolt gone bad.  this was the entelechy of our universe.  i knew when we went ahead with the water-bearing-refrigerator-door that we were inviting the anger of the pantheon, but suddenly i realized that my mythic existence had already come full circle.   "Sisyphus had it easy compared to us," I mourned, "at least he could see that the rock was about to roll back down again."   "Can you give me a hand down here?" Josiah interrupts...  "We don't even know if we're pushing the rock up or watching it roll back down.  We're not even cognizant of our futility.  The universe has gotten so small, that no tool, no fire, no deus ex machina could ever rescue us now.  We just fiddle a little bit to the left and right."  In moments like these, I want to write science fiction, but then i remember that that means i'd have to *read* and *watch* science fiction, so i decide, enh...  ...i'll blog about my futility....  may the tedium of the quotidian swallow you blissfully whole and unaware, rendering your world full of....  ~peace

      one of my brothers is being hunted in a good'ol salem-style witch hunt.   one of the hunters sneaked onto his  urlLink blog  and tried to use my brother's humour as  proof that daniel is, indeed, a witch.    (i only wish he would have come to me first, as i have much more interesting proof -- for instance the one evening at our family cottage when daniel levitated while humming latin phrases so ancient, that even my father, who was high school latin king at Soo High Blue Devils (ahem, see?) - Go Devils!, couldn't translate it.  once daniel started spinning on the ceiling he got sent straight to bed.)  so anyway.  Daniel is forced, on his blog, to say some straightup stuff to any other potential witch hunters, and he writes:    You may find what you are looking for, but it won't be a satisfying as you think it will.    i love this. the idea that work done out of vengeance and revenge and malevolence of any kind -- yields nothing but more of the same.  it seems like the yang principle to the yin i promised in my title.   it's in a little prayer that i read in playwriting -- ascribed to Ray Bradbury --    Remind us to know that the more we create out of love of an idea, the better our work, our lives, our influence, becomes.   Tammie, my friend who i work with, gave a talk three(?) four(?) years ago where she said this more pointedly about the work that we're (hopefully?  mostly?) up to in our academic department...(i can't quote -- but i'll summarize)  Work done out of love brings us joy, makes us whole, gives us meaning, gives us LIFE.  That's the kind of work we try to do here (in the theater).  Not work done out of fear.  That kind of work just brings DEATH.   So much of the work of the world is done out of fear....  (BTW ~ thanks to my friend Clifford for passing the Bradbury prayer on to me (read whole thing in the comments).  His  urlLink film  finds its  urlLink first big audience  tomorrow morning & is a great example of work done out of love...)

      my dad is the greatest dad.     urlLink     1. he's a virtuosic public speaker.    but not the kind of virtuosity that makes you (the audience) walk away feeling like -- WOW, he knows everything and i learned one thing.    but instead the kind of virtuosity that looks like -- WOW, i care so much more about that issue now! and i understand the fundamental questions at stake.  2. he's the kind of dad who never made his virtuosity an excuse for being a better or worse father.    in other words, for most of my childhood i grew up with a profound sense that who my dad was as a preacher was largely unrelated to who he was as a father.  the people who lived around me contradicted that notion, but the strongest influence was always my dad -- who was always most interested in me and our relationship and our family's relationship first / foremost / and regardless of his professional career.  3. my dad prepared me well for the world.    He taught me how to:   chop down a tree -- chainsaw or axe,  tie a boat to a dock,  shoot a gun,  blaze a trail,  clear a trail,  navigate the woods,  catch a ball,  throw a ball,  hit a ball,  run (or walk) a distance,  how to try uncomfortable things,  how to persist in the face of great sorrow,  how to change the oil,  frame in a wall,  hook up basic electric,  fix my plumbing,  carry my books by my side not in front,  act like a gentleman -- hold open doors,  end any song by ascending up the keyboard on 1-5, 3-5, 1-5, 3-1, 3-5, 3-1, etc. (of whatever your resolving chord is) introduce anyone to anyone else in a social situation,  how to cook eggs and french toast,  how to study both sides of everything,  how to listen,  how to grow with grace,  how to act in institutions (politically, expediently, yet with integrity).    But he also taught me BIGGER things like --  getting burned by someone who you choose to extend grace to is better than not extending grace.   And -- "if you want to find Ed Rudd (*read: the best you can be) find the darkest dirtiest hole where no one else wants to be, and you'll find Ed Rudd* shoveling in the bottom of that hole."   And -- that faithfulness means making fifteen sandwiches every morning before school for your kids and always being vigorous about proclaiming the most beautiful features of the woman you love  and sitting in a very cramped nursing home corner learning the habit of birdwatching just to recover some of the beauty that your confined father can no longer walk toward.  4. My dad cares about me.    In college he wrote me a letter every single day.  Seriously.  Every day.   At least once a month my WHOLE LIFE he took me to a long breakfast and listened and talked and cared about everything I said.  Everytime we talk he tells me how much he loves me and how proud he is of me.  Every horrible day of high school.  Sitting alone at a table I would open my paper bag and pull out a napkin that said "We are SOOOO proud of you son..." and on many of those days the napkin would name a specific thing they were proud of.  5. My dad wants to have a relationship with me as an adult.    That's uncommon.  I know it from my friends, and I'm incredibly grateful for it.  on May 6. each year we celebrate his birthday --  but its his life that I celebrate.  I feel grateful and fortunate for being the lucky guy who happened to get assigned this dad.    Happy Birthday, Dad!

      words of the day. ............................  he had convinced himself that his increasing  urlLink embonpoint  would be welcomed by the committee when they met again next year.  That they would find such news startling, yes, perhaps, but also heartening.    We must all needs become more substantial at some time or another, musn't we?   We shan't be able to truly make any impact anywhere if we're light enough for a breeze to blow us away.    Speed is one thing.  That is true.  Speed is a virtue that should not be poo-poo-ed by anyone. But ultimately? Really?  It can't be a core virtue.  Can it?  Nor can  change  for that matter.  Right?  Nor  innovation ?  and of course not  revolution ... They're all dependent upon the status quo.  Status quo is the thing.  And what is status quo if its not GIRTH?  If its not substance?  if its not presence?    He looked at himself in the mirror from the side.  Gravitas.  Significance.  There were all sorts of clear arguments  marking out how this change was Growth.  Development.  Evolution.  He had bought all new suits across the past two years.  Increasing waist sizes, its true, are disheartening for almost everyone.  But he focused upon the fine thread of the suits.  The flattering cut.  The tailoring of the fit.  None of these could have been possible back when he was his old self.   The self the committee had chosen initially was good for them and good for him then.  When speed was what they needed.  But now they needed something else.  He had convinced himself.  (he nodded in the mirror to affirm that it was all true.  it is all true isn't it?)

      . virtues and vices .  the new blogger user interface asked me if, because i push snooze on my alarm clock, i was lazy. nope. i typed.  just tired.   and if i were to go into it -- i'd go so far as to say that its much more of a symbol of my ambition in tension with my finitude.    it is my ambition that drives me to set my alarm clock to 5 or 5:30 every morning -- mostly so i can have writing time.  it is my exhaustion that often motivates me to take a few minutes of rest before i attack the day.   so laziness isn't my vice -- nor is ambition my virtue.   i'm quite confident, though that *distraction* is my vice -- is well roundedness the accompanying virtue?   ambition + distraction is the equivalent of a driverless vehicle careening forward on a full tank of gas.   peace~

      . a near miss conversion on drop ceilings .  grading is done -- all turned in.   i'm still 200 emails behind.  weather is finally beautiful consistently.  office is such a disaster that i (literally) can't open the door to get in.  jaelyn has strep throat (again!).  graduation was filled with happy / odd endings with many student/friends.  i'm writing a play about superheroes and lumberjacks.  Sort of.  Lynn and I are both teaching Summer One Session -- so til June 10 or something like that.  its only one class each which seems much more manageable.    finished the kitchen floor, too, for those of you who have a better ability to keep up on such details...its much more squishy beneath our feet.    i've been a strict opponent against linoleum for as long as i can remember -- along with wood paneling, drop ceilings, and formica countertops.  now that i know how cushy this rolled vinyl is -- i'm thinking that i should give up all my elitist preconceptions regarding natural vs. synthetic surfaces -- tammie challenged me yesterday on my non-formica stance anyway -- she said as someone who has a moniker of retrorudd *really* should give formica the time of day.  so maybe i should embrace the simulacra...enter more fully the swirl of popcult...  it really is the drop ceilings that is holding me back.  They just feel like a crime against hope.  always squishing us down -- making us feel like we should live in low slung spaces....

       urlLink     Have you met my mom?  You don’t have to stop and think about the answer to that question.  If you’ve met her she’s unforgettable. If you haven’t….well then, I guess you’re just marking time until you do…   My mom is motivated by what’s to come.   In all the time that I’ve known her, most days she would remind us that what we’re doing matters MOSTLY based on how it builds God’s Kingdom.  And she lives that reality very concretely.  She chooses to pay attention to people who aren’t gratifying to know.    Have you ever had a conversation with someone and you’re thinking in your head -- while you’re being polite and nodding – will this person ever realize how long they’re droning on?  And have they ever asked anyone a personal question? Or listened for just a minute? Or do they spend their whole life obsessing (in longwinded ways) about themselves?    The answer to these questions in your head depends upon whether or not they’ve met my mom.  Because my mom patiently listens to these people – in church foyers, in her living room, in grocery stores, on the telephone, at school – but she doesn’t just politely nod and wonder when its going to be over.  Instead, she makes contact with that person again.  Asks them questions about their crisis (real or perceived), she keeps contact with them, tells them honest things that they may or may not have already observed, introduces them to the network of other people who she’s collected and continues to pour her time and her energy and love into them for as long as they need it or will receive it.    My mother collects needy people. And she pours her life into them.  Several years ago, she won the Muskegon, Michigan Mother-of-the-Year Award and when it was time for essays to be submitted for judging – her four children all submitted our essays, but these other people who she has poured her life into testified to her mothering too.  Because once Gloria Rudd has collected you, your life will not be the same.   When I was a little boy, we would listen to music on phonographs together.  Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven.  She would beckon me into the music helping me feel the music with my body as well as my ears. Thumping the downbeats of the song on my chest with her powerful pianist hands.  Drawing my attention to the dramatic, inevitable, driving fatedness of these composers she loved.  The cellos and the basses and the timpani gave their music gravity, intentionality, purpose and direction.  The majesty they generate is tinged by a sense of the tragic and the profound.  They march toward the kind of greatness that can only be earned by understanding the great sorrows that life affords.    My mom’s motivation, purity of vision, and passionate devotion is rooted in a deep understanding of sadness.  I’ve never known anyone else who could cry as deeply and quickly and genuinely as my mother.  Goodbyes.  Deaths.  Conflict.  Illness. Loss.  Disappointment.  My mother’s ability to Understand these emotions so personally also gives her the fortitude to live in a way that is so clearly directed toward helping people into the Kingdom.   My mom does not wear beige.   She does wear turquoise, dramatically draped black,  exotically patterned fabric, gold lame.  And Red Hair.  So when some well meaning friend advised her before my wedding that the mother of the groom wears beige, it became a running joke through all three of her son’s weddings.  She didn’t and doesn’t wear beige.  I suppose people who wear beige do not produce musicals either.  My mother does.  She has an amazing sensibility of balancing spectacle and story.  In the twenty or so  theatrical productions that she’s directed and produced, every one of them has had (intentional) surprises so breathtaking that the audience erupts in applause.  It could be costumes, lighting, explosions, pulleys, multi-media, casts of (literally) hundreds.  When I started getting surprising hair cuts, wearing clothes from different decades and wearing glasses that I did not need – my mom teased that I thought of clothes as costumes.  But we both always knew where I got a respect for the spectacular and the theatrical.   People who wear beige do not know how to tell good stories.  One of the most enjoyable moments to watch my mother is when she’s telling a story to three-year-olds.  She loses herself so fully in the story that she becomes every character – unique voices, ridiculous gestures, dramatic pauses, thrilling conflicts.  I try to channel her whenever I’m telling stories to my children or when I’m in the three year old class at church.  The ability to commit fully to a story is more than a way to entertain three year olds – it’s a way of being in the world more completely and fully.    Beige wearing people don’t know a good glissando when they hear one.   In  The Lovely Bones  – the main character is a fourteen year old girl who dies long before she should have.  When she arrives in Heaven, she’s surprised to find that it’s a series of soccer fields, playgrounds and wide open, well mowed spaces.  This particular heaven is only shared by others who would have found that space to be perfect on earth.  If I had to pick a heaven,  it would be a tough choice, I’ve had a really good life, but one of the top choices would be –  Lying in bed with the lights out and down the long hallway of the ranch house echo the gentle fingers of my mother playing and playing and playing the piano.  Sometimes she would be practicing a particularly troublesome phrase, more often --just playing.  Laying there hovering just above sleep I would feel profoundly that the music was a kind of visceral fabric that bound my brothers and sister and father together throughout the otherwise quiet house in the rhythms, the melodies, the countermelodies and always, the sweeping glissandos.  My mom drags her finger up the keyboard, but then slows each of the last notes to one by one keys at the top of the scale and just before the next musical phrase starts there is the slightest of pauses, too brief to fit all of these words into, but long enough that your soul starts to yearn expectantly toward the resolution of the chord, the forward motion of the music, the next great possibility.    This is what my life with my mother has been like.  A dramatic, spectacular, creative, expressive sweep up across a keyboard, but then, as the next movement is almost ready to begin there is that very intentional movement of those strong, short fingers over two maybe three notes – to remind me and us that our lives, that my life, are to be lived toward the future.  We work toward the resolution of the chord, toward the possibility of the next movement, and with the clear careful intentionality of someone rooted in the sadness but celebrating the joy that defines the most perfect music.  thank you for that music, mom.    Happy Mothers Day

      . housekeeping .  i've been cleaning out my office, scrubbing under my kitchen sink and now i've fooled a bit with the links bar over yonder...  went back to my old format of including some recommendations along with the blogs of friends and family.    i've decided *not* to include student blogs -- an arbitrary "line" demarcating where my confusing "front burner" and "back burner" leave off from one another.  Some of you will recognize that former students who have now been promoted to official "friend" status have been retained.    Been having wierd dreams where my college friends go on trips with me and my students and my family members morph into old acquaintances.  they feel like a metaphor for the contents of the FIVE trashcans i filled with paper two days ago (and i'm only half way done!) -- an amalgam of all material evidence for the fragmented and profound experiences that have constituted the "me" many of you know...  peace~

      . the danger of letting your prophets get in bed with your prostitutes .  i'm so upset by this news.  this is from  urlLink sojourners :    Disney slips a mickey to Michael Moore movie  The Walt Disney Company, corporate purveyor of mass-marketed media and entertainment, has pulled the plug on Michael Moore's latest film project, "Fahrenheit 9/11," which probes the Bush family's financial ties to illustrious Saudis (including Osama bin Laden's family), going back 30 years. Disney's Miramax division had financed the film and was set to release it this summer, when Disney CEO Michael Eisner objected, citing his fear of the movie's "partisan nature." Another top executive expressed concern that the politically provocative content would alienate some of the more conservative patrons of Disney entertainment. Moore and others critical of Disney's decision say Disney fears the controversial material in the documentary would jeopardize the company's tax breaks in the state of Florida, where Jeb Bush is governor.   Moore's anticipated release, following his blockbuster "Bowling for Columbine" (which grossed $22 million in North America) is rife with his signature predilection for hounding wealthy and elite profiteers and politicians. Disney has refused to renege on its decision not to promote the film, though it now appears that they will sell it back to Miramax for independent promotion.    Unbelievable! I was really banking on the populist appeal and the resonance of Micheal Moore's voice to help in the great unseating of November...  After perusing  urlLink Michael Moore's  website a little more, I see that this scandal has been in the press for about a month.  Where have i been ?!

      . ten minute posts .  i've been reading plays lately.  lots of tragedies.  do you know what tragedies are? (i know you do, i'm not trying to be pedantic. i've just realized anew what they are.)  tragedies are endings where characters realize something about themselves that they've been avoiding.   so last night as i polished off a few glasses of mark's homemade great wine -- i had a moment which, if i were to have died or been raptured (imagine my surprise at *that* moment) or a curtain come sweeping across his porch and thunderous (or measly applause) followed, would have been tragic.   i asked mark to be honest as i pitched him the play i've been toiling over for a few days.  i love how well mark's b.s. detector works.  he was "intrigued," but he said words that were a deathknell even through my buzz and the beautiful summer air. "sounds therapeutic."  shit.   "therapeutic."  ugh.    so now i'm back to trying to figure out what story to spend my summer developing.  i've had brilliant and confusing conversations with my friends  urlLink gary  and  urlLink cliff  -- these in-the-process-of-succeeding filmmakers who i'm *so* glad to have as friends.  (they weren't confusing. i think that they have life much more by the balls than i.  its me and what i want and what i've done and where i am thats confusing.)   didn't it seem like everyone you knew who was thirtysomething was a little more sure of what they were up to than you feel like you are now that you're (t/)here.    i love (/hate) these the the lyrics:   Mirror, mirror on the wall You've watched me grow since I was small So what will I regret the most The things I do or the things I don't? The deeper you peer into my soul You'll find that I already know  But I can't say it Because I can barely face it My life is halfway through And I still haven't done What I'm here to do  so my new plan is:   (my new plans! -- if i had a nickel for every new plan)  ten minute posts only...  so rants might get curbed in the middle....  the happiest part of my day?  i get to go out with Lynn, my girlfriend, who i miss lately, but i think is incredibly attractive.  i'm hoping to get lucky...  peace~

      . Haves and Have Nots.  .   caveat: I wrote this before i read the  urlLink pirate-bishops response  to my  urlLink politicoblog .  i'll respond to his erudite argument next time out.   I don’t believe, as do many of my democratic peers, that one of the primary problems in our country is the widening gap between the haves and the have nots.  At least not as long as the haves and the have nots are measured with income and wealth and possessions and net worth.  I’m trying with all my energy NOT to believe the lie(s) of the advertising-industrial complex that buying things / having things will make me:   More fulfilled.  More happy.  More secure.  More sophisticated. More hip. More erudite.  More rebellious. More normal. More stable. More excited.  On the other hand, I do believe that the widening gap between the haves and the have nots is important when it deals with:   Opportunity.   Specifically, the opportunity to find work which reinforces people’s humanity, individuality and belonging.  Specifically, the opportunity to find work which allows people to have and care for children if they so desire.  Specifically, the opportunity to develop your own interests and gift set regardless of the socio-economic strata into which you were born.   How are these opportunities pertinent in this election?   I’ve been convinced that multi-national corporations are one of the most egregious inhibitors of these specific opportunities.  They don’t have to be.  I think its perfectly plausible that multi-national corporations could provide all of the opportunities I outline above.  I just think that in general, they don’t.    Starbucks would be an example of a multi-national corporation that does, more than others, attempt to achieve these ideals. (I know Starbucks has its problems.)  Again, the question, Andrew, how are multinational corporations relevant to the election?    (Unfortunately, we don’t elect CEOs, CFOs or boards…whether we’re stakeholders or not.)  Here’s how: Republicans, in general, believe that the freer a market is, the more wealth (and thus – opportunity) will be created.  The opportunities for the have nots emerges from the “compassionate conservativism” – the money from the wealth trickles and/or is donated down to efforts to help the under-privileged.  Democrats (particularly progressive ones – like Clinton, Gore & Kerry) believe that while economic development (capital / wealth creation) is an essential force in nation and world building, the free reign of markets must be held in tension with the rights and needs of workers.  THAT tension gets played out over and over again in many ongoing campaign issues.

      . Politicoblogging .  Oh come on, it’s election year.  You knew I couldn’t avoid the subject forever.  As some of you know, I am a pretty staunch liberal in my political views.  Having emerged from a right wing family / school / lifeworld / upbringing, I think I understand the motivations and underpinnings of conservative political thought.   However, I have to say that in today’s political climate – particularly given the pervasiveness of issues of globalization – the categories of political liberal and conservative are often insufficient.    So I’ll get into that issue on another day.   I want to start politcoblogging with an argument that I think everybody might agree upon.  And when I say everybody, I really mean BishopRudd (eg. The Pirate / Coach / etc) – who is by far the most regularly-opposed, but brilliantly-analytical reader that I have.  Here it is:   People are voting too often for issues as they affect them directly and individually INSTEAD of voting for the good of the country (and mutatis mutandi, the larger world).  If voters were more focused upon the general good of everyone when they voted, then democracy would be working optimally (both thriving on participation and encouraging participation).  People are far too concerned (on the right and the left) about which candidate will protect their interests.  I’m arguing that this self interest can only devolve into worse and worse politics.    Effects of this attitude:  political rhetoric becomes increasingly partisan, single-issue-focused, and non-wholistic; voter attrition; special interest lobby groups become increasingly powerful in swinging elections.   I believe that this problem proceeds from the left and the right equally, and I’d just like to do my part during this election to push every person that I know to think about voting NOT as being about protecting your own interests, but instead as an opportunity to think about –   The greatest needs for our country.    And then ask: What is the best way to address those needs?  Of course this also allows me to explain what I see as the greatest needs for the USA and how those perceived needs influence my vote.  But that’s a later blog.  peace~

       For everyone who has will be given more, and she will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.   Back where i grew up, one of the things people did was that they really liked "verses."  The ancient text of the Bible was parsed into smaller digestible numbered bits a while back and these bits are called "verses."  What's strange to me now that I'm far away from that world is -- how some of these little bits come to mean strange things for people:   1. people memorize verses.  that's right -- just the little bits -- don't give me the whole idea, please, its too much, and not very easy to insert into the myriad of situations that i might like to insert this little bit.  2. people string together verses to create new wholes.  this hermeneutic practice is actually widely practiced throughout christendom.  the wild and wacky part occurs when the longstanding commercialism braided with Christianity -- and particularly American christianity -- seizes upon one of these strung together bits-cum-wholes and develops an entire discourse around the new whole.  Example:  The Romans Road.  Jeremiah 29:11.  3.  oh, and speaking of Jeremiah 29:11 -- people "claim" these bits. I'm not, honestly, entirely sure what it means to CLAIM a bit of scripture, but I've got a little bit of an idea.   One day Lynn and I were walking down a perfectly average sidewalk in our little suburban allotment in Bowling Green Ohio, when my eyes lit upon a small bit of paper.  I picked it up.  (See, I claimed it.) It had been torn from a little message pad and in loopy cursive letters the note read:   "You can try, but you'll never get rid of me."  I loved this note for all kinds of reasons.  For me, most of those reasons were the rich storied-ness that he note evoked.  I put it on my refrigerator with tape.  I told Daniel about it and he laughed hard.  He said that we should try.   Try what? I said.   Try flushing it down the toilet.  Burning it.  Burying it.  See what happens.   Spoken like a true literalist, my brother had succeeded in "claiming" the note much more totally than I.  For him the rhetor I had imagined -- a love-crazed tenth grader, panicked and vengeful, a furtive moment of stuffing a note in backpack too loosely -- had been erased completely.  For him the note itself spoke.  It taunted us from our refrigerator much like Dagon, god of the philistines, and Sampson, his faithful worshipper taunted the Hebrews.  And I can imagine any number of crazed characters who have paraded through our house taking the note a different way.    Can I have a drink? she asks.    Sure. I say. Help yourself. nodding toward the kitchen.  And as she stands in front of the refrigerator, water streaming into the cup, she looks at the note. "Did he send me to get this water so i would look at this note?  Are the Rudds threatening me?  They don't think I can get rid of them?  *That's* why he told me to go get this water."  And with the cup of water still sitting on the formica counter of our BG kitchen, she fled to her car and oddly enough, we've never seen her again.   Again!  She claims it DIFFERENTLY.   This seems like the power and horror of stories moving across time and locale.  Their meanings shift so profoundly.  And so fast.    Likewise these bits of paper / scripture....  When I came to this job at this "evangelical" college -- someone asked me (as someone is prone to ask everyone when they come here): "Whats your life verse?"  Which means, I guess that you're clinging to one particular bit more than any other, right?  I want to be the guy who follows one of the EIGHT MILLION  urlLink jeremiah 29:11  thieves and announce that mine is:     "in your family line there will never be an old man. Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life."    You can find it  urlLink here  if you want to claim it.  Or better yet, my brother's favorite:  urlLink Ezekiel 23:20 .  My point? That excerpting scripture and divorcing it from context in order to affirm yourself / your strength / your confidence is bad?  mmmm, not completely.   My point was actually that in the middle of the scripture reading at church on Sunday, I leaned over to Lynn and said, "Hey.  urlLink That's  my new life verse." (referring to that bit at the top of this blog...)  You'll have to read  urlLink the whole story  yourself to confirm my interpretation -- but this interpretive hook that Jesus offers to me turns the world upside down.  Here's my down and dirty rendering of what this story is saying:   "You wanna be rich?  treat what you have like its the best resource *ever*.  you wanna be poor? Treat what you have like its not enough."  Ouch. and Wow.

      summer schedule is less strenuous.  tho' its harder to deal with the tasks that do vie for our attention with this season in full swing.   we're lucky to spend much more time with the kids these days.  both of whom are very winning and delightful.   Addison is much more charismatic the older he gets -- and simultaneously -- more prone to temper.  Jaelyn is increasingly nurturing and kind.  its funny that sometimes when your kids are in a phase where they aren't really *struggling* behaviourally -- you start to notice and think about some of the kinds of emotional battles they might face internally across their life. but i'm not blogging about those.    its one kind of irresponsibility to blog about one's own inner terrain.  to discuss one's child's inner life seems an altogether more heinous kind of sin.   We show our house to disinterested buyers 3 - 5 times a week.  we're beginning to rethink our move.   we've been able to see more friends and family over the last few weeks -- a quick trip to michigan, several dinner parties, lunches, coffees and beers with old students.   One of Lynn's students was killed in a car accident this week.  This kind of thing is deeply horrifying.  It makes the whole universe feel SO fragile and random.  Lynn's moved her birthday to July 25th in case you hadn't heard -- so -- if appropriate, you should start thinking about what card you'll be sending.  We'll be at the cabin, so send it early.    i'm preaching (!) at my church in a few weeks.  a funny byproduct of telling old "preacherboy contest" stories at a party after too many glasses of wine....  our day to day grind:   Lynn teaches secondary teachers at the downtown school every morning.   i teach an upper division "persuasion" course to five students on tuesday nights for four hours.   we're both mired in "assessment" tasks -- an ongoing reminder that the *business* of school is a bueracracratic maze of self-perpetuating, navel-gazing, oft irrelevant set of hoops that oftener than not rewards hoop jumpers.   which, i suppose, is a good lesson for everyone: hoopjumpers and asskissers get rewards when living and working in highly rationalized instutions.  and a reminder of the thing that i said to my student/friend russ the other day who was apologetically telling me that he was thinking of looking for a corporate pr job.   NO! i insisted to him.  I WANT you to go work for Hoover or GM or GE or MONSANTO or MTV or NIKE.  If nobody GOOD goes to work there -- than the evil and the greed can never be undone.   EVERYONE who wants to change the world on a systemic level -- must decide to work within institutions where they BOTH comply and RESIST!  I didn't say it then, but in retrospect, i should have said:  isn't it HARDER to have good values and work in an institution that disagrees -- finding places where you can comply / resist with meaning and purpose -- than it is to only work in environments that are self-confirming?   and...  speaking of working for the man --   i agreed to be the department chair next year.  i'm right on track for the career i THOUGHT i wanted when I was graduating from college 12 years ago --   to be the PRESIDENT of a small college.   A job / life / career that i *do not* want now.   NOW?    i want to tell stories.   help more people to tell stories and live by stories.  and find more ways for justice and peace to eek out into the world.  ...  we've taught our children the following axiom to which nathan and josiah have objected:   "violence always escalates."  doesn't too much compliance to institutions yield violence ultimately -- which will, in turn escalate?   and doesn't resistance to insitutions ultimately yield peace and justice.  but do peace and violence ultimately escalate?  de-escalate?  it seems like some buddhist htinking might be helpful on this question.  or some mennonite thinking.   anyone?   peace~

      some people are offended when i say that i don't watch adam sandler movies or jim carrey movies.  i've undergone several phases of thinking regarding the usefulness and value of these texts -- so thought i'd put some of my thoughts into the blogosphere for some reflection.  the free dictionary dot com offers this definition of a:   mug - the human face (`kisser' and `smiler' and `mug' are informal terms for `face' and `phiz' is British)  so mugging -- would be -- really using the face for some use, right?   and that seems, in my opinion to be mostly what Jim Carrey & Adam Sandler (the cultural products, not the people or the actors) are about.  They both have the ability to MUG in inspired ways.    Hilarious ways.  When they use their face (or bodies) to perfection -- these guys are VERY very funny.   So why don't I watch their movies?    For me its always been a sort of dis-ease about the ways that MUGGING does not serve the story that they're telling.    I liked both of these guys in sketch comedy shows -- and IF i watch a portion of either of their movies -- I laugh.  Hard.   But then, if i happen to try to watch a WHOLE story -- I don't.  I groan.  I grow weary.  I turn them off.  Because it seems like (in most cases) the story becomes incidental to the punchline of their gloriously funny faces.    Like the story is the setup and their FACE is the punchline.   I used to say that I didn't like them because they weren't acting.  I still think that this particular STYLE of "acting" while it doesn't at all serve the story (or their "character" within the story) -- it also probably isn't who THEY are -- so it probably is a kind of performance -- "acting" might be an appropriate name.   But ultimately, I don't think there's anything BAD about what they're up to.  I think it just belongs in sketch comedy shows.  Not in movies.   Even the GOOD stories that some of their movies started out as -- are -- it seems -- ill served by this MUGGING.  Mugging does, now, however, serve up juicy "quotes" -- which end up getting bantered about in social groups -- weaving a textual fabric of continuity around most social networks like a warm media blanket.   Not that there's anything wrong with that.  In fact, it seems like a really great side benefit.  Clearly the biggestt and most central benefit to this kind of punchline-driven approach to character or story -- is that each MUG -- each quotable bit -- each hilarious gesture -- memorable line -- BECOMES a kind of an advertisement that is ongoing for the franchise which is --   Adam Sandler.   or   Jim Carrey.  which is why, I suppose that these movies are considered "vehicles" for their stars....but what gets eroded in a world where most people JUST see these movies INSTEAD of movies with more subtle humor -- which reward the patience and attention of a faithful audience is --   story.   and particularly comic story.   Kenneth Burke calls the Comic Frame -- "equipment for living."  and unless we can weave a comic perspective back into our understanding of WHOLE characters -- and broad sequential and consequential sweeps of human action --   we lose valuable equipment for living.   i'm not the culture snob i once was who sneered at these movies or anyone who watched them -- but i want to remind people that they're just watching sketch comedy when they engage these films.  And that, while sketch comedy is a VALUABLE way to start building our comic frames -- its insufficient to build hearty structures which will allow us to the see the world more truly.   i'm eight minutes past the ten minute post rule.  So that means you're asleep.  Not reading anymore.    But if you are awake, I'd love to be engaged on this topic...  peace~  ** in a technology-gaffe-deletion -- Gary makes the worthwhile contribution that *Punch Drunk Love* & *Eternal Happiness* are worthwhile exceptions.  I concur and add *Man on the Moon* and *Truman Show*

      i wrote a post that i self-monitored (and decided not to post) while i was in michigan.  a wall of depression broke over my head for no rational reason in the middle of a conversation / debate -- around the table-o-great-fun.   it was the old:  i'm from here?  i'm from here.  i'm from....?  malaise.  my post was all about.   Ahh.  We can never go home.  *Home* is eroded by globalization and mass media and monopolizing capitalism.   the good news is that it was a brief wave of hysteria -- passed quickly -- had a fun weekend -- and by the end was able to say again.    i am from there.    there is where i come from.  i think i recently rediscovered the part of my fundamentalist heritage which had me entering (and winning, goshdarnit) preacher boy contests -- here on the blog.  as a result i started sketching out a script -- a short & long version of _Preacher Boy_....  but from everything that i've been reading --  urlLink SAVED  is a story straight from the same universe....  in some ways its hard to say with pride that i'm *from* a fundamentalist world -- but i think the difficulty is more in that i've chosen to emerge to a position not to far off from it -- still very associated with the structures and institutions of evangelical christianity -- more that loose connection than it is about any personal responsibility i bear for the horrible things i used to say and do and believe.   i'm thinking of switching to a new tagline for the backburner -->  Stories:Here & Now:Eachother . Dot . Blog  I've been thinking that that moment when you pull up next to someone on a city street -- at a stopline or in the passing lane, and you both look over at each other -- that that moment is pretty profound.  its like a hyper-performance of all kinds of cultural meaning.   Here we are: we think at each other:  strangers.  Staring at each other. How embarrassing.  How normal. How fleeting.  How ridiculous.   And then we don't think, but our milieu hums to itself:   How Identical They Are!  How Oblivious!  How they rush together to an anonymous simultaneous secret!  How they move in tandem!  But how unrecognizable their dance is to themselves!  Its getting late isn't it?  Today the world feels cruel and steely and absurd to many of my student/friends.  And for them, to me it does too.  I'm thinking of you all day, mourning friends.  peace~

      . security / obscurity .  favorite memory of an adult sunday school teacher:  "I think its important for us to remember that ANGER (poignant pause) is one letter away from DANGER."   how i wish i would have raised my hand to say with equal seriousness:  "And lets don't forget, too, then that DANGER is one letter away from (poignant pause of my own) DANCER."   Mmmm.  Serious nods all around.    Seriously, though, I'm locked out of my email account (and that is an excuse and apology to those of you who are waiting for an email from me) because I forgot to change my password.   And on the one hand, I love living in a world where knowing MAGIC WORDS actually beckons an alterante reality (passwords / internet), but on the other hand -- in moments like these i remember that passwords always stand for something more than just SECURITY.   Even in castles where little windows with grates over them in huge oaken doors slid open to hear (or not to hear) a password) -- passwords meant the same thing.  In groups.  Out groups.    Most of the time I am annoyed when I lose my access to the internet -- frustrated if I go a day without an email fix -- aggravated if I can't jot a thought into the blogosphere.  But rarely do I take a moment to recognize that my password stands for privilege.  That indeed all the varieties of obscure numbers and letters that are tied in some mnemonic way to my past and thus to my avatar presence in the www --> should simultaneously remind me that not everyone has such a bother in their world.    Some of you cram a few minutes in at the library.  Some of you leave your connection streaming and open around the clock.  But at least we all have passwords of some kind or another.    In keeping with my new life verse -- I want to recognize amidst my annoyance with I.T. today that -- this annoyance is great wealth.  I want to invite you to, with me, name the privilege that you have of looking at the glowing screen in front you.    And, for our Estados Unidos readership -- Happy Memorial Day -- may our memories of sacrifice move us closer to --  peace~

      I went upstairs last night because I could hear that Addison and Jaelyn were playing upstairs an hour past bedtime.  I told them to give each other a hug and say goodnight before I took Addison back to his room.  They exchanged a heartfelt embrace, and just before I lifted Addison away, Jaelyn said: “Wait a minute, Daddy, I want to say a prayer.”  I paused, she folded her hands old-school style.   “Dear Jesus.  Please help me make good decisions with my toys and not bring them into bed.  And please help Addison stay in bed when I call him to come over.  Amen.” .

      bumped into this fragment:    Patience is not waiting passively until someone else does something. Patience asks us to live the moment to the fullest, to be completely present to the moment, to taste the here and now, to be where we are. When we are impatient, we try to get away from where we are. We behave as if the real thing will happen tomorrow, later, and somewhere else. Be patient and trust that the treasure you are looking for is hidden in the ground on which you stand.   - Henri J.M. Nouwen    and it SO reminded me of  urlLink the point that i was talking about from the parable of the stewards .  I've rarely felt such convergence around my spiritual life and its connection to the rest of my life...  and the wierd thing is how its been sustained in so many small and seemingly unconnected ways for the past few weeks.  But on patience for a moment.    last friday Jaelyn, Addison and I went garage saling.  For like four hours.  They were even more into it than I was.    I made them chant the four things we were looking for before and after each sale:   1. balls 2. bats 3. mitts 4. helmets  that way if they saw other stuff - i could say -- enh.  its not on the list.   in the end we bought:   1. a toy bow and arrow 2. two frog puppets 3. a pottery mug.   but when it was time to go home for lunch, Addison was desperate.  We couldn't stop! he insisted.  We hadn't found a helmet.   We have to be patient, I reminded him. It's so hard to be patient isn't it?   We should go to a store. He said.  But I reminded him that waiting for the universe to unfold karma in her time would be much better for us.  We would learn about waiting, we would remember that good things take time.  We would *earn* the helmet.   Ok so i didn't say the stuff about karma.  but i thought it.   And later Jaelyn was feeling impatient for dinner.  She was persevorating on the point.  Daddy, I'm hungry.  When is it going to be ready!?  And so we talked about how it had been hard for Addison, because he was only thinking about that helmet.    Being patient means that we choose to let go of the future possibility.  The thing we want but don't have and focus on something RIGHT HERE.  .  i have, historically, referred to myself as a gypsy.  but suddenly find that i may just be developing some place-roots.  which is freaky and not completely comfortable.  the UTNE reader had an article two issues ago about  urlLink how long it takes to really see something ...  and this idea that patience is a prerequisite to seeing is one that I learned a hundred years ago at the Cabin sitting on a rock in the lagoon.  And one that I tried to learn while I researched my dissertation at a hundred garage sales, but suddenly it feels so big...  such a vast invitation...

      or at least thats how i feel today when i accidentally bump into  urlLink the center for progressive christianity ....  while i saw at least one name floating around who thinks quite differently than i do (Marcaus Borg and I disagree (in a parasocial way -- since he doesn't know me) about reading the Bible as "truth")...  the  urlLink core teachings  they articulate *really* resonate with me -- much more fully even than the articulations of "emergent church" that i've encountered.  so in case you've been wondering whether andrew *really* believed anything at all (since he's more likely than not to raise one eyebrow at a good deal of evangelical christianity) -- the answer, today is -- i believe!

      i had a girlfriend named shannon in high school.  We "went together" for two years.    During tenth grade we talked on the phone every night sometimes for close to an hour.  I hate talking on the telephone as a rule, but these conversations were worse.  We bickered.  Sat silently.  And she told me how terrible her family was.  I told her how much I hated our high school.   i'm sure there were happy memories, but i don't remember that part of the relationship.   she broke up with me at Dennys after church one sunday.  we were sitting at a table that went in a circle with another table.  at the other table four senior citizens ate, not speaking, listening to all the gory details.  i don't remember the gory details; i just remember that high school seemed much worse now.    one day my mom came and picked me up in the middle of the day and took me out of my classes.  i was horribly depressed.  we had lunch at the brownstone, my favorite restaurant which was in the airport and then sat in our station wagon at the beach in the middle of the winter.  The waves were huge.  I cried and couldn't talk about much and then eventually we were laughing about something ridiculous.  that's the Lampiris (my mom's family) way.  last night Shannon and her entire family showed up in my dream.  They were being feted at my dad's church for 25 years of faithful attendance.  They all have blond hair and were smiling like it was a promotional for a new talk show.  People just looked at them in awe.  They opened a few presents, but mostly just laughed like they were on stage.    back when i went over to their house they yelled at each other like i had never heard a family yell.  One of them sat in a chair and didn't talk at all, just watched tv.  He didn't go to church either.  but he was on the wednesday night prayer list as a result....  we liked going to their house, though, because the were allowed to rent VCRs and Video Cassette Tapes from the local video store.  That was still too close to Hollywood for the rest of our families.   Ahh the good old days.

       urlLink my brother raises a question on his blog  which has buzzed around in my head for more than 24 hours, so I thought I’d simmer on it for awhile.   He mentions our friend Chad who had one of his most formative experiences in a trip to Australia…he (cryptically) mentions a week in October of 1994 as being formative for him, and then he invites us in:   What week has been most formative in your life?   I commented that I haven’t had any such weeks – but I have had seasons of life which I identify as transformative and revelatory, but ultimately, even in retrospect, they lack a cumulative property.    Instead such months / cycles / seasons / (and frequently) semesters – seem to reform previous insights and directions into wholly other experiences. Directions I had not expected.  I don’t want to say that these bursts of discovery and meaning have rendered my life more discontinuous than continuous, but on the other hand…were you to try to turn my life journey into a map, it’d be hard to see a unified direction…  And for me that’s the why the question keeps BUZZING.  When you use a metaphor like “formative” (the original title for this post) – it automatically renders past experiences meaningful in a sort of entelechial way.    In the best scenario – such experiences also render the  present  eminently more meaningful, congruent and whole.   This is not something just my brother does.  I do it.  You do it.  We do it. I’m convinced that the human capacity to tell-stories-in-order-to-survive…is a quite basic phenomenon – maybe even the MOST basic (sociological) human phenomenon.  I guess its those moments when you find yourself WITHOUT A STORY – that you feel most precarious.  I’m not feeling liminoid right now.  David’s question actually provoked me to start thinking about a whole set of stories that render my current life meaningful – but it also provoked me to think about the insufficiencies and partiality of those stories.   Hope today is formative - transformative - revelatory and/or (since it is the Christian Sabbath) full of …  peace~

      just went back in time to watch a paul schrader flick that i didn't watch back in the day.     urlLink      urlLink bringing out the dead    (and i, too, like some of you, can't help but use a princess bride voice in my head when i say the title.)   but in general i liked this movie much more than I expected to.  i remember that it got uneven reviews back in the day, but ultimately i really liked the story.   schrader seems to be always writing these stories which are straight up redemption stories with a very sort of clear grammar of fall and redemption -- but never so on the nose that you walk away from the movie feeling preached at.  in fact, what i think i like MOST about his movies is that often, his *very flawed* hero is weary and desperate, but in some way recovering or doing better than he has been doing -- and then he gets faced with this temptation which is very clearly the point of entry *back* into the darkness that he was starting to emerge from -- and here's where the stroke of genius (for me) is -- Schrader has made the character's self / longings / motivations so *real* to me -- that I want it too. For the character.  Even while I don't want it.  While I hate it.  I, the viewer, can enter pretty fully into the magnitude of the moral choice.  Understand the stakes, and then choose the *wrong* road.  I don't feel like writers are able to make us feel so much consonance with the characters very often.    urlLink Light Sleeper  &  urlLink Auto Focus  really have this same thing going on, too.   And so if and when the characters make it out of the slough of despondence that they choose (different outcomes in each of these movies) - it feels *so much more* hard won / lost -- so much more MOVING to me as a viewer.   (some of bringing out the dead *is* uneven.  use of voice over, jarring camera work which isn't evenly utilized throughout the film.  some bits that seem tonally wrong -- BUT ultimately, i'd argue that the story (all the plot points) and the characters *work* really well.)  Reminds me of Pedro The Lion's work.  Beautiful depiction of the darkness ends up alluding to the beauty of hope and light, too...  peace~

      clipping  urlLink from sojourners  --   When I was growing up, it was continually repeated in my evangelical Christian world that the greatest battle and biggest choice of our time was between belief and secularism. But I now believe that the real battle, the big struggle of our times, is the fundamental choice between cynicism and hope. The choice between cynicism and hope is ultimately a spiritual choice, and one that has enormous political consequences.    good words follow these -- all from Jim Wallis' Stanford Commencement address.  He talks about  vocation  -- inspiring and challenging for those of us who often think of ourselves as adrift in that particular river of questions...

About Scalzo, the judges wrote: "Writes with attitude and confidence. All of his stories and columns are a pleasure to read."   Scalzo also finished in third place as best sports columnist with the judges writing: "Funny stuff, self-deprecating at times. Written to be enjoyed. Columns have attitude and personality without being arrogant."   if you want to write to Joe --  urlLink email me  -- and i'll send you his e-mail.  those of you who are his friends aren't surprised to hear him praised as a talented writer -- i just want to know when he managed to get that arrogant tone out of his voice...

      Given my post yesterday, this email update from Nicole Poston, a woman in my church, (who is studying spanish in Honduras) caught my attention.  She's talking about her teacher:    He teaches me Honderenismos like the phrase you say when you are about to sneeze and then you don’t. De lo arrenpentidos esta lleno el Reino de los Ceilos. The Kingdom of Heaven is full of repenters already.  The idea is that when you sneeze you are repenting,  so when you don’t sneeze people say this to mean, don’t worry too much, there are enough repenters already there.   sneezing / repenting?

      i LOVE sneezing.   it is one of the perfect human experiences.  if i were starting a religion, one of the ten pillars would have to do with how sacred sneezing is.  they expurgate evil fluid.  for some they spring from light.  they include uncontrolled feelings.  they demand complete attention.  they sew together the dialectic of profound felt experience with insistent public expression.  like spiritual insight, they are almost impossible to conjure or manufacture.  a fake sneeze may fool others, but to the faker, its just a stupid irrelevant replica.  ~

       urlLink       urlLink  Capturing the Friedmans  is a compulsively watchable commentary on the american family, the politics of sex in our culture / suburbia, the nature of hysteria...and more subtly on the voyeurism & documentary-culture which define:   the blogosphere.  reality television.  parasocial relationships / industry exploitation of celebrity culture.   i'm not a naysayer of any of these cultural realities.  obviously i'm in the blogosphere with two feet...but the mcluhanesque idea that we only understand the ways our technology impacts us -- "in the rear view mirror and fading fast" -- seems particularly apt in this particular story.   the filmmakers have a tenderness for all of their characters -- and it would be easy for them to demonize several of the characters -- so the remarkable ability to maintain the full roundess of David (the amateur documentarian) and the Mom...  is amazing.   The final shot of Howard Friedman -- is a coup in the whole voyeurism subplot which involves YOU the viewer in a complicated ambivalent relationship with your own watching (a story line arguably initiated with David's dictum, "If you're not me, STOP watching this!  This is PRIVATE!)  and on a MUCH lighter note --   but a great documentation of the *beauty* of how a cultural performance can give some otherwise marginal members of a group both a grammar and a voice for participation in (ultimately) the larger cultural millieu is --    urlLink      urlLink Spellbound   and while we're on the subject -- the other must-see-andrew-list-of-documentaries-for-everybody?   urlLink  Hoop Dreams       urlLink American Movie      and  urlLink hands on a hard body      for a less universal recommendation, but a must-watch if you live in my geographical world --    urlLink Go Tigers  is a great depiction of the complexities of how football culture interplays with everything else here in mideastern Ohio.

      i mean that title NOT in the way you first read it.   there's been a horrific shift in the american political landscape which conflates:   celebrity culture *&* infotainment *&* religious discourse   and now people say things (regularly) like:   but, how you know that he (X politician -- fill in the blank) is _a good christian_.  OR  at least you always know _where he stands on things_.  He takes one position and always sticks to it.  OR  its our duty to support _men of god_ in their political office.  I understand that in the post-clinton / monica-gate / it depends on the what the meaning of is *is*...  that the idea of a SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD LEADER seems like a good solution to the danger of legalese shiftyness.  but this morning, while reading the news, I bumped into  urlLink this story about the "godly" John Ashcroft  whose minions have been working night and day to carefully parse the meaning of  SEVERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUFFERING -- words which constrain the define the borderland between torture and coercion within the US consititution....  Of course this stuff probably won't get airtime or real play in the mainstream newsmedia -- but the reality is that politics and government and legislative demand an ability to live in the murky realms of grey which define the ugly land of legalese...  why won't the evangelicals pass around excerpts from this memo on email linked up to what a faithful upstanding member of his congregation Ashcroft is?   ...  and the problem with voting for George Bush because he's a simple, straighforward fellow is this:    he *is* responsible for all of the specific policy decisions that have been made on his watch by his people.   Cheney's Halliburton fiasco -- is PART of G.W.'s moral character.  Ashcroft's careful legal defense for the untenable torture/coercion at various sites in the U.S. occupation --- IS part of of GW's moral character.   The new US foreign policy of unilateral engagement based on the simple (and wrongheaded) suspicion of WMD  -- is part of GW's moral character.   that is -- if moral character is why we vote on presidents or politicians -- I'd much rather vote on their policies and their appointments.

      here's the list of recommendations from my last two weeks of (catching up) movie viewing:    urlLink Girl With A Pearl Earring      I love how the director / cinematographer cultivate this sense that -- there are ways of seeing the world -- that are better and worse.  All the good ways of seeing include -- paying attention.   by the time Vermeer finds out / connects with / teaches Grete about cultivating a way-to-see-the-world -- we're right along with him.  And her.  Because of the beautiful filming.   And speaking of beautiful filming:    urlLink Elephant        thanks erik for reminding me to rent this film   By Gus Van Sant -- is a great film.  I'm relieved to be able to say so, because, though i Liked GoodWillHunting -- I didn't think it had the same courageous VISION that  urlLink Drugstore Cowboy  &  urlLink My Own Private Idaho  had.  It's like he has this beautiful way of seeing the broken parts of the world.  That definitely comes out in this Columbine-esque tale.    Both films are slow, but demand patient attention.   I had more, but have to go grade...  Thinking of you (that is, if you're reading, those of you who I'm thinking of...)  peace~

      I spilled coffee (not, by any means, a new phenomenon) on my t-shirt this morning, while I was writing.  Today it’s a public television shirt with big bold yellow and red logos, meant to evoke a thrift-store-esque devotion to someone else’s donation / passion / life, recycled and reused in my incarnation.   So coffee, I suppose, only enhances the illusion, right?  It’s like a value-added mark of authenticity.   Last night we were noticing that the purple berries we call mulberries which drop off of the spindly tree next to the driveway and stain the soles of your shoes with their juice in the next two weeks as they ripen – had just started to fall.  Lynn reminded Jaelyn that native peoples use exactly this juice to dye their garments.  “They stain their clothes with these berries like we dyed our shirts yellow.”  It was a few moments later, partway into our nightly walk around our circle when Jaelyn inquired: Mommy, do the native Americans have to wash the stains off of their clothes?   Lynn explained that these colors were intentional like the bright trendy turquoise of jaelyn’s pedal pushers, but Jaelyn was fixated on the stain.  How do they get those stains off?  And suddenly, I’m thinking – why are we always trying to pretend that we don’t have stains….why not treat them with a bit more honor?  After all, its not like clean shirts = no eating.  Not like we’re embarrassed that we eat the food that makes the stains, or drink the coffee that dripped on our shirts.  The food and the drink are not secrets that we’re trying to hide as if we were, say, engaging in liposuction or bulemic purging…  And I’ve always said that I liked scars because they’re like bookmarks or hyperlinks on our bodies that assure us that our past genuinely happened to us – was not actually a dream – and that we are in a really concrete way connected to our otherwise unbelievable pasts.    And if you think about it – scars are just a more naturally occurring case of the same thing that tattoos accomplish.    Someone decides to get a tattoo in order to translate NOW into ALWAYS.  They’re kind of like an F-U to mortality. Right? Because they’re only a good financial risk if they’re going to stay around for a long time.  And they’re bound to stay around for a long time if you stay around. And they assert that whatever it is you’re feeling or being or loving NOW is something you’re going to feel or love or be THEN.  No matter what THEN brings (eg. “I love Billy Bob” turns out to be a bad gamble more often than not).  Which is admirable in a world of avatars and fleeting chimeras – someone who actually IS something so completely that they can afford to translate there is-ness to their skin so that people can actually read how is they actually are.    And lets face it – tattoos are pervasive enough now, that we all know that they are SO over.   And scars do seem like a very hip, edgy alternative, but intentional scarring seems a bit – well – inconvenient -- to me right now.  So it seems like stains are the PERFECT way to go.  All the permanence and expressive value of a tattoo, sans risk and commitment.    That’s why I’m leaving my coffee stain on my shirt this morning…

      all weekend, over and over again, i've been thinking that one of the most poignant ways that our world feels broken is the dearth of storytelling.  we have ceded our attention and our voices to multimediaconglomerates....who, i do not feel simply angry toward.  i recognize that they are a product of desire, and that they have facilitated possibilities in storytelling that would not otherwise be possible, but...  so few people own stories which are their own.    so few people knit their lives together with others by using the shared experiences that they rehearse.  so few of us allow narrative sensitivity to guide our time instead of clocks, watches and "minutes" & "hours" (whatever those are...!)  and i?  i'm going to do something about it.

      nathan, who understood my lectures better than most students, (probably because he was subjected to more of them) shared debate trips with me, made me laugh often, despite his claims to being "a wet blanket," regularly challenged me to think harder about ideas, and who also just happened to (like me) be a part of a group of family singers in his childhood, was united in holy matrimony with shannon.  nathan, it just occured to me that i don't know whether the clifton family singers wore matching outfits like the Rudd family singers.  we always pulled a metal chair up next to the microphone so my two brothers could be the same height as me and my parents and we could all sing our gaither songs or our ron hamilton songs into just one microphone.    i liked our gigs, but i always fantasized about being the Murks.   urlLink     but i digress...  lonette, who is not only a gifted performer, but also a gifted just about everything else.  And my former student/ongoing friend married (the fabulous) Steve on the same day.  These two are ridiculously in love.  And cute (and i mean that in the *good* way) while being able to maintain a bit of an "oh please with the sentimentality" distance from their incredible cuteness...  and rob, who insists upon growing and developing as a person more than most people I've ever met (tae kwon do, the artists way, piano, law, rhetoric -- all just in a span of one year of knowing him) has the ability to _be present_ in a one on one conversation more intensely than anyone you've ever met.  And I haven't met Monica (still!) because they, too, got married on the same day.  And JAN, for whom my daughter Jaelyn is named, an extradordinary friend/sister type to my wife -- and lucky me (not often that folks (me in particular) say this about our inlaws) as an extension of my wife.  Got married on the same day.  I took black and white candids during the whole wedding,  which resulted in this wierd out-of-body-sensation during the whole time.  I was there.  I was *busy* seeing....but I wasn't really there as a *person*.  I didn't sit in the places I usually would have sat, dance as much as i usually would have danced, talk to as many people as I usually would have talked to.    But I liked it.  Being distanced by technology was an insightful, enlightening experience as well as being an odd disembodied one...  it reminded me of how far i was from the other weddings of the people that i loved that day...  which reminded me of how odd it is to live in an era where often the people you love best live far away from you.  but because that very same odd world has given me the opportunity to know nathan and lonette and rob and jan.  i'm grateful too...

      I considered giving up driving for lent last year.  The idea got poo-pood enough (for good and bad reasons) that i stuck it on my back burner.    It would have demanded a lot of bus riding (so - waiting and patience) reliance on the goodwill of friends and family (so - self-abnegation and humility) and coordination of schedules and expectations (so - talk and relationship).  BUT why go through all that when you *have* the other car?  sitting there in the driveway!?  I'm just getting increasingly convinced that when everybody responds to your ideas with "ludicrous!" and "absurd!"  --   maybe thats when you know you're on the right path...

      Just finished an hour and a half of writing.  He's about to drop the cyanide into the wineglass, but I thought I'd save that for tomorrow morning.  I think I've set it up believably, though.   Had two cups a joe.  One english muffin with lemon curd melted into the nooks and crannies, and in anywhere from   one minute to one hour (that's right, i'll be on the precipice of individuality  and parenthood for all that time or just that little bit of time), someone will call out:  DADDY! and I'll:   1. run upstairs and we'll spend about 30-40 minutes waking up, making up stories, tickling and remembering the good old days (specifically, yesterday and the day before)  2. we'll have pancakes, probably with sprinkles cooked into them.   3. we'll bathe in mosquito spray and then ride training-wheeled-bikes at evil-kneivel speeds (addison carefully removing and then replacing his bike helmet EACH time he gets on and off of his bike)  4. we'll play with little people (rough plot line probabilities: the people go to camp.  the people go swimming.  the mommy and the daddy go off to work.  the honies (which is, for whatever reason, what the kids are called) will misbehave and be punished, and/or there will be a volcano and dinosaurs will attack.)  5.  We'll put away our toys (four times).    6. We'll invent a dinner menu. Something on the grill surely.  7.  Based on weather, I'll mow the lawn or not.  8. I'll consider, but decide against:   - cleaning out the gutters,  - power washing the siding - weeding the mulchbeds - painting the entryway and the door  9. a telemarketer will call.  I'll politely let them know that its not a good time.  10. we may go to the YMCA pool based on how many good decisions everyone makes.  11. Mommy will return from bringing home the bacon and we will take a family walk around the circle.  hope your day is full of:   peace~

      It’s a claim I made a few posts back and I wanted to talk about what I meant.    I think to own your story, you have to tell stories.   Good news:  anecdotal party banter  does  encourage such telling.  BS sessions which fall under the general headings:   “remember the time when…”   and   “you think that  that’s  bad!…”  are, I think, one of the great vestiges of oral culture left threading through humanity.  I think that this tradition is great – it fits in well with deipnosphistai (below).  I’ll wager that if you know someone who you would say – “So-and-so is a great storyteller.” – that they are experts in the two genres mentioned above.   So my complaint is not that these stories are bad (again, they’re GOOD!) but that they’re insufficient.    Somehow we relish opportunities to swap these stories (which generally affirm collectively held values, demarcate micro-cultural boundaries, and reinforce shared criteria for evaluating humor / art / performance) – but turn to the movies or novels or church or the newspaper – to hear stories that raise and answer the bigger questions of meaning and morality.  We lack, it seems, opportunities to tell  our  stories.  And in some ways, I think, maybe its okay that we don’t always tell our dark stories to just anyone or to everyone.  Most of us tell these stories to a few people and that’s hard enough as it is.  But there’s a middle ground.  Another place.  A point-of-view, a way-of-seeing, a way-of-being – which both enables us to tell the big stories, but also preserves the delicacy of intimacy and the dangers of disclosure.  It’s called:   Fiction.   I’m convinced that honing your skills as a creator of  fiction   is  a way to own your own Story.  And your own stories.    Are you skeptical?  Delighted?  Nonplussed at my rantings? There’s only one good response to reading this blog.  Use your imagination and tell one fiction story today.  To someone.  See what happens to you….  Peace~

       *note: the end of the world has been postponed. this world, that is.  the showing date has been moved back several months.  just one more long boring story summarized under the metanarrrative of: Technical Problems.   Some of you read that title and panicked: “I turned that paper, didn’t I?  I graduated already.  I had to turn it in…they can’t revoke my diploma can they?”   Others recognize the title  urlLink independent study  as a short film that I’ve been talking about making for the last, I don’t know, two years?  Well the bad news is final.  After an epic number of twists and turns in the road of post-production, a death certificate has finally been issued.    Editing Problems Hard Drive Breakdowns Audio Recording Disappearing  These are the three specific chapter headings which define the long arduous (and boring-to-tell) post-production of the film that we guerilla shot in 12 days with the hard work and dedication of a fabulous cast and crew.    In the end – it turns out that the time it would take to do the necessary voiceovers and audio remixing – make it infeasible for me (or, I think, any of the other ol’ indy-study folks) to manage a final cut of this film that we could actually ship around to festivals.  BUT – I am grateful to many of you for your work and patience – AND – I’m increasingly devoted to the importance and value of ritual –  so  –  I’m going to show a not-really-perfect draft of  Independent Study  as a means to:   -reunite a bunch of fun, great people -celebrate art and artists -thank some of the vendors who donated free food (based on the promise of a publicly shown “thank you”) -give myself permission to move on to new projects  on SUNDAY, DECEMBER 12th at 9 p.m. in the evening & (probably) in the Malone College Theater.  I’m going out of town for the month of July, but I’m scheduling now so that those of you who think of passing this on to other indy-study-folks who I may have lost touch with – can pass it along to them.    It will be an event that will be open to the public – but at no charge – I’ll be using copyrighted music in this not-quite-a-real-draft-of-a-movie.  So the official word will be:    This is a big gathering of friends to watch a movie they made together.  Hopefully the RIAA won’t pick up on our sinister little non-money-making plot and name us as co-defendents along with their host of 6 year old Kazaa users…  Sorry to those of you who aren’t in the  urlLink independent study  loop for taking up bandwidth….you’re welcome to come to the party, too!  peace~

      The world makes insistent demands.  Maybe alarm clocks must BUZZ – BUZZ – BUZZ over and over again to wake us from the free-association world of dreams in order to lay a sense of foreshadowing across all that is to come in the day ahead.   Because what will come will be the same thing over and over again.    BUZZ. Buzz. buzz.  I went to Michigan’s Adventure Land with my brother, the bishop yesterday, and spent most of the day riding carnivals of circles and speed and mountains of height and neck snaps along with a thousand other middle class sensualists.   As we took an umbrella stroller full of bags, backpacks, swimming suits, towels & a video camera back to our matching minivans in the parking lot (stuffed full of more twin minis), his cell phone rang.   It was our brother-in-law Ryan, who lives nextdoor to David in the postwar suburb full of carefully maintained cape cods, square lawns and cascading Home Depot mulch bed gardens.   Emily had escaped again.   Emily is the family beagle whose breed, apparently, predisposes her to escape from home and to run away.  For two summers past, thought their backyard had been an Eden grand enough for her liking.  But this summer….she has fallen from her idyllic original state-of-grace.   Every day there is a call or a chase or a penitent Emily awaiting them outside of the fence in the driveway as they return home.    How does our world come to torture us in these random, uncontrollable plagues?   We choose love and life.  Emily, the beautiful, mild and faithful beagle.   Love and life is full and beautiful for a season – some seasons long, some short.  Emily’s perfection lasted two years.   And then from nowhere – certainly not from our decisions – certainly not from our expectations – feasibly, but outlandishly possibly from the inheritance of Beagle Breeding and Neighborhood Fences – but who could know that such benign and recessive predestinations could so persecute us eventually?   Emily is exploring another point of weakness in the white picket fence right now – what are you up to? Buying a beagle?  Building a fence?    Enjoy the temporary –   Peace~

      A teacher from my past, given to axiomatic instruction, chided me with these words.   Today we may be engaging in a series of house transactions that we’ve been working on for a long time.   When in the midst of such interactions there are many choices to make, and Lynn and I are committed to making them together.    Making decisions  together  is one of the more difficult features of being human.  Consensus becomes truer and truer the longer you know one another, and the longer you talk about any issue.  Unfortunately, it also becomes more difficult.    In our case, since we’ve made these decisions together before, and because we like each other a lot – we know that there are unique features of each-other’s take on things that are really valuable.  But what we don’t know is which feature of which person’s personhood is going to end up mattering in the story we tell ourselves about this decision AFTER its made and completed.   We're writhing together.  My teacher used to bellow the title of this blog in the Imperative Tone – Amped Up On Steroids.  And there’s something about the level of confidence with which one says something that actually weights the credibility of the statement beyond its own merits.    Tammie has started pointing out to me that my years of debate have lent me just such a blustery tone of surety which often is attached to statements which are at best – probabilities and at worst – subjective perspectives.  Brendon and Janson and I, when we stayed up til three and four in the morning in Lawlor Hall debating the morality of going 57 in a 55 – employed this tactic of false surety with all sorts of permutations:   I read somewhere that… There’s been research done… It’s been proven…  And the best is always when you include a statistic with a very specific and esoteric number.   The truth is  (note the surety in my tone)  that indecision is not just a skewer –   It’s actually a pretty fertile ground where relationships may grow…  It’s a rupture in the sometimes stifling surety which we rely upon in the quotidian flow…  Looking for a new axiom, I invent:   Exult on the rope swing of indecision…  Dance through the gloam of indecision…  Jump into the pool of indecision…  Coast on the surf of indecision…   …if only they didn’t want landings and sunset and the solid ground of dry land…   may your indecision be full of…   peace~

      Before Jaelyn was born our lawyers advised us not to bring her home until after the forty-eight hours of maternal consent had passed.  Too many custody cases that they had seen, too many broken hearted adoptive parents, too much risk – they said – to take her home after the 12 hour wait that the hospital mandated.   In _The Great Divorce_, the narrator talks about all the reasons that humans choose to turn back to the small dark dingy city that they came from instead of growing into and up-in and through live in the dangerously beautiful new world.  One of the stories he tells is of a mother who is so wrapped up in the lives of her children that she cannot bear to let go of them so that she may enter the Great New World.  Parental love, like all the greatest parts of being human seems like one of the most dangerous and difficult endeavors.  How do we love without strings attached?  How can we possibly invest every hope and dream into these people and then love them just as fully when they need to choose dreams that we can’t understand?  I see this question being struggled through by college students who are on the receiving end of constricting love.   So we decided to bring her home anyway.  Those 36 hours felt like one of the top 5 most courageous moments in my life.  After a two month wait for her, after a miscarriage and all the brokenness that that brings, after two years of infertility.    I read  urlLink this blog  that inspired me. The question:   “What is the bravest thing that you have ever done?”  Seems like one of those questions that push us to tell some of our best stories – look for what we admire mostin each other – and become something more courageous than we are…  peace~

        its vacation -- shouldn't i have more thoughts simmering than time to write them on a blog?   1. shouldn't libertarians *want* the government to stay out of regulating marraige?  + if Christians believe (a la Romans 1) that Jesus calls people unto himself by revealing himself throughout the world *&* if marriage is the best metaphor for God's consumation of his love for us *then* doesn't it make sense that *encouraging* gay marraige would allow everyone who partook in that part of God's truth to be led even closer to Jesus?  (Do you think I may still have a career with Focus on the Family?)  2.what if everybody thought that part of the legacy they left for their world was some stories.  Some people would continue the great oral tradition of storytelling, some people would blog a lot, some people would make children's books for their kids and grandkids, other people would make little movies.  And if we started thinking of *our* stories as reconsistituting a seam between our selves and the *place* worlds we lived in -- then even this little books and stories and movies and songs would have audiences...  3. i'm mostly a *post* evangelical because i'm so desperately concerned that the evangelistic / missional impulse to *get it right* and to *convince* an audience makes every story go south.  It chokes out the ambivalences that all good stories need.  4. I'm feeling like all my marxism and critical theory is making me feel too heavy about the world.  that my stories (particularly the dark play that i'm currently trapped inside) have been too sincere.  I love the flitting, easygoing COMIC FRAME that my Grandma Marge and Grandpa Andy use to talk about their complex and difficult lives.  And I think that maybe I need to write an essay where Grandma Marge and the narrator of "Unbearable Lightness of Being" hash it out.  Because unlike Tomas' lightness, my Lampiris family heritage is rooted in great tragedy *&* laughter.  And unlike the surrealists exisistential irony, the Lampiris laughter is always both self-effacing & heartily *with*...  5. I leave for *the cabin" in one day.          "Treasure Island" (its other name) has been one of the deep resources of continuity and peace in my life, and when our family talked about the eventual possibility of being forced to sell it -- we argued about the merits of using profits to invest in a new family cottage (more accessible)? and honor Grandparents Rudds that way OR -- my dad suggested -- what about the horrific poverty of the world and our relative wealth?  Could we invest that profit in a way that would satisfy more people in more diverse ways?  It's the question of Mary Magdelene's absurd perfume performance art -- abject generousity VS. settling in the post-babylonic Jerusalem and "planting gardens" -- investing in the systems that will provide long term resource for the Kingdom and world?

      Lynn and I had a weekend rendezvous at a little hotel that we've returned to regularly since our first stay 12 years ago during our honeymoon.    when we got back to Gramma Glo & Bampa Bill's house where the kids had been staying and playing with their cousins --   urlLink     Patty (a longtime family friend) had arrived to provide Jaelyn and Addison one of the highlights of their vacation...   urlLink      urlLink     a ride on her Harley...  otherwise we've been:   1.) celebrating hundreds of birthdays,   2.) building a huge fence,   3.) reading a (very) little,   4.) swimming a (very) little.  5.) chillin with Aunts, Uncles & Livermores.  &   6.) looking forward to heading north to the cabin next week...  in completely unrelated news, but utterly worthwhile to think about...  More info (including pictures) about  urlLink The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe  has been released.

      my friends cliff and mary (and Jack!) are visiting right now.  I just love them, and wish y'all could know them, too.    Back in the day Cliff and I used to tell stories to each other over frenchfries in the student union at BGSU, and Mary and I brewed exotic coffees in a decrepit pit of a Teaching Assistant Office while wrestling with rhetoric, interpretation & the politics of highered...  So anyway Cliff is brilliant culture critic who recently wrote about (mark your calendars!):   urlLink Gifted  an astonishing swirl of American Dreams, Reality TV & Christianbookstormerica.  once.  when i was a fundamentalist.  I participated in a a pageant called:  Most Christian Teen.  or Outstanding Christian Teen.   or something like that.   I found it absurd, but there were scholarships available, and goshdarnit, I was a prize Christian Teen if ever I knew one.  And if I wasn't going to get any beer or sex or even movies or dancing, for that matter, than goshdarnit (oops...with that much profanity i wouldn't have stood a chance...i've become quite a pottymouth since then...) why not get some college tuition for it.   One of the things that cracks me up about what we used to say to condemn Catholics was that -- "everybody knows that their faith is just 'cultural'."  As if that was a bad thing.  As if ours wasn't.  Indeed the *culture* of evangelicals is beautifully satired in the movie --  urlLink SAVED .  (if you missed it, you'll have to wait for video, as distribution is waning.)  and Cliff closes his piece on GIFTED -- essentially an "american idol" for the TBN set --  with a quote:    “That’s our ultimate goal,” said McIntyre, “to put attention on the Christian world.”   his technique:    God gives us so many gifts, but we reach for the one with the prettiest wrapping. In a world where MTV dictates trends and pop-stars become idols, Christianity seems to be wrapped in conditions and judgments. It is our goal to wrap God’s message—His love—in acceptance, and in a way that blends seamlessly into ‘pop’ culture while still upholding the values we, as Christians, value most. When presented with this gift, wrapped tightly in respect, we hope that today’s youth will open the trendy packaging to release God’s love—and realize in doing so that we are all truly ‘Gifted.’   So you should expect that America's next "Gift" will be a 300-something pound somebody with acne, right?  but the show's great production values will make us realize that God's gifts of love and acceptance blends seamlessly with pop culture's gifts?  right?   You know that I love the gifts of pop culture, right? And am all for featuring the immanence of Christ and the Gospel in the cultural milieu -- but the thing is --  the "christian world" that McIntyre wants to feature is a cultural hybrid where every consumer trend is hastily baptized, blessed & pressed into the service of evangelism -- without considering how good or ill the fit may be...  everytime Jesusness becomes a product you can buy -- somebody, somewhere, is trying to serve God & mammon at the same time.  i know that Mammon happily accepts their fruity sacrifice...

      okay.  I'm coming out.   *clears throat*  no, not  that  coming out.  not in  today's  blog....  I'm making it a matter of record that i am a  democrat .   no surprise to most readers...shocking to...? nope, nobody, *but* hailing from the ronald-reagan-republican-christians that I do, I'm aware that politics is sticky point for a number of my readers today.   the point of today's revelation is to:   1. commend the democratic party for choosing to highligh / engage Howard Dean's rhetoric that what's *important* about being a democrat is *commitment to democracy*.  -- and that this commitment to democracy means that educational reform is rooted in DEVELOPING people's sense of agency, voice and participation, instead of punishing those who do not already have these privileges (eg.  "failing" schools in the "no" [rich] child left behind policy...)  -- that this commitment to democracy means participating in the kind of foreign policy that puts constraints on multinational corporations and multinational political organizations and the industrial-military-complex in favor of DEVELOPING the rights, privileges and opportunities of workers and underpriveleged people around the world  -- and that this commitent to democracy means protecting the rights of marginal populations so that they have the ability to DEVELOP their sense of agency, opportunities and contribution to society instead of *targetting* them to preserve the safety and security of the already-privileged (eg. Bush vs. Affirmative Action, Bush-tries-to-make-gays-constitutionally-inferior)  2. excoriate the democratic party -- as well as the rest of the politico-industrial-complex -- for failing to adopt *real* campaign reform which would allow for choice and heterogeneity to flourish *throughout* a political campaign -- instead of foreclosing the pool of candidates as early as possible (for both parties) in order to divorce the political process from grass roots deliberation and transform it into even more sloganeering and bumpersticking.  i *do* blame the media-indusrial-complex largely for this quandary, and i *do* (perhaps naievely) register *hope* for decentralization, dialogic media with the advent of digital / wireless / and networked media...

      Lynn turned me on to this book that we’ve both been loving this summer – James Paul Gee – writes about   urlLink social linguistics and literacies   which is situated exactly at the intersection of our interests (she researches / teaches about adolescent literacy).  So anyway he has these great labels for concepts that have circling in this blog (and in my discourse) for a long time.  He talks about that language use is always rooted in motivations of STATUS and SOLIDARITY:     Status and solidarity are the competing, conflicting and yet intimately related fields of attraction and repulsion within which all uses of language are situated.   And then he goes on to probe how indicative your use of the oral –in’ or –ing demonstrates which of these dialectical poles you’re featuring more in that particular speech episode.  If you’re endin your words with the “n” – than you’re seeking solidarity – with the “g” – you’re positioning yourself for status.  Now use of this code (or any other linguistic criteria) is dependent upon your social circle, because there are many circles where the use of the “g” is a bid for SOLIDARITY and STATUS.    But these two poles do  again  mark out the powerful opposing urges to be a part of something (to be “in”) and the urge to be unique (“be yourself, no matter what they say…”)  And this feels like a particularly keen truth when it comes to the point that Nathan makes in his blog:    Can one really affect the world one person at a time? That is just not good math. […]In order to change the world, you must be able to affect systems. In order to affect systems you must have the backing of institutions. In order to get backing you have to sell yourself to something. I dabbled in everything in college; track, choir, drama, residence life, debate etc...but I liked everything so i did not sell myself to anything. Consequently I have not affected any systems.   To have cache you have to (as Mandy puts it) “sell out” , but to make real change – to subvert the rottenness of existing status – you have to be able to maintain a sense of seperateness…  so many implications...

      We were walking home from the plastic green playground at our neighorhood school last night.  It was a cloudy cool perfect night to be pushing our now-too-heavy-to-push stroller through the streets of suburbia…  And I noticed that someone was sitting in her parked car in her driveway.    I cycled through the possibilities:  she’s a stalker.  She’s crying because she doesn’t want to go in.  She’s crying because she’ll never go back in again. She’s numb and exhausted and can’t believe that her life has been reduced to sitting here.  In this car.  In this driveway.    And I realized that this image.  A person sitting in a parked car has a powerful inonicity.   Dr. Don Enholm used to tell us in graduate seminars on classical rhetorical theory about his weekends.  His wife perused antique malls all over the state of Ohio while he sat alone in the car reading the latest treatise on the Nuremburg Trials.   Sometimes when I found myself sitting in a parking lot, waiting, I wondered what it would be like for your life to eventually simmer down to a quiet read in an obscure back parking lot.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman just sat through most of  love liza  in his car while I watched it last week.    Wasn’t it Julieanne Moore's character who was sitting in her car singing in Magnolia?  I tell my kids that the “evil robots, programmed to destroy us” from  urlLink Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots  (one of their all-time favorites songs / albums) are probably cars.  Cars are robots I tell them.  And I hate car culture especially as I snake North on Cleveland Avenue for three miles of strip malls, car mechanics and fast food on the way home every day from work.    But I also get what it is to just feel okay about sitting.  Staying.  For a while at least…in your car.  When we take long trips with the fam in (the cleverly named) “Minnie” the minivan, we call it our “Shell.” And I like that metaphor for how cars offer us a bit of shelter.  We need it sometimes, don’t we?  Our human skin is so soft?  A bit of armour in a weary driveway or parking lot or metered spot is like a quiet breath of (slightly polluted) air.  Once -- before kids got kidnapped in Malls and before stalkers hid under the cars of wary shoppers in urban mythic parking lots -- my mom would leave eleven-year-old me and my two brothers in the car, sitting in the parking lots of malls.    On one of these days, I finally had had enough of waiting.  My two year old brother was crying and whining so I buckled him into the stroller and the three of us made our way carefully into Sears.  We were all crying or red eyed by the time we were inside and we announced to a store clerk that we had lost our mother.   But I think we had just lost our sense of being.  People can only sit in parked cars for so long.  No matter how much we need them to survive  May all of your parked cars be purged of suffocation and fill you back up with –  Peace~

      my grandmother Linda named our family cottage Treasure Island.  She was well-read, and so, I'm sure intended to make allusions to the novel of the same name, but I'm thinking that the name was primarily rhetorical in nature.    Rhetorical mostly because Treasure Island isn't.  An island, that is.  The cottage itself is located on a peninsula of land that juts out from a vast woods and is surrounded by a marshy lagoon and a labyrinthian creek.  So why name a non-island, "treasure island?"  My paternal grandmother grew up (as did my paternal grandfather) on an Island.  Drummond Island, more specifically -- the largest fresh water Island in the North America.  She was the daughter of two Finnish emigrees, but grew up in a house full of siblings, no mother in the deepest woods of drummond.  She not only survived two house fires, the death of her mother at a young age, the loss of twin sibling sisters (who were adopted by other families on the island), a difficult stepmother (because of whom, she and her five siblings went to live in a seperate house where they would await visits from their over-worked father visiting his two families), but then went on to earn a high-school and college education by housecleaning and babysitting for mainlanders.   I didn't find out how difficult my grandmother's life was until late in adolesence.  She was a master-story-teller who described in great detail the idyllic childhood she re-membered on Drummond Island.  Running barefoot through vast open meadows, chasing cows with strange exotic finnish names, rolling in the snow after sitting in the Sauna, laughing garrulously with her siblings and father as they sat next to a cozy warm woodburner.  She may be one of the first bloggers to influence me.  Even though she never once "connected" to the internet. Her weekly "Dearly Beloved" letters circulated to family, extended family, family friends, and missionaries around the world.  They chronicled daily life, philosophical musings, aesthetic contemplation, and memorializing yesteryear.    But the greatest memorializing she did was the careful crafting of Treasure Island.  More than just the name, the presence of she and my grandfather benevolently haunts every square inch of the land and cottage.  Everything we did and do while we're there have been passed on to us by them and by my parents who learned it from them.    Building Fires,  Roasting Marshmellows,  Fishing from the boat,  Fishing from the dock,  Wading in the shallows,  Swimming through the bullrushes,  Building minnow traps out of huge stones,  Hunting for Geode treasures,  Discovering Crayfish and Clams Hiking through woods,  Climbing rocks,  Building forts,  Climbing trees,  Reading in Hammocks...  All the time for stillness, meditation, reflection helps open me up to the  urlLink psychogeography  of the place....  And I always hope that as I return to my work and the rhythms and cycles of everyday that I can retain some of that wonder, that curiousity, that nostalgia, that hope that reverberate around being at Treasure Island...  peace~

      ...writing a blog about how I feel.   Which is not, typically, directly what I write about.    So probably, you should not read it.  Probably it will bore you.   Probably, later, when I realize that I've been more self-disclosive, or simply too rambly, I will regret this post and remove it.  So -- probably, if you want to read a blog which will very probably be ephemeral -- you should check this blog out.   So I'm at this academic conference where people are making all kinds of short films:  documentaries, narrative films, experimental films, animation...  Good stuff.  Stuff I like.  Stuff which may or may not get seen by anyone except the classes at the particular film school where the film got made and here at this conference which is full of films that will not get seen by enough people.   A year ago, half a year ago, something like that, I sort of said:  You know what, self? You're probably not going to have a second career in Hollywood...and maybe that's okay.  Given what careers in Hollywood typically look like and what a purist you are about the kinds of stories you would not like to tell:  A hollywood career would probably not be the place for you.   Besides, self, you have a good career that allows you to make little films for small audiences and even spend some of your professional energies developing creative projects.  You should *embrace* the goodness of that opportunity.   And I'm trying to do that -- but there's another part of me -- a complex part that's motivated by ugly ambition, an evangelical / missional zeal and a profound discontent with the way-things-are...  that makes me want to spend my life energies making change.  doing something to make the world really significantly better.   My friend Matt says that its the profound desire to MATTER.  And as I moved through graduate school people kept affirming my academic writing saying that I'd make a great academician.   But three parts of me felt ambivalent about such praise.  PART ONE:  The preachers kid who won Preacher Boy Contests who had his hand pumped incessantly in the church foyers by goodhearted wellwishers who praised him saying: “I just know you’re going to be a good preacher, just like your daddy. “  PART TWO:  I secretly still wanted to make movies or write books or something…   PART THREE: I had a deeply rooted and abiding suspicion in the frequent isolation of academic discourse from real pragmatic issues…and thus, felt ambivalent about how much I wanted to commit my life to gaining the STATUS and SOLIDARITY needed in the discourse – world of Academic Writing.   So…I decided I’d give myself a few years to see if I could gain sufficient VOCABULARY and VOICE in some creative writing venues and make a difference / matter by doing that work.  I (capriciously) set a deadline of 35 years old to have achieved said mastery and after that, I said, I’d try to employ other gifts.  Ones that had been affirmed by people in the worlds I live in.  And see if I could still make a difference or matter in Academic Circles.  So I’ve been feeling like I could back away from that dichotomous thinking (lately) by embracing BOTH my academic career *&* creative work completed on a smaller scale for smaller intended audiences.   So then when today I was struck by the relative isolation of this audience….of these films…I had this flood of conflictual emotions again.   My friend Jay suggests that American Higher Education and especially evangelical schools are too influenced by the Missionary Impulse.  (You know – one way to quantify how you matter is by holding up the pelts / souls that you’ve managed to collect during your tour of duty -- )  And so I  feel …a little confused.    I suspect that such liminal speculation by a man in his mid-thirties – and entrenched in multiple institutions is a little – well, boring.    And I’m absolutely certain that such public navel gazing by a man at any age is – well, dull.  So I’m off to fraternize at the Toledo Zoo with filmmakers from all around the country…maybe I’ll bump into someone with some big answers there…  Peace~

      I’m in Toledo at the University Film and Video Association Conference.   (Ohio, not Spain…)  I’m looking forward to, tonight, seeing a film called:   “Licking English.”   Seriously.

      Step one of our landscaping resolve: I develop a course in map making where Jaelyn and Addison and I measured the dimensions and borders of the whole property in order to make a to-scale map of the entire place and plot out a long-term plan.   In order to create some incentive for the task, I framed our map-making quest inside of the King / Princess / Prince game/alter.reality that we were already playing.    ME: We need to venture forth from the Castle and measure the borders of our Kingdom.  We shall make a great map…  PRINCE HEINRICK: (played by Addison) A big one?    ME: Yes, a big map,  So that we…  P. H. : A rea’y, rea’y big one map? (Addison still has no “L”s)  ME: Yes.  A really big one.  So once we have a map…  P.H.: (now the prince is hopping up and down with the every modifier) A rea’y, rea’y, rea’y big one!?!  ME: So that with our really big map, we can take better care of our Kingdom’s lands.   PRINCESS EMILY: (played by Jaelyn) But Daddy, if we go out into our kingdom, the people from the neighboring lands may see us and attack us!  (Really.  She said that they may attack us.  Is this what it means to grow up under the regime of G.W.?)  ME: Oh.  Well.  That may be true of some of our neighbors, but I’m sure that there would be many neighbors who would be very kind….we could forge alliances with them.  P. E.:  But if we clean up our borders, then the people from the neighboring countries might come into our borders.   ME: So?   P.E.:  And they might damage our possessions.  (Really.  She said “damage our possessions.”  And really?!  Where did she get this capitalist hoarding bent anyway?)  So Lynn sprayed massive amounts of poison on the borderlands of weeds and while a couple of them are saggy – I guess I’m disappointed that they didn’t respond a little more like a magic spell.  You know – all wither and brown up in one fell swoop.  Still we hack away at our weeds – hope you’re finding –   Peace~

      In other words, we’re staying.  Which is weird because we’ve been working all year to sell it.  But we know that we don’t want to have showings punctuating fall semester  so we’re pulling her off the market.    We love our house, we’ve always loved it.  We just had decided to find a house that had some other qualities that ours didn’t.  My  urlLink new life verse  is a good teaching for us to take to heart at this time:    Treasure what you have like it’s the greatest thing in the world, because if you start longing for something you don’t have – not only will you not get it, but what you have will be taken away from you.     It’s a fascinating teaching, because by taken itself it would advocate a kind of ethnocentric, status-loving, stasis-endorsing nowness, that would preclude any thought of Then or There.  And I have to admit that that’s the scariest religion I can imagine.  This teaching is: contentment.  And I’m trying to apply the principle indiscriminately to everything in my life:  my possessions, my history, my opportunities, my relationships…  Which makes it a very hard teaching. It’s a check against: Greed.  Regret. (and thus) Bitterness.  Jealousy.  Selfishness.  It does advocate a “now”ness which reverberates with  urlLink Buber’s “thou”ness …  And now, I’m walking scarily close to a bad impression of Dr. Seuss.  So like Tigers who pee to mark their territory and like artists who try to use brushes and colors to revision their worlds – we’re painting the whole house again.   Some of you know that we underwent a Beiging of the house sometime in the spring where we bled every Turquoise and Map Blue shade out of our children’s rooms in order to please the realtors / the nebulous “mainstream” housing market.  It felt like a ritual of humiliation and hegemony.  If I could have I would have played “March Slav” at the top of the stereo speakers voice.  Or “Anatevka.”     I asked Cliff and Mary and Lynn what book they’d like to write before they finish with their lives – and they all had brilliant books that they’re practically poised to write; I had nothing.  Well, I did have a huge plate of Angelo‘s homemade pasta with olives, garlic, pesto and roasted peppers.  But maybe I should write a book called  The Beiging of of America .  I have no idea what its about, but it sounds like an interesting title, eh?  We’re also trying to “catch up” with some of the landscaping that  Casacommunitas  demands.    Can you say: rainforest?  We bought a bottle of pesticides big enough to kill both our children…And we wish we weren’t going to spray it all over the borders of the yard, but does anyone know how else to undo the fierce garden of weeds that threatens to overtake our neighbors yards as well as our own?

      well who's counting anyway?  everybody knows that i have an extraordinary gift for saying the wrong thing at the right time.  I was just talking to Kerrie about how it is to revel in your children's newfound independence the older they get.   one of the latest child-development-stages that our house is at is:   kids can get dressed on their own.   mostly.   Addison runs into more roadblocks then Jaelyn does, though.  And some of them are damnably frustrating...  for him, right now, the worst of these is:   when his underwear waistband gets folded in or back or under.  it doesn't matter which.  Addison is a bit of a purist...can't stand dirty hands, cleans up rooms on his own (sometimes) and corrects me about leaving lights on as I leave a room. So you can imagine how HORRIFYING it is to not get his underwear waistband to sit just right.  He lets out this EXASPERATED scream which you JUST KNOW is about to give way to tears or punches (depending on the tired-ometer).  But (happily) with a simple SNAP of the band....all is righted.    He laughs with an "ow!" when i snap him.  (Just think how he's going to love wedgies...)  Seems like we're all always getting obsessed over our underwear bands though, aren't we?  and then someone comes along and snaps our waistband and we sheepishly laugh "ow!" and realize how we were persevorating...  inappriate disclosure, you ask?  whence the title?  well i feel like i might be committing the ultimate PK sin -- employing my children's foibles to see the world publicly...  so if you would -- nobody mention my indescretion by blogging about his deep personal pain -- as you wish him well on his wedding day...  peace~
