      am too busy for the whole of this week.. with tuition, work and school.. tired tired tired.. so i think i havent blog for about a week.. too occupied with stuff.. cant even have the time to meet up with my darling friends.. wonder how are they now? (*ponders*) so it's another sunday.. and work is going to start on a new week.. i hope i can still cope with this packed schedule..   my work is great, i guess.. haha coz i have been doing translation work.. from chinese to english and then from english to chinese.. imagine it's a two way translation.. because my current job scope will be touching on alot of chinese.. will be doing internal audit in overseas accounts after my training in the company.. guess i'm really given a very rare opportunity to start my career.. am really very very grateful.. :) and the working days are 5 1/2days.. sat is even taken up.. followed by a class in the noon at 2pm.. went for the 3rd session of the class yesterday.. dozed off for a few mins.. haha... sleepy me! the class i'm attending now is advanced taxation.. hmm.. am now starting to worry for my results.. my 2.4-2.6.. these 3 papers... i only have confidence to clear 1 paper.. gosh.. think i'm dead this time.. i hope when the results is out, i'll be able to clear at least 2 papers.. (just keep my fingers crossed now) :T  yah.. went for kelvin's friend's chalet last weekend.. it was great and enjoyable.. never had such an enjoyable one.. and got to know his friends better too. :) esp the bbq food was superb.. we had bbq for 2 nights.. and dear dear made burgers on the last night.. wow.. the meat patty was really nice also.. even without the bread.. i can really just eat the meat patty.. haha.. :P (*drools*)   i think my supervisor who is from China, she is really nice to me.. because she keeps asking me to rest if i'm tired doing the translation work.. guess she is pampering me.. haha.. very motherly like what dear dear has described her.. and it is really true.. :)  now my dream is to save lots lots of money so that i can visit dear dear in france next time.. really gonna miss him lots..   that will be all for my past week..  shall update when i'm free.. :)

(i'm really feeling very bad) i did that because i needed to return car to mum by 7.30pm so i was rushing to get home in time.. somemore bukit timah road always has traffic jam.. sighs.. yesterday's evening was not a good one.. on my way home, i cut into the lane of a learner's car.. kenna scolded by dear dear.. :( sorrie.. above mentioned was my wednesday.  as for tuesday,  - tidied up room after the blackout - went to clementi to meet dear dear.. but made 3 trips to clementi.. because dear   dear needed to go home to get his stuff..  - paid my parking fine ($30)  - killed a cockroach  - missed my day at daycare centre  am going for another tuition later at 3pm.. yawns.. =)  current background music: God will make a way
