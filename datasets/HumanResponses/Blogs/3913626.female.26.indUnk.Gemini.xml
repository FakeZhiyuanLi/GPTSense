          urlLink    I was pretty ok on Sun (25 July)...          I had my 1st driving test on Mon nite( 26 Jul)  urlLink    ...my instructor William was ok, he taught me hands on...cool man 1st time i drove a car but rather panicky...cant help it rite...i reached home ard 9.30pm...had my supper with huby and yes i had my mom inlaw's nasi briyani with chicken curry...yummmy tasted good...i kinda of sleepy after that....i excused myself to sleep....& that'z where the episode of my worst nightmare began...         "Suddenly I felt heartburn at my chest n rite side area....itz like gastric pain symptom...i ran through my back area too...i thot i having diarrheoa...went to the toilet...goodness i just cant bear the pain as it got more worst n worst..i was thinking God gonna take my life soon...i rolled, squatted on the floor....my vision got blurred, im shivered, felt so chilled...i managed to open the door n crawled out ...called hubby a few times, he was so shocked to see me in that condition...i told him pllllssss call the ambulance, i cant take it any longer...plssss call now....it's killing me...poor hubby, he got into such panicky situation...he called mom but she was too tired to hear him out....i just told him call the 995 straightaway..dun waste anymore time...at the moment he called it straightaway n helped to clear up the mess as i vomitted earlier on....he helped me to dress up properly as the paramedic is approaching soon...guess what the paramedic is my old classmate..what a coincidence..he happened to stay nearby my block too...15 mins later we reached Changi Hospital n the doctors gave an injection to ease the pain n put me under observation for a while....i was rather pissed off when nothing was done to me aft more than 2 hrs...i asked to go home instead...well the pain subsided n i was given 3 days MC..."           urlLink           27 July                  I slept at mom's place since huby was too afraid if i encounter the pain again...i didnt manage to bring Ryn to her medical appt...Pin was kind enough to take half day to go instead with Mos...Ryn got slight fever aft her 3rd jab...but she's a strong baby...i bet she be fine soon....i was feeling rather uneasy at nite...took the medication but soon aft, i vomitted ...goodness i guess i gonna get the pain again...  urlLink           urlLink

         I thot everything was normal when i gone back to punggol yesterday...it's was pretty ok 4 me but came midnite the 'gastric pain' attacked again ...it was sooooooo annoying...i cant do anything still...huby was sleeping soundly...ryn too...i didnt know what to do...kept on rolling on the mattress..till i cant handle it any longer...i woke up hubby but he told me applied medication....i did that...goodness...i can felt the sensation through my backbone as well...i didnt know what i ate wrongly...&nbsp;    urlLink            &nbsp;           &nbsp;     i called up Mos n Pin...they came over...n hubby n Pin sent me to overnight clinic at Hougang...goodness the consultation alone is $77 ..including medicines altogether $108...cut THROAT ah...i wanted to back out at 1st cos it's too damn expensive...i wld rather suffer till nxt day than to hv pay that amt..but hubby was too determined to get me treated as he has to show statement frm the doctor to his supervisor..apparently his supervisor wont grant him leave on that day..but hubby managed to fight out with him at last...doctor took my urine test to detect if i have stone in my kidney...THANK GOD, it's not...just some food allergy i suppose...           &nbsp;     when back home, took the medicines...feel much better..OH PAINNNN..pls dont come again....&nbsp;    urlLink            &nbsp;           urlLink

       True enough...i got the pain again early aftnoon (28 July)...i knew Mos cant do anything to help me cos she has to look aft Ryn...waited 4 huby...i asked to send to Tan Tock Seng Hospital...waited there like hell ...imagined frm 3-5pm for observation...doctor gave a jab n told that they had to send me to Changi instead as my records are there...so Pin accompanied me by ambulance ... i had to be admitted soon aft...i just cant think of anything..my mind was blocked...i was thinking of my baby, Ryn...how she's doing etc...too many things on my head at the moment...i thot i was dying already...i just prayed hard for God to spare my life...i just dont know what was i thinking or hoping for...i guess this is what happened to sick ppl...they just wished whatever they can hope for...    Huby n Pin accompanied me to the ward ..it was almost 8pm...i was so depressed knowing that i hv to stay there likely 4 a few days more...how am i to cope...beside labour ward, i had nv been warded like this before...ard 10pm, huby came back again with Busu n Ila....Noi was there too ...she came aft her aftnoon shift...she was very sad that i cant make it to her wedding ... she's very sure of it...aft they left, i went to sleep as i was too tired during the day.
