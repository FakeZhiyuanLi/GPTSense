       Well, this is going to probably be the only post nobody reads, unless everybody goes back. I have never actually posted in my blogger as of the year 1999. I didn't even have a computer back then!  Anyways, I got bored so I decided to alter the post time of this one. Weird eh? I can even make it post way into the future! It's good stuff. Like a reminder type thing.   This one has no point, and I don't know why you can even post in the past. But for you  Colin's Life  freaks, let's see if you can find this one.  Talk to you all later.

       Well (I'm not sure if you guys get bored of that word; it's just my catch phrase. I feel really weird when I don't write it.), today was totally awesome. I had some pretty freaky dreams last night. I can't even remember them any more, but they were very odd. I woke up at about 8 or so. I think that Chris woke me up, he wasn't really happy in the morning. Took a shower, all the essentials, than I walked down to church. I guess my walking to the church is kind of a time to wake up in the mornings (and I suppose the glass of Mountain Dew didn't help), because when I got to church, I was a bit on the hyper side.   Let's see, I got into Sunday school. We were going through Proverbs today. I just noticed, I would probably like that book.  Wow, three sentence paragraph. After church we went out to lunch. It was one of my friends birthdays and we went to Chevy's to celebrate. I didn't eat anything, except their chips. I like their chips because they make them hot, and it tastes great. All they need to do is put salt on it by default. It would be so much more convienent. We talked a bit and then the whole gang, Nick, Sam, Dominique, Carlos and I all went to Lake Del Valle. Our church went there for a picnic and it was lots of fun. I am now a human towel, apparently. A little girl that we were watching while they were swimming forgot her towel. So I let her ride on my back while we walked up to the site. My back was all wet from that, but the little girl said it would be refreshing, and I have to admit, she was right.  Towards the end of the time being there, Dominique and I were talking to my dad. My dad asked her when she was coming over next, and she told him next Sunday. My dad had no problem with that. I couldn't believe it. It would have taken me much longer to convince my dad. So now I get to be with Dominique the day before our 1 year anniversary.   Anyways, I am pretty much done now. I don't think I can think of anything else to say. I might get distracted and leave in mid-sentence. I think I will go call...

       Well, I am starting to work on my new about me website. I am calling it  urlLink Mind Set . Eventually I will have a link up on the left. Most likely once I feel like it. Right now I am looking for a place where I can download classical music midis and put on my website.   When I am done with at least the music page, I will put it up for you guys. I will also put up a friends page. If you want to be on it, you only need two things. To be my friend, and have a life. Well, that should narrow it down to a few people. Talk to you all later. Goodbye.

       Well, today was pretty good actually. I skated down to Loard's and got lost on the way there. I found it eventually. I stayed for like an hour and pretty much just walked Dominique work. It was kind of funny. Everytime she was done serving someone, someone else came in the door! Earlier we found a babysitter for my brother, so now I can go to the church picnic tomorrow.  Now, as my regular readers know (which is like 6 or 7 of you) I do a lot of web page design. If you didn't know that: I do a lot of web page design. Up until now, it would always be about one of my hobbies. Well, I am actually going to get a page just about me. It won't have much on it. I might add a message board or a guest book. It will probably be just about some of the thinks I think or the things I do. Maybe it will have a few music files on it, for your listening pleasure or maybe, if I can get the proper software, it will have one of my originals played by me. Techincally, I could do that now, but it wouldn't be played by me, just written. Maybe I should add a HTML page. Dedicated to helping the less fortunate learn that HTML coding is very very fun! Who knows, maybe this could be as big as  urlLink Lissa Explains it All .

       Well, let's see. Today: Woke up, went down to the library. Didn't have the book I wanted, put it on hold. Came back, dad showed me that I could put it on hold at home. Didn't really matter, since I'm just going to walk down there everytime. It's not a total waste of time, only 15 minutes of it. Decided to stop using proper grammar for today, as you may already know. Losing mind, finding it, than losing it again. Talk to you later, goodbye.

       Well, I spent the better part of 5 or 6 hours messing up my blog, than fixing it again. It turns out it's a little problem with the code. That's why I like being able to write source-code as opposed to using a " W hat  y ou  s ee  i s  w hat  y ou  g et" HTML editor. It feels like cheating for me. The teacher told me I could just write it using source-code. In fact, she said later, we won't even be able to use the WYSIWYG. That will work out handsomely for me, since I've never really used them in the past, and don't intend to in the future. Well, that's probably all for today, or now at least. No school tomorrow. Actually, that makes me a bit sad. I like "A" days (periods 1-4). Those are my easiest classes, and the days I get out at 1:30. Well, I have to go train my Ninja Ferrets to take out the Evil Bunnies (that was for you Kelly, in case you are reading). See ya!

       She's gone. This must have been the first school day in a long time where we didn't see each other. I hope you guys can bare with me while I sort this out. If I don't seem like myself in person, I'm really sorry. I lashed out at a few of my friends by mistake (by lashing, I mean walking away without saying anything). I know that only one of them probably reads this. I am sorry to all four of them. They are pretty much my only friends at Livermore and it's really hard because none of them are going through as much as I am. My day could have gone better today. I can't imagine it going worse. The peak of my day was talking with Dominique though. She makes me feel a lot better, no matter what the case. Talk to you guys later. I will be online, but I will be more in pensive mode, than Colin mode. Please, if you want to talk online, I'm all ears, but don't try to cheer me up. The only thing right now that could cheer me up is if I forgot all about this. Since that's not going to happen, it really isn't any use.

       Well, today was, for the most part, a bad day. Only because of one thing. One of my best friends is moving to Portland, Oregon. She has been one of my very good friends since 7th grade, and we have gotten very close over the past year. This will affect me a lot. I have a lot of friends that I look up to and she is one of them.   Also today I talked with a friend that I haven't talked to in a while. She and I were in a 3rd-4th grade combination class when I was in third and she in fourth. I just found out that at that time we were both loners, and would've gotten along well.   Wow, first day, pretty good for school at least (that is, besides knowing about Jessica). My first period class (Tech Assistant), is going to be probably one of my favorite classes this year. I am so far the only PC tech they have. I was pretty muched raised using a PC, so I kind of know what to do, for the most part. Alec (my teacher) says that I pretty much need common sense to be in this class. For those of you who know me, well you be the judge of how much CS I have.   Second class of the day--Web Page Design. Half of the websites to the left (the ones under links, not the diaries) are mine. If you took a look at those, you would see right away that I am probably not going to have to much problems with that. Although, we are using a different kind of program than I normally use (in fact, we are doing something that I downright hate; I think it's ok to hate an inanimate object). We are using something called by many as "What you see, is what you get". Basically, it is whatever you put on the page, and you see put, is what is going to happen. I cannot stand that method. I think it is stupid in general. Granted, for people who are just beginning web-page design. I use the coding method, that may take longer, but it is more rewarding at the end. Just to know that you did this yourself and you had a big hand in the outcome, instead of a program doing it for you. Like I said, this is a class that's going to be easy, and the teacher wont know if I used it or not.  Third period (or block for you Granada folks)--US History. This class is the only competition for my favorite class. The teacher is one of my favorite teachers. The only problem is, techincally it won't be real competition until December or January. Mr. Wood is on millitary leave until then. The subsitute teacher said that she doesn't think that he even knows he's teaching this class (he normally teaches Geography and a class called AVID).  Fourth (although it wasn't really in this order; it went 1, 2, 3, 5/Lunch\6, 7, 4, 8...this was so that people who didn't take an 8th or a 4th could leave at the normal time) was my hardest class of all time. I had to walk all the way to Wienershnitzel and get a large fry and a large soda, than walk all the way back and eat it on campus. Man that was hard. Okay, it wasn't really hard. I was being sarcastic for those people who didn't catch it. I have a free period that time, and it was actually during the normal time I eat lunch. Since I'm a junior now, my parents are letting me leave campus.   5th class--Geometry. Man, I keep spelling this word wrong, I am going to need to permanetly infuse it in my brain. Geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry. Okay, I think I got it, I am going to put it in the middle of a sentence all of a--geometry--sudden. Dang! I still spelt it wrong. Gemoetry, that's how I keep spelling it. Oh well, hopefully I wont have to spell it that often. I must be slydexic. Anyways, this class should be fine.  Lunch--I failed this one last year. Actually, did you know that in some countries they actually give you a grade for this one. I'm not sure how it works, but it's either they grade you on how nutrionally you eat, or how much you socialize...not sure which.  6th period--English. Not much to say here, teacher is pretty cool, although he cusses, which is not something I like (in case you really know me).  7th--open.  8th--Biology. Not going to be that hard. It will have its ups and downs. The work is something I enjoy doing, well at least today. I like taking words apart and learning what different suffixes mean. Maybe, I can get so good at it, that I will just know what the word means before I have even heard it before. Work is easy, but it's often. Every class day we will have homework.  Well, my day was not going to well. Until I talked with Dominique on the phone. We talked about how are days went, and that was wonderful. I really like her guys. (S), you know it. If you didn't get that, you weren't supposed to. Goodnight everyone. Have good school days. Make good education. Get good job. Impruve splling, ad grmrmaar. Learn 2+2 does not equal Fish, no matter how many times you did it. If you are taking U.S. History, learn that if you answer everything George Washington, you can at least get an "A". Actually, don't do that, it probably won't work.

       Well, today has been a pretty good day, actually. I got to go to Loard's ice cream and get some ice cream (that's where Dominique and her mom work). Today is the last day of summer vacation. *Sigh*. I'm actually not that bugged as usual.  My friend just got a new computer game called  urlLink Tron 2.0 . If any of you have seen the movie "Tron" it's based off of that. A bit into the game you get to race on the light cycles. It's a first person shooter that I highly recommend. My friend gave me the demo. I'm going to play it after this post.  Also, today I finally mastered a really good trick on the trampoline. My neighbor (Chris) and I usually bounce on it in the hopes that we get better and better. Today I was standing on the bar, and I decided "Why not". So I faced away from the inside of the trampoline and did a backflip onto the canvas of the trampoline. It's pretty cool if it is executed properly. I also have managed to do backflips without jumping to start it off. Chris and I always try to make up new tricks. We are never satisfied with the tricks we already know.  What else did I do today? Oh, I watched "The One". I've been wanting to see it ever since it came out in theatres. Never got the chance until now. The Jennings recorded it, so I was able to watch the whole thing. I thought the ending was terrible. It didn't really make sense.  The "Colin has laughed" award goes to the same person as yesterday. Take a look at the third post in the entry three down. It's laughable. Because of this person I have also invented the "Contradictory" award. It goes to the same person.  Well, I've got a demo to play. It only has light cycle races, but those are good enough, for now. Have a great day everyone. Don't forget, "Artifical intelligence never beats natural stupidity!" (and I would know).

       Well, I have one word to say "GRR". My computer isn't being very nice. If you happen to be online at the same time I am, don't be surprised if I log off all of a sudden.  Let's see, today is the 25th day of the 8th month of the 2003rd year of the "death" of Christ. Let's see, F-Zero GX comes out today, for all of you Gamecube fans. It looks awesome, take a look  urlLink here  (it's a big movie, so I would recommend making sure your computer can take it).  Well, today someone with the name of Anonymous made me give out a new award. The "Colin has laughed" award. I will give this to someone who either got on my nerves or, (as the title suggests) made me laugh. This guy posted a comment on this blogger. If you want to see it it is in the post below this. Please, I highly recommend it. He implies that I have a boring life. Now, I really didn't need a perfect stranger to tell me this. In fact, I believe I put this on the page. Hence the title "You must be bored if you are reading this.". I have a question for my Anonymous friend if he/she happens to be reading: Why are you reading this? I thought my life was uninteresting.  Another thing: why do people abbrievate the word "you". It's not like it takes a while to type. It's a three letter word, one syllable word. I think there should be no such thing as an abbrievation to a one syllable word. Four or five syllables is a bit more understandable.  I highly recommend some of the sites to the side, they are rather interesting.  I thought this was interesting. I think I will try to do it every week. There will always be a link to the left side.    Bay:: Area  Boarding school:: Boarding party (pirates)  Riddle:: Usually easy  Hunger:: Thirster  Allergy:: My foot (it's swollen by some bite and I think I'm having an allergic reaction)  Sponsored:: Skater  Spin:: Top  Interest:: -ing  Scrabble:: 300-95 (one of my scores while I was playing Dominique)  Mold:: -y    Okay, I got my 2 cents out. By the way, if someone asks "A penny for your thoughts" and they put "their two cents worth in" where does the other penny go? Someone's making money. Goodnight everyone. Speaking of money, I got a new get rich quick scheme. All I need is a few shaved lobsters, a willing patient, and a waiver releasing me from any physical harm done to this patient. I got some lobsters to shave.

       Well, today I went to church. Since there wasn't any Sunday school I went into regular service with Dominique. It was pretty weird being there so early. Then later we worked in the special needs class. The teacher there had a magazine. Inside the magazine were two needles hidden. If you found both of them and sent it in, you could win a prize. The teacher really wanted that prize, so we both helped her look for it. It was quite interesting, considering that Dominique kept on saying she found it.   Miss you sweetie.   Yea, that was pretty much my day. I know, interesting life. Like I said before, you must be bored if you are reading this, because my life isn't really that interesting. Well, thats all for today. This is Colin, signing off.

       Well, that would explain me sitting here, doing nothing. My next door neighbors got home Thursday night, and since I was busy last night, I was over there all day today. I should probably get into the habit of writing in my journal more often.   Today has felt pretty slow to me. I haven't gotten to talk to Dominique at all today, although I know she has tried to contact me. Apparently my phone has been ringing a lot, which bothers my parents, but makes me feel really special. I'm glad that at least one person wants to talk with me.   I feel kind of lonely right now. There are quite a few people online, but with the exception of one person, they aren't people I talk to often and she happens to be away right now. I think Dominique is either working right now or babysitting.   I can't wait for school to start again. Yea, that's the first time I've ever said that, and it feels weird. I don't know why I'm excited to go back. I think it's because I got really good classes this year. I am a tech assistant for the computer lab this year. Since I love computers so much, that will be great. My second class is going to be another easy class, maybe too easy. I am in Web Page Design. I can show of my skills to the greatest magnitude here. My US History class is going to be great. I got one of my favorite teachers of all time again. I got Geometry with a really cool teacher, who just happens to look like  urlLink Steve , the old host of Blue's Clues. My last two classes are English and Biology (I keep wanting to call it biography for some odd reason). I am thinking my hardest class is going to be Biology.  I still don't know if one of my best friends is going to Granada or not. She moved near the ending of last year, but finished the year at Livermore. I will be sad if I find out she is going to Granada and didn't bother calling me to tell me.  I have deemed it next to impossible to throw a wire hanger into your closet and have it land on the pole keeping the clothes up. After 20-30 tries, I have enough evidence to back it up. I finally decided not to be lazy, and to just put it there manually.  Anyways, I think I got out a lot of things I hadn't said in a while. Thanks for listening. If you find yourself in an exastential quandry full of loathing and self-doubt, just remember that there is always a little place called Albuqurqe.

       Well, again, I haven't updated for a while. Sorry bout that. I kind of get myself lost and forget to update it. Even with the interface on my homepage, I still forget it. I think I usually just skip the main page and go to my email straight away. You know, me being as popular as I am, I got to stay current with my fans (err...I have changed the meaning of fans to be like two or three people who email me, and the rest junk mail).   Let me think.   Monday: Don't really remember what I did. Doesn't really matter anymore, seeing as it was two days ago. I know I watched Chris, because my mom started school and he ended school (ironic huh? Same day he ends it, my mom starts it).   Tuesday: Pretty much the same story, don't remember what I did, doesn't matter, watched Chris. I actually have started a vigorous training program with Super Smash Bros. Melee. I have switched my main character around. One of my friends showed me the flaws in the character I was using. I started training with someone who was really like him (from the same game in fact). I actually completed a lot more than I had with my original. For all you SSBM fans, I was using Falco, but he showed me that Fox is so much better. I might explain why he is better later.  Today: I went to a pool party with my church. As anyone reading this knows, I didn't swim, cause I can't, and I'm afraid. I jumped on the trampoline with a few friends. That was quite fun. I stood around and talked, played piano. I don't usually like playing piano, mostly because it feels like I'm showing off. I don't mind playing at recitials, because that's what I'm supposed to do. I also don't mind playing for friends who ask me specfically. Unless it's requested, and nobody else minds, I don't play.  Well, thats all folks. You know at the end of all those Loony Tunes shows where Porky comes out and stumbles over a word. Have you ever wondered what word he is really stumbling over. It starts with a "D", but I don't know what it is. Oh well, goodnight everyone.

       Well, I haven't updated for two days now. I kind of forgot, I have been quite busy. Actually the reason I didn't update on Friday was because I plum forgot. Saturday I didn't because I was doing about a million things that day. Maybe it was two things, I can exxagerate all I want. Anyways, I went to help one of my friends with something on Saturday morning. I worked the sound while she was teaching a few other people a dance they will be performing some Sunday morning. I don't know when they are doing it.   That night I had a birthday party I was going to. It was pretty fun. Well, now I have nothing really to say. I thought I would need to say a lot more things, but I was sadly mistaken. Bye all, have a great day.

       Well, today I did a significant amount of nothing. We moved some new furniture into my house, so now our kitchen looks really different. For those of you who have been in my kitchen, which isn't very many of you, my mom's desk, the tall white cabinet and the little desk with the scanner are all gone. They are now replaced by two beautiful brown pieces. One of them is a hutch that is really good looking, and the other is a sideboard. In my parents room, they replaced my dad's dresser with another dresser and pretty soon we are going to replace the kitchen table with a different one (even though we just replaced this one). We are getting all this furniture for free, so it doesn't really matter.   I read a little more in the 5th book of the Alvin the Maker series. The 5th book is called Heartfire and I'm not even halfway through it. I would like to finish that book sometime soon.   I'm playing  urlLink Scrabble  online right now. Although my opponent and I both got disconnected I am going to wait for he/she. The game is very fun, and it plays very well. The person just left the game. Oh well, I'm starting a new game now. I will be back to complete this journal in a minute.  *a minute*  Well, I think I'm getting bored of this game. I am going to play sorry once Dominique comes home (hopefully). I probably need to move back to my computer so she knows I'm actually here (I'm on my parents computer right now). I wonder how long I can make this entry. I don't know how much more I can stand of the computer I'm using. It's keyboard is less used then mine.  Much better, now I'm my own computer, without a wire. I have a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse, and it's really nice. I can type with the board on my lap. Nobody is really online right now, except Dominique, but she is away. I am so bored everyone.  urlLink E-Mail  me some interesting web-sites. I need something to during the day.   Today I finished the other Calvin & Hobbes book and now I have no more Calvin to read. I love Calvin & Hobbes. I still haven't changed out of my pajamas from last night. Summer is great, especially when I can do that. I need to find something to do. People have been telling me I don't get outside often enough, but I need some suggestions to do while I'm outside. "Walk your dog" is the only one I've gotten.  Well, that's pretty much all I have going on in my mind. Nothing is swirling around in there. Although usually, for nothing to be swirling around, something had to be in there to begin with. Oh well. Remember: To make a bad day worse, spend it wishing on the impossible.--Calvin

       Well, today has been the most eventful day of the week thus far. I went to the book oases (a really good used book store) and I got a few books. I got two Xanth books (Piers Anthony, great author) and I got a Calvin & Hobbes book (Scientfic Progress Goes "Boink". I love Calvin, he is so awesome). I think I'll end the night with another Calvin & Hobbes quote. He made an awesome statement in the book I just read, I will tell you it.   "Some people are pragmatists, taking things as they come and making the best of the choices avaliable. Some people are idealists, standing for principle and refusing to compromise. And some people just act on any whim that enters their heads. I pragmatically turn my whims into principles."   I thought that was hilarious. Hilarious enough to show all of you guys.   Also I co-led worship tonight. That went specatcular. I loved it, it was such a great experience. I got a few positive comments and no negative ones. Before everyone was making a big deal about it. "You are singing tonight?" "Colin's singing? I'm going to watch him the whole time, just to make him nervous." Alright, those were paraphrased, but I can't remember exactly what they said. I think those people never realized that I've sang on the team before. Oh well. Next week is the BBQ/Pool party. Many of you may or may not know this, but I'm a bit hydrophobic, so I don't know if I'll go. I probably will and just not swim.  After youth we all went to Haicenda Crossings (a place where The Regal theatre is) and just had some time to fellowship. It was great, I pretty much did nothing though. I ordered a basket of fries and shared it with everyone, or just about everyone. Dominique was there and thats what made it even more fun.   Well, see how eventful my day was? I got nothing left, you guys have drained me of everything. No more to read, sorry. Goodnight everyone. "To make your job more bareable, get a hobby that's worse."--Calvin's Dad

       Well, today was not very fun. I didn't really do anything at all today. Oh sure, I read. I played a bit of scrabble. I'm making dinner right now, so I won't be long, but I will type more afterwards. I am really starving. The pizza is smelling good right now, I can smell it from the kitchen to my room (I'm in the back of my house, for those of you who haven't actually been to my house, which would be a lot who are reading this). Right now I can't really think of much more to say. I ate now. I never remembered to finish this. I'll leave off with this quote. It is from a Calvin and Hobbes book. We could all use a little more of Calvin's humor, we need humor as much as possible. I'll leave off with this quote. It is from a Calvin and Hobbes book.

       Well, I feel like I'm going to throw up, and that's not something I like feeling.  I don't know why though. I drank some water, but not to much. I can't drink water, I'm weird, I don't like the taste of it.  Hopefully tomorrow my mom and I are going to go to Book Oasis (a really neat-o used book store) to get some bookage. Although I would rather go today, neither my mom nor I have any money.  Yes! I just got back from Sarah (the worship leader at my youth group) that I am co-leading worship on Wednesday. I can't wait! I am finally moving towards what I want to do with my life.  Eh, not a very long entry, I will try to do something exciting later today, I don't know what though. Remember: On the other hand...you always have five fingers.

       Well, I just got back from Target (Tarzhay if you will). I got a little notebook for myself. I plan on using it for bigger purposes than a notebook, but maybe someone will tell you about that later. Most likely it won't be me. Most likely it won't happen at all.  Now that I'm done messing with your heads. I got some root beer while I was there, and then I headed home. I decided that I should probably at least start heading that way.  I don't understand people. Why is anybody mean to anybody in this world? It seems that people generally have enough virtue not to go out and kill someone, but why is that something that could be a problem. If people got along a little bit more than they would have no need. Everyone needs to turn over a new leaf (or maybe two leafs) and just be good. I am probably asking to much.  Well, I'm done pretty much. Now all I have to think of is some witty remark to leave you guys with. Who knows what I will think of next. Eh, guess that's good enough.

       Well, I read a bit more today. Almost finished the book. I still am reading Alvin Journeyman for all those who are interested. I haven't read a lot lately and I'm starting to again. I took a drive down to Stockton at the county clerks office to get my birth certificate to take my learner's permit test. That felt like a waste of time to me. Oh well, can't undo whats already been done, although sometimes I wish I could.   All boredom and more boredom makes Colin talk in the third person. Colin is extremly bored guys. He is so bored he has no idea what to do. I just hope Colin finds something to do soon or he might as well just snap, or fall asleep, whichever is more likely to come first.   Well, that is it for now, I may or may not have more writing depending on my mood and the ratio of my "Butt in chair in front of my monitor" to my "Butt not in chair in front of my monitor". Have a great day.

       Well, I just got back from church (Sunset). It was fun. I went with Dominique, Sasha, Sara, Shannon and their respective parents. It wasn't quite the same as a regular service. One of their pastors are going to Ireland for a missionary trip, along with his wife and three kids. So, we really didn't have a sermon or anything. They had desserts (I didn't eat, wasn't hungry, not a big dessert fan). We sat at a table and talked a lot. I've always wanted to go to a church I've never been to before and pretend I was deaf. I always thought that that might be fun. I could ignore anyone I wanted to (I've always wanted to do that) and I could sign to people. Probably will never happen though.  Afterwards we went back to Dominique's house for a little while, and she and I played Scrabble. She beat me, needless to say. I really am not that good at that game, I never have been. Then I played Snood. It was funny because I beat her highest score on the first time.  Well, I know this is not that long, but I really don't have much more to say. Good night everyone...er...good morning...er...good afternoon...whenever you are reading this...so yea...bye bye...er...yea.

       Everytime I try to publish my blog I get an error that says '550 Could not open: No space left on device'. Now, that is kind of interesting to me, considering that I have seen much bigger blogs than mine and that everything still posts fine. Maybe they are having a server problem. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day today. Just thought I needed to get that out before I burst open. That is all. Okay, you can't stop reading now. You aren't listening in the slightest, I can tell. Stop reading now! I urge you to quit. Ok, you asked for it, it's your funeral.  HA! You found my secret message. Not so secret anymore.

       Well, I just got back from church. I got to see Dominique! We got to talk a lot. Her mom gave me a ride home and now, with a long string of events, I get to go to Sunset church service at 6:00!   Now, I have had this journal for little over a week, and I have to say I love how much it helps me. I have always been in need of a way to express my feelings, and this is just perfect. It is something that is easy to update, and works great with just what I need. If anybody is looking for some kind of journal editor Blogger is it. Thanks for listening everyone. I will probably be back to retell what happened at church. Let Jesus put grace, into the lack, to make a great impact.

       Well, my mom and I went to Wal-Art. We got there and I asked her where the posters were. She said she didn't know. All I said was "I hate this store". My mom said she does too. I really wish it was tomorrow. Today is done, let tomorrow come. Hey, that rhymed! Yea, I'm done.  Tomorrow I have a lot planned, and that's namely nothing. I don't know what I'm going to do or anything. I will probably end up reading for most of the time. I kind of didn't read at all today. Except for the morning, but I didn't get much in, unfortunately. I never can spell that word right on the first try, "unfortunately".   I saw this poster at Wal-Art and it had a picture of someone that looks like he could be from The Three Stooges (but he wasn't) and he has a shirt that says "College" on it. That's it, that's all. I thought it was funny, just because it makes no sense at all. I also saw the infamous "Dogs playing poker" poster  Well, as you can tell, my day has been chalk full of stuff to do. I think the most interesting thing is when I whacked my mom with the rolled up poster when she stopped and had me run into her. She stopped to fast. Well, goodnight everyone. When your up all night because you can't sleep, think about this: How can you taste the rainbow if there is no blue Skittle? That'll put you right to sleep.

       Well, I had tried to post something before, but stupid Blogger for everything wrong. I tried to publish the post and it wouldnt work.  I need to go to Wal-Art for a poster. My dad, of course, needs to get his hair cut also. So I get to wait for him to come home since we can't bring Chris with us nor leave him here.   Since I have time, I might as well tell the story of why I call it Wal-Art. I was coming back from the movies with Dominique. Her parents were driving and needed to stop at Wal-Mart. Now, I am not a big fan of Wal-Mart so I had been searching for something to call it for a long time. We pull into the parking lot and there it is, as plain as night. The lighted sign above the entrance had one letter missing. Luckily for me it wasn't the "A", because then I would have to call it Wl-Mart...or Wal-Mrt. It was the "M" making a pronouncable name.   Well, I have been looking for things to use to make my Blogger better. I want to have menus on the two sides and the posts in the middle. Like  urlLink this  Blogger. If anybody could please E-Mail or IM me what I could do, I would be eternally grateful. For now, that's it. I will return to those who wait earnestly for some more amusing (well at least semi-amusing; or psuedo-amusing) anecdotes. While you wait, think about this: What color would a Smurf turn if you choked it? Next time you meet a Smurf, give it a try and get back to me on it.

       She's back! Yay!  I'm glad your back sweetie!   Well, today I didn't really do much. I went over to 7-11 to get a Slurpee. I went to the library to get some books. Read outside. Read inside. Talked on the phone. Ate food. Took a nap. Watched TV. Played Gamecube. See? Not that much. I was really bored today for the most part. I got my report card for summer school. Now, I only took Driver's ED, but it didn't say that I got any credits for it, and it must have been a pass or fail class (I passed, of course). Other than that, I did just about nothing. Well, that's it for today. Goodnight everyone! I just have one question; Why don't they call 7-11 just plain old 18? It's the same thing...isn't it?

       Well, my mom is playing a game called Golden Sun. She can't get past any certain part of it and keeps asking me for help. It gets annoying after a little while. Also, my teeth hurt for some odd reason. I don't think I did anything to them, they just hurt. I've probably said this before, but my computer needs to be taken out back and shot. It gets on my nerves constantly because it won't stay working for longer than a couple of hours. Unless, I'm not there next to it, then it has no problems what-so-ever.  Dominique still hasn't come home  yet, but I hope she does soon.   My computer is starting to act up again. It whistles (no, not as in a melodic tune; it whistles one continous note and doesn't stop for about 10 minutes), and bugs everyone in the house. Even if I restart my computer, it doesn't stop. Oh yea, it will stop while it is rebooting, but then it starts up again; just when you think it's finished.   Well, that's it for now. Have a great rest of the day. I shall return later with more news (or lack there-of, whichever way you want to look at it).

       Yay! Dominique comes home today! I can't wait! She said she would call me as soon as she got home!  Today I woke up at about 8:00. My mom, dad, Derek and Chris were all off at work (with the exception of Chris, he's at school). I played a little golf (still haven't seen any commercials for it) and at 9:30 watched some SpongeBob. I haven't seen that show for a while, but I have seen the one that was on. After SpongeBob was over I skateboarded down to the library. That's right, I finished my book...again. I am now reading Alvin Journeyman; the fourth book in the series.  I started that and read for about an hour. I think I'm going to go make lunch now. Even though it's a bit early for it. My shelf now has two more items on it. I need to find something that will go there. It needs to be something that I would like to have easily accesible so there is actually a point to putting it up there. I guess I could put my CDs up there, but I would still have plenty of room (seeing as how I only have somewhere around 10 CDs). I think I am going to buy a CD player and put it up there and get some good Classical CDs. Well, all this "Blogging" is making me hungry. I am going to go get some food. I will fill everyone in on my day later. Remember: Two wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts do.

       Well, I looked around to see if there were any other good journal sites out there. Only one is better than this one, and I can't use it since it costs money to join, or if you get a code from a friend, which I can't (yea, it's Livejournal). I really want one that can show what the mood is with a little smiley face. I think those are nifty and easier to use. I found one that uses those, but it is very formal and not very good. I think I will do what I did above and just live without the little smiley face. I shall post in the morning, or late afternoon tomorrow. Good night everyone. Don't forget to put out any fires you may be lighting before going to bed.

       Well, a good 2 or 3 hours of solid, almost uninterrupted reading makes me very very happy. Although I found it amusing when my mom walked outside (where I was reading) and saw me having my head half off the table and half on it asking if I was awake. It kind of scared me, but I was awake. It was the best way I could think of to read. I am going to try and get out of the habit of editing my posts and just add new posts for each time I post (ack, I tried to think of another word for post...now I know, entry, oh well). I think that today was a 7 on Colin's scale of 1-10. Although the reading brought up the score, I really didn't have anything else to do. I need to find some way to show you how I am feeling for each post short of just writing it. Like some kind of emoticon that will stay there. I want to get Livejournal, but I only know one person who has it and he already gave out his code. I could pay $4 a year, but I'd rather not. If worse comes to worse and I start really liking this I might buy the ad-free version of blogger, at the very least.   Dominique comes back tomorrow! I have been so bored this week and I finally get to talk to her. Eh, nothing much more to say on that subject. New paragraph.  Well, I have just about nothing else to say. Hmm...there is a strange red mark on the back of my middle finger's knuckle and I don't know how it got there. I usually am subject to writing long accounts of my day, but this is about all I did today. I went to Safeway, got some food there (good food). Things will start getting considerably more interesting in this journal when my next door neighbors come back. Who knows what I will do when they are home. Well everyone, goodnight. When you can't sleep at night, ask yourself this: Why are there millions of laws to enforce the 10 commandments?

       Well, this just totally makes my day. I can now write a post from just about anywhere I am online. I downloaded the Google toolbar, and now whenever I have just visited a site that I think is totally awesome and you guys should all see, all I do is click this little button, and a window pops up with a post information for my journal. You guys probably aren't as excited as I am, but it helps me a lot. Well, that's all I wanted to tell you. Remember, no matter how hard you try, you can't lick your own ear.   *EDIT*  Well, my mom and I just got my shelf up. Now I have extra room. The problem is I've grown so accustomed not to having a shelf, that all I have up there are my GBA (Game Boy Advance) games, some change and a movie that isn't mine. I assume that eventually some of my books will go up there. I will probably put things that I don't have room for down here next to my computer.   Well, I am extremly bored right now. I am done moving things around my room (for the most part). I probably will clean my room; yea I'm weird, I like cleaning my room. I do it without anybody asking me too. If my room is messy I can't ever find anything. Have a great day everyone. Remember, if life gives you lemons, throw the lemons back at it; you don't know where they've been.

       Well, everyone, today's journal post is going to be cut a little short. I had been typing for the half hour prior to this post. I was just ending my post with my normal witty remark, when I decided to check my email at the same time. I mant to open up a new window, but it didn't quite work that way. I apoligize for all of you who were waiting with their tounges drooling to see what would happen next in the life of Colin "The man, the myth, the legend". I will tell you tomorrow. Good night everyone. Remember "Only you can prevent forest fires."--famous last words of Smokey the bear after really finding out why his name is "Smokey". Sleep tight. Can anyone give me the definition of sleeping tight? I really would like to know so I actually know what I'm saying to everyone when I say this. I will type up a full account of my day tomorrow morning, when I am not pissed off at my computer anymore. Good night everyone.    *EDIT*  Well, it's about 2:00 PM the following day, but that doesn't mean I can't give you a recount of yesterdays events. Here it goes.  I woke up and walked out to the living room, my dad was playing Mario Golf. Yea, everyone says I'm lucky. "Your parents play Nintendo? Wow, your lucky." All it means for me is that I have to fight for the GameCube every once and a while. My dad left for work and I played for a little while. Then I got bored and decided to read for a little while.  Reading update: In the past few days I have read 2 and a half books. I started out with reading Seventh Son. Then sometime yesterday I finished Red Prophet (the second in the series of 5 or 6 books). Now I am reading Prentice Alvin and I am already halfway through (after starting it a few hours before youth last night). I read fast and I read a lot.   I finished the book and went to Funcoland (a really cool video game store an overall 10/10 on the Colin scale) and we looked around for some games. I think this was the second time I walked out of that store without having bought anything. Well, I did reserve a game for 5 bucks (Viewtiful Joe, awesome game, I've played the demo). The first time I didn't buy anything was when I was out there at the Regal (a movie theatre right near-by) with Dominique (I miss you so much! (L)). Well, I really wanted to get Mario Golf. So I we went back to Livermore (Funcoland is in Dublin, some 15 odd minutes away). We stopped at Target and there it was in all its splendidness and awesome power. Mario Golf. Now I'm the kind of guy who would buy the guide to a game that took less than 10 hours to beat. I'm just obbsessed with guides. Unfortunately there is no guide out for Mario Golf, or if there is, Target doesn't have it.   Well, at 5 I went over to the church to practice with the worship leader. I might start co-leading worship for the rest of the summer. I can't wait to start, if I do that is. I also saw what GZ (Ground Zero, the name of our youth group) is going to look like for the school year. All I have to say to anyone reading this who goes to GZ is this: Ha Ha. It is going to be awesome and really different from what is normally there. I'm not allowed to say anything else though.   Well, I was there and about 10 or 15 minutes before prayer started my stomach started hurting a lot. Now whether it was because I was genuienly hungry or if I was just nervous about something, I'll never know. Then we had small groups and our group was outside. It was freezing cold! If I knew that we were going to be outside than I would have worn longer pants, and maybe shoes. As it was, I was in shorts, sandals and a very thin t-shirt.   Speaking of my t-shirt, I think four or five people read it, and it was amazing because I have almost had that t-shirt for a year and they were reading it like it was their first time. The shirt says "I still have a full deck, I just shuffle slower". Most people won't get it, they probably should wear it. One of my friends has a shirt that says "If I got smart with you, how would you know?". I really want that shirt. It is so hilarious. Again, if you don't get that shirt, you probably shouldn't get the shirt. I found a lot of geeky shirts, which is just the kind for me, seeing as how I'm a geek and proud of it. I want a shirt that says "Gamer." and that's all it says. It fits me completly, as you may have noticed by now. I have probably mentioned playing games in all of my posts and I will continue to. Well, this is all for now. I will be back later tonight to post todays thoughts. Good night everyone...er...good afternoon.

       Well, today was a weird day. Most people who know me know I can't begin to stay away from being on my computer. This is the first time today I turned on my computer. Yesterday I read a lot. This morning I finished that book and now I'm reading the next one. I am more than halfway through it and it needs to get better or I'm going to drop it like a hot coal on a summer day. It's not that the book is boring, it just hasn't interested me yet. If a book is not good within the first few chapters than what good is it to even have been written? Anyways, I'm extremly bored and I needed to write in my journal today. A few people have called this journal "interesting". Quite frankly I don't know what they are talking about. The last time I checked my life was pretty boring, but amusing to most. Well, that is your guys opinion. Enjoy reading my journal as much as you can. I already enjoy writing it, so now it's your turn. This will probably be one of the shortest journal entries on account of me doing next to nothing today. I did get McDonalds for lunch, but that is the only time I left my house. Have a great night everyone. Sorry if this entry wasn't that interesting.    *EDIT*  Tomorrow may or may not be a different day. I should be online more than I was today, but I'm not making any promises. My mom and I are finally putting my shelf up and we need to get some anchors (hard to explain). She and I are also going down to Funcoland in Dublin and I am probably going to buy either Mario Golf or a MegaMan game. I will try and turn my computer on when I wake up, but I might get distracted by something shiny.

       Well, today was full of a lot of nothing. Yea, your probably right (if you are a Homestar Runner fan, "Yea yoau pwobably wight"), that opener probably doesn't make to much sense. How can something be filled with nothing? Well, I can answer that question. First I have a question for anyone who is reading this. Have you noticed that I say well a lot? I started out my other journal entry like that. Well, you see, I have a problem with repeating phrases constantly. I tend to turn phrases that aren't usually cliches into just that. For the totally confused or vocabulary challenged a cliche is a phrase used to the point of it being overly familar. If you are still confused, look it up.  Well, (there it is again, it seems to want to sneak into all of my sentences, or at least my paragraph) like I said, I will explain how my day can be full of nothing (and a lot of it for that matter).  I think that that was the shortest paragraph I ever wrote. I woke up this morning at about 8:00 to my mom telling me that we need to get over to Las Positas College so I can enroll in my classes and so that she can get to work on time. Yea, I know, many of you did not know I was even taking any college courses. To tell you the truth, I did not know until very very recently. I am taking a musical theory class and if nobody believes me I have a Las Positas ID card to prove it. Anyways, I kind of mumbled incoherently and fell back asleep. Somewhere in between the time I fell back asleep again and woke up my mom told me that she did not have to go to work today. I personally don't remember it happening, but it did. So we leave the house at about a quarter until 9, we get there at about 9 and we go to the class that my mom says that I am supposed to register at. The person in there told us that we are in the wrong place and that we need to go somewhere else. We walked over there and stood in line for a little while. Now, I believe I told you this before, my life is pretty dull. If you want to skip the details be my guest, it probably won't be very much more interesting than this, but thats just what I think.   After I got done registering I had to take my school ID photo. Interestingly enough just before she was about to take the picture I was yawning and not even facing anywhere near the camera. Luckily the lady noticed and asked me if I was ready. After replying yes and letting my face turn back to it's normal color she took the picture. Now (I think this is becoming a catch phrase similar to "Well"), I am not a very photogenic person. If any of you ask to see my ID I will probably be a bit reluctant. I think that my smile looks really fake, which it was mind you. Although if you have ever seen a picture of my brother, Derek, you will see that my smile is absolutely ravishing in comparison.   We got done there and after taking a brief tour of where I am supposed to be, we headed in the general direction of home. Actually, we did not end up there. I needed to get a book at the library since my week is not going to be filled with a lot of action. We went over to Civic Center library (it is kind of in the center of Livermore for anyone who does not live in this state and happens to be reading this) and remember that it did not open until 10. It was about 15 til 10 so we went over to city hall (which is adjacent to the library) and decided to bug Derek's girlfriend, Amy. We got done there than walked back over to the library and went in. Needless to say, the book I needed was not there (actually, that was probably needful to say, but you would figure after all that trouble something ironic is bound to happen). Thankfully, the book was at Springtown library as most of you (and now all of you) know it is near my house. To make a long story short (and gramtically incorrect), we find book, we go home.  I got home, played a little golf (Mario Golf that is, pretty good game. On the Colin scale of 1-10 I would have to give it an overall 8). Then I sat in my bed and read for about three-four hours straight. Now, Colin has already read this book, but he is almost done with it (yea, I know, I reffered to myself in the third person, everyone refers to me like that, why can't Col...I mean I?).   That, my friends, was a whole lot of nothing. Have a great night everyone. Drive safely...er...if you are driving that is...and if you are, drive extra carefully...cause you probably should not be online whilst driving.    *EDIT*  As you may or may not have noticed, I kind of (Well, not kind of, more like did.) changed the page around a little to look more like my own. I am a fan of the black background, white text.

       Well, since I am kind of an odd person, don't expect to see normal things written here. I will write whatever is on my mind and whatever I feel like I need to let out. If you are expecting to see something that is interesting, you are expecting to much. My life is interesting, but probably not to many people. Maybe I should tell all of you a bit about me, that way you can possibly relate to me better or worse.   I am someone who trys to be dependable. I try to be loyal and I try to be a good friend. Now I am not one to judge if I am those things, you would have to ask my close friends and some of my family. Some of my hobbies include playing Classical piano, reading, playing video games and  trying  to have some kind of life.  I am a big computer nut and because of that I have been able to combine a few of my favorite things. If anybody cares to know, I do not like the Sound of Music, it just happened to work like that. I have a couple of websites that I plan on updating more often now that I have pretty much nothing to do. I will put both of the websites up at the end of this post. I also made a flash animation stick figure fight. It turned out pretty well and I got a lot of good feedback from it.   Well, I do not have much left to say. I will try and update this as often as I can. If you care to IM me please do I will leave a little bit of information at the bottom, but this will be the only post in which I do so.    urlLink Game Guides   urlLink Refined Reviews   E-Mail: sk8n4christ@hotmail.com AIM: nintendophreak20     *EDIT*  Well, I just saw Men In Black, the first one, for the first time ever. Yea, you guys may think I'm crazy. I fell asleep every other time I watched it. I only remember certain parts. I have seen the second one and everything. I don't know why everytime I tried watching it I fell asleep, but I didn't this time.   Mostly anyone who does not know me well and is reading this is probably wondering what I'm thinking. Well, maybe I'm mistaken, anybody who is reading this is probably wondering what I think of. I am actually very calm-minded. For the most part, I'm pretty sarcastic when I really want to be. I use sarcasim as a way to put things in perspective. People usually get upset at little things. I try not to, but I'm only human. I am pretty mild mannered about a lot of things. I will be as calm and rational as possible. Yesterday was a little different.  Last night I was feeling really sick. I do not know what was wrong with me. I had a terrible headache, a horrific stomache, I was sweating a lot, yet I was really cold. Now, I'm not one to usually get sick, and nothing was wrong with me emotionally or mentally (well mentally as far as I could tell). It did not stop for a long time afterwards. I went to bed at 12 this morning and didn't really go to sleep until sometime past 1. I haven't been feeling well this whole week.  Friday my next door neighbors left for Texas. They won't be back for quite a long time. I'm not even sure when they do come back. I thought, *Oh well, Dominique will still be here*. I don't have very many friends. Dominique and my neighbors are the people I spend most of my time with. Sine my neighbors are gone I figured that I would just get to spend more time with Dominique. She is leaving for a week long summer camp tomorrow. She gets back Friday and I won't have any sort of contact. When I found out I kind of lost a little bit of my mental stability. I have a whole week that I have nothing to do. Nobody to talk with, nobody to hang out with. Nobody to be myself with.  Dominique, I don't know if you are ever going to read this but I really miss you already. I hope you have a good time this week. Please don't change to much. I really like you and I hope that you feel the same way.  It's stupid that I even am like this. I left you for two weekends in a row and didn't go to youth one day, ending up missing three days I could have seen you. I'm really sorry and I know you are really sorry, but it's not your fault. Please don't feel bad, if it ends up ruining your week I am going to feel real guilty. I will miss you a lot.  Now that I have pretty much calmed down and let everything out, I better go in the bathroom and splash myself with cold water to hide the fact that I have been crying. This journal is seeming to serve the purpose I had for it. I am planning on using it to tell all of my friends how my life is going, but I am also using it for me to be able to unwind my day with and put everything down so it is not in my hands anymore. These will probably be short and long and everything in between depending on my mood. I don't know if there will be another entry today because I have pretty much drained enough.

       No "Site o' the day" today. I don't really feel like searching for one.   I am getting the sheet music for the song tomorrow (I don't remember if I mentioned this or not). I did not, not that I can remeber. The children's pastor at our church asked me to play piano for the christmas play they are doing. I would of had to refuse if it was actual christmas music. Luckily they are doing a parody of "Toy Story" (I thought I had told you guys, if I had then you are reading again; please tell me if I did). I get to learn how to play the "Youv'e got a friend in me" song. Yet with different words. It will be most awesome. I am pretty much done with this post. Nothing really new. Oh, I did get a new GBA game. I got "Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance". It is pretty interesting so far. But, it probably won't hold my attention. Well, talk to you all later. In the words of Patrick Starfish: "Liar liar, plants for hire".

       Well, I am pretty bored. I only got to talk to Dominique for like 5 seconds today. She called to say hi and bye and goodnight. She is so sweet! I don't really have much to say. The "Site o' the day" is spongebob. I don't know why, but I decided to put it up. I was bored and I couldn't really think of a site. I am sure it's a cool site, but I have never been there.

       Well, I was talking with my friend and I had a fun time purposefully mixing up my sports. *NOTE* the reason most of his "LOLs" and "LMAOs" are all in caps are because they make a noise when you are on Trillian. It sounds like someone laughing. *END NOTE*  [09:53:44] edicius2002: so, how bout them lakers?? [09:54:14] ME: i hear they will go to the superbowl this year ;) [09:54:18] ME: with all them homeruns they are scoring [09:54:21] edicius2002: lol [09:54:23] ME: its a wonder that that goalie is still alive [09:54:28] edicius2002: LOL [09:55:02] ME: i think that they will win the pennant [09:55:08] edicius2002: LOL [09:55:28] ME: their skillz can not be beaten by those raiders [09:55:38] ME: and i dont even know why they bother playing the giants [09:55:39] edicius2002: LMAO man [09:56:10] ME: the giants try shooting baskets [09:56:21] ME: but the lakers block and come back for the hat trick [09:56:31] edicius2002: LOL [09:56:45] ME: and wayne gretzky? PSHH [09:56:51] ME: no match for that kobe [09:56:52] edicius2002: lol man [09:57:11] ME: did you see when kobe did that kickflip over tony? [09:57:16] ME: i mean, it was all over espn [09:57:18] ME: and espn 2 [09:57:20] ME: and espn 3 [09:57:22] edicius2002: LOL [09:57:30] ME: i mean, he was like mario [09:57:32] ME: busting out with the jumps [09:58:23] ME: and then kobe did that triple lutz past deon sanders for the touchdown and they won the game at the end of the third period [09:58:41] edicius2002: LMAO  *LATER*  [10:12:53] ME: i was about to say...did you see when barry bonds caught the snitch with his teeth? [10:13:04] edicius2002: haha [10:13:32] ME: that put the lakers against the orioles 150-love [10:13:47] edicius2002: LOL  This actually does have some meaning to it. It pretty much shows that I have no regard for sports and I think there are so many of them that it's just stupid to try to follow any of them. The only one that would be worth following would be Quidditch. Well good night everybody. Don't never use a double negative in a sentence.

       Well, I don't have much time. I am at school right now and I am kind of upset at my U.S. History teacher. She told the class that if they worked hard enough that she would let them watch Maury at the end of the day. I am very offended by this show and I told her I wanted to leave the classroom for the time being. She let me and I am in the library typing this up. It really pisses me off that our class is so eager to watch Maury, a very crappy show. For those of you not familiar with the show, it is all about people's personal problems and how to deal with them. More likely then not they have to have a paternity (father) test to see who is the father of a child is. It pisses me off because they talk about it like it is no big deal that anybody cheats on them. They do these things all throughout the show. Let me tell you how the rest of my day is going. I assure you, it is much better.  TA: Well, I had to fix some computers. Lenny's english class came in to take a Star test. It was fun because he was reading most of the time. They came in once and we weren't ready for them. So they went back and read "The Crucible". Lenny said "Great, now I have to go back and read a book that I have read like 6 times already." I could only laugh.  Web-Page design: Well, I started working on the next project that is due on Friday. We have to make a "Sports" page. The only problem is: I don't play sports. She is letting me do SSBM instead. My partner was looking up pictures of the game playing and he found an interesting site. That is the "Site o' the day". Video Game museum. It has every game imaginable and some that aren't. They have a few screenshots from each one.   Lunch: As usual, we sat around and talked about video games. I am hopefully going over to Lenny's house and play Earth and Beyond. Supposedly it's a great game. If it is I will probably buy it and play with Lenny and Liam.  US History: As I mentioned before, she let them watch Maury. Actually, as we speak I am supposed to be in that class. I finished all the work before I left so she let me leave and come here. As I was leaving I prayed for that class. Everyone was excited because they got to watch Maury. Very stupid in my opinion.  Anyways, I think I should probably start heading out. Patty is picking me up from school (my neighbor). To answer a question people have asked forever. "Which came first the chicken or the egg?" God makes it pretty simple in Genesis. Read Genesis 1 and you will find the answer. Goodbye everyone, I will probably see many of you at Ground Zero tonight.

       Well, let's see. Over the past few days I have really had nothing amazing happen to me. Dominique is at work right now, so I am pretty bored because of that. Let me just recap my day today (it is a "B" day).  Before school: The other night, I had finished the fifth "Left Behind" book:  Apollyon . I thought it was pretty interesting, but I wanted to finish it fast because I could go into my english class having finished two books. It was pretty great. Over the past week, I have finished 5+ books. I read pretty fast, but I don't really notice it, usually. I went next door to see if they had the next book. Eureka! They did. The next book is called Assasins. It is pretty cool.  Math: Well, I did all the homework before he was done explaining it, as usual. *YAWN* boring, so I read for the remainder of the class, while occasionally making a few sarcastic comments on little snippets of conversation that I hear.   English: Sometimes I wish I took a foreign language, just so I could type this section in a different language. Anyways, I was bored in this class also. He assigned more reading. Since I have read the book completly, I needed not to read. I answered the questions and I didn't really talk the rest of the day.   Lunch: After dropping my things of in biology, I went over to our new spot. If anybody goes to Livermore High, this if for you. We used to sit back in front of the bathrooms right next to the practice football field, but now we moved! If you walk towards the 300 & 400 buildings and turn left (right away), you should be going down this section of sidewalk with an overhang just ahead. That is where we sit now. We have our own seats on the side, and our own backrests. It is pretty snazzy.  Free period: As I was making my twice-thrice weekly pilgramage to the shopping center that I meet Dominique at, I was anticipating what might happen on Thursday. I am so excited for it. It is the second meeting of the Christian Club (Ignited Youth) and I really want to go. I already like it, and I have only been once. I can't wait to see what God is going to do in my life, because I know he wants to do something. Anyways, I met Dominique and Samantha for lunch and they kept on flicking me and poking me and occasionaly elbowing me. I started to leave but Dominique guilted me into staying. To tell you the truth, there is no place I would rather be than with Dominique.   Biology: Grrr, sometimes this class makes me upset. I don't like having homework every night. One of my friends from Ignited Youth is in that class. She is pretty cool. We knew each other before Ignited Youth, but we didn't know each other was a Christian. That's not good, we should be telling the whole world, but instead we keep it to ourselves. Anyways, she and I talked during the lab, and she goes to Sunset. Now if any of my oldest readers remember, that is the church Dominique went with to the summer camp. That is really weird, because Abbey (the girl, I am not sure if that's how you spell her name) went also. She met Dominique there. Supposedly Dominique talked a lot about me, so Abbey knew who I was. She knew who I was, and my name, she just didn't connect the two. That is really strange. Anyways, apparently now she knows me more "personally" although I highly doubt she knows me as well as half my friends. Anyways, yea, that was pretty much the extent of the excitement in biology.  After class: Abbey and I left class together and started talking a bit. I kept on dropping my poster I have to do for biology. I got in my car and left for home without another thought. Then, I got home, and realized. I forgot my skateboard in biology. I am going to have to get it in the morning. Not really a big deal since I am going to go in through that way anyways. I will just nab it before I go in. Nobody should take it, and if it's not where I put it then I will ask the teacher if she saw it sprout legs and leave.  Well, that's it for now. Oh, the "Site o' the day" is a Piers Anthony fan site. He wrote the greatest series ever to grace the planet. The "Xanth" series. It is great. If you love reading, I highly recommend it. Especially if you find some of the things I say funny, he has the same sense of humor I have...or do I have the same sense of humor that he has, *PONDERS*. Anyways I just want to leave off with a good english essay writing tip: Don't never use a double negative in a sentence. TTFN.

Bye, I'll tell you about my Sunday later today, right now the teacher is probably going to get mad at me pretty soon.

       Well, I have not updated for quite a while. I wasn't really busy persay, I was just not really online, as many of you may have noticed. I will give you a basic recap of the past couple of days.  Wednesday: This was a "B" day, so I had 5, 6, 7 and 8 periods. This means a couple of things. One, I had math. Two, I had english. Three, I got to see Dominique. Four, I had biology. All of those were pretty much uneventful. Although I got to be with Dominique, which was easily the highlight of my day.  Thursday: Customarily "A" days follow "B" days meaning I had periods 1, 2, 3 and 4. TA, Web-Page design and US History. These are not my favorite classes, but the are better than like, math or biology. Also, the first meeting of the Christian Club. It was very cool. They talked about the plans they had for the year. I "met" a few new Christians. Actually, they were people I knew, but I didn't know that they were Christian. It was pretty amusing because they used to annoy me until I found out that they were annoying me in the name of the Lord. Also during the meeting I signed a paper for leadership. This was my big news about the procrastination and the like. I might start at least co-leading Christian Club. I also got my lunch buddies to come next Thursday. I will probably go to the spot just before lunch to remind them. Oh! That is going to be a "B" day! W00T, I can talk with Dominique about it later. That means I will have an extra meeting every Friday. I might get to start doing something with my faith! It makes me so excited! I despise, I loath  urlLink tables ! They are such a pain and the one I had to do wasn't much better. It was funny though, because I had finished coding it by hand before most people were done with the first couple of columns.   Friday: *YAWN*. Again, a "B" day. I got to see Dominique, and she asked me how Christian club went, even though I told her about it yesterday. Pretty funny stuff. She wrote me a note in code and I read it, and then later I went to visit her at work and she had written me a longer note. She is awesome! Anyways, we also had a sub in biology today. It was funny because he is a P.E. teacher. I didn't think they were qualified to sub for biology. Anyways, that was the extant of my school day. Later my parents had some friends over and I had to watch their son. It was so boring because all he liked doing was play video games and even though I really like video games, it really isn't my whole life. I fell asleep for like half an hour, quite humorous.   Today: I hurt myself on the trampoline, but it doesn't really hurt anymore. I was trying to do a backflip and shoot the basketball in the hoop right next to it at the same time. I got the ball in the hoop, but I landed on my eye. Trampoline burns already hurt enough, one under the eye doesn't help.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is regards e-greetings. A really good site with nice cards and a lot of options if you are a member (and it is free). Send me a card, I would love it.

       Well, I have been procrastinating this week, and it's time I stopped. For right now, I can only tell you that God has been working some big things in my life, and it's time for a change. The friends I normally hang out will hopefully understand. I have decided to do something with my faith. This is very exciting for me, but it may not be to other people, especially people who read this and do not go to Livermore High, which I think nobody goes to Livermore who reads this, with the exception of Kris and Sara, but I don't think they read this often. Tomorrow I hope to get my plan started, but I don't know how it is going to go. Anybody who can, please be praying for me. Pastor Mike said God would work through us this year, and so far, at least with me, he's right. I hope I can look to any of my readers for support.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is games.com. This is the place where I sometimes play pretty cool games. They have Scrabble, and that's a pretty cool game. I am going to go read for a little while now. I finished the second book and I am about a quarter of the way through the third book. Very good series, Left Behind is. I highly recommend it to everybody. It is purely speculation, so don't take it at face value. Remember: Nobody knows what is going to happen at the end times, and if anybody does, you might want to slap them a couple of times, or show them their wrong. *NOTE * I do not really think that you should slap them, I think it wouldn't do much help, just tell them that only the Antichrist would say something like that. That should stop them dead in their tracks.

       Well, I am kind of hot and a bit confused. The former is easy to explain: It's hot. The latter is not quite so simple. I think that the full idea of school has come crashing down on me. I am already getting tired of it, but I can endure it until this semester is over (I change classes around then). Well here is how my day went.  Quiz Time: We had a small quiz in math today. Quite simple, yet I still know I messed up. It was pretty funny, because I finished the homework for the day before he even handed out the test. I than read for the rest of the period. Quite an easy, yet relaxing, day.  Movie Theatre: Well, in english today we did absolutely nothing. It was ok I guess, but I would rather have felt that I accomplished something. We watched "10 Things I Hate About You" and Dominique got upset with me (more on that a little later). I only halfway paid attention since that was about how much I was interested. Only halfway today. I kept on reading the same book as in math.   Social Butterfly: Okay, that was more of one of those names that is really the opposite. You know, like calling a skinny person "fatty" or a tall person "shorty". I pretty much only talked with the regular group for the time. I kind of zoned out a few times. Liam said something about his theory of the end of the world. I pretty much turned it down with my theory of the return of Christ. He said it would take trillions of years for the earth to die. I said it would take only less than a thousand years, with the way we were going (*NOTE* This is only speculation on my part, I don't know when the return of Christ is, and quite frankly only one being in existence does: God). That is when I kind of zoned out. People kept talking, occasionally laughing, and I realized that if God came back now, I would be the only one gone in my group. That is, I hope I would be gone. If God raptures the church, I hope he takes me too. Anyways, that makes my mission even more worth doing. More on that when it actually happens.  Social Butterfly Part 2: This time I was a bit more social. I went to lunch with Dominique, as is now tradition on "B" days (again, 5, 6, 7 and 8th period for all you "Matadors").  I told Dominique what I did in english (Movie Theatre), and she got upset with me since I didn't pay attention. She said it was a good movie. It probably was, but learning about the Rapture was just a bit higher on my priority list. The only reason I got really into the Rapture was because of the books I am reading. I am in book two of the "Left Behind" series. Well, after we were done ordering at Subway (well, after she was done, I just took her drink; I don't like Subway), we went over to Carls Jr. and ate lunch with Grant and his dad. Then we left, and I left them at Granada.   Paying Much Attention?: In Biology I didn't really have to pay attention, she was repeating things I pretty much already knew. I think that I was pretty assured since I was able to finish all the homework without her explaining it. Anyways, yea.  Home Time: Sometimes I wish I lived closer to my school, or maybe even closer to Granada so I could go to Granada, or get home faster. I don't like my school or the positioning of my house (although it makes it convienent to go to CCC [my church]).  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is hotmail. That's where I got my email account. Very nice. I shall be talking with all of you on and off today. I plan on doing a bit of "light" reading. Remember, don't use me as a role model for your daily lives. Make your own path in the walk of life.

       I just woke up from a small nap. I am kind of tired so this post might not be too long.  Here are the  urlLink Unconscious Mutterings  for this week.

I really think I am going to go back to bed. The "Site o' the day" is "AJokeADay". It is pretty awesome, and it lets you get a joke a day (as the name may or may not imply) in your email. It's pretty awesome and they are never late. It does have a few adds in the email, but those are very easy to ignore. Have an awesome day everyone.

       Well, I haven't really put much today. I think it was because I was doing so much of nothing. I had to finish up an essay for school. It was that essay that took me an hour and a half to finish. I think that it turned out well. My mom read it and she didn't have any corrections, but of course, she hasn't read the book. The book is so boring, but it has to be read.  Today Dominique stopped by and gave us ice cream. It was so cute! She won't read this for a while, so I am allowed to say what I want. Me getting to see her was the best part. I also talked with her on the phone. She cheered me right up. It was so awesome, she is a really cool person.   One day, I was kind of bored, so I decided to go online and play a game at  urlLink pogo . I just sort of hit a random place to go in, and it just happened to dump me in a forties or older room. I was yelled at in that room. People told me that I shouldn't be in there, since I was way younger (I was like 13 or 14 at the time, no wait, it was before high school, 11 or 12). One person actually said, it's ok that you are in here. I don't discriminate against age. Than later she said, I am going to ignore that kid, he is such a brat. I found one other person really close to my age. I am never going to forget that day. It has always bugged me, just because I was younger and I happened to click on a button that puts you in a random room, people decide it's a reason to get on your case. If anybody has ever wondered why I hate age discrimination, there ya have it.  Anyways, I have to go now. *NEWS FLASH* Two guys who happen to run a small gift shop with all sorts of odds and ends tried to kill a cow earlier with two ceramic angels. It was the first ever alleged "Knick Knack Paddy Whack". G'night everyone.

       Well, I just finished the first book in the "Left Behind" series. I am talking to one of my friends and she says there are like nine books.   Which reminds me, that is the "Site o' the day". Actually, I don't know how good the site is, since I only visited it to get the link. I am sure it will have information on the book series, if you are interested. Well, right now there really isn't much more to say. I woke up and played some Nintendo briefly. Mostly because I was bored. Derek isn't awake yet, so I can't go on my computer and I'm stuck on my parents with a crappy keyboard. Actually, it used to be my keyboard, but when I got the wireless I put it in storage and their old keyboard was murdered. Anyways, I have a whole lot of nothing to accomplish until 3:00. Dominique gets off work then.

       Well, I am pretty excited, but I will tell you why later. The "Site o' the day" is Geocities. Now, this probably won't interest many, but if you have always wanted a website this is the best place I have seen. It helps you with HTML if you need it. It gives you 15 MB of free space. You can pay to get more, but I have a moderately large site and I have barely used up 2 MB. Anyways, that's all for the site.  First Period: TA; I had to fix other peoples computers some more. People were coming in and out for Star Testing. I really like this class because I really like helping people out.  Second Period: Web-Page Design; do you guys know what game is highly underrated? Ski-Free from the "Best of Entertainment" pack. I played that for about an hour and a half.  Lunch: Not very interesting. Lenny left to go buy soda, but he was gone for so long we figured that he was maimed, eaten or some other near-death, or death experience.  Third Period: Well, this was great. I go in, we do some work. Than do you know what the teacher does? She gives in to the other kids demands and lets them watch Maury on T.V. This is perfect for me. I tell the teacher that this stuff offends me and that I would like to go to the library for the remainder of the period. She has to let me go. So I did. I didn't really get anything accomplished, although that's not why I was supposed to go anyways.  Home: This is why I am excited. It's Friday! Actually, that is really a small portion of it. I want it to be Monday. I think God wants me to start a Christian club on the campus. For anybody who is from Livermore High and wants to start one with me, please contact me anyway you know how. Whether I have someone helping me or not, I am going to do it.  Piano lessons started today. I was incredibly rusty. Oh well, plenty of time to get back up to par. Well guys, I am eating popcorn and it is hard to eat and type at the same time. Talk to you all later.

       Well, I just got back from class, and it looks like I will be writing the next chapter tomorrow. I think I shall go to bed soon. I had to stay a little bit awake today because we had a pop-quiz. Luckily he did not count it against our grade, in fact, we did not even have to turn it in, or grade it. Than we did more things on notation and that stuff. I did all of it before he even had a chance to explain the first section. Than I went around and helped the people closest to me, since they were struggling. A few more people have finally asked me if I am even in college. So now there are like a total of 3 people in that class who know. I don't really care if people know, just in the past I have had some problems with age discrimination. It really gets on my nerves, but I don't generally talk about it. Maybe I will tell it later to fill in some black space. For right now I won't. I shall be talking to all of you later. Why do we have millions of laws to enforce the 10 commandments?  **EDIT** By the way, I typed this up pretty fast and I finally got to the point where I had no errors and did not have to go back on any of my typings. W00T!

       Well, I am feeling a little stressed, I have a lot of homework. I have a 3-5 page essay due in English on Monday. I have math and Biology homework, and I am sure I have other homework tonight in Music. I am just feeling a bit overloaded.   The "Site o' the day" today is Lissa Explains it all (for those of my generation: remember Clarissa Explains it all? Not the same thing). Lissa Explains is a website for HTML help. Not many people use HTML everyday like I do, but a few do. The owner of this site (presumably a girl, when you view the site) makes HTML easy. Very organized and the like.  Day 11 of the new school year:  Math: *YAWN* Boredom. I finished my English essay in this class, mostly all of it. Made up a few creative subjects, and just went to it. Normally, I like writing, but I wasn't very inspired in this subject. I guess it has to be inspiring for me to be more interested.   English: Well, it took us more than half an hour to get off the topic of September 11th. All the reasons it happened, all the reasons we even got into it and the like. A lot of people had said that we brought it on ourselves. The teacher actually said, to the class, that we had lost faith as a nation. We were cruel, heartless and hard to please as a generation. He said that one of the top reasons that we have so many gun related casualties is because we were a generation not brought up in church. That shocked a lot of people, because most of them do go to church, but not for the reasons they are supposed to. Most of them are forced to get up every Sunday morning, put on nice clothes, and act like a perfect little marionettes, doing everything their parents tell them to. I was not shocked. I think it is true. As a generation and a nation we have lost faith in God. This has inspired me to make more of an impact on my campus. Although throughout the whole thing I didn't say a word. I wanted to, but I didn't want to get in trouble for any religious ideas I might bring into the class. In hindsight though, I should have anyways. Than we read by ourselves in  Speak . Than he checked to make sure our rough drafts of our essays were done (I thought they were our final copies). Yea, that's about it.  Lunch: Food, not as exciting as English. Lenny did find his Visual Basic animation. It was pretty entertaining. But that's mostly because we are easily amused.  No class: This is my free period. I got my homework for the class I had next all done at this time. It was quite funny, since I was doing my homework in the classroom in front of the teacher, and she was helping me occasionally.  Biology: Made a few wise-cracks in it. Mostly read  Left Behind . Finished  all  my homework for that class, during the time she assigned and explained it. I love being able to do stuff on my own, generally without direction.  Home: Err, this isn't really a class, just what I call everything after school. I had to get an unexcused absence cleared up. I did, walking halfway across campus like four or five times. Very annoying. I got home, and I did my music homework, and here I am. I will add a chapter to TSG&E tonight, maybe, if I don't for sure tomorrow.   Have a great night everyone. Playboy Hugh Hefner ran off two monks trying to sell flowers on his property; which many people had been trying to shoo away for a while. When asked for a comment one of the monks said "Only Hugh can prevent florist friars."

       Well, I am testing something out, just to see how it goes. I found how to do the title feature, and as you may or may not (depending on what the difference is) have noticed that is what the title is this time. I may or may not keep this. If I do it might change how it looks, and it might feel inconsistent, but I will try not to change to much. I actually went through a short "custom phase" where I wanted to kind of customize my Blogger more. I figured it's great the way it is. I have always liked the black background with the white foreground (text). Anyways, this is only a test. Do not adjust your screen, we are not experiencing any difficulties.  **UPDATE** I have decided that I will use the title bar. The only difference is that it keeps the title in one spot, so I don't have to scroll up to refer to it. Also, tomorrow night, I have music class, since this class is boring I might write another chapter in  urlLink The staffs of Good & Evil  (my story; henceforth referred to as TSG&E).

       Well, supposedly (supposedley?) there are some new Blogger features. The main page says that there are a few new features. I guess there is some way to put a title on it, but they don't tell us how. That would be nice, since I am kind of using the "Feeling: ____" thing as my title for now. I also have a spell checker! An English nut's best friend. I think that I will use it and make myself look smarter. I can change the date and time so I can post this in the morning when before I even wake up. I can send posts while I am at school but have already written them out here. Yea, I am weird like that. Also apparently I can put them into draft form (although, there was already a way to do that, since all you had to do was not publish it; I guess this way you can post and publish without worrying).   Well, let's get down to brass tacks (oh, I din't bwing any, I dwove;  urlLink Homestar Runner ) I will give you play by play detail of my day.  TA: Boring, I had to help other people do a lot of work with computers.  Web-Page Design: Boring, now  I  had to do a lot of work with computers.  Lunch: Food=nourishment. More computers. Went into the computer lab to see if Lenny's disk had his Visual Basic animation on it.  US History: Literally, we did nothing. She said, free period. Supposedly, yesterday, I was unexcused from Math, but I was there, so I have to get that cleared.  Home: Better; I got a ride home from my dad (as opposed to skating home). Dominique called, said her mom cut their cable. Internet doesn't work, so she won't be online. Oh well, guess that means more phone time or maybe it's less...who knows? Also she has an orthodontist appointment tomorrow, the little booger. She doesn't have to go to school  and  we can't meet for lunch. I was looking so forward to it too!  Youth: I had to go early to set up and stuff. At twenty to 6 we still weren't sound checked. We need to get started earlier on the worship team. I sang and played at the same time. It's odd how I am the only one who ever does both on the worship team. We had a good message and the crowd breaker got screwed up. Oh well, it was funny just the same.  Now I am home, and I am bored. Very few people are online and most of them aren't talking. Well, my behind is sore, so I should probably get up. If anybody has a question about my day or a comment, please leave a comment. Please though, no rude comments. I accept both negative and positive comments but please, keep it civil. Who knows who could be reading this? Besides, I hate cussing!

       Well, the link of the day for today is Webshots. It's a really cool place toget desktops for your computer.   For some odd reason, I am sore. I don't know why though. Everytime I open my mouth (which for me is often) my jaw hurts. Also I have been working on a stupid computer all morning. It isn't working and I'm not helping. I don't understand what's wrong, and I really don't care anymore. It is just bugging the heck out of me.   I'm in web-page design now. I am really bored! We are going over how to publish your site on  urlLink Geocities . As most of you know, I already know how to do it, in fact I have done it several times. I wish this teacher would let me do something. W00T I am helping out now. I think I will be used a lot in this class. Well, people already have their hands up.

       Well, they really need to put that mood on Unkymoods. Floating is a valid mood. Today was a great day! Let me break it down. I'll name all the classes by an emotion, just because I can.  Late: I was late to my Geometry class because I was feeling a little bit sick in the morning. I felt a bit better a while later and went into class. The teacher didn't even notice. Well, he did notice, but all he did was curtly nod his head at me as I strolled in. Everyone turned their head when they saw me. I think it might have shocked a few because I had my skateboard with me. I will get to that later.  Bored: English. Reading. Slowly. I like the book we are reading, but we are going to slow for me. I like reading things fast and getting it over with. Obviously this teacher does not. I also have a five paragraph essay due by Thursday. As most of you know, I like writing, so it may be easier. Wow, I am turning into my teacher, reading this like he would. Scary.  Excited: It is lunch time. Time to leave campus. I stopped by Home (that's what Lenny and I call the spot we eat at) and told Liam where I would be. I than proceeded to leave the campus and skateboard in the general direction of Granada. Which brings me to my 7th period.   YAY!: Yes, this is my reaction. Dominique and I met for lunch. It was so great! I now know that I am going to like B-Days (the first time I put that down, was in Trillian. For you non-Trillian users, disregard this. For you Trillian users put in B-D [in all caps]. It confused me for a second. If you don't know what Trillian is, disregard that). Mostly because I will probably get to see Dominique, even if we get to see each other later that day. So now I am going to bring my skateboard to school everyday except on A-Day Fridays. Mondays and Wednesdays I have to skate home 'cause my mom has school. Oh well, it's a small price to pay. The alternative is waiting until sometime past three for her to pick me up, which I would rather not do. Next semester I will probably have to skate everyday because my classes will change. More on that next semester.  Hyper, a little: Dominique gave me her drink from Subway, so I got some Mountain Dew. That's good because I have Biology 8th period (the period directly after 7, for you Granada folks). My teacher is very late. Like 5 minutes after the bell rings. So I am sitting there waiting for her for 20 minutes, when I could have been in the class; in the nice warm class. Not to bad though. Could be worse, it could be pouring rain with no place to go.   Home again, home again, safe and sound. Came home, and my mom had biscuits made! W00T. I love biscuits!  The link of the day today is to another one of my websites. Actually, its to my alternate Blog. I am writing a short story in my spare time (which is harldy any). I like the subject matter, but you guys might now. Check it out if you are bored.   Well, I have some fat fish to deep fry. See ya!  **EDIT** Well, I feel stupid. You know how my header (my feeling and link) is bigger than the rest of my text. Well, sometimes I forget to end the tag to make it big. So I get this whole post that is all the same size text. It's easy for you guys to read, but it takes up a lot of space. Better now. If you ever see something like that, just wait a little while, I will come to fix it.  **EDIT** PART 2 Well, I decided to make the link of the day open in a new window. Anytime you click on one you will get a pop-up. That way you won't ever have to leave my site. YAY!

       Well, I was watching The Brendan Leonard show. I really like that show, I think it's pretty funny. They told us the truth about Canada. *Note: None of these are probably true*  Niagra Falls: Imagine you being a fish. You fell down the falls, and you can't get up. There isn't an elevator or an escalator. You are stuck down there. It's like college, except without the wetness, and the fish.  Canada's Maple Leaf Flag: When John Canada first discovered Canada he was trying to figure out the what should be on the flag. Once he got all the colors figured out, he couldn't decide what to put in the middle. Just than, a maple leaf fell down and landed in the middle. There you have it. So as John was tracing the leaf, an apple fell down. Now, if he had delayed a little longer, there would be an apple on the flag instead of a leaf.  The rotation of the Earth: In Canada there is a very tall windmill. That is how the Earth rotates and makes the night and day. If that wasn't rotating the Earth would just float around in space, without changing the day and night. It rotates the same way the Earth does.  The reason Canada is cold: Reffering to the windmill above: The citizens of Canada decided that they would take the coldness. They like hockey, and they don't mind the frigid cold. They say that since they already have to rotate the Earth, the might as well have it be cold at the same time.  Well, these are just some of the truths of Canada. I thought it was amusing and that you guys might want to read it. It's pretty much all paraphrased, so I may have left a few parts out. Thank you for your time. Your business at my Blog is much appreciated.

       Well, it's Dominique's and my anniversary today. I am feeling frustrated because I have no money and I want to go down to Loard's ice cream. Well, I can't so I am not going to. My stomach hurts because I really want to see her, but it's not going to happen. Well, let me wrap up my day in a few paragraphs.  TA: I had to help check computers in the library. It was pretty simple work, but very repetitive.   Web-Design: Well, as you know from the below posted, I had a project due today. It was so easy it took me less time sourcing it by hand than most of the people who used editors. So I got done early, than I played some Jezzball, got bored of that, made a new log-in name and started playing Chip's Challenge. I never found the point in that game. It's very interesting though. One of those new-fangled puzzle games.  Lunch: If I was graded in this subject, I would fail horribly.  US History: We did NOTHING! Seriously, she told us to finish up our timelines, and the rest of the day was free time. What the heck is up with that? I was so bored, I just read for the entire period, but really didn't read at the same time. One of those days.  After School: I had to skateboard home today, cause my mom had school until sometime past three. I was tired by the time I got home. I suppose I don't live to far if I skate home. It took me about 30 minutes to get home. It's just annoying; and tiring.   Let's see, what else can I rant and rave about? I am kind of bored so I might surf the net aimlessly. I fell asleep when I got home, but I was woken by two phone calls and a knock at the door. Grr, stupid after school responsibilties. I think having to do anything after school should be made illegal. Last Thursday night at school I got tired of listening to him talk, so I started writing a story. I will eventually start writing the story using Blogger. That would definitely take the bored out of boredom, and then it would only leave the "om". That's a difficult word to spell..."definitely". I had to look it up on  urlLink Dictionary.com  to get it right. My fingers automatically spell it defeinetly. Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely. Oh well, I will probably spell it wrong in the future, it's just one of those words. Like Geometry. Well, I would like to thank all 5 of my loyal readers for reading this. I hope that eventually it will become 6.

       Well, I am in web-page design now. After being in tech assistant for an hour and a half, I hate to admit it, but I'm getting tired of computers. As most of you people know, it takes a lot to get me bored of computers. I will probably add more to my post later.  The link of the day is my webpage actually. It's a project for web-page design. I got a grade for the page: 100%. Well, the bell just rang...sianara.

       Well, here are the  urlLink Unconcious Mutterings  for the week.    Bookends:: Harry Potter (those are the type of bookends I have)  Compliment:: Nice  Gutter:: ball  Obsession:: Magnificent  Heavy:: weight  Real:: time  Disposable:: Friend (it's from Speak; the girl wanted a disposable friend)   Breeze:: Wind  Work:: out  Sweetheart:: The Moon (see if you get it)   I lied, I am online right now. Dominique left at 8 and I just got home like 15 minutes ago. I had a great time with her today. She got me a new Piers Anthony book! Yay! It's called Swell Foop.  Anyways, the link of the day is ChristianAnswers.net. It is pretty cool. It has Christian reviews of video games, movies, CDs etc. They have great answers to any question you might have.  Well, that is it for today. May your dreams be filled with many Ninja Ferrets and green kumquats.

       Well, I just thought of a new feature. The link of the day. The link will be how I'm feeling, but it won't necessarily be linked to my feeling. This one happens to be a coincedence. I will link to a page that I find amusing, or boredom stopping or funny etc. I accidentaly found this site. I suppose I could add the links to the left side bar, but I'm not going to. I think that would make the bar to crowded eventually.  I am in search of some more journals to read. I think that I will make a search for them later.  Tomorrow Dominique is coming over after church, so I don't think I will be writing in the journal, or even being online, until after 7. Sorry, but tomorrow is to important to me to waste time on the computer. The only way I will be online is if she decides to turn on my computer. I don't know if she will or not though. If she's reading this now, she probably will.  Wow, I just realized I was ranting. Gotta stop that. Let's see, something interesting, something interesting...nope, I got nothing. I suppose I could tell you what happened yesterday during school.  Math: I decided to stop reffering to my math class as "Geometry". It takes too much effort for me to type "Geometry" correctly. My math teacher changed the positioning of the desks, so we got to chose new seats. Doesn't make much difference to me, I'm not sitting next to anybody (thankfully; during school, I am very socially inept; on purpose that is). I asked him if we could just sit anywhere. Mr. Lewin said: "Anywhere that looks good." I was just about to sit on the floor when he said to sit at a desk. Some teachers suck out all of the fun of being so literal.  Between math & english we had a rally. Rally's at my school are great. They aren't mandatory. I dropped my backpack off at my english class and my teacher tried to get me to go to the rally. Yea right, like I would go to the rally. He told me that his water-polo team was doing a strip-tease. All the more reason why I shouldn't go. Like I really want to waste a half-hour of my time watching a strip-tease. I'm sorry, I am not one of those perverted guys who actually wants to see that crap. I sat and talked with Liam, Lenny and Danny. Lenny actually admitted that he almost went to the rally. Only because there are soda machines near the big gym.  English: Well, all we did was read for like an hour and a half. I almost fell asleep. We are reading a book that is such a low reading level. It's a really easy read, and I estimate it would take me less than a day to finish it. I don't like the way my english teacher talks to us. He pretty much talks to us on what he thinks is "Our terms". Well, that is true for about 80 percent of the class, but the other 20 percent doesn't talk like that. Sara suggested that I asked one of the dumb preps around me. I agree.  Lunch: If it weren't for lunch, yesterday probably would have sucked. Actually, even with lunch, yesterday sucked. I don't enjoy B-Days (periods 5, 6, 7 and 8) only because I have math and biology the same day. Again, we pretty much talked about random things. Sometimes I wonder how many times you have to repeat somethings until you get it into their heads. Actually, that has no relevance to lunch, I just wonder.  Free Period (7): Well, since I have nothing to do, I decided to help my Biology teacher until 1:40 when class started. It actually worked, the time went by fast enough. When you have a free period, an hour and a half seems like a long time. Well, even when you don't it does, mostly because you are probably in class.   Biology: Last period of the day. We had to do a lab involving the temperature of water which fish were in, and how many times they had to breath if you altered the temperature. Our group had to fake it, since the stupid fish wouldn't sit still. I think we might have messed up, because one time I was counting with another person, and I got 100 times and he got 130 times. I think one of us can't count, and knowing my math abilities, it's probably me.  Well, that was a dreadful waste of 24 hours. I think I am going to go wander around. Oh yea, Dominique told me about this cool AIMbot called "smarterchild". Add "smarterchild" (without quotation marks) to your AIM buddy list and say hello. It's pretty awesome. He can tell you what time it is in other countries. Heh, that's what I thought was cool, there is plenty more than just that though. This is agent 11; signing off.

       Well, Carlos wanted me to update my Blog, so I am. Let's see, well, today in Tech Assistant (henceforth it shall now be called "TA")  I had a few things to do. I had to install a bunch of things on a computer in the office. Then I had to fix the Vice Principal's computer because she lost a function on it. That took up the whole class, just those two alone. I need to get a bit more efficent.  In web-page design the teacher told us to make a web-page using Visual Page (the cheating editor) and mostly everyone is done. I am almost done with it, but I am doing it all by hand. I also got to mess around with the digital camera. I decided to take a picture of the clock over the door. I used that for the background on my future goals page.  Lunch; I stayed a little while after web design to scan a picture. It didn't turn out very well. Than I showed just about everyone in the computer lab my stick figure animation (I think it is to the right, if you want to see it). I then went to my old english teacher to visit, and got recruited to help with her computer.  U.S. History=Nap time  Home; worked on my webpage again and here I am.  Well, that's all for now. Um...yea...er...yea, I'm done, just making sure.

       Well, I think Dominique has been working all day. I haven't gotten to talk to her at all. I am really bored right now. I don't think there is really much to say.   Well, I just got off the phone with Dominique. So that pretty much makes the above statement invalid. Dang, I am sure I did a lot today, I just don't really remember what. I think I will just stop...now.

My day is going alright so far. The best part was seventh period. I will probably not go any further than that. I shall talk to all of you later. Always remember to unplug the blow dryer before getting in the bath tub. This public service announcement brought to you by the letter "7" and the number "Q".

       Well, I am bored right now, so I might as well recap my day. I am adding the end thing in honor of my good friend Eh, Steve.  Math'd: He finally put the assignment up before the end of class so I finished it before he had even started talking about it. Actually, it was funny, I put down my pencil just as a random bell rang. It wasn't supposed to ring, but it did anyways.  English'd: Since the whole class finished "The Crucible" he let us watch a movie. Let us is the wrong word. Had us watch one. I didn't actually want to watch it. We watched Sleepy Hollow. I do not like that movie, to gory. I could be wrong, but I think it was rated "R". I tried to sleep, but I couldn't, so I finished writing the note to Dominique that I started in Math'd.  Lunch'd: I was so bored! My friends still talk about video games exclusively (meaning that's all they talk about). I am really tired of that. It is all they care about, and believe it or not, it's not all I care about. I am tired of hearing people so shocked because I don't base my whole life around video games like it may seem like I do.  Free Period'd: I went over to Granada but I left campus early so I was there like 10 minutes before their lunch started. I got homecoming pictures and I plan on scanning one tomorrow in web-page.  Biology'd: I was so tired that I fell asleep. The teacher was nice enough to wake me up discreetly, unlike what I have heard about at Granada. I had forewarned her that I was tired though.  Well, exciting day huh? I know, I need a better life, if you find one, please donate it to the "Get a Life for Colin" fund. Checks, Mastercard, Visa and American Express are accepted.

       Well, I haven't posted for a while. No particular reason I feel great, I just do. Let's see, my week has not been to eventful. Boring classes, as usual.   On Monday I had my "A" day classes. I don't rightly remember what I did in any of them. I think I did a quick image map in Web-page. It was almost a week ago, I don't remember that far back.  Tuesday I had "B" day classes. Interesting stuff. We read "The Crucible" on our own. I finished it because I was bored afterwards. Went to meet Dominique for lunch. I had a great time with her, as I always do.  Wednesday I had my "A" day classes, as the pattern implies. I think in web-page all I did was play Starcraft. It was already loaded to my computer, so I really didn't have to do anything.   Thursday; "B". In English we were finishing "The Crucible" on our own. Since I finished it already I was allowed to go to the library and get a book real quick. I got "On a Pale Horse" which I have already read. I started to read it, then stopped because I got bored. During lunch I spoke at Christian Club. It was fun, but I spoke for like 10 minutes. I wanted to speak for much longer. I visited Dominique and got to spend the lunch with her, just her and me.   Friday; if you don't know what kind of day it is by now, you need to go back to preschool and learn your patterns. In webpage all I did was help people out. I set up one of the computers. It didn't work so I didn't do anything for the rest of the period. Hopefully by Tuesday she will have had someone in there to get it to work. I don't really feel like doing it myself.  Saturday, I mean, today. I haven't really done much today. I talked with Dominique on the phone for a while. She is an awesome person, for those of you who don't know her. For those of you who do know her, you already know this.   Tomorrow is a youth run service at church. I am playing on the worship team and I am also playing for the offering song. It is going to be pretty cool.  Anyways, that's my week in two nutshells. I think I am going to go play some Tactics. I almost beat that game yesterday. I might try again today. I like it so much that I don't want to beat it yet.

       Well, here are the mutterings, just on time.    Country:: Yes  G:: H  Offer:: "I will make you an offer you can't refuse."   Connection:: Strong  Quest:: Stupid game! (if you really want to know, you can ask)  Lighthouse:: My mommy, she loves Lighthouses  Sycamore:: Groove (Again, you can ask if you really want to know)  Inhumane:: Inhumanities  Sneer:: *Sneers*, what a stupid one  Weapon:: BAD!    Anyways, my days are going ok. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to homecoming with Dominique. I had a really good time, for the most part. Today was good too. Dominique said the sweetest thing to me, but I am not going to say what it is. This one is between her and me. Thanks for reading and now back to your regularly scheduled program.  That's it guys. You can go now. Anytime. *Whistles then checks watch*. I am not going until you guys do. Okay, this is the part where you move your mouse up to the little "X" in the upper right hand corner (for you Steve, I am not sure which corner it is in, but it is definitely just a box). Okay on the count of three...One...Two...Thr.....

       Well, let me finish up my day for all of you.  Today: I had Math in the morning. I finished my homework before he finished going over the homework. It is quite annoying that I can do that before he even explains it.  There was a rally today, so we got out of Math five minutes early. My English teacher tried to get me to go again. I didn't, if I wanted to waste my time, I would just stand around and do nothing.   During English we watched a movie almost the whole time. Boring stuff. It was about the Salem Witch Trials, since we are reading  The Crucible . I was thinking about asking him if I could go to the bathroom and then going to see if the TAs needed any help. I didn't though. I sat there and "slept". Then at the end he kind of talked about it. I pretty much just zoned out.  During lunch I had a leadership meeting for Christian Club. We talked about who was speaking next week and for how long and what the subject was. Anyways, that was pretty much all we did, then we talked about nothing in particular for the remainder.  During my free period I helped out with the TA. She is pretty nice, and she likes GameBoy! Anyways, it was interesting, and I had fun messing around. She just played GameBoy the whole time.  During Biology I must not have been paying complete and utter attention. It went by to fast for that.  I had piano lessons after school, and those went okay. I have another song to play. I am singing a hymn or something. I am also playing "I can only imagine" 'cause I played it for her and she liked it so much.  Well, I will be going, talk to you all later. Remember to look both ways before you cross the street.

       Well, as the minutes tick past, I sit here and find some time to speak to you guys.  I hope everyone is doing well and having a great week. It's the start of another weekend. They seem to be coming fast.   Here is the recapitulation of my last few days.  Yesterday: It was an "A" day, so I had TA in the morning. It was pretty cool, they have this program called Network Assistant, and I was monitoring some of the people over in one of the keyboard labs. There is an option called "Control". It enables the user with Network Assistant to take over the computer. Well, I found someone who happened to be on AIM Express, which is not allowed on the campus, so my friend and I decided to mess with their heads. He typed in "Hello". It was pretty funny. The person who she (I'm only assuming it's a she; the name had the word "Angel" in it) was talking to said "Hi". Later, he asked why she said that. She said she didn't and that someone else did. Cameron (my friend) and I could not stop laughing. I thought it was pretty funny.  In Web-Page I walked in and forgot that I was wearing my TA badge. The teacher started to teach frames (which really sucks, if you know what frames are; if you do not go  urlLink here ). I finished it in like five minutes and she used mine as an example for the rest of the class. No big deal. So I went back to the computer lab and I put my badge away. That was pretty much the extant of that period.  It was Thursday yesterday, so I had Christian Club. I really like it, and it's a nice break from my usual friends. Not that my usual friends aren't cool, just none of them share the same faith as I. The speaker was a student. He spoke about prayer and he was good, for the first time doing it. Next week there is going to be another student speaker. If you really want to know who it is, come next Thursday to Christian Club at Livermore High. The club is in S-2. I happened to know who the speaker is and that they have a lot to say.   I am getting bored right now, so I think I shall finish this later. Tune in later for the continuing, not to mention exciting, drama of Colin's Life, as he reviews his Friday.

       Well, I have not posted for the past couple of days. Unfortunately for you who like to read this, I don't have much to say.   Yesterday: I messed around in first period. Finished a thirty minute quiz in five minutes and messed around in web-page. I ate lunch. Finished an assignment that was supposed to take the whole class in thirty minutes. Read for the remainder of the period. After school my mom took me over to the library so I could get the next book in the series ( The Remnant ; two more to go w00t!). Then we went to go get things for homecoming and only ended up ordering the corsage (or however you spell it, at this point, I don't care). Then we went over to the DMV and I took my permit test. I passed the written test, but I failed the eye-exam. Since I am blind in my left eye, I have to get a recommendation from my optometrist. It kind of sucks, but at least I won't have to take the test again.   Today: During first period I got all my homework done before he administered a quiz. I finished that, then I read for the remainder of the period. During English a book log was due. I had done it the night before so I was in the clear. He then asked everyone how far into the independent reading books we are. He pointed to me, I said "um" then he said, "Never-mind, you are like 5 books in", which was true. He gave us our vocabulary books and an assignment in them. I finished that, and read for the remainder of the period. Lunch rolled along and I ate with everyone. Then I started arguing with Abby about the present. Claiming that you cannot measure the present. Anyways, I won't get into that. Then I had my free period. I was reading, then a few computer techs came in, and I hung out with them for the rest of the period (in the computer lab). We messed around and I started talking to one of the girls about Golden Sun. She is cool, she plays video games. Then during Biology I finished the guided notes, which happened to pretty much be taken from the book. Afterwards I read for most of the rest of the period.   Boring days huh?   Tonight I have Ground Zero and won't be home for a bit. We are having practice after for the youth run service on the 26th. I might post something tomorrow, I might not. Who knows?

       Well, here is the new Unconscious Mutterings. No "Site o' the day".    Timeshare:: Sharing time  Accounts:: Multiple  Temptation:: Evil  Hack:: -ing  Shadow:: Puppets  Infection:: Disease  800:: + 800 - 800 * 800 / 800 = 800  Infidelity:: Not fidel  Springfield:: Illinois  Gardener:: Plants    I shall not be online as often. I unplugged my computer. I have my reasons. I am typing this from my parents computer and I will probably post something every other day, when I have web page and on Saturdays or Sundays, pending on my mood. I hope you enjoyed your little piece of Colin. I would love to wish you a great week. I will post again Tuesday, which just happens to be my permit test. (maybe tomorrow if I don't have anything to do).

       Well, I am getting slack on the "Site o' the day". I owe it to the fact that I can't find anything good anymore.   Today was an ordinary day. Did stuff, didn't do stuff. Worked, didn't work. The like. Not much more I can talk about. I've got church tomorrow, but I shall not stay for the whole day. Thank you for your time. Donations will always be humbly accepted. Make checks payable to: Colin Walker; Brilliant musician and video game extraordinare.

       Well, there is not going to be a "Site o' the day" today. I have a different treat for you. Please comment on this one. I would really appreciate it.   Inspiration takes many forms. Some may look to sports. Others may look to books. Still others may think of music.  My inspiration is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Nobody can take it away. It cannot become weaker, only stronger in time. It listens to my heart and watches over me. It delights in good and always triumphs over evil. It is patient, It is kind. It is always there. It is forgiving. One cannot see It. One cannot overcome It. One can only believe or not believe. It never fails. If you know what I speak of, you would know "It" is not an "It" at all. Rather a whom.  "A 'life' without God is hardly a 'life' at all."

       Well, today was a day as any other day was. Wow, that statement seemed to be a bit redundant. I don't really like redundancy, repeating things just isn't my forte. Redundancy sucks.  Anyways, now that I'm done with my irony for the day, I am really bored.  My dad doesn't get home until 7 or 8 tonight. Take that however you want, good or bad. It matters not to me.  I am going to homecoming next Saturday (18th). Girls confuse me sometimes. I won't get into the details.   Let's see, what else exciting happened, is happening, or will happen? You guys should know these things. Of course, if you did know, then you wouldn't need to come here, now would you?   8th grade. I was 13 years old. My brother was 17. Chris is handicapped. I don't know if I have told you guys about him or not. If I have, humor me. If I haven't, sit on the edge of your seats. Chris is a wonderful person. He is very social, but he doesn't talk. Very active, but he doesn't walk well. Older, but shorter. He is a contradiction of almost everything human-like. He is a gift from God. Chris has shown me to have love and compassion towards everyone, and I really try to do that. I try to be accepting of everyone, and only occasionally does someone rub me the wrong way.   In 8th grade, Christopher stopped eating. He used to be fed by an eye-dropper from my mom (not into the eye, mind you). One week, he just quit eating. I was very scared. Here, my older brother, my best friend, might die and we would never know the cause.   We took him to the emergency room, but they didn't know what was wrong. He doesn't talk much. The things he does say are very minimal and do not really convey his feelings. He can sign, but again, it's very minimal.  Our next door neighbor, Patty, is a trained special education teacher. She is another gift from God. One of the days that week, she came over to our house and asked my mom, "What if Chris just wants to feed himself?". That was the key. Christopher was tired of having my mom feeding him. So, the doctors suggested that we changed his diet from milk-based to juice-based.   The season in my life was the scariest one I have ever gone through. The mere thought of Christopher passing on honestly brings me to tears. I cried a few times last week because I was afraid of what would happen if I lost him.   My mom has always told me that God and Chris have a very special connection. God gave us, gave me, Chris on purpose. He knew what it would do to my character, and he wanted someone like me for the kingdom. God will always have me. Chris means a lot to me, and there are very few people who mean as much.   One of those people, will probably never read this. I will never forget her, no matter what happens. I don't  want  to forget her.   The "Site o' the day" is one I am sure Steve has seen. It is all about God and science. Showing evidence from science, that God exists. Not proof mine you, evidence. You can't entirely prove God exists, and you don't want to either. If you do, then it's going to feel like you have to worship him. God doesn't want that, and I don't want that for you guys.  Good night everyone. Take it easy.

       Well, I didn't have the greatest day, or weekend for that matter. I am happy none-the-less. I talked to my dad about going to homecoming next Saturday and he said it was fine. In fact, he said it was something I should be doing. Anyways, I got the next book in the "Left Behind" series (The Mark). Not that interesting so far, but that's how most books are. I finished the book before it, and that was supposed to be my book for the month. Anyways, I don't actually have to read for the rest of this month. Me being me though, I am going to read more. I actually have to finish the series and then read like a 1200 page book afterwards. Mr. Taber (teacher) wants me to compare the two series. Anyways, (heh, that word shows up every once and a while) I went to the library today and got the book. It took me like 5 minutes for a round trip total of 10 minutes.  Tomorrow is my make-up day. I have to make up all the work I missed last Friday, since this is the first day I have had the same classes as Friday. Luckily I have no seventh period, so I can get my work done then.  Retraction: I may have said some things in previous posts that were out of line. I was being a jerk and not very considerate of other's feelings. Please, you know who you are, forgive me. This person may never see it, but this is the right thing to do. I'm sorry.  1&#176: New teacher. The old teacher got bumped or something. I don't know. This is my TA class (Tech Assistant, as a reminder). She doesn't have a clue what to do. I played my GameBoy.  2&#176: Web-Page. The teacher was extremely disappointed with our  urlLink Sports Pages . Since we (we being my partner and me) did everything we were supposed to, we played a game of chess, then played some old arcade games. Much fun.  Lunch: The usual, talked about games; played my game; talked about more games; watched Lenny run after Chris (my partner in web-page; see page, then see "About Us"). The usual.  3&#176: Yawn. No really, I fell asleep while everyone was reading. Then I woke up, and the teacher had just asked a question. Everyone kept on yelling out random answers, I looked at a portion in my book, and got the answer right. Stupid classmates, don't really know anything. It's pretty sad when a half-awake gamer who doesn't do his best work when just woken got the answer while others were sitting there yelling "Stonewall Jackson" (the question was who came to watch the "First Battle of the Bulls"; the answer was the civilians, not Stonewall Jackson).   Hah, Steve is getting mad at me because I keep explaining my jokes.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is Gamestop. It's pretty cool if you're remotely interested in video games. You can find all the games you ever needed. By the way, there seems to be some confusion about the "Site o' the day". Click on how I am feeling (not the right mood, but the word after "Feeling:"). That will always hold the link. See you later. Here is the ending quote, which is now my favorite quote, ever. Religion is man's attempt to reach God; Christ is God's attempt to reach man.

       Well, Dominique and her family came over to clean my house, weirdos. They were doing it as an anniversary gift to my parents. I don't know what they were thinking, I don't really want to know either.  Yay! I got a "Site o' the day" for you guys. It's called Super Arcade. There are a lot of cool games there. Well, actually, for all I know more than half of them could be crappy. The ones I played were pretty cool. You can even play slime volleyball. Anyways, it's an overall good site.   In other news...well...there is no other news. Talk to you later.

       Well, I've got a real treat for all my loyal readers. I feel like writing a long blog. I am pretty bored right now, so I think I shall recap my weekend so far.  Friday: My parents left for Reno today. They are at their anniversary getaway. So they left Derek, Chris and I to fend for ourselves. Not that we would need to do any fending, maybe a little cooking, but we aren't a very hostile household. I stayed home from school because I was feeling sick, as you may know already.  I played a lot of Final Fantasy and read a little (wow, if this seems familiar to anyone, just skip on down a few sentences).  If you've decided to skip, then you must start reading here, I mean it. Yea, yea, I know, that was pretty mean. I shouldn't have got your guys' hopes up. You will not be allowed to skip a good chunk of this post. Okay, if you really want to you can. You can skip on down to the next day.  Today: Yea, I did it again. It is kind of fun. Fun like jumping into a pit of alligators. Yea, that could be fun, if you think about it over and over and over again until words lose all meaning. Today was a repeat of yesterday, except I didn't stay home from school. Well, I guess technically I did, but that's only if you want to be all technical. Considering I really was not obligated to go to school, I don't think it counts. I played some more Final Fantasy today. That game is addicting. If you are a gamer like I, you will want to keep advancing in this game. Well, supposedly I am not a gamer since I haven't played Ninja Gadien 1 or 2. Anyways, the Jennings (neighbors) came over for a while and played GBA and a lil' GCN. Good times, good times.  Tomorrow: Believe it or not, I actually have something planned. Don't worry, it wasn't on purpose. I have to watch Chris since we can't get a babysitter tomorrow. So I get to miss church. I don't really want to miss church, but it's not like I am going to be smote (heh, smote) if I don't go. Derek offered to watch Chris after church so I could go over to Jennings. It just depends on if Jordan is over. Wait! Danny just got his appendix removed, Jordan is not going to be there. I don't think I am going to be here tomorrow.   Anyways, fun weekend, can't you tell? The "Site o' the day" is Unkymoods! If you haven't already made the connection, if you click on that little yellow piece of paper with a face and a word (right now it would actually be four words, since the mood happens to be talky), you will get a link to it. Isn't technology great? Well, enjoy. Why do we need to clean behind our ears anyways? Does anybody look there?  Post Script (yes, that is what "P.S." stands for): I seem to be typing a lot better. I am not making many mistakes, and the ones I do are just because the dicitionary doesn't recognize those words.

       Well, now I really am sick. I went to school yesterday, and I went to school last night. At break I started feeling sicker, and I called my mom and she came and got me. I didn't go to school today. I pretty much read and played my Gameboy.  I was playing "Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance". It's pretty addicting, but eventually it gets boring. I played for about 3-4 hours straight. That tells you that the game takes a while to get boring. Generally my limit is like 1 hour by myself and maybe 2-3 with friends. So I guess it would be adequate to say that I was wrong, it will hold my attention.  In other news, the "Site o' the day" is back. Classical archives is a great place to get classical music. Even though you can only download 5 a day if you aren't a member, it is still very much worth it.  Well, I think I shall get going. My head is starting to hurt and it feels like I have acid reflux. Talk to you guys later. I shall keep you posted about my conditions.

       Well, again, no "Site o' the day". Same reason.   I wish I would get so sick. I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I feel sick already, but that is for reasons beyond (at least right now) my control. More on that later, maybe.  Youth was pretty dynamic tonight. A lot of crying for me.  Nothing new besides that. Talk to everyone later.

       Well, If you guys liked that last post, please comment. Eh, Steve has made a new forum!  urlLink Conglomerate Speech  is now open for business!  I post as "2corinthians418" please, join! We want as many members as possible. Tell 'em that I sent you.  Eh, Steve is being mean! He got a box of Skittles and he won't share! If you would like to see how big the box is take a look at my avatar (the little image underneath my screen name [2corinthians418]) at Conglomerate Speech.  That is all.  No really, 'tis all.   Okay okay!  You got me! There is more. I shall now recap my day as of now.  I woke up and got out of bed. I started playing a little Mario Kart (okay, like three hours worth) and I beat a few things. Then at about 10 in the AM I went next door and watched X-Men (the first one). I was planning on watching the second one, but by the time the first one was over it was way past 12 and I thought that I should probably call Dominique. So I did. She wasn't home. I accidentally (yes, accidentally) took a nap today. I was waiting for her to call back, and I was reading and I just fell asleep. Luckily she didn't call back, or in all likelihood I would not have woken up. I woke up and called her again and to my delight, she was there. Anyways, long story short, never lose your glasses, unless you can see without them.   That is your punishment for reading on. You get a weird ending. Maybe I will tell the rest tomorrow, although it is just as non-interesting. G'bye.

       Well, I am on my parents' computer today. It is a brand spanking new computer and it is pretty spiffy. The computer is quite fast and even though it has Windows XP (which I don't like) it's okay, temporarily. I wish I could be somewhere else right now, like over at Dominique's. I am so bored here. I'm sitting here, eating my peanut butter crackers and then my chips and I am doing absolutely nothing.   I got a new game a couple of days ago (I can't remember if I told you about it already). Mario Kart: Double Dash. It is awesome! I feel sorry for everybody else who doesn't have a Gamecube (more for the ignorant then the ones who can't afford it; at least the ones with no money wants one). Those who will never experience it, come over to my house, then you will want to get a Gamecube (I'm excluding you Steve, you're too far away).

       Well, it's Thanksgiving Day and I thought that I would give a little entry to you all.   No matter what the time, you should always give thanks to God. You should give thanks to him in good times, which is obviously easier then the bad times. You should give thanks that he is in control of all. It could be much worse. It is better to give up your life then to die apart from God.  This is all for today, I had a better Thanksgiving then most years. Dominique came with us to Merced at my Nana's and Papa's. We all had a good time. I shall talk to everyone later, I might not be on AIM but if I am, don't hesitate to say "Hi!"  To whom it may concern: I am sorry for any blow ups I have committed that may have affected your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it happens largely. I'm sorry.

       Well, here is a brief update about today, in general.   I had an okay day, but unfortunately I did not get to go meet Dominique for lunch, she had to stay home due to unforeseen circumstances. Also, the script I had promised previously is now working, I had an error in my syntax, I am all good now. I hope you guys like it, and I hope you will comment on anything you do or do not like and any suggestions for the site in general. 'Tis all for now.

       Well, I just added a new script courtesy of the Javascript Source. I am proud of it. I altered it a little bit, take a look, it's to the right.

       Well, I now have a new email address. I will not be posting it here, but if you want it email me (ha). No, you can just email me at my old address (I will probably not check that one as frequently though) and I will send it ASAP. You can also IM me: nintendophreak20. That will not change. Thank you for your time and devotion to the thoughts of Colin. Visa and Mastercard accepted.

       Well, I haven't blogged for a while, since Tuesday in fact. I don't know what has been up, but I am blogging now. Mostly because I have new mutterings. They are as follows.    Concert:: Blech  Sydney:: Australia  Shower:: Curtain  Patterns:: ABC ABC ABC ABC  Market:: Bazaar  Chair:: Sit  London:: France (I don't know, it was the first word.  Reception:: Table  Republican:: Democrat  Cough:: Hack   Let's see, I can't really remember much from Wednesday. At youth group we had a game night, and that would have been cool if it wasn't so loud. They had a mind game, and I was my team's representative. Whenever I answered I got it right, and I answered a majority of the questions before the person ended the question. It was pretty fun.   On Thursday I went to go meet Dominique and Sam for lunch. Those two are some pretty strange people. I believe I got hit with a straw wrapper two or three times. We always go to Taco Bell, even though I don't eat anything there. That night I had school and as usual, that was boring.  On Friday (A day) I pretty much had two free periods in a row. In TA we didn't do anything, as usual. In Web Page design I was excused from the assignment because it was a topic that I didn't want to discuss (internet censorship, and specifically adult entertainment sites). She let me go to the Mac Lab and help the teacher there out (my TA teacher). Interestingly enough, she didn't have anything for anybody to do, so I didn't do anything. I read and finished my book.  Friday night there was a dance. Sadie Hawkins dance in fact. I am sure most of you people know what the whole difference between Sadie's and some other dance is, but to take up space and your time, I will elaborate. At a normal dance,  usually  the guy asks the girl. For some odd reason, these kind of dances, the girls are supposed to ask the guys out. Whatever, doesn't really matter to me, Dominique and I both agreed to go since a few friends of ours were going. It was a fun dance, but we left kind of early and were freezing our butts off! In our district, once you leave a dance, you are not allowed to go back. Whatever.   Saturday. Ahh, Saturday was fun. I didn't even get out of my pajamas. I worked on a Biology project and then I played games all day. I wouldn't mind doing that every day. I talked with Dominique on the phone a lot too. My dad had left Friday for the Men's retreat at our church, so it was just my mom and me for the most part. Chris was there, but he was just being his, now normal, wacky self.  Today has been going fairly well. I woke up about a hundred times last night, for lots of reasons. I slept in the living room, just because I could. I fell asleep reading, and that was okay with me. I woke up and played a little  urlLink Mario & Luigi . Then I got ready for church and walked over there. Dominique passed me up while I was walking, they didn't even bother to stop (of course, I am just kidding, I was like less than a minute away). Our youth pastor, Pastor Mike, announced the missions trip our group is taking this year. We are flying to Belize, a country in Central America, down by the Bahamas. I found it funny that he had something prepared but we got him on the subject of the trip. We just had a time of fellowship and asked him questions about it. It's funny how we sometimes forget that even if we have something planned, God doesn't always think it is necessary. Anyways, after Sunday school I needed to set up the special needs class for my brother. We did that and went inside to the normal service. It was pretty cool, the sermon was about giving thanks continuously, instead of just at Thanksgiving. Then afterwards they had a little basket giveaway. There were like 10 baskets set up with different sorts of prizes. Dominique entered my name into one of them, and since she did that, I entered her name into one she really wanted. Neither of us won, but that's okay. The money went to the Women's Ministry. Then Rachel (Dominique's mom) took me home. We talked for a little while and then I went inside.  Sorry, I was rambling. I guess I don't notice it with myself or anybody. I figured it doesn't matter if I do here, I am not making you guys read this. Well, I have some twinkies to deep fry, you may go..........now!

       Well, I am all better, so I will be going to school tomorrow. It is so cold right now! I wish I could go outside and run around and do stuff, but my mom would really frown upon that. Let's see...I didn't really do much today. I talked with Dominique online and she and a friend were purposefully trying to confuse me. It worked, but it wasn't funny! Anyways, there is nothing else to say. Tomorrow is an A day so it is going to be weird going to my A day classes two days in a row. I should have been sick yesterday, that would have been much better for me. I would have much less homework to make up. I think I shall be going now. Talk to everyone later. Oh, everyone go to  urlLink http://www.google.com  type in "Google" and then hit the "I'm feeling lucky" button.

       Well, now I am not going to school for sure. I am really sick and I hope that you guys all will be praying for me. I will be online for maybe like an hour today. 1:30-2:30 (4:30-5:30 EST). I will talk to you all later.

       Well, this is just great, I am sick. My throat is killing me and I don't think I am going to school tomorrow. I really want to go to school tomorrow, since it is a B day. I always meet Dominique for lunch on B days. Grr!

       Well, my throat has been hurting all day and it is really bugging me.   Grr, just before class my skateboard broke, but more on that later.  Today in Tech Assistant, as you may have already noticed, I had nothing to do. For the first half hour of the class (a third of it) the teacher (or supervisor, whatever) was not even there. I went in and it says she was in room 305, so I hauled my butt over there. She gave me the keys and told me I didn't have to do anything. So that's just what I did: nothing. I wrote some stuff on the board for whoever wanted it could read. I added the post just below this one also. I had a longer one, but I accidentally erased it, oh well.   Web page design: Nothing fun. We read an article about  urlLink software piracy , which was pretty funny. Then we had to make a survey and write our opinions on the matter. It was pretty boring and tedious. We spent the first hour trying to get the logo to match the rest of the background. Stupid CSS.   Lunch, I ate food, I was bored so I went into the PC lab and posted at Four Cool Guys. If you want the new URL to it IM me at nintendophreak20.  US History. Wonderful class. She put the work for the day on the board! Yes! I did it all within the first 10 minutes of class, then I took a remake quiz that I really didn't need to take, but I was bored and then we did a worksheet. I was done with 30 minutes left of class, and she let me go. There wasn't anything else to do.   Now I am home and I am kind of tired. I broke my skateboard by just standing on it. It really sort of pissed me off. That was before school. I had to walk home because of it. It wasn't to bad, it could of been worse, it could have been raining. I got a new GCN game (Tony Hawk's Underground) and I can't play it until Friday. Oh well, the wait will be worth it. When my mom got home I went over to my neighbors and had my friend help me with fixing my skateboard. It really feels weird because now it rides like it is supposed to.  I am about to go eat dinner, so I will talk with you all later. Did you konw taht it dnseo't mettar waht oedrr lrettes are in? As lnog as the fsrit and lsat lteter is in the rhgit pclae.

       Well, blogroll is down. Please, if you go to the site listed, don't say anything to them about them messing it up. She and her husband have both said they don't know what happened to it.   Our "friend" is back. Luckily he still hasn't gotten to this site. He will be blocked immediately when he comes here. I am tired of his anti-everything. I am done arguing with him.  Please come again.

       Well, I am tired of our "friend" posting here. I have decided to call a meeting of all FCG bloggers sometime tomorrow. I will get together with Steve to figure out a good time. We can not just take this sitting down. We must take some action. I will be waiting online for most of the day tomorrow. Hopefully we can get all four of us on at once.   Romans 8:35  "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship r persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?"  Who will separate us? Will it be him? I know he can't separate me from the love of Christ.  Philippians 4:6 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."  Pray for this guy guys. He cannot do anything to us but we can do a lot to him. We have the chance to change this guy from a Saul to a Paul. Just pray.  Philippians 4:13 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."  This is living proof that we can do anything. God has enabled us, he has given us authority over hell and hell's demons. We can do this.  Contact me (whether through email:  urlLink sk8n4christ@hotmail.com  or AIM; which you guys have) and tell me the best time for you to meet with everyone else. If you can, try to remember to tell me if you mean EST or PST. Thank you for reading this all guys.

       Well, I ate lunch and a bowl of chips and some crackers. I am full.  Now let's get to business. The mutterings are as follows.     Plan B:: Plan A didn't work.

I am almost done with this post. Just one more thing I need to do: ERGLESNEED! You know what I find fascinating? Blogger's spell checker does not recognize "blogger" as a word.

       Well, I downloaded a  urlLink Bible . It is pretty spiffy. It has the Hebrew (and I assume Greek in the New Testament) words and meanings for everything. I like it a lot.   Yum, I am drinking some strawberry milk. Strawberry milk is yummy. I am so bored right now, nobody is online, and if they are online they are away.   We were having some problems with some guy who decided to take a whack at the Christian faith. Luckily he never hit here. He would have been out of this place when he started posting as "~Jesus Christ~". We tried to be nice to him. We tried giving him a chance, but he did not want to submit. He visited our site, we never came to his. He cannot come back to four of our five sites (this is the only one he can come to). If you want to look at the things he has said visit  urlLink The Brit Pit ,  urlLink Mike Speaks  or  urlLink Four Cool Guys .  One could search, but never find someone as awesome as her. Well that's all for now. I shall be going.

       Okay, enough of the fa&#231;ade. I have had a horrible day. I feel like I am constantly walked on by my friends, most of them. I feel that if I don't perform at the expected level everyone is disappointed. I feel like nobody, except Dominique, really cares about my wants or needs. I feel horrible. Nobody can really do anything to help me.   Mark 10:45 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for the many."  I have tried my hardest to serve, but it seems like nobody cares what I do. The new blog that I started blogging in makes me feel like such an outsider. I will still continue to blog there, but it is hard when all of them have made such tight-knit friendships and the only thing keeping me there is Steve. It might end up being me leaving and only blogging here, like it was before. I wish Dominique lived closer, she makes me feel so much better.

       Well, bear with us while Steve and I are remodeling. It will look more spiffy when we are done. I got the comments back up, so that is a definite step forward. Well, I am back at my old computer. I realize how many unwanted pop-ups I really get. I like my parents computer better for that reason only. They get no pop-ups. I get pop-ups when my browser isn't even up. Well, I don't think I have much planned today. In fact, I know I don't have anything else planned today. I am so bored! Well now I am going. I pity all of you people who have trouble falling asleep. I can fall asleep anywh...................

       Well, I said that I would give the definition of the word f&#252;mp at  urlLink Eh, Steve's  blog.    F&#252;mp N. V. Adj. Fo-omp 1. A word meaning just about anything. Usually used in an onomatopoeia-like sense(onomatopoeia means a word that is described as something that really isn't a word. Such as the crinkle of the leaf or the woosh of the wind).   The story behind f&#252;mp is this:  Pastor Mike, our church's youth pastor, used to know this one guy that worked on the youth staff. This guy was a big guy, 6' 3" and over 300 lbs. He was a really good storyteller. One day, as the man tells the story, he and his buddies were messing around with a hamster. They had this vacuum cleaner and they were going to try and get him to get sucked up the vacuum cleaner. They were getting dangerously close, than all of a sudden f&#252;mp, he got sucked up. We spent the rest of the night (this was Sunday night at the youth trip) thinking of things that go f&#252;mp and asking Pastor Mike what goes f&#252;mp.

       Well, I don't feel real well right now. I am not so sure why. I will be gone this weekend. I am going on a trip with the youth. Which reminds me, I have to pack for that. I will do it before I go to bed. I am thinking about plugging my computer back in tonight, just before I go to bed, and then not using it tomorrow (since I will be gone anyways) and then see if I even remember it on Tuesday. Eh, by writing it down here, I probably will remember it. Oh well.   Today I pretty much did a lot of nothing. I went over to my neighbors. They just got Finding Nemo, so I was watching that (yea, I had seen it before with Dominique, but it's still good). I don't feel like having a "Topic o' the day" today. The first one didn't work out, and as far as I know nobody has still commented on the second one. I don't really see the point. Come to the new group blog  urlLink Four cool guys . Lookin' at a thing in a bag.

       Well, I have a few friends who are going through some rough times. I am unsure what to do, I just hope that God can direct me. Let me see. I am trying to think of a topic of the day without sparking to much wildfire. The "Topic o' the day" is stress. How do you guys deal with it when you have it? How do you help others deal with it? What causes stress in your guys lives? This is something that I am sure can not be changed into a debate. If it can and it is a civil debate then it is fine.   My day went by pretty fast, although at first it was slow. During TA I had to go change some IP Addresses for the school. It was so annoying. This is not that hard of a job but my predecessors could not get the hang of this. One of the numbers was off by one, which is enough to make the internet not work.   Web page design was even worse. We had no internet until like halfway through the period. The district had changed the web blocker programs to block just about every site imaginable. The only site I could get on was Google. They even blocked Yahoo. Stupid district people.   Lunch was lunch. My friend had crutches and Lenny took them and was messing around. Then I took them from Lenny and was riding my skateboard with them. It was quite enjoyable actually.   In U.S. History I was barely paying attention. I was writing a note and the teacher came by and asked me if I was doing my work. I said "No" and continued what I was doing. She doesn't actually mind. I am getting an "A+" in that class, she can't complain.   I went home, got Chris from Patty's and left for youth group at about 4:20. I talked with Dominique (the most awesome person alive) and set up for worship and stuff. End of the night rolls along, and here I am, sitting at the computer, typing things up.  That is all.

       Well, I just got off the phone with Dominique. We were talking about abortion and what our views our. This is the "Topic o' the day" (original title, eh? Can you guess where I got it from?). I decided that a "Topic o' the day" is much better than a "Site o' the day". Much more interaction. If you want to speak out on the topic, you may post a comment at this post, and this post  only . It will be much easier to keep track of. You can always remain anonymous and need not answer anybodies questions. These are your thoughts and believes. I will not let them be violated here. I will not start with the topic and let someone else who wants to. I think it will be much easier this way. Remember, the topic is abortion. Guys, please, speak out. I know a lot of guys don't have opinions but I want to hear them.  My day has been going great. Although this computer I use occasionally freezes whenever I am typing and someone is IMing me. I think I am almost ready to go back to my old one. I hope everyone is having a great day today. That is all for today. Um...Goodbye. Err...Erm...Adios.

       Well, I have finished my web-page work. I am so bored now that I think I am going to change the style of this site a little bit. I am going to change the title style (so it will look different as of this post) and I am going to use my new found knowledge (shut up Eh, Steve, I know you know more) of CSS. I am so bored right now. I also need someone's help, most likely Eh, Steve's to change the format around. The format looks okay when viewed from a PC but it is not Mac compliant yet and I am surprised he puts up with it.   I have a "Site o' the day"! It is actually the project I just finished for this class. Read it, it is pretty funny. All I did was change the font and the colors a little.   Now I am done and I am going to go mess with the CSS on this page.

       Well, I just woke up 15 minutes ago. It is very cold this morning. The weather sort of changed pretty fast over the weekend. Thursday it was burning hot, and Friday it rained. It rained last night (I could hear it before I fell asleep). I am actually not in my blue or grey sweatshirt (for those of you who never see me, I am always in one of those). I am in a red sweatshirt that most of you guys have never seen.   I started playing two games this weekend. I am getting fed up (not to the point where I would get rid of)  FFTA (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; I beat it a few weeks ago). I started playing this Mario RPG game for the Super Nintendo. I have already beaten it once, but it is nice to return to old classics. I also started playing Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64. Again, I have beaten that, but it's an awesome game. Both of those are RPGs and Paper Mario copies off the first Mario RPG. I played both of those for like 3 hours last night. I plan on playing them when I get home today, hopefully, if I have no homework, and I am not over at the Jennings, or talking on the phone, or talking on the phone while doing my homework over at the Jennings. Anyways, I am extremely bored this NoRemember morning (read Piers Anthony's visual guide to Xanth. He decides to mess with the months).   *YAWN* I think I will be done for a little while, unless my dad is still out in the living room reading the paper. I like being in there alone so I can play my GameBoy in peace. Yet, he is still there. Now he is talking with my brother, or I think it's my brother. They both have real loud voices, so they always wake me up in the mornings. I am really unlike anyone else in my family. Derek is like my dad. Chris is like Chris. I am pretty close to my mom in our actions and reactions, but I still think I am different. I think my dad should take a shower pretty soon. It is 7:15 in the Ante Meridian (AM). I need to get off now, Derek wants to check his email. I will try to get done in web-page fast so I can add more. Maybe I will just write some more in Tech Assistant. Remember, the sky is the limit, unless you are in a spaceship.

       Well, I am feeling so good! I just got back from the movies with Dominique. I won't post this officially until I get the Mutterings for the week. I don't want to forget to do it. I think I shall just ramble on until it comes. Well, nothing really to ramble on. By the way, in case you were wondering, my mood hasn't changed on purpose. I am still floating. Maybe I will just make up my own for someone else to copy, then I will put my own there.     Hebrew ::  Llama ::   Achoo ::   Calvin ::  Piano ::  One time use ::  Route ::  CD ::  Boredom ::  Teenage ::    Alright, I am not getting the E-Mail so I will post the actual Mutterings tomorrow. These were not the Mutterings for this week, I repeat these were not the Mutterings for this week. This is only a test, please do not adjust your monitor for any reason.

       Well, I am feeling pretty good. I don't know if I am feeling elvish, I was just feeling random today.  I went over to Dominique's house so we could exchange gifts. I got her a diamond ring and a picture I took. She got me  "The Truman Show"  on DVD (Jim Carrey is my favorite actor) and a little Mario doll (yes, like the one Sam got me, except not Donkey Kong). I have had a pretty good overall day. I played a little SSX 3 in the morning and I watched The Family Guy when I got home. I have a birthday party to go to (my best friend Grant is turning 17) tomorrow and I will probably not be online much, like I was today. I feel weird typing in a journal that I haven't used forever. Maybe people will start flocking back here when they see that I am getting active again.  I have a lot of nothing planned for this week. Sometime on Wednesday (Christmas Eve) we are going up (down; whatever direction it's in) to my Nana's house in Merced. Christmas day my grandmother, grandfather and maybe his wive (my blood grandmother and grandfather are divorced and he is remarried) are coming down. One "big" "happy" family. On New Year's Eve Dominique is coming over for who knows how long.   Anyways, that's all for now. If the number 2 pencil is the most popular pencil in the world, why is it still number 2?

       Well, sorry guys, I haven't posted in like over a week. I think this will be a longer post than normal (seeing how the normal is now nothing, it already is longer). First off, let's see the new mutterings this week.    Exchange:: Gifts  Parental Advisory:: Suggested  Blowout:: Ghost Busters ( * )   Spider:: Arachnid  Happy:: Sad  Intense:: esnetnI  Corrupt:: Not Corrupt  Got:: Not  Crude:: Bad  Three:: Wise Men (Yea, Christmas spirited, I know)     * We have a Haloween alternative called the  Ghost Busting Blowout ; that's the only reason I thought of that.  Anyways, today was cool. Our little group of friends exchanged gifts, and to my surprise I got stuff. I kind of feel bad for not getting anybody anything, I just usually don't get anything and don't expect anything in return. Anyways, I got a little Mario 1-UP bracelet from Nick. Sasha gave me a Star Wars Lego set with Jaba's palace. Samantha got me a two liter bottle of Mountain Dew (YESH!) and a Donkey Kong stuffed animal. Dominique and I are exchanging gifts tomorrow. I will tell you what I get tomorrow (as well as what I got her *laughs*). Anyways, thanks to the person who read all of this. For that I will reward you handsomely. You can be the first to comment on this post. Talk to you all later.   You are the weakest link, goodbye.

       Well, I might be copying Steve's post, but I am extremley bored. Today's post is going to be completly in binary code. I was really bored and I am kind of tired. I have been working on my forum for about a week now. We have a lot of members and we are starting to get a bit active. Hopefully more people will join and see it and stuff. There is a link on the side, I hope to see you guys there. I have now watched Bruce Almighty a total of four times. I love that movie. Anyways, that is all for now. I will talk to all of you guys later. Hope you are having fun decoding this. Bye.  Okay, well it didn't really work out. I didn't want to have to put spaces every couple of sentences. So just how I am feeling is in binary code. Maybe I will put it in hexidecimal later.

       Well, this is just a poll post. I have a question for you guys.  If I were to create a forum (such as Steve's  urlLink Conglomerate Speech ) would you guys join? A simple yes or no would do. If you want to you can always produce a longer answer, just make sure it is clear what you intend. It will  not  influence my decision in anyway, I am just curious as to who would and who wouldn't. Just leave a comment.  Thank you,  Colin Walker  -The Management-   urlLink Twice Double !

       Well, I have no idea what happened to the keyboard. I am pretty mad at it now. It works fine now, but I had to restart the computer. My caps lock was switched so that when it said it was on, it wasn't and vice versa. It wouldn't let me put numbers in (so no, I was not cussing, I was trying to put numbers in) regardless if it was on or not.

       Well, my throat has hurt since Saturday afternoon. Nothing seems to help it, but yesterday was the worst I felt. It wasn't even that bad, I just needed a nap. I don't know what is going on, but I would like to. A whole morning I feel sick, then in an hour of sleep, I feel fine. My throat hurts, I am coughing a lot and I almost lost my voice, but that is the extant. Right now my throat just feels a little hoarse. I wish something would happen to stop this.  Anyways, my day at school was pretty cool. It was nothing special, just nothing horrible. @)!($&*!@ what the heck? my shift key doesnT WORK

        urlLink     One night I dreamed I was walking  Along the beach with the Lord.   Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.  In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.  Sometimes there were two sets of footprints.  Other times there were one set of footprints.   This bothered me because I noticed that  During the low periods of my life when I was   Suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat,  I could see only one set of footprints,  So I said to the Lord, "You promised me,  Lord, that if I followed You, You would walk with me always.   But I noticed that during the most trying periods  Of my life there have only been  One set of prints in the sand.   Why, When I have needed You most, You have not been there for me?"  The Lord replied,  "The times when you have seen only one set of footprints Is when I carried you."  --Not me, unfortunately. It's a good poem. &nbsp; urlLink

It was nearly two hours long. After the movie we went to Starbucks and then to Nations. Silly girl, she kept on throwing fries at me.  We went bowling afterwards and I think she spent more then $40 on games. We played a couple of racing games and we played this one weird prize winning game that I got addicted to a 'lil bit. Probably spent more then $5 on that one alone. Then her mom picked us up and we went to Safeway to get gas and food for them.   Now I am home, with nothing to do. Waiting to talk to people's.   She probably gets to go to Merced with us this weekend. It's my Nana and Papa's 50th wedding anniversary and we are having a big party, and Dominique was invited. Isn't that neat-o?

       Well, I reviewed a few of my posts, and I wanted to give you guys a comparison. I would ask that anybody who is reading this post, please make sure that they have read  urlLink this post  first.  I wanted to compare to you guys my life at the beginning of Junior year and at the end of Junior year.  Beginning: I was very unsure about myself. My best friend had just moved to Oregon and I was feeling horrible about it. I had protected her last year and she really had depended on me for guidance, and now all I could do was let her go with the knowledge that God went with her. Dominique and I were still together and were just about to celebrate our one year anniversary. I was supposed to have my license soon and therefore, the ability to drive to Dominique's house. Little did I know how different it was going to be.  Now: I still miss Jessica all the time. She was a fantastic person and a great friend. Dominique and I are still going out after some hard times and while it seems we might be going to those again, I still like her so much and hope that this is who God has for me. I am not unsure about myself anymore. God is with me, I know it. I was struggling with my sins at the beginning and I am now on the road to victory.   I see how much I have grown after reading all of those, not only in my spirtiual walk, but in my mental abilities. My writing has improved greatly, and my sentences don't look so choppy. I hope to keep thie blog for many more years and I have decided that eventually I am going to upgade this to blogger pro. I love writing and this is one way I can really write what I feel. I hope that all of my readers stay with me as I move around and that I can stay with all my readers as they move around. I want all of them to know that I love them all and that anybody who reads these posts know more about me then my parents do.   Sometimes I wish I could be out of here and sometimes I dread that time. Anyways, post a comment.  "Dark Helmet: Before you die there is something you should know about us, Lone Star.  Lone Starr: What?  Dark Helmet: I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.  Lone Starr: What's that make us?  Dark Helmet: Absolutely nothing!

       My brother Chris is the most amazing person I know. I have always envied him of a special connection I saw that he had with God. In the summer of the year 2000, I thought that connection was about to be completed.  I am sure that you guys have heard of my brother. He is autistic and has been that way as long as I can remember. He is three years older then me and my best friend. I can say this honestly after growing up with him for 17 years and taking care of him for the past 7 of those years.  My dad was still working for a sales company called Famillian that worked in selling AC units and the like. At the time, my mom was cleaning houses for various people around the county. She had to feed Chris by basically sitting on him and feeding him a milk based mixture that was given to him through a plastic eye-dropper.  That week, Chris would not eat a thing. My mom could not get him to let her feed him. At the time, I didn't understand the seriousness of this, but now that I am a little bit older, I can see what happened. Chris was about to die of starvation. My parents had accepted the fact that we might lose Chris.   Something miraculous happened though. Our neighbor, Patty, came over one afternoon to talk with my mother and she made a little suggestion. My mom said that she said "Maybe Chris just wants to feed himself" (something to those words) and my mom just felt in her heart that that was it. My mom started writing a recipe to give Chris many of the protein and nutrients he couldn't get before and she added it all in with a juice base. This is the amazing and miraculous thing: It worked. Christopher started eating again.  But that's not it. No, because nobody can outdo God, except God Himself. We knew that God had spoken through Patty, but another miracle was about to happen. My parents took Christopher to the hospital and I spent the night over at the Jenning's (Patty and her family) house. I'm usually pretty happy with my friends, but that night, I wasn't. I could feel that something wrong was happening. I just didn't know what.  My mom and dad took Chris to the emergency room to see if it was safe to keep him at home. The blood tests came back and praise the Lord everything was  NORMAL .  None of this should have been. His levels shouldn't be normal. He hadn't eaten for a week, but lo and behold, they were fine.  Of all the things that drove me away from Christ, this had to be the major decision in driving me back to Him. It took a full blown miracle in my life to see just how powerful God is. While I didn't start to earnestly seek Him until 10th grade, I know this planted the seed.  As I was walking past my brother's room, after asking my mom a few questions about that day, I see Chris, sleeping there in his room. Healthier then he had ever been. I praise the Lord for His grace. He is fantastic and I hope that God continues to work in my life through Christopher.   As I sit here, almost at tears, I realize why God did what He did. God could have called Chris back to heaven, to be with Him, forever whole. I know though, that that would not make me, me. Chris has taught me more then any human being ever has. He has taught me patience and compassion, understanding and joy. I feel complete with him because of his close connection to God.  Christopher is my brother. He is handicapped, and I know that God wanted Him to be that way to reach this soul of mine.

         You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."   Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian). The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood. His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Well, today was today (amazingly obvious, aren't I?)  Mathematics: We took a quiz today that I actually think I did rather well on. It was worth 15 points, but I really think I got all of them right. I might be wrong though, just because I'm Colin.  Before English we got the list of classes that we signed up for in the fall. Mine are as follows:  Fantasy and Science Fiction Composition 1A Composition 1B (year long class) Civics Economics Earth Science 1A Visual Basic Programming Adobe Photoshop Technology IWE Technology IWE (semester long class that I am taking for two semesters)  English: Why do we need to learn English when that is usually our first language? Anyways, we reviewed a little bit on The Great Gatsby, took a vocabulary test and watched a movie called the Legend of Bagger something or other like that. It was actually really good and I want to watch the rest of it. I am going to read the book first then watch the movie. Mr. Taber (teacher) told me that it is actually a rather large allegory.  The time of eating at around noon: We went into the computer lab and I worked on my project some more. Now the guy flies over the handle bars as he hits the little ditch.  Basic introductions to Computers: I need to ask myself this everyday: Why am I taking this class? Anyways I am getting to be almsot done with my project as I updated before.  After school, Lenny came over for a few hours. It was cool. We were having fun confusing the heck out of Melody! (or at least attempting to) We took a picture of his car. (see: Twice Double Avatar of evilpolitician2) We played a few games and the like. There wasn't much else we did. Oh! He tried to kidnap Casdo! (see my avatar on Twice Double: It's the duck to your right) he went home at about 6:00 PM  Tomorrow I get to do nothing! Wahoo!  My dad did say I can go to the movies on Sunday with Dominique. I can't wait I can't wait!   Well I have quite a long post in a couple of posts. Thanks for listening!  "[About the humpback whale]  Dory: Maybe he only speaks "whale".

       Well, I'm just tired of a few things and I wish they would stop, but the way it's looking, they won't. I can't really complain but I'm just going to be under a lot of stress real soon with crunchtime for school and all and I am just trying to get away from it all, but what I am ending up doing is creating more stress. I wish I could change all of this with a blink of an eye. Too bad.  "[Hanging on to Slim's leg in mid-air]  Flick: You've got to help me, I'm desperate.

       Well, I am kind of bored. Hope you guys are having a great day and I hope you guys enjoyed those last two posts!  Today was more or less interesting.   In Tech Assitant, I pretty much stayed there and did nothing. It talked to Melody online. (Melody: giq lew tiy siubf?)   We watched a movie in Biology called Contact. I kind of got into it and heard a quote that was really good.   "[Ellie challenges Palmer to prove the existence of God]  Palmer Joss: Did you love your father?  Ellie Arroway: What?  Palmer Joss: Your dad. Did you love him?  Ellie Arroway: Yes, very much.  Palmer Joss: Prove it."  I went into the computer lab during lunch and worked on my project. It looks cool and I will probably take screen shots of each individual frame to show you guys my superior art skills.   In U.S. History we had a scavenger hunt for historic events around Livermore. I actually found it quite interesting. Unfortunately there was no prize for winning, else the group of three (Me, TJ and Justin) would have got it. We got there first!  Anyways, that is all. Adios!  "Dewey Finn: [improvising some educational sing-song] Math is a wonderful thing. Math is a really cool thing. So get off your ath, let's do some math. Math, math, math, math, math.

And fifty-four is forty-five more than what is the answer, Marta?  Marta: Nine.  Dewey Finn: No, it's eight.  Marta: No, it's nine.  Dewey Finn: You're right I was testing you... it's nine.

       Well, today was work day and I am dead tired. I am also in sort of a bad mood, so sorry if this sounds really mean-spirited. For you long time readers, you know that I am not usually mean.

Well, it's 11:00 and I have nothing to do. I am not going to church tomorrow, so maybe I will post a LOONG Blog about something. I'm not sure what. I am starting to write a story, but I have already forgotten the first paragraph or so. Wait...I have just been informed that Melody still has it. *Posts it here*  "Quack quack duckie, quack quack." said the seemingly incomptent little human being.      Walco wanted to say: "You stupid humans, you wait, our race is superior to you. We will rule over you with an iron fist and take your children to prison camps. Your adults will be our entertainers, they will run around yelling "Quack quack." We will convert your duck ponds to sanctuaries and change your houses to training camps.

       Well, today has been a weird day.  Tech Assitant: My English teacher from last year came in with her class and she and I talked for a little while. I told her some of the classes I am taking next year and she told me that I would like them probably. She said she wants me in her journalism class 'cause I am so good at computers. *Ponders* maybe I will do that (whoa, I just took Melody's and Reeser's "Ponders"; *shutters* [Just kidding girls, I love you two!])  Biology: We dissected a rat. What else can I say? My hands still smell like Latex.  Lunch: We didn't go to the computer lab for once! Are you proud of me? It was closed actually. We kinda messed around, and Danny kept on spearing people with toothpicks. Pretty humurous. I need to get my own digital camera, just to take weird pictures of my lunch time. I think my readers would enjoy it after a while.  U.S. History: Well, what I was SUPPOSED to be doing was watching a movie and writing my comments. What I really did was talk with my friend about the dangers of getting intimate before a relationship. By intimate I do not mean sexual relations.   She likes a guy, who doesn't want to be in a relationship but they are at the stage of kissing, before they are going out. I told her to ask him out but (as some girls may know) the girl never asks the guy out. Trust me, the guy would much rather it be that way. You girls might get some brownie points for that.  Anyways. Erm. That's all folks.  "Coach Boone: Son, when I was 17 my dad died and I had 12 brothers and sisters to take care of. Now, I have faith in you and I know you can do this.  Sunshine: Right, I will do my best coach."  [later]  "Coach Tyrell: You had twelve brother's and sisters? Coach Boone: Eight. Coach Tyrell: You're right, twelve sounds better." --Remember the Titans (paraphrased greatly, I don't remember the quote and can't find it either)

       Every 15 minutes, someone dies of an alcohol related accident. Every  second  God calls upon us to make a choice. Whether to live for him, or live against him, there is no middle ground. I have chosen to live for him, yet I fail all of the time.   I have many friends, as some of you may know, but very few of them have made the same choice that I have. Today, I had to think of someone who means a lot to me, remember details about them, then I had to picture them gone. I pictured about a dozen people and only two stuck out far in my mind for me to remember.   Dominique; my girlfriend of 1 year and a half now was the first one that I remember thinking about. I thought about her gone and I know that it would change my life, I would live though.  Chris; my brother. Chris is mentally handicapped. We belive that he has autism. If I were to lose him, unlike losing Dominique, I would not be able to live. I know for a fact that I would just lose all volition to live. My brother means my life to me. Nobody knows him as well as I do. I just don't think that life would make as much sense. Christopher was the person who made me who I am. He gave me immense patience that even though it breaks sometimes, is incredibly firm.   As I sit here and hold back my tears, I learn that it's not possible. I can't not cry and now I think that I am going to go. Bye everybody.  "I can live without Lauren, I can't live without Tompanga." --Boy Meets World

       Well, today was pretty cool. Dominique was working from 10-3 today (meaning she did miss some school) so I went to visit her during my lunch. It was fun for the 30 minutes I got to be with her, but it is better then not seeing her at all.   Meaningful day? I wouldn't say so. I just kind of did nothing. Played a little AOE but kind of felt useless, as usual. I think I am going to need to brush up on my AOE skills pretty quickly. I dunno, I just feel like I'm there just to be there instead of really helping out.   And I'm done.  *Searches for a quote* I think I am going to compile a list and just put them all in a text document to bring out at need.  "Captain's log, stardate 23.9 rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We've traveled back in time to save an ancient species from total annihilation.

My mom said that she would try to remember to bring it by if she has enough time, but I don't think she will and she doesn't either. If that's the case, I will just have to call Dominique and tell her that I forgot. Sigh.  Anyways, I am so bored right now just sitting here in Tech Assistant drinking my Mountain Dew (which my dad says I have been drinking too much, but I have only drinken [drunken?] two in the past three day) Anyways, hoy. I shall be going now. Ta-ta.  "John Hammond: When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked.

       Well, I have a bit of a headache, but that comes from playing too many games all day. I think that I should probably stop playing so many games all day.  Right now I think I need to add my mood back to the left sidebar. I always thought of that as a really neat-o thing. *Does that right now and plays some cheesy muzak*  Okay I'm back. I just edited in my mood. Now that wasn't so hard...was it?  I am bored and I am thinking of some more features to put on the site to make it more interactive. Anything short of a message board tag thing (that's what I have TD for) is acceptable. If you wanna suggest something, feel free to put in a word at the comments. It doesn't even have to be blog related. I will just add it to a new section called "In-Site"  "Shooter: Just stay out of my way, or you'll pay. Listen to what I say!

       I read this on another  urlLink blog  and thought you guys would like it.  The death of common sense   Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend by the name of Common Sense who has been with us for many years. No one knows for sure how old he was since his birth records were long ago lost in Bureaucratic red tape.   He will be remembered as having cultivated such lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm and that life isn't always fair.   Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn) and reliable parenting strategies (adults, not kids, are Incharge).   His health began to rapidly deteriorate when well intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a six-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.   It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer aspirin to a student; but, could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.   Finally, Common sense lost the will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband; churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.   Common Sense finally gave up the ghost after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot, she spilled a bit in her lap, and was awarded a huge settlement.   Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust, his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. He is survived by two stepbrothers; My Rights and Ima Whiner. Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. If you still know him pass this on; if not, join the majority and do nothing.

       Well, I told you guys I would post something long and I intend to fulfill that promise, but first a word from my sponsor.  *Sponser speaks up with a clearing of his throat* "Hi."  Thank you sponsor. Okay, enough with the silliness, lemme tell you how my day went, for the most part. I got up this morning at 'bout seven in the morn. I didn't really get out of bed until eight on account of how lazy I am. I took my shower and then walked over to the church. (for those of you who don't know, I live like five minutes from my church making it very convienent for an excuse to get some exercise)  When I got there, Dominique, Samantha, My friend Mike (also known as "Myself") and Zach (or Zack; if you ever read this, correct me on that spelling) were all sitting at the table just talking. Dominique had bought me a Vente Strawberry Creme Frapuccino and I drank it all within fifteen minutes. I like those a lot, what can I say? Anyways, the lesson today in Pace Setters was very very good.  It was about  urlLink sanctification . It really hit home with regards to what I have been struggling with and I really enjoyed it. It showed me what sanctification really was (since I didn't actually know) and that I will learn to grow in him even more with this sin out of my life.  I was going to work in Special Needs today but Dominique (more on her later :)) told me that she would replace me so that I could go into church.   Pastor Larry spoke on some profound things that hit me pretty deeply. He talked about the impossible and mentioned a really good verse.  Hebrews 11:6 "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."  Maybe I will spend a seperate post on what he said exactly.  Now to Dominique. She is an amazing person. The best girlfriend I have ever had and, I would consider, probably one of the best friends I have ever had. She is always there for me and almost always understands me. I think that you guys would like her and I hope that all of you guys get to meet her one day at our wedding. (okay, just a bit of wishful thinking on my part: Both you all being there [which I am sure at least a few of you will be there] and us getting married [which many people have commented on the fact that that is a large possibility and they think it is very likely]) Many people have asked me how long I have loved her. Now, this is a touchy subject for most Christians in specific and people in general. I love Dominique but I don't love her. She is the greatest friend anybody could ask for, but I don't love her in the romantic sense. I really really like her in that sense though. She is a fantastic person to just be with and if anybody knows her personally, they would probably tend to agree with me. It is really hard not to be happy when being around her and it is hard to not talk either. She includes everybody as best she can and is the nicest girl I have had the pleasure to date.  Now that I am done rambling, please feel free to ramble in a comment...or something...like that...or in your own blog...about me I guess...since I'm such a fun person to talk to...riiiiight???? Okay, just kidding. Have a great day everybody, as T1 says "Blog to ya later"  "We will be perfect in every aspect. You drop a pass, you run a mile. You miss a blocking assignment, you run a mile. You make a fumble, i will take you and break my John Brown's foot up your hindside [wow, someone misheard that one...I had to correct it] and then you will run a mile.

       Well, I promised a long post, but right now I will give you a little short informational post on how I am doing.  I just finished Day 10 of my Setting Captives Free course (see below: "Feeling: Eh, alright I guess") and I feel different. It was about grace and how we don't deserve it, yet we get it anyways. The course showed how I could recieve grace and what steps to take to recieve it. I am now on my way to living right again with God. I know that this has not been an easy thing for me or for my friends, but I thank all of you for your support. I will be posting a bit longer of a post when I finish all of my homework.

       Well, I think I won't start this post off with the word "well." Actually, scratch that, I already did.  I wonder what it would be like to spontaneuosly combust.

       Well, Dominique and I went to Sears to get pictures taken. After that we went to Starbucks and she bought me a Strawberry Creme Fappucino (or however it's spelt; it's the only thing I will drink there) and then we wandered around for a little while (ate at McDonalds) and then we went over to her house.   While we were there we pretty much only did this one puzzle that we didn't get to finish (because she had to go to work and I had to go home) and that was pretty much my whole day.  Yesterday I played some AOE (Age of Empires) and it pretty much made me sick. Now I am okay and I will probably end up playing it later tonight. Well, that's all folks.  I changed my picture, but if you want to read what it says next to his head you are going to have to click the picture, then click the same picture that appears to view it in full-size.  "E.

       Well, eventually there is something I am going to address to all my readers but for right now, just be praying for my sinful ways.  Tonight was kinda cool. We had youth group and all the fun stuff that comes with it.  I led the crowdbreaker tonight because Dave was gone. (for more information on Dave, see lefthand side bar underneath "People") It went alright, but people kept trying to cheat so it was kind of frustrating.  School today was school today. I have to go into US History early tomorrow and make up a test, but I will try and post at lunch because I'm just like that.

       Well now, let's see. Note the new name. Old readers will now be able to enjoy the fantasies and realities of  Colin's Life  once again.  I have decided to discontinue  Twice Double   AS A BLOG . All this means is that  Twice Double Forums  is still up, the blog edition is now renamed back to Colin's life. I have more or less started with a new blog. I haven't posted in this one since around New Year's of last year, but I think we can all get over that.  Anyways, I have youth group, but maybe if I get back early enough I will chat a bit more with all of my old viewers and my new viewers. I guess you guys are readers too.  If you get bored, please, feel free to take a look at the archives. This is basically just my life from 2003. Thank you for your cooperation.

       Well, I have been over at Jennings helping them put their trampoline back up and boy am I tired. My fingers (well, finger) already hurt to begin with, and now my palms are all scratched up and the skin on my hand is peeling. Fun!  I went over there at around 10 in the AM and I started playing Risk with Chris, but then his friend came over and Chris kinda desereted me. So when we finished the game, I returned the favor by wiping him out.  There isn't really anything to do right now, so I think that I am just going to try and find Castle Risk on the internet. Yeah, that'd be great...well, that's all for now. New  urlLink  SB e-mail!

       Well, I just finished  Return of the King  and boy are my eyes tired. More then 3 hours (okay, not by much)...it was good, but I still liked the first one the best and I know I would like  The Hobbit  even better.  Today I went to the new library with Dominique and her cousin. Her cousin is a handful, but it was worth it just to be with Dominique. We were going to go bowling, but there was some tournament going on instead, so, after walking all the way from the library to the bowling alley, we went to McDonalds for a bit and then walked all the way back to the library.  Oh yeah; my fingers still hurt. It is real sad when you can't even grip a doorknob without them hurting. Man this sucks...

Oh! I passed out today...it was...scary mostly...  I got up to ask my mommy a question, and I asked her, and she told me...but about halfway through her answer, I felt really dizzy and such...I said "What..."...then I kinda fell down and hit my head on the cupboard behind me (I'll have to take a picture some time to show you guys more effectively) and I sat there for a few seconds then got up. My mom was looking at me the whole time wondering what I was doing and then I came to and asked "What just happened"  My knuckles still hurt from falling on them...owies. Anyways, that's pretty much all that happened today. G'day all!   "Daphne: Fred, do you think that I'm just a pretty face?  Fred: No. I mean... yes. I mean *not fat*. Definitely *not fat*.

I usually will be talking to myself and thinking out loud and other people will here what I am saying. 2. What color pen do you prefer to write in? Uh...blue? Black...I don't have any colored pens. 3. How would you describe your voice? I know it is not what other people hear. I hear it kind of high-pitched, but other people hear it low (I have heard my voice before when I wasn't speaking just then...it was weird.)

       Well, I had a pretty decent day today. My Nana came up from Merced, but I didn't really talk to her, mostly because she and my mommy went out to lunch. They gave me a ride to Starbucks and I bought a Vente Strawberries and Creme Frapuccino. It was good but I was done with it within the hour.   As I was walking home, Patty and Danny (neighbors) saw me and they scared me...but it was ok, because I didn't have to walk more then a few minutes! I went over there and talked with Danny for a little bit. Apparently he's getting a job at Dairy Queen. I told him I'd bug him while he was working occasionally. I still want to get a job at Game Stop, but I think that it would be a bad idea with all that I am doing this summer.  Anyways, I got home and played a pretty cool stick figure RPG but I decided that it would be best if I didn't play it for way too long, or else I'd get addicted. Dominique called me up and said she and her little cousin (Joseph, 7) were going to the movies. So I took the fastest shower I ever have (less then 5 minutes I think), got dressed fast, grabbed my skateboard and headed out. We went to the Regal and saw Garfield. It was pretty corny, like I expected, but I think that I'm not going to go to the movies with a little kid anymore.   Anyways, that was pretty much my day. I'm sitting here eating popcorn and being kinda bored. Please leave a comment, all donations to the furtherment of the genius of Colin will be kindly accepteed; thank you.

       Well, I don't just mean physically ('cause that's a given...) but it is really hot in here.   I am currently working on a game (as you guys might know) and I am almost done with it. I just need to work out the random dispension of bonus's and inhibiters and I need to figure out a point system for two players (I don't know how I'm going to do that one) and I need to figure out how to make people lose lives seperately. I have big huge plans for this one! I am also going to make a cool chess game and figure out some kind of twist to it to make it my own. I don't know what yet, but I want to be a game pioneer! I'm going to try to make old games really cool! (Not that chess needs to change; I'll take any of you all on...if you have pogo, add ecclesiastes2111 to your friend's list and I will be happy to play ya!)  Anyways, I just wanted to let you guys know, so if I sound frustrated on the phone/on AIM it's probably because my game is being stupid! Anyways, thanks for reading now the get-up noise. *Gets up*  "Annabell (as Tess): She is dead, worse than dead.

       Well, sorry guys! I haven't posted for a while...here are the mutterings:    Colorblind:: Lizzy!  Shallow:: I'm afraid of water  Erotica:: I don't even want to hear it anymore  Figment:: Have you ever heard of the color qwijybo? Or maybe it's just a pigment of my imagination!

California:: That's where I live!  Bond:: Shaken, not stirred    My friend Sasha had a graduation party and I went to it because I had nothing better to do...just kidding! It's cause I love her! Dominique went and we gave both Sasha and Sarah (her twin) cards from Dominique and I (I still can't believe that Dominique signed it "Dom" she hates that!) Dominique made me lick the envelopes! She's such a princess! (A beautiful, sweet, kind, cute and awesome one at that!) Hmm...that could be a problem.   "Sultan: Rules are rules and the rules say Both: You must be married to a prince." --Aladdin  Darn, there go my hopes and dreams. I can't marry Dominique, I'm not a prince! Oh well...maybe she'll marry me anyways!  Anyways, the party was a lot of fun...We (Dominique, Samantha and I) watched most of Blue Streak, but we had to go before then. It was funny, but they cussed  a lot  in it. Dominique and her mom and my mom and I are all going out to lunch on Tuesday! I can't wait, I can't wait! I'm bored, I think I am going to go play chess. Have a great day everybody; comment comment comment!  "B.E.N.: ...I'm beginning to see my life pass before my eyes... at least, I think it's my life...

That's the movies that I use for quotes. Treasure planet wasn't a very good movie..although, I wasn't paying much attention to it (Melody! Don't hurt me! I was a good boy, honest! :-P)  P.P.S.

       Well, it's Sunday now. We got home last night at nearly 9:00, but I didn't want to go to bed right away, so I watched the rest of the seminar that I had started that day. Here are the mutterings for today.    Charity:: Faith  Scale:: 1 inch = 1,000 years  Jennifer Lopez:: Who?  Coercion:: If you do that, I'm gonna kick you!  Meter:: Stick  Pressure:: System!

       Saturday: This was the actual day of my Nana and Papa's anniversary (50 years). My mom and my aunt (known as Leslie from here on out)and Dominique (if you guys don't know who Dominique is; she is my girlfriend of nearly 2 years...I think that it was pretty much implied that she and I are dating) all went to the park where the barbeque was taking place and set up all of the decorations and the like.   I stayed home and watched Chris for a little while. I started watching another one of Kent Hovinds seminars (I'm almost done; I only have about one more to go) Then they came back and picked me up and we went over to the park to celebrate!  It was cool, I saw a few of my aunts and uncles that I hadn't seen for a while and I met some that I had never seen. People kept on commenting on how tall I was. I kept thinking "Who are you?" But never really said that. The only distant relative I remember is my Uncle Dick. He used to tickle me when I was younger, except I've only seen him two other times besides today. It was pretty cool. My whole family is in love with Dominique now. I wish I was.  I just realized I didn't put a quote for the last post. I will do that in a second.

       Well, I am going to split my weekened up into three different posts. Please, if you don't read it all, I encourage you to read it sometime.  Friday: School was neat, during computers we got to make our own game, which I am going to continue to do today and the rest of this week, it's fun stuff. I have to get a few kinks worked out, but I am hoping to get the game to be pretty fun and then eventually I will release it on TD or something.   I watched a debate for a little while after school, then when Chris got home we went to go pick Dominique up from Loard's. (an ice cream store; where she works) We drove up there and it was pretty funny. I can't remember, but I think Dominique fell asleep for a little while. (it's an hour and a half drive) My Nana bought us all McDonalds (and I ate 16 chicken nuggets and a large fry) and we sat around and talked for a while while my Papa watched baseball.  We all went to bed at about 12 in the morn, but since Dominique and I were seperated, I couldn't really talk to her...so guess who did? My mom.  The next morning, Dominique told me they were up until 3 in the morning. No wonder they were all tired.  "Cody Banks: All her classes, isn't that kind of creepy?  CIA Director: Creepy?

       Well, I just got finished watching another two hour seminar by Dr. Kent Hovin. He is very good.  Anyways, I wanted to tell you guys about something. My friend  urlLink Mike  started a blog called  urlLink Christian Teen Issues . He included me in on it (nice guy) and I am now the Vice President (appparently; didn't know until just recently). Well, I am hoping that this will strengthen my faith in God. Right now, I have nothing much more to say. I will talk to you all later.

       Well, last night was not too fun. Dominique wasn't there and because of that, nobody really talked to me. I'm not saying it's Dominique's fault, I am saying that the friends that I have aren't really my friends much if they only talk to me while I am around Dominique. That's all many people even care about anymore.   "Friend": Where's Dominique? Me: She's at work. "Friend": Oh, okay; bye. *They walk off* Me: Bye...I guess.  Well then, that's real fun, now isn't it? I don't know how many of you guys really know how that feels, you may or may not know. I'm going to go now.

       Well, I was feeling pretty bad for quite a while, then a few friends of mine told me that I need to get alone with God.  This is directly related to my struggles that I told you about a long time ago. I think that Satan has started to feel me slipping from his grasps, so has started to attack me in another area completly.   I have always believed that God existed. Today though, during Biology, I felt that God didn't. That there was no way that He could and that really got to me for the rest of the day, whether I noticed or not.  I prayed to God for about a half hour, asking for understanding and knowledge on what to do. It may seem kind of odd that when I am doubting His exisistance I go to Him for guidance. That is easy to explain.  I know that it is Satan who is trying to get me to doubt and I know that God  does  exist, so I know that I can go to Him for help. It was only at certain times would I doubt God's existance.  One of the things that God revealed to me was that I could count on Him to help me. I sincerly cried for God's guidance and the Lord showed me what I needed to know. He strengthened my belief in God and showed me how I would know. Which leads me off to my next point.  I was lying on my bed, crying my eyes out, and I asked God a specific question: "Is Dominique hindering my relationship with You?" I got an immediate feeling of calm and completly stopped crying and knew right there that God was telling me something. This is where I am actually having problems the most. It could go both ways, that God was telling me "Yes" and calming me to get my attention or that He was telling me "No" and calming me to relax me. How would I possibly know? Well what I felt that He was saying was the latter, but I really need some insight. Anybody who reads this, please, either e-mail me or post a comment on any insight you might have. I really need it.  Anyways, I am doing much better now, but I am still kinda' hot. (it's really really stuffy in my room) Hope all of your guys' days are going well.

       Well, I did not get much sleep at all last night. I woke up like every hour or so, and one of those hours I woke up in the hall. I was sleepwalking last night. All I can remember about that is that I was dreaming that I was in another place entirely and that I wasn't supposed to be, so I snuck back to my room. Weird though, I can't remember the other place anyways.   My fingers are all soft and stuff and they keep on slipping on the keyes making it quite hard to type without making a typo. Stupid typo bunnies! *Smashes them* sdfghasdf h...I missed; darn.  Anyways, I am bored. So for sure now, Dominique is coming with us to my Nana's and Papa's on Friday. It's gonna be fun. My mom, Chris, Dominique and I are all going up on Friday afternoon and Derek (maybe Amy; his girlfriend) and my dad are coming Saturday. Saturday is their actual anniversary. *Is so excited* I get to see my cousins! Wahoo!  And I'm done. I will be talking to all of you later. Have a great day and a fun time at school. Bleh, I'm bored. Get on AIM if you want to talk. I'll be on for another 45 minutes.  "Bridgekeeper: Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.

       Well, I haven't blogged in a LONG time. I'm only going to blog the Whatever Wednesdays and tell you that I will not be on at all tomorrow. I'll be at the church all day long.  1. Culturally, what defines a person's gender?   The way they act towards certain things. No matter what though; your gender is defined by what you look like, not by what you do.  2. Does your mood define what you do, or does what you do define your mood?  The former.  3. When making lists, do you prefer numbers or bullets?  I try not to be prejudiced, I try to use them both equally to not make the other feel bad.

        Broken A short story by Colin Walker   &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Have you ever been heart broken? So sad just becase someone has left your life, and it seems like they won't ever come back? I know exactly how you feel, it's happened to me as well. A long time ago, a friend of mine died.. He was unjustly murdered by some who didn't understand him. My friend died saving my life. Those who killed him wanted me dead instead. My friend stepped in and took my place. He died instead of me! Before this friend came into my life I was in bad shape. I was lonely and wretched, lost and forgotten. After I met this friend, I learned that he died protecting me after.  &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;If you have ever missed somebody so much that you felt nothing could replace that emptiness, remember my friend. Sometimes I break down crying because of his sacrifice. Nobody can replace that hole he made except him. After all, he is God's only Son, Jesus.

       Well, it is 2:30 in the afternoon and I am kind of bored (as you might be able to see, due to the fact that I'm going to blog about something that I messed up on)  I was supposed to have piano lessons today, but thankfully my teacher was not home. I am actually getting tired of taking lessons, but I'm not quite sure why. I still like playing the piano. Anyways, we went over and I got my haircut for Senior Pictures tomorrow. Whoopee! When I get them, I will scan one and post it. I went to Starbucks and got a frappuccino and now I'm at home bored.  I had a bit of a problem with the blog for a little while today. It seems that I was stupid and ended an HTML tag wrong. As a result of that, I thought it was a template problem, so I completely restored that and then lost my comments. If you guys want to leave more comments, go for it! You can even scroll down to previos days and check out what is there. I wrote a story a couple of days ago and in a second I will post it. I'm going to put it in a different post so you guys can see the difference between the posts. I'm really bored right now and I want you guys to get online! Sheesh...what's a guy gotta do around here to get some friends to talk to?  I played  urlLink Metroid Prime  for a little while, mostly because I was bored. I beat it a couple of days ago and now I'm trying to beat it 100% on hard mode. I figure if Lenny can do it, I can do it!  Anyways, that's all for now kids, have a good day and eat your vegetables.

       Well, let's just say that I am doing much better then I was a couple of posts ago. My friend and I worked it out.   Dominique and I worked in special needs today! It was really fun! (reminds me of when she and I first started going out; we worked together a lot then too) When I got home from church the Jennings and I went over to 7-11 to get some M-Dew. Yum!   We went over to their house and they taught me how to play Stratego. It's pretty cool and if any of you guys have played it, you know what I mean!   Well, that's all! Talk to you all later!

       Well, I am feeling the worst I have in a long time. Right now, I wish there was someone I could talk to, but it appears that everyone has just abandoned me. I have nobody to talk to; not even Dominique. I am trying&nbsp;my hardest to turn to God and I know He's hearing me, but it doesn't feel like it. I am in a state of remorse so badly that only God can help now, but it would be nice to know I have some friends who will back me up. Right now, it feels like I have nothing.  &nbsp;  Right now I do not know what to do and wish I had some guidance. Apparently I didn't do something right and a friend of mine got upset at me. I don't know what I did or what they feel like right now, but I wish that friend would just talk to me. I pray for this friend almost every night and I know that they are going through some rough times. I just wish I could do more.

       Well, I just got back from Disneyland earlier today and am just now sitting down to the computer to talk about it and I realized a couple of things. I don't really want to tell much about it until I can put the pictures up and show you guys a little bit of what I did and its a half an hour until 11 and I would rather just sleep!  I had a decent time there. I will go more into depth tomorrow when I get on the computer. I think Derek is going to work early tomorrow so I will be able to get on whence I wake up.  I'm back on the computer so expect to see me online.

I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.  Rose: You're crazy!  Jack: That's what everybody says, but with all due respect miss, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here  --Titanic

       Well, see that picture to your right? I think I am going to take a new picture of me, I just need to do a few things first, like post in my blog (oh wait, if you are reading this I already did that now didn't I?)  Today was an interesting day and I might tell you about what actually  happened  later. Right now I would like to share a song with you and do a little song interpretation and what it means to me.    So Close    I'm so secure. You're here with me. You stay the same. Your love remains here in my heart.  So close I believe You're holding me now. In Your hands I belong. You'll never let me go. So close I believe You're holding me now In your hands I belong. You'll never let me go.  You gave Your life and Your endless love.  You set me free to show me the way. Now I am found  All along You were beside me even when I couldn't tell. And through the years, You'll show me more of you, more of you   What I really want to direct your guys' attention to is the second verse. It says "You gave Your life and Your endless love."  This really struck me because I have been living the wrong life. Ever since I was maybe 10 years old I have had a problem dealing with what I view on the internet. I tried to stop once by completly unplugging my computer, and that worked for a short time, but then when I got really bored, I would just go onto my parents computer and look at pornography there.   Recently a friend (whom will remain anonymous, if he would like to be known who he is, he may comment on it) of mine had set me up for a prank. I was supposed to put in certain information about myself, and then I would be paired up with the perfect girl. (now I was pretty sure that this was moot and that it wouldn't really be accurate, but I never really knew how moot it would be) What ended up happening is they asked me a few personal questions: Do you masturbate? Do you view porn? I answered honestly to both questions (yes) and the whole thing ended up being a joke to get that information to my friend. Well, I confronted him about it and he helped me out.  He sent me to this website called  urlLink Setting Captives Free   (link opens in new window)  and I started taking the course for freedom from porn addiction. I have been doing very well in my opinion and I have started to step by step fight this addiction of mine.   I just wanted to let all of those know that I am not a perfect person. I am not "Mr. Christian" and I am not "Mr. Pure." I fell in this area  hard . Very hard.     Other then these things that I have struggled with, my day has gone pretty well. I had Tech Assistant, Biology and US History. I had a test in Biology and I think I did fairly well. I also have to remake a test in US History that I keep forgetting to do. GRRR I make myself mad sometimes.  I will continue to blog here because it is a place where I know I can express my true feelings and if people don't want to hear about it, they don't have to read it. For anybody who is reading, please please please post comments about what you read. Any questions and I will do my best to answer them. I really like hearing from my readers and I want to know what is going on with them. Thank you for your time, I shall talk to you later.  Cop: Do you know why I pulled you over?  Fletcher: Depends on how long you were following me.  Cop: Let's start from the top.  Fletcher: Here it goes: I sped. I followed too closely. I ran a stop sign. I almost hit a Chevy. I sped some more. I failed to yield at a crosswalk. I changed lanes at an intersection. I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light and SPEEDING!  Cop: Is that all?  Fletcher: No. ...I have unpaid parking tickets.
