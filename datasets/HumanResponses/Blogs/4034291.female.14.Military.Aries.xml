      WOW so yesterday at about 5:30 I went to my friend Anna's house in Minneapolis. She lives in Germany, but she comes to stay with her dad every once in a while. So we got there and we ate this weird thing it was like canteloupe with curied ham wrapped around it. so yah i ate that and bread and me and anna just kind of hung out and talked about music and shit like that. Later her dad, Fred served steak and chicken and hot dogs and some other stuff and we ate that. GUESS WHAT! I HAD A DOUBLE CAFE MOCHA AND TWO DOUBLE ESPRESSOS! AND I WAS SO WIRED AND MY HEART FELT FUNNY CUZ I USUALLY NEVER DRINK COFFEE AND OMG I THOUGHT I WAS SOOO AWESOME CUZ I DRANK COFFEE!!! how cool is that. man, i love coffee. so after that anna made me run arond the block to wear off some of my energy and then we went inside and watched some old episode of VIVA LA BAM which i FREAKIN LOVE! it was the "dont feed phil" ha. so after that we just hung out and shtuff and i slept over unplanned and we were awake till way way way way way late and it was fun and umm yah. today i cleaned out my closet. that wasnt meant to be ghetto like that eminem song, i really did clean out my closet. that was a hell of a job. so yah that was my day. how cool was that.
