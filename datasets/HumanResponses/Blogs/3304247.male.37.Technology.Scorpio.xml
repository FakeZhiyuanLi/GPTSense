						   I'm still blogging. :)  Had a good weekend.  Getting close to the end of my church's AWANA (www.awana.org) year.  Lot's going on. Right now we are organizing for an Award Ceremony and year end party.

						   My 9 yr. old, Hunter, had batting practice last night.  I threw about 40 or so pitches to a couple of kids and I now know I am really out of shape.  (I knew that before, but you never want to admit it.)  My shoulder is sore.  I thought my elbow would be, but it is ok.  It was great excercise for me.  Got me breathing and broke a good sweat.  I am thinking of getting a bucket of balls, and keeping me, Hunter, and Jonathan (my 5 yr. old T-Baller) busy hitting this summer.

						   I'm on to _Wizard's First Rule_ by Terry GoodKind.  This a also a reread.  A very good book.  I am not so sure I can say that about the subsequent books in the series.  More Later.

						   I am currently reading _Phoenix_ by Steven Brust.  This is probably my third reading. I have a soft spot for Vlad Taltos.  A small guy in a land of tall aliens.  He delights in taking jabs at them and winning (most of the time).  A human  in an alien society, learns how to live and thrive. He finds he has a knack for larceny and crime.  Something fairly respectable for a human.   This being the 5th book in the series, we see that Vlad is very good at being a crime lord though he can't quite grasp that he has his bosses who can squash him like a bug if he steps out of line.  I highly recommend Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos books.

						   One of my favorite sites.  Visit and read.  Post/Comment.  Let me know what you think.   urlLink Christdot   The site owners are fairly liberal, but many posters are much more conservative.  Even an atheist is there (a good thing).  Everyone is very good to one another much of the time.

						   Well, my oldest son lost his baseball game last night.  He did pretty well. He is developing a good eye for balls and strikes.  He walked both times he was up to bat.  Yeah, 2 at bats means a pretty bad game for them.   Church this evening at 7pm.  I am a deacon at my church.  I'm a Baptist (Southern).  It's a small church and I like it that way.  I'll discuss why another time.  You will see a lot here about my faith.

						   So, you are thinking, who is this guy?    Just a regular guy with a wife, 3 kids, and all that goes along with a guy, with a wife and 3 kids.  Just a taste of my evening.  My 9 year old has a Little League game tonight at 7:30.  He has to be there at 6:30 to warm up (throw to warm his arm and bat to get his timing).  My wife also works, so one of us has to get home in time to get him there by 6:30. Not too tough usually, but it can be hectic at times.  My mom is in the hospital right now, and I will go by and visit for a few minutes before heading home. If I leave at 5pm, I should be home by 6pm, get a few bites to eat and off to the ballpark.  I really enjoy the games, so I don't mind the hectic pace in the spring.  One thing that does bother me is trying to divide time between my 9 year old's baseball games and my 5 year old's teeball games.  Teeball is boring!  But I have to support my 5 year old.  So far, there have not been any real conflicts.  We also have an 11 month old (birthday on the 13th), that is a live wire. She's daddy's girl. :)  Enough for now.  More ramblings later.

						     The Atrocity Archives   This looks good.  Below is a review from www.sfsite.com  A review by Rich Horton   Advertisement         Charles Stross has received a lot of well-deserved attention and a few Hugo nominations for recent stories like those in his Accelerando sequence, and for his first novel in book form, last year's Singularity Sky. His first published novel was actually a serial, in Spectrum SF in 2001-2002, "The Atrocity Archive." This story is now in book form, with a sequel novella to expand a shortish novel to more typical book length.   The novel is a neat mix of horrific fantasy -- demons and Lovecraftian monsters and the like -- with smart contemporary SF. Add aspects of spy thrillers and Dilbertian office comedy, and throw in Nazis and nasty Islamists and a very secret branch of British Intelligence. It's told very wittily, though the central horrors are still pretty scary. The overall tone is snarky and fun, not horrific.  Bob Howard is working on a desk job for the "Laundry", but he's bucking for field service. We meet him on his first trial, breaking into an industrial building to destroy the traces of a dangerous discovery a young mathematician has made. It turns out that certain kinds of math knowledge lead to the ability to summon demons from other universes -- the sort of thing once done with chalked pentagrams, but much more efficiently achieved with lasers instead of chalk, and with computers to keep track of the summoning rituals. It's the job of the Laundry to keep such knowledge under wraps.  But aside from the dangerous job, the Laundry is just another Dilbertian government job environment. So the first few chapters show Bob dealing with bureaucratic hassles: stupid bosses demanding silly paperwork, dumb training classes, computer problems, etc. It's all very funny stuff. He's also dealing with his crazy sometime girlfriend, and his weird roommates. Then he gets sent to California to try to pry a beautiful redheaded Irish scientist from the clutches of the US -- it seems she might be studying some dangerous stuff. But his mission turns bad when she is kidnapped by some Islamists who may have bitten off more than they can chew. Before long, Bob is posted to a more curious part of the Laundry, with a boss straight out of classic spy fiction, and it looks like they might be dealing with a secret Nazi project -- or something even scarier...  The Atrocity Archives is a very breezy, fun, and imaginative novel. Structurally there are a couple of problems -- basically, the opening, though always entertaining, drags on too long. The novel proper doesn't start until about a third of the way through. But that's a minor issue -- overall, this is great fun.  The added novella is called "The Concrete Jungle". It is a separate work, not an expansion of the novel. It still features Bob Howard, this time investigating the sudden appearance of a bunch of concrete cows in Milton Keynes. The cows may once have been real -- thus a case of "gorgonism" is suspected. Worse, there is a possibility that someone has figured out a way to automate the basilisk effect that turns flesh to stone. Howard and a new, unwilling helper brave great danger in tracking down the eventual villains. There is more bureaucratic satire here as well, and it's snappily written and clever throughout. Still, though I enjoyed it the story doesn't have quite the impact of the novel -- perhaps a matter of length, or simply that the novel was first to present the ideas. There is also an introduction by Ken MacLeod and a smart afterword by Stross that compares the spy thriller and horror genres. The Atrocity Archives as a whole is definitely to be recommended.

						     A Time Odyssey: Volume 1     Stephen Baxter and Arthur C. Clarke   Description: (Blurb) For eons, Earth has been under observation by the Firstborn, beings almost as old as the universe itself. The Firstborn are unknown to humankind— until they act. In an instant, Earth is carved up and reassembled like a huge jigsaw puzzle. Suddenly the planet and every living thing on it no longer exist in a single timeline. Instead, the world becomes a patchwork of eras, from prehistory to 2037, each with its own indigenous inhabitants.Scattered across the planet are floating silver orbs impervious to all weapons and impossible to communicate with. Are these technologically advanced devices responsible for creating and sustaining the rifts in time? Are they cameras through which inscrutable alien eyes are watching? Or are they something stranger and more terrifying still?The answer may lie in the ancient city of Babylon, where two groups of refugees from 2037—three cosmonauts returning to Earth from the International Space Station, and three United Nations peacekeepers on a mission in Afghanistan—have detected radio signals: the only such signals on the planet, apart from their own. The peacekeepers find allies in nineteenth-century British troops and in the armies of Alexander the Great. The astronauts, crash-landed in the steppes of Asia, join forces with the Mongol horde led by Genghis Khan. The two sides set out for Babylon, each determined to win the race for knowledge . . . and the power that lies within.Yet the real power is beyond human control, perhaps even human understanding. As two great armies face off before the gates of Babylon, it watches, waiting. . . .

						     Ronald Wilson Reagan. 1911 - 2004   I sitting down to eat at a restaurant Saturday evening when I heard that a great man had passed away.   Ronald Wilson Reagan was the first president I voted for.  My political view of the world developed through the Jimmy Carter years and I was not happy with the where he was leading us.   Ronald Reagan was a breath of fresh air.  I distinctly remember Reagan as an exciting person.  A person with a message that I personally needed to hear.   I did my senior year high school government class project on Reagan's second run for the presidency.  I was so proud to be able to do a presidential race.  Kids only had a chance to do a presidential race every four years and I was lucky enough to get President Reagan to boot.   Those years of his presidency are some of my fondest.  High school, and college.  Cares and responsibilities at a minimum.  My whole life before me.  His outlook matched mine.  I thank him for his can do attitude about this country and life in general.   I have followed him over the years about like everyone else.  I would hear news reports of his health and think fondly of him.  I know, I and many more, will always think fondly of him.     He was one of our greatest presidents.   I will miss him.
