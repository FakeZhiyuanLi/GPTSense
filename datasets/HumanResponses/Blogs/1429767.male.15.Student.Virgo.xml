      look everyone im 14 years old freshmen in highschool, im gay but no one knows it yet. i am not a popluar kid, i am depressed an i just feel that i need to share my troubles with other people so i just get them out and know that some one might just be reading it, kind of a sense of therapy you know what i mean? i am, as stated above, refering my self to as john doe because no one needs to know what my real name is because it is very possible somebody i dont want to read this will, uncloaking my true identity that i am so scared of! I will also not use any of my friends names just for the reason i dont want to be found out.....

      you know i was looking through my brothers yearbook from last year, and now i know that i shouldnt have done that, everytime i look at it it makes me want to cry because i see all of these popular kids having a great time in high school smilling laughing having fun. i would love to believe that i could actually be in one of those pictures someday because i am dying to have fun and fit in with the "popular" people no matter what the cost, i want it so bad that i am willing to give up my present friend which i know i shouldnt do. it just hurts so bad to know that i could be having all that fun but yet im not. All i want is to fit in and have fun and have a yearbook picture other than just my regular picture is that so hard? i need to have a feeling of love of many people. but since im gay i will probably never accomplish that because i am too busy trying to cover that up i have no time to work on my social skills, i feel that if i could come out of the closet i would be one of those kids in the yearbook having fun and loved my all. but coming out of the closet is going to be so hard yet so easy once i do it, the problem is building up the courage and knowing the right time to do it if i can pin point those two things i will be happy with myself. everyday i feel closer and closer to coming out yet farther and farther away, i am dying to do it in highschool becuase i want to be able to just you know let myself free and allow myself to enjoy life instead of trying to cover up who i really am and allowing all of my social skills to suffer while i am too busy covering up what i should let free. i could talk to jenny about this becuase she is gay and im pretty sure that she might have and idea that i might be gay yet im not sure i know i could talk to her about my situation its just i dont think she sees me that way, the way i truly am. coming out is such a touchy issue i just wish that if we are gay we could just be born that way and have everyone know about it at birth so we dont have to worry about the depressive problem that we will always face. this subject only adds to my stress. if only i could come out without ridicule and hate i would already have come out a long time ago, i mean like maybe even the 6th grade, i know it sounds early but thats when i realized that i was gay and accepted if id o accept it all at this point its hard to tell now... i feel so confused i just wish that i could bring myself to talking to someone like mrs forentino but she is off getting a degree but she says that she will be back, she is the only one i really trusted and the only one besides maybe jenny that i could trust today. omg i cant stand it anymore someone just help me its tearing me up even worse than the davey thing becuase if i came out now it would change my whole life and the way people feel about me greatly than anything could ever do. if only the world was a place where people wouldnt get picked on. ok this is all that i can really think of on this dilema if  you will right now i just want to be known for who i am...... Yet i dont want to be.... fuck it i dont care anymore.........

          My Belief In God  Is there really a god, someone to watch over us and to guide through the night when we need it most? Or is it all just some mass misunderstanding? Mayber there is, whom which doesn't help me or at least I dont feel that “he” does like some others claim. Some say that Jesus has helped them in one way or another but he certainly hasn't me, I'll pray and pray until I can't pray anymore and what do I get? Nothing at all, it's not like im asking him for a million dollars or something but it's just little things and stuff like that yet he never sends me a sign or some how makes me believe that there is some one watching over me helping me through the rough places in my life. For example, I prayed every single night for Josh Gracin to either win or to at least be in the top three even so he could get a recording contract, and what happened? He got voted out almost like there was no god guiding him through it all. Weeks before I prayed for him (right around the time he was in the bottom two for the first time) and he did horrible the week following so I prayed extra hard and he wasn't in the bottom two, then the week he left AI2 he sang like an angel, just what I had prayed for. Then I prayed for him to stay and now he's gone. Maybe those first two positive turnouts were a sign for me, which I did not acknowledge. All that I ask is he just send me a sign or something telling me that he does exist and that he is willing to forgive my sins and help me get through this oh so rough time that I am experiencing right now. I'm not saying that I hate him or anything just that I will not choose to worship him faithfully or pray to him every single night until somehow I get a sign that he loves me and that he is there for me for every walk of life. I guess all that I can do is look to the heavens and hope that someday I will meet the all so mighty one if he does truly exist...

      hey everyone hows it hangin 2day? im in a bad mood today... first of all josh got voted off of amercian idol last week and i miss him so much its like loosing a friend, it tears you up inside well i know that he'll move on to better things and all its still a heartbreaker especially when he brought his little girl brianne up on stage and started to sing to her it was awesome... "I want my life to be.. yeah.. to be with you to live with you..." that line right there makes me cry everytime i hear the song "You dont know what its like.. Baby you dont konw what its like.. To love somebody to love somebody!" that was also awesome! Check out this  urlLink  site its for josh if you like him (cmon u know you do)  . Josh has been on TV alot lately and he has been singing on alot of the shows he did like on regis he sang "I'm Already There" by Lonestar you should listen to his version of it sometime its an awesome song even though i dont like country i love all his songs which are all country so im sure ull like it.. Second, i hate my family. my mom hates me because i dont do pot like all the rest of my family its embarassing really to know that youre the only one in your family that doesnt smoke pot and be hated because of it! my mom treats me like shit all the time she doesnt even listen to a word i say to her she focuses her attetion to my brother who is a partier. for all she cares i could be in the corner slitting my wrists (which i have done before) while she is praising my brother for being a pothead, no is that wrong or what? it just drives crazy! it makes me want to just yell out "you fucking pothead why dont you pay attetion to your son while he kills himself instead of praising your pot head son!" i cant take it anymore! i should just stop writting this shit coz nobody reads it well that i know of...

      i fucking hate this world no one seems to like me everyone i ever meet just pushes me away. the person that i love hates gays just the other day he told me he wanted tourture every single one of them.  no one seems to understand me for who i really am, no one loves me therefore i can never express true love, im ugly, im a classic nerd, im gay, im chubby, and im fucking depressed. my friend ian is the only one who understands me simply because he is gay himself and has dealt with all this himself in the past but how can i find comfort in him he lives in la. you know i watched this movie called good girl it was good movie, a nice depressing one. its about this girl who cheats on her husband and tries to make everything normal again, but ends up screwing it all up in the end kind of anyway really. it relates to me so much because every friendship that i have i end up screwing it all up. i hate my life so much the world is hell, you know how people say that there is hell on earth well there is no such thing because earth is hell its a horrible place there is no good on the planet, well at least i cant seem to find any, my parents hate me so that rules them out... ian maybe the only good on this world he understands me, i love him but yet i know that he doesnt love me because im too young for him and he probably thinks that im an ugly bastard like everyone else that thinks that it is funny to pic on me just because of it. you know i cant handle this anymore its all eating me alive anymore its horrible i cant live a true life all i want to be is cute, in shape, and find someone to love that isnt a complete asshole. you know what i mean? its horrible how one can go through life and never experience love before because that is how im going to be for i dont know how much longer i can live through this....

      When life seems like an endless fight, And death too far away, You dread the day and live for night, Though night's more dull than day,  You thirst for more than what one day gives, But from the cup of life gives all, Don't think of how another person lives, For it's up to God to make the call,  When days go by, and not much change, Look at your world thru different eyes, Though it may seem out of your short range, Not everything in life dies

      Here is some of my work... Im really depressed now for some reason that I do not know. When I'm depressed I like to write so here's one of my favorites.   A dying rose, A hopeless cry, A falling leaf, A blackened sky, A sudden releif A drop of blood A deafening silence... Brings a veil of loss Confirming the certainty Releasing those demons from your soul Allowing time to forget you So this is it- End. So this is all- End. So you wanted to die- End. Beautiful one, always the happy one, You can't avoid the darkness falling Across you now You can't ignore the bitter cold Overwhelming you now Because now there is nothing left, No one is there Its all there is but it was  Gone long ago.  Hope you liked it. If you didn't then you're smart enough to know I'm a worthless piece of shit that no one loves. I will be forevermore the boy that no one loves.

      I found a poem on Bolt that I would like to share with you right now. I think that it is truly amazing its awesome, I know I couldn't have done better. Here it is thanks to Kristen:   All these voices inside my head  more often than not, wish i was dead  Something keeps telling me theres something wrong  but deep inside i knew all along  Ive been forced against my will  and been staring out my windowsill  ive wanted this for a long time  actually appriciating what is mine   Finally figured out we're all the same  life is a wreck, one hell of a game  love can be painful but not in my case  my kinda love is a bad thing to waste  he's been there through thick and thin  telling me not to give up, that one day i'd win  i love him so much words cant explain  even on those days i feel so much pain   just like the time i felt used  just like the time when i was abused  i'd sit and cry alone  the air seemed stiff, cold, and silent to the bone  i wanted to go underneath that rock  when indside my head the voices would knock   They'd tell me not to end it  but my heart was never mended  i tried to take my own life away  i left people speechless, without a word to say  the blows were hard, they hurt like hell  further further then down i fell   amazing isnt it? I just love this poem I cant stop reading it. Thank you again Kristen....

      Depression is not exciting or intense. It is not extreme pain, nor is it the flowing of rivers of blood. It is not screaming and crying. It isn't romantic or expressive. It has no poetic beauty, none of the magic in death and pain. It is the absence of all feeling, masquerading as every sorrow in the world. It is nothing, yet it has none of the beauty of infinite blackness. It is beyond suffering, it is an eye without tears and a soul without substance. It is indescribable yet it describes everything. Don't think that because you have cried and bled and hate yourself you know how I feel. Your pain is coloured and tangible. It gives you a refuge and a comfort in times of need. Mine is an all consuming emptiness that bleached my soul and darkened my eyes. Don't say that you understand me. I have been to places you could never even imagine, and survived. Yet I am not a survivor, I am an empty shell filled with bitterness. Don't label yourself depressed because your wrists are scarred and you cry at night. It you felt like me you would bleed to fill your empty soul, not to release your pain. Red and black would be the only colours you could grasp from inside the nothingness, not those you preffered for their intense expression. You may have felt infinite pain but you have never felt nothing, never fallen into the void. So never say you know how I feel until you know what it means to feel nothing. I do not fear the castles of grief and torture, in fact I often seek to rebuild them - anything to fill this empty grey land that is draining my essence away. You say that depression is the ultimate pain - where the screaming reaches a crescendo. It is not, it is the place between joy and sorrow where the barren grey wasteland stretches to the horizon and beyond. You cannot write songs or poems about depression. It is not the feeling of being numb, it does not hide feelings, it obliterates them, leaving a gaping hole through which the wind howls. It is the dark night of the soul. It is death within life, and I am the living corpse.

      Hey everyone, if there is somebody out the reading this (there probably isnt because im a complete looser). Well I guess things might be looking up just a little bit for me right now! There's this guy that I like (not Ian) his name is lets say ummm Joe (fake name) this guy i know for a fact that he is gay because last year around fourth of july i was at a party and he went into the house and two of my adult friends (not that kind you perv) were talking about how they were looking at the history on the computer after he was on it and they found some gay porn sites listed so that right there just basically made me want to yell YES!!!! hes gay! so anyways he was over memorial day weekend and he was kind of oh i dont know flirting with me in a weird way like he would call me something just to have me call him something back then he would laugh you know stuff like that so I would do the same and he would kind of do that "i love you" look but im not sure i dunno. well then last week he sent me a actual written letter which was unusual because he used to just send me email well in it it said maybe we could get together sometime in his hometown and chill for a while almost like he was asking me on a date yet it was just to chill. so i dont know if he likes me or if thats just the way he decided to act around me or what i really hope that he likes me because i think we would be perfect for each other. we are both depressed so we could help each other through the rough times that might come along, that would be cool though because then we could support each other and cuddle when we are sad or something. this whole thing just kind of uplifts my spirit almost making me happy again even though just last year it seemed like i was never going to be happy unless i was dead, dont get me wrong though i still have that thought in the back of my head of wanting to die its like it never goes away but maybe its a sign that i should take my life so i can be happy and free someday when i go to heaven or wherever you go after you die. but then if i take my own life i might discover while im wherever i go after i die that joe really does love me and i have hurt him really bad by taking my life but then if i stay alive maybe he well pretend to like me and then really hurt me somehow just for shits and gigles... i dont know maybe someday ill figure it out, but until then... bye everyone

      ive really fucked up now. i told the one that i loved that i dont deserve him. it sounded right when i said it but when i told him it was the worst feeling in the world he just emailed me back saying he could never forgive me for what i have done to him. so now it seems the only way out of this horrid hell that i live in is death, hopefully it comes soon though to end the suffering once and for all. i dont want to feel pain anymore i just want to be numbed of any feeling forever. not having to deal with any pain anymore. i cant do it i have to do it. why is it that i fuck EVERYTHING good in my life up? it is hell i tell you i am such a fucking idiot to have done that him i could have been with him i dont understand why i did it i love him and i always will but now he doesnt love me. i had to be a fucking retard and fuck everything up.   Perfect Story  Here I lay forgotton, body brittel & cold, all my thoughts of anger, race through a mind thats old...   Although I'm young at heart, my body feels ancient, now all my dreams seem to be so tainted...   Now my soul will follow, an unwritten theme, chasing lost images, that are never to be seen...   Running down a forgotten path, trying to find myself once more, getting lost in my past, only hoping that it wont last...   But my past is soon trapt, in the future to behold, now I have the perfect story...   NEVER TO BE TOLD...

      Here is some of my latest work... i'm feeling kind of depressed right now i just want to end it now without hurting the ones i love.   Behind closed doors In my bedroom You can’t see my pain I sit there and cry But what about, I can’t explain I have these feelings Once in a while I can’t seem to let them go I only wish you could understand these feelings I only wish you would know I hide this pain I hide my tears Because I am afraid I don’t want you to know I am hurting That I am going through this pain That’s why I shut you out Because sometimes I don’t even understand Why I feel this way, why I am so sad When I feel this way, time can only make me better But I only get worse And every time I have these feelings I wish I weren’t alive Because sometimes these feelings get too deep And I’m afraid I won’t be able to hide them anymore I only wish I could let you know Because I need someone to understand my pain But I feel like nobody knows how I feel Nobody feels this way So behind closed doors I will stay Until I can understand why I feel this way

      Hey people out there... I haven't posted in a while and right now things are horrible i feel they are sometimes anyway. Well first of all we had a family reunion to go to and I had the greatest time of my life! So that was good, I was happy for the weekend until it was over. I met this Kid that was a friend of one of my cousins, who I will refer to as dave, it was almost like a dream being around him because he is everything I could ever ask for in ANYONE! I'll call him Steve for now... Well at the reunion we would hang out, walk, talk about all types of things, and have a great time. Steve is awesome bacuse he is so polite to everyone, he's cute, and above all he can be serious yet he can be hillarious and he always knows what times to be which. Well me and my other cousin (i'll call her ashley) were all hanging out with each other on the beach and we were talking, it was great because Steve really seemed to like me as a person. But I couldn't really feel confident about myself because for one I have severe Acne, I weigh more than I desire, and I have a speech impetament. It was so hard because he would think I said something I didn't or he would ask me to keep on repeating things. It made me feel horrible because I know he had to of disliked those things, and if he disliked those then he would dislike me even though I am trying REALLY REALLY hard to keep the weight off because I eat alot (whenever I feel an unpleasant emotion I begin to binge then feel horrible about it and go back at it). Another thing about Steve is that he is only 12, I know it sounds sick and he's too young, but when I first saw him I really thought he had to of been older than me just shorter. Even when I began to socialize with him I would of guessed him to be at least 16 because he acted really mature he wasn't acting stupid he was acting intelligent, which I believe he is. So if you think about it he is really 16 because he looks like it and he definately acts like it. He is the most mature person that I have ever meet! Which goes to show that really he is perfect for me. Another thing is that he is like a leader because our whole group of people that we were in the whole time he wasn't afraid to be a leader for us he would say let's do this and we all did like second nature. All that was pretty good but this is where I begin to become depressed. To begin, I don't really know if he knows his sexuality for sure yet, but he might being so mature and intelligent. Second, he is more than likely straight with my luck of the draw. Finally, I will probably never communicate with him again and if I do it's not going to be until another year or two. I blew I could of asked him for an email address or something but that itself brings up the whole sexuality thing with me. Dave might not bring him next year again to the reunion because Steve kind of hung out with me and Ashley not him, so that might of made him think that he doesn't need to come next year. It makes me scared to death to think that someone who could be "the one" may never be in my life. Yet another good thing I like about him is that he is somewhat insecure so that makes me want to jump out to him and love him and tell him how awesome he really is and to stop being so hard on himself all the time. I guess all that I have to say is that I love you Steve come into my life please! if you read this use this email address for comments because i cant give out my real one so please just send them to lil_ian_dude69@yahoo.com because it is my friends address I'll get it don't worry. I just really want someone to talk to right now!

      you know i have always told myself not to worry about what other people think about me, i firmly believe in it. yet i find myself trying to impress this boy i like Trevor he has the most amazing eyes i go into like a daze everytime i look into them he is really sweet too but you know he has a girlfriend but yet he throws out signals that he might be gay or something i so desprately want him to be gay and to like me but could I ever get that lucky? my dream is to just spend at least one night with him even if we dont have sex he means much more to that because i cant even jerk off to him yet i think hes hot so i guess that goes to show how much I love him. i guess, though, that maybe i should just give up on trying to find someone that i can truly care for and know that they truly do care about me also. Trevor is the only one that makes me happy anymore i look forward to computers class everyday i have it because I sit right next to him and ms brooks doesnt care if we talk. if i could have one wish in this whole world, anything at all even eternal life over Trevor i wouldnt even have to think about it i would pick Trevor right then and there because its like in the fellowship of the ring arwen tells aragorn that she would rather face one life in this world than face all the ages of this world without you. i cant stand it anymore its like tearing me apart inside, even to the point into depression even though i love him so it makes me depressed to think about him because the way life is treating me right now it would seem that he would never like a person if at all a boy for that matter. the thought of him one day just leaving me out in the rain or making fun of me with out kidding around is enough for me to consider suicide, funny isnt it? we want to end our lives just for a certain person just because we loved him, i guess it does make kind of sense because love is the most powerful thing in the universe, without love nothing would exist. I cant take it anymore i want him so bad, maybe i should just tell him how i feel but then he would just like hurt my feelings from which i could never recover eventually leading up to my death... will i ever find someone who loves me back if Trevor rejects me? but what if i did kill myself over Trevor and it turns out to be another romeo and juliet where i kill myself just to have Trevor follow and when we get to heaven we realize that we could of just said something to each other and we could of lived in love with each other for the rest of our lives. havent you ever noticed that it has always come down to 3 simple words that kill so many yet offend many others "I love you". why cant i find the strength to tell him how i feel, maybe its because i will get beat up by everyone in the school and be teased worse than i have ever been. love is supposed to be a beautiful thing isnt it? then why does it hurt so much? am i the only one that feels this pain called "love", or is there thousands of others out there that love someone yet are hurting so bad. i need someone to love as a boyfriend. Trevor is the man of my dreams but he tears me apart inside by me not knowing if he likes me back. I guess that this is just another example of how bad it feels to love someone deeply that may or may not love you deeply back. even if Trevor doesnt love me at least he could spare me our friendship so I could be blessed with the fact that he does like my personality somewhat just maybe he isnt gay but hes ok with me liking him, hell he might even get a kick out of the whole thing. you know writing this has brought me to tears, maybe i need help... no, not maybe, I DO need help! Fuck this world and this life, there's nothing to look forward to but death but then what after death? nothing?

      today was a snowday, its pretty bad out there. there's drift that no one has been through yet on my road that is deeper than i am tall! thats a pretty big drift, no wonder why we didnt have school today. so far the day has been going by pretty fast and i havent been able to talk to anyone yet today so im hoping that soon someone will get their but online because im getting lonely again, not like last night though i was extremely lonely last night i cried! well things are going a bit better today if they says anything... i was thinking of something to post on here but since i have no life there really isnt much to say on here so maybe later on ill post something more, after i get the chance to talk to some people! i feel like im in solitary isolation right now its driving me nuts!

      Darkness floods my room at night And the emptiness of being alone A chill passes through my heart And through tears my longing is shown Where are you when the darkness lingers? When I’m curled up next to nothing Where are you when a breeze blows through? And I’m desperately needing something?  Alone is the word that describes my life When I’m living it with out you All that could be good and make me smile Only dims in the light of the truth What good in enjoying a movie If I’m not cuddled in your embrace? What good are late nights or early mornings If they don’t end and begin with your face?  The realization of your absence is intensified And normal activities hold new meaning Every trial I endure and every victory I win I find myself wishing that you were seeing If luck should caste me a favorable lot Can I really rejoice without your presence? And if my life should turn for the worse Is not the pain numbed in the wake of your absence?  Light floods my room in the morning And the emptiness of being alone The warmth does not quiet reach my heart And even in brightness my pain is shown Where are you when the day shines through And I wake up clinging to no one Where are you when a breeze blows through And I’m desperately needing someone?

      today wasnt actually all that bad, people, for the most part, thought my hair looked pretty cool i didnt get to school early enough to do the blue so i'll have to try again tomorrow if we have school that is! i hear that it's supposed to snow heavily tonight with about 2-3 more inches with snow continuing into tomorrow with another 4-5inches! yay! lol in biology we had to carry our eggs without the shells and luckily mine didnt break! then we had to weight them and all that shit then we just worked on our terms, so it wasn't too bad. in french we just went over some vocab and did a little recap on what we have done so far... Il neige beacoup en hiver! lol im such a dork. in computers we tried to force mrs welke into ordering some pizza but didnt have any luck so we just worked on chapter 2 labs, i got caught listening to music again, o well she didnt do anything so i'll just do it again wednesday. at lunch nothing much happened k8lyn wrote me and she wanted to know if i got the nudy pics yet, well i didnt but im not worried about them, besides i already know that he's a total hotty! mmm lol k ill stop now... in history today ryan thought that my hair looked pretty cool, we took more notes and found out that we have another test friday, thats like a test a week! its insane! he's gonig too fast i think! we had to read these really old books so i drew a cock in this guys mouth w/ cum splattering all over lol.. im so immature, alysia thought it was funny though! after school i had to go back to the dentist to get the one filling fixed and then get two more done, so my mouth is really numb right now, he said that my teeth are too soft or something so now i have to use floride everynite, its not so bad, the mint flavor tastes like spearmint gum, but it leaves a film on your teeth so you have to brush them like an hour after you use it which is kind of a pain, but hey whatever keeps me from getting these damn cavities! i wrote a bit of poetry today, i think one of them is kick ass, i called it alone and in the dark, its awesome but i forgot it in my locker! how dumb is that? lol o well ill have to post it tomorrow or something. we finally get our report cards in seminar tomorrow so i can see how bad i did, i know i failed my math exam so i wont be going on to the next level of math next year so im not worried about it. i only have to take us history, english 3, adv. biology, and a seminar since im going to  VOTEC  that way i can get ahead for college and i heard that i can earn up to like 50,000 a year right out of highschool! that is soooo awesome... told courtney today that i was gay and she took it pretty well so far, ill have to talk to her at school or something... tonight for homework i have advanced algebra, french, and some reading to do out of my lit book so i'll probably finish up on here and then call eric and get cracking at it... well until tomorrow all you ppls lol

      RRGG! i am sooo pissed off right now at my mom she just keeps making stupid comments at me and they are driving me nuts! last night she was talking about how i should go to woodlands and blahblah.... w/e! i cant stand her, she is such a hippocrite, i told her that if she makes me go there she's coming too because she has the same amount, if not more problems than i do! she is like physcotic sometimes and no matter what you do it doesnt make her happy so it's like what am i supposed to do? be your little bitch to make you happy! i should send her this post, that would really make her mad! last night i was feeling really really bad for some reason probably because i was being a jack ass or something, idk... sometimes i wish that i could just go hide somewhere and be left alone for a while! i dont even want to go to school tomorrow, people are going to piss me off probably and then ill just have to beat them up lol i doubt it but i know im going to get mad for some stupid reason, i always do... im thinking about writting some poetry today, it'll help me a bit i think ill post it on here once i do it....

      haha i just took this quiz its freaky...   You represent... loneliness. Always alone and always sad about it... unlike angst, you don't have to look for a reason to be miserable.  You want to be in the company of people but aren't sure how to act when you're with them.  Sometimes you have to make an effort.  You can't always wait for others to come to you.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Today i didnt have school! yay! i dont really know why we had one though, we didn't get the 4-6 inches or w/e last night, but today i heard we are going to get up to 6-10" with severe blowing and drifting, so far today it doesnt look like we'll get all that much, its a light snow now, enough to lower driving visibilty and its extremeley cold, only 8 by the thermomiter on the tree outside, but that thing is ghetto so it's probably off by quite a bit. so far today my day has gone good, im not too depressed today, im just more neutral right now, kind of bored... i watched open range today it's a pretty good western, im usually a fan of westerns but this one was exceptionally (ooo big words, watch out!) good. it was kind of hard to get into at first but as it went on you'll get into it a little bit more. i talked to josh today he's not up to much so i might end up swinging by his house if i can get a ride and just chill over there for a while or w/e. hopefully we dont have school tomorrow either, i hate friday schedules, they are too hectic for me, plus you have to take all of your books with you pretty much... well i suppose i better go my mom needs the phone so i'll more than likely post tonight sometime.... im going to write a few poems today too so ill post them definately....

      today was ok i suppose, it started of REALLY shitty though. The battery in my brother's car died so we had to jump it w/ my mom's car so it made me late for school! i was extremely tired in biology and we had to watch some stupid ass movie so i tried to catch some z's but the damn thing was turned up really loud! so that kind of sucked, i went into french class today and found out that i had an a- for the semester so that made me feel a little bit better, then i found out that we could pick our seats for the new seating chart so it wasnt all that bad... then in computers mandy transfered in (a freshman) so thats awesome, she's really smart and is really deep into things, so yeah if i wasnt gay i think i would go out with her! all we really did in computers is took notes then typed up some worksheet defintions (about 64 of them) they werent too bad since i was listening to simple plan the whole time *sings along to i'm just a kid* YAY! I LOVE SIMPLE PLAN!! they are sooo cute lol... yeah i just realized that this post really just jumps around and makes no sense at all! isnt that just fine and dandy! o well i'm a looser... anyways, in history all we did was talk about the Patriot act and then took notes, alysia transfered into my class and sits by me now. on the bus nothing much happened i just listened to my cd player and thought about things, i was thinking when it would be a good time to tell josh about my sexuality, since he is like my brother its going to be hard i think even though sara said he wouldnt care its still nerve racking (spell?). and my parents, i know that they will be fine with it since one of their best friends is a lesbian, shes like a second mom to me, she offers to pay for everything but i always tell her to shut it like the asshole i am coz she needs to keep her money, not spend it on me! o well, she's awesome well i better go, american idol is on and the oc comes on afterwards and i love that show, i'm sooo into it! well ill post later maybe...

      well i suppose i am starting to feel a little bit better, dont worry just give me some time and im sure ill be back in a shitty mood in no time at all... i found out my filling is cracked all ready and i just got it yesterday, it hurts like a bitch! o well i go back monday to get it fixed again so hopefully it'll last...  i think im dying my hair this weekend but no garuntees! i hope i can coz it'll be awesome if i do! i might get my ears pierced too! i want to get these cool earrings that look like you have screws going through ur ears, itll be awesome! they are only like six bucks from hot topic so thats cool. tomorrow i have all my "good" classes if you want to call them that, not much of my classes are really that good except computers, its ok. i found out today that when i go to VOTEC next year i only have to take english 3, adv biology, us history, and seminar at the highschool, so thats like awesome, i should get a 4.0 next year! yeah right that a crock of shit, but w/e...  i got the red hot chili peppers greatest hits cd the other day from my bro is a kick ass cd so go buy it or d/l it or w/e u do. also another good cd is called permission to land by the darkness its ok the songs are kind of weird, kind of like mindless self indulgence, but its ok... umm yeah im blabering again... well ill post tomorrow.....

      today was another one of those days, maybe it's just because i'm back in school and to be honest i dont really feel like being there right now... in english today not much really happened we got a new seating chart and of course i dont sit by anyone to really talk to again, well amber is kind of close to me but we cant really talk that much, courtney is on the other side of the room again... *sighs* i guess i'll manage. In seminar we had to practice the MEAP's and it was really stupid i just basically blew it off, Josh kept making me laugh so i guess that's pretty much the hight point in my day. in math we got another seating chart and i sit at a table with caroline, amber, and jolynn so that's cool, so if i need help i have some people to help me at the table so i dont have to deal with the stupid teacher that hates me! o well.... i havent really had a chance to talk to anyone that much so im kinda down. in art today we got some new kids, they seem pretty cool for the most part, i seen someone i liked in there ;) so that's a good thing i suppose, i would much rather have sonny or that one freshman kid in there! they are both sooo cute lol well i better go im waiting for melissa to give me a call... i'll try and post later...

      today i was feeling good until i went to the dentist, he put me in more pain that i was before i went there! that asshole! Im in one of those moods again, for no reason at all either, i just feel depressed and like no one wants me around. these kind of moods just make me want to go back to bed and spend the rest of my life there, they suck. i dont understand, though, why i am in a shitty mood now when i was all hyper and having a great time talking to some friends last night? its like i slept on the wrong side of the bed... idk ill get through it though, i think its a certain someone that made me feel like this but i wont mention names right now, just give me a while and i'll tell you all about it! im waiting to hear from melissa i wonder what she has been up 2? lol well thats it for now...

Exams are finally over and im thinking about telling josh this weekend about me being gay im really nervous about it but sara said she talked to him about it and then he said it wouldnt make a difference to him so i was like COOL lol... Well i guess i lied when i said that everything is ok eric has been having some problems with his ex and last i talked to him he was about to kill himself and i tried my best to talk him out of it and i talked to him later that day and he seemed much better but i havent heard from him in 2 days so im really really worried right now! idk what i would do w/o him because hes the first person that ive actually like and not just for his looks either, he is awesome! he was the first person i came out to and i know about his sexuality and all and this is the first guy ive known that i could actually have a chance with you know? well maybe you dont but if he goes i just might have to too... well i better call him and to everyone that reads this garbage: email me im bored! rohdy2006@hotmail.com! o and dont forget to check out melissa's live journal at http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hoodratfairy

Im worried though, not about melissa but of telling other people about me im not sure if im ready yet i want to so bad... well thats all i can write right now because people are annoying me... thanks melissa youre awesome!

      I just finished the book Loosing Matt Shepard, it is by far the greatest piece of literature that ive ever read, it is deeply moving, even if you are straight, even if you are homophobic it will make you question your outlook on life. before i read this book i felt as though i knew a great deal about Matt's story but as i got into the book (about 10 pages in) i realized how ignorrant i was to his story, by far the most moving point in the book is "In dramatic and widely reported testimony, Fluty would later state that at first she thought Matt could have been no older that thirteen, he was so small (Matt was only five feet two inches, barely over one hundred pounds). And when she described Matt's brutally disfigured face, she said that the only spots no covered in blood were the tracks cleansed by his tears-an enduring image that continues to appear in essays, poetry, and song dedicated to Shepard.... Kreifels told police and reporters that he at first thought Matt was a scarecrow flopped on the ground, maybe some kind of Halloween joke staged a few weeks eary. No matter its provenance, the notion that Matt had been strung up in something akin to a crucifixion became the starting point for the repporting action to come." If that doesnt make you cry then i dont know what will. matt has become a symbol, a symbol for tolerance, and acceptance. Matt was brutally beaten and left alone, when he arrived at the hospital the doctor that treated him said that his face was beaten in at least 2 inches on his right side i believe and that it was amazing that he was still alive. the only thing that matt ever did was admit he was gay to McKinney and Henderson at Fireside bar one night, they talked him into leaving with them and then proceded to drive him to the outskirts of town and pistol whip him all while he was begging for his life, stole his shoes and his wallet and planned on going back to his apartment to rob him of everything he owned, they didnt make it back to his apartment, instead they ran into two hispanic men and fought with them which one of them recieved a head injury and were being treated in the same hospital matt was, only 2 beds away from him... matt's story will never be forgotten by the world this is all the more reason to allow gay people to get married, we deserve the same rights as all americans, the gay college group had pins that said "straight but not narrow" that they handed out to the straight students, dont be a shallow person, hate the sin, love the sinner... matt's college homecoming parade was dedicated to him, it started out with about 200 people but as it went through town people began to join, it was estimated to have over a 1000 participants in the end, no one even spoke they just walked, walked for matt it was a beatiful thing to do... Phelps (a homophobic) attended matts funeral and picketed, the crowd just turned their backs to him and his followers and sang amazing grace so the shepard family didnt have to hear his filth. at mckinney's trial phelps also picketed, so members of the local gay group dressed up as angels with big sheets draped over pvc pipes for their wings and stood with their backs facing him refusing to talk they just stood their and cried, censoring the world from his filth... even though i never knew matt, i feel as though the world lost a close friend, he was a complete stranger to me but when i heard his story there was nothing but sickness and deep sorrow in my heart for him, it is as if i lost a family member... rip matthew shepard we will always remember you, now and forever....

      today went pretty bad, i lost the ball in my earring sometime during the night and i couldnt find it for the life of me this morning, so now i have to get another earring and wear this one until i get another one becuase i dont want my hole to close up... it looks really stupid right now, just a hoop with a big gap for a ball, o well ill live... once i got to school things went pretty smooth i guess, nothing too terribly exciting happened today and i dont really have much on my mind so this post will be short... i think that im going to see my grandpa at home on sunday up in paw paw.... i cant wait until spring break rolls around, i'll finally get to enjoy some nice, warm weather and i think we might go to six flags over texas once we get down there... its going to rock! my hard drive is scheduled to be here tuesday which works out quite nicely, since i have a half day ill be here to sign for it and then i can just slap it in my pc and go about installing xp and linux... well i guess i might post more tomorrow or tonight whatever...

      today was actually pretty good, save the three hours of it that i did homework, but science olympiad was a blast we just chilled in mr lyles room and launched some tennis balls in the hallway and stuff... yeah it was fun... science olympiad is only a week away from monday so im like totally excited about it! i meant to post some poetry today that i had on my usb drive but i think i have it in my locker at school so i might do it tomorrow in school, im not sure if ill get the time though, just have to see what goes down and play it by that... it wasnt anything spectacular though, i think i've written better.... my neck is killing me today because of excessive homework i think, so now i will probably have to take some ambien to fall asleep tonight, im not going to do what i did last night, i didnt fall asleep until about 4 and i woke up at 615, i couldnt sleep for the life of me, i was super tired when i crawled out of bed so i just drank 4 cups of coffee and drank 2 pepsis at school and i was ready to go.. mmm i love caffiene, its like fuel, without it i would be a heap of sleeping shit, yeah im just a tad addicted lol.... well i guess thats all i have to say for now, im kind of hyper for some reason probably because im glad to be done with homework for once.... well thats it...

      i was watching the oc today and it was kind of sad really towards the end if you think about it hard enough... ive been super lonely as most of you know for the past couple weeks or so, i dont even know anymore, and im pretty much sure i wont be in a serious relationship with any guy by time i graduate and that's not exactly making me happy. ive said it a million times and i might as well say it again, THERE'S NO GAY PEOPLE HERE! josh says that there is more than you think but i doubt it, because you can pretty much tell when someone is gay, the way they act and such. he was supposed to show me someone in courtney's yearbook who told him he was bi back in 8th grade but couldnt find him so that really wasnt good at all... anyways back to the oc, towards the end someone said, i dont remember who, that if you know something's not going to happen then just let it go and hold on to the next best thing, and i was thinking that i should try that, i know im not going to find love so i should just stop obessing over guys like justin and eric because i know that i have no chance in hell with either of them its hopeless... so ill hold on to the next best thing, my friends, they arent the same as true love but they are the best next thing. its still going to be hard because i cant spend time with them the way i would spend time with a true love, i mean im not talking about anything sexual im just saying that i cant hold a friends hand and tell everyone that im going out with them and say i love them and all that kind of romantic mushy stuff because i cant go out with them... well anyways... in history today we were talking about a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages, and to my suprise the majority (about 95% i would say) of the class support gay marriages, they all said that there's nothing wrong with it yet they can see what the other oposing side is saying... becky made a REALLY good point... she said that the previous 26 amendments stand for liberty and equality and if an amendment like this is made the 27th, what would the others then stand for, bullshit? she also said that we need to show tolerance for gay people and mr stanger said in reply that if the government will allow the KKK to hold marches and say all black people will burn in hell through public places, and allow doctors to kill innocent babies and not think twice about it? then it shouldnt be a big deal to allow gay marriages, and if people say that gay marriages should be banned because of the "damage" it would do to morality should just think for a second, why dont they outlaw the kkk? is the kkk not damaging morality, society? if allowing doctors to take innocent lives doesnt hurt society or morality what does? why then is it such a big deal to let gay people get married?.... i decided to write to granholm and upton about this topic in the near future once school settles down a bit, its time for the underage teenagers to be heard, let us all be heard loud and clear!

      yesterday was a really bad day, i kept forgetting just about everything that was really important for me to remember, im such a dumbass! the day started off good, i woke up on time and all but i was extremely tired so i was just like sitting in class in a daze most of the time so i really didnt learn anything. and im thinking that i have a test friday in history but im not sure, i hope we dont because we took tons of notes and discussed the chapter yesterday and i dont remember anything from it. so im pretty much screwed if we have a test. today has been a little better so far, i didnt get my history project taped so im like screwed on that deal too, i think i might just have to perform it in front of the class which i will HATE to do, i hate public speaking! o well, courtney said that her mom told her that she should be able to have that hotel party, maybe eric could come or something, that would be cool, her birthday isnt until the last day of school so its a long ways yet before it can happen. thats going to be crazy to have the whole gang up there, i can see us now running through the hall and messing with each other... o its going to be great! lol i was just thinking that there has been a lot of drama around the school lately, first steve quinn's little sister died and lots of kids knew here at the highschool and mr comfort announced that he will be leaving the district after this year, i dont have him because im not in band but all of the band members say that the field show is going to suck now because he will be gone, and thats a shame because the field shows are awesome! o well hopefully there will be a good replacement so they wont suck. well thats it for this post....

      today was a pretty good day for the most part. i ended up staying at josh's house friday night and we just chilled around the house and watched fuse all day today, last night we went down to mill pond and walked around on it, there was some weak spots in it but none of us fell in so it was pretty strong. it was neat to be in the middle of mill pond and look off at the highway and in the distance there was a cell phone tower, kinda made me think how in the not too distant future there wont be much wilderness left, i love wilderness except i also love the big city scene so i dont know where i would live when i get older. my brother is moving out (matt) he moved his bed and such today, he will be living with a buddy named derrick, he needed someone to help pay rent since his roomie moved out and matt said he was tired of living here so he moved in. in july i will be like an only child, my brother will be off to basic training for the summer and matt will be moved out so ill just have to learn to put up with the parents by myself... im going to tell jeanne (my neighbor's gay daughter and my parents close friend) about my sexuality tomorrow and see what she thinks about coming out to my parents because im really getting tired of trying to hide things and all, its not really too fun to be able to tell your friends who you really think is hot and ur family thinks you like girls or at least i think they do... courtney might have a hotel party over at amerihost for her birthday i dont know when that is but i think its pretty soon, im definately going, im going to try and see if eric will go too but i doubt he will, i dont think he likes me anyways, its a long story and i really dont feel like talking about it right now... that would be awesome if he did though we could get a room together and fall asleep in each other's arms, we wouldnt have to have sex, it's going to make me depressed to know that i probably wont be able to do that anytime soon. o well... josh told me today that someone told him that they were gay back in middle school but he cant remember the name, supposedly hes a junior so im going to ask courtney to bring her yearbook from last year so he can point out the person to me, he says i know the person but i cant think of anyone who is a junior and meets his description o well... maybe i'll have a chance with him, right now im extremely desperate for a boyfriend, no one in this town would ever go out with me i wouldnt think so its like of no hope to find one soon. o well i guess im done for this post theres more i wanna talk about but i dont feel like typing anymore so ummm yeah...

      this week really wasnt a very good one for me, even though it was a short school week it still wasnt very good. i guess today will be better though since i am going uptown and the weather is warm, too bad its not sunny or i would be happy i suppose. i swear as soon as i graduate high school im moving out of this town, there is nothing here for me, except for friends, but i need more than that i need someone to love. it drives me crazy being single, single and gay isnt exactly the funnest thing in a town where you're the only "out" gay person thats a guy... valentine's day was just about hell! well i guess ill stop blabering and all... hmmm today in biology all we did was talk about DNA oo fun fun! in french we learned another verb and how to conjugate it we also learned some food vocabulary so umm yeah that was extremely boring! i wore my pants today, the ones with all the writting, they are pretty pimped out lol... i feel like im kind of distracted writting this, i cant get out what i really wanna say for some reason so i might post later it all depends on my mood

      i finally got my ear pierced i got it at 14 gage over at point blanc in south bend just past the state line. i got this really cool hoop earring that has a lil ball on it i love it! lol it really didnt hurt that much and it really doesnt hurt now its just a bit sore, im about to go clean it right now... so ummm yeah... i had to get my birth certificate to get it done though because they had to see something proving my age so we went all the way back to cass to get it then back over to the place to get it done, it only took about a minute or two to do the actually piercing. im thinking about getting the other ear done once this one heals up so that'll be in about 6 weeks or so... yesterday i was in another bad mood people were driving me crazy i just wanted to be left alone and just go back to bed and lay there wishing i was with somebody again, man i'm pathetic! it seems like every once in a while i get really depressed and lonely, yesterday was one of those times, my mom said that that's the way she is when she's not on her meds so i might end up going on some soon i think but she doesnt know that im gay so maybe not... i talked to eric today and he wasnt up to much im trying to see if he will come to dowagiac sometime so we could hang out somewhere, hell maybe even have a party at the hotel and have him come along w/ a bunch of friends that would be like super awesome! but yeah i dont think he would come but hey it would be worth a shot, maybe someday i can have a party there, it would have to be for my birthday though, its the only excuse i could use to have one... although everyone would have to pay for a room, maybe i could have a sleep over camp out thing in the field behind the house that would be cool but i doubt he would want to go... well i guess thats it for tonight i'll post more later or something o and check out the jeremy botter blog link i have, he was on cbs news, hes in kuwait now i believe so you might wanna read it, its really quite interesting... well bye everybody

      I cry as the moon fades from the starlit sky.  My heart breaks  My soul aches  As I collapse with a sigh  Such exquisite pain  That burns in my chest  The last star has fallen  I have spoken my last  Take me now sweet shadows  Leave me to my sorrows  And I, the last star of twilight,  Shall die. ***************************** This breaks me within myself.  This shatters my heart.  Full of cries.  Full of lifelessness.  To a shore of night.  To a scar in sight.  The tears are violent in cries.  The misery is poison.  To fill my veins.  To seel my eye.  With a shining tear.  With a single drop.  That fill my soul with sorror to die.  That pain of cries never dies.  That sign shows a light I can never reach.  I'm falling from the sky  I'm falling to the sea of fire.  That has my last word.  That will burn me with fire.

      today for the most part really wasnt that bad... at josh's we just chilled and went over to jordan's for a while to hook up a system for him then shot some pool for a bit.. when i got home me and the family went out to eat at wahoo's and i had a michiana burger, i ended up eating only a few bites of it and drank a glass of pepsi because i wasnt in the mood at all to eat and im still not in the mood to do anything really except crawl into bed alone like i always do and then never wake up... boy would that be nice! actually im in a suprisingly decent mood seeing how its valentines day and i couldnt talk to eric today... things are sort of looking up for me at the moment, but who knows, with me it could all go downhill before i even go to bed tonight... and "anonymus" why dont you just use your name i know who you are and honestly if you dont approve of me being gay or whatever then dont talk to me because really i dont need to worry about dealing with you too, i have enough on my plate right now... and if you say that homosexuality isnt natural then i guess i'll be un natural ill go to hell or whatever... i dont really care. im not going to change either so whatever you say to me or whatever you do to me it wont change a thing about my sexuality, its already too late to change anything about that, im pretty much secure with it and i have no doubt in my mind what so ever... so anyways... i found out the freshman i like name his name is justin, he's sooo cute plus he went to ozz fest so that is like wicked awesome (sorry i stole ur word melissa) lol melissa asked him when we were in mr brosnan's room for science olmpiad.. now i just need to build up the courage to talk to him sometime and maybe hang out with him... well thats all i can say for right now soo....

      well on yahoo news just about 5 minutes ago they had an  urlLink artcle  about a constitutional amendment in mass. once again i will say that banning or refusing to recognize a gay marriages would be an act of discrimination. and not to sound racist or anything, im not trying to anyways take it as you wish, i think that if you talk to any elderly black person or someone that has heard their stories of when they had virtually no rights at all they will tell you that it was a very hard and painful time to be discriminated against because of their skin color. now imagine if you will if gays started to loose their rights one by one which has a good chance to happen if this amendment is passed, gay people will experience close to the same pain that african americans experienced but not to the same degree, because obviously gay people will face alot less pain than african americans did.  "Opponents rooted their arguments in the constitution's guarantee of every citizen's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, D-Boston, drew upon her experience as a black woman growing up in Arkansas, where the public hospital did not allow her mother to deliver her children.   "I know the pain of being less than equal and I cannot and will not impose that status on anyone else," a teary-eyed Wilkerson said. "I was but one generation removed from an existence in slavery. I could not in good conscience ever vote to send anyone to that place from which my family fled."      that above was an excerpt from the yahoo news article. i think it pretty much explains itself. people that are against gay marriages are also against the US constitution, the document our very nation was founded on, does it not say all people are equal and have equal rights in the law's eyes? because last i checked it did... also i believe the bible says that you shouldnt judge someone unless you are judged by that someone first, am i right? i know it was something to that effect. im also aware that marriages have been defined as a union between a man and women for about 3,000 years, but come on things change obviously, what would be so wrong about letting us get married? it wouldnt take any meaning away from heterosexual marriages, they would still mean the same thing, and if you dont like what we do, just stay out of our business then!

      lately it's been all over the news, should gay marriages be outlawed or accepted nationally. some say that marriage should be legally defined as a union between a man and a woman, i disaggree because if you want to and state that, that is like saying that homosexuals dont love one another like a man and a woman do. True, their sexual practices will be different but they still love each other just as straight people do. To outlaw or just allow civil unions between same sex couples would be unconstitutional, an act of discrimination. the way i see it is that the federal govt. shouldnt get into the lives of gay couples, they should allow them to get married and live happily ever after, because anything else would be discrimination, and under the constitution all people are equal in the law's eyes, so why not let them get married? the people out there that say all gay people should burn in hell and they will are just too shallow and uptight to see the greatness in a gay person. wheter it be against your religion or not, it is still wrong to hate gay people or feel any sense of resentment towards them. To make a law banning gay marriages would be an act of hate, and act of cruelty against gay, bi, and transgender people everywhere. if you havent heard of the matthew shepard story, maybe its time you should. matthew shepard was beaten and left to die tied to a fence post just because he was gay. it attracted national attention, and aided in the passing of several gay rights bills. taking the step of outlawing gay marriages will be a step backward, and wont save society, it would do more harm than good. HBO did a documentary type film  find it here  on his story if you havent seen it you should watch it, it could end up changing your life for the better. in the movie a priest said that he doesnt condone homosexuals but everytime someone calls them a fag, a lesbo, or a tranny it is an act of hate, and its time to put an end to it. if you dont aggree with what homosexuals do, then ignore it, besides its none of your business what we do in the bedroom.

      i went to see my grandpa today up in ann arbor, he is doing really well, it lightened my spirits to see that he was doing good first hand. he was being stubborn as always, he got tired of having a tube in his nose so he started to pull it out and pissed the nurse of but he didnt care, he just wants out of there. today he was still a little out of it, his voice is really low so its hard to hear him, he enjoyed the company of us... he is supposed to be out of the thoratic intesive care unit in a few days and into a regular room so then we can bring him cards and such, right now they are worried about germs so we had to suit up to go see him, thats the last thing he needs is a cold or some other illness, he is still a little bloated with water in one arm because thats where they have all of his iv's in at. today was the only day that no one stayed the night with him, only because everyone had work and couldnt take anymore off than what they already had. chris and paula are supposed to stay tomorrow night... well anyways now to talk about something else... one of the nurses there was SUPER cute he had a nice ass and a huge bulge i was like damn! and the good thing is that im going up there next weekend but i doubt i'll see him, he's supposed to be in a diff room i think... i heard that eric's mom got rid of the internet so that kind of sucks ill have to call him tomorrow and see how he's doing. keems might come over to djack on friday i think and hopefully eric comes with her so i can hang out w/ him or something... matt found out that i told jeanne and now he's pissed but really, i dont care i know why he does his shit that he does, he does it to get what he wants and to get attention, that is really immature i think, oh well at least i dont have to worry about him anymore... well i guess i better go, i should email karen about my grandpa so she can pass it on...

      well i finally heard it straight from my mom and dad, my grandpa is OK! in fact he is doing excellent especially for the type of surgery he had. he had an annurism in his aorta that was fused to his lung which is why he started to cough up blood a few months ago. he went to the university of michigan (an AWESOME health care facility)because no one around here would touch it. the doctor said that if he hadnt come into his office he would be dead right now. he endured a 10 hour surgery that began by shutting down his body and making the incision and actually using ice to cool down his body to help minimize the risk of paralysis, they had a 45minute time frame to complete that part of the operation and it only took him 38 minutes for his body to get cool enough to move on with the surgery. they had to remove the part of his lung that his aorta had fused to so his right lung is actually smaller now. my mom and all my aunts and uncles went up there sunday night with him to stay in a hotel since he had to be there at 530... he told everyone that he had a dream saturday night that all of his dead brothers and sisters came to him along with his mom and dad and told him that everything was going to be ok and that they would love to have him there with them but it just wasnt his time, his dad called him son for the first time... i know it sounds weird but maybe it was a vision, maybe it was real or maybe just a dream but no matter how stupid it sounds it made every one feel just a little bit better. monday night he wasnt breathing on his own which was expected, he couldnt move, talk, or open his eyes but he could hear people talk to him.. even though he probably wouldnt remember anything from that night everyone still talked to him, to help comfort him any way they could. my mom and dad ended up going back up to ann arbor today to go see him, he was breathing on his own and he was thrashing once he started it, it is a really good sign because most people after they have the surgery want to get up and move around and tend to kick which rules out the possibility that he was paralyzed during surgery, they had his hands and feet tied up so he wouldnt take out any of his iv's that they had him on, he opened his eyes a couple times today and when he started to try and get out of bed my mom and dad just talked to him and told him to relax and he would start to calm down. i feel so much better now, my nerves are shot though, i keep shaking like i always do when i learn something good or im about to tell someone a secret about myself... well i guess i will go, ill keep this updated as i hear more about my grandpa....

      today was a so/so day... in english it was boring as hell, we just sat there and listened to her talk about some stupid story we had to read in our lit books, so i guess it was ok that we didnt have any work although she did give us homework... in seminar all i did was do my math homework as usual then worked on some english work so it was kind of boring as always. Mr brosnan made us go into "silent" mode even though we didnt really pay any attention to him, after a while he just gave up on us because everyone was talking so it was of no use to yell at us.. in math i had a quiz that i couldnt use a calculator on one part of it anyway, it wasnt all that bad its just im really bad at mental math so it took me a while but i got it i think.. i hope i didnt fail that one too, i have to get at least a d- so i can get the credit for the class, im not worried about passing onto the next level of math since i wont be taking it next year, just science, history, english and seminar for me next year since im going to VOTEC, we do scheduling thursday in seminar so im going to be running around getting teacher signatures with friends so that'll be pretty cool. in art i forgot my project at home of course, im sooo stupid, so all i did was do english homework and finished up the last little bit of math that i had to do, i should be working on my art project now to make up for the time lost in class tooday, i should also get a start on my scetchbook instead of waiting until last minute this nine weeks. melissa let me borrow her AFI cd so she's wicked awesome! lol its a good cd really i think anyways... when i got home today i cried, i dont know what about i just felt like crying today for some reason, i was stressed out a bit but now im ok, im not really that depressed today so thats a good sign. i still havent seen my parents but it's kind of nice, no loud mom and no loud dad to bother me when i am trying to concentrate on something! so hopefully my mom gets off work tonight fairly late, she drives me nuts! well i guess since no one is really talking to me right now ill just get offline and read or something, i need to get caught up in my book i usually read about 4 chapters a day but i havent been reading in a long time so i should get back into it, its a great book, its a book about matthew shepard, i cant remember the name of it but its pretty good so far, really sad though. for the life of me i cant figure out why people hate gay people or think it is wrong to be homosexual, some say that it is a sin, and that all gay people will go to hell, well i dont really believe in all that nonsense about religion but i believe that if there really is a god and he is supposed to be all forgiving and doesn't judge anyone unless they judge him, why would i go to hell? why wouldnt he forgive me? well i guess i could go on and on about that subject but i think for right now ill just leave it for another post when i have nothing to post about... geeze i just realized how long this post is o well i guess if you read it all you like me lol! well i guess thats it for today unless something happens....

      hmmm well today went pretty good for me for the most part. i had a long talk with jeanne today about someone and i really cant say who, so ill just leave it at this: im no longer worried about someone b/c i know how they really are... well anyways i have good news, my mom called from ann arbor today to say that my grandpa's surgery went great, but they cant see him until seven so they will call once they get into see him. he had a large annurism (spell?) in his aorta he had to go up to the university of michigan becasue no one around here wanted to touch it but everything is gonna be ok now so im not all worried anymore... my parents should be back around midnight or so, so thats another night w/o them lol nothing much really happened today, i told alysia about my sexuality she was suprised but she's cool with it and all... im thinking about telling amber one day soon so that way i dont have to worry about it at all anymore.. that'll be nice! i have homework again of course, i have history, english, and french to do so im pretty much loaded down with it at the moment but im not too worried about it, ive been lazy as of late....  melissa showed me who she likes today, john comstock, he doesnt look all that bad, i think sonny looks better though, sonny has beautiful eyes, i should get a pic sometime and show you! well thats it for today i think....

      today for some reason was a really really hyper day for everyone at school, even me! in biology everyone was the usual yeah who cares type mood until mr brooks seen that mo had the goonies and he popped it in and that just like set the mood for the rest of the day, i was laughing my ass off and i couldnt stop for the rest of the day no matter how bad my head hurt i just kept on going. i would laugh at stupid things! omg im such a dork! in french we played baseball again and our team (the dandys) lol lost by 5 homeruns! we suck! lol next time she will take us outside to play it she says so thats going to rock! i tried to talk her into taking us out to play red rover "red rover red rover send (insert name here) right over!" i luv that game! its like wicked awesome! in computers i had the funnest time i've ever had! it was sooo funny! everyone was really hyper like u know the song i feel pretty o so pretty? well mo started singing it and a bunch of other ppl started singing it and mrs welke is like o god i know now to never let the inet be down when your class is in here! then me and courtizzle kept yelling back and forth at each other and doing that famous trademark lorraine noise it was just too fuckin funny! i kept using my "devil" voice and told mandy to stop staring into my soul and she said i had issues! lol YAY! i have issues! lol o i luv that class sometimes! at lunch melissa recorded the new sp video for me w/ her cam and i watched some of it! i was like jumping up and down and people were all staring at me but idc! lol then we got up in line and started talking about some weird stuff about how i was gay and stuff and people all around were just looking at us i was like umm lol it was funny though, because they know im different now right? and thats what i want! in history we had to make our own country and ours was a peaceful one that had a really complicated government that me and phil thought up its like a really big hierarchy but i think that it would be a very good government but thats just in theory, there would be alot more factors that we would have to include but all and all i say its a damn good government! omg i sooo dont want to go to texas! its going to be hell i have to spend a week straight with my parents without any breaks! its going to be hell! we're supposed to be giong to six flags there but that place sux i would much rather stay here and talk to chad or hell i would rather be with him than anything else right now! well you know i showed him my pic and he liked it! he is sooo awesome! *kisses chad* i luv you!! lol im all obsessive and stuff!

      today sucked big time, i have a horrible head cold and no matter what i take it wont ease up, all it does is make me tired! chad isnt doing very good read his blog. i told him that he shouldnt listen to whoever it was that said those things, all they are trying to do is get under his skin, all of what they said is a lie, chad isnt worthless chad means everything to me! he is a dream come true for me! whoever it was that called him and told him all that bs said that he was going to die alone, he wont die alone as long as im still around and i dont plan on going anywhere soon! so chad, as you read this i just want u 2 know that i love you and probably always will, you are a great guy so dont listen to those other jerks telling you otherwise! well i guess i might be able to start that alliance thing next year at school so i guess that's ok but w/e i have to go

      today wasnt a very good day... it all started when i woke up i could barely breath b/c my damn sinuses, they get worse everyday i need to hurry up and get my surgery done quick so i can say goodbye to all this allergy shit, its like having a constant year round head cold that wont go away no matter what you take! in biology i decided that i couldnt take it anymore and i snuck a few tylenol sinus and all they did was knock me on my ass and make me feel like i was going to pass out i was so tired, non drowsy my ass! in biology all we did was take notes then finished jurassic park, i figure this week will be an easy one since it is right before spring break, we shouldnt be starting anything new for a while yet.... in french we played "baseball" all it is, is a jeporady type thing but it was fun anyways, and i think we might playing the french card game where you have to reach 1000 miles before the other team, its a fun game if you know how to play it right, sometimes it does go a little to fast and easy but its all good. in computers we did in class notes which was very boring i turned on launch.com and listened to music while she was up there blabbering about some stupid shit...  at lunch nothing really happened, melissa liked my hair b/c it was soft and was all petting it, it was like a petting zoo or somehting lol it was kinda awkward but idc... in history all we did was our test and i got a c+ on it so that's pretty good, then we got this huge h/w assignment, i ended up w/ 4 pages front and back just for a damn section review! i hate that class! its like a damn sweat shop or something, he forces us to do shit all the time, it gets kinda boring! right now im talking to chad and courtney, god chad is such a sweetie! *kisses chad* courtney thinks im down in the dumps lately,  it kinda suprised me i was like huh? lol its just b/c that medicine today that just kinda slowed me down ALOT! lol well thats it for today!

      today seemed to drag on forever and ever! i couldnt sleep again last night even though i took some ambien before i went to bed, a couple hours before actually and i didnt really feel that much of an effect from them... o well w/e in english today all we did was read short stories and comment on them, i read mo's (mo pizzle) and it was a really good story, it used alot of details and it was pretty funny too! i read dan's also his was pretty good too, although it did lack detail, it was mostly just dialogue the ending kind of sucked to but all and all it was good, i also read derricks and his was alright it had a talking dog in it lol so it was cool. in seminar i had a good time, it reminded me of freshman year, nice warm weather and sitting in ms. b's class being bored out of my mind or just chillin w/ sonny (lol btw sonny=trevor in  my other posts) she had me fold the cheiftain expresses, it sucked! my thumbs have like sores on them now from folding all of them! and i didnt even get all of them done! i did about 300 of them so im in some pain now... o well it was ok she had me get her a pop and stick it in the freezer in the teacher's lounge, that place is weird looking, it all has these '70s couches in it and stuff and some nice lime green tables, yeah thats nice! shitty ass school i  go to! in math jolynn wasnt there so it wasnt as funny bud mrs. lee did wear the fake hair again! so that was some good comic relief that we much needed. i got all of my work done for once at home with out spending hours and hours on it like i usually do so that put me in a good mood, i have to get my hair cut tomorrow afterschool finally, its starting to go curly again and i hate curly hair on me! its ugly! if i let it grow long enough i bet i could look like ethan off of survivor lol that would be ugly on me! so im getting it hacked off, plus i have all of those dead end because it's been bleached twice since the last time it was cut so its in pretty bad shape, o well i should be able to put in some v05 and it should be ok.. in art i was talking about my mom and how much of a nasty ass bitch she was and mr vandenheede was right behind me and luckily he didnt write me up for it, thats all i need is a referral! o well thats it for today i guess.....

      today was actually a great day i was stressed earlier but as soon as i went outside for the first time afterschool today it like made me hyper and it made me wanna be outside all night long, hell if it wasnt so damn cold outside i would be sleeping in a tent, i luv tents when its warm out! i would sleep in one everynight if i could, they just rock, its a way of being outdoors and enjoying it. i remember one time when me and josh were out in the tent at his house a few years back and i woke up to the tent almost blowing away so i woke josh up and said we better get inside so he said o its not raining yet so we can stay till it does just then the top blew off and he said o fuck we better get out and put this in the garage and go inside so we got out and this was like 2 in the morning and we looked off towards cass, towards where i live, and we saw some wicked ass lightning and the winds were blowing at least 60mph steady i almost fell over a few times so we dragged the tent into the garage and his neighbor comes out and says you better get into the house a huge storm is coming so we said yeah we can tell so then we go inside and in about 10 minutes it starts pouring down rain so bad we had to put towels in the bottom of the outside doors because the rain kept bouncing right into them off the steps then it started to lightning and it was lighting up the whole house so we stayed up all night and didnt sleep to watch the storm it lasted at least 3 hours if i remember right. so that morning we call my mom to see if anything happened there and there was a down power line in the backyard so i was messing w/ her since it was hot i was like im sitting here in a cold ass house drinking slushies and i ended up staying there which was for three days until the power came back on.  speaking of camping josh's cousin said that we should all go w/ his other cousin matthew out west and actually go into the mountains with no luxuries and go hiking, matthew took courses on that kind of stuff so it would be awesome if we go someday, i love to go camping and that would actually be roughing it so im like pysched until we can do it  this summer is going to rock i cant wait we only have 9 weeks left of school after friday so that is only 45 days! im fucking happy as hell to know that school is almost out! I think that since sunday and sat are going to be really nice i might set up the tent and have a lil campout i luv camping! lol now if chad could come that would rock but that wont happen for a while at least i think so anyways...  tomorrow is supposed to be warmer than today was so that's even better i love hot weather though, once it gets into the high 90's and high humidity i'll be happy, i like to just sit out there and sweat for some reason it makes me feel, idk... good im odd like that but i luv the heat! well i guess thats it for now but im going to start a countdown for school we have 47 days left, counting tomorrow! since we have no shcool next friday!

      OMG good charlotte rocks! i love their cd it just got it out today and realized again how much they rock! on fuse saturday night they had celebrity tastemaker and good charlotte was on there OMG they are sooo hot! lol but chad is hotter i would say but they are really "not cool" as they put it they said that they are so not cool that they are cool, how ironic is that? they would be really fun to hang out with maybe i'll get lucky and win some sweepstakes or something so i can go on tour with them, now that would be a dream come true. today was actually an ok day, it was tiring because i had to ride the bus this morning but i got to sleep in biology since we are watching jurassic park b/c he forgot to fast foward to the dna part so he said o what the hell we'll just watch it all, so that was like kick ass! in french all we did was review since the test is on wednesday and friday, its going to be a tough one i think, i cant remember anything from this chapter, oops o well i'll do good probably..... o while you are reading this check out brian's blog hes pretty cool so just read it dammit or i'll kick you in your teeth at school because i know who most of you are! i think im going to sign up and talk to mr luthringer about that gay/bi/straight alliance thing, i think it would be a great thing to have, kids could come to it and we would promise not to tell who showed up if they didnt want us to, so that way kids would have a secure place to be themselves with other gay kids, and even straight kids could teach tolerance to the other straight kids in the school, it would show them how gay people are really no different than their sexual preferences, i hope that he would be willing to start something like that, start it out small only by word of mouth then spread it with posters and such after we get a good strong base of kids that are involved it would do the students and staff a lot of good for something like that... well thats it for now ...

      omg i have never seen so many lady bugs before in my life! i woke up on saturday (josh stayed the night on fri) and they were up in my windows b/c i had it open and they started to swarm me so i hid under the covers and went back to sleep lol, 10 is too early for me! when i got up tho i had to slip my clothes under the covers so i wouldnt get all fucked up by them. after me and josh got moving and had showers we went outside to see what my dad was up to and to clean out the shop vac since it was full of water and all kinds of nasty shit from the basement hotwater heater incident and we ended up tearing down the fort thing attached to the swing set which was really that hard it was pretty rotten so we could just push on it basically and it would fall apart then we piled it and burned it in the fire pit and used some kerosene to start it, it was a pretty damn hot fire! then around five we went and got some good ol' taco hell and went on over to his house and chilled watching mtv and fuse till about 230 in the morning, his mom and dad came home and asked why we were still up, josh said i was eating a salad lol it was funny for some reason so then we went downstairs and talked then went to bed and then in the morning his mom made some breakfast which was good because i felt like i had been hit with a train and it felt good to get some oj and real food in me. then i went home and i was here for about an hour and we took off to paw paw to go see my grandpa, he's still in a lot of pain and is really depressed about the whole thing but he's slowly getting better and better, he'll never be the same again though and that kind of makes me sad, he used to have a great time in the pool w/ all of us kids and stuff but now i doubt he'll even get into the pool this year but i guess it wont be all that bad there's always next year. when i got home i bleached my hair again and its really almost white now, it looks wicked awesome! i was thinking last night that i might go in and talk to mr luthringer about fitting in and stuff like that, i was thinking that yeah i have my group of friends and they are freaking awesome but i dont fee like i fit in very well at all just because im gay and all, so im going to see if he would like start a gay group or something up were gay kids can meet with others and talk after school or something it would rock! well thats it for now!

      Today was a pretty easy day for me, we had a 2 hour delay so that put me in a better mood since i got some more sleep that i needed amazingly! when i got to school me and josh went and hung out with ms. brooks for a while then i when i was headed to go get my bag from the cafeteria i passed by the offices and mr. luthringer called me in there and said well i need to talk to you about something you wrote i was like what did i write? he showed me the meap practice writting test on his desk and i was like ooo that.... he asked how i was doing w/ the depression and stuff like that i was like umm fine i dont really have anything thats bothering me right now and he went on to say that other kids feel the same way and stuff like that he kept telling me to come talk to him if i need to and to not do anything stupid it was weird. it totally caught me off guard! so anyways me and courtney have been talking and she likes me and all and doesnt understand how i can be gay, its just something you know i cant explain it, its just like being straight you just know and she doesnt think that i could be 100% sure about it either well i am completely sure that i am gay, i have had those doubts a LONG time ago and i know now that im gay and nothing will change it.... anyways... when i got home today i talked to chad as usual and i was supposed to call him today but my damn nerves got the best of me i went to dial his number and ended up hanging up half way through dialing i was just too nervous i hate it when im like that, ill give it another go tomorrow, i should just do it and be done with it because i know im going to like talking to him so i should just dial and enjoy myself and forget about being nervous and all that. well i guess thats all i can post for right now, lately i havent had much to say so ummm yeah

      this week has started out to be a bad one already... last night i got about 3 hours of sleep because i couldnt sleep at all even after i took some sleeping pills, this stuff is starting to get on my last nerve i wish that for one night i could sleep the whole night without waking up and then thinking about shit that i always forget by morning usually! its enough to drive someone insane. i finally got a wrist braces yesterday to help with the pain a bit, they seem to be working for the most part right now but i still have the pain in my elbows and thumbs pretty bad, damn im just falling apart all of a sudden.... my hard drive has FAILED yet again this would be the fourth to fail and the fifth that they will be sending me, this drive lasted around about 2 weeks before it died so im starting to get pissed so since i am stressed out i really let western digital have it this time, i said that they shouldnt be making these shitty drives that fail all the time and maybe they could lower their prices and stop loosing money but i guess they would rather use cheap shit and replace drives all the time... its really starting to piss me off.... my aunt and uncle were over yesterday because me my dad and my uncle chris  had to put in a new hot water heater that was about a bitch and a half! the valve to drain the hot water heater on the old one broke off so we had to run upstairs bucket after bucket to empty it then run back down grab the full one empty then then do it all over again about 20 times it got pretty tiring and annoying but it was good exercise that i really needed! i'm trying to loose some weight by cutting back on pop but its hard to cut back on caffiene im used to a 20oz mountain dew a day and a pepsi when i get home its hard to cut back but im going to try just the 20oz mountain dew for a few days and see how i feel, i should be able to do ok but im not sure yet. i talked to chad today and he said he almost came to the school today to come see me that would've rocked! i doubt the school would let me leave with him or anything like that but it would be awesome if they did someday.  i was just thinking that i probably dont have a chance with him because you know i dont have very high self esteem and im not all that good to look the least little bit... its depressing maybe because im a little depressed is why i keep thinking this but i think thats the way its going to be, ill never find anyone that's as good as chad is but the way i see it is that im just getting my hopes up on something that i know will never happen now... i cant get my mind off of him sometimes he is such a sweetie to me i keep thinking about how great it would be if we went out but i dont see that happening so im pretty much screwed....  im thinking that one of these days i wont be able to take it anymore and ill just give up like i always do and let things get the best of me, i only feel like that sometimes though so hopefully ill be happy again soon, yeah right, maybe its because im just really fucking tired today or something but i change moods alot and it gets really really old after a while, somedays ill be really down and others ill be hyper like when i first met eric, yeah that long ago, i thought that he was going to be great for me but i couldnt have been more wrong about that one... im glad i didnt get involved with him too much or i would be much worse off than i am now... well i guess thats all i have to complain about today so umm yeah... peace out....

      omg i love this cd! its wicked awesome (sorry melissa but i just had to steal your word!) my fav song is girls not grey its like the best song on the cd but the leaving song pt 2 is pretty damn good too, hell i like the whole cd! i havent been able to talk to chad for 2days now and im missing him really bad! i know im obsessive but hes like wicked awesome and he makes my day every time i talk to him which is close to everyday except on weekends. i want to call him really bad but my mom's phone card is really close to being empty and she wont renew it until monday so i would end up using up all the minutes and get into trouble w/ my mom and i hate it when she gets all mad b/c then she gets all loud so ill just tell her to shut up or something she annoys me badly! right now im getting extremely bored and a little lonely again im talking to kaitlyn and she is like really hyper because they (the band) got a 1 at districts so thats good! the band really kicks ass i shouldve stayed in it but i just didnt like mr comfort or the instrument i played it was too much of a hassle to bring back and forth to school all the time so i just gave up o well... thats what i do i give up on things alot i dont have the patience or devotion to anything like that. i was just talking to amanda fox and i cant stand her! she is all like im going partying w/ my lake friends or whatever im like yeah right you wish, well no not really more like i wish it would be fun to go to a part tonight instead of sitting at home doing nothing but complaining about how bored i am on this blog.... i really need to start writting about something worthwhile on here rather than stupid shit or blabbering, but i guess im just too used to making posts like that so w/e i dont care.... i was thinking about what i wanted to do after highschool today in history and i was thinking that by then me and chad wouldve met and we wouldve figured out whether or not we could go out and if we did go out and we were still together after i graduate i think i would move to st joe and get a job and probably attend wmu but im thinking about trying to get into the university of michigan, i love ann arbor its like feaking awesome its full of college kids so that makes things like even better! well i guess thats it for this post im in kind a of a neutral mood so i have nothing to say and people are starting to get online now....

      My back is killing me today along with my wrists its hell over here! I can barely walk up the stairs without having sharp pains in my upper back! I didn’t get to talk to chad today so that didn’t help things at all I want to call him really bad, I have his number and all its just my mom and dads phone card doesn’t have but like 20 minutes left on it so once I called him it wouldn’t do me much good b/c I couldn’t talk to him for very long…. Im thinking that even though chad is older than I am we would make a really good couple, every time I talk to him he makes me feel really good about myself no matter what kind of mood I’m in. he is really really really sweet too so that makes him like even better hes like a dream come true to me. I know these last couple posts have been nothing but chad this chad that but im sorry I like him and all I just feel like I always have something to say about him so I figure this is a good spot to talk about it since I talk about everything else on here. After all this blog is my life! OMG in math today we had a sub and a test so since mrs hargreaves wasn’t here today I couldn’t go in and ask her for help on some of the things the test was on so I was pretty much pissed off so I wrote on the front of my test we shouldn’t have had to take this this test today, you nazi. lol I know she is going to like that one! She really really hates me so I figure I might as well return the favor right? I finished my short story today in English I might post it on here but it’s a long one so if you want to read it just leave a comment and ill email it to you. In my English class we were given these plots, settings, and characters that 7th hour wrote randomly and I ended up with plot: two characters get lost in a cave then eventually find a way out after a while setting: a new york city high school in the 1980’s characters: an ogor and a horse… so umm yeah they didn’t really go together very well so I came up with a fairly good idea: two kids were smoking their bong one day after school they begin to trip then imagine that each other are an ogor and a horse inside a rainbow cave then they come back down and everything is back to normal… its actually a pretty good story its only 3 pages long though I wish i could squeeze a bit more length out of it though…. I got windows server 2k3 today and im lovin it! Its much faster than xp will ever be and it is much more stable and secure, linux I think finally has something to compete against. This is the best Microsoft operating system that I have used yet, so far no crashes or anything, although the shut down screen is quite annoying you have to provide a reason for the shutdown how stupid is that? I mean come on why would I have to provide a reason! Im looking for a crack to get rid of the activation because once I activate I have 120 days to try it then im done so I think if I can get past the activation I could use it for the rest of my life! And then i think it will be legal as far as Microsoft will ever know! Those dumb fucks! Well I don’t know but im in a good mood right now, I have been lately too this week started like shit but then got better and better partly because of chad I bet but still it got better and better, im finally caught up in my homework so I don’t have that hanging over my head anymore, its like a huge weight has been lifted off of my chest…  the carpet cleaners were here today now the house has an overpowering soap smell i hate it! me and my mom just got done putting everything back into the living room and she was all yelling at me b/c i didnt have the couch in the right spot so i said fuck off i dont care you do it... lol im such an ass but she pissed me off so i let her know it! well I just realized how long this post was so I guess ill stop blabbering like I always do since survivor is on and all well that’s it for now ppls….

      the week so far has been a living hell besides monday, its been dragging on forever but now im beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, i found out today that the only class im behind in from monday's trip is biology which wont take me long at all to get all caught back up. i picked a good day not to be at school! windows 2k3 still hasnt come and i still have a shitload of homework but right now im looking at 2 sketchbook drawings, 2 biology worksheets, and to write my short story i should get the art done then work on my short story and get that out of the way and do my bio in seminar tomorrow if i find the time...i was talking to mandy in computers today on aol, i guess she was home sick it was kinda funny to be talking to her from computers class when she sits like right across from me. people still keep complimenting on my bag i think more people are going to do it if you give them some time i know they will... i  really never have anything to say anymore ive been pretty much busy with school lately and all... im talking to chad right now, he's wicked awesome i think we'll meet up soon if im lucky. kaitlyn talked to him and he said that looks dont matter to him so thats like a dream come true, i hope he wasnt just saying that to make her happy or anything because i really really wanna go out with him sometime if its at all possible. tomorrow i have to do my presentation in english class damn i hate going up in front of a lot of people, its just not my thing we have to do this thing about some dumbass poems in our lit. books that really dont make any sense, let alone flow. so i dont think that is going to go very well, i think all i am doing is a power point presentation i still have to make it up tonight if thats what im going to do... she didnt give us enough time we just got the damn assignment yesterday and we all have to do it tomorrow! thats just bullshit i think but o well she just cant expect anything too great from anyone, if she wants good stuff then she should give us more time to do it. tomorrow is my math test and i can garuntee that i will fail it! i suck at what we are doing right now its like totally confusing and if you make one little tiny mistake you fuck up the whole problem and then you are pretty much screwed because chances are you wont find the mistake and you cant ask the teacher for help, not like she would anyways, so its pretty much a lose/lose situation no matter how you look at it. i need to go in there during seminar and ask her how to do that thing on the calculator again so that way ill be prepared just a little more than usual for the test. i think i might have lost a little weight i hope i have becuase i need to loose some more not much more but i would say 5 pounds and that would be awesome! i should work out more, i need to get a lil muscle for when i meet with chad i dont wanna look like a lil tiny twig, even though i am i just dont wanna look too bad, i hope courtney still has that hotel party thing that would rock to have that. i dont know how long it would last though probably just over night or something.... i really dont feel like doing anything tonight as far as homework goes i think i might work on my story since i love to write but i dont think it is going to be a good story or anything amazing, i suck at art! i have to draw a choice thingy then draw a hood ornament which i think im just going to do the pontiac one since it's just like an arrow type thing with just a tad bit of chrome so it'll be a piece of cake.... im going to change seminars tomorrow i think mr brosnan is an ass and ms brooks wrote a letter for me so i can change w/o having to talk to mr dockherty about it... well i guess thats it for this post my wrists are killing me i really need to have them checked out!

      OMG today was like the worst day ever! i am in homework way past my head, i have 5 scetchbook drawings left, a shit load of math and biology to do not to mention i still have to write my short story i think im going to go insane with all this homework! in seminar i asked mrs hargreaves to show me the homework that i dont do and slammed my folder down on the desk and she said no, i dont feel the need to show you.. i said you are sooo stupid and turned around and walked out. then of course i have her 7th hour so i had to sit in there right after seminar while she glared at me, o well she ended up leaving about half way through the hour... i think my mom will cuss her out once she gets a hold of her. that will be sooo funny if she does that! my hard drive hasnt come yet, neither has windows 2k3 but i think my hard drive will come later hopefully b/c i need to get this other one sent out before the label expires on it. omg i am soooo fucking stressed its not funny today i felt like crying in math and its just going to get worse i know it is but i guess ill have to learn to deal with it dammit i cant believe i have all of this shit to do by friday! right now i just need to get away from it all and relax for a while without all of that damn homework hanging over my head its driving me insane but i dont wanna leave because chad is on and i dont wanna leave him unless i gotta.... mrs frantz had a st joe yearbook from his freshman year and he was sooo cute in that pic! i cant wait to meet him! well i dont really have much to say today im just totally stressed and i feel like crying it really really really sucks!

      Today was science olympiad at it was pretty fun! i didnt place in any of my events (above 8th that is) i got one point for disease detectives and 3 for dynamic planet. it was a really fun time, we had these radios and there was this short lil kid on them from three rivers that i kept messing with, he kept calling me a gay fag or whatever i was like yeah i know, thanks for noticing, i must be doing something right today! that was too funny then he just kept calling me that even though he knew i didnt give a shit what he said, the kid was like 14 and shorter than melissa! that is soooo short! i talked to chad in student commons a few times it was fun melissa talked to him for a while too so thats cool.  i didnt get windows 2k3 yet today so that means probably tomorrow along with my new hard drive if ups is running on time itll be here around 930 thats pretty early for ups! the middle school got 3rd place overall and they ended up gonig to state so thats wicked awesome im going to have to go see mrs steil and talk to her about it and congratulate her and see whats been new with her.... i covered my back pack with duct tape on sunday so now it looks like a big piece of duct tape, it is like sooo awesome ppl asked me y i did it i just said because it needed some real style! i think it doesnt really look all that bad but i guess its all in personal opinion. i stayed at josh's last night and couldnt sleep so im really fucking exhasted well i better go, that homework isnt doing itself

      ive gotten so far behind in school now its not funny, that field trip totally fucked me up! I am behind in math and art, since science olympiad is monday ill be behind even further, i think i might have to stay after everyday next week and use seminar time just to catch back up, this is why i hate field trips sometimes, sure they are fun while you are gone away on them but then as soon as you get back to school its like reality sets in and you realize that you are up to your eyeballs in homework so then you become stressed and then things just are downhill from there.... i probably wont sleep tonight, i drank a pot and a half of coffee around 8ish i was thirsty and felt like getting that little extra boost of coffee, not to mention coffee tastes awesome! i talked to chad again today in computers he is sooo freaking sweet, he says he really likes me but i know for a fact that once i show him a pic of me he wont anymore, thats the way it was with eric, i hope he doesnt get all weirded out or anything once i show him but hey i guess its all good.... he told me that if we went out on a date that HE was paying and that was that lol i wouldnt make him pay all of it , i would at least put in a little money because if i didnt i would feel bad. i think that maybe ill have a chance with him but i doubt it, most guys see my pic and run the other way i just hope he wont im not saying that he will but i still have that doubt in my mind that ill never find anyone... anyways chad is like a dream come true, he is such a sweetie everytime i talk to him he changes my whole day around, he always makes me smile and feel wanted in this world which is a really good thing because sometimes i feel that im not, well ok im not but still! anywho martha stewart got found guilty of all charges today so that was kind of amusing she deserves what she got though she shouldve known better but i guess money makes us all crazy somehow or another.  overall i would have to say that this week has dragged itself on by and in many ways it was a horrible week in others it was a great one! it was bad because i felt that i forgot just about everything that was important to remember for school but then it got better because i was talking to chad just about everyday this week, he always makes things better!  i was just thinking about how much this blog has changed since i came out, before i never posted at all and now i try my best to post everyday, this has helped me alot i think, it lets me get my thoughts out and it helps me think sometimes about my life.... next time i cant sleep i think ill get on and post what i have running through my head, it seems to happen to me more and more, i cant sleep because too much is on my mind and i just cant "concentrate" on getting a good nights sleep... last night i woke up a 4 and couldnt got back to sleep so i just layed there thinking about things so i was tired as fuck in first hour while mr brooks talked about DNA and RNA shit, in french we had that test hat i think i did ok on, the spoken part sucked though, i didnt understand what she said, she mumbled it so i lost a few points but that ok im doing good i think in that class anyways... in math i failed my quiz, it was over solving linear systems with substition and linear combination methods and we are supposed to go back and check the variables to see if we did it right and i couldnt get any of them to check right so i went through one of them and re did it four times and still the same thing, i went through the others twice and still had the same damn thing going on, i couldnt get the damn things to check so that was yet another f in the grade books for me! yay! *jumps* yeah right... well thats it for now... leave a comment dammit and chad if u read this post a comment!

      yay! i finally got my computer back up and running until i get my other drive then all i have to do is ghost this one and send the piece of shit back to them! lol dumbass people at western digital, this would be the 3rd drive to fail and the 4th they have sent me! i cant believe this on is failing! its not even a week old straight from the factory! o well i guess ill have another one pretty damn quick here! today went pretty good the field trip was today and it was pretty cool, we had a survivor pirate type thing so it was kind of amusing... we got to beat each other up with those water noodle things that was fun! omg lol i kept hitting courtney and alcia with them and they were all like stop and hit me back lol i love to annoy people sometimes! i really needed this field trip i needed a bit of a break off school its been really stressing me lately and i know it is going to get worse because i wont be there monday or next thursday (all sophomores are going to career day) monday is science olympiad so that's gonna be another nice break for me... i stayed after school again until four like i usually do for science practice, i made up a quiz for mrs. hargreaves and i failed it, apparently we now have to know who thought up all these theorems and such, so now its kind of like history class! i sooo dont understand the homework so now i will be behind by 2 lessons and will have to go see her tuesday in seminar or afterschool someday so i can catch up and go over the stuff with her, i know she will say something to piss me off too, she always finds a way to do that! i hate her soooo much! omg today at the middle school the offices caught on fire somehow, we seen the fire department there after the field trip when we went by... i bet mrs wickett started it! lol she was a bitch too she didnt like me i dont think but then again not very many people do! oo i showed courtney a pic of chad today at the table she screamed DAMN lol i was cracking up i was yeah he is pretty hot! lol it was 2 funny everyone was all looking at us in the cafeteria.... someday we might meet up i think and hang out a bit, hell maybe we could go out someday! that would be great right there... well i guess i better go i have homework yet....

      Well everyone i actually met someone thats worthwhile and actually live around here! he is wicked awesome! hes from st. joe, hes in a band and hes soooo sweet lol im all obsessive sounding but thats alright maybe someday we could hook up or something! well today i called western digital because it sounds like my drive burned out another bearing and ive only had the damn thing just a lil over a day so they told me that my new one would be here in 3-5 business days and i wont have to pay to ship the old one back since they are sending me a ups sticker thats prepaid so i just have to drop it off at a ups place thingy. today was actually a really good day for me! in biology me and michelle just talked and did our DNA models that was pretty fun she lives in town now so maybe should walk up w/ all of us sometime. in french we played jeporady and our team ended up coming back from -1000 points to 450 i think so we sucked! lol but it's all good we had a good laugh, freshmen somtimes can be mature and laugh at the right time and it so turns out that they did today in french. in computers i was like swamped but i manged some time to talk to chad and im glad i did he pretty much made my day, hes so freaking awesome! in history we took some notes and discussed a quiz that we took, it was quite boring and i had chad on my mind lol well i guess thats it for today my back is killing me and my fingers are kind of stiff so ummm yeah.....

      today was a half day for teacher conferences, i think my mom is going to go see mrs hargreaves-lee about the shit she's been putting on my report card, she keeps saying that i dont do my homework! yeah right, i only spend about 4 hours everynight on it! i have ALL of it in my binder that she makes us keep, i dont get her she checks to see if i have it there which i always do then she says that i dont do my homework? i just must be staring at my math book for 4 hours everynight, yeah that's me i tend to "stare" at my books for hours on end! what a bitch, she is always just like glaring at me and then laughs when i ask her a question i never do anything to make her mad though it gets quite annoying one of these days i should cuss her out, im sure i will someday.... when i got home my hard drive was here but i dont have a working copy of xp so i have to wait until i can get one from josh, the drive is horribly loud it like cuts through your ears, its quite annoying also... im hoping to have my computer up and running by the end of the week the way it was before my hard drve decided to burn itself up.... im like super tired i couldnt sleep yet again and i took some of my mom's sleeping pills (ambien i think) and they did nothing for me, they usually do though, i think its because ive had a lot on my mind lately. then i had to get up at 515 to catch the bus, take a shower, and eat some food b/c i hadnt ate since yesterday lunch time, i was freaking starving! hopefully tomorrow will be a good day, i have history though i hate that class, mr stanger thinks that we are an "advanced" class so we should be able to handle anything he throws at us.. we have been having a test every week in there its going to make me snap one of these days i cant handle all that studying plus 4 hours of math everynight, im not that smart of a person. hell thats too much stress on me, i have enough shit to deal with let alone school work everynight, 4 hours! its insane but next year should be much better ill be spending half of my school day at votec to get CISCO certified so that means half of the classes at the highschool which means no math YAY! i think i might take it senior year though, i just need a year off of it for the moment its becoming too much i dont think i could handle trig that sounds really hard, but then i thought i couldnt handle adv. algebra but i am with a c+ at it too! I cant figure out for the life of me how to back this bitch up the blogger instructions are very vauge and dammit im not that smart to figure it out! ill just make josh do it or something, he can figure it out im sure... ETS field trip to the college is thursday so im going to be behind in math and all so thats not good, its hard to get caught up in math class! but it should be fun, courtney is going and she's fun 2 be around so it should be wicked awesome! then science olympiad is monday so that'll be a blast, all i have to do is go to my 2 events then hang out with people and maybe bring joe's laptop or w/e and use that to play some unreal tournament i love that game! well i guess thats all i have to say for now so ummm Salut! (goodbye in french i think)

      today is going to be really boring today in computers because all we are doing is notes and webpages, fun fun... the weather sucks because it is rainy but its warm so i guess its not all that bad. yesterday i was in a good mood because i was at josh's house and i had something to do besides sit around and think about how lonely i am but yeah i think things will get better soon i hope. i need to call eric and see whats going on because i guess matt wants to kill himself now because somehow he lost his friendship with him so i need to see whats going on and then i need to call matt and have a talk with him, maybe even give jeanne a call and tell her about it too. so really its just more shit i gotta deal with. my hard drive will be here tomorrow so ill be posting more meaningful posts and maybe even longer ones too. im sorry about the other day's post it is really a horrible post, not because the topic, because of i was skipping around alot and it really didnt make much sense. i think im going to back my blog up i dont think i could handle losing all these posts.... well i guess i better go

      today was like... wow! chad is such an awesome guy. i was sooo nervous like when he called at the junior high to say he was like 5 miles away then when he called again so we could find him i was sooo nerous i kept looking for a red honda then when we finally got him to where we were and i saw it i was like omg this is going to ROCK! the first thing that i wanted to do when he got out of his car was give him a huge hug and say i love you chad but since there was people and this town is small i couldnt but believe me chad thats the only thing i wanted to do i love you ALOT! i hope that you aren't mad or anything that i didnt hold your hand but then the whole small town thing came up so next week maybe even tomorrow im going to tell my mom and dad about me and then the first thing im going to do when i next see chad is give him a really big hug and take his hand in mine no matter who is around, the word has to get out so im thinking that would be a great way of doing it. wow chad smelled really good too! i was like damn you smell good i think he was wearing axe or something idk all i know is that he looked good was really sweet and smelled good. i really think that this was the best day of my life and im sure that things are just going to get better. danette suprised me today, she got into a small argument with me before chad came and seemed a little idk unpleased that i had him coming in and the whole gay thing got brought up again but she does have good intentions she gave chad a hug i was like omg that is soooo nice im so glad she didnt have any hostility like i kinda guessed she would, so i guess she isnt all that bad sometimes she is really really cool like today! we just kinda walked around djack and chilled most of the time then when we were uptown melissa got up ahead of me and started talking to chad so i just let her go a head because i knew she didnt want everyone hearing so i kinda fell back a bit then she came back to me and told me what happened. she said that she asked him if we were official yet and he said no, which we weren't, he was waiting for me to ask him so i walk up and courtney and melissa fall back and i say so... melissa told me what happened and i said so, you wanna? he said yes i was like awesome! lol its sooo great! then we just walked around some more and i put my arm around him and he put his around me (shoulders) but we couldnt do it for very long b/c well yeah all that small town stuff came up again so yeah... i wouldve loved to just walk around like that for the rest for the night it felt like awesome im lost for words i cant even explain it... it was like a dream come true wow! well after that we walked around all over djack then we ended up at the park in front of pat ham and everyone kinda gathered there then we (me and chad) took off to walk around the highschool it was pretty cool to have some alone time if there wasnt anybody at the school i wouldve gave him a huge hug and held his hand that is definately going to happen next time with out a doubt. i feel really bad for not just doing it i shouldve just done it but i guess im too much of chicken its not that i dont want to but i cant, its like a whole huge complicated mess, but im hoping to have it all sorted out by time next time rolls around well actually i WILL have everything sorted out because i dont want to have to hide a wonderful thing if i dont have to. when we got back around kelsey and some dude and matt joined us at the statue place and it got quite loud but it was fun after that we decided to go get his car and drive out and see jeanne so we did and she liked him im sure, he was awesome i almost brought him into my house and told my mom that way but he didnt wanna get into it and i understand that so im not mad or anything i wouldve done the same thing if i was in the situation i dont him to be really uncomfortable or anything so im just going to tell them someday when my bros and sis arent around and i think it'll go ok i suppose its going to be scary but its going to be ok i think then chad can come over and we wont have to hide anything anymore and that will be even more awesome than things are now... im still in like a daze from it all its amazing today was the best day of my life i cant believe how great it was, it was more than anything i couldve hoped it to be it was just WOW it was THAT awesome. i really miss him now i wish i was with him somewhere in kzoo or something it wouldve rocked if i coudlve stayed like all night but that wouldnt have worked. ok well ill shut up now but hey theres probably more that i left out so ummm yeah... I LOVE YOU CHAD!

      Right now im in seminar typing up a blog post in word so if there is anything out of the usual about capitalization and stuff its not my fault its word¡¦s *shoots word*. I read chads blog and I was hoping to catch him on bolt before he got offline but I was too late since its only about a quarter after nine right now and he posted at 9 I was hoping to catch him but I didn¡¦t so ƒ¼. I did call him though I left a voice mail message I guess he didn¡¦t get it but its alright ill call him tomorrow since I have driver¡¦s ed from 5 to 9 tonight so that pretty much robs me of all the time that I had planned to do homework and stuff from me. I think that Friday would be a good day for chad to come to djack since I don¡¦t have drivers ed and my mom already said that I could go uptown so I¡¦m just going to do that. I have to call and make my hair dye appointment for Friday after school I guess that I am just getting the tips of my hair blue instead of highlights or the whole thing blue. Its going to look wicked awesome in melissa¡¦s words lol. We were talking on the phone last night and she¡¦s all like men have wieners and girls have cookies lol that was so funny I was lmao, I think eric wants to talk to chad sometime but im pretty sure that chad wouldn¡¦t like eric because eric well yeah its eric idk if chad would like him or not really. I couldn¡¦t stop laughing in drivers ed last night it was too funny we were watching this movie so curtis, chris, josh, and I were making fun of it like this girl was backing out of a parking space and this guy come flying up behind her b/c he wasn¡¦t paying attention so I was like yeah she gets out and slaps him silly and calls him a nasty whore lol it was just too funny im surprised that we didn¡¦t get in trouble I was dying! I really wish I could¡¦ve gotten a hold of chad last night but I guess I couldn¡¦t so I will tomorrow and see if Friday is a good day for him to come to djack ill buy him gas if he needs it to come to djack I have no problem with it just as long as I get to see my sweetie lol he is sooo awesome lol. I better go ms b is watching me I think probably reading this right now lol

      i hate sundays sooo much! i always end up waking up late and then i have like nothing to do the whole day and it feels like the day is just a complete waste of time, i would love to do something on a sunday but they are just sooo boring its like there's nothing to do and tomorrow you know you are going to dread because you have school and mondays are always extremely boring! our schedules are fucked up the whole week, the juniors have meap testing, like we have a 20min 3rd hour on tuesday and a 2.5 hour seminar which will be really boring if kaitlyn doesnt come into my seminar to work on her powerpoint presentation. last time she came in there all we did was talk and since ms. b likes me she didnt say anything, i doubt she even noticed it. dammit i was really excited about going to see chad this weekend but of course my sister had to be an ass and not take me, she came over today i was like cmon mckenzie ya know you wanna take me there b/c u know you love me but she wouldnt fall for it so damn her... my mom bought a new fridge today and spent buku bucks on it, it was like a 1800 dollar fridge for 900 so i guess it's a good deal but damn that bitch better wipe my ass for me or something to pay for itself damn that alot for a damn thing that keeps food cold. its insane i tell you! kinda like me so i guess ill get along w/ it lol im so stupid! yay! stupid ppl rock! im not looking forward to school at all tomorrow, i guess i am in a way so i can see all of my friends again but still its going to be boring in french i have to present something and no one is in there that i really talk 2 besides amber and i dont think shes gonna b there so idk.... well i think thats all i have to talk about so l8r...

      i was REALLY REALLY looking forward to meeting chad this weekend but of course my sister wont take me to kzoo since she is already in djack and doesnt plan on going back to kzoo until monday so it sux assholes! i was really excited about it and all, i was going to finally meet the one person that means the world to me! rrggg my sis makes me mad sometimes i guess there's always another time i hope. i talked to chad for a while last night and it was a pretty good time he was playing around on the drums he was pretty good sounding from what i heard over the phone i would love to hear his band play something sometime. i wase talking to him about how melissa always steals my ring and all i said ya know if you want it you can have it, i would have no problem giving it to chad i love him sooo much! *kisses* if we are going out next year around prom, im pretty sure we will be, im going to take him, it would be a dream come true if i can take him, it would blow people's mind but i love him ALOT so i'll take him ne ways! :p my mom was being a bitch today so i told her to lay off and go take some midol or something, i think she ran out of celexa's or welbutrin's because she usually doesnt get this pissy when she's on the wrag so maybe she did, if she did she needs to hurry up and get her ass some more before i come unglued! rrggg she pisses me off sometimes like its sooo bad sometimes she just doesnt shut up, she'll keep going forever and ever about something stupid then get mad at me when i tell her to be quiet. o well ill just retreat to the basement (the dungeon) and listen to some music and everything will be alright! music is a great thing it helps me to figure things out when im down or it'll make me hyper, either one of the two are good in my book. i spent the night at josh's last night because i needed to get out of the house for a while and since i wasnt going to kzoo i was like sure ill go, we just chilled most of the time, we got in a good 3 hours of fuse today we had that shit crankin' it was good to hear good music and hear it really loud its like heaven! i think i finally converted josh into liking simple plan, i caught him singing it today when we were measuring some stuff and i was like hmmm wahts that josh? i and i was ooo someone finally likes simple plan! lol it was funny, im hoping to get to talk to chad tomorrow, i'll probably end up calling him or something, o man i love him! *kisses again* you rock chad!

      i just finished my test in here finally it was really really easy we even got to use our html books which made it super simple... im really really hoping that i can get my sis to take me back 2 kzoo with her so i can meet chad and party she would probably do it for me so i think i will call her tonight and see what's going on and all... in english today we were acting out julius caesar, the stabbing part, and it was fucking hillarious like everyone that was up  there didnt really act all that well and when kim said o caesar it sounded like she was trying to seduce kristen lol it was just too funny.... i read chads blog a just a lil bit ago and it was really really sweet he is such a sweetheart he is an awesome guy no matter what happens ill always think that! *kisses* i love you babe! i cant wait until tonight he is supposed to call me i think or im supposed to call him im not so sure so umm yeah ill get to talk to him either way which makes me really really happy! *hugs chad* im always really happy when im talking to him like i cant stop smiling when i talk to him either online or on the phone and when i read his blog i smiled even more for like the whole rest of the hour and i probably wont stop for a long time to come yet. well that's it for right now ill post more like later 2 night....

      today i was thinking about how close the end of the school year is, we only have one more test in math, 2 more labs in computers then its just building our webpages from there, and we are just going to finish julius caeser in english and read a short novel then we are done for the year in there which makes me really happy. so really from now on its pretty much easy shit from now on in all my classes... i finally got to talk to chad today which is like wicked awesome and i read his blog post for today and honestly it brought me to tears, he is going through a lot right now and i wish i could be there to help him out but im not so its like a really really bad feeling knowing that someone you love is hurting and there isnt much you can do about it :( *cries* i keep telling him things will get better once he figures things out which they will he just has to figure something out and once he does i really hope he will feel a lot better, im hoping to be able to get to kzoo this weekend and meet him up there, if i have a talk with my sis i think that she would take me under the circumstances since she lives up there anyway i think she will come down tomorrow night and probably leave sat. night so i could hitch a ride then and probably stay with her at her place over night and then come back home, hmmm *thinks* maybe chad could stay for a lil "sleepover" late late sat night lol hmmm im evil! my mom cant find the hair dye that i want so she is going to sally's this weekend to see if they have it there, they should but idk... in drivers ed i couldnt stop laughing today, first it was the teach's stupid voice he does then the movie we watched just sent me over the edge like this guy had a bright ass red suit on that like flickered on the tv then he got into a red car w/ red interior, omg it was nausiating! (sp?)  i was like woah damn someone likes red! it wasnt a deep red either it was like a candy red, horrible i tell you! im glad to have drivers ed done for this week and im thinking that its just a waste of time now because i cant really say that ive learned much except how to parallel park, that is like drilled into my skull i dont think i'll ever forget HOW to do it its just a matter of DOING it which im not good at all lol o well i just need practice and well i better go i have to do some shizat lol that word is odd....

      ok i have some stupid ass goals that are pretty much random that i just felt like writting down in history today...  1) meet chad obviously 2) run through downtown eau claire screaming something completely random 3) get a plain white tshirt wardrobe and write shit ALL over them and maybe even put a few duct tape racing stripes on them KIK ASS lol think evil remember? 4) take melissa to the mall someday and go have some fun in hot topic and mess w/ ppls walking by... 5) ride a bike off a boat into a lake and/or ride one down my basement stairs 6) i have to break a bone this year its just something I HAVE TO DO! lol but it has to be something crazy that makes me do it 7) go from a bunch of cool random hair colors (blue is at the top of course) 8) go to nyc baby! well thats fall but hey its close to summer 9) enjoy my time with no brothers! YAY! lol 10) go see simple plan and good charlotte definately! 11) go linedancing idk y but that just seems like it would be fun to do if i had a really really strong caffiene high (cornerstone here i come!) even the music sux u gotta love it lol 12) just walk through djack w/ josh and try and find something to do and see how long we can walk around before we get in trouble 13) walk back and forth from town to my house (about 10 miles) at least 20 times w/ josh so i can get some good exercise  wow ok those are really stupid but i just had to do it idk y i thought of most of them but hey its going to rock this summer i think i wont have to worry about having 2 deal w/ ne one around the house for at least the first 6 hours of my days and that just sounds very very inviting! well hmmmm ok im in a good mood because chad sent me an email today which im about to reply to and it made me cry he feels like he let me down, he didnt let me down he just lost his job thats all, a job doesnt matter to me when im thinking of a guy like chad, he has a great personality and thats all he needs in my book! wow ok i have a math test tomorrow and i have no clue whats going on b/c i dont understand it and i got a d+ on my history test! omg im like sooo bad in that class i studied for ever *shoots mr stanger* dammit o well... im getting hair dye tomorrow or friday i hope! its going to be wicked awesome! well i better go b/c i need to think of something random to do to get rid of some of this hyperness in me!

      wow, ok today was a really long day! in english i slept because i didnt know what to do and then in seminar i worked on math homework then in math we corrected stuff and asked questions and somehow we wiggled out of the 103 question review and we dont have to turn in our folders until tuesday which means i can still catch up on it all...  then in art all we did was watercolors and i ended up just sitting there and talked like i usually do and i didnt get anything done, i never do in that class i bet i end up getting a c or something in there but i dont care i just wanna get it all over with for once and not have to worry about it all.. that reminds me, i have to start on my sketchbook this week if i ever get enough time to squeze it in but i doubt i will. at drivers ed i talked to chris a little bit and he is pretty cool, im going to have him email me, dont worry chad he's not the type i would ever date believe me!  then we watched a movie and it was really really stupid like this lady looked like she was a vampire and i was like WOW! what the fuck is up with that? then i started laughing my ass off when the guy came on and he looked like he had a wig on lol bc it was all bouncing and shit. ok then... after driver's ed we were waiting for my mom and lindsay and lindsay from djack and chirs and curtis were all there and she's like he closed his eyes and talked 168 times! i was like omg thats insane lol we were all making fun of him (sherman the teach) it was 2 funny lol im pretty much exhausted b/c my mom wasnt done working yet so she took us back to the shop for like 2 hours so me and josh went out walking and ended up running most of the way then we got some md's and now i feel all fat lol so i guess thats it for now.... I LOVE YOU CHAD!

      today went ok until i read my email in 5th hour (computers) today. i was happy and about to cry at the same time. first i was happy that i finally heard something back from chad but what i heard wasn't very good.... he lost his job and is in a really shitty mood he was scared to tell me about it but i want him to know that he doesnt ever have to be scared to tell me ANYTHING im here to listen and help the best i can so if you read this chad, dont ever be afraid to tell me something no matter how bad it is, just tell me and i can help you out with it all, dont call yourself a loser or feel like one, because you're not by any means, you are my babe and you always will be. it was just a job i know its going to be extremely hard to get by but just tough it out, you'll find a job you just gotta work really hard at it no matter how shitty you feel, and if you get turned down by a job then just move on, dont quit looking until you found one. i found that one out the hard way, i was looking for love, gave up and felt shitty, then i found you and now i feel great about myself. so dont ever give up no matter how hard it may seem ok? i love you baby *kisses* never forget that!... in drivers ed all we did was listen to sherman talk and talk and talk some more... chris was laughing his ass off for some reason today maybe b/c i was making fun of most of the stuff sherman said i was being stupid really, it wasnt all that funny but hey i had a good time so maybe tomorrow wont be so bad... i got some more of my math homework done tonight but i only got a worksheet done so there's tons more left but im almost out of the woods for this chapter *screams* and once the test is done ill feel like a new man!

      this weekend was pretty great actually, it was a VERY nice break from it all for a change, hell i was even kind of in a semi-happy mood doing math. i needed to just sit around and not be running everywhere and doing everything, it was great.... friday night we went and seen the sunset over lake michigan in drivers ed, it was the most beautiful thing ive ever seen! i was almost in tears i was so stressed out it was like the greatest thing to see that, it made me think that my life will get better i just have to give it time, ill find someone if chad isnt the one, ill oneday be able to watch the sunset on the beach of lake michigan with that special someone, i think that once i do that with that person that it'll be the greatest day of my life, it will mean so much to me no one will even begin to understand... saturday jeanne was around so we just hung out and did shit around the neighbnorhood me and her talked about things, about how im going to tell my mom and dad about me being gay.. its going to be great once i tell them, no more hiding everything anymore it will be awesome i hope... then i went to joshs house and we fucked around with xandros and then sunday we woke up and blasted fuse and sat on the deck, we had that damn house pumping we had like all the windows open and the stereo just about maxed out, its a fisher but damn that bitch rox! alot more than my jvc will ever, i blew the subs on my jvc so now it sounds like shit but o well... then my sister came over and we just hung out over at my house and talked and shit like that it was kinda fun, me and her are going to new york city in the fall i hope she said that i should save up some money for the plane tickets and then we're set so i cant wait.... well now that i look ahead into the next week im hoping that it wont be too bad, i have several good aspects to look forward to, maybe i can talk to chad finally and then i will feel much better but theres still the math h/w to do and french and art so that ups my stress level about 50 points now but ill manage...

      this week has sucked big time and im still not out of the woods with it all yet, its making my go insane with how much shit i gotta do, i got my french project today and its going to take me forever to do that, we have to have all kinds of shit, way too much for me to handle.... i sent chad an email hopefully he'll reply i think hes avoiding me, but then who wouldnt right? sorry im just in a really bad mood right now its not even all about chad either, im so so fucking stressed out its gotten me to the point where im crying i have too much to do in a very very small amount of time and its not fun to think about... *sighs* life really really sucks right now ive got way too much on my plate to deal with right now... maybe its a good idea to take advantage of mr luthringer's offer and go talk to him about things maybe ill feel a little bit better, thats what he's there for so i guess it could do me some good to talk to him about everything, i dont think ill tell him about chad though b/c then he would call my mom i bet but i might still say something just i wont mention his age, he is a lil old for me but if hes willing to go out with me im already his but thats all up to him i guess.... i hope i didnt do anything to fuck this one up, i seem to be really good at it now adays, i fuck everything up really o well i guess thats just me... i read and saved some bolt poems today and that didnt help me at all with my mood so i guess ill just sleep the whole weekend and end up waking up and being brought to tears because i didnt get any of my shit done that i was supposed to. so i guess thats it for now wish me luck w/ life.....

      this week has been a shitty one for me, a very shitty one! since drivers ed started monday ive been going everyday and not getting back home until about 8 then i usually have at least an hour of homework on mondays and wednesdays and about 3 on tuesdays and thursdays... mrs hargreaves-lee is insane im thinking, she gave us 2 sets of notes one worksheet and 40 problems out of the book to do on thursday and im still not done with that, she didnt teach it at ALL so it takes me like triple the time to do the work, right now i have about 5 hours invested on tuesdays h/w and im about half way through its insane! then today we got notes, worksheet, and 36 book problems which i started today and i got about half way through it, this stuff is much easier than tuesdays assignment but still kinda hard. then next tuesday we have the chapter review assignment which is 103 problems long! its stressing me out REALLY bad thinking about that and trying to get everything else done in the 4 hours that im home and awake everynight so tomorrow i can actually come home until about 630 then its off to drivers ed again to drive which i totally suck at, i take turns too fast he says then i dont pay attention to what im doing and i go all over the road, i knew thats houw i would be but i guess ill learn to get better, really all i have to do is slow down a bit and pay more attention to what im doing and ill be fine so its just  going to take some practice, thats all...  I already know what my weekend is going to be full of, math homework YAY! jk its going to be hell i have to finish 2 assignments and i should really get started on the review if i have time but i dont know... so far on tuesday's assignment i have about 5 pages full of work and thats only like half way through! now if a 40 prob. assignment takes up around 10 pages im guessing that 103 is going to take up much more than 10 im going to shoot mrs lee i swear she said that since the work is hard she gave us alot so we can get practice even though we will never ever do this again in our everyday lives so really i guess shes trying to make it part of our everyday life, that bitch! well i havent talked to chad in almost 2 weeks now im starting to think that hes trying to avoid me so im going to send him an email but i dont think he has been at work lately b/c he hasnt posted on his blog in a while so maybe he's just been sick, i know he has been and i really dont wanna bother him so i guess ill wait until tomorrow to email him if i dont see him online, theres a few ?'s i gotta ask him ill post them after i ask him so umm yeah just hold on... right now im thinking that this last 39 days left of school are going to be hell for me, im going to be super stressed like i am now and knowing me its going to bring me into depression that will last forever it seems like so im not in a good situation right now i just need to go somewhere and get away from everything w/o having to worry about a million and a half things before depression sets in on me. so maybe this weekend if i get caught up on math i might be able to just go relax and watch a movie, i have a list of movies that we bought in the past months that i havent had the time to watch yet so i think i might be able to do that if i can get caught up on everything.. damn i just remembered that i still have my sketchbook to do which is 9 drawings due at the end of may and i dont have it started yet, its going to take forever so maybe i might start on that this weekend too and get caught up on french homework since i couldnt do it tonight, i dont have the time anymore to enjoy myself so i guess i better get back to math h/w and keep cracking at it maybe ill get a lil bit farther or something tonight...

      “Imagine waiting to meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then being told that you are not able to devote your life to that person through marriage. Imagine having tons of people look at you differently because of your sexual preference. This is what many homosexuals go through every day. They are faced with many issues that very few heterosexuals go through in a lifetime. It's pathetic that our government doesn't believe that you should be able to marry who you prefer if you are homosexual. They, however, do allow opposite sex marriages because to them that is what they feel is  "right" or "normal." Most of them feel that marriage is a union between a man and woman. Most feel that their religion tells them that it is wrong to have same sex marriages, so that is how they will vote. My question is: Since when do we base our government upon the thoughts and ideas of religion? Since when do we sacrifice the pursuit of happiness of others because a religion is against it? Our country is not based on religion. It never has been and hopefully never will. America is supposed to be a melting pot of different religions, ethnicities, and cultures. Many religions do believe in gay marriages. For example, Buddhism celebrates gay relationships freely and would like to have authority to make legal marriages. So if we do make a law against their religion, then we are taking their right to freedom of religion. If one believes in religious freedom, the recognition that opposition to gay marriage is based on religious arguments are reason enough to discount this argument. Another reason our government is so against gay marriages is because they feel that marriages are for the continuation of the species. However, I think that it is safe to say that the world is in greater danger of over population than under population. It seems that gay marriages would be doing the world a favor by not adding to the problem of starving children. Also, if marriage is for the continuation of the species, then why is it such a "sacred" thing to do? The government is also concerned that same sex couples are not able to provide the optimum environment in which to raise children. Well that may sound like a good point, but keep in mind that murderers, felons, and even child molesters freely procreate every day. If they are allowed to, why not gays? I think that people are just not comfort- able with the situation and that they are going to come up with as many excuses as possible in order to stop them from marrying. Everyone is so worried about all the reasons gay marriage should not be allowed, but they are forgetting that there are far more terrible things going on in the world such as war and our soldiers dying every day in Iraq. How about focusing on the real problems we have in society instead of interfering with another person's happiness for something that should have never been a problem in the first place.” –Courtney Dufour The Chieftain Monitor    That right there in my opinion was one of the best arguments for same sex marriages, it explains from a semi-religious stand point how gay marriages aren’t so wrong as in the eyes of others. And like it says, isn’t the constitution supposed to say somewhere that the government cant interfere or persecute any certain religion, so why then would it be ok to pass an amendment that would go against the Buddhism faith? They celebrate gay marriages as stated by the article, so if an amendment was passed then wouldn’t it prevent them from practicing a part of their religion? Last I knew the government couldn’t do that, but I guess that times change and so called democracies based on equality eventually become Communistic states but hey what are you going to do about it? Its time to get Bush out of office NOW before he has the chance to introduce this amendment, if a such amendment is passed then America will become forevermore the homophobic capital of the world, no more melting pot for us! Just an unfair inequality is what we get… well I guess that I do have much more to say about that but my hands are cramping so ill save it for later…. Chad, umm I know you’ve been busy and sick but if you can call me tomorrow (thurs.) I have drivers ed from 5-7 again and I wont even come home until about 8 so if you can try and get a hold of me, Friday I have it 7-9 so umm yeah, o and I have to take my shower at 11 then go to bed its some dumbass rule the beyotch mom made up lol cept on weekends she doesn’t care so umm yeah just get a hold of me when you can. Melissa will bring her camera tomorrow to take some more pics so umm yeah be ready 2 see “the” pants lo lol ull know what I mean when u c them. Well I love you babe so ttyl!

      i was just thinking before i went to bed tonight why i love chad so much... he was the first person that ever really cared about me the way he does he is the first person that i could ever say that i love you and actually mean something more than a friend or family member. he is my first true love he is everything to me, he is incredibly sweet and his personality is all around awesome he loves me back and i think its the first time that ive been able to say the feeling of love was mutual with another guy, eric was just a dick he didnt love me he was just some shallow ass jerkoff that wanted sex, he would rather screw some guy out on the street then be in a long term relationship so i say he can go fuck off and if he calls my house i will tell him that, now that i look back on it all i dont see how i could be so STUPID! i was supposedly in love with him but then i realized how much of a jerk he was and gave up but i dont think that'll happen with chad, in fact i know it wont because ive thought and thought and even thought some more about it all and i realized that i will always love chad way more than i ever have loved anyone before and this time not talking to him has really made me feel like shit but its ok i know hes been sick and stuff so i can wait but ive never felt the need to talk to someone more. its like a whole new feeling inside of me, i feel great to be able to say it and mean it: I love you chad. right now i think this is the greatest time in my life so far so heres to you chad i will always love you and never forget that whenever you are feeling sick or down just remember that i love you and tough it out i dont know what i would do without you. you are the greatest person i have ever "met" and i really mean that im not just making it up, you mean far more to me than you or i'll ever know there is just something about you that makes me feel really good. you always make me feel good about myself when i talk to you, you can make me laugh, cry, or whatever, and for that, chad, i love you....

      today was a very tiring and stressful day, i still cant remember much of what happened the earlier part of the day but it'll all come back to me soon i hope but idk... so drivers ed was today and it was ok, the guy was really... odd he used too proper english like turn indicators and freeways? cmon how much do you hear that? anyways all we did today was just schedule driving which i have to drive from 5-7 on wed and 7-9 on fri this week so thats going to suck, that means driver's ed everyday this week.. o well ill have my license soon and then i can come see my hubby chad lol thats going to rock when i meet him even though im going to be nervous its still going to be awesome no matter what, i think that we will end up being together for a long time or i hope so because i love him ALOT like most people dont even know its like josh and sara i love chad the same as josh loves sara if not more! he is soooo awesome he is going through detox right now though he's taking a break from drinking and hes really feeling it, i wish i could be there to help him feel better but im not so i feel really bad not being able to help him make it through *kisses* you'll feel better eventually babe you just have to tough it out, but you'll get through it! i promise k? chad still might call tonight, my mom was on the net then my sister called and she was talking to her for a long time so he probably tried to call during then, im offline right now, i just loaded the blogger page and started typing away, i wont publish it until i go to bed and all so hopefully he'll still call and we can talk i know he feels like shit and probably doesnt wanna talk on the phone so its cool if he doesnt call ill understand....  hmmm let me think... tomorrow is going to suck, i have english first thing in the morning so that means its going to be really boring and im going to be tired as hell and i probably wont know whats going on, if i remember right we are just reading julius caesar again so i might be able to catch some z's in there or something i hope so ne ways.... then i have seminar which is usually pretty boring because i dont have anyone to talk to really, its all senior and junior jock/preppy ppl in there so it kinda sux, i have to deal with all the freshmen comming in there since its a freshie class they always like flock to her seminar, god i hate freshies! they are soo... annoying! i hope i wasnt as bad as some of them are but idk i can act pretty immature.... in drivers ed i wrote on the back of my schedule IVE LOST MY MIND WILL YOU HELP ME FIND IT PLEASE BIA? and this guy sitting next to me for some reason had and intense intrest (he was a parent) in what i was doing so i wrote it really dark then i guess he read it and he looked at me wierd then shook his head and went back to taking notes about the license system, wtf was he wasting his time on that for? o well i dont get stupid people sometimes but i guess that im stupid so im a hippocrite! lol there was this kid in there that must of been confused b/c he was wearing some black shoes with blue flames on them that ive seen at hot topic, now these were some tight ass shoes i was liking them i wanna pair! lol jk but then he had on like this bright ass orange a+f shirt and an olvie green coat and pants, im not saying anything bad about any of his clothes just that he wasnt exactly doing a good job of matching himself maybe his mommy should dress him next time? lol omg im so mean sometimes but its all good i spose! well i guess thats all i have to say today im hoping to talk to chad sometime tonight or tomorrow so ummm wish me luck! lol jk

      today so far has pretty much sucked really bad. in biology all we did was take notes the whole hour and i cant say that i remember what the hell it was even about anymore, and that was just 2 hours ago. im extremely tired again i couldnt sleep very well i just kept thinking about chad and stuff like that.... in french we learned some family vocab that i cant remember now, damn i hate being tired i need like a gallon of mountain dew or espresso to keep me awake... o well... we have a sub today that keeps walking around and around so i cant get on aol to talk to chad, it would be better to get caught doing this than talking to chad, dammit i really wanna talk to him too but i guess ill just have to wait until tonight when i get home.... i have drivers ed today for the first time and im kinda nervous/excited about it, im going to be riding in a car w/ josh so at least i'll know somebody there and all so i guess its not so bad, amber said that i wont be driving today, just setting up schedules for driving and then going through the intro to the book or whatever i dont know.... so i guess i better get going *sighs* i have history after lunch so im not looking forward to that and dammit i miss chad soooo much! *kisses* and im gonna say it again, trust me babe i wont leave you for anyone else im definately sure that right now theres no one else, hell i dont care if simple plan knocked on my door and wanted to go out on a date or something i would say no because i have you right? well bye.....

      today really sucked! i had to go to my uncles for an easter cook out and i ended up just freezing my ass off for about an hour then i went inside and we just all sat there and did nothing the whole time it was incredibly boring! my grandpa is doing better but hes really depressed lately, this has taken its toll on him big time! they have him on zoloft but my mom told him to just get on celexa because that's what works for her, she has to take welbutrin though too or she can be a total bitch! i mean worse than she usually is and thats kinda bad! ive really been missing chad he never called but thats ok he was probably out having a good time or something, i know i would be so no sweat. ill get to talk to him tomorrow, jeanne gave me an old phone card that has like 40 minutes on it i think so i guess i can use those up calling him, i should just buy my own 600min one from sams club its only like 20 bucks so thats not bad, hopefully i can get one and i wont have to worry about a damn phone bill when i do call him. driver's ed starts tomorrow i totally forgot about it and its been forever since i drove and last time i did it wasnt very far so im hoping that we dont drive tomorrow so i can get caught up on some driving before i start in drivers ed. i was hoping that melissa and angie would come kidnap me from that hellhole they call a cookout, but i guess since chad didnt come which im kinda glad he didnt b/c my damn sinuses were killing me most of the day and i didnt wanna feel like shit the first time i met chad. jeanne came over tonight and i helped her load up a bball hoop and then she came over and her and my dad measured windows and figured out whats gonna happen with the whole deal, its going to be a lot of work b/c we have the old ghetto fab house that is all shitty and it always ends up being a lot of work to do anything to the house no matter how long you thought it would take.  i really dont want to go to school tomorrow its already stressing me out thinking about it, i know i have a math test this week over a chapter that we did last week so that kinda sucks, i forgot most of the stuff that i learned in that chapter, now that i think of it i dont even remember what it was about so i have to get some studying done for that, i can see it now, im going to get really stressed and then im going to get depressed again and im going to be in a shitty mood probably until school gets out for the summer.... sometimes school is just too much but i handle it so ill be ok.... o shit i just need the rest of the year off so i dont have to worry about anything, it would be awesome! but i know that wont happen so yeah it sucks i suppose.... well i guess thats it bye...

      today was a pretty good day i woke up around 1 and sat around ate some pizza rolls then all of a sudden i jumped up and walked into the kitchen and took the doritos off the table b/c i was sick of looking at them there and put them in the refrigerator, now dont ask me why i put them in there its just one of those blonde moments i guess, i didnt even realize that i did it until i got out of the shower and went to get some oj and they were in my way i was like ummm ok im a dumbass! so that has lead me to believe that im pretty hopeless, cmon i put the doritos in the fridge for god sakes! o well i guess i just had a brain fart i dunno.... after i got some oj i went downstairs and watched my simple plan dvd and i must say that it was some pretty funny shit! some of it was just so stupid it was funny, now i really gotta go to the conert lol! some of it was pretty hot, i must say that they r hot too but chad is way hotter than any of the guys from sp! i mean come on if you dont think chad is hot then you need to go get checked out by a doc or something... speaking of chad angie and melissa called me today and said that he might be coming to djack tomorrow so if he does im going to go w/ them if they can pick me up from my uncles house so hopefully he'll come, if he does im going to be so nervous it wont even be funny anymore! ill be all shaking and stuff ill be lost for words ill probably end up choking up and not know what to say, im such a dork but normal people suck! right mandy? i told jeanne about chad today and she read his blog, well som of it, and she said that he sounds really cool and she thinks hes hot too lol, she came up with a way for him to come to my brothers graduation party in june, she will have him come over to her moms which is next door and say that she brought him so we can hang out and probably get drunk if my mom will let me which i think she will, she let me in texas so i dont see a problem with it or anything. and chad is quitting smoking for me, he says that he doesnt want to loose me in his blog which right now i know wont happen, he means the world to me! he is the best guy ive ever known and the whole smoking doesnt bother me at all, ive lived with it foreve w/ my parents so dont stop just because of me ok? i dont want you to be miserable just because you quit smoking for me, i want you to be happy not feeling like shit from not having any nicotine ok? so dont do it if you dont want to, either way im still going to love you just as much and that alot! well i really cant think of anything else to post right now so l8r!

      the trip was ok in some ways, it wasnt AS boring as i first thought it would be but it turned out to be i guess ok.... the ride down was hell i kept thinking i dont wanna do this just turn around and leave me at home but i made it i suppose, it was a horrible ride through illinois that state is incredibly boring! my mom was driving me nuts i had my cd player on full blast and i could still hear her bitching about some stupid shit! i was about to shoot her ass, when i tried sleeping she kept waking me up telling me how much longer we had to go yet and i was like ok dumb bitch i dont really care! i ended up telling her to shut her mouth because it was giving me a headache from hell, im  mean to her i should try to be more nice but she should be nicer to me for a change, she always makes me do some stupid shit for her b/c she is so damn lazy she would rather see me get up and do it for her arrggg o well so anyways... the first day all we did was sleep in till about 8 which according to my grandpa thats late, he usually gets up about 5 to go eat breakfast and woke us up to see if we were coming everyday which we ended up doing a few times, then we went to the bar w/ him and i had a buzz going b/c he kept buying beers and giving them to me, not the best thing in the world, but i guess it was ok... by the first day and night i was ready to cry i missed chad so much, i kept thinking, i wonder what chad is doing and all that kind of stuff, it would have been awesome if he could've came with us. after we left the bar me my mom and jeremy drove to longview to find a best buy, it took us 4 hours but we found one! i bought the new lostprophets cd and the simple plan dvd, the lp cd is an awesome cd, i know most of the words to it already, i havent watched the simple plan dvd yet, thats on my agenda for tomorrow. then after we got back from longview we went to dinner at tejas which was a really nice mexican resturaunt, i had a wet burrito i ended up only eating a few bites though, i wasnt that hungry really i was just ready to get back to the house and sleep the rest of the night away or something. the second day we went to breakfast w/ my gpa then we decided to go to tyler and see what there was to do, we found a zoo but we didnt go there until tuesday because we ran out of time before we had to get to gladewater again so then the next day we ate a sonics, man i love that place! mmm lol, and went to the zoo, it was an ok zoo but i had to spend time with the fam and it wasnt to fun for me i still had chad on my mind the whole day and the next, well ok through the whole damn trip and i know i will this weekend too since i didnt get home until late. the next day we drove down to temple to get my grandma out of the hospital the next day so we had to run all over hell making sure things were set up right and all so we stayed in a hotel that night, which was a dirty ass one, it was a damn hilton! that bitch was expensive and it had condoms, used, on my moms bed i was laughing but still that is disgusting! that morning we ate at a denny's which was horrible service, the lady gave us a free meal because the cooks messed everything up.... then we drove back to gladewater which was about 4 hours then headed home from there we made it to little rock arkansas before we had to stop and find a hotel, we stayed at a days inn it was dirty again, it had a thing on the wall for a massage shower head that told you how to work it and at the bottom it said, enjoy good, clean fun, wtf? lol ne ways we went to a dennys for dinner and it was awesome service there, the lady was really really nice she sat down and talked to us and ended up not making us pay so we tipped her a good 20 bucks and she was like you dont have to but we did, it was the right thing to do....when we got back to the hotel i fucked my ankle up more than it already is, i stepped in a hole in the parking lot that i didnt see and i was down to my knee i twisted it so bad. it really hurts now i cant put any weight on it without it hurting so ive been limping around its still pretty swollen my ankle was already fucked up from a few years ago and i just messed it up some more so it sucks! this vacation was sucky! well anyways..... chad: im not going to leave you i promise, and you dont have to quit smoking for me im ok w/ it ive lived with it forever w/ my parents so it doesnt really bother me just dont like chain smoke alot that gets annoying but otherwise i dont care that is really sweet what you said in your blog about missing me, you have no idea how much i missed you! *kisses* and dont worry if your ex has to move in with you again, i trust you, i completely understand that you are doing it as a favor, i would do it too if i was in your situation, thats what friends are for to help each other right? well babe im telling you DONT EVER worry about me leaving you! i love you waaaayyyy to much to do anything like that..... i was thinking that we could first meet at the mall w/ like 2 of my friends so that way my mom wouldnt know about it and all so tell me what ya think, i know its not romantic or anything but right now i cant do much more than that, later on down the road i promise that ill plan something much much better! umm thats all that i can think of right now.... hopefully i can talk to chad this weekend to tell him how much i love him lol well...... im out

      i really dont want to go to texas im almost in tears now because i dont want to go, im going to miss everyone when im gone and i wont be able to talk to chad at all so that right there makes things horrible really.... we cant even go to six flags now because they are only open on the weekends and that really really blows! we are supposed to be back on friday so hopefully i'll be able to talk to chad then if we get home early enough which will should since we would leave thursday morning and probably stop in little rock arkansas to sleep so that would put us around 5 or six i would say until we got back into michigan so hopefully im really hoping here that i'll catch chad before he gets offline.... well i guess the only good thing that happened to me today well ok one of a few things was that i got to talk to chad on the phone for about 15 min. i had to cut it off short though because i wasnt on the phone card, his voice is sooo awesome! i cant wait until we go out on a date with each other which i hope will be soon, i have to think of a plan to get out of the house to go on it without my parents thinking anything supiscious since they dont know about me or him yet, i feel really bad for not telling them especially because chad, i feel like im letting him down b/c they dont know him and i think they should but its going to be hard to tell them, im going to do it though because i think that its the only way i can get out on a date with chad and ill just have to think about it on the way to texas or something.... *sighs* im going to miss him so much! right now im hoping for a miracle to get me out of this damn trip, maybe if im lucky ill have some type of allergic reaction to something i ate today and ill have to go to the hospital and i could stay home the rest of the week, if it could only happen....  well ill stop complaining now... matt told jeanne about me being gay to get back at me for telling her that he was going to kill himself i was scared so i tried to help him so the only person that i knew could help him was jeanne so i called her and told her, then he got pissed because he wasnt gonna really do it and jeanne tried helping him about it so he got pissed that i told her and i said what was i supposed to do, just let you go do it? i didnt know that he wasnt going to so i called her... im about done with him, in fact i AM done with him i've had enough of his shit, all i did was try to help him and repays me like this? o well at least jeanne didnt care shes fine w/ it and all but still matt needs to just go kill himself i dont care anymore just let him do it, itll be a much better place w/o him, he does it for the attention and he doesnt care who he hurts in the process so im just going to ignore him i'll probably just block him or something.... jeanne is pissed at him too because of it she said she will kick his ass next time she sees him or just yell at him next time he calls her, i cant believe he did that o well so im just going to ignore him from now on, after i give him a piece of my mind of course... o and guess what my crazy ass neighbor did? she hacked down all the lilacs again just like last spring, we found out by me and jeanne walking out behind to check on them and we found out the dumb bitch cut them again so we went and picked up the pieces and as we were walking back up to the front yard sylvia comes rolling on up in her van so me and jeanne just stood on the property line and stared at her she said what are you looking at, jeanne says you. then it went on from there how we are living in a dream world and that she didnt pull up any steaks and didnt rip down any no trespassing signs, who the fuck said anything about tresspassing signs and steaks? she just told on herself, i said if we were living in a fucking dream world you sure as hell wouldnt be in it! jeanne asked her if she would like to go to jail for malicious destuction of property like she almost did last spring for the same damn thing she said r u threatening me? i said no dumbass that was a fucking question you fucking retarded crazy ass bitch then shes like o well you stole a bunch of shit and blah blah i asked her waht shit? she coudlnt tell me so i guess i didint steal anything.... we are filing a blight report with the township about the pool and her sheds that are illegal since they arent 10 feet away from the property line and the house and the electric pole along with the now 6 year's no use swimming pool and her truck underneath a tarp and guess what jeanne is doing monday? calling child protective services on her, her daughter has to stay locked up in the house all day w/ all the windows borded up all the time and when they are outside sylvia's calling her a little bitch and how shes going to kill her... so that girl needs out of there once cps gets on u they will be there for a min of 6months and if you dont let them in they go get the sherriff and break in the damn house! everyone has about had it with her, i mean barb wire fence didnt even keep her out of the damn lilacs so now its time to take the legal route.... well im out for a week so if you want you can email me, i wont get it forever but ill get it, im reallly going to miss chad im going to cry i know i will i really really hope i'll be able to catch him friday before he leaves if he does leave i will just call him or something..... I LOVE CHAD REIMANN! *kisses* lol

      today i spent most of the day at josh's and when i came home i hooked my lil pc back up and started a good ol' game of monoply, i forgot how to play kind of for a second but after about 2 min it all came rushing back to me again which is good because the computer was starting to kill me damn lol im such a looser but thats ok b/c well yeah loosers rule! well i lost that game being the looser that i am so i decided to put the computer on super easy and the game lasted 3 hours, shows my skill, lol but i won it so its all good, it must be all the chemicals from the hair shit that i put in everyday... then after monopoly was over i started reading for english, i read this story about antartica and scientists on some ship that was exploring it, it actually seems like a really really beatiful place, the narrator was talking about how she came to have strange love for the place and once she was there and adjusted she had no desire to leave the barren land. so that made me think, yeah that is a nice lonely, beatiful place, no civilization, the only life other than your own being kelp, algae, whales, seals, fish, and penguins, just something about it makes me set a new goal for myself, somehow someday i want to visit antartica to see the vast lands of floes moving apart among the swells, water vapor from warm water coliding with the much colder air, wow that just seems really beatiful to be able to see the sun dogs at sunset/sunrise would just be amazing, i should look for pics of antartica, i know you say im crazy for wanting to visit there but i say im just different and you are boring because well it's true maybe idk lol im weird so deal with it! that story was really good, it had lots of descriptive words in it, thats what reading is all about, painting a picture with nothing but words and your imagination, its great stuff.... ok now onto the tv... i watched two and a half men, that is just a good show its funny along with raymond that show is great idk why, its just good mind rotting tv, something you dont run into often nowadays, it was a good break from reality and stupid parents.... well thats it for now because well im dull and i have nothing else to talk about...

      Well I got to thinking down in this basement… I know it’s scary when I think but what are you going to do about it? Anyway, I just need to move on because obviously Chad has so I will too… I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself for all that crap that I did and forget about it, maybe find someone else if that’s possible in this hellhole of a town. I guess that if im lucky ill find someone that I wont fuck things up with… I think that as soon as I graduate high school im going to find a college REALLY far away from this place, this place is just too much for me sometimes, even with its tiny size and all. The people here are nice and all, most of them anyway, its just the few that aren’t that I cant deal with, like all the damn little cliques in school I hate it when there are a bunch of preppy people that think they are better than everyone else. I really hate the people that buy their kids brand fucking new cars for their first car and then say that their families are dirt poor, I mean come on I have this ghetto ass 1990 Bonneville that needs some desperate TLC and THEIR families are poor? Get a fucking clue people, you aren’t poor and you probably never will be… Ok im done lashing out at people now, I do that a lot in case you haven’t noticed, im like that, I mean look what I did? Oh well its over now and I just have to try and move on… I seem to be doing a lot better now today, last night I was really, close to just taking some pills and being done with it all, but I ended up scaring myself a little too much and not doing it obviously… Well I need to go now, and don’t worry I’ll be fine from now on…

      well it looks like chad is going to be gone forever to me, he probably wont ever talk to me again, i kind of figured that would happen but i still had that little sliver of hope in the back of my mind but now its faded, i dont have any hope anymore it sucks... i talked to jeanne about the whole thing and i was about to start crying but i just kept holding it back because i know that if i would have she wouldve been right over here and i dont really want that... right now all i want to do is just curl up in my bed and fall asleep and never wake up again, that's the way i hope to die, if i have to go an alternate route, fine, at least it's still death right? wow i havent felt this bad in a long time not since last year, the hellacious year, it hurts alot to know that i fucked up the best thing going for me in my life, he was the only thing that i really looked forward to everyday but now all i have to look forward to is coming home sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself while the tv blares in the background... i found myself sitting in front of the tv for 4 hours today and just sitting there in a daze like i blocked everything out but what was going on in my head, i cant even remember what was said around me or what was on the tv, i was looking at the tv though i just sat there.... im such a wreck, i dont feel like talking about it anymore so fuck it....

      ... to fuck eveything up.... i always do it... i finally read chads blog today again and he updated it and right now i feel like she because of what I've done to him, i shouldnt have been so quick to just think that he got mad at courtney for no real reason, i shouldve just waited until i knew more about the situation before i just went ahead and sent that shitty email to him... dammit i really hate how i ALWAYS mess things up whether it be everyday life or something really special i always manage to screw things up, whether i try to or not that's a different story... i really love chad despite whatever stupid shit i always do, i didnt want to make things worse for him with that email but i shouldve known that it would have but i didnt really think about it, i just went about doing my thing like i always do and didnt even stop to think one moment about it, i do it all to often i just do things without thinking and thats what makes me so damn stupid, stupid enough to fuck everything that i love up... i mean look at what i've done i never took any consideration to what chad was feeling and he is right, i was being really really shallow about the whole thing and finally i now understand what i've done to him... i will certainly understand that if he never wants to talk to me again, i wont bitch him out or anything all i want him to do is to read this post and know that im really really sorry for all of the shit that i've done so if you can forgive me then we'll talk, if you dont talk to me again i'll just know that you wont forgive me and i guess that if that's what you want to do then go ahead do it, it's up to you... i wrote this and was meaning to give it to chad today so i'll just post it on here.... there's more that i want to add so here it is... you arent the asshole jerk or whatever else courtney and i called you, i am and so is courtney for doing that. so accept my apology or dont i'll understand both ways...  *****************************************************************************************************  Well ok, I figured out that I REALLY fucked things up, I should’ve never just assumed that you just bitched Courtney out without reason, well I now know that you did have a damn good reason but I found out from her after I sent that bitchy email that she started on you first so, I don’t blame you for doing that, I think I probably would’ve too, so I’m really sorry about that… and I was thinking the other day about that day we met and I just kept thinking about what went on that day and I’m not sure but I think I know why you didn’t want to call me back afterwards, I think that it was because I had all of those people there, to be honest I did invite some of them but I never anticipated on most of them showing up like they did, so, matt wasn’t supposed to be there and I really don’t even like him along with Kelsey Katie and Taylor but I like Katie and Taylor so I wasn’t quite as annoyed as I was by the others… anyways I do some really, really stupid things when I’m around people like that, well I bet you already figured that out, so, I want to apologize for all of the stupid stuff I did which was just about everything. I know that I shouldn’t have sent you that email I feel really bad for it now because I know you already have it hard enough right now and I should’ve gotten both sides of everything before I just blew up on you so I’m REALLY sorry for that I know it was really shitty of me… And I’m sorry for all the stupid stuff I did that day and now that I've thought about everything a lot more, I think I might have things a little more clearer, I did the stupid shit so I’m sorry for all of that. I definitely understand that if you never want to go out with me again I won’t be crushed because I know that I messed it up. So if you still want to be friends even after I fucked all that stuff up, awesome, if you don’t I understand your reasoning, I was an asshole and I’m sorry for it all ok?

      ive come to the conclusion to slack off for the rest of the year except for when exams come i might study a bit, but im not going to do homework anymore, its just a big waste of time! and i have too much shit going on other than school so i dont really feel like doing anything. this shouldnt come to a big suprise or a suprise at all to you, i tend to do this every year its just this year im under different circumstances than previous years so as far as im concerned im basically done with school for the year... i wore my do nothing kings shirt again today and i really like it i think i want more, they are just so cool looking i think i like them alot! lol i need a blue one w/ the wings and black text now that would be awesome there, maybe it would match my hair! speaking of my hair it looks like it might have faded a little bit but not much so i hope it doesnt fade anymore because this stuff is just awesome and i dont wanna loose it! i need to start saving up for the simple plan concert because i think that we might stay in a hotel the night before or something and i have to pay for a room then i have to get at least one shirt. im thinking about finding some really good simple plan pics on ebay or something and buy them for autographs that i hope i will get a chance to get, ill wait in line all damn night if i have to, im GETTING THEIR AUTOGRAPHS! dammit and no one is going to stop me! im supposed to go camping with josh and joeseph with basically nothing but a tent and some hammocks, i dont think my mom will let me go for the whole weekend but she might just for one night at least i hope she will, she better or i'll be pissed but knowing her... *sighs* well im going to go get a yogurt becuase i just had the sudden urge for one lol

      fantasia WON! im sooo happy i love her style its awesome! i might actually buy her cd, i know that sound really gay, buying an american idol cd, but hey go figure am i right? i was getting very annoyed at the finale it just kept dragging on and on for 2 hours i was like omg just fucking announce the winner and do all that bullshit later! ughh stupid tv, im starting to become myself a little bit more i guess, i feel bad now about that email that i sent to chad because i was talking to josh today and he said that he had talked to chad and he said something like im one of nates friends so are you going to talk to me or w/e and he said well as long as you dont bitch me out... so that made me think that i was a little too harsh and that maybe courtney got a little bit too bitchy at him so im going to send him an email apologizing to him about that email i sent him, maybe he'll just want to be friends because he really is a cool guy and i probably wont ever have a chance with him but he's still cool to hang out with so maybe we could do that... i dont even want to go to school tomorrow since i missed tuesday i'll be behind in all my classes so that kind of sucks.... i guess it will be ok, we are having a "pizza" party in seminar for the seniors tomorrow so that's a day of nothing in there, i can just sit like i usually do and try and catch up on some sleep if i can... in math i have a test which im not ready for so i think i might go see my french teacher and ask her for help on it since she can teach it better than the damn math teacher, whom i hate in case you didnt notice already, what a bitch she is... well i guess thats it for now, wish me luck for making it through the day tomorrow!

      this weekend started out as a 2 day then monday school was cancelled and i had my doctor's appointment today... i found out that i have to have my nose totally rebuilt on the inside, i cant get any air through it at all so thats not good, he says that it is getting worse, i have to get a cat scan in 2 weeks to be sure if there is anything else that needs to be done when i have surgery that it gets done. i have surgery scheduled for june 21st so that way i can still go to the simple plan concert and all... chad really really pissed me off, he called courtney a cunt just because he tried to get him to talk to her since he wont talk to me or anyone else about what the fuck was going on, so its over i've definately had it with him, i dont care what he has to say now, you dont fuck with my friends like that and you certainly dont pull off the shit that he did and expect me to act like it didnt happen so fuck him, all i have to do is exchange necklaces with him and then i dont care if i ever talk to him again because what he did really hurt, i mean come on all he had to do was to call me and just tell me that he didnt want to go out with me, i never thought that it would take THAT much of a man to just do that, but i guess it does and he isnt man enough. what a jerk... i wont be so quick to judge people now becuase i have learned better, i was so quick to think he was cool but now i know that he isnt, that was probably all just a show to fuck with people o well i guess you're bound to run into jerks like that sometime or another...

      the storms are still coming one after another, its getting quite annoying! yesterday was enough cass wont even have power unitl around wednesday so it sucks to be them and hopefully i dont loose power because i would have to wait even longer than cass does. it looks like the highschool has power back now so that means school will be in session on monday *sighs* o well this is our last full week of that hellhole for 3 months so i should be happy but im not really... im going to miss all of my friends like last summer since i cant drive yet w/o my mom or dad so that pretty much blows monkey balls... i got back from the relay for life a little bit ago and it was kind of boring i wanted to stay kinda didnt because jake's band is playing tonight from 1-2 and 3-4 so that wouldve been something to see... monday im just going to get all of my hair done in blue i want it that way so i can stand out a little more because standing out is awesome, its fun to be different, because normal people suck! lol taste my RAINBOW MANDY! lol i just had to say it, i have a feeling that i wont sleep tonight since im not tired at all, i might just go mow the damn lawn, its not like the mower doesnt have headlights on it so i think i might do that after i get offline just for something to do, i started it yesterday and now i only have a little bit left to go so i probably will finish it tonight... the county tried to get that limb out of the street again today but they cant, they had a plow and bulldozer there again and could do it so idk what they are going to do, its still hooked up to the three and being held up by like 2 others so its "tangled" up pretty good, i think im going to steal a traffic cone from there, they are all reflective and stuff! well thats it for now ....

      well today started off to be really really dull and i kept falling asleep in english then after lunch things started to get a little more exciting... we were in history doing this holocaust simulation and i was in the "shower" room for less than 5 minutes before i went in there the weather was fine just looked a little grey then i come out and its going insane with really strong winds and rain that kept blowing the windows open then the ceiling started leaking and things were getting REALLY REALLY bad outside, the power went out and then mr lehigh came around and said to get into your tornado positions after a while and things just kept getting worse, kids were trying to get a hold of someone outside of the school to find out what was going on and no one could get signal so everyone kept trying and trying then power came back for about 5 minutes then it went out again and finally people began to get through, at first everyone kept hearing over and over that there was a tornado in sister lakes and sarah began to cry because her dad and brother were supposed to be working outside on their house today and she was freaking out since she couldnt get a hold of either one for like a half an hour. then things began to clear up and kids filled the halls and we found out that there were trees down everywhere blocking the way to get to the school and that no city near us had power, everything was down... one kid's car got completely crushed by a tree in the student parking lot and the library hallway was flooded because of the shitty roofs on the school the water just came in like it didnt have anything to go through. eventually the buses got there and we all piled on them and my bus driver had just gotten back from a field trip with little kids and a big ass limb came through the side of the bus it didnt hurt anyone, it just broke out some windows so she still had the bus, it was soaking wet on the bus like all the seats were cold and wet, it just sucked, we then had to navigate our way through dowagiac with power lines down everywhere a long with trees, we eventually made it out of town so then when we went to drop taylor off we couldnt even get near to her house b/c there were about 5 trees in the way, so we had to make her walk then drive in reverse down the road so we could get back to the intersection to turn around. then we were going to head onto dillman street and the whole road was covered in limbs and trees so we had to go backwards once again to the intersection and turn around to go find another way eventually we made it to my house and my road looks like a damn warzone with a huge ass limb down that the road crews cant move, they had a bulldozer and a snowplow trying to break it off the rest of the way then they even cut it and they cant move it anymore so there is this HUGE tree limb hanging down into the road now with cones around it, i had to walk about 1/2 mile just to get home from the bus since she coudlnt go any farther on my street. luckily i didnt have any damage done in my yard and we still had power so i was happy, now more storms are on there way and wish me luck in keeping power...

      no not from partying but from a day of being in a REALLY REALLY bad mood like almost blowing up on everyone for no reason, and from almost crying in history because i felt really sick and things just arent the best they could be right now... so sorry to everyone if i was bitchy at you today i just wanted to be sitting at home, alone, isolated from all the shit that i dont really feel like dealing with sometimes. once i got home i started to feel a little better until my mom started blabbering on about gay marriages again and i try to bite my tounge and hold my feelings back but i almost just blew up on her but i held it all back and as hard as it was i did an ok job of i it just sat there and said yeah, ok, yeah, whatever i dont really care what she thinks i know there is plenty of people out there behind gay marriage and we wont stop until it's "legalized" in all states. president bush *sighs* announced again to urge congress to pass a constitutional amendment to outlaw gay marriages, that just pissed me off he needs to realize that he's in the whitehouse not the pulpit separation of church and state right? last time i checked the constitution says we the people and equal rights for all in the land, well we the people means we need to fight for our rights as a whole and stop the government from violating those rights. its time to stop bush now get him out of office before its too late i urge you to contact your senator and congressman as soon as possible to stop bush now in his efforts to discriminate against homosexuals and if you're old enough to vote dont waste your oppourtunity to do so vote against bush and his discriminatory ideas. there is only one person that i can express so much disgust and hate and that is our "leader" president bush, our leader to a hateful society...

      today was ok i guess, idk anymore life just sucks right now *sighs* things will get better sometime i hope.... in computers we tried to play a trick on mrs welke buy going into mrs wanko's room while she was gone and hiding but mrs welke came around the corner as we were getting ready to leave so it didnt work... i emailed today in computers too, he hasnt emailed me back yet but he will i hope. i hope i didnt fuck things up like i usually do with good things in my life im such a dumbass it pisses me off sometimes how stupid i can be well not CAN AM i am soo stupid sometimes i dont even know why i keep going on with life but i guess i have something to look forward to so thats keeping me here... i used to think it was chad and well i still do its just the way things are i dont know anymore like everytime i talk about it i want to cry, i thought he was the one, i guess not since i never get to talk to him, i dont want to break up with him at all because he is my first realy boyfriend but since i never talk to him things just dont work i need to have a long talk with him to sort things out and the way things are going right now i dont think that it's going to happen any time soon so i have to be patient... this year is almost over and when it does finally come to an end im going to be much happier i think the summer has some good things to bring this year, im going to see simple plan and that alone will be cool and if me and chad are still going out then we can have some fun this summer and if we arent well we can still hang out, no reason not to, chad is awesome! well thats it for right now i need to take a shower and make an attempt to sleep a bit last night i couldnt sleep because i kept thinking about all kinds of shit that i still dont want to talk about on here yet because well yeah too many people read it to talk about... that....

      why are all math teachers so bitchy? especially mrs lee, me and alicia were in seminar today working together to try and figure out 8-5 after mrs lee "helped" us all she did was make it more confusing. so anyway we were just sitting there talking to each other about a problem and she says nate are you doing math or are you just talking i said both because i cant figure the stuff out she says well i already explained it once so just figure it out on your own, i almost blew up on her im tired of her shit all the time she is always being a bitch to everyone and she never teaches anything she just writes stuff on the board and expects us to interpret and understand it all god forbid we have a question she bites our heads off if we dont understand it... dammit why cant school just be over already its starting to get really annoying but i guess since we only have about 3 weeks left it'll be over really quick so i guess that can be a good thing... this summer will hopefully be better than last, last summer just plain sucked! all i did was sit around the house and that got on my nerves really really quick hopefully if everything works out with chad we can hang out this summer sometime... well i guess thats it for right now...

      it seems like lately that i have been feeling more and more depressed lately and i want it to stop i just want to be happy and not worry about anything like the week i met chad, that was the best week of my life it was a really high point in my life then i come to this past couple of days and i have been missing chad alot and questioning if its going to work out and the way it's looking right now well, its not looking good right now and that really really makes me feel like shit but i guess i'll just have to move on if it doesnt work out for whatever reason i just cant stop thinking that maybe i did something really wrong and now chad doesnt want me but i dont know i just need to talk to him, i'll try to get a hold of him again tomorrow and if i cant i guess ill just have to wait but once i do i think me and him are going to have a long talk about things to try and figure it all out no matter how long it takes im going to figure it out with him.... i have been loaded with math homework since mrs lee refused to teach the sophomores what they missed last thursday so i have no idea what im supposed to be doing for that section and we have a quiz on it tomorrow so im pretty much screwed plus i have test corrections to do in seminar tomorrow so i have to get those done to bring my grade up a bit higher that it is if thats possible... i hope things get better soon because its starting to be too much for me and well yeah bad things happen when i get really depressed and i dont really feel like going there again anytime soon, or ever for that matter. i just need to have a long talk with chad and see whats going to happen there because its getting harder and harder not knowing whats going on i hope he is ok and everything is fine for him because last time this happened well bad things happened to him and i really really hate to see him in pain i want to help him alot more than i am now, i just have to figure out a way to do it... im going to talk to danette again this week, last friday i told her thanks for giving chad a hug because it meant a lot to me that she didnt have any hostility, she said no problem, just because i dont agree with gays doesnt mean i dont care about them. that meant a lot i dont have as many hard feelings torwards her anymore which is a good thing because she is really there to care not to hate like i first thought she was... well i know there is tons more on my mind right now but i just dont feel like talking about them right now so i guess thats it for this post...

      it REALLY REALLY hurts to say this like im crying and ive never cried about another guy like this... im not sure if me and chad are going to work out, it always seems like he is avoiding me, he never calls me back or anything, so chad if you are reading this, im not breaking up with you, we just need to talk thats all i want to talk to you definately before i decide anything and even if we dont work you you know that i'll always love you its just one of those things that might not work out so if you dont feel the same way about me then just tell me thats all that i ask you so just tell me and stop hiding it if you are please? do it for me ok? i really love you and i know that if something does happen like if we break up im going to be crushed but i guess now is better than a month down the road alright? you are my first real love and im not trying to push you into loving me so just tell me ok? i would rather you tell me now then just break up with me someday. and remember i am NOT breaking up with you right now im just saying that we really really need to talk about things before its too late ok? so please just get a hold of me somehow ok?

      today was extremely boring all me and josh really did was do things for his parents which kinda tired me out... well at least i had a really good breakfast, its like a bed and breakfast over at josh's house lol last night was fun though, joe brought over his laptop and air panel and we were playing w/ that for a while outside along with all the adults sitting around the fire on the deck getting hammered and making some pretty funny jokes, joshs mom kept talking about how the mens bathroom has pubes everywhere because guys sit there and scratch the twins lol that was too funny... this morning i woke up semi early to eat breakfast then we left to go get some beef w/ josh's mom and then we came home and chilled for a while then worked out in the garage which wasnt bad at all then around 3 we had to go in the ghetto truck to go get some shit from the marshall moose which took us forever i just wanted to get out of that tiny ass truck but i lived so w/e... we went through kzoo i kept looking for chad but i didnt see him that wouldve been cool if i did, i might have even persuaded dale to let me get out and go with him! that would have rocked right there. nothing much has really been on my mind lately, ok well something has but i dont really wanna talk about it just yet, i need to figure things out before i talk about it so im just going to keep it in for right now so umm yeah thats it for tonight's post i think..

      right now im sitting in computers and i got all of my work done, again, so now i just have to sit here and find something else to do until the bell rings which is another half hour or so.. i guess i could be doing microtype but im not in the mood to do anything right now so i probably wont. tomorrow is going to be extremely easy because all of the sophomores are giong to the "career day" at the smc djack and niles campus idk what it is but i guess we just go around and see classes that are related to our job intrests, big whoop i dont really give a shit about that i just wanna get out of school and have it all waved. im so glad im done with drivers ed now, i can acutally come right home after school and then i can talk to people or do whatever and not have to worry about leaving or my mom coming home so thats great. im going to call chad again tonight probably it was funny last night hes crazy when hes drunk lol he rox! im hoping to go to the battle of the bands thing this weekend i have to talk to ashley about it today, if chad cant come then ill get courtney to go she said that she didnt care so im set... hmm well i have to go since i dont have anything else to say right now....

      finally drivers ed ended today and that makes me really happy and plus i got to talk to chad today too! he was drunk lol he was on his way to burger king and he just kept driving down westnigde (sp?) even though there wasnt a bk there but he just kept driving lol he said he couldnt multitask lol hes crazy but i still love him! it was really nice to hear from him again finally *kisses chad* wow it was great i didnt talk to him for long though but it still rocked his phone cut out or whatever i think when he left so hopefully nothing bad happened and it was just his phone. I wanna go to battle of the bands this weekend with chad or some people its at silver beach saturday, i think its like a 12 hour concert thing idk chad's band played there last year he said they got like second if i remember right. so thats cool i need to hear his band sometime it would be awesome i think just like he is! i think im getting my permitt tomorrow so now i can drive with anyone over 21 or 18 i dont remember right but they'll tell me so w/e... jeanne is coming over tonight so thats cool too she rox 2 but chad definately rocks more! he said that he needed to loose weight today i told him he didnt but he still persists that he needs to but i know he doesnt, his body is great as it is so he can just keep it that way in my book.  hell actually it doesnt really matter to me, he could gain a 100 lbs and i wouldnt care he is still going to be the great guy that i'll always love! today was a great day pretty much, mrs. lee wasnt here so all we did was like this 3rd grade math packet that was sooo simple so that means everything is pushed back a day and we didnt have homework that was a load off my chest, i still havent started my art sketchbook, i need to get started its due in like 3 weeks and i dont have anything done in it yet, i hope i can get it done, i should be able to, i waited till like 3 days before it was due and i got it done, that was the first sketchbook, and i got like a b on it i think so that was cool i guess idk im bored now i need to find something to do this weekend if i cant go to battle of the bands because i dont feel like going to my uncle chris's my aunt is apparently anti-gay so that kind of sucks i know that if she finds out about it that she will talk about me behind her back but thats ok everyone else does and i dont really like her that much in the first place so she can talk all she wants to whoever she wants, doesnt make a difference to me... i think im going to buy those tickets from ashley this week if i can and im getting simple plan tickets tomorrow, my dad forgot to leave his credit card, but once i order them i guess they will just email them to me for me to print if i understand it right so thats cool too, i cant wait until that concert, i dont think i can get chad a ticket im going to try and figure out a way, im really really hoping that i can get him one, hopefully i should just be able to lie to my mom and tell her that whoever it is that im getting the ticket for doesnt have the cash so they will pay later and she'll let me so i have to try and pull that one and hope that it'll work but i decided to wait until im about to buy them so that way she has less time to think about it, damn im kinda evil but thats ok im just a lil odd...  hmm i know that there was something else i was going to say but now i cant think of it so w/e... I LOVE CHAD!

      im finally off vicadin for a while they were starting to make me dizzy and sick and everything was like in a haze... being on vikes for a while isnt bad i must say but when you are on them for days at a time they just start to mess with your head, like i stood up one day and my dad said ur about to fall over and i didnt hear him so i just kept on and i got dizzy and fell.. so yeah i cant handle them that well, they arent even very strong ones either only like 500's i think and i didnt take to many of them so idk what the deal was there... i went to the doc today and he pulled the stitches out and the packing in my nose and now i can breath a lil, i gotta spray saline in my nose for a while though and keep it cleaned out so it doesnt crust over and get really really disgusting, its not pretty when its crusty lol im not so swelled up today so thats another good thing about it all i can sleep in my bed finally instead of in my damn recliners those things hurt after a while and i can swim now too since its just saltwater im spraying up there i figure that pool water wont hurt at all, heck it might even help to clean it out a bit... i went to courtney's tonight to get a haircut and a hair dye it looks awesome! i luv it! nice and short, and best of all... BLACK! i luv black hair i need to get my cam charged up and take some pics and post em for u to see, i love black hair! and my nails are black now too so thats awesome. i cant wait until saturday b/c there is going to be a lil get together at the drive in with marty, courtney, and their friends from decatur, there is lots of hotties that are going to be there so thats why im looking forward, mmm eye candy lol when we were at courtneys we kept talking about all the hot actors and stuff it was pretty fun they think denzel washington is hot! *pukes* hes just a lil old for me, maybe if he was younger i would.... gosh i need a boyfriend, just someone to talk to and hold and go stargazing with some night when its warm and clear, that would be heaven but the way it looks its not happening anytime soon... i keep finding great guys on the internet but they are all like in fl and all kinds of weird places so theres really no hope there.... i mean come on i loved steve and i still do its just he lives in the uk and well yeah that just doesnt work in a whole dif continent! well i have to go im about to fall asleep at the keyboard, very dangerous you know!

      surgery went really well today for the most part anyway. i was only under for about an hour so that wasnt bad when i woke up i felt really really tired and i had a horrible burning sensation in my nose so the nurse gave me something in my iv to help with it, since it didnt work she gave me a shot of demoral i was arguing with her she said that i dont want no fucking shot get that away but i didnt even feel it... the first thing i said when i woke up was is it night? b/c the clock said 9 so i thought wow i was sleeping a long time but i didnt so yeah thats cool. pre op was uneventful all they did was check my blood pressure which was low again, they were worried about it but once i woke up it was 145 over 90 which is really kinda high, they said my heart is just screwy about that, my mom has the same thing it cant keep a steady blood pressure but it doesnt cause any trouble for a while yet so im not worried... anyway in the op room it was super cold so they put these hot blankets on me and they felt good, the guy that knocks you said ok in 20 seconds youll be out so think happy thoughts ull heal better so i kept thinking about the simple plan concert and it was awesome! lol then after surgery i have this face band holding gauze on my nose since it will bleed steady like a bloody nose does for about a week or so, and i have that horrible feeling of blood dripping down my throat and it is sooo sore from the tube they put in me to breathe too but its going to get better i hope... i have to sleep in the recliner for a while since i cant lay flat or bend over because if i did they said i would probably have blood in my throat and i would drown in it, so yeah LOTS of bleeding right now and some mucus too, its quite the nasty lil job i got going on right now but itll be better. it hurts like hell if im not on my vicadin, right now im not feeling a thing except happyness lol i luv vikes they work so good! they're some extra strengths too! *dances* lol well i better go get something to eat and take an antibiotic!

      after all that i said in that post i thought i had things figured out but i dont now im just in a crappy mood before surgery and im starting to get into one of my depressed lows again, and that's definately not good when surgery is tomorrow because your body wont heal as good when you are depressed, or at least thats what i heard. so yeah things are still on my mind that just wont leave no matter how many times i tell myself that i'm over all of that i'm just lieing to myself to think about what i almost did that saturday night, no one wouldve known except my parents when they wouldve came down to get me up for my uncles party so yeah i was so close that night to just ending it all, i had the stuff to do it, all i had to do was take a few pills, mix them a bit and i wouldve been out cold and never woken up again. i scared myself that night i kept thinking about all of my friends and what they would have to go through so i stopped myself... i did semi over dose on benadryl i could hardly walk straight and talk that night when i went to bed but i slept it off with the only side affects being a migraine the next day. so yeah... things are still on my mind about how i screwed things up and yeah they wont go away im not looking to get back together with him or anything its just i wish i couldve at least talked to him before it all went downhill and well i guess that wouldve made me feel better. but i guess i just messed things up too bad and i didnt deserve it which i understand why, i dont even really wanna go into that story it was the worst couple weeks of my life i remember sitting there in history with alysia talking about something i didnt care about and mr stanger was telling us to take notes and i just sat there about ready to start bawling i had to fight and fight to keep it back i didnt care what was going on, thats all i could think about when i wasnt occupied with better friends that i enjoyed to be around more than alysia i just kept thinking about it and i cried one time in there i just put my head down and wiped my eyes when i was done, i was quiet about it and i didnt want mr stanger to see because i knew he would tell me to go talk to mr luthringer and at that time i didnt want to even hear chad's name but yeah im starting to get better now about it, its just been a really low point right now i cant stop thinking about it all. one thing that i would thank chad for is getting rid of all the posts from when he first started his blog, i used to read them all the time and i would start crying my eyes out for hours when i read his posts and its hard to think about them now, i remember one was like a vow kind of thing to me it was so sweet i read it after it all happened and it was just too much for me to take i was like omg wow that was great when i talked to him still, i remember sneaking around on aol in mrs welke's class to talk to him everyday and i would be just so happy the rest of the day but yeah, no more of that, no more.... its like that article i had on here, i should try to not and forget things because you cant forget the great things in your life, remember them and never forget and you'll get over it, there is life after love... look at me im still here i pushed on no matter how hard it was im still here and i know why... its because of all my friends... so thanks for being there for me everyone you dont even know how much it means to me to have all of you to talk to helps me so much... if it wasnt for you all i wouldnt be here so i owe my life to you thanks...

      after dinner i went back to sleep because i was really tired and i didnt feel like eating really anyways so i had a piece of chicken and felt like i was going to be sick so i went back to bed. when i woke up, about an hour and half ago, i felt like crap i wanted to just go and jump off a freakin' cliff , my head was pounding and i had that one thing on my mind that i almost ended everything over, i just kept thinking about him i still do every once in a while but this time i was like crushed by it. idk why i thought i was over it so i sat and thought about things for a while i figured i should just go back to sleep and sleep the things off since that's what i do or i could put on some music and think thorugh everything. so thats what i did, i put on something corporate and i just sat here and i cried a little but i just kept thinking and i have came to a conclusion although its probably bad in your point of view but it makes me feel better so i figured its good for me, maybe not you... well ok anyway i was thinking about how i screwed everything up, it wasnt just the email thing i acted really stupid around him and thanks to some people out there, you know who you are, i found out for sure that was the first mistake i did, so i thought about that a little longer i've figured it out, sure people think im great on the internet but im completely different in real life, the internet is like a whole other world to me, i act different, i talk different, and i feel different about myself, as it turns out most people are kind of annoyed by me in real life, and dont ask me why i think this because im pretty sure you know why... so as i figure it all i need to try and change myself to idk become more mature and act smarter than i do because if you ever talked to me mrs. perdue you wouldnt think i was all that smart because i act kind of.... idk... odd sometimes.... so what i'm going to do is try and change myself a little, its time for me to grow up... ok my second conclusion is that unless i dont change i'll find anyone that i will probably ever see in real life no matter how much i like the person, you see, steve, he is a great guy and i pretty much think he is amazing but not unless i dont get some money fast i'll never see him so no matter ho much i love him it'll probably never work, no matter how hard i try, internet relationships just never work im not going to give up though because you know what steve i really like you and i dont wanna just let another good thing slip through my fingers like i usually do... so i need to change and i need to change a lot if i ever want to find someone, its not that i want to just go find someone and screw them because i like to think that im smarter than that, ive been through health class before, many times before, and everytime i learned what'll happen if you just go around o i wanna have sex and just do it, youll be sorry later i dont want any std's that stuff is something id rather not play around with lightly, i mean come on so what i use a condom that wont stop em sometimes it could break or something and then ur screwed so think about having sex first k? well lol i sound like a teach or something... ok so there's eric and there's justin, eric is a cool guy and all and so is justin but justin wants to have sex i mean come on look what he tried to do? well anyway, eric is cool and i just dont see myself with him i already told him that the reason why i dont go to his house is because i dont want to have sex already or anything i wanna wait for a while and he said he was too but i just dont see me with eric idk just something about that.... so from this blog post onward i hope to be at least a little bit more grown up, ive had plenty of time to think things through and i think its best after what i did its time for a major change, no matter what you think i wanna change so thats what im going to do... wish me luck

      today was pretty boring for the most part right now im listening to simple plan, so far i've listened to the WHOLE cd about 4 times today and I'm working on number five right now so thats just wicked awesome! i NEVER get tired of simple plan, because well yeah they ROCK! anyway... today all i pretty much did was read the whole day im such a looser i read the 5th harry potter book today and it turned out to be a really good book, i figured i'd rejuvinate my love for fantasy books since i had nothing else to do. i kind of regret it though because well yeah my eyes are pretty much screwed, i have bad eyes as it is and well staring at a book for about 6 hours just doesnt help at all, i should've put on my glasses but nah they are just a hassle so i dont bother with them anymore. right now its really hard to focus on the screen but i'm dealing with it... well after i finished the book i had a horrible headache so i took some tylenol and it actually worked on me which is a first! my nose is driving me insane today, its really really plugged up and i cant get my ears to drain for the life of me, today they bled for a good hour before they would stop so i had to wash my hair again because somehow i had blood in my hair lol idk how that happened must be some projectile stuff or something idk im weird like that... when my mom got home i was about to go insane, she wouldnt shut up omg she just kept talking and talking and talking i was like omg how much do you have to say!?! it would be different if she actually talked about something i thought was important like when we talk politics we will go at each other for hours about that which is fun because i usually end up winning with her lol its fun to live with a republican sometimes... speaking of politics they had a poll on bolt today about bush winning the election, most people say that he wont but i think he will because Kerry is an idiot and well lets face it bush is too but he appeals to the christian and most middle class citizens which is pretty much the majority in this country. i see it as a loose/loose situation either way we will have an idiot for president so we should just suck it up and elect Kerry since bush is fond of torture and discrimination, to me, that isnt a very good image for america by any means. that poll reflected what teenagers thought which makes me want the voting age to be even lower to around 16 because if you talk to any highschooler chances are that during a presidential election year they are opinionated about who they want in office and would love to be able to vote for their choice but well yeah thats not going to happen, if it would though i can garuntee you that bush would be packing his bags and saying goodbye america and i would be saying good riddance you tyrant but thats just my opinion and if you dont like it o well email me sometime and we can talk politics if you want...

      i cant believe that i have finally grown tired of all of my music... i cant believe it! you would think that if you have 1800+ songs you wouldnt get tired of them, well ya do, i hate to say it but ive grown tired of blink, yellowcard, limpbizkit, new found glory, linkin park, the rasmus, afi, default and w/e wow! I NEED NEW MUSIC! i get tired of listening to the same stuff over and over and over again. two bands that i havent gotten tired of yet though are simple plan and good charlotte because well you just cant get tired of them no matter how many times you listen to their music it just never gets old. since simple plan is my fav band i have to listen to their cd at least once every other day if not everyday, its just the best thing in the world and thats why i have promised myself to ALWAYS buy their stuff and not just accept a burnt cd from a friend, you have to support the band you love and well you all know i love simple plan which reminds me only 39 days left until the warped tour so that is going to be rocking my world and i have an idea for that since camping is only like 25 cents we should stay there overnight the night before courtney so we get good pit places, right up front so we can get noticed courtney that would rock and you know it would! it seems like im in a much better mood now and i know why, you do too steve ;) lol earlier i was frustrated and mad for some reason and i just felt like punching something until it broke, idk why i felt that way, i just did then like 20 min later i was sad again then i got mad and well now im happy and i know exactly why!

      ahh its great to be back home with all of my stuff again, i've been at joshs since monday and i was starting to get a lil bored and i was missing my boring home life again... all i did monday at joshs was chill then walk to town i think ne ways, then yesterday i sat down and watched some fuse all day then we chilled out on the deck and his cousins came over and they were over for a while and we didnt really do anything but sit around... then today i watched warped wednesdays on fuse that was awesome they had nfg on there and they were pretty funny plus all of the great music vids that is just awesome. btw courtizzle u gotta tape something on fuse for me its saturday at 3 and its celebrity tastemaker, its 2 hours long i think and its going to have sp, blink, and some other band that i dont care about on there, sp i cant miss that and then on wednesdays they have a warped wednesday and u might wanna tape that 2 b/c im sure sp is going to be on that too sometime in the near future until the tour is over. so um yeah... im starting to get kinda frustrated now, im not going to say names, but theres this guy that i know that is pretty cute and all complaining about not having a bf and being single forever. ok first of all if they just looked for someone they would find someone without any trouble, second think about it for a bit, they have a great personality and they are a flirt so yeah... anyways i dont feel like talking about that right now... im kind of depressed right now, i think its just because it is summer and i miss everyone now idk people are starting to get on my nerves though so thats not helping, i miss steve most of all but i do miss sam and ppl like that still. wow i am making a whole lot of no sense so im going to just go lie down since my head is throbbing and i just feel like crying for no reason right now....

      "Over the past week I made a few phone calls. I called his parents, a friend of his and a friend of mine that still lives in SoCal. In return I got two disconnected numbers (my friend and his parents) and a very cryptic voice message prompt paired with an unreturned call (his friend). I just don't know anymore. Over the past week I have read many b/n's and board posts wishing me sympathies and offering advice and I thank everyone that offered their condolences and otherwise. I finally made the phone calls, but I am afraid that I was too late. Maybe his friend will call me back, not that it means I will learn of his whereabouts; maybe his friend won't, and…I'll just have to get on with my life.  I don't throw around phrases like 'soul mate' or 'the one', that level of romanticism just doesn't work for me. I don't know why, I just can't work with it. It's too permanent, final, narrow. I have thought about all of this a lot recently since I vented my heart's frustrations and I am still against using those kinds of terms. I won't say that he was 'the one'. Why would I do that to myself? Unfortunately, as much as I want to see him again, my inability to abandon reality (that whole logic has its limits conundrum) I'm afraid that I may have to come to the realization that I may never see him again. If I were to label him 'the one' and I don't see him again, that would leave quite a void to fill down the road. 'The one' is so final. I cannot do that to myself.  There are circumstances which I cannot discuss here, things I know about certain lifestyles and choices, that I have to take into consideration. And these things constantly remind me that as much as I love him I cannot spend my life wishing. The cynic in me rears its ugly head again.  I love him. But I have to come to terms with the idea that I may never see him again. I never could grasp the hopeless romantic ideals. I fell in love. It didn't work. I got my heart broken. It happens. It happened. It will probably happen again. But, there is life after love; there will always be life after love.  I'm sure that a lot of people will feel that I have given up, or that I didn't love him in the first place. People can think what they want; only I know what it is I feel. I cannot hold on forever, I can still love him (and perhaps love will fade with time, perhaps not) but I cannot lie to myself anymore. As I write this, it hurts, but I know that the longer you hold onto something the harder it is to let it go. Considering the way I feel now I am confident that if I try to cling to this any longer I may not be able to let it go. And where would that leave me? I don't even want to think about it.  So now begins the process of getting on with my life. It's not about forgetting, it would never be about forgetting. It's about remembering what we had when we were together. It's about remembering how the song he wrote for me sounded. Remembering his face. Being able to smile when I hear his favorite song. Remembering hours of driving around in the Benz obsessively changing CD's to make the perfect play list. Remembering what it was like to lie in his arms and watch the perfect sunset and scan the horizon for dolphins in the dark. Sometimes I still feel his hand on the small of my back…a tangible reminder of memories turned landmines." -paLmtreeundOne   That was a really good article i read on bolt.com tell me what you think, i think it was really meaningful and just plain awesome...

      i havent ever realized how lost i am when my computer is down, its like im severed from a whole different social life, i love computers because well they satisfy my hunger for social interaction without having to worry about how i look or sound or what have you. my life on the internet is full of life, there's always someone interesting to talk to on my list... anywho... last night i decdided to try and put red hat 9 on my computer, well sure it sounded like a good idea until the installation went HORRIBLY wrong and it destroyed my partition tables rrggg! so i lost EVERYTHING, that kind of definately pushed me over the edge, i kicked my computer desk and since it is a piece of shit ameriwood particle board or w/e it split like right down the middle on one side, yeah thats nice! this morning i woke up to complete hearing loss, my dad came in to wake me up even though i was already up, i had blood all over my pillow and i seen his mouth moving but i couldnt hear him so i said what and he kept trying to talk to me but i couldnt hear so i went upstairs and took 2 zyrtec d's since they help clear up my sinuses a bit, within 2 hours i got most of my hearing back. then i ended up with a horrible headache that i still have, so far the tylenol count is 8 and nothing has touched it, but you know what I DONT CARE lol its like extremely close to overdose taking that many but it doesnt hurt me obviously it didnt do me any good either but i hope to have this gone tomorrow since its the party tomorrow... bad memories have been coming to me lately yeah i dont really feel like talking about them because all of the memories have to deal with me being extremely close to ending it all so yeah.... anyway.... tomorrow i get to meet my new cousin that my aunt laura and uncle ken adopted, hes 13 hes had a rough life, hes doing good now with the family and i just wanna make him feel comfortable around us and just give him someone to hang out with tomorrow so hes not just completely oblivious to everyone, he'll get to know some of us. im excited about tomorrow since i can see addie, shes awesome lol shes really funny lol well hmm thats all i can type now my head is killing me!

      I just finished this  urlLink article  on yahoo entitled "Memo Says Bush Not Restricted by Tourture Bans" excuse me? what the hell? read the article and you'll understand exactly what i mean. apparently we have such a wonderful presidential administration that does SOOOO much for the people they look for legal loopholes so they can use torture to interrigate POW's, it seems to me that the administration's top senior officials are very fond of war, well we already knew that, but they are also fond of using torture to squeeze answers out of prisoners. first it was bad enough with rumsfeld covering up the iraqi prisoner abuse, that was bad, but now with this memo coming out explaining the loop holes to get around our own federal laws prohibiting torture AND international treaties made at the geneva convention, thats just disgusting. i've said it before and i'll say it again, its time to STOP bush NOW, not just bush himself but more importantly his adminstration, this has gone too far, first lying to the nation to lead us into war and now this? if bush stays in office, we all know what will happen to gay marriages and dammit if i could i would fucking sue the federal government if a constitutional amendment was passed banning gay marriages i fucking swear i would. im getting tired of having to be the silent voice of america, i want to be heard! ive had it... im writting to upton VERY soon! its all that i can do right now even though its not nearly enough im still going to do it, nothing goes in vain..... well thats it for now im too worked up to talk about today so ill just put it in w/ tomorrow....

      its finally the last two days of school! yay! lol eric and justin showed up at my house sunday i was like omg wtf are you guys doing here? they were looking for matt so i took em over to john and amy's and we hung for a while... eric and justin tried to get me horny, it didnt work lol i wouldnt let them i just ignored it, besides i'd rather get horny thinking about steve ne ways lol :p exams started today and they were easy, i got a b+ on my history exam, suprisingly, i didnt think i could even pass the damn thing, but i did so i'm happy.. idk what i got on biology yet, he hasnt corrected them, i think i sucked on that one like i usually do in that class *sighs* i forgot my stuff to study for english and math at school today so im screwed, and here comes the stress, i didnt do ANY studying that i planned on for the classes that i need the most. im definately going to fail the math exam its going to be sooo hard because well shes a bitch and she refuses to teach me anything, idk what i ever did to her to make her hate me in the first place but now i argue with her all the time and she always gets pissed off at me but i dont care she i such a bitch she can suck it for all that i care... in computers we didnt have exams because the websites that we made she made them count for it instead so i was happy about that, i just screwed around the whole hour like usual so i could just b bored the whole time, i was hoping steve would get on, he did but i missed him :( that sucks! if he had aim i wouldve gotten to talk to him since thats the only way i can get to any outside contact besides these c boxe's around... i like aim better bc its more private.... my brothers graduation party is saturday so im probably going to get drunk lol if my mom will let me, she probably will since she will be drunk 2 lol i went for my ct scans today, they took a whole 10 min, it was like a big donut that spun around really fast over my head so i didnt even have to go into the tunnel, i hate those things! so i'll get the results on that next week sometime, he looked at my ear and said that it was just my sinuses that are having some extremely difficult times draining so thats why it bleeds, its just getting rid of the pressure, he said to keep an eye on it if it starts to leave big spots on my pillow at night and wont quit then to call him right away so thats kinda scary, he said i could end up loosing most of my hearing in my left ear because of all the recent pressure on it, so that kind of sucks! surgery is almost here so im happy about that, im going to feel like shit but i need it done already.... hmm well thats all that i can think of so far....

      this year was actually the best year of my life... as the time draws near to the beginnig of summer, i cant help but stop for a minute and look back at what a great year it was.... At the beginning of the year it was great to see everyone again as we returned to school from a long summer, everyone had loads of stories to tell about what they did or what happened to them over the summer. we all promised to get together last summer every week so we wouldnt get behind in whats going on in each other's lives, after a few weeks we stopped and didnt talk much after that so the first day of school is always great, you see how everyone has changed, and what the year is going to mean to you finally... as the year drew on i began to come closer and closer to comming out, everyday i thought about it, it kept becoming more and more of an issue in my mind, i wanted to tell someone but i just couldnt... so then what i like to call my "niles days" came to be, i started to talk to keems more and more and then we started going into chat rooms and i met eric and justin on there with keems, i soon learned about eric and justin and i increasingly became to like eric alot, we would go into chat rooms all the time on the weekends till like 2 or 3 in the morning having a great time until i couldnt possibly stay awake anymore. so eventually me and eric started talking on the phone and it was cool and all then his mom got rid of the internet so i ended up never really ever talking to him anymore so that just kind of changed the way i thought about him, sure i missed him a lil afterwards but then i just got over it and had a great time. the "niles days" were at an end... then i came out to melissa and it turned out to be the greatest thing that ive done in a long time, she was totally ok with it of course and i started to feel better about myself again, it felt like a big weight was lifted off of my shoulders, suddenly everyone knew about me and i didnt have to live 2 lives anymore and it was great. after that i started to get really lonely because well friends are great and all its just they cant comfort you like a boyfriend/girlfriend can (no nasty way either) so things got steadily worse for me and i just kept thinking no one was out there for me until i met chad and we talked for a couple months and then met and things just fell apart from there, im no going to get into that right now its behind me now... after me and chad ended i came close to overdosing on any type of pill that i could get my hands on but i stopped myself because i thought about everyone that i still had in my life, it was then i realized that without chad i wasnt any different i was just a friend short was all so i put that behind me and now im pretty good, sure i still get lonely now but ive been talking to steve for a couple days now and he's awesome (sorry had to say it bud!) so things are pretty good right now, exams are coming and a great summer is yet to come, with the warped tour 2 times this summer (july and august) i have something GREAT to look forward to, along with going to the  urlLink liquid room  with melissa and courtney its going to be an awesome summer, plus a few ventures to the mall to got check out hot topic and just hangout, thats what im really looking forward to besides the warped tour, this summer is going to be full of great things it appears... this year is going to be great and this past year was awesome.....

      I was thinking about something to write about earlier today while as I was mowing the lawn... Then it came to me, why not write about Simple Plan? So yeah, once again, I'll write about Simple Plan since it's been on my mind for more than a long time... I really like SP because all of their music is real, it all comes from the heart. The music can do whatever you want it to, it can give you a sense of hope or sadness, it's all up to you they just put the words and the music out there in a great way and you take it all in, sort of like a sponge. Then in your head you decide if you like it or not and if you do it will invoke a great feeling in your head, with SP feelings get invoked that I could've never even imagined until I heard their songs, particulary "Perfect" and "Crash and Burn". Their music amazes me and helps me to figure things out if I'm confused or upset about something, it always helps me to be who I am and never forget that who I am is who I am no matter what someone may say to me, I'm not going to change. Another reason I like SP is because they are really nice to their fans, particulary Chuck, they didn't let it get to their heads, they haven't forgotte who they are and what they were like before they were famous. Chuck amazed me at what he did for Krissy, it takes a dedicated artist to go up to a fan that's in emotional trouble and make them feel better, I mean some artrists ignore their fans and think they are above them. I think Chuck has to be the most amazing person I know right now, he took the time to comfort someone who he didn't even really know and didn't ask for anything in return. It's great how people do that, they would help someone they didn't know if they needed it, those kind of people make the world a great place to be. Lastly, SP members are really hot but that doesn't really matter :p! I was talking to Melissa today about finding a boyfriend and taking him to prom this year if I had one. I kept saying it was so lonley without someone to call "the one". I used to know what it felt like, well maybe it was a false sense of love but I felt that I really loved him a lot. I can remember wanting to talk to him all the time in Mrs. Welke's class, but yeah I don't feel like talking about that right now, it still hurts sometimes.... Well I don't really know what else to say, I'm off to the Family Reunion this weekend which is really fun so I've been kinda busy with getting things ready for that...

      Well today thanks to Krissy again I got to talk to Chuck for a bit. He is so amazing! He asked me why I wasn't there today so I told him that I couldn't find a way to Kentucky he's like that sucks! Then I heard just a little while ago that Krissy told him about the fight with her ex and he hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek so I'm a little jealous but I'm more interested in details about the fight and such. So Krissy I'll give you a hug *hugs*! I hope you are feeling better right now I really want to hear about it if you want to talk about it so yeah... Email me since I'm at Josh's right now... Jackie left a really good comment about the "Old Friends" post. It made me think a lot about the old days again... She's right you didn't have to worry about what people thought because everyone thought you were cool back then, you could be yourself and not have to worry about any cliques that wouldn't like you or what have you. You can still do that today if you try hard enough, I think. You can be yourself and not care what other people thing or what cliques think about you. If you do that though you wont have any friends unless you can find a group that likes you for who you are and become friends with them. So I guess thats all you can do is just be yourself and not worry about being popular and just go with whoever likes you for who you are. I guess that really didn't make much sense but I tried... I hate it when I think of a good thing to write about then loose my complete thoughts on it and end up with a mess of words that don't make sense... Meh, I guess I just like to blabber... I found some good quotes from firehot tonight, so I'll post them down at the bottom. Im kind of down tonight for some reason it's just another low is all I'll be back up soon I hope because you all know it sucks to be down and not know why you are... I keep thinking about things that I know I shouldn't and I'm guessing the lack of sleep isn't helping out too much. Man I hope I can sleep tonight!

      Tonight, well just a minute ago, I got to talk to an old friend back from Lincoln we didn't talk very long but it was cool. It made me think back in the day when we all used to be friends, the whole class were friends with each other except for the few that were outcasts I guess you could say. It was great times we all would hang out at recess and have all kinds of clubs and such that really didn't do anything. We all could relate but then Pat Ham days came along and ripped us all apart, it was odd to go back to school and not see all of your old friends in your class as past years. At first I wanted to be with everyone again, I wanted to spend all of my class time with them but then I got used to it and made new friends and lost others in the process. I still miss talking to some of them, others I could care less, but the friend I talked to was Jackie and I always remember being good friends with her. She was really cool we used to swing all the time, I did that a lot, I would hang out with the girls on the swings rather than going and playing whatever the boys did. So I guess you could say I even knew subconciously back then that I was gay, and Jackie if you happen to read this , consider this me telling you... I don't remember having feelings for the guys or anything then, in fact I had a crush on Amy not any guys... It was weird I got along with the girls so much better then and I still do. Anyway... I more than likely wont sleep for yet another night, I'm still in amazement about Saturday and it's still just all wow to me right now. Plus Krissy is going to call me tomorrow from the Simple Plan show on another Warped show and try and get Chuck on again so with that to look forward to I just don't see how I will sleep... I drank a whole 2 liter of Mountain Dew today too, so that's not going to help with the sleep issue. You know what? I don't care because rumor has it, there's a meteor shower tonight at 4 am and I wouldn't miss it for the life of me. I love the night skies, I could look at them for the rest of my life with my true love beside me and never have a complaint in the world. It would be amazing... Stars are just so amazing, you could take everything away from me but the stars and I would be just as happy, well I would miss Simple Plan... Well I think there's a 40 page paper on "Prophecies Unfulfilled in the Bible" that's calling my name... This good stuff, really it is.

      I still didn't sleep very well last night... Still tons of excitement my way, so I think this week will be hell as far as sleep goes. I have been extremely excited for the past few days I still can't believe it all happened. It's just so surreal but so great at the same time I can't wait until the next Simple Plan show, it's also going to rock! I still haven't washed my SP shirt and I probably wont for a long time, I have it hanging on a hanger in my basement so I will see it over and over. It still smells new so that's good, maybe even a little like Chuck did :D! That show was amazing, truly it was, I have never felt that before in my life to see them play in real life was a mind blowing experience and then to meet them, well that just almost pushed me over the edge, I want to cry because of it I wish that the feeling would last forever but unfourtunately, it wont! Anyway, last night I was talking to Stacey and Courtney while I was shopping around for some Role Model shirts and some shoes from Hot Topic, possibly shorts also... I figured I'll get 10 shirts from Role Model and then some shorts, shoes, and a studded pyramid belt from hot topic. Yeah this year I'm going all out punk, that's my style I don't care what my mom says that's what I'm wearing from now on... Punk! I love the look! Well, as for now I must leave... My brother could call anytime....

      Well, as you ALL know yesterday was the Warped Tour in Chicago! I can sum it all up in one word... AMAZING! I'll give details though as I promised.... Here goes... The ride down was boring but once we got there I started to flip out. I was like are you ready? We're in the same place as Simple Plan want a listerine strip? It was insane I mean wow! The lines were long but we went around to the back and got in a lot earlier than everyone else did. they separated boys from girls for the pat down search and the guy that patted me down was really hot so I told him that and that it wasn't a very good pat down and I demand another one, he just smiled and laughed. Then once we got in there we headed straight to the Simple Plan booth and met Patrick :D he was so cute! He was pretty funny too! I bought a Simple Plan cuff and then went on to the Army of Freshmen booth as I promised Emma. I asked Chris about her and he's like yeah I remember her! She rocked! And they told me to say hi to her for them. So after that we wandered around the booths and Katie bought a Sugarcult shirt and Courtney bought some patches and guitar picks from them. So after that we ended up back at the Brian stage (where Simple Plan was playing later that day) and we saw David from Simple Plan and we found out what tour bus was theirs and we waited there looking for the members and finally Pierre came out :D! I screamed Simple Plan rocks and we love you Pierre! He was like at the other end of the little fenced in area behind the stage and he looked at me and gave me the rock on sign! Then he walked by the fence and I'm screaming come on Pierre come here! But he had other things to do so he didn't. Then Sebastian walked right by us and we didn't even notice! I was so mad we didn't notice! Then after about another hour it was about 15 minutes before Simple Plan was going on stage and Chuck walked out and we were like come here Chuck you gotta come here! He said no I can't I have to warm up and did a drumming movement, he was so cute in person! So then we went over and got close to the pit and when they came on I was screaming sooooo loud I was screaming at the top of my lungs and they started to play and Pierre goes "Everybody jump, jump!" so we all started to jump like no one there wasn't jumping. Then Pierre was like you know we could only pick a few tour dates this summer because we are behind on the new CD but we said we ARE going to Chicago because they love our energy and always get hyped up with us! So they kept playing and when they would let us sing everyone in that crowd was screaming the lyrics and it sounded louder than they did, you could see the amazement on their faces it was amazing! Then after their show was over they were over at their booth and I bought a shirt that I'll have to take a picture of and got in line along with Courtney and Katie we waited for like 4 hours in line but then they left so we were bummed! But we met this cool girl in line and she was going to see them in three more days so she said she'll get autographs and send them to us so that rocked. So then we went and sat down at the Volcom stage and had some dinner then headed back towards the Brian stage since Sugarcult was playing in a few hours. We stopped back at the Simple Plan booth and Jeff was there so we got autographs from him then headed back to the stage and layed down next to the fence by the gate. David was there when we got there so we got his autograph and I asked him for a hug and he said sure and gave me a hug! Courtney is like NATE HUG ME! So I did, I almost cried when I hugged him! Then he had to leave so we sat back down and like a half hour later I see Chuck walking up and I shot up like I had a rocket in my but and screamed it's Chuck! Everyone was like huh? Then when they seen him they all jumped up too and he gave me a hug and autograph and then he left and he came back like two times. So the second time I talked to him and then the third we were talking to Melissa on Courtney's cell and I asked her if she wanted to talk to him, she said yeah so then we went up there and I said Chuck can you talk to my friend Melissa for me? He like was really busy and said yeah sure and dropped everything and talked to her! He's like "Hey Melissa I just called to see what's up, (pause) well I gotta go I got things to do!" then he gave me the phone back so then I'm like do you know who that was? She didn't know so I said the drummer, Chuck, from Simple Plan and she just started to scream! Oh yeah before Chuck Pierre came up to the fence and I was like five feet from him then he had to go so I didn't get a hug or autograph so that sucked! Let me tell you, Chuck WOW he is AMAZING! He was SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER cute in person and was REALLY NICE! I was in a haze! Anyway when Sugarcult played it was the last show of the night so everyone was there jumping and moshing and singing. It was amazing Pierre was up there on stage and I kept looking at him and stuff it was cool! So everyone was jumping at one time then some girls said send me up! So I picked them up with like no trouble even though I'm weak and sent them up. It was cool then after it was over I could barely talk my voice was out and it was over so we went home. But at Hardee's there was alot of fellow Warped Tour goers and we talked to one of them it rocked! Well that's the most amazing day of my life! I got hugs from them! WOW! *Screams*

      Tonight has slowly gotten better... I went from a massive feeling of depression to a great warm feeling inside! I owe it all to my old friends that I've known for a long time and some more recent ones, they all say things to make me feel good. They will make me laugh or feel like im watned in this world. Thanks for the comment Courtney it meant a lot to me! Well that's it for now, because well, I'M TIRED!

      I'm in a depressed mood even though I should be in a really hyper-excited mood. I don't really know why but I just want to cry my eyes out, just a little while ago I was feeling really good and like I was ready to take on the world. Now, however, I feel like going into my room locking the door and sleeping all weekend and shutting myself out from the world. I know I shouldn't feel like this and I don't why I do but I do. I don't know anymore...

      Having a blog is a great thing, it's a great place to say whatever you want or just get your feelings out... Kind of like a diary, but you already know that so... Today this guy, I'm not exactly sure of his name though, instant messaged me saying that he reads my blog and all so that's cool. He pretty much knew everything about me, there is some stuff though that I don't dare put on here so he doesn't know everything and my friends don't either... Well anyway the good but weird in a way thing about having a public blog like this is that anyone could stumble upon it and read all about your life. This isn't always a bad thing, but it can be odd at times, like when this guy talked to me tonight I felt odd that he knew everything about me and I knew well, close to nothing about him. So I guess you could look at it as a way to meet people and such or to see how others feel about things or whatever else you wanna know... OK that thought is dead now, I thought it was going to be something good to write about but it's not anymore so skip it! Well today nothing much happened, all I really did was steal some more of Josh's DSL, as is to be expected, and then went to the VanBuren County fair with Josh's family. The fair was pretty good I suppose, we didn't get to do much because by the time we took Kaitlyn around the Kiddy rides the storms started rolling in and they had to shut down all the good rides so we just ate and left for home... The storms I guess were really bad around Niles and Edwardsburg a Tornado was reported on US12 but whatever it doesn't matter to me.... The sirens kept going off here in Dowagiac for no reason it seemed to me. Well I don't really feel like talking abotu anything else so I'm done rambling now!

      It appears that my video card (ATI Radeon 9200) doesn't like to play nice with Windows XP SP1 or Unreal Tournament 2004. What a rip off?!? Even with the newest drivers I have even more problems. For one, with the new drivers, I can't even really do anything with my computer unless it's in safe mode, it keeps crashing and eventually VPU recover can't bring it back out of dead lock. How fun? Then with the old drivers at least I can use my computer I just can't play Unreal Tournament 2004 or I get the XP blue screen of death! NOOOO! I HATE that screen! I'm going to have to e-mail ATI tonight and see what they say about it, maybe I'll get a new video card out of the deal! ;)

      Wow, Josh finally got DSL today and I'm like so happy that he did! I brought my computer over to steal his internet and I ended up reinstalling Windows last night and I did all the updates today in like 15 minutes! It's awesome! I would say that it is running faster than the schools T1 line! Wow lol well I better go because I got stuff to download!

      Tonight I probably wont sleep since it's so close to the Warped Tour and I got on Simple Plan's site tonight to see the recent updates and a video caught my eye, Pierre doing the acoustic tracking of a new song "Welcome to my Life". Let me tell you IT IS AWESOME! It's the best so far that I've heard from them besides "Perfect", it sounds like a softer song and that's what I've come to like. The addition of an acoustic guitar is amazing I think even though I haven't heard much of it I'm LOVING IT! I wont sleep tonight now since I'm REALLY excited about the tour I mean wow! I'm literally shaking right now!

      Right now my head is pounding and nothing will even touch the pain, I can't take aspirin yet because my nose still bleeds some, and I can't take Ibprophen because it messes with my Celexa. So yeah I'm pretty much screwed, I just have to wait this one out I suppose. I hope it goes away pretty soon, I've taken 6 Tylenol now and they haven't done a thing for me! Headaches are like the biggest annoyance I've ever experienced. I think this one is a migraine though, I can't look at anything bright without it making my head feel like its going to explode! Well anyway, I managed to mow today, that was such a fun time! Let me tell ya! It really wasn't that bad since I had my Simple Plan CD in the whole time so that kinda got me in a better mood. Speaking of Simple Plan, I have to talk to Courtney about concert plans since we only have 5 days left. I'm not sure the best way to get there and all so we have to set all of that up pretty soon. I checked the weather for Saturday and it is 76 and Sunny so that rocks, the UV index is going to be high though, 9, so I better bring some sunscreen or something meh maybe not, I actually like a good sunburn. Well, I must go now, I need to go lie down or something, maybe it'll help...

      Well, I'm really bored and its almost 3 am, what is there to do besides post on my blog? Nothing that's about it in this ghost town! When I graduate high school and finish college, hopefully University of Michigan, I think I want to either move to Southern California or northern is just as good or New York City. I'm tired of the small town atmosphere, I need people all over the place, strange people that you don't know and people you can be someone else around them. I would try and be myself most of the time but everyonce in a while you have to mess with people I would think, but you have to be careful about who you mess with and all. So anyway I'm extremely bored and those sleeping pills are kicking in but I'm not dont posting yet so :p! Josh is gettting DSL that really sucks! I want it so bad but of course, It doesn't come out to my house. He got a really nice Linksys wireless and ethernet DSL router, its 80211.G so that means it has decent bandwidth and distance. That is going to rock, you can take the laptop out on the deck underneath the awning and talk to people, now that would be the life. I love to talk to people sometimes, they are really cool some of them anyway. You never know who you will meet on the net and become friends with, you can find some pervs out there too, like if you go into a gay chat room on Yahoo with your webcam on people will say give me a show or something, so I just hit the good ol' block button if they just want sex but if they are just horny and are actually a good person, I'll say no but give them another chance at it. The Warped Tour is only 5 days away now, not counting today, and as you are aware I'm pysched, it will be so awesome to finally meet Simple Plan, they are the best band in the world as seen through my eyes. There are some other bands though that have gotten my attention like Story of the Year, Breaking Benjamin, Coheed and Cambria, Army of Freshmen, Matchbook Romance, and Sugarcult just to name a few, I'm hoping to get some of their music here pretty soon, I'm dying for some new music, the same 1,800 songs get to you after a while! I was supposed to go to Venetian Fest with Eric today but dumbass me didn't remember until it was too late and I ended up staying at Josh's house the day instead, so yeah there I go again... Well I guess the sleeping pills are REALLY kicking in so I'm off to bed here directly, right after Unaffected by Hoobastank of course, oh, and Kaitlyn I need to talk to you... again so hurry back from where ever you are as of late!      Here's a good quote...     After all, not to create only, or found only, but to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded, to give it your own identity, average, limitless, free. --Walt Whitman--    Think about that, and you won't be so boring perhaps... Just kidding, but yeah that is a good quote I thought!

       I'm finally back from Josh's I was there since Thursday, very exciting... Yeah right! It wasn't that bad, at least we found something to do most of the time even if it was just walking up to town or something like that. We almost ended up walking out to my house just for something to do but his dad wouldn't let us! GRRR! *smacks Dale* lol  Today we (parents and I) went to my uncle's resturaunt in Niles, he always hooks us up there. He cooked up like 5 appetizers that were already on the table when we got there, he said it was on him so that's cool. I ended up getting a chicken salad since I wasn't really THAT hungry I just wanted more of a sanck I don't know. Well anyway we went back into the kitchen to see my Uncle and one of the cooks there was really hot and he kept like staring at me then my Uncle introduced me to him, his name was Justin. Then me and him just started talking and he hit on me, he's like nice eyes! I just said thanks and said his were nice too, so yeah that was kind of weird to have that happen. After that we left, damn I should've gotten his phone number! Oh well, he probably isn't worth my time like alot of other guys but there's a few good ones out there *cough*brian*cough*! lol So yeah, today was extremely boring as to be expected but you know what? WARPED TOUR IS NEXT SATURDAY!  I'm like so hyper about it, it's going to be so awesome when we go, I can't wait to meet Simple Plan. Oh and this week.... MALL! Maybe anyway, I have to work it out with a few people...

      Well, as you should know, the Federal Marriage amendment got shot down yesterday which was great news to me. It wasn't the last vote to take place though, as early as next week there will be another attempt to ban gay marriages. So, you can definately be assured that next week I'll fight just as hard. So anyway, yesterday I didn't really do much I just read some more on that book, im almost done now only 50 pages to go! Jeanne is going to read the book too when I finish it. It's really good, boring at times but I feel A LOT smarter reading it. I learned several new governmental phrases I LOVE IT! lol You know I wouldn't be suprised if I shy away from the whole computers career thing because as of late I've been extremely political and I'm starting to like it, one day I want to make a difference in this country. Well, that's it for now, I have a doctor's appointment to go to!

      Today has been a very important day for me. I have been fighting against the Federal Mariage amendment as you know, and even though it's not expected to pass I still had to fight against it in any way that I could. I'm not worried about the vote tomorrow, in fact I'm quite confident that it wont pass, but don't me wrong, this vote is as important as any on this issue and we need to let our senators know how we feel about it again and again. I called Senators Carl Levin and Deborah Stabenow's offices today and talked with their aides about the issue. Both offices informed me that the senators were against the amendment and I further pressed upon them that discrimination does not have a place in our constitution, the amendment would take away 1,000 or more rights to gays and lesbians nationwide, and I'm not about to sit back and let it happen. I promise I will do ALL that I can to stop this amendment from ever being sent to the states for ratification, this issue may appear to be over for a while but I can definately assure you that it will come back and I WILL make sure that my voice is herd. I'll drive to Washington DC if I have to, I WILL fight and you can count on it!

      I ventured off to the library yesterday now and picked up this book it's by Eric Alterman and Mark Green it's title is "The Book On Bush" then underneath it has a subtitle "How George W. (Mis)leads America". It is by far the best book about politics that I've ever read. I'm only into the second chapter but so far it is  really  good, the stuff that Bush does behind America's back is astonishing! For example: in Bush's 2000 presidential campaign he vowed to protect the enviroment by implementing tougher pollution laws and putting a stop to logging industries hunger for more wood. Well, it turns out those statements were both lies, since Bush's campaign was and still is funded by many big oil companies and logging companies he actually made pollution laws voluntary which according to his theory will make the companies want to clean up some how... Then take this for another example, Bush started a "Clear Skies Initiative" according to Bush it would set lower pollution levels on Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides, and Mercury in Bush's words: "Clear Skies will reduce air pollution from power plants by seventy percent, the most significant step America has ever taken to address this problem--while using a market-based system to keep electricity prices affordable for hardworking Americans." wow, that sounds like good plan doesn't it? Listen to this though, on a short term basis, Bush's plan allowed 125 percent more sulfur dioxide, 68 percent more nitrogen oxide, and 425 percent more mercury than laws already in place. Now going back to his statement, did it clean anything up? No. Did it drive electricity costs down? No. He actually put the laws into place to drive costs down to the electric companies, they didn't have to spend money on pollution prevention, Bush claims it saves money, sure it does for the electric companies but costs billions of dollars to an increased number of hospitalizations. Honestly when will someone stop him?

      The time has come to let your voice be heard against the Federal Marriage Amendment! We can't let this pass, there is no place for discrimination in the constitution. Contact your senators ASAP! If you really are against the amendment then call your senator today and let them know how you feel, let your voice be heard! If there was ever a time to act on your political views it is now, don't sit there and let other people call for you, it wont work, this is too important to be lazy. Call them now! We can't let our government discriminate against millions of gays and lesbians nationwide. It is time to take action against it, our country isn't and hopefully will never be about discrimination against millions of citizens just because they have different sexual preferences. There is no reason that gays shouldn't be allowed to marry, you can't use religion to base your argument, remember separation of church and state? The state isn't supposed to cater to any one religion nor pass any laws in their favor nor against them, so this amendment if based on the religious ideaology that it is wrong would be wrong itself.  So I URGE you to sign  urlLink this petition  to help in the fight, if you cannot call your senator at least sign the petition... Let's show Bush what he stirred up! Oh yeah, I got this email from PFAW...  Here and Now We Make Our Stand Against the So-Called "Federal Marriage Amendment"     The moment has arrived. Republican Senate leaders are going to try to force a vote on their discriminatory, anti-family constitutional amendment as early as this Wednesday, July 14th.  The numbers tell the story.   1 President: Trying to score political points. 1,000,000's of Americans: Targeted for discrimination. 1,000 or more rights: Forever denied to these Americans. 67 senators: Needed to pass the amendment. 2 phone calls: What you can do right now. (202) 224-6221: Sen. Levin's phone number. (202) 224-4822: Sen. Stabenow's phone number.   From the beginning of the Save Our Constitution campaign in February, our message hasn't changed and our conviction hasn't wavered. Discrimination - against gay and lesbian couples, against any individual or group of people - does not belong in our Constitution. Please send that message to your senators at least once more with a phone call to each today.  Let us know that your senators heard from you with a quick call report:  http://www.pfaw.org/go/callreport/  It's not too late to urge your friends and family to speak out, so please forward this alert to them. If they live in your state, tell them to call the senators above. If they don't, point them to our web site where they can find phone numbers for their senators and all our campaign materials.  http://www.pfaw.org/go/Senate_call_list  Until now, despite the amazing work across the progressive community, Radical Right activists have been out-calling and out-writing us on the grassroots level. We need to make our voices heard. Senate leaders are taking the extraordinary step of bringing the amendment directly to the floor without waiting for a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee. This desperate maneuvering is further proof that these truths - stated loudly and repeated often - are our best, most effective weapon:  There is no "moderate" way to write discrimination into the Constitution.   There is no "respectful" way to amend the Constitution to permanently assign one group of Americans to second-class citizenship.   There is no "compassionate" way to deny the children of gay parents the stability and legal protections that can only be offered by marriage.  As circumstances dictate, we may send you urgent action updates over the coming days. But please don't wait to call your senators. There won't be any time-outs, second chances or do-overs. Stop this discriminatory amendment in the Senate.  Thank you for all your hard work! It's truly invaluable and makes a huge difference.   Notice the bolding? Read it and weep...

      I've been at Josh's since Saturday, we didn't really do much... We never do... His cousins and their fiances were over Saturday, we just hung out and played cards with them, it was pretty fun... Josh's cousins are cool, Amy and Carin, they like to party and have fun so they're cool with me! Then on Sunday we were going to the beach with his cousins, but since I still can't get any lake water in my nose we didn't go. I would've been more than happy to go anyway, I didn't have to swim, just being on the beach rocks to me. They ended up staying there the whole day until like 11 at night so I would've seen that sunset! I'm really sorry that I missed it, I love sunsets and a sunset over Lake Michigan is one not to be missed if you get a chance to see it. Well today I left Josh's at about twelve since I am supposed to clean the basement today I had to come home... But you know what? I'm not going to do it! HA! Honestly though I don't really feel good today to do anything like that I just want to go back to sleep, my back hurts and my head is pounding again! So right now I'm probably going to go lie down for a while or something so I'll post much more later...

      I just woke up and its freakin' 4:00 man lol I sleep way too much! Oh well I feel better today, no insane thoughts anymore! I still have no clue what that was all about yesterday it was an odd, odd feeling but it's over now so maybe I'm not as crazy as I think I am... Anyway Courtney is off to Illinois I don't know when she'll be back, I think she went to see her brother before he moves along with her dad so it kinda sucks without her I'm even more bored! I could call her cell I suppose but right now I really should take a shower, I think I will right after this post and maybe drink some good old java to get me going because right now I could go back to bed again... Man I love the summer life! It's so fun! Well, not really, but at least I get sufficent sleep most of the time... My sister is supposed to call me here pretty soon, she wants to go see a movie and then talk about the concert in August which reminds me, me and Josh, possibly his cousin too, are going to see Evanescence and Three Days Grace in Ohio hopefully it works out because TDG rocks! Josh has become like obsessed with them like I am with Simple Plan, I do have to admit though the lead singer is HOT! I'm trying to stick with half way decent grammar and capitalization from now on with my blog, because I'm not learning anything by doing it. I might as well practice up on some English while I'm blabbering about junk that no one even really cares about...

      Well, I bleached my hair today… Results: Not what I wanted at all but not that bad either, it’s like a chestnut brown with a few black spots, other than the spots I like the color… My mom said she would buy another bleach kit tomorrow so I could do it again but I don’t want her to because my hair is really dry right now from the first bleaching so I might wait a few weeks or something… Now that I look at it, my hair seems to have a red tint to it so that’s actually kind of cool. Today was pretty boring for the most part I woke up super late, around 2 or so. By the time I got out of the shower and shaved it was 2:30 so I pretty much wasted my day, I was supposed to mow today for Jeanne but it looked like rain all day and I didn’t want to get caught in the rain mowing, its not very fun! So that’s on my list tomorrow. I think I might actually clean my basement tomorrow too, it’s pretty bad! I’ll have to show you on cam or something if you want… I watched the movie Monster today, it was an awesome movie. I had to finish it after I caught 10 minutes of it with my parents so I brought it downstairs and popped it in, let me tell you WOW that was a really good movie! It’s about this hooker that gets raped and becomes a serial killer with this other girl that is gay and they fall in love. Towards the end I cried, yeah big surprise! It was really sad at the end you must see it! If you want to borrow it just hit me up and I’ll let you borrow it. I still need to watch The Last Samurai and Cold Mountain before week’s end so that way I’m caught up on all of the new movies my mom has bought in the past months. My allergies are killing me yet again, but I looked on the calendar today and I only have a week left until I see Dr. McTigue about getting something to take care of them. At least I have nasal drainage now, before it just ran out the front and nothing could drain in the back so that’s a good thing. I didn’t really sleep last night until about 8 this morning so that’s probably why I slept so late and all, I just kept sneezing and my sinuses were killing me so I couldn’t get comfortable the whole time I lied there. Eventually though I fell fast asleep and it felt great! Well I’m starting AIM and Yahoo so I better go before I get too swamped and forget to publish… Oh and one more thing, if you get a chance pick up the Something Corporate CD it’s soft but a very good listen!

      today has been hell for my allergies they are like non stop! grr i guess the doc was wrong i do have allergies, o well i go back in 2 weeks to get some meds for it, hopefully something will work this time around... well it's official i screwed yet another good thing up w/ eric but idk the whole thing i was confused about it and i guess ive made my decision... to end it i guess, nothing i can do now to make it right so i guess its not going to happen... i miss brian already lol he always made me laugh! o well he'll be back this weekend... you know what i wish would just end? the whole thing with chad... emma brought it up today by accident of course but whenever i hear anything about him i just keep thinking about the day we met and how i fucked it up, i know how i did it and everyone else does too... it doesnt hurt as much anymore like it used to so thats good... as long as i dont hear his name or the name chad at all i dont ever think about the things w/ him and stuff but when i do its like a never ending thing you know.. he was my first bf and probably my last for a while since brian is taken... i want to be able to just stop thinking about chad and think about brian instead, i guess that'll happen in time i just have to wait and keep myself occupied in the mean time... well today has been a shitty day with the allergies and all then thinking about you know who again! grrr GET OUT OF MY HEAD! i just wanna forget about it and feel better for once!

I feel like going on a run or something like that, I can't run good at all though :( so maybe I'll just go for a walk somewhere... Possibly town? I don't know maybe I'll call Courtney and see what's up, we could do something maybe I don't know.... Well I'm really bored to sum things up for today, I haven't really done anything too interesting, but you know what? It's all good because I got Simple Plan blaring in my ears right now, nothing gets better than this!

      Geez it's been a while eh? I haven't really had the motivation or the thought to post in the past few days. So sorry about that I know you all like reading my boring life for some odd reason... Well anyway I went to Courtney's yesterday and Melissa ended up riding her bike over to her house so we all hung out since her computer needs a new CDROM I couldn't put XP on it. We ended up putting in the Simple Plan DVD and watching part of that until Melissa had to leave... It was so funny, me and Courtney sang like every word of the DVD and when Melissa would know the words she would too. Then when Pierre came out in his undies Melissa is like is it folded up? It was so funny, then Courtney says yeah it has to be or it would be flopping out. Man that would be hot if it did that! Then we watched the music videos on the DVD so of course we started to sing along with them. When "Perfect" came on we all started singing so I recorded it on my cell it was so cool! We sang the whole thing "I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you, but you dont understand." man I LOVE THAT SONG! Then when I got home I ended up mowing the lawn some more, which I have to finish today after laundry gets done. Then I got online and talked to some people... Well the person that I wanted to get online did, you know who you are ;), then we talked and well lets just say things are closer now... :D So now today I am going to the Fair with Melissa and Courtney around four so that will be a good time, I'm going to ride a big scary ride I think, even though I'm a chicken!

      Today Melissa, Dennis, and I all went to Hot Topic. They had me up at about 9 this morning and ended up kidnapping me around 10. So we first went to the bank to cash my check that my mom wrote me since she didn't have any cash while Dennis went and cashed his work check. So after we were done at the banks we were off to the mall... We got down in Indiana and decided to stop for some food at Steak & Shake, I ended up getting a Side-By-Side Vanilla and Chocolate shake with a mushroom swiss burger. It was a great breakfast! Then afterwards I put on Melissa's Tinkerbell necklace, it was soooo pretty! It has like these crystal wings on it soooooo pretty I tell you! So then we went to the mall and entered through the Marshall Field's entrance. We saw the escalators and rode them because they are really fun but when we got up to the second story the down escalator was broken so we rode the elevator down, not as much fun! So then we were off to Hot Topic of course, lucky us my and I think Melissa's favorite guy was working there, Nick! He is such a cutie and he is pretty funny too! So we were looking around and he came up to us asked if we were doing fine and such then when he was walking away he was aparently checking me out, Melissa said he was looking at my ass and doing a rubber neck at me, I was like OMG NO WAY! So then one of the girls that works there showed up, Melissa went up and started talking about how me and her both think Nick is really hot and all then she went up to him and talked to him for a bit while me and Melissa browsed some more. So then I find these earrings and rubber bracelets that I want so I go to check out and Nick is looking hot as usual and he asked how old we were and Melissa said we're Juniors and she said he had a disappointed look in his eyes so thats kinda cool I suppose. Then we were talking about DUHS and stuff, he said that our school is actually a nice school as far as looks go since he performed all the time in the SMC choir. He goes to WMU now though so that means I wont be able to see him perform or anything *sad face*. So then we went over to Spencer's and talked about how hot Nick was and all then we ended up leaving and going back to my place. So I introduced Melissa to my parents and then we looked for the cat but we couldn't find him for the life of us so then she left and I just sat around for the most part. Then my mom told me to get off the phone so she could call Centennial about a cell phone plan. So she calls them and finds out that they have a good deal going on and we headed into town to go get some phones. We ended up getting 3 Sony Ericsson T226's and 600 anytime minutes, free mobil to mobil, free nights and weekends, and free long distance to anywhere in the US along with all your nonsense like caller ID and such. So now my cell is super spiffy! You can call it anytime you want since Incoming is free and it's a local call for around here... The number is (269) 462-0425. Well I guess that I don't really feel like continuing the last night's post so I'm done hit me up if you want to!

      I just got home from the Reunion about 4 hours ago... It was one to remember! We left Friday morning around 7 and stopped over in Schoolcraft to get some chow at MarJo's west, let me tell you, wow, they have REALLY good food! Then with a full stomach and back in the motorhome I was off to sleep while listening to Simple Plan set on repeat. I managed to get in about 2 hours of sleep since I had only slept 2 hours Thursday night it felt really good to get some more sleep. So anyway we arrived at the campground around 1pm or so, I helped Marie and my dad set up the camp and then waited for Addie so we could chill. I hadn't seen her in ages so it was great to see her again, she's still the same old Addie, all jiggalette(sp?) and stuff. She brought her friend Kelsie from the lakes so we all chilled and got everything set up like the tents and such. Then I told them I was gay and they were all like wicked awesome! So that went over well with them, I knew that it would be fine with them since they both know what it's like to be discriminated or hated on... So then we went for a swim that lasted about an hour or two even though the water was freezing we still had to go see our old pals, the buyos (sp?) just kidding but yeah we always have a tradition of hanging out by them and trying to stand on them and such. So after we get out we made our way to the swings. I love swinging, it's like soothing to me, I've always loved it. So anyway our cousin Tyler showed up with his friend from last year, Kevin (he's CUTE!), and we started chillin. Then they left and this guy comes up with one of my girl cousins, he was really cute and I told Addie and Kelsie that he was hot. I figured he was my cousin's boyfriend but then I heard him talk and I was like YEAH HES GAY! He was also listening to Maroon 5 on a little radio thing so I walked up to him and said good music and started talking to him, his name was CJ. I told him I was gay and he's like cool I am too! Then my dad was yelling for me so me and the gang (Addie and Kelsie) ran back to camp to see what was up, pizza was there. That's right we ordered pizza, none of us wanted to cook after a long ass ride, we just wanted some good food that we didn't have to cook or anything like that. It was some greasy ass pizza so I ended up eating have a slice and then felt sick from all the grease so I gave up on the pizza thing and just grabbed a pop and took of with the gang yet again. We just went to the beach and by the time we got there my cousin Tyler's friend Kyle was there and we all went for a walk while Addie snuck a cig, then it started to rain so we ended back in the tent chillin to some music. When it stopped it was dark so we all sat by the lake on a picnic table until about 3am then went back to camp to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. The next day I woke up around 6 since I wasn't going to sleep anymore with people up and moving already so I got up stoked the fire up and then grabbed the shower bag and walked up to the showers to wash the previous day's grime. By the time I was done with all that everyone else in the camp was up and moving, my dad started to cook breakfast when I seen CJ he came over and we talked about music but then my cousin took him away so they could eat. So after breakfast Addie and Kelsie were still sleeping so I helped Marie put up this shitty canopy thing that kept falling over but we got it up and we were proud of it! When the wind came about it came close to collapsing! So then I chilled around camp and the beach for a while until Addie got up at about 12. After she got up we had some Goober sandwiches and then a Josh special (roast beef and salami) over the fire. By the time we got around to doing anything it was dinner time already so we went and ate at the big buffet style Rohdy dinner, it was good I had a piece of chicken and some taco salad along with dirt cake. I was pretty much stuffed. So then we found Tyler, Kyle, and Kevin and got them all in the lake to swim. Then CJ joined us and he kept like getting close to me it was great! So then we got out and we went our ways until after the auction was over... So then we all went to Addies campfire and chilled there for a few hours... Then I got to talking to McKenzie (sister) and she said I'm going to hook you up with some alcohol if mom says yes so I asked her she said yeah because she would rather me do it there where she knows I'm safe. So she fixed me a drink that was half of a pepsi in a can with the other half vodka, so I took it back and bragged it up, chugged it down didn't feel anything, then I had her make another one and took a few hard lemonades and drank all them real fast. I ended up being smashed! So we were all just like chillin in the grass so I lied down and CJ lied down right next to me and started playing with my hair and we were all like cuddling and stuff he told me you know I could take advantage of you right now but I'm not like that. So yeah it was really really sweet! Even though I couldn't enjoy it as much since I was hammered it still wowed me. We all chilled there till like 4am then went to camp and I ended up staying up for another 2 hours and then hit the bed for about 2 hours. When we got up we had a Rohdy breakfast and me and my sister booked out of there goign about 90 lol it was fun! Well, there's alot more to talk about so I'll do it later I can't feel my fingers anymore!
