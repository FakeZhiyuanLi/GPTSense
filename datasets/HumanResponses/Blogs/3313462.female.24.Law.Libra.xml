      I loved  urlLink Rocco  before he was on network television.  I loved him back when he was the better half of a little known Food Network show with Kat Kora.       Now my beloved Rocco can't even go in his own restaurant.   urlLink Rocco has been BANNED from Rocco's.    He should have hired me as a his investor/lawyer.  Sure Rocco was being sloppy, but I wouldn't have screwed him like Jeffrey Chodorow did and I wouldn't have ever made Mama cry!

      Instead of doing research on serial killers this afternoon, I went bargain hunting at the local Goodwill. What did I find? My very own escargot dish by EMILE HENRY for only $1. Would anyone like to join me for dinner?

      The Coppenhagen Deli on El Camino in Santa Clara claims to be a Danish Deli.  It's taken me a year to actually try it because as a good Danish girl (where else do you think my blond hair and giant breasts came from?), I thought I'd be sorely disappointed with the deli if it wasn't "Danish enough."  My grandparents live in a very Danish community, and I was brought up around Danish food and culture.  Finally, today I visited and I was even more disappointed than when I left the Gilroy Garlic Festival.  This Danish deli didn't have  urlLink Aebelskiver  or Rullepolse!  In fact, the lady running the place hadn't even heard of Aebelskiver!  These are bad Danes and I won't be returning.

         I love food and I love garlic.  What better way to celebrate the end of summer school than to spend a sunny afternoon eating food made with garlic.  I ate great food, but admittedly I was a bit disappointed.      Where is the creativity?  The only novel garlic item was ice cream, but even that wasn't very exciting or fun.  My scoop of garlic-chocolate couldn't compare to regular old generic brand ice cream from Safeway, and you couldn't even taste the garlic.  I did eat a garlic Jelly Bean, and let me tell you it was NASTY.      Where were the roasted bulbs of garlic?  What about deep fried garlic cloves? What Did someone forget the olive oil for Bagna Calda?  No roasted chicken with garlic cloves?   There wasn't even a decent aioli in site!    If you're looking for clever and novel garlic dishes, the Gilroy Garlic Festival is not the place for you.  If you're looking for some decent fair food and a craft show, pull out your $10 and start heading down the 101.

      It's 2:15 in the morning and I'm eating Java Chip again.  I hate Starbucks, but I can't manage to stop buying their ice cream.  This is particularly a problem now that I have a  huge stack of coupons for $1 off quarts of the devil's ice cream that don't expire until 2005.

      Tonight's midnight snack: melba toast with goat cheese and avacado.  It's delicious, as it should be considering I paid $2 for my California avocado!   Tonight's project: finish my serial killer reseach and compile the information into a tidy, easy to use grid.

      Other than being reminded of the Stepford Wives and agreeing that this is "simply archaic," I can't help but think fondly on my days at Smith College where my friends at times came to meals in no more than a towel.  We always encouraged boys to join us, however, and easily avoided law suits.    urlLink  Court rejects men-dining-nude claim Orders club to let women into restaurant    Wednesday, July 7, 2004   NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- The Louisiana Supreme Court ordered a country club to open its men-only restaurant to women, rejecting claims that members sometimes dine there in the nude.  "In the twenty-first century, it is simply archaic to cite protection of women from the sights and sounds of a locker room environment as an excuse for excluding them from the public dining area as it exists in this country club," Justice John L. Weimer wrote for the unanimous court.  Tuesday's decision upheld an appeals court ruling against Southern Trace Country Club in Shreveport.

      On my drive home this afternoon I noticed a man walking down the sidewalk.  Like I had earlier, he was eating and walking.  I felt for the walker as he rushed somewhere too busy to sit down to enjoy his dinner.  That is until he LITTERED!  Geesh!  Even if he has no time to sit to eat he certainly has time to throw his trash in a garbage can!  I honked and shook my finger at him, but I don't think he understood the message.

      I literally ate my lunch, Italian sandwich on whole wheat, while walking across campus to the law library today.  Good thing it was a sandwich because soup would have made a terrible mess on my t-shirt.   Seriously, will my lawyer life really be so busy that I won't even be able to SIT DOWN to enjoy my lunch?

      This evening on the drive home from the library I stopped at Saveway to purchase a six-pack of Newcastle.  I only wanted one; I'm supposed to be writing a faux appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the Religious Land Use and Internationalized Persons Act. It's due tomorrow, and like usual it's past midnight and I've only written three paragraphs.    Safeway never, ever, has what I'm looking for.  I go in looking for cream cheese and they will be out completely.  I make a special trip for red bell peppers and it’s the evening before the vegetable delivery; apparently its always the night before the vegetable delivery.  I don't even try for fresh basil anymore.    Tonight Safeway came through.  Their newest product: 1 pint bottles of Newcastle sold individually. I could have died happily right there in aisle 11. I'm almost sorry I ever said anything bad about Safeway (other than the comments about their inflated prices and poor treatment of workers).     So, now as I get back to my midnight snack of smoked salmon and Emmentaler (that’s Swiss cheese to you non-foodies) and Newcastle (I'm not kidding- this is my snack), I welcome you into my world beyond internet billionaires.

      His next reply:  "Let me talk to my roommate and find out. I think it is tough !  where you live ? you can have date with me if you like. i am single guy, software prof, educated. i live in sunnyvale.  reply back."  I love that he uses complete sentences and demands my reply.  I felt so sorry for this guy I almost said yes, but then I remembered I'm holding out for the ultimate educated computer professional.  I was polite in my reply, but ultimately turned him down.

      Seriously Larry  You really ought to give Quetta a chance. Not only is she a gourmet guru, but also a truly wonderful companion and friend. Maybe sometimes you get down, perhaps the other billionaires pick on you. If you would just give her a chance, I'm sure Quetta could make you feel better. She has a way of making even the worst situation feel better. She can see the silver lining in almost everything. Everyone needs someone like that in their life, Quetta could be yours. Plus, I bet she is a better kisser than Sergey.  Don't be foolish Larry! Don't miss your shot at the best thing going in the Bay Area!   urlLink Margo

I would post it, except the guy was so attractive that it would cause some of my female friends (and gay male ones) to go blind.  I'm mean, he's not as attractive as Larry of course, but he is pretty handsome.    I admit, I probed him further and sent him a picture of me.  Since I refuse to post his picture, I’ll at least show you the one I sent.

      "This takes the cake."  Well... I know this.  Thank you.  But, I don't want my Craigslist ad to take the cake; I want to take Larry and Sergey to cake. I'll even bake them a cake (and by the way, I'm a terribly good baker).  They can pick what kind of cake!  There can be two cakes!  Or four!   They can have as many cakes as they want, within reason of course.  I guess that means, maybe, ten cakes.  Yes, I could probably bake ten cakes and still be sane enough to go on a date.  Good thing Liz likes cake because if I baked ten cakes for only four of us there would certainly be a lot of cake eating on our date.  In fact, so much cake eating that it would have to be called a Cake Date.

      At about 11:00 p.m. one evening in early May I posted on Craigslist for a Date with Larry and Sergey.  I explained that I wasn't a gold-digger and wasn't looking for anything long-term.  In order to prove my intentions were honest I even offered to pay any date expenses and let them pick our destination.  Considering I am a broke grad student, I thought this was mighty generous.

      So, just how do you track down Larry and Sergey?  I tried a Google search, but that wasn't very helpful.  I used a Yahoo search too (Shhh- Don't tell).  I started asking everyone I knew if they knew someone at Google. They all answered in the negative.    What is a girl to do?  My bestfriend Phil has a nice girlfriend named Suzanne. Suzanne suggested posting on Craigslist, and that's exactly what I did.

      A date with the Google guys? Apparently she had seen them on ABC.  I had never thought much about them, but figured I had scored plenty of dates with other computer geeks. What made these two so different?  I asked my law school buddies if they knew anyone at Google because I needed a date with Larry and Sergey.  Do you know what they did?  They giggled and told me to keep dreaming.  Perhaps I should have stopped then, but being told I can't do something of course makes me want to do it even more.  Larry and Sergey became my new mission, my new hobby, my new procrastination device.

       My middleman responded:       "This is not a hoax.          I talked to Larry and Sergey about your ad, and what they like about your ad was that you were using their passion - the internet - to try and get a date with them.         I will forward your picture to them, if you like, and let us see how it goes. Knowing them though, I would say this picture is not likely to do you good. They are more likely to be interested in someone who was either conservatively dressed - or - on the other extreme, someone bold enough to send a naughty pic.          Let me know if you still want to send this one."      A few things:     1. I have no idea if this guy was for real or not; therefore, please do not assume anything (for example: that the middleman actually knows anyone who I might want to go on a date with, that the middleman is actually a man, that Larry ever knew about my little ad or took the time out of his busy Googler schedule to make a comment to the middleman about it)!  Remember, this blog is in no way associated with Google even if the purpose of the blog is to  become  associated with people at Google.      2.   If they liked an ad on Craiglist they should freaking love a BLOG!    3.  Only a foolish man would refuse a date with hot (and brilliant) girls like Liz and me.      4.  This was the first that I told Liz about my quest for our dates.  She thought I was crazy; I demanded she send conservative pictures as soon as possible.

      It occurred to me that yesterday I compared Evan, a person I’ve never met, with three food products from the Cornhusker state.  I did not mean to imply that Evan is something edible.  My point was only to establish that many great things come out of Nebraska, including me and dough stuffed with ground beef and spices.    Liz, for you this means that you are not allowed to consume Evan on any dates whether or not he has geek-chic glasses.  Consuming Evan is against the rules.

      Hey Larry (and any of his friends), please note that I'd like to change my request.  I no longer want a date for  urlLink Liz  with Sergey.  Nope.  I think she'd much prefer a date with  urlLink Evan .  I haven't asked her yet (perhaps she'd be willing to comment for us), but knowing her type, I suspect Evan would be a much better match.  Not that Liz has a problem with Russians who do flying trapeze of course, or that she would turn Sergey down if he actually said yes, it’s just if I’m going to play cyber matchmaker I might as well attempt to put compatible folks together.   Besides, I also have Nebraska running in my veins; thus, I know that just like  urlLink Dorothy Lynch ,  urlLink Kool-aid , and  urlLink Runza , Evan must be good.

      I tried a few minutes ago "date with larry page" as a google search.  Google found nothing.  I tried the same as a yahoo and lycos search and both engines found my page.  Why is Pagerank failing me?  There are even links to my page with the right words!!!  That Googlebot and I are going to have to have a little chat.

      Well, that's it kids.  That's the little story of me trying to get a date with Larry and Sergey.  Liz has come and gone.  I've moved.  It's time to end my quest.   Don't be sad.  It hasn't been completely fruitless. Some positive things that have come from the Larry Blog: 1. I can blog with the best of them. 2. Endless hours of amusement for my friends. 3. I danced with Orkut, and let me tell you, he is quite the dancer.  4. I know to avoid most people from Criaglist. 5. Now I know all sorts of things about search engines that I didn't know before.   That said, from now on this blog will only reveal actual Googler sightings.   Until then.... good luck with that IPO.

      The last responder wrote one last e-mail.  "Yeah, it is unfortunate yet not surprising!  I am sure you will meet some quality men as you know how to speak your mind.  Keep up the "good" work .. hehe."  I'm not sure what this good work is.   Speak my mind?  Oh dear, if only he knew the truth.

      "Thanks for your help.  I've actually received quite a bit of information, and apparently they have heard about my request (and unfortunately, though not surprising, have turned us down).  I'm certainly too busy to be running around trying to set up accidental meetings, whether or not they'd be successful.   Perhaps I'll run into one of them someday, but I'm not holding my breath.   Incidentally, I love that you responded to me using GMail.   Thanks again!"  I'm too busy to be blogging too.  Aren't we to the end yet?
