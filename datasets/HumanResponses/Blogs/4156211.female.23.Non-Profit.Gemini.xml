       phew.      it's been a really packed week for me. but along the way, wow, i've had so much fun and been so encouraged! although my eye bags do seem to have expanded... =b   (time to invest in more concealer. eeps!)      well,   national day   was a blast! it was the first time i've really enjoyed my national day. used to be i'd just stay home and lie around like a lumpy couch potato-ey... but this time round, ngam* and some other friends had a fantabulous afternoon of cutting, glueing, pasting and painting some four banners into existence. well, actually 3 banners and one giant wand =)       there was a considerable amount of munching going on as well. heh heh... on   yummy juicy brazilian apples   (from Cold Storage - trust me, they're the best apples you can get!)      anyways, all the cool artsy stuff we made was part of our ra-ra props for   Singapore Idol  . =D yup, our friend JD is pretty far in the competition, and we went down this week for one of the pre-recorded shows to  ROAR  our support! =)      Can't give the details yet, but it was awesome to step inside a television studio. it was a lot smaller than i expected (although it apparently seats 800 pax), and not quite so fancy as i'd thought. but it was cool enough lah. heh...       we got our own screen time to  SCREAM  our adoration and declaration of unending support. heh heh... i think we pretty much lambasted the rest of the audience into oblivion. haha... ok, maybe that's wrong use of 'lambast', but i always did want to use the word. =b so yeah, i'm pretty proud of our yelling prowess.      HAH!       JD was gorgeous (as usual), but the judges were horrible. oh well, but i shall refrain from that strain of thought, because i guess, in the end, at least some of what they say might be scripted etc... who am i to judge etc... so, yeah. but i did feel they could have been a LOT kinder...       =)       other than that, the other highlight of my week was baby-sitting the Andersen kids. =) Mike Andersen (from the U.S.) is on STINT with CCC, so he brought his whole family with him! FOUR KIDS?!?!?!?! =D      they are really   really   cute, all blond hair  blue  eyes cheeky grins sticky fingers. 3 boys and a girl, and she's totally endearing and not the least bit shy!      i was pretty scared that i wouldn't be able to connect with the boys, who are pretty mature for their age and not very interested in typical-Singapore-boy-stuff like toy car racing and lego. but they were really sweet and friendly in the end. although they didn't really eat much of the pizza...      brought them out for 'popsicles' (ice creams) after that. i tell you, it was super traumatising to take 4 kids across a 2-way road! i was holding on to the two youngest and directing the other two to go first, but still, was realyl gritting my teeth hoping no motorbike would suddenly zoom around the corner and dash them into smithereens! but thank God we made it to Cold Storage safely.   hoo-boy...      everyone got a cornetto, except little nicole, whow anted her  jellipop . it's this ice cream stick (paddlepop) that has a piece of jelly right in the middle. anyways, on the way back, her lovely jelly slid right out onto the grass. =( she was so woebegone and disappointed, but i didn't think i should buy her another ice cream... (too much sugar no good hor...) so tried to cheer her up somewhat.       and cheer up she did, when i brought them to the playground after that. it's really cool how agile and daring the kids are, clambering up and slide and shinnying along the monkey bar like they spend the whole day doing this (hmmm... i guess they've hada fair amount of practice!) had a very funny LOTR conversation with kevin too. we both agree on one thing at least -  aragorn is MACHO!  heh heh... i dun understand why  ON EARTH?!?!?  matthew wants to be gimlee though... go figure      the very LAST exciting thing that happened to me (well actually a series of exciting things that have led to an exciting conclusion!) is that i have just raised my full support!!! =) i'm so SOOOO dazed by God's overwhelming and timely providence! in fact, after the two letters i received in the mail tonight, i've actually raised MORE than i need. praise God!        Jesus you are so good!

        today has been   pretty   amazing .         but before i can explain why i am so happy, i guess some background info is in order... well, i guess i just wanna share my story with whoever reads this page lah! =D      some of my friends would know that i am currently embarking on a one-year stint (short-term internship) with  ForeRunner , the music ministry of Singapore Campus Crusade for Christ.       it's not an impulsive decision on my part. in fact, it's probably one of the most major decisions i've ever made in my life! but i haven't had a moment of regret yet =)      the last few months of my final year, i was really agonizing over what to do with my life after graduation?!?!?       i was reminded of the promise i had made God when i was in Japan back in 2001 - that i would go  anywhere  He calls me to, and give my life to tell people about   His unconditional love and forgiveness .        (at the time, i was rather simplistic in my faith. i didn't literally mean 'give my life' for example, i had a whole bunch of conditions attached. like - i want to be attached, i want to have a whopper of a burning-bush-style calling etc etc...)      over the next few years, i guess i grew kind of  disillusioned . about missions, about Christian life, even about God! this was a result of a combination of the stuff i was studying that really made me question the reality of God, and the 'withdrawal' effect of coming back to the normal realm after a very spiritually-high mission trip.      i really thank God for wonderful friends and mentors who stood by me and encouraged me.        so these past few months, even as i went to thailand for a music missions trip, i was still quite undecided about what to do with my life. but through several friends i made whom i was privileged to share my dreams, fears and ambitions with, i was reassured that   this desire to use my life to bring His love to others is in itself a gift of God .        and through one particularly tiring day of concerts, God used the words of the song  "Forgiven"  to impress upon me the deep need that so many youth have for the knowledge that they are free from the chains of past sins and self-blame, unmet expectations and failed projects. they need to know, they need to see - that Jesus paid the price to set them  free !      so here i am, waiting for the rest of my life to unfold . well, at least this next year. after that,  i'll see where He leads me to be.      it's   exciting  . but it's pretty   scary   too. especially the prospect of raising my monthly support. =b      but through it all, the past few weeks especially, God has simply been amazing. yes, there are low periods, when it feels  unbrearably lonely to  be the only one of my peers who is embarking on this particular trail... and when i feel scared about what the future holds. but there are great times too, when i see God's hand so undeniably at work in my life and the lives of people around me. and when i look at the stars or at a falling leaf, and remember that, whatever happens,  we can handle it together  - me and my God - the Lord of heaven and earth!      so i'm really happy today because i was feeling pretty worried about my support the past week. and today, a friend gave me a really generous gift! it's really a heaven-sent blessing to me, because i think God wanted to encourage me through this person, and i truly am!       it's like... i am just a small child in His hand, and for a while, He put me behind His back so i couldn't see what He was doing, and so i got anxious and worried, but now He's brought His hand back to the front again so i can see what wonderful things He has done! and all this while,  i've been lovingly held in the palm of His hand .      wow. i just realised this is a really long post. =b better stop here.
