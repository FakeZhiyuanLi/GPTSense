       urlLink    Jade : One day, when I was young, my Dad brought home a guitar.  I was quite intrigued and went to pick it up but he said,  "Son, unless you can wail on that thing like Nuno Bettencourt  from Extreme or maybe Steve Vai when he was playing with David  Lee Roth and he had the sweet double-necked guitar that was like two legs coming out of a heart, keep your damn hands off it!"  And I never touched a guitar again. So to answer your question, yes, I answer the phone whether it rings or not. &nbsp; urlLink

      " It's nothing ." you say and pull your arm away from me. I can see the blood beginning to seep through the fresh bandages that cover a large part of your arm. and I know I don't really need to ask but I do because it's easier to pretend .  " You're bleeding. What happened ?"  You sigh and roll your eyes because we've gone through this so many times its becoming monotonous.  " It's just a scratch, nothing to worry about."  That's what you say anytime you want me to drop the subject . We both know that it doesn't really matter because I won't and you'll keep trying to evade the question. trying to feed me half-truths. you tell me it's for my own good. it won't do me any good to worry about you. finally after a couple of minutes of being questioned you let me look at your arm. and it's covered with red angry cuts that criss-cross and seem to go on forever. some have stopped bleeding but others are still seeping. for a minute I say nothing. then I meet your eyes, and you're smiling so I smile back. " I'll get some fresh bandages." and i'm out of the room before you can say anything.

      I might drown in your eyes. In the light that they hold. get caught in the sweetness of the words that you speak. your lips touching mine until  your breath is all I can taste. I might die of thirst . If I can't have your kiss. though your words could be poison. yet taste sweet through your breath. that it would not matter if you brought on my death .

      Behind closed lids explosions of colors. blue , pink , green . lips that sometimes are sweet. sometimes  taste of nothing. dry, bleeding , tasting me. cold.  ' What are you thinking ? ' whispered close to my ear. breath so warm. close. raising  tiny goosebumps along my arms.  Behind closed lids you are a million different sensations. sometimes soft  and warm , feather-soft touches. other times pain. I hold my hands up to your face. hold my arms. can you  see them ? can you ? feel them ? some are you'rs ... and I really don't remember which ones anymore.  and they never really hurt ...I wanted them to hurt. look closer. yes, that's it. you see them. look. do you want  to know.  ' How did ...' you begin but never really finish the question . I didn't expect you to. and so instead  I let you bury your head in my arms. stroke your hair. hear you whispering something. soft, under your breath.  can't make out the words. close my eyes. wonder if I can make the tears come. maybe ? maybe not. but it  doesn't really matter. you're looking at me now. I can feel your eyes on me. open my eyes. stare. smile.  ' What are you thinking ' you ask . eyes so dark they threaten to drown me. ' Nothing ' words forming on my lips. coming out of my mouth. even before I can stop myself. ' Nothing '

      Your lips are soft against mine. they move slowly and leave a trail of wetness behind. and even after you pull away i can still taste you. a mix of cigarette smoke and beer. you lean back in your chair and watch me with an amused look in your eyes. like you're waiting to see what i'll do. and seeing how i'm not one to dissapoint -- i lean into you until your lips are touching mine .it's always soft at first. lips barely moving against each other. almost like neither one of us really wants it to end too quickly. i feel your tongue brush my lower lip . sigh. but not sure if it came from me or you. and it's not like it really matters right now.  Feel your fingers against the side of my face. moving slowly until they are tangled in my hair . and it's beautiful. what you make me feel. I melt beneath your touch. and your kiss is fire and something else that i can't really describe. soon your tongue is inside my mouth. but all i can really think about is how incredibly soft your lips are.

      your hands are always so cold . like you've been out in the middle of winter without your gloves on. that's why I hold onto them so tightly . or at least that's what I tell myself . you barely notice all the time that has gone by since we last saw each other . you smile and wrap your arms around me . and I'm surprised to discover that you still smell like peppermint and smoke . I smile too . maybe I'm more surprised by the realization that I still remember what you smell like . smile . your lips feel so warm against my cheek . you press harder into me and I realize you've been saying something this whole time . "come with me" I hear you say close to my ear . and my stomach wants to drop down to my knees . I hate that after 3 years you can still affect me so very much . I hate myself more for letting you . or maybe I hate myself for letting you go in the first place . your hands are always so cold . I rub them between my own trying to warm them for you. I tell myself that's the only reason I still haven't let go . that's the only reason I seem unable to let go .

      HE'S MARRIED . and I'm the last to find out . I can't believe none of my ' friends ' told me anything because I am sure they had to know something about this. now , I realize how idiotic it is of me to get pissed about this . I mean it's not like I expected him never to get married but ...still ..I feel like picking up the phone and calling him up and telling him to come over . like that would happen. should this hurt this much ?

      You'll never reach me. I'll fall before you touch me . feel your fingers against my wrist . pick me up from the floor. I've left my blood on your bathroom tiles.

      It burns against my skin. sometimes it slices through with such ease that i don’t even feel the bite of the blade.  cut. spill against my skin.

      We were laughing about something silly I said. that’s how it started. you teased me about my laugh. pointed out that when I laughed I always wrinkled my nose . felt you move closer and didn’t think anything about it. or maybe I did and didn’t care about anything other then how much fun it was being with you.

      ' don't go' he says and i can feel his fingers tighten around my wrist. we stay like that for a few seconds. me staring down at his hand trying desperately to remember why i want to leave. he watches me - fingers slowly releasing their grip . i look at him now.' don't go ' whispered so softly it might have been lost if it wasn't so unbelievably quiet . and his voice seems to have replaced his hand on my wrist because i'm still standing there. unable to move away. feeling his eyes bore into mine.

      Hold your hands in the sink. try and make sure the blood won't get on the floor. because I really hate cleaning blood. or maybe it's just the cleaning that I hate. I watch it slide down your fingers and splatter in the sink. red against white. and all I can think about is the mirror and how I'm going to have to explain it to them.  catch you staring at me. and you're smiling at me. turn the water on . to try and wash the blood off your hands. hear you wince from the pain but you say nothing and so I continue with my task. after a few minutes I finally turn the water off and wrap your hands in a towel. all most immediately the blood begans to soak through. I mention we should go to the hospital. you'll need stitches but you shake your head and tell me not to worry.  " Can I have an aspiring, though ?" . Place them inside your mouth and hold the glass of water against your lips. find myself facinated by the water that's dripping down your chin. sit down on the couch and stare . I can tell you want to say something but you seem to be struggling with how to put it. finally your eyes rest on my face and you say in that soft voice of your's that I've come to love. " I promise to replace the mirror "

      there are always words sparkling just above the surface . spreading above me like stars. burning bright in my mind and disappearing before I can string them together for you .there are always words I want to say to you. thoughts and ideas I don't seem to be able to express properly . there is always a lack of words when you are around -- never quite right for what I'm trying to say . and you are always there . sometimes barely brushing the edges of my thoughts . other times consuming me . and you are always there . making me wonder why I ever believed I could capture with words what you mean to me . there are always words .
