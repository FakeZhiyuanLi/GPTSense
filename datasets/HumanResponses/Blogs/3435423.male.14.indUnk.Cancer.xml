      Well tonight I get to have a cookout. We have beef, chicken, salmon, and a bunch of nasty vegetables. Anyway my friend went back to his house to get some cooking utensil(he lives like 10 min away). So anyway, I figured out how to copy DVD's, so I'm never gunna have to buy another DVD. I'll just rent it then copy it! What a great world we live in! Ok well that's all I have for today. lata playa

      Sorry I missed yesterday, I was with my buddies. Well I had a game today and we won! Afterward I went to Target and got Julian his present. Tomorrow I get to go to his lakehouse and go tubing. It's gunna be badass! I bought him MVP Baseball 2004. Well before that Eric and I played a ferocious game of nutball. I got to throw a tennis ball at his balls! IT WAS A FUCKING HALARIOUS! Well anyway right now I'm being bored and waiting for someone to talk to me on IM. Well I'm done for now. See you later. lata playa

      Well I just got back from my baseball game. We won 11-3, I got pegged :). Jackson was over earlier. We didn't do anything fun except fuck with the CKS teachers. We played worms for a little bit. It was quite uneventful. Some kid is telling me about how I fuck my dad every night. I dunno if this is a cruel joke or if hes just being gay, either way I'm gunna beat the shit out of him whenever I find out who he is....gbreadman1234567 is who he is. I'll murder him if I find out who it is. I'm gunna go now, lata playa

      Well today I woke up and mowed the lawn, something I just get pure ecstasy out of. Well after I was done with that I called Maruf so he could come over. When he got here we were wondering what to do. So I suggested we take the bus to Green Hills. About 200 feet away from my house we decided we didn't really want to walk that far. :) So we hung out and played GTA 3 till my mom got home, then we went to Tower to rent 2 movies.....Paycheck and The Last Samurai. Well go figure that when we tried to watch them, neither of them worked. So now here we are...Writing my "blog." He starts to tell me how he has the same computer study guide my sister does but that his has colors and pictures on it. So then he randomly starts choking me and yelling "IT HAS COLOR DAMNIT." It was damn funny. Well that wraps it up. That's everything I did today, in such a short amount of writing. It's funny how it takes 12 hours to go from midnight to noon but it takes 20 minutes to write those 12 hours down. lata playa

      Well isn't this beautiful! I resorted to a common internet journal. Wonder if this is ever read by anyone? Well, yesterday I spent the night at Julian's house.So when I woke up I was at Julian's house, then when he had to go to Ariel's(stupid jew), I went to Eric's(these are all kids on my baseball team). It is one hard mother fucking walk from Julian's to Eric's. "Smell My Cock?" HAHA, that was halarious! Too much man love! Well my mom is being gay, like always, so I gotta leave this at this. lata playa

      Racheal was right, I am a huge bitch. I don't take criticism well and if someone makes me mad, I retaliate in the wrong way. So I'm sorry for anything I did to anyone. lata playa

      Well I'm in St. Louis! Everyone is asleep so I thought it would be OK for me to write in my "blog". Well my cousin is obsessed with lighting fireworks and I'm afraid he's gunna get us in trouble. My other cousin is a little girl that fakes that she can't breath when she falls over. Then my other cousin is pretty normal, she is sane sibling. We're all going to Six Flags on Thursday! Yes, yes, I know, you all want to go. Well I guess I'll just write again when I get back. lata playa

      Well today I got up at 12:00, then I went downstairs and did nothing. Then until 3, I did nothing. Then I rode down to tower with cade. A very tedious ride, I might add. We rented Memento and The Bourne Identity. They were like the same thing except memento was twice as good. Anyway, that's all I did so I'll write more stuff later. lata playa

      Yeah well today I broke my wrist. I was riding down a hill on my bike, and I took a sharp turn and the bike flew out under me, and I flipped and landed on my wrist. After that I went to dinner with my sister cause shes going away for a month. Then after that, I went to see chronicles of riddick with cade. It was pretty cool, but the first one was better. Other than that, nothing happened. So that means goodbye. lata playa

      Well today our baseball game had a weirdass ending. So the guy hit the ball to me, and it hit the third base bag and popped into foul teriorry. So I picked it up and thought it was foul, my coach yelled it wasn't so I threw it to first. I made it to first but the guy beat the throw, so then for some reason he started to run to second. We got him in a pickle and he ended up making it to second, but then for some strange gay reason he went towards third and decides he wants to stay at second, so he goes back and gets tagged out. So then he yells at the ump, "He fucking missed!" So then the ump kicks him out of the game and his mom starts yelling about how that was a bad move, so the umps kicks her out the game. So then she starts yelling aobut how he should just kick the whole team out....so he does. And that's ballgame. I thought that was my whole night, so I went to y cause I had time. I did my mile and a half on the treadmeal, and i started to lift weights and I was too sore cause yesterday I had worked out for 5 hours.So that was my day. lata playa

      Well today I went on an adventure! I was trying to a buy a certain pair of nike running shox only found at finish line, but my mom thought we could find a better deal elsewhere. So we went to sports seasons next to target. Turns out they don't care those kind of shox. So then we went to the bellvue mall. They don't have em either. So finally after an hour and a haf of driving, we finally go to Opry Mills, and they have exactly what I want :). So that's how my day went. Oh yeah, I worked out at the y with my new shoes. lata playa

      I went paintballing from 9 to 4 today! IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME! I have huge welts on my stomach(yes it's possible). There all red and puffy, and they hurt like shit. But it's totally worth it. I'm gunna buy my own gun, tippman 98 custom. It's not the best gun, but it's the best gun for the money. Anyway I hope to see some of my classmates. I have yet to see any of them. I've been hanging out with people in my neighboorhood. We had this block party yesterday, and these girls started haning out with us(Cade and I). They said they were gunna go swimming at like 12:00 and they wanted us to go. I had to get up at 8:30 the next day, so I said no go. So earlier today Cade calls me and says that there gunna go swimming and they want me to go with them. I was sleeping when he called and i wasn't too thrilled. I went anyway, and this bitch at the pool said that had to have swimsuits to swim. I had one and cade did too, so we got in and it was boring so we left. So here I am. That's all for today. lata playa
