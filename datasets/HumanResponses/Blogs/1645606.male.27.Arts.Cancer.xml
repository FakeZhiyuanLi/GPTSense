						   The aim is to write a short short story each time I log in. Each one written during the time I'm online, which is only a couple of hours, 3 or 4 times a week. So I think 500 words or less will do.

						   The Shovel biting the earth. Taking small mouthfuls to fill the sandbags held open by Private Walker. With each shovelful, he can't help thinking if he is digging his own grave. Blade in, pushed down with regulation boot. Push and pull away. Gentle swing. Empty into bag. Blade down and back in. He feels the rhythm of the movement. Now settled into doing the hard labour each day. He remembers the blisters and muscle ache of the first few weeks. The days marked by any amount of freshly dug earth. Nights passed in cold sweat, gun ready.  Still hadn't he volunteered? Wanted to serve his country. So no complaints. Shovel in. Bag filled. Brow of sweat wiped. A glance to the left. His rifle, standing ready. Propped up in the hole. Cleaned each night. Ready for action. He wondered when he would pull the trigger as drilled into him. Wondered if he would hesitate. They say you do. The first time. Shovel in. Perhaps tomorrow the whole thing will be over. Maybe tomorrow he'll be able to go home. Maybe. But he knows that it wont happen that soon. Still plenty of time to kill or be killed. Bag filled. Not for the last time he wonders if this hole, like all the holes before it, will be his grave.

						   The bottle of Jack Daniel's Old No.7 Quality Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey stood waiting for him. He didn't like to drink it, but he did like the idea of drinking it. Liked the image of it. It felt cool to drink it. Just sucked in by it's advertising. By the whole drama of drinking whiskey. That's why Stacy had brought if for him. So he could pretend. Pretend he was cool. But Stacy had long since left, just the bottle remained. He poured himself two fingers, feeling stupid and not cool at all. What difference did it make how much? Why not fill the glass? Or better still drink straight from the bottle? Save on the washing up, like that mattered. The bottle was the last thing. The only thing that remained of their relationship. Everything else, the books, the Coldplay CD, even the furniture they had brought together he had given away or destroyed. He drinks the drink. He pours another, not measuring this time, but not overfilling the glass. He did not want to spill any. He drinks the drink. Once the bottle was empty, that would be that. He smiles to himself. Well, once the alcohol has worn off, at least. He has saved this bottle for last. It was the first thing she brought him. Now it would be gone, he could have a clean break. A fresh start. All that nonsense.  He pours a drink. He drinks the drink. He's beginning to think, remember at least. Stacy. It's the last thing he wants.  'Drinking makes you think.' He slurs. He likes the ridiculousness of the rhyme. Then realises that this is because he is getting drunk. And he can't stop thinking about her.  He doesn't even know how he got started on this destructive path. Why he wanted to get rid of all reminders of her. The bottle is half empty. He reaches to pour another. His fingers around the neck. But the bottle is not lifted. No drink is poured. The glass remains empty. Slowly, ever so slowly he replaces the lid. Maybe it would be okay to remember. Once in a while. Stacy's bottle of Jack D's No. 7 goes back to the cupboard, where he had pulled it this morning. The whiskey on his lips, her smile in his mind, the empty glass on the table.

						   The weight in his pocket fell heavy on him. The car was still stirring. He reached for the key, but stopped, afraid of continuing with his actions. Both hands return to be placed on the steering wheel. The proper position, ten to two. Staring straight ahead. The weight held in his right pocket of his best suit. His best suit showing it's age. His age. Worn round the bottom of the sleeves, beginning to perish under the arm. But still the best. It always had a calming effect on him. He was wearing it when he met his wife, when they married, and when he buried her. Her life watched by a suit. The suit had also seen his first day of his job. His only job. The best part of thirty years. And it had seen the last day. Made to volunteer to be fired. Sometimes it amazed him that the suit still fit him. That his body hadn't changed it's shape in all that time. A good investment then. A trip to a proper tailor, the money sweating in his hand. Being measured, the slight embarrassment at being so close. Then the wait. The first fitting. The soft caress of the material against his skin. He wore it home, his old clothes carried in a bag. The weight in his pocket nagging at him. Turn the key, get out of the car, fulfil the purpose of the journey. Gripping the wheel tighter. He glances in the rear view mirror. A tired old man, in a tired old suit looks back at him. The white shirt beginning to yellow at the edge of the collar where it met his skin and sweat. It belonged with him and his suit. But the tie! The tie was brand spanking new. A bold fuck you red. Brought just two days ago. Worn for just the second time. (The first being when he paid for the extra weight in his pocket.) The only thing out of place. The only thing that seemed right. He released the steering wheel. He hands now clammy from holding too tightly. Gently he rubbed his palms up and down on his trousers.  It's the motion that makes him smile. She would have told him to stop. He wishes he could see her, feel the touch of her lips. The decision once made, is simple. Choice finally made, he reaches for the key. It turns easily. The engine in his car dies. He releases the seatbelt. Opens the door, and steps out. The hand in the pocket now. He catches a reflection of the red of his tie. He brings the weight from it's resting place, no longer nagging, or insistent. Pressing against his head. The bullet gives him his last kiss, and a red carnation to blossom on his suit.

						   When he does speak, he speaks of things that are no longer there. He remembers dreams of conversations that he had with imaginary friends. He whispers, so quietly that you have to hold your ear right next to his mouth to catch even the merest word. People that think they know him think he never says anything at all. The silent watcher they call him. Some shun him, afraid that he's listening to them breathing. That he can hear their thoughts. He can't do this. But he does observe them, as they walk past. Watching them perform their rituals of greeting and flirting. Some guarding their words, holding hands in front of their mouths to protect the conversations from his ears. As if he even cares what those ones have to say. The people that talk openly and freely are the characters that interest him. He likes to listen to their chatter. Sometimes he even sketches them in his book. Their faces and body movements. He even draws speech bubbles for fragments of their conversations. The best time of all is when he only hears a single sentence or phrase from the people passing by. Then he can make up a whole story based on that one snippet. That tiny fragment explodes in his mind. New characters form, mouthing the strangest dreams. These scare him as well. When he flicks back into his book, he can't remember which of the words were real and which he made up. Maybe all he was doing was copying down everything. Making nothing new at all. Blindly composing words that have already been used. Drawings of grotesque faces that he doesn't recognise. Malformed bodies writhing on the white page, that should be marked return to sender. Yet when he captures them in pen and ink, they seem so real, holding the moment as he sees it. Perhaps someone is wiping the pages clean, and putting these fantastical creatures there. Or maybe once captured, the pressing between the pages of his book distorts their form. Either way, he tries not to flip backwards. Keeps the pages closed tight. Opens to a new fresh sheet each day. Hides the demons away. So he sits. Nib poised. Listening. Observing. Watching as people close themselves as they approach, watch them ignore him. Nod to the laughs, smile to the stares. Whispering cold dreams and hot nightmares. Ready to sketch you into his book and hold you there.

						   There's a woman near him wearing the same perfume as Jane always puts on. It's definitively the same one. Chanel no.5. He has a lump in his throat, he thinks he might cry. But he doesn't. The anger beating the sorrow for now. He's travelling home. Well, away from one home to his parent’s house. Moreover, he's not going back. His stuff all packed into cardboard boxes to be moved by strangers tomorrow. Sitting in a train station, halfway through his journey.  He won’t see her again. He's happy about this. In the end, she had turned out to be not a nice person at all. There was no excuse for what she did to him. Cold and calculating. However, the relationship was over. Mixed emotions. Feeling the loss of part of his heart. Finally the train arrives. Thankfully the woman and her perfume stays at the platform. Waiting for a train in the opposite direction. The carriage is quite full. He wants to sit alone. He finds some seats empty, but the opposite ones are soon filled by two girls. He looks away, out through the window, wishing he was already home. Wishing all the bad feelings had already sunk into bad memories. The two girls sitting opposite him are chatting away. Laughing, giggling, they are being chatted up by some guys passing down the aisle. They're quite young it seems to him, but most likely they are in their late teens. Maybe even twenty. One of the girls gets up from her seat, dancing with one of the guys. Someone makes a joke. The whole carriage seems to relax. He smiles. The girl in front of him catches him smiling. Maybe she thinks he smiling at her. She asks him where he's getting off. He says the name of his station. One word. It's not her stop he can tell, though she doesn't say anymore. He goes back to looking out the window. It's getting dark. The lights of peoples houses streak past. Two stops before his station the two girls get off. When he remembers back to this journey he can't really remember what either of the girls looked like. Or even what made him smile. All he now recalls is the regret of not saying more, not even asking where she was going. The regret that it was not his station.

						   Sometimes, it's all I can do not to think about the screwdriver. It sits in my toolbox. At the bottom. Under all my other tools. I should get rid of it really. It's the only thing that can incriminate me. But it's a handy screwdriver. And a shiny new one would look out of place in its stead. Of course, I've kept it well cleaned. Scrubbed it daily for a couple of weeks after the event. Remove all traces. It would be easier to get rid of it. Simply take a trip and drop it in a river. Better yet, the sea. But the worn wood handle feels good in my hand. Moulded to my grip. It's once red paint only showing through at the base, away from my fingers touch. The shaft free of rust. Amazing really. Many other of my tools have a layer of red sickness on them. But not my trusted screwdriver. It's so sharp as well. Sharper than a knife at it's flat head. I often wonder if the makers wanted to cut screws in half, rather than push them into walls. Of course, it has dulled since I brought it. But a very nice man comes round to my door once a month to sharpen things. So I get some knives sharpened, my garden shears and my trusty screwdriver. He didn't even blink when I asked him the first time to make it extra pointed. And from then on, he's always paid it special attention. I've always liked a man who takes care over his work. I was amazed how easily it slipped into the woman's body. Into the chest. The small sound as it scratched it's way past a rib. The fantastic popping of a lung. So little blood. Well at first. It just bubbled out of her mouth.  If you want to kill someone it is wonderfully, terribly, pathetically easy. As long as you don't care who your prey is. Just go somewhere you've never been before, somewhere you'll never visit again. Wear clothes brought from a charity shop. Don’t just buy one outfit, get several. Buy from different places, at different times. Then pick someone. It can be anyone. The person who doesn't put their litter in the bin. The woman smoking. The woman not smoking. Anyone. Follow them until they're alone. Plunge the screwdriver into them. Don't hesitate. Hesitation causes panic in them. Gives them the chance to scream. Just think of it like you’re putting up some shelves. Drive the screw. Then once it's done, you leave. None of this returning to the scene of your crime nonsense. That's just for the movies. Stick it in and leave. Then get rid of the clothes. And your implement of choice. Of course, I'm breaking my own rules. But a good screwdriver isn't something you should just throw away.  Besides, I've no idea when I'll need it next.

						   He hides in his room when his relatives visit. It's not that he hates them, (he tells himself over and over that he doesn't hate them) nor his he frightened of them. He just doesn't get on with them. Two generations apart, they have nothing in common. Their only topics of conversation being gardening and the failure of their aging bodies. Two subjects which either he knows nothing about, or wants to know nothing about. In the secret place in his heart, where the feelings of guilt tighten, he hates them for coming. He hates himself for hating them. He doesn't hate them. Not really. He repeats it over and over. He just sits on his bed, waiting for them to leave. Knowing that in all honesty they wont be around anywhere for much longer. But still he waits. He doesn't even say hello. They've never been close. Even when he was a child he only saw them on rare occasions. There are other relations he has never seen. He doesn’t even know their names. One side of the family fractured from the other. He knows he should embrace them. But still he hides in his room. Getting up extra early so he can be ready to close the door and want for nothing, when their car pulls up. He wonders, idly waiting on his bed, away from all the family he knows, who else hides? Hides away from people that care about them, the parts of themselves they don't like? He hopes they leave soon. He wishes that next time he could be somewhere else. Hating himself for wasting a even pretend wish on this.  He continues to wait. What else can he do?

						   He likes the way he cuts the lawn. In even stripes of opposing shades of green. No weeds to be found here. Only the lush cropped stalks of grass. He is proud of the fact his is the only garden on the whole street to have such a perfect slice of botanical heaven. Well, not that you could call it a street, he thinks, more a cul-de-sac, but it was called a street. Edgware Street. A fitting name for a suburban development on the edge of town. There's only a small turning circle at the end of the street. You have to make a difficult manoeuvre if you come down here by mistake. Use someone else’s driveway. The whole thing made more difficult by his gates. He always keeps them closed. Even when he has his car on the road. He doesn't like the idea of someone else in his drive. What if they catch the edge of his lawn in their reversing? So, he keeps them closed. He himself, only has a small car. He always gives his lawn a wide berth as he leaves his garage. His car is kept spotless. Always with a least three quarters of a tank full of petrol. He doesn't like it to go any lower than that. Not that he drives much anymore. Just to the shops and back. And once a month, best clothes on, to put flowers on his mother's grave. He keeps roses in the front garden as well. He's not sure if he truly likes roses. Certainly not as much as a well laid lawn. But they were here when he took over the house. His mother's house. His mother's roses. He could not remove them. Still he keeps them well pruned, cut back so only one or two buds appear each year. Dutifully he always cuts the first flower for his mother, the rest he leaves till it is time to prune again.  Sometimes, when a rose is nearly over, the petals fall on his lawn. A scattering of colour in the unending green.  He picks each one up, rather than mowing over them, like the rest of the street. Not all the petals are gathered that way, some will get trampled into the grass causing damage. He always looks forward to the days he mows the lawn. The peace and calm of simple motions. Up and down. Clipping the edge. Raking up. Inspecting for signs of disease. Yes, he thinks, a well kept lawn is better than a rose. A sign of a well presented person. A first impression well made. For all the people that pass by his gates. Each night and each morning, he inspects the lawn, makes sure that the gates are shut properly, if the rose petals are ready to fall.

						   She presses the pen to the page. Ink spreading, seeping into the paper. Cheap and nasty paper, she thinks. The ink blot spreading slowly, she presses harder with the pen, willing the blue ink to spread completely across the page. To spill onto her hands, onto her dress. But it was impossible. She can never get one more than a couple of centimetres wide. She sighs, and flashes the nib over the page, giving the blot rays. Turning it into a blue sun, casting cold light over her notebook. She turns the page, finding as expected, the faded blue spot from the bleeding of her first sun. She knows she shouldn't really be wasting her time like this. Knows she has to make a decision soon. Knows she can't stay much longer in the train station not catching trains. Her notebook new, brought for it's fake leather binding, rather than the quality of it's paper. She likes the way it feels in her hand, likes the way she looks when she carries it round with her. She wants to keep a journal, a day to day document of her travel. Wants to be modern day Beatnik. But the days of the beats are over. The world changed too much for that. That travelling by hitchhiking is playing with danger. But the romance of it still finds it’s way into her heart. That people she will meet, will be the people she will be friends with forever. But she recognises that dreams can easily turn into nightmares. She knows she will probably return home, unpack her bag, no one having noticed she had gone. Her pen sketching scribbled lines floating across the page. An uncontrolled Rorschach test. But she can't see the butterfly, the vase, the people kissing, or even a head split open. Just a mess of frenzy. Another train leaves without her. She presses her pen to page once more, and watches the ink blot form.

						   He wants to have a drink but knows he can’t. He's been given the task of driving this evening. Like most evenings. But he doesn't really mind. He loves his girlfriend, and being a taxi service is just part of being her boyfriend. Still, he thinks, he would like a drink. Standing in a bar with only a cranberry juice seems wrong to him. All around him people are getting drunk, having a good time. Here he stands. Out of place. Somewhat foolish. His girlfriend is here to see her friends. One of them is leaving. For what, or where to he’s not sure. He tends not to remember them individually anyway. They’ve become to him just one giggling mass.   The whiskey he had last night comes to mind. He can still taste the memory of it on his tongue. He doesn't care that much for it, but the beer had run out, and all he could offer his friends was a shot in parting. The bottle a gift from her parents. He doesn’t know why they brought it, since neither of them really drink the stuff. Except when it's there, and there's nothing else. Of course this morning he had regretted that last drink. One drink too many. He had woken with the feeling of sick plaguing his stomach. It had been used as an excuse for him not drinking tonight. So he could drive her. And her friends. He doesn’t mind. Really. The nausea had passed now. So maybe cranberry juice was the better option. For tonight at least.

						   A ripple. The stone cast. Circles expanding. Is this what you would wish for? That your life may manage to disrupt the waters surface. Just for a single moment. A moment when you feel like a king. Till you realise the water is an ocean, and you ripple will go unnoticed, go unseen. He comes here when he needs to think. The expanse of water a good listener. She has left him with much to think about. Yet to give him an answer, he waits, with only some impatience.  A ripple when only a tidal wave, a meteor strike will do. But even then the waters will finally return to calm. What difference did you make? A ripple is all. And most of us will barely make even that. The waves lapping the sand. He keeps back from the edge, keeping his shoes from getting wet. She would have her shoes off by now, splashing in the water. The beach is empty, but it is a cold day, even he has wrapped up well.   The sifting sands. The stirring memories beneath his feet. He cast his stone when he told her he loved her. Now all that's left for this moment is to watch the curve of the flight of the stone, to watch the water. Watch for the expanding circles. Perhaps it will sink without a trace. Perhaps.

						   They like to call me sensitive. They think that because I know what they’re thinking, how they're feeling, they can call me sensitive. I fucking hate that word. Sensitive. I'm anything but. I can know what you're thinking about, what you want, who you love. I can tell you your dreams, what you last ate, who you think about when you masturbate. Sensitive? I'm far more potent, far more powerful. I can rip your dreams right from your head, cut your personality from you and leave you empty. Playing the game to see if anyone even notices. All your mindless babble that you waste your thoughts on. It never fucking stops. Filling your minds with stupid worthless rubbish. And I have to hear them. All of them. Every single fucking one. Now, the noise is going to stop. In a choice between me and all of you, you lose. Every time. And you know the best thing? I don't even have to touch you. Never have to lay my hands on your revolting flesh. You disgusting eaters of the planet. I can kill you with a look. A single glance, and you're mine. Reach in and pop your brain like a bubble. But that's too easy, far too easy. Ever seen a man suffocate because he wont open his mouth to breathe? I have. I made him think he was drowning. Trapped underwater. His hand clamped over his nose and mouth. Stopping the water getting in. Stupid filthy tramp. Should never have got in my way. He squirmed before he died. I had to crush his mind in the end, his trembling and thrashing disgusting me. So look out. You think that headache will pass, that the feeling you're being watched is just paranoia? Don't look in my eyes, and keep out of my way. Because those eyes will be the last thing you see.

						   He looks at the dust settled on the blank TV screen. He means to clean it, but he only sees the dirt when he turns the set off at night. During the day, it blares away constantly, selling the dreams of a corporate advertiser, or showing the unending gloom of a daily news report. There are marks in the dust where he has wiped a finger into the grime before. Patterns of days gone by. Days like today. Just like tomorrow, he thinks with a sigh. He wonders about why the screen collects the dust. Something to do with the static electricity. Like when you rub a balloon against your hair so it can stick to the wall. He can see the reflection of the room in the grey window. The TV for once looking out instead of them looking in. The dumbness of this remark brushes a smile on his lips. Look in it see the outside world. The plug sits in it's socket. He doesn’t take it out. He never takes it out. Maybe, he thinks, he will do so today. Remove the power from the world. Unplug the source. Pull out of the aerial as well. Better yet, cut the whole damn plug off. He fingers move toward the plug, wondering every time you switch a TV off, does a TV salesman die? But he knows he will do none of these things. The TV will remain for the children to switch on at some early hour to watch cartoons, and it will be on till he switches it off after watching the late movie, alone. His wife already asleep. He wonders when he began to hate the television. When did it become such a complete necessity for modern living. The centre of attraction in a room. The lack of conversation. All the time spent staring into a square box of cheap plastic and electronics. A grey slab of doom. There to be worshipped, like it had come out of the film 2001. He leaves the TV as it is, and crosses the room, capturing himself in the screen. Becoming part of what he hates for a moment. A blink, and he is out of it's unstaring eye. He pauses as he reaches for the light switch, looking back into the room. He knows he has to clean the dust from the screen, the detritus from his life. With a click he sends the television into darkness, and himself to bed.

						   The lump in his head still ached. He tosses and turns in his bed, the sweat making any position uncomfortable. He keeps rubbing the point where the lump exposes itself through his hair. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was where the lump pushes down inside his mind. Into his brain. Spreading out, taking hold. Causing blockage as his doctor put it. Pressure on his thought processes. Stupidly, it was when he was trying to sleep when it was at it's worse. Something to do with being horizontal. It did not cause him that much pain, at least he had felt worse, but it was the knowledge of it's weight that haunted him. He could feel it. Feel the excess baggage in his head. He had tried everything to get to sleep, from extra exercise, to the latest fashionable herbal cure. But still, the only time he could really sleep was after several hours when he had to get up. All the time lying in bed waiting for the lump to kill him. To burst or to finally expand so far that it turned him into a vegetable. But those weren't the worst times. Those were when he keeps from falling asleep, too afraid that he will never wake up again. He hasn't told anyone. Not his girlfriend, not his mates, nor his parents. His doctor has advised him to. But he just clams up when speaking. Like always. It had been hard enough to speak to a stranger about it. 'It would be a weight of your mind,' the doctor had said. He still isn't sure if he was making a joke. His girlfriend thinks it's just insomnia, or something that will pass, some anxiety. She had taken to leaving him alone in bed, thinking she was disturbing him. So he could finally get a good nights rest. Leaving him when he needs her the most. To curl up against when the bad thoughts come. When the lump in his head wont let him be. This night, like always, his head running through the options. How to sleep when your eyes are dropping, but your mind still active, your head still beating. Lying in bed to find all sheep counted and all dreams dreamt.

						   His typewriter is red. He inherited it from his father. It has black keys with the letters engraved in white on them. It's a proper typewriter. The keys have to be pressed hard to imprint themselves on the page. It's clacking, a joy to be heard. Sometimes he just hits keys in any random order, just to listen to that sound. Better than a computer any day, he feels like a proper writer when he sits at it. Hitting the letters. Punching out words and stories. It's what he remembers about his father. Watching, listening to him type. That and the smoke from his cigars. He was always puffing away on them. The way the smoke spiralled into the air. He buys cigars now as well, though he doesn't smoke himself. Far too conservative for that. He likes to light one and have it burn away to itself as he sits at his desk and types. He is proud of his desk. Not some cheap and nasty chipboard thing from Argos, but a solid piece of wood. Varnished in a dark stain, he doesn't know what type of wood it is, but it makes him feel important to sit at it. The chair is an executive design. Black leather, of course. On the desk, to the right, a silver picture frame, and old photograph of his parents. To the left, a two tier filing system for mail, answered and unanswered. (Both Empty.) A present from his mother. And pride of place goes to his father's typewriter. A fresh white page sitting in it. The paper is expensive, specially purchased for it's ability not to smudge. The ink tape difficult to buy, he has to drive several miles to a specialist shop. Though he doesn't mind the journey. Rather, he relishes it. He loves looking at all the shelves, all the accessories. Remembering the days he brought each one. And further, they don't mind him coming in each week. Even the days when he doesn't buy anything. Always greeted by a smile. He runs his fingers over the keys, gently responding to his touch. He watches each metal finger rise toward the paper, the tape rising in unison. Though he won't strike the paper. This is not the time for random crunching. He presses the space key a couple of times, just for the sound of the clack. Though without the final press of ink against page, the sound is anaemic.  Maybe today, he will write the story that he is sure sits in his head, waiting to be written. He lights a cigar, and waits for inspiration to strike, all the time smiling at his wonderful red typewriter.

						   Reading his name in print came as quite a shock to him. His first thoughts were that the paper was making up stories about him, but he soon realised that there must be another person with the exact same name as him. Of course his name wasn't a common one, but it was quite within the realms of possibility that there was someone out there also called Berton Andronomus Clark. Once he had got over the initial terror of reading things about himself he did not know, he sat down and read the entire article twice through. It appeared that this Berton Clark had been caught robbing a bank, but had somehow escaped from police custody. The details on this point were sketchy, but there was one thing that irritated him. The description given by the paper matched him, in a basic sort of way, going no more than medium height and build, which really could be anyone, but also matching to hair and eye colour. He knew someone would soon ring about his likeness to this other Berton Clark, but he was sure he could easily convince anyone it was another person reported about in the paper.  He sat back in his armchair, smiling. Yes he was not a bank robber. He hadn't escaped from the police. He hadn't been arrested. He realises that he is waiting for someone to call. Waiting for the knock on the door. A good friend laughing that he had come to arrest him, take him in for questioning! Even the real police. 'Sorry for the mistake sir, of course it must be another Berton Andronomus Clark. How silly of us to make the mistake.' He gets up, and stretches. His arms ache. He rolls up his cuff to find his arm is bruised. He does not recall how this happened. He thinks he must have bashed himself without realising. He looks at the telephone. A horrible cream push button affair, the receiver hung on top. He wonders why it hasn't rung yet. Surely someone he knows has read the paper? He looks closer, to find that the phone has been disconnected from the wall. Like the bruises he does not remember doing it. He supposes he must have tripped over the cord pulling it from the wall, and perhaps in doing so bruised his arm. But he is not convinced.  He looks about him, his home seems terribly messy, like some one had gone through it, searching for something. But who? The police. Of course. They had made the mistake of thinking this was the other Clark's home and had searched it for evidence. They were the ones who had unplugged the telephone. He feels some comfort in knowing this. The realises his house has been rummaged through for no reason. He picks up the phone, reconnects the cord, and dials his local police station.  He catches sight of himself in the mirror. Of course the reflection is distorted, the person he sees is a reverse of the person everyone else sees. There is a fresh scar on his temple. He runs his fingers along it. His head hurts, He realises it has been annoying him for some time now.  Ever so slowly he puts down the receiver. Replacing it. Maybe there is only one Berton Andronomus Clark after all. He grabs his coat. And makes towards the door. His mind racing. By the door there is a packed bag. It is full of his clothes. In his coat pocket a wad of folded money waits his hand. The keys to a car he doesn't own sit on the hall table. With dread he leaves his old house, and knows he cannot return. Quickly but very, very quietly he closes the door behind him.

						   Perspiration. Her cheek’s red. The run had done some good. Stopped her thinking at least. Gulping air into her lungs. The Shower beckoned. Her life trapped safely in routine. Stopped her mind wandering. But of course, the more she realised she wasn't thinking about him, the more he popped into her head. That was the vicious circle of it, she thought. Noticing that you're not thinking of something makes you think on it. Hands on hips, bent over, waiting for the beat of her heart to slow, remembering how he liked to press his ear to her chest and listen. Her hands in his hair. Repeating the action, fingers clutching at the lost times. She stands up, shakes her hair out. She should not be remembering him. He was the past (his kisses on her neck). She had chosen to forget. Gotten rid of all the touches he had made in her life. All the little mementoes and keepsakes. Thrown away. The photos burned. (The taste of his tears as she held him when he woke from nightmares.) He was as good as dead to her. She presses her right toe against the back of her left shoe, and pulls her foot free, without bothering to untie the laces. Her left toes performing the same feat for her right shoe. She flicks the now discarded running shoes under the occasional side table, thinking with glee that he hates it when she does that. It will really wind him up. (Except he isn't here to be wound up.) She puts her keys on top of the table, in the saucer with the loose change. Her feet in red socks. There's a hole in the right one. Just on the nail of her big toe. It's then she realises the socks are his. He brought them for himself, but never wore them. Why hadn't she remembered this before? The last thing of his she owned, now worn away. Still the shower beckoned, and it's call could not be easily avoided. Cheeks returning to their natural pale colour, her breath caught up with her need for oxygen. The hot water of the shower returning her to the bliss of routine. The socks thrown in the laundry basket, waiting to be repaired.

						   From Burroughs to Sinclair via a trip by Guevara, he had searched for Norton for some small while now. The clues were there to be found. Not for nothing was the computer software named so. Though now somewhat sullied by an extra camp TV presenter, he would not give up the trail. Even when that trail had long since gone cold. He owned the bike. The exact make and model as Guevara rode. In fact he had two. One he kept untouched, though not unloved, and one he used all the time. He drove this motorcycle each time he took up the quest. Searching the city for faint traces of that elusive beast.  Norton. The name to be whispered in secret conversations, to be screamed in frustration, to be hunted. He did not know if it was a first or last name. Even a nickname. But it was the name that touched his soul. That sent shivers down his spine when he found those six letters in print. Each day he would go through each and every single one of the daily papers. Scanning the words. Looking for articles written by him. Stories about him. Even checking the personals. A way of contact there. His footprints, his fingerprints could not remain hidden for long. He knew there were others like him. Riding the bike, hunting down the old maps. They had to be avoided though. What if he knew something they didn't? He could change his name. Become Norton. Take up the mantle. But the world had gotten used to the name he had. And it scared him. He knew simply changing his name meant little. There were already 187 Nortons in the phonebook, 44 in the business directory. He had followed them up. He hadn't been the first to do this. Doors slammed in his face. But these people where just echoes. Images of the real Norton. His unknown accomplices. No. He would not become another anonymous Norton. He must find the original. The only. Even if it took him every day till his last, he would not give in. All this time, already passed, he barely remembers why he had needed to start this journey. He knew he had to complete it. That was enough. Why Norton had remained so elusive was unimportant. What would happen after he finally caught hold of his movements was doubly so. The chase. It's all that filled his heart. The unending, relentless chase.

						   She glared at the sun and it glared back at her. Her head against the grass, the freshly cut smell irritating, but bringing with it pleasant memories. The sun seemed early this morning. The sunrise almost over when she had arrived. Missed the first stroke of the day, she felt some anger. But it would pass. Just how many times she had done this, she was unsure. But it was always worth it. When they have cut the long grass, the very next morning still wet with dew, the blue and orange coat, all followed like a ritual. Her favourite coat. Only now worn to lay on cut grass.  Her arms spread wide. Fingers reaching, stretching. Nestling in. (There's no one to reach to.) She hadn't always come alone. The memories of days in college spent worshipping the death of the long grass. All her friends around her. Sometimes even a picnic. Alcohol and good times. Outlast even the sun. She smiles once again. The sun warms to her. A small breeze plays around the end of her blue summer dress. Another summer soon would end. She sits up, and flattens her dress out as best she can. Looking at her purple painted toes, her huge black boots discarded by her side. Soon she would have to join her departed friends in getting a job, start resembling her parents, stop wearing these clothes, no longer be able to have the time to waste laying in the grass. But not yet. There's always time for one more summer. She lays back. The sun deep in her eyes. The long red afterburn, staring back.

						   Sometimes. It was always sometimes. Never once and unique, or always and total, just sometimes.  Sometimes he could get the highest score on the pinball machine in his local bar. An old thing out of place, there for a piece of retro design. But it worked, so he played. But there were times when all his balls disappeared without him barely scoring a point.  Sometimes, he would sail through the questions with ease, other times he would struggle with the first, the sweat on his brow blossoming. He hated these times. The cold perspiration made him self-conscious. Made it harder to think. But they didn’t stop firing questions at him. The self-assessment test they call it. No right or wrong answers. Except for all the ones he gives. They say no pressure, but he knows that his job is on the line each and every time. He hates the job. But he needs the money. Trapped into it, because no ones else would hire him. He had been out of full time employment for too long, now he had to go back to his old work place, go back to where he had been determined not to return. That was why he had to undergo the questions. As if they are trying to gauge his loyalty. Sometimes, the paint goes on the canvas with passion, with an urgency that can startle him. The raw state of the painting leaves him breathless. Those are the good times. These are moments, when he’s away from work, when he forgets that he even works, and life moves into a fluid motion, everything seems easy. He becomes a master of his actions. Sometimes, he thinks he will be able to leave that job. Escape the questions. Hand in his notice and walk out the door, like he had before. But those sometimes had gone. Occasionally, he will meet someone. A someone that he wants to spend more of his time with. Those first meetings, and the first weeks, are what he lives for. The slow dance toward the first kiss. Moving in and out of each other’s shadow. The long conversations about hopes and dreams that they still have. Waking to find someone still wrapped in his arms. But it never lasts. The bitterness he feels for work gradually seeps into his relationships. Slowly destroying all that he wants to protect. The moment of joy fades. He wishes that these were the moments that lasted longer, were more frequent. At least, well, just one of those times.

						   The cold, invisible, imaginary arms wrapped around his chest. Tightening. All breath gone. It only happens when he is between sleep and waking. That moment when he can still remember his dreams; still hear the screams from inside his head.   Finally, he falls fully awake, cold sweat stinging his eyes. The arms gone, only the faint white marks of fingers pressed into his skin remain. He tries to bring the dream back, to remember who held him so close. But, as always, it fades as quickly as the marks on his chest. He watches the blood return, flushing out all evidence of the night.  He keeps to his routine. Gets up, reaches for the wall to steady himself from the dizzy spell he knows is coming. Washes the clamminess from his face. Switches on the television. Makes toast. Making toast is, in itself, a whole ritual. Getting the bread just the right shade of brown, waiting for it to cool, then just the right amount of spread.  He watches the television whilst eating. He keeps the sound low, not ready for the spilling of words in his head, the dreams still there, if not in substance then in memory. The cold fingers. Once, they were round his neck, but that hasn’t happened for a while now. Just the death hug. Squeezing him into submission. Things begin to seep back into his head. The claustrophobia of the arms. Now he needs the noise, the television’s constant background hum to drown out recalling the night. He hits the volume button on the remote sharply. Press and hold, the whole world’s news exploding into the room. The noise level too high for normal consumption, but just right for blocking.  His head swims into the days and last night’s events. Election news, but not from his country, the continuation of the war. More people dying. A train disaster. More people dead. He flips the station over. Anything to escape the images of horror on screen. He doesn’t want anything to do with it. He didn’t march against the war, he knows that his one voice wouldn’t have made a difference. There had been plenty of other people going. There was no need for him to take part. Sports news. He was safe with that. Something he cares about. His national team winning. A shared experience watched in the bar with friends. Celebration. The first moment of despair as the old enemy, the opponent went ahead, the ecstasy of his team, his love, going in front, then going on to win. He hadn’t been that happy for some time. He wonders why the dream came last night. Why he dreams of being hugged so intimately.   He wraps his arms round himself, feeling for the place where the fingers pressed against him. The marks matching exactly to where he stretches his own finger tips.

						   He wants to stick a knife in your eye. If not a knife, then anything sharp and pointed. He wants it to burst. He hopes it will pop like a balloon. Spurt the vitreous humor everywhere. Laughing all the time. He would clamp your head, so you couldn't move, couldn't escape. Rig up the knife so he didn't have to hold it. So it remained a fraction away from your eye. So close you can't even focus on it's tip. So close, if you blink it will cut your eyelid. Then he will push. Very, very slowly at first. To see if the lens bends from the pressure. Then, all in at once. It makes him laugh, each and every time. Watching you keep so still, watch you praying that it's all a bluff, that someone, anyone, will break down the door and rescue you. But no one will come. No one does come.  Pressing home. Piecing. Screaming. But you've still one eye left. Giggling he approaches with the knife.

						   He walks as a ghost amongst them. They see him alright, he just doesn't register in their memories. Just another face in the crowds. How many people did you see today, when walking to the tube, sitting opposite you, standing next to you at the bar? How many of their faces do you remember? Most likely none. Perhaps, if they had striking features, or said something that made you laugh, you remember one or two. But this man, this phantom, does not have striking features. He makes no one laugh; because he does not speak to people he doesn't know. No one gives him a second glance. It passes into his thoughts that he is invisible, or at least only partially visible. That once looked upon he disappears completely. But this fantasy is soon banished when someone walks into him and tells him to ‘Fucking move!’ He can remember a time when he didn’t resemble a ghost. A time when he had a few close friends. When he was studying at university. Even then, he was then one listening, while all those around him talked. He didn’t mind that, because though he was quiet, he was still involved in their discussions. But since leaving, he hasn’t kept in touch despite promises to do so. He gets the odd piece of email occasionally, he doesn’t reply immediately, so he can compose his thoughts, write something witty and interesting. He spends the whole day thinking about it, perhaps writing a draft. Then he logs into his account, hits reply, and types out the letter. However, he does not send it. The act of capturing the letter into words and sentences makes it sound stupid, all the jokes fall flat. He hates it. He deletes it. Now he never responds to any correspondence. He can’t blame his past friends. He has nailed the coffin tight. He changed his address and left it and that, receiving only offers to enlarge this, clear up that. Safe little things to be deleted. He has trapped himself in his own silence. He has gotten so used to not speaking he just nods and shakes his head if called upon, does he want fries with that; will he participate in a quick survey.  He walks as a ghost. He walks like it because he has made himself into one. Drifting along with his life.

						   The animal in the ceiling keeps him awake at night. He thinks it's a rat, though he has never seen it. It runs around in the space between floors, a quick scamper and flutter of feet across his bedroom's ceiling. But it's the scratching that drives him mad. Digging its claws into the walls and wooden joists supporting the house. Sometimes the noise is so loud he thinks it is inside his head, he has to sit up and turn the light on. Always having to check the room for the unseen rodent. Searching with a flashlight into the corners his bedside lamp doesn't reach. He worries about the wardrobe. He can't see behind there. Worries that there's a big hole in the wall, the rat ready to pounce. Jump on his bed and scratch at him using claws sharpened on the inside of his walls. Going straight for his eyes. The tactic to leave him blind and exposed. More than once he has spent hours awake in his bed, hands clutched over his face, protecting his sight. He knows that this wont, in reality, happen. Should there be a chance meeting of his nighttime nemesis, no doubt it would be just as scared of him, as he is of it. But that doesn't stop the thoughts from coming, the nightmares each night.

						   The smile quick, and meaningless. No love or passion there. His eyes fall away from hers. Returning her dead smile with one of his own. But never looking into her eyes again. The conversation over quickly, he just wants to get away. Escape from 'just being friends.’ A chance meeting that he wished had never occurred. A chance meeting he had engineered into happening. He had sat at that café for four days now, knowing that she would eventually come past. The café called 'A Shot In The Dark' from a book or a film he thinks, but doesn't know. A place made for people who like to order their coffee as dark as the devil and as sweet as a stolen kiss. Black and two sugars. A place for them to pose and be seen. To hang out and pretend that they are cool. Or at least hang round with those they deem to be cool. It's a real celebrity magnet. If you like the kind of bland celebrities that go there. He doesn't drink coffee. Can't handle the caffeine. It's her place to come. And he follows along, because he wants to be part of her life. But he's just caught at the edges, sipping a hot chocolate. Trying to disappear, in a place where people come to be noticed. Of course she was always in the centre of the whirlwind. The main attraction. Dancing with ease between groups of people. Flirting dangerously. Driving him mad with jealously. But he did nothing about it. There was nothing he could do. All it caused was arguments. And, as she always pointed out, he was the only one she went home with. He still carries a photograph of her around in his wallet. Taken in the café. A moment when she smiled at him, included him in her life. Taken with the small digital camera he always carries around with him, to capture the little memories.  A throwback to when he had wanted to be a photographer. To when he believed he was. He takes it out and looks it at it each day. Even now. Unwilling to give up the past. The memory of good times. Slightly blurred, her face luminous, framed by the darkness of the surrounding café.  The hot chocolate he has ordered has grown cold. He has hardly touched it. Just turning the cup round, now and then. The handle passing from left hand to right hand. The photograph in front of him, on the table. Soon someone will come to ask if he wants anything else. Get him to move on so more fashionable people can sit down. He finds anger in this, though no one does come. Finally, he stands up, hurriedly, spilling the cold chocolate across the table. Dark liquid flowing into her hair. The picture of her hair. Drink mixing with photograph, covering her eyes. He reaches for it. To clean it. To keep the memory.   But he doesn’t. Just watches the paper absorb his drink. He leaves it to it. Never again to look into her eyes.

						   The sword was his grandfathers. In fact, it had been in his family for many generations. A true heirloom, their only heirloom. It should have been his fathers first. He knows this most deeply in his heart. Each time he runs a finger along the hilt, he thinks of the father he never really knew. It is a truly beautiful thing. Not overly ornate, the handle wrapped in black, pristine from lack of recent use. The pommel only slightly larger than the hilt itself. Smooth, the family crest etched into the very end. The cross piece containing a large red jewel planted right at the meeting of blade and hilt. ‘The Red Eye,’ his grandfather called it. Blood red with a chasm of blue black in it’s depths; the iris. It seemed to move with him round the room. The scabbard of red leather cracked, mounted over with brass. It had been replaced once, but that was so long ago, that it seemed to have always belonged to the sword. That left the blade. He had only ever seen the blade once, when his grandfather presented him the weapon on his 21st birthday. ‘Son,’ he said. (He always called him son since taking him in as a child.) ‘This sword has been handed down through the male line of your family for more generations than there are records for. It is said that while it is in the hands of one of our family, good luck shall always be our companion.’ With that, he drew the sword completely, and presented it length wise, to his grandson, bowing low. He had returned the bow, and let the sword rest on his upheld palms. He remembers just how heavy he had expected it to be, and how much lighter it had turned out to be. He had stood, gripping it tightly, then pressed the flat edge of the blade against his forehead, bowing once more to his grandfather. The blade was made of folded steel. A close inspection revealed it’s making in the patterns of folded metal along it’s length. There was engraving as well. The crest repeated, and writing along the entire length. But he could not read this. It was overly stylised, and written in an ancient tongue. When he had started to replace the blade into it’s scabbard, his grandfather had stopped him. ‘You must never draw the blade without the intention to draw blood. This you must swear.’ His grandfathers voice solemn, heavy with memories. He had sworn. His grandfather had taken the sword and nicked his thumb on it’s razor edge. His grandfather passed the sword back and he followed suit. The pain strange in such somber circumstances. The blade was returned to its sheath.  That day was over twenty years ago, and he has not unsheathed it since, not even after his grandfather died. The cut on his thumb is still visible. The sword rests now on it’s specially made holder in his formal seating room. It should have been his fathers first. But his father could not inherit it. When he had been just a child, both his father and his mother had been killed in the last Great War. One day, he knows he will pass it on to his own son, named after his grandfather. Knows that he will repeat all that was said and done. Knows that he will get one more chance to gaze upon that blade before it is gone from his possession. Till then it stays where he has kept it for all these years. Always catching him in it’s red eyed stare.

						   The songbird raises him to wake. It’s call of morning glory filling the air. The windows lay wide open, for him to capture the song each start of day. Even on the cooler days he opens them last thing before he falls to sleep. The songbirds cry, the only enduring thing of beauty left within his life, now he lives alone. It was not always thus. Before the whole house had swam with the song of his wife and three daughters. The laughter of tears brought to his eyes. When every moment seemed to contain it’s own beauty.  He has though often of capturing the bird. Placing it in a small cage, so that it might beguile him with it’s song all through the day, but he does not. He believes that once captured the song will change. That music too often played will dilute itself. The final lasting moment of precious life lost, caught within a steel cage.  His daughters gave him more to smile about than all the songbirds in all the lands would ever achieve. He can still remember bouncing each one on his knee, telling them fantastic stories of far away places. Of princesses, and knights, of honour and of beauty. But, as with all things close to him, each daughter married. Moved to those same distant lands. Each day the songbird comes, he takes him longer to rise from his bed. Shuffle to the window and rest his aged hands on the white window still. Gazing into his garden with memory. The small tree he, himself, planted. Watched as it grew with him. The many seasons of fallen leaves he has raked away. The branch that his songbird sings form each day. He can’t help but think of the bird as his. His wife died soon after his final daughter left the family home to start her own. He feels robbed of the years they could have spent together, finally alone. He knows she would love the songbird the same as he. The songbird finishes it’s morning rousing call. He watches it calmly, as it regards him, before suddenly taking flight. Gone within a blink of his eye. There will not be many more mornings left for him to hear it’s song. Still, he thinks, it will wake him those last few days, and that, at least, was a thing of joy.

						   She practices on dolls. They make them look so lifelike these days. From wide eyes to button noses. She likes to dress them up. She makes the clothes herself. She likes little uniforms the best. Soldiers, nurses, doctors, firemen, policemen. She even makes little accessories like badges, stethoscopes, and guns in holsters.  Of course, the dolls are nothing like real babies. The plastic that made from is hard and un-giving. She longs for the softness of a real baby. To hear it gurgle with delight as she puts it in her homemade clothing.  She takes her doll everywhere with her. She only ever has one at a time. Though she has had several different ones over the years. She has a special rucksack to put her doll in, that can be carried either on the back, or on the front. She likes the doll on her front.  Everyone around her neighbourhood knows her. Smiles when they see her and her ‘baby.' many even ask her how it's doing, fawn over it, admire it's clothing. She always smiles happily in reply, enjoying the attention. The one thing she doesn't like is when they ask the doll's name.  'Oh no,' she says. 'It doesn't have a name. It's just a doll, after all.'  They usually smile at her, nodding, thinking to themselves what a bright girl she is. But it's not really true about the names. She always has something to call them. The first doll she ever had was named after the next door neighbours recently born son, Tom. The next was after a girl five doors up the street from her. In fact all her dolls were named after real children. As soon as she found out there was a new child on the way, she got herself a new doll. Her latest was named Jack, after her baby brother. He was the last child to be born by anyone she knew. It was good that it was in her family, she thinks.  Her parents didn't know anything about this. Didn’t know she played with the plastic version of her brother. They didn't know about the names, they just brought her a new doll each time she asked for one. Always the newest type, with the most realistic features. Her parents never even asked what happened to the old dolls.  The dolls differ in other ways to real babies. Like when she is ready to discard a doll, she sneaks into her fathers workroom and borrows the knife he uses to carve wood. Dolls don’t bleed or scream when you cut off an arm; slice open then head; tear out an eye. She always starts with the fingers and toes. But, with each cut her attack becomes more and more frenzied. She mashes the plastic till there’s nothing left.  It’s good practice she thinks.  She has heard that new next door neighbour is having another baby. Soon it will be time to cut up, ready for a new doll. But this time, this time she thinks she has had enough of practicing. It was time to move on.  He baby brother gurgles with delight at the shining thing in her hand.

						   The girl, heavily bound and gagged in his attic room, had started to bang against the floor. He ignored her. There would be no repeat of Ishtar.  The banging continued. He knew it hurt her to do it. The only part of her she could move was her head. She had bruised the side of her face, yesterday, banging it against the wall. Now, since he had moved her, she had started against the floor. Using the back of her head as a hammer. At least if she bruised it there, he wouldn’t have to look at the disgusting disfiguring colours.  Ishtar had escaped by making so much noise he had worried someone might hear her. She, like all others before her, had had the full run of the attic space. She had managed to get past him, and he had to chase her into the woods. She stumbled, and of course, killed herself by hitting her head on a rock. It had annoyed him. It had been far too early for her to die. It meant he had had to break his pattern. He didn’t like that. He hadn’t ever changed the pattern. Always taking from far flung places. But this time he had worked on a new prospect closer to home. He had needs, after all. They had to be fulfilled.  He had taken more risks getting this girl. Far more than he should have allowed himself. And now she wouldn’t shut up with her banging. But he needed the inspiration. Inspiration only a special guest can bring.  It was his ninth year of bringing someone to stay. Sometimes his visitors stay for months, sometimes that lasted only days. The girl upstairs was still new. The bruising around her thighs, where he forced himself on her, had barely begun to show. He had been harder on this one. But she had to take the blame for the missing Ishtar. For all the risks he had taken to bring her here.  He remembered when he first saw Ishtar. He knew he would have to have her stay with him. It had been the most difficult invitation yet, but he had succeeded. Ishtar was something special. He had even toyed with the idea of asking her to stay forever. But now she was dead, and he was left with the poor substitute in the attic. The banging stopped for a moment, then started again, louder this time.  She would not be staying long, he thinks. In the hall of his immaculately kept house, he stands, with his hand resting on the handrail of the stairs, eyes raised upward. The banging incessant. No. She will not stay long at all.

						    Cautiously, cautiously. That was the only way forward. His stomach pressed hard against the earth. His uniform cased in mud, but that didn't matter. Soon it would get a new covering. In red.  He squirms forward another couple of inches Stops and listens. He tries to keep as silent as possible. In front of him, his rifle. Cleaned and checked just hours before. He had to make sure it was ready for battle. He didn't want to reach the final point and fall, simply because his weapon failed.  He sniffs the air. He's trying to take in every moment. Smell the time passing and keep it with him, should he survive this night. They say that smell has the strongest memory. That catching the merest hint of something can send you back into reverie for a long past age. So he keeps his nostrils flared. Fills his head with the smell of the earth below him; the scent of burning above him; the smell of death all around.  He shuts his eyes to deaden at least one sense so he can take more in with his others. For a moment, he is perfectly still. Lost in whatever thoughts surface, and fall in his daydreams. He cannot remain like this for long. He has to keep pressing forward. He knows that each way to his left and to his right, hundreds more men lay on their bellies, crawling into enemy territory. He cannot see them or hear them. Just as they cannot hear or see him.  He has lost track of time during his crawl. He doesn't know if he's in front of the line or behind it. He would feel stupid, seem cowardly, if somehow he had ended up a long way behind. To arrive at a battle only after it was over was unforgivable. But he also can’t get out of his mind what if he was well ahead of the main body of men. What if he arrived first? It would almost certainly mean his death. He knows there are many others across from him, thinking the same thoughts.  He lifts his gun forward, and pushes onward through the mud.  The possibility of a short trip with no return has clogged his thoughts these last few days. He has done his best not to dwell on it. Still, he has made plans. He sent a letter home yesterday, when the attack plan was given the final go ahead. In it he says goodbye to his family, without actually saying goodbye. He just didn't mention the future, the time when this war was no longer being fought. This is the first time he has done this. He hopes they can understand. He hopes they will have long happy lives, away from the threat of war.  Slowly, as slowly as he possibly can, he moves into the future of this, his life.

						   It's the darkness that gets to him. He doesn't know why, but it never fails to send a shiver down his spine each time the lights are switched off at the beginning of curfew. The whole city is plunged into gloom. Well, except for a few government buildings that is, and the watchtowers.  In the nighttime, the streets become far more dangerous places than they were during daylight hours. There were many smaller roads where even the small amount of light cast from the distant moon did not penetrate. And, in those unending shadows menace lurked. People disappeared into those dark corners. More, even than the government unofficially disappeared. Unless, of course, it was the government that was responsible. But, if that were the case, more care would have been taken surely? Parts of bodies wouldn’t keep turning up in the city river. There was a running sick joke among the rest of his fellow workers about what they had seen on the way into work. A special prize of a battered cup, itself a rescue from the river, was awarded for the most gruesome. Or simply for the largest amount of severed limbs. The strange thing about it was that although it continued to happen so often that it had become part of the background for their lives, no one did anything about it. He supposes that the city is far too large to police, but why continue with the curfew when so many people disobeyed it, and ended up as simple parts tossed away? And another thing, why did no one hear the screams? There were never any occurrences of reported shrieks during the night. He always kept a close eye on the daily papers. Not there was much in them beyond the party line. He knows he should do something about this. Maybe start up a campaign to make the streets safer places. He knows it’s a hopeless thought, though. No one would listen to him, except a certain branch of the security services. He doesn’t want to attract their attention at all. He could go out into the night, break curfew. Investigate. He knows that this is an even worse prospect. He would most likely find out who was behind all the killings, but only by becoming a victim himself. So he never goes out. Stays in and listens hard for an unheard scream. The moment of being dipped into the darkness will always terrify him.

						   The sun shone endlessly down. It would be one of those long hot days that last longer than you can imagine. The dust stirring as he walked. The road undistinguished, little more than where many feet had trampled, making the ground flat. He was coming to the roads destination. A small village, owing its existence to a long forgotten gold rush. One day the swirling dust would rise up and engulf it. Finally disappearing that which is almost gone. It did not appear on any map. He doubted it even had a name. Probably even the local people only referred to it obliquely as ‘The Village.’ His mouth is dry. It has been many miles on foot to get here. He wonders if someone will sell him some of their precious water. There will not be bar. No one would bother exporting this far into long forgotten past.  The road leads to the center of the group of houses. A collection of white washed walls huddled together to try to hold back the unrelenting dust and sand. The middle of the village is in reality just where there are more buildings closer together. No formal focus like a statue, or church. There is no more road. You either stay, or turn back. He removes his hat, and wipes the sweat and dust from his forehead. He shouldn’t have come, but he had had to know. Would she be here? He knew that he had already given up in his head months ago. But there was always that tiny lingering niggle of a dream, where he would come across her once again; she would fall into his arms and his world could turn once again. He’s at a loss on what to do now that he has come. He doesn’t speak the language of the locals. He could pull out the much creased photograph, say her name. Point. Shout. Harass anyone who walked by. Knock on doors. But he doesn’t have the energy. The walk has sapped it from him. Finally wearing even his tiny dream of finding her down. He knows she is not here. It was the last lead. A final impossible straw to clutch at. He stands uselessly in the forlorn center of the near ghost village. His legs not moving, his fingers slipping in their grasp of his hat. The heat beating a dance inside his head.  Finally. It is over. She is gone. Completely. He has searched. No one could say he hadn’t searched. Trying everything, attempted all possibly means of contact. She was gone. The pain of loss, defeat and relief send him to his knees. He would walk back. As soon as his strength returns. Away from a village that didn’t truly exist. Away from a dream he couldn’t hold in his hand. A return to his life. He stands, turns. The road, the beaten track unfurls before him. He stirs the dust once more from beneath his feet. And still the sun shines on.

						   He was glad of the shade of his tree in his garden. A large oak sitting upright in the middle of an expanse of grass. He sits underneath it during the summer months, to read, to write, or sometimes, like now, just to sit and enjoy the tree’s shade. He has thought of putting a seat down there, next to the trunk, but he already has his spot. A place between two huge roots. The bark worn slightly smooth from him sitting there. He feels the tree has grown around him, though of course, the tree is far older than him.  It’s the sort of tree he would have loved to have had in his garden when he was a boy. A tree that could have been a real adventure. Maybe he could have built a small tree house up there, or at least a look out post. He has planned it often, sat beneath its branches. Just where the main platform would be, whether to use a ladder, or a rope, or puts rungs directly onto the trunk.  The tree is the only reason he brought this particular property. The house itself is pleasant enough, if far too small for him. He had pretty much discounted it before viewing and had only come because his first choice had just had an offer accepted on it. When he first set eyes on that magnificent deciduous colossus, he knew he must buy the house.  He watches as new leaves form and burst to life; watches the acorns swell and fall; watches the slow cascade of golden leaves onto the lawn. Even in the cold winter months, when the bare brittle branches reach skyward, the tree holds his attention. All the windows of the house facing it are uncluttered with curtains; their sills empty from ornaments. Just so he can view the tree from rising in the morning to when he sleeps. Even at night when his wandering mind keeps him from rest, he looks out to the tree. Sometimes bathed in the moon’s reflected rays, sometimes almost hidden into the dark night.  However, it is the summer he loves the best. When the sunlight is caught flitting through the leaves and he sits against the trunk, lost in whatever thoughts the tree may impart.

						   From his bed he could just see the sky. He had to crane his neck, stretching taught the muscles. It meant he couldn’t remain in that position for very long, but at least he could see it. Today, small puffs of white cloud moved across the deep blue expanse of sky. He wished he knew the names of the different types of cloud. He means to ask his brother each time he comes, he feels sure it would be something his brother would know. But every time Jack, his brother, arrives, the talk is of other things. He smiles at the thought. That for once there was more to talk about than the weather. Jack visits him everyday. Well, almost everyday. There are times when he knows his brother is too busy to come and visit him. In fact, he’s surprised just how often Jack does come. He doesn’t begrudge his brother’s time away; he knows that his work is important. He also knows that he is a burden to his family, lying in bed, day in, day out. He has been there for over three months now. There didn’t seem to be a solution to his problems, his ailments. Sometimes he wishes that there was an end, even if was the final full stop, just to stop living in this unending moment of monotony. But each time he glimpses the sky in those snatched moments he knows he will clutch on to every last second. His brother will be coming soon; it’s about the time he always shows up. He stretches his neck and peers out of the window. The hospital buildings encroach on the sky, but there is still enough blue to see. The clouds still move slowly, a small breeze, he thinks. He really must ask his brother about the names.

						   The blindfold was tight across his eyes. He's not scared. He knows he should be, but he's not. He's been brought to a new room. It's lighter here. Lighter than the room where he's been kept for the last three days. At least he thinks it's been three days. Three periods of light, and four of dark. Three days. He thinks maybe he's outside now. Though he doubts this to be the case, he likes the idea of it. The silence is total. Surely if he were outside then he would be able to hear something, feel the breeze on his face. But there's nothing. No birds, no breeze. He must be inside still. Just in a room with more windows. He shifts his weight slightly, taking care not to move too much. He doesn't want to draw attention to himself. The ropes around his wrist have been rubbing into his skin. He can't tell it they have been bleeding or not. The floor feels cool under his knees and on the bare part of his legs. He thinks it must be some sort of stone. It’s a strange existence to be deprived of sight and movement for so long. All you have is your inner monologue. At first there is fear, but that gives way to a certain calmness. You cannot do anything or say anything, or interact with your environment in anyway. Like being in a coma, he thinks. One day he will stop being in the coma, to live or to die. When they were captured, two of their group had been shot immediately. The local guides. He didn't know their names. He would never know them now. He didn't know what happened to Chris and Pete. Maybe he was kneeling next to them right now. Perhaps they were keeping as still and silent as he was. If he could just move his arms, maybe he could reach out and touch them. But he can't.  He's not scared. Not at all. The blindfold keeps the world around him away. Without his vision he doesn't feel the terror he thinks he should be feeling. The knowledge that he is likely to be executed soon merely amuses him. He wonders idly what colour the blindfold is. He had to be dark. Perhaps black. Or maybe a dark brown. He would have chosen red. Red was a good colour for a blindfold. The light was fading. Another day ends he thinks.
