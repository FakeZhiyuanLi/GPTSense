       we used to walk thru the halls of Hillsdale High?   we'd round the square a zillion times before homeroom?   Mr. Mack would yell at people in the hall just because it was fun?   Mr. Shonk was giving something other than notes in class? Oh yeah... on test days.   Mr. Taylor wasn't the best teacher ever? puh-lease   we couldn't play instruments?   the first time you bowed on opening night?   the stench that lingered in the chem-is-try room?   cutting in line was actually daring?   you actually cared what the person next to you was wearing?    &nbsp;  Sorry.. someone is beginning to get nostalgic, can you tell?   Only one month til move in...

      Mouse Trap Double Dare, and all its varients when girls had cooties (or guys, in the case of . . . everyone else on this blog. Why do I always find myself outnumbered?) Windows 3.1, when the only games on the computer were solitare and minesweeper the early Goosebumps books green ketchup when it seemed like forever before we'd get to drive . . .

       Yay! There are five of us now. This should be very interesting as long as people keep posting. I know it's summer and we're all kind've busy with this and that, but I think as soon as school starts up and we start getting into things (band, plays, college, etc.) there will probably be more to be said.     &nbsp;  So yeah... LeeAnne and I were watching "I Love the 90's" on VH1 the other day and we started thinking of things we remembered from back then. So we thought it would be fun to put some stuff on here and just say "Hey, remember that?!" So I'll go first, obviously.    &nbsp;  Remember...    &nbsp;   The talkboy like in "Home Alone"   ( I loved that thing...)      Furbies   ( Unfortunately, I have one of those scary things)      The tomagachi and giga pets   ( Yeah, I had a few of those)      The beanie baby craze   ( I have a whole basketful in my room from my grandma)      Tickle-me-Elmo   ( Can't say&nbsp;I&nbsp;have one of those...)      When the Indians actually made it to the World Series    (Those were the gold ol' days)      Those TGIF shows every Friday    (Man, I always watched those)      The cartoons that were on all morning until noon on Saturdays    (Always watched those, too)        &nbsp;  Well that's all I've got for now. If you think of anything, just post about it. It's fun to think about the fun we had when we were kids. Such carefree times...    &nbsp;

       What's a Hillsdale blog w/o LeeAnne? I mean, come on! I WAS Hillsdale! lol or something like that... Nothing exciting to say except that I kinda miss it... and I feel like kind of a nerd for writing on this but I am DARNED PROUD to be a Falcon. Remember? Once a falcon, always a falcon. All of you current falcons... seriously consider becoming a beaver. It's like a bigger, better Hillsdale... just drug-, clique-, and marching band-free. I know, I know, it's hard to imagine, but w/e... I guess that's all I have to say?! I'm just proud to be here! WOO!

      I don't know how many of you will recognize the name Brian Nabors, but he used to be the choir director at Mansfield High. Well, I know him because he also was musical director for the youth theatre productions at Mansfield Playhouse.   Well, just before the fall performance of Annie Jr, Brian moved to Chicago, where he'd been offered a better job. But he's moving back to Mansfield this fall. He took a job at Shelby.  Brian is the coolest guy ever. He's hilarious and a really good music director besides. He can make anyone laugh. Well, he stopped by our cast party to say hello and tell us what was going on.   well, thinking ahead to Hillsdale's future, I told him that if his job at Shelby fell through, he could always take a job at Hillsdale in a couple years when Mrs. Sherburne retires.  Brain laughed at me! He said Shelby was far enough away from civilization, thank you very much, and that he had no inclination to teach at any school with "hills" in the name.   So I told him I'd put our band up against any band in a three-county radius, and we'd see who was laughing then!  Don't rag on the small guys!  PS- he'd still be a great choir director!

      So yeah. Um . . . hi. I'm Matt. Some people call me Matea. (Long story, don't ask.) I don't go to Hillsdale. I mean, I used to go to Hillsdale . . . a long time ago. Well, a year ago. But then I graduated . . . or got kicked out, I don't remember which. But I was there for a while, and I worked there for a while, so I know it pretty well. So . . . I guess that's why I'm here. Yeah. I have three blogs now . . . none of which are mine.  So, Hillsdale. It's pretty cool, even if it is out in the middle of no where. Although, I notice they started all the cool stuff after I left. The humanities class, the newspaper . . . but that's okay. I'll survive.  Anyway, you'll probably get a lot of college ramblings from me . . . once I'm back in college that is. But for the most part, I'll probably just sit back and let the people who actually go to Hillsdale ramble away. If I know the people that Jacqui probably invited to this blog, they're very good at rambling. (Incidently Jacqui, Tarah's email is blondie26_2006@hotmail.com)  Which reminds me . . . who else did get invited to this blog?  Go Falcons!  "I don't want to spend a whole day talking about bananas."

      I can finally update this thing!! I've been so busy lately, I haven't really had time to get back on here and inform my two whole readers (woo) of my life's events from the past 5 days or so. Well here goes!  Friday: Well for some reason, I am having a brain lapse and I can't really remember what I did all day up until the evening. Oh well. Well my mom and I were going to go clean the office we clean every weekend, but on the way we saw my brother walking on the road because he was walking the dog up the the park and so we told him we'd drive by the park to make sure my dad and brother were there because he was going to see them. And they weren't. So we picked Drew and Dakota up and we drove over to the elementary school because we figured they'd be there practicing on that field. And they weren't. SO we drove over to the high school. And.....we found them on the softball diamond. I decided I wanted to try hitting. I bet it was a sight to see: I had flip-flops on, with a skirt (below my knees, don't worry), and a tank top...Trying to hit a baseball. It's a lot different from softball. And I haven't swung a bat in about a year so that didn't help. So my dad decided he wanted to hit so I had to pitch to him. I didn't do too bad at that! =) Then I went home because I was supposed to be meeting up with people to go to the movies. It was a very confusing situation (I'm not going into details because I'm still confused about it!) but we ended up meeting at Brad's and then going into Mansfield to the new movie theatre and we met LeeAnne there. We were going to see "Dodgeball" but it was sold out. Soooo....we ended up seeing "The Chronicles of Riddick." It was an interesting movie. We got there about 10 minutes before the actual movie started so since there were 8 of us, we were stuck in the 5th row. If you see that movie, do NOT sit that close. I had a splitting head ache afterwards. But it was still fun. So I got home around 12:30 and went to bed.  Saturday: I had to wake up early because my grandma and grandpa Switzer were coming down to spend the day with us. So they got here around 10:30. My dad, brothers, and grandpa went to an air show and my mom, grandma, and I went to the Prairie Peddler Festival. It was pretty fun. I ended up buying this purse made out of Capri Sun things!! It's really cool! After spending a few hours there we went to a flower place and then back home. I slept on the way back because I was so tired from the night before. Then we all went to Pizza Hut for dinner. My grandparents then went home and we had to stop at the store to get some paint to touch up a couple spots on my car. So I got home and then mom and I went back in to Mansfield to clean the office we clean every week. When I got home I called LeeAnne to figure out what we were doing that evening and we deicided she should just come over. So she did. My parents, her, and I all started to watch "Jeepers Creepers" on TV, but we decided we wanted to watch one of our scary movies on DVD instead, so we ended up watching "Darkness Falls." We made fun of a lot of stuff. It was fun. Did you ever notice that in scary movies the people are SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?! I mean like in "Jeepers Creepers." Why would you go back to a house where you saw some evil dude tossing dead bodies into a rusty pipe?! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE?! Honestly. Dumb people. So after that we were playing The Sims because we found some cheat codes and we made a huge house for us and everything. And then we realized that it was one in the morning, so she left.   Sunday: Was Father's Day. So when I woke up in the morning I decided I wanted to write my dad a poem to put in the card we got him. So after my creative juices were flowing I came up with this: "Today is Father's Day, And there are a few things we need to say. Thanks for being such an awesome Dad, And sticking with us through good and bad. When it comes to sports you know it all, Like when an umpire makes a bad call. Your silly jokes always make us laugh, Now let's go to the zoo and look at the giraffe! (Sorry, it was the only word that rhymed with "laugh.") Most importantly we want to thank you For being the Dad that you are and all that you do. WE LOVE YOU!" So we gave Dad his father's day gifts and then we went in to Brunswick to my grandma and grandpa Switzer's to give my grandpa his gifts. Then my brothers and I went to our friend's house there whom we've been friends with for years. So I got to see my friend Brittany. We played Trivial Pursuit out on her driveway, it was fun. Then we came home and I took my car out and drove it around for a while. And I am doing so much better, if I may say so myself. I felt good driving it that day. So then I came back home and packed up my stuff for going up to the lake and went to bed.   Monday: We left the house around 11:00-ish I think to go up to Port Clinton near Lake Erie. On the way there I made a really cool button bracelet. But I dropped the bag of buttons IN the car, so they were every where. We stopped at Taco Bell (I love that place) and then went on and finally got there. When we got there we found out that pretty much everyone was off somewhere doing something. So we went by the golf course there and honked every time my cousin Chris was about ready to swing his golf club. We finally go their attention, and Chris and David (my two older cousins) came down to see us. After talking with them for 10 minutes we went in to the resort place to change into our swimsuits and we went out by the pool. I didn't feel like swimming so I laid out on a chair by the pool until my Aunt Bridget and Grandma came and we talked for a while. Then I realized how burnt I had gotten so I got out of the sun for a while and then we went to my grandparent's place to change. After that we went over to where my cousins and aunt and uncle are staying to eat dinner. All 14 of us ate over there and then we just hung out for a while. Then my cousins Lizzy, Lauren, and Teresa were going to go swimming over at the pool and asked if I wanted to go with them, so I went and changed and met them up there. I actually had fun. Sometimes I feel kind've left out because they're so tight knit, but I had fun with them!! We were making fun of the lifeguard because she looked so grumpy with this permanent evil look on her face and then we were laughing at this 8 year old kid with..well nevermind. We had fun and we went in the hot tub for a little bit and then went back to their place and about 6 of us played a never ending came of uno until we went to my grandparent's place to go to bed. I slept horrible that night and had to wake up the next morning @ 7:00 to go fishing.  Tuesday: So I kind've wake up around 6:45, but I am half asleep and the TV is on right next to me on the news talking about how people were lining up at four in the morning to buy Bill Clinton's book and I was having a dream about that and Joe House had waited that long to get one and then he was saying "Yes, I have been a huge supporter of Clinton ever since he announced his running for the presidency in such and such year." And I was ticked at him. But then I woke up and realized it was on the TV. It was strange. So we eventually got moving and my grandpa, brothers, mom, cousins David, Chris, Chris's fiance Val, and me all went to Big Boy's to eat breakfast. Then all of us minus Chris and Val went to go get some bait for fishing. Well I have a tendency to get motion sickness sometimes like out on a boat I did once and I used to all the time in the car, so my mom thought I should take something so I didn't get sick out on the boat. So I took this stuff called Drammamine. It said to take one to two tablets, but my mom said "Just take two." So I did. Well I was tired as it was from getting up early, but this stuff made me so drowsy!! We were getting fishing licenses from the store and the guy is saying, "And you need to sign here please" to me and I'm just staring straight ahead, off into space. And he's like "Umm..you need to sign here pleace." And I'm like "Huh..oh me. ok.." And then I felt like I had a speech impediment and my words were slurring together. It was so awful. But I did NOT get sick out on the boat. So that was good. I had fun though. It was really wavy so it was hard walking around the boat sometimes. I caught 3 sheephead...and a rock. I am not even kidding. I caught a big chunk of rock. It had zebra mussels on it. It was quite odd. I was going to keep it, but I didn't want to kill the mussels. My cousin David and I were talking a lot out there though. We have a lot of common interests so I feel closest to him. He's 3 years minus 2 days older than me. So after fishing for a few hours we went back in and got some ice cream from a place near by. We were standing there eating our ice cream when we hear this really loud music, bass cranked up and everything. So David and I turn around expecting to see this really pimped out car and everything...but no. It's a rusty old van. It was really funny actually. And David talked about how he wants to get a car and get some ice cream truck music on a tape and crank it up really loud and have the little kids chase him and laugh as he drives away. lol. Crazy kid. So then we went back to the resort place and my brothers and grandpa went putt-putting and my mom and I went by the pool to meet up with my aunt and grandma. And we talked for a while but I was really tired still so I got a chair and laid down on it and fell asleep for about an hour. Then I got out of the sun because I was burning. Then we went back to my grandparent's place to pack up. We stopped by and said bye to all my cousins and family and went out to eat at Perkin's with my grandparents. Then we started to head for home. But we had to stop in Parma to stop at my mom's friend's dad's funeral (hopefully that makes sense). It was nice to see my mom's friend, but not under the circumstances. After that, we came home.  And here I am now... Today I slept in then ate breakfast and went swimming for a few hours. I am really tan now, which is nice, but some of it is burnt and it's painful.   Ohhhh...and I'm getting a cell phone soon!! We should be getting them tomorrow (My mom and I) so I cannot wait!! Tomorrow I work from 9-2 and that's it. I'm hoping to go driving today sometime... *sigh* I guess that is all for now! Later!

      *sigh*   I'm bored.  I need to be busy. I get bored very easily.  I hope I get busier than I am now soon because if my whole summer is as boring as it's been the past couple days, I won't be too happy. I don't want another yawner like last summer.  Yesterday, after I finally got dressed around 3:00, I took my brothers for a ride in my car because they had been wanting a ride in it. We ate dinner and then I drove my dad to church for his brass practice just so I could get some more practice driving stick shift. So I sat there and read one of my books until he was done. Then we went to Brooke's baseball game in Hayesville. They were doing pretty bad when we got there. They put Brooke in to pitch, and he did pretty good, but the umpire was really bad. His strike zone was so small it was ridiculous. So my dad kept complaining, really loud. And eventually....he got yelled at. It was embarassing, but the ump was really bad. It makes us appreciate Scott even more. *sigh* He really needs to start umping again. He's awesome and funny! What more could you want?! I saw Brooke Stoner, my coach from last year, up at the park and talked to her some about the team this year. She said she wishes I could still play (makes me feel good!). They have a game tonight up there so I told her I'd like to come and watch them sometime, so my mom and I might go tonight.  Today my mom, brothers, and I went into Mansfield to go shopping. I figured I'd drive so I could practice some more. It wasn't too bad, I guess. I was getting really frustrated a few times, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. We went to Kohl's to take back a skirt my parents had gotten me for my birthday that I really didn't like. So I got one shirt from there (a black and white tank top) and then we went to Taco Bell for lunch. Then we went to Target and I got three more shirts (a red-ish tank, a blue tank, and another red tank; they're all really cute!). And then we went to Best Buy. Dan still wasn't working today, which was disappointing. We were there FOR-EV-ER!! My brothers are worse than my mom and I shopping. They finally found something and I got a casette adapter thing for my car to hook up to a portable CD player so I can listen to CDs in the car. Then we went to JCPenneys and then we finally came home.  So that is the excitement for the past 24 hours. Not a whole lot. LeeAnne called last night to see if I wanted to go to Alive with her today, and I really wanted to, but my parents didn't think I could spare enough money for it because I have a car insurance payment coming up soon, so....I didn't go obviously. I really wanted to though because I've always wanted to go to that. Oh well.  Well I was going to post a survey, but I have to go eat, so maybe sometime later.

      Thanks again for the comments guys!! Thankfully I can actually read them through my email. Oh well, maybe someday I can actually read them on my BLOG PAGE!  As you have probably noticed, I love making up random titles to my posts. It's just fun and I'm hoping that it'll catch someone's attention like, "What in the world is she talking about?!" Even if someone thinks I'm crazy, I still want people to read this!! =)  Okay before I go into the events of the past two days, I need to get something off my chest and ask for some advice. It's about one of my friends. I won't say who, just in case she reads this, but at this point, I almost don't care. Well this friend of mine, we've been friends for some time now. Probably since 8th grade and we became really good friends in high school. This year however, towards the end of the year, she really started to irk me. She started to irk me like NO ONE else I know. I've felt like she's in constant competition with me about every stinking thing. If I like a guy, she likes the same guy. If I say something, she has to contradict me. If I complain about something, she has to say something like, "Oh you don't know the half of it. In my case...blah blah." If I say something I found out, like exciting news and I'd tell her she'd say, "I know!!!" Or if I'd say something about myself or family, like one time I was talking about when my dad's birthday was, she says, "No one cares!" She has just changed a lot. And it has really started to annoy me. But I'd still talk to her and invite her to stuff and try to do stuff with her, even when I wanted to scream. I put up with her. And here, I find out she told one of our friends that she is sick of some of her friends because some of them are "so immature." And guess who one of those friends is?? Yeah, me. Supposively, I am immature. What really ticks me off is how she can even say that!!! I mean she really needs to look at her OWN behavior: she is really loud everywhere (including places, like restaurants, where you should be quiet)...Ugh, I don't want to go pointing out all her behavior, but I just don't get it. How can she say something like that about me when I've always been her friend? I just do not get it!!!  *phew* Well I feel somewhat better. I would still like to throw my fist through a wall or something right now. Just thinking about it makes me fume. Blah...putting it out of mind...  Okay.  So yesterday LeeAnne and I decided we were going to go to the new movie place in Mansfield and see Troy since I can see rated-R movies now. So we get there, and we see it's not playing. So we're ticked because we really wanted to see it, I mean Orlando Bloom is in it! *sigh* So we went to see if it was playing at the movie place by Kohl's, and it wasn't. So we went into Kohl's anyway because we like that store. And we both ended up buying $3 picture frames, which are really cute. Then we decided we were gonna go back to the new movie place and see Shrek 2 instead. So we go back and we're paying for our tickets and we see that Troy IS playing...the sign for it was down, away from the other signs, but it wasn't playing until 9:55. So we decided it was too late anyway. Neither one of us have eaten lunch, so we decide we want to get popcorn for the movie. So LeeAnne goes and asks for a small drink first and the guy behind the counter is like, "Just wait a second, there. If you order a medium for only a quarter, yes, a quarter more you get 8 more ounces." So she's like, "Ummm..okay. You talked me into it." So then she's ordering the popcorn that we're going to split and she asks for a medium and he says, "Now, now. If you order a large for only 75 cents more you get this much more (showing the comparison of the bags) AND you get free refills if you want them. *smile*" And LeeAnne's like "Free refills?! Who is going to come out in the middle of a movie to get a free refill?" lol It was quite funny. Shrek 2 was really good, btw. I thought it was better than the first one.  So after that we went to Best Buy to see if Dan Kubasek was working. But he wasn't. So then we went to TGIFriday's for dinner. It was good. Then we went to Michael's to look at crafts because we're craft people. We ended up buying buttons and some elastic (which we used later to make these really cool bracelets). Then we went to B&N to look and see if we could find any interesting books. There were some *ahem* interesting ones. We're like "Oh...my. eww.." lol It was funny. Then we thought we were going to get some ice cream from Chocolatiers (i think that's what it's called), but it was closed. So we stopped at Gabriel Brothers to see if the had any cheap furniture that we could decoupage, but they didn't. So we went to Wal-Mart and bought a clear plate to decoupage. Then we went back to my house. And we both realized that in that one day, those 5 or 6 hours, we had spent thirty-five bucks each!! We were like "WHA-?!" But it was still fun...  Then when she left, around 11:30-ish. My dad was like "Jacqui, can you come over here, your mother and I need to talk to you about something." So I'm thinking, "Great...some lecture on my messy room or something." And I sit down on the couch next to my dad and he hands me this sheet of paper. So I look at it....         Hmm. It's a print-out from the internet.  Why is there a car on this print-out?  Hey....wait a second....  My parents, it turns out, have been looking at cars for a while. And they found this one. So today after I worked, we went and I bought it!!!! I was so excited!! I used money from my savings and now I will make payments to my savings each month. It is: a white 1996 Honda Accord. It's a really cool car. Usually I don't like white cars, but since it's mine, it's sweet. The only catch: it's stick shift. So that was an adventure today trying to learn to drive that. I'm so glad my dad is patient because if not, well it would've been bad. We drove around the Outlet Mall parking lot for about a half hour or more. I stalled out a lot at stop signs, but I ended up driving home on 42. So it wasn't too bad. The hardest part is starting from a stop especiall if you're on a hill. And it's quite scary if your car starts to roll backwards when you're trying to let up the clutch and push on the gas to go forward. Some experience!!!  Well I promised you that  ghost story  so here it is, then I'm out!  My grandpa, my uncle, and two cousins were somewhere out in the wilderness in Virginia (I think) some where. They went there to go on a fishing trip. So they fished the first day and then they went to the place they were staying at, this old bed and breakfast place. They were so tired they just went to bed right away. They can hear doors opening and closing throughout the night and creaking, but it's an old house, and they think nothing of it. Then my grandpa "dreams" that he is lying in bed when this little girl with long, silky black hair comes and sits on the edge of his bed. And puts her head on his chest, like a grandchild would to her grandfather. So my grandpa goes to put his hand on her head, and she disappears. The next day they go fishing again and come back. And this time he goes to this hallway at this place and it has all these Alice in Wonderland stuff: books, figurines, etc. So my grandpa is fascinated by all these books and he's looking at him, but he didn't really pay attention to the figurines or anything. That night he goes to bed, and he has the same dream again: a little girl comes, sits on the edge of his bed, lies her head on his chest, he goes to put his hand on her head, and his hand goes through most of her head this time, and then she disappears. He still thinks nothing of it. So the next morning they're all eating breakfast with the owners of this place and the lady says, "I see you were interesting in my Alice in Wonderland collection?" And he says, "Yeah, the books were amazing." And she asks, "Well, did you touch any of the little statues or anything?" And he says, "No, I really didn't look at them." And she says, "Oh because one of them was moved...but it occasionally is moved into a certain cupboard in this place." And my grandpa says, "Ermm..no I didn't touch it." The figurine is of Alice looking in some mirror and seeing a ghost. And she says, "Well it's happened before." And her husband is like, "Don't tell him...." And my grandpa's like "Tell me what??" And the woman goes, "Well, this place is haunted." Of course my grandpa and unle were shocked and the woman goes on to say, "There was a family that lived her in the civil war times: a husband, wife, and their daughter. The husband was away fighting in the war. And while away, some stray bullets hit the house and the mother and daughter were killed....in the room where you are sleeping. I've seen the girl once in a while." And my grandpa says, "Does she have black hair??" And the woman says, "YOU'VE SEEN HER!!!" And he says, "Yeah, twice!!" So that night my uncle and grandpa decide they're not sleeping, they want to see this ghost. Thinking of them staying awake is quite humorous because they are notorious for falling asleep at family get togethers. So pretty soon my grandpa hears my uncle's snores and he thinks, "Aw..the the birds with this." So he gets up to go lock this door in their bathroom that connects to another room and he locks the door when all of a sudden.... it feels as if someone has put their hands on his back. And they start to gently push him and then they are pushing him to the point where he was pushed up on his toes and he had to put his arms out on the door so he wouldn't fall over. And when he turns around...   no one was there. The next day they left and my grandpa went upstairs two more times to see if he could see the girl again, but he didn't. My grandpa did say though that he never felt threatened or anything, he felt completely at ease and he believes the little girl could be an angel looking out for the house, hoping to someday see her father again.  Creepy, eh?

      Well first off, thanks for comments, guys!! I love getting comments, it just makes me happy. :) The only bad thing, I can't even read my comments through my actual blog page, I try to and it messes up. The only comments I can actually read are from Cassie's blog. It's quite strange. So I guess I will just reply to my comments in here instead..I didn't get to see the play at AU this weekend because I was so busy with family and friends and stuff for my birthday, but I'm hoping I can go sometime next weekend since I don't have to work on Saturday. So maybe I'll try to go Friday or Saturday. And thanks for the address again, Matt. I have your guys' blogs in my favorites so I can read them whenever I get on!  Well the ACT went fairly well I thought. I got to the school about 2 minutes until 8:00 so I was fairly worried. I was walking quickly down the hall wondering what room I was in. Thankfully, Mr. Shambre was standing at the end of the hall talking to Mrs. Edwards and he like yells, "Jacqui! You're with me...room 105." So I'm like "Ok...umm..which room is that?" lol So I got in there right on time. PHEW! So we're getting started and filling out the info about yourself at the beginning. Well the night before I had my mom buy me some mechanical pencils while she was out because we don't really have anything good anymore, I was running low at the end of the year. So I have these new mechanical pencils...and I cannot figure out how the heck they work!! The top doesn't click in, there's no push thing on the side, you don't squeeze it, the tip turns, but it doesn't bring out any more lead. So I'm like panicking. I mean what if my lead broke, how would I get more?! So thankfully I borrowed one from someone. I got all 4 tests done this time, which makes me feel so much better. I think I did best in math because there was only one I didn't know the answer to for sure. I hate the reading and science sections. The selections in the reading just don't interest me, so I really have to focus on it so I don't forget what I'm reading. I barely got done with it though. When I started the science, I was starting to read the first passage and I seriously just wanted to give up because it was so ridiculous. I just wanted to walk out of the school and go celebrate my birthday, but obviously I didn't.  So afterwards I went home and just did not a whole lot. Sat outside at the garage sale for a while, practiced some marching band music with my brother and dad (that was interesting!! lol We tried to play the Star Spangled Banner in a round....not pretty). Then later I left to meet some of my friends at Pizza Hut. It was Carinna, Wanda, Holly, and I that ate there. Of course they had to get some of the staff to sing happy birthday to me, which was a tad embarassing, but since they didn't do anything too big (like put a hat on me, or clap hands, or sings some big song) it wasn't too bad. Rachel came right at the end when we were getting ready to leave. We stopped at Hallmark to say hi to LeeAnne (and so Rach could get me a quick birthday card, lol), then we came back to my house. It seems like my friends and I always end up making prank calls while we're here. So we ended up in my room talking for a while and wanting to call people just to be stupid. So we did...It was quite funny. We called Sheldon and left a funny message on his answering machine and we were gonna call Ken and pretend to be from some modeling universtity who's taking an interest in him. And I was gonna call Jon and talk with a Japanese accent/voice and tell him I was from the University of Tokoyo and that we were interested in him because of his high GPA in Chemistry and Spanish (he did nothing in Chemistry and he hates Spanish), but we couldn't find his phone number. And we called Andy and said something dumb to him, but he knew it was a prank call. But it was still fun because we were laughing....a lot.  Then Abbi and LeeAnne got there so we had some ice cream cake that my mom made. And then we played this game I got called "Scene It?" which was really fun. After that, Abbi had to leave because it was getting late and the rest of us played Dream Phone because we like to play old games like that once in a while. lol We're such nerds, but it was so fun and funny. Eventually everyone left. It was a lot of fun though.  Today we went to this girl from my mom and I's work named Brittany, her graduation party. So we were there and our bosses were there and they had gotten me something for my birthday!! It was so sweet of them! I got a purse with the letter J on it, a pair of cute flip-flops (because they heard I am the flip-flop queen...I think I have a pair for everyday of the week now), and a necklace. After that, we came back home for my family birthday party. I was so happy this year because I actually had ONE big family party. Usually I have to have 2 or 3 small ones because everyone is busy all the time. So it was nice to have one for the first time in several years. I got a lot of nice stuff and it was just nice to see everyone. They left around 8:00-ish.  Then tonight I was sitting in the house and it was steadily getting cloudier. My mom and brothers were sitting on the back patio and my brother, Drew, was looking at a cloud over our neighbor's house, Kory. And he says. jokingly, "That looks like a funnel cloud!" and my mom says, "Yeah right." And then the tornado siren went off. So we were going in and out of the basement a lot tonight. My dad kept going on the front porch, he wanted to see a tornado because he's never seen one before. My little brother, Brooke, was freaking out about everything. He said he wanted to sleep in the basement tonight and everything...but I think he's okay too.  Well that is all for now...oh yeah. My grandpa told me this really scary thing that happened to him about a week ago in this bed and breakfast place he stayed at. I will tell you about it later. The place was haunted......I leave you with that. =)

      Well thankfully on Thursday I didn't have to do as much running around as I thought. Mom found a ride to work and Drew decided not to go to golf. So I just had to go to the HS for the marching band run-through of the music. It was interesting.. I had fun though because band is always fun. I got to talk to Jon, which is always interesting. We mostly bicker and make fun of each other, but once in a while we actually get along. =) Jon knows I love him... okay, not really, but you know what I mean. I was so excited though to see what we're playing for Pre-game because  I  suggested "Joy to the World" for marching band. So I was happy. And I pointed this out to Jon, I said, "Guess who suggested this song to Mr. Taylor??" and he says, "I don't know..some moron...ohh..I mean, who??" That just shows you what it's like..   So overall the rehearal was pretty good I guess...I think we have a lot of work to do still, but we have all summer. It feels so weird to be a senior. It's just...strange. But in a way I like it, but I also miss LeeAnne and Chelsie and Brad and all the great seniors. *tear* Oh well.  Then I came home for a while. And Drew got out his sax and was practicing his music already. Well we have this guy, Kenny, re-doing our roof for us, so he was there. And I'm sitting on the computer when all of a sudden I see some kids run by the front window. So I'm like, "Eh..what in the world??" So I look out the front door and I don't see anyone, so I look out the back and it's my neighbor and two of his friends. It turns out the ladder fell.. while Kenny was on the roof!! So I guess he was calling to the neighbors across the street, so thankfully we got his ladder back up for him. He said, "Yeah..I was up there thinking, 'Gee...I wonder how far it is to jump the next house??'" o_O is he crazy!!!? Thankfully he was okay.  Later yesterday I went to LeeAnne's house for Girls' Bible Study reunion type deal. I went over about 2 hours early because she wanted me to. So I went over and she gave me my birthday present early. She got me an awesome card (it's quite funny), a cute bookmark with a nice saying on it, a hilarious book about a chocolate chip cookie, and a photo album. It was pretty sweet. So then we played Tony Hawk because WE ROCK... on the too easy mode...shhh..don't tell anyone. Well it turned out to be just Me, LeeAnne, Rach, and Holly because no one else knew or something, so it wasn't really a reunion. Oh well. We still had fun. So went to Hawley's and got pizza and then back to LeeAnne's and had dessert and we had a devotional time. Then we did those beauty mask things because they're fun and we took pictures of like everything. It was so fun. And then we decided to make a website, so we did. If you really wanna see it, just ask for the URL and I'll give it to you.   Then I got home around 10:30 and helped my parents finish setting up for our garage sale. Then today I did nothing. I woke up around 11:00 and ate breakfast and watched the end of a movie on TV. Then I worked on the ACT practice test while I sat outside at the garage sale. Then I went inside and watched "Ransom" on TV. Then worked on the ACT some more. I did all the practice except for the science, I did the first 5 questions on the science and I got them all right, so I stopped. But so far I've averaged a 30. I hope that I do better tomorrow.   I guess that is all for now. In less than 4 hours I will be 17!! =)

      Well I figure now is as good as time as any to update. I've been pretty busy, so I haven't really had time to.  This past weekend was so busy. Here it is:  Friday: My frist official day of summer. We went to Medina to go see the third Harry Potter movie. Then I went to Leanne's graduation party with Holly. It was fun. Then I came home.  Saturday: I had to wake up early in order to leave the house by 10:30. So I dropped Dad off at church for brass practice, while Mom and I went to the Carpenter Shop near AU to look for graduation presents. Then we swung back by the church to get Dad, then went home. When I got there, LeeAnne, Wanda, and Holly were already there waiting for me so we could leave to go party hopping all together. First we went to Christa's, which was back at my church. Then we went to the place were the Haunted Woods are in Ashland because we thought Nic Schwan's was there that day. So we get there and there's this whole luau theme going on and we're all like, "Hmmm...we didn't know Nic liked Hawaii." So we walk into the building there and we're like "Hmmm....why is Helana and her family here?? Where's Nic's family?? Why are there pictures of Helana everywh--....Oh no..." Yep, turns out Nic's is NEXT weekend. It wasn't Saturday. So we ended up at Helana's graduation party-- an hour and a half early. Whoops. So we looked at pictures for a little bit and got out of there!! It was quite funny. So then we went to Cory's, Tiffany Kidd's, and then LeeAnne's. We were at LeeAnne's the longest probably. It was a lot of fun. She had this huge pig though for the dinner, and its head was still on because it's good luck. Interesting, eh? We sang karaoke over there so that was a lot of fun. So after a lot of that, we went to Joe House's, and then to the Poynters' and Buzz's. We played volleyball at Buzz's until it got dark and left shortly after that. I just wanted to get home because one of my friends (not going to name who) has been driving me nuts lately so I kind've wanted to get away from her.  Sunday: Was an interesting day in several aspects. First I had to get up early enough so I could actually be ready in time to get to church about 45 minutes early and also so I looked good enough for graduation. Well I was ready in time but when I put my button up white shirt on, there was a spot where the material was wearing thin, so I was not happy, to say the least, and I had no time to find another shirt. So I was really frustrated, and usually when I get frustrated I get really mad and yell at someone, but instead, I was crying. Over a hole. Yes, I know, crazy. But I was stressed from my "friend" the night before and then this and graduation and everything. So I was crying for a while and we got to church and I was still somewhat upset because I felt really dumb with this hole in my shirt. There was this music group at our church that day though, "Tim Zimmerman's King Brass," so when I was walking in to sit down one of the guys in the group was grabbing his trombone from the pew and walking away and he kind've looked at me like "ehh..? what's wrong?" (and he was kind've cute too, I might add). So when the service finally started I was calmed down. The Trinity Brass (which is the brass group at my church, which my dad is in) got to play with this group and they were awesome! The music was wonderful. I was just so amazed at how good they were. It was awesome. So I felt great after church because the sermon was good and all the music was great. So after church we walk back in because Dad wants to buy a CD from this group and the cute guy from the beginning is the one standing by the stand with the CDs on it. So I told him they did an amazing job and it was just wonderful. And he was saying thanks and stuff. And he was really cute. And he even smiled at me and everything. And he was saying how great it was to be here and stuff...so yeah, after church I was in an extremely good mood. Then my family and my grandparents went to eat at Jake's after church. And after I ate quickly, I drove off to the HS for graduation. Graduation went well and I'm surprised I didn't cry. Really surprised. I thought for a moment that I might while we sang "Remember," but I told myself to not thing about the meaning of what I was singing, just sing the words. So thankfully I didn't cry. It was a nice ceremony though. I am going to miss the seniors so much, especially LeeAnne. So after that I went home and Holly and LeeAnne came over around 4:30 and we went to go to more graduation parties. We went to: Cody's, Carinna's, Neil's, Sherisa's, and then Brad's. We were supposed to go to Joel's and Mandy's, but we ended up staying at Brad's for like 3 hours. We played volleyball there too until we couldn't see the ball too well. Then I finally came home.  Monday: I woke up around 10:00 and started packing and getting ready to go to my grandparents' house in Brunswick. We left around 11:00 to meet them at Wendy's by the Outlet Mall because that is "the halfway point." So after eating, I left with my grandparents. We dropped my grandpa off at their house and then my grandma and I went shopping at the Strongsville Mall for my birthday. I found some cute stuff and then we went to Target to look at CDs and stuff. And then we met my grandpa at TGIFridays because I got to pick where we ate dinner, and I picked there obviously. For each of us kids, my grandma takes us shopping before our birthday to find clothes and stuff and when we find something, she buys it. And then she decides what to actually give us and take back because you know grandmas can't find the stuff we like half the time, so this way, we know we'll get what we do like. So after that my grandma and I went to Borders because I just had to go to a book store and I bought two books there. I'm so excited to be reading my first book of the summer. I'll write a review of it when I'm done. And I bought a book with craft ideas and such. So after that, we finally went back to their house. My grandpa was watching TV, so my grandma and I played this word game with cubes and then this older game called Careers. It was quite a game let me tell ya. It was funny. Then we all had ice cream and talked and such, and then we went to bed.  Tuesday: I slept in until almost 11:00 and we had waffles with bacon in the morning for breakfast (it was good). Then I took a shower and everything and I called my friend who lives up there to see if she wanted to get together while my grandma took my grandpa to his eye appointment. She wasn't home, but was going to call me back. But then I started feeling kind've sick, bad cramps, so we decided to go home early. So I got home and did nothing pretty much because I felt awful.  Today: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO BLOODY MUGGY?! Ugh...it's awful. It was so hot and gross today. I slept in pretty late again today. So eventually after getting up and eating breakfast, my mom, brothers, and I went into the basement to sort out some stuff for a garage sale we're having this Friday (come if you wanna buy something good!!). Then I took a cold shower because it's too hot. Even after the shower, I still felt gross. So I hung out in the basement because it's about 10 degrees cooler down there. I had lunch and watched TV and did my hair down there. Then my mom and I went shopping in Wooster for my birthday. I found some cute clothes and stuff. We went out to eat at El Canelos. It was good. Then we went to Wal-Mart to look at stuff. I bought some fabric and ribbon and stuff for a purse I'm going to make using that book I bought from Borders for directions. Then we came home and here I am.  Tomorrow I have to drive everyone around because Dad'll be at work and I need the car. I have to drop my mom off at work @ 9:00, then my brothers and I have to go to the HS @ 10:00 for a marching band run-through of music, then I have to take my brother to golf @ 1:00, and pick my mom up @ 2:00. This is all because I don't have a car. If I did, it would be much easier. I try to tell my parents this, but they just don't see it. Oh well. I got my report card today...I got all A's for the last six weeks and got A's on all my exams except....Advanced Math. I have no idea how!! I mean, I thought math was my best subject...oh well. But I still have my 4.0! Wooooo...  Well that is all for now, I'm out. *3 days until my birthday*  BTW, sorry if there are any spelling or grammatical errors in here, I don't feel like proof reading this whole thing.

      First about last night.... Casa Fiesta was a lot of fun. It was Cassie, Ken, Rachel, Joe, Christie, Holly, Me, LeeAnne, Chelsie, and Brad. Mrs. Connelly was supposed to be there, but she couldn't come because she had to plan something for a funeral or something...but anyway, it was fun. We were all talking about everything a laughing and making fun of people. And we got a lot of fried ice cream! It was good stuff too. Oh, and of course we made fun of how Ken eats with his pinkies out...that was quite funny.   After that LeeAnne and I went and wandered around Wal-Mart for a while, I mean after all, Wal-Mart is THE hang out place. *cough* Yes, I know it's sad. So we were there for a while looking at CDs, DVDs, and the craft section to see if we were inspired by anything. She ended up buying these little cloth sack things. So after that we came back to my house and we decorated the cloth sacks with (Sorry...I just had a quick interuption with myself...."Hey Dude" is on Nickelodeon right now!!! Remember that show?!?! It used to be on all the time. IT'S ON RIGHT NOW!! How sweet?!) anyway....we decorated the sacks with some fabric paint (after we found the paint amid all our craft stuff in the basement) and we watched "Sleepy Hollow." Then she left and I went to bed around midnight.  ****FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF SUMMER****  Yep, that's today!! So I didn't get to sleep in as late as I would've liked, but later than I have all week. I woke up though around 7:00 because I'm so used to getting up early, but I fell back asleep until my alarm went off @ 9:00. So I got up, ate breakfast, took a shower, did my hair, etc. And Wanda and the Mosemans showed up and we left to go to Medina. We stopped at the movie theater and bought tickets for "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" and then we went to Fazoli's for lunch. It was really good...anyway, we stopped at Marc's to get a snack for the movie theater (only 83 cents compared to $2.50...yesssss....) So then we went to the theater and saw the movie.   MY OFFICIAL REVIEW OF THE HARRY POTTER MOVIE:  Okay it was awesome. The scenery was amazing at the school. There was a lot more outdoor scenes, which I really liked. There was also a lot more humor in this movie compared to the other two, which I also really really liked. One example, Harry is studying late in his bed in their dorm when Ron wakes up and Ron says, "The spiders...they're trying to make me tap-dance. But I don't want to tap-dance!!" And Harry says, "You tell 'em, Ron." And Ron goes, "Okay...." and lies back down. Funny stuff. Also in this movie, I thought the characters seemed more realistic, like normal kids. It's kind've hard to explain, but when you see the movie, you'll understand. I really liked Buckbeak in the movie, he was really cool. The scene where Harry is flying on Buckbeak is really cool. And then there are the dementors...  they were really quite creepy. The scene where they first are on the train was really scary actually. It was cool though. And the time turner part was really cool, too.  My only complaints: I did not like that they didn't have the Quidditch Cup in the movie. That was a great part in the book, and I wish they would've included it in the movie. Also, they didn't explain who made the Maurader's Map, which I found somewhat disappointing. And I didn't like Professor Lupin as much in the movie as I did in the book.  But I guess that's why the book is always better. But overall, I believe this movie is my favorite so far!!  Well tonight, I have one graduation party to go to (Leanne Wilson's). Holly and I are going together, she's picking me up @ 7:30 and we're heading over. So that is all for now. I highly recommend you see the third Harry Potter movie because if you don't, you're missing out on a real treat.   Oh and from the place we went, we got a little lego thing to build the Knight Bus. How cool is that?! =)   Just keep smilin'!

      SCHOOL'S OUT FOR SUMMER!!!!! SCHOOL'S OUR FOR--EVER!!!! NO MORE HOMEWORK NO MORE BOOKS NO MORE TEACHERS' DIRTY LOOKS!!!!!  Yes, I am excited that school is finally out!!!!!! I thought today would never end. But it didn't really feel like the last day. It was kind've weird. But I was sad at the end of the day because Joe is going to a different school next year. *sniff*sniff* I gave him a hug though, I was really sad and I told him I'd miss him. That would suck so bad, going to a different school your senior year. I feel bad for him. Hopefully we stay in touch.   Today we only have 2nd, 4th, and 6th periods, so we had and hour and a half at the end of the day for make up exams, so my friends and I left early and we went to a state park nearby. It was: Me, Randi, Holly, Rachel, Carley, Celsey, Renee, and....Andy. lol Andy, the only guy. So we had a picnic. It was so fun because us girls were so hyper and giddy and we were laughing so much, especially Celsey and I. It was hilarious. Then Carley, Celsey, and Renee had to leave for church softball. So the rest of us went on a hike on the trails there. It was really fun. We hiked all the way to this small waterfall spot. So Randi, Rachel, and I stayed by them because we were gonna wait until Holly and Andy came back down because they wanted to climb all the way up. So Rach and I decided to run through the waterfalls. It was so much fun..and so refreshing. Holly did it too when she came back. It was so fun. We were soaked, but it was fun. Then we hiked back, and left.  Now, I have to go do my hair really quick because I have spanish senior night to go to at Casa Fiesta. I have to do my hair really quick too!! YIKES!  TOMORROW I SEE HARRY POTTER!! WOOOOOOOooo...Laterz!

      Well I downloaded this thing off the website www.makemusic.com. Next year, I am taking an independent study with my choir teacher and she told me to download this program and get familiar with it so when I'm helping her with the 5th graders next year, I know what I'm doing. It's actually really cool!! You compose music on this program. It's so much fun!! I already composed one song, it's not that great, but it's a start.   Tonight was my little brother's first baseball game. So I decided to go see him play in that tonight rather than going to Wednesday night church. The umpire there, well, I know him and he's kind've, well, annoying and I actually went out with him two years ago and he was going out with someone else at the same time (without my knowledge). But yeah, anyway. He was a really sucky umpire. I mean sometimes some of his calls were so bad. So I complained a lot. It was kind've funny actually. I mean I know a lot about baseball having played softball for about 10 years and watching the Indians since I knew what baseball was, so I was highly disappointed. *tut*tut* But my brother's team ended up winning 19-10. Since the owner of a dairy bar nearby has a kid on the team, she said that if they won they could get whatever they wanted from the dairy bar free of charge, and even if they lost they would be able to get a junior cone. So we had to take Doug home, but he came with us the the dairy bar and we all got ice cream. Then we dropped Doug off.   We stopped at Hawley's because my mom thought they would have a brownie mix for me to make for our picnic tomorrow, BUT they didn't, so I just bought some Archway cookies, hopefully my friends will understand. So then I got home and finished composing my song. And I am DEAD tired. ONE MORE DAY. I cannot wait for it to be over and I can finally sleep in!!!!!!!!!! I am going off to bed before I fall over right here right now...*snore*

      Well, here is my very FIRST entry here at blog. So far I'm quite impressed with this place. I haven't quite figured out how to look up other users yet because I know there are a few people here than I know, and I want to find them! =)   Well let's see... I am 16 years old, turning 17 in 10 days!!! Woohoo... I have one more day of school left, finally!! I have 2 exams to take tomorrow on my last day, Advanced Math and Chemistry, and I'm not too worried about either one.   After school some of my friends and I are going to a state park around here somewhere and we're going to have a picnic and then go hiking around. We always do something after our last day, so it'll be fun!! We might also go swimming at someone's house, but we're not sure about that yet.  On Friday, my friend Wanda and I and my brothers, mom, brothers' friends, etc. are going to see "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," so I am super excited about that.  Mainly, I'm just looking forward to summer!!!!!! Here is a list I comprised....in my head of reasons I am looking forward to summer.   Reasons I Am Looking Forward To Summer:  1: NO MORE SCHOOL!!! 2: No more homework 3: No more dumb english essays for 3 whole months 4: Get away from annoying people 5: Sleeping in! 6: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!!!!! 7: Reading what I want, as much as I want, when I want. 8: Going to bed late 9: Getting a tan 10: Swimming everyday if I want to 11: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!! 12: Getting away from frustrating friends 13: Vacactions 14: Cedar Point baby!!! 15: Not caring about how I look everyday And last..... 16: NO MORE ENGLISH!!!!!!  Teehee...well that is all I have to say for now!! Catchya later!

       urlLink         Well Cedar Point was a blast!! LeeAnne, we had so much fun and I just wanna go back!!!!!   Okay,&nbsp;are you ready for a massive&nbsp;post?! Woohooo! Here we gooo....       Sunday :    Okay Sunday I slept in pretty late and eventually got up and moving. I called LeeAnne to figure out what time we were going to leave and we decided we were going to leave the same time we had planned to begin with, which was 5:00 I believe. So before she came over to pick me up, I ran into to town to go to Video Update to get "Mary Poppins" since neither one of us have seen it in years. It took me like 15 minutes to find the darn movie, so after that I came home and LeeAnne was already there waiting for me. So I grabbed some last minute things, threw all my stuff in the trunk and said my goodbyes to my family and we were on our way. Well first we stopped at Hawley's to get a bag of ice for the cooler and that was when I screamed because Renee was tapping on my window and it scared me pretty bad. So after that, then we were on our way. When we got to Norwalk we stopped at a McDonald's so we could grab something to eat (burger, shake, and fries) and then we were on the road again. And after I finished eating my food we pulled over so I could drive the rest of the way.  I would like to thank my dad for his marvelous directions to get to Port Clinton. There was only one little mistake: there was no fork in the road. It's a good thing I knew where we were, having been there quite a few times, otherwise I think we'd still be driving. So we got to my grandparent's place, without getting lost even once! So we said hi to my grandparents and general talking and what not (stories of Grandpa in his youth) and we called our moms to tell them we got there safely. And then I remembered that I had forgotten my conditioner at home. So we all got in their van and went to the lovely town of Port Clinton. And like my grandpa said, if you blink, you might miss it. So we went to Kroger and I got my conditioner (and some shampoo that smells really good) and we headed back, but we ended up stopping at an ice cream place, where we met a black lab named Drew (how ironic!). Then we went back to their place and&nbsp;LeeAnne and I decided to go for a walk. So we walked up to the rec center area and went and sat out by the pool&nbsp;and just talked and of course laughed about everything.&nbsp;Got random calls from mom and other people. And there was a life guard there, which we found out likes Maroon 5. So yeah we stayed there&nbsp;and looked at the clouds (Hey that one looks like&nbsp;a....wow I can't remember what the heck it is called. LeeAnne help me!!! Please tell me what it's called or I might&nbsp;go crazy.) Anyway, so after we&nbsp;started getting attacked&nbsp;by mosquitos we decided we should head back to the place we were staying. And we weren't sure where to leave since the lifeguard had been locking all the doors and gates. So we looked helplessly around and the lifeguard came over (he was kinda cute) and said,&nbsp;"So have a good conversation?" And we were like, "Er, yes. We did. How do we get out?" And so he went over to one of the gates and just lifted it off the hinges and I said, "Oohhh. Now we know how to sneak in here at night." And he says, "Oh yeah&nbsp;because the fence is too high to climb over." The fences are probably up to my chest, so yeah. They're not that high.  So we got back to our place and watched&nbsp;"Mary Poppins." It's amazing how much stuff there is in there that you forget about. And those special effects, all I can says is.....wow. After watching the movie we eventually got to sleep.          Monday:        We wake up first around 7:00 because my grandma is clanging around in the kitchen. So we both turn over, eyes twitching most likely, and go back to sleep until my phone goes off at 8:00 and the TV turns on. I'm trying to find my phone because I'm about the throw it against the wall because I used the most annoying ringer as the alarm. So we lay there for a while not really wanting to get up. We do eventually and I eat breakfast and then take a shower, and am afterwards reminded about the limited hot water. Whoops. So LeeAnne takes a shower and I start to dry my hair, when I blow a fuse in the kitchen because of my hair drier. Whoops. LeeAnne gets out and is not feeling too well (fetal position on bed) and I finish up getting ready. We're eventually both ready around 9:30. So we get in the car to go to Cedar Point, baby!!!  We eventually get to Cedar Point (8 BUCKS FOR PARKING?!) without getting lost, I might add. And we park and basically just hop out of the car and go into the park, which we find is a major mistake later not paying attention to where we parked. So we get in finally and we're both just like "Wow..." So we go over to the massive line to get a locker so we can stash our bags in. And we get up to the cute locker guy, Lucasz (yes, the "z" was there) and we get our locker, which is conveniently on the very bottom by the ground *twitch* and we head over to the Demon Drop since we're so close to it. We wait in line for a while and we're basically bubbling with energy and excitement. So we get on the Demon Drop with two other girls about 3 or 4 years younger than us and we're freaking out more than they are. We're going up and I'm going "Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. We're going up. This is high. Oh my goodness." So we finally get to the top and it drops us. And as soon as we get to the bottom I start like dying laughing. So LeeAnne and I are laughing really hard, probably scaring the two girls next to us. After that thrilling ride we go to the Wicked Twister, probably my favorite ride. We both screamed bloddy murder I think. Then we go to the Power Tower, the up-side of course&nbsp;(AHHHHHHHH! Oh, there's the Lake. AHHHHHHHHHH!). After that we go to the Mantis. That is when we start to lose our energy and realize just how hot it is out. That period was probably the least we've ever talked together. It was just like, your mind has nothing going through it. Nothing. It's just static. You really don't think about anything. I mean there's the occasional, "Oh. Move up." Or, "Man, it's hot."&nbsp;But that's about it. Other than that, it's like a dial tone. It was also in this line though that we saw the Squat man with his hippie parents. He was really cute, blue eyes, dark curly hair. Yeah. About an hour into the line I point out how disgusting it is that everyone's crotches are on the seats of this ride, much to the disgustment (is that a word?) of LeeAnne. We finally get on the ride, and find out it was worth the wait. And my legs didn't hurt this time!! After that we decided we'll go on ONE more ride before we eat or drink anything. So we go over to the Millenium Force, which was another 2 hours. During the course of those two hours we must endure the most annoying human being on the planet standing behind us who does not cease talking through out the ENTIRE TWO HOURS! Yes, he was very annoying. LeeAnne and I were killing ourselves mentally several ways through out those hours. We also came to know TW, the Third Wheel. Yes, the well-known third wheel. When a guy and his girlfriend go somewhere, but guy's brother is drug along, he is known as the Third Wheel. We felt bad for him, especially because he was pretty cute, other than his big nose. So we finally get on the ride, and it was definitely well worth the wait. I love that ride.     After that we are so parched and hungry we shlump off towards the food. We finally get there (after I led us the wrong way) and I get a corndog (yum) and I say, "I don't care how much the pop costs, I want a LARGE." Man, that was the best Diet Pepsi I've had in my ENTIRE life! It was so good. So we sat in the shade and ate and drank our massive pops while birds flew unusually and uncomfortably close to our heads. After that we decided to go on Disaster Transport because #1) it's an indoor ride, #2) AIR CONDITIONING, and #3) we wanted to let our food settle. The coolest part was waiting in line because of all the black lights everywhere. It made my class ring glow a very bright green (CAPTAIN PLANET!). And here we also had to endure the kid behind us talking about how much better Xbox live is than PS2 online. *twitch* After that we went to the Raptor where we once again saw Squat man. When we got on we did the thing Mary Poppins does with her feet and sang "A Spoonful of Sugar" on the way up the first hill, which I'm sure was much to the annoyance of the man in our car. But it was fun anyway. We then got Dippin' Dots ice cream (The ice cream of the future *cheesy smile). After that, I think we went to the Magnum, where we met up with TW again!! The line was very short so we got up to the loading platform right away. The "lines" up there were more like organized blobs. And so we got in the same organized blob as TW and we were talking about him and how we felt bad for him. And this kid in front of us kept eavesdropping on us, so we called him Ed (EavesDropper). LeeAnne said something about TW's ankles and I said, "It's not a tumor" in my best impression of Arnold that I could. So the kid in front of us is looking at his ankles. *sigh* What a dork. We had fun on that ride. After that we went on the worst ride of the day *duhn*duhn*duhn* THE WITCH'S WHEEL!!!!!!!! *screams then vomits* Yes, it was bad. We both felt like we were going to puke after that ride. We'll stick the coasters, thanks.  After that went on the Gemini, on the red side because it had been winning all the times we watched it, but we "tied" when we went on it (I'm prety sure we lost). Then we went over to the Mean Streak. At this time we were both questioning our sanity. I mean, why go on a ride that causes physical pain? But we soon came to find out, it wasn't so bad after all. We pretty much made weird noises throughout the whole of the ride. After that we decided we wanted to go on Snake River Falls to cool off a little bit. We ended up in a log with a couple and the one guy attends OU, and he was kind enough to tell me that there are usually parties every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. *silence* Yeah. So they asked us if we'd ridden the Dragster and we told them about how on the news we saw that a cable had broken and there was metal flying everywhere and a kid was pulling shrapnel out of his face so we didn't really want to ride. And the guy goes "WHAT?!" And his girlfriend goes, "I told you it was bad." And he goes, "WE RODE THAT?!" It was quite funny. Thankfully I didn't get too wet, it might be because I kind've covered my head and ducked at the wet part. After that we took the train back around to the center of Cedar Point so we could go eat dinner. You know, I never realized the Cedar Point workers were required to wave at the people on the train. Not until we saw the cute guy waving very unenthusiastically at the train-goers. So we waved at him and I could've sworn I saw him wave with a little more gusto. After getting off we headed over to Johnny Rockets and I'm pretty sure we got the only straight server for us. *James* When we left, we left him a heart made out of ketchup. I hope he appreciated it.  After that, we went on the Wicked Twister again, and surprisingly it didn't even mess with our full stomachs. I think when I screamed this time, it was definitely a blood curdling scream. After that we went on the Raptor again. You know, right now I can't remember if we went on anything else after that before the Millenium again. Hm, oh well. We were going to go on the Power Tower again, but we decided to just go on the Millenium Force one last time. And this is when we became pediphiles. At this point in the day, we were so desparate to talk to SOMEONE, we made conversation with a kid named Jed, probably about 14 years old. But we didn't care. It was someone to talk to and he was kinda cute. If you go to Cedar Point ever, make sure you ride the Millenium Force at night. It is so awesome. So after that we walked with Jed and his friend to the middle said bye and headed off to leave.  We got all our stuff out of our locker and waited in line to get the $5 back and return the key. This is where we met Gzeorgze (yes the z's were there). I about gave him a heart attack because I dropped the key trying to give it back to him and then he tried to give me a paper back instead of my 5 bucks, jokingly of course. Yeah, he was pretty cute. So we sadly began our trudge out towards the parking lot when we realized we had no idea where we were parked. Who knew it would be hard to find a dark car at night...We eventually found it and both kissed it when we did. We left and we got back to the place, WITHOUT getting lost!!&nbsp; When we got back we stayed up for a while until we both pretty much were out.         Tuesday:      We slept in until 10:30ish. And when we were both awake and I tired to talk, I was quite astonished to find that I had no voice, cause: screaming. So we turned on the Price is Right at 11:00. Got dressed and everything and I blew another fuse with my hair drier. So we spent much of the morning trying to figure out where the fuse box was. I called my mom, dad, and grandma. We still couldn't figure it out. Then LeeAnne found a list of things to remember, and one was where the fuse box was. So I finally wrenched it open and we set things straight and left. We drove by the pool to see if the guy lifeguard was there, but much to our dismay, it was some girl. So we drove back in to Port Clinton to go to the beach. And yes, it is a beach because a beach by definition is: *clears throat* a level stretch of sandy shore (and I just looked that up in my    red     Webster's dictionary). We stayed there for a short while and then drove around to see if we could find a pizza hut. We couldn't. So we went back to the shops and decided to check them out. Most of them were restaurants, so we went into one store and bought a big bag of M&M's. Then we decided we'd head home. We stopped at the Pizza Hut in Norwalk. I don't know how we did it, but we managed to eat a large pizza. LeeAnne thought she was going to pop afterwards, but thankfully, she didn't.  When we got back into Ashland the lovely rain greeted us. We decided we didn't want to go home yet because that would mean the end of our vacation. So we stopped at Hallmark so LeeAnne could pick up her paycheck and then we headed into big bad Mansfield. We made our weekly stop at Best Buy, much to my dismay to not find Dan. Then we went to the Mall and walked around there for a while trying to find someone...anyone. After hanging out there for a while we went to the pet shop by Kohl's and played with these 3 Jack Russel terriers for a while and this cute white cat. Then we went to the dollar theatre and saw *sigh* Tommy. Man, is he gorgeous. His hair, wow. It's prettier than mine. I just wanted to touch it. And his perfectly chiseled features. Yeah. He's definitely a looker. Anyway, we saw "The Day After Tomorrow" and we were quite glad we only paid 75 cents to see it. It was bad. I mean the wolves. And then the ending. Ugh. It was bad.  After that we came back to my house and sat around telling embarassing family stories (LeeAnne is like my sister I never had, she is seriously part of the family now after hearing half of those stories). Then we watched Daredevil. And *sniff* we then parted.       Wednesday:      Wednesday, Rach took me out to my Birthday lunch at Panache Cafe in Ashland. The food was great, but the guys there were greater. They were really really really cute and really really really nice. After that we stopped in at K. Sorellas to say hi to my mom and my fellow workers. After that we stopped at my house to get a few outfits then went to the Kingwood Center to take pictures. After that Rach dropped me off and I went swimming for a while. Then Rach came back over to spend the night. We were going to go in the woods behind my house to take more pictures, but we really couldn't find an entrance to them. We got more scratched up in the weeds back there that were taller than us. Then we went swimming until around 9:45 or so. We came in, changed, and watch "John Q." After that we watched the late night shows on TV and went to bed eventually.        Thursday:     Yesterday. Rach and I were going to go back to Panache Cafe for "dessert" but we decided not to. So she went home and I met up with my parents at Buehler's for the 75 cent ice cream cones. Then I went to the bank to get some money for gas and stopped at a gas station for some much needed gas for my baby, and it was only $1.76. After that I went home. I did nothing for a while and then turned on Grease on TV while we ate dinner. And while we were cleaning up my mom and I were singing "Sandy" with John Travolta. It was fun. I left to go pick LeeAnne up @ 6:30 and we used her free movie passes to see "I, Robot" in Ashland. It turned out to be a good movie. (*sneeze* Sorry I'm allergic to bull...shtuff) We love you, Sonny! Hehe. Then we went to Dairy Queen to get ice cream. After that we sang to Greased Lightning in the car because that's all my CD player could play until the battery died. So I dropped her off and we talked for a little bit and marveled at the lightning in the sky and decided we need to do something again soon. So I came home talked on the phone for a while, and then went to bed.        Today:    Today I slept in until 11:30 to find the house empty. Dad was at work. Mom had taken the boys out. So I got on here to tell you all about my fun time and now my brother has a friend over. Oh, and&nbsp;I still do not have my voice back yet. Hopefully I will do something today, or I will be bored out of my mind. Maybe "Troy" is playing in Mansfield. Tommy, here we come!

       urlLink   &nbsp;      Yes, tomorrow I will be gone. LeeAnne and I are leaving for Cedar Point tomorrow. We're gonna have tons of fun and hopefully we'll actually make it there without getting TOO lost. So I won't be here for a few days. I'll be back Tuesday sometime. So hope everyone has a good time whatever you're doing!     &nbsp;   Yes, this is the shortest blog in my history of being here.     &nbsp;   Oh and I  FINALLY  saw Dan today at Best Buy. Of course I saw him when&nbsp;I was feeling quite frumpy, but oh well!     &nbsp;   Goodnight. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Yesterday Rach called me and asked if I wanted to go to her house and spend the night for her birthday and she was gonna call a few other people and see if they could come, too. So I went into town and went to Hallmark and saw LeeAnne and she helped me pick out a card. Then after spending like a half hour there I went to Wal-Mart to pick up a present for Rach. I got her these dark chocolate Dove-brand candies that she loves (and that we ate last year in study hall when we were depressed). And I bought her some scrap booking stuff. Then I went home this different way (the way LeeAnne usually goes) and I learned it's about 3 minutes faster. Woohoo! So I quickly wrapped her stuff and packed all my clothes and stuff and went to Rach's.  As soon as I got there she just got out of the house and got in my car because we were going to the movies. It ended up being just the two of us, which was fun. We went to Wooster and we went a back way which was very interesting. I was kind've nervous because I had no idea where we were half the time. But we got there safely. We got to the theatre about 5 minutes after the show started but when we got in the theatre there were still lots of previews to see. We saw "The Notebook" by the way. It was such a good movie!! It was so incredibly sad though!! I mean, I figured I would cry, but it was getting close to the end and I kept saying to myself, "Oh I won't cry." But it got to the end and the tears came. In streams. The end was so sad and then it like ended and no one moved in the theatre. The credits had started rolling and no one moved, spoke a word, made a sound, except for the occassional sniffle. After a minute people started leaving. I just looked over and Rach and I was praying that I wouldn't start sobbing because I was on the verge of it and she was like, "Want a piece of chocolate?" And half choking on my tears I'm like, "Yeah." lol. It actually helped somewhat. We left when the credits were over. We were the last ones out. And so after that we were both very emotionally drained. It was funny though we thought we were gonna burst out in tears about anything.   We had to stop at the video store so she could drop off a movie and then we headed home. I was quite nervous driving back because I hate driving at night in places I'm not familiar with. I am pretty blind at night so I am so glad I have glasses and that my car has brights!! We finally got back to her house and LeeAnne came over. We just talked for a while and then got online for a little bit and set Rach up a blog on here then we went back upstairs to the kitchen because we were hungry. We made macaroni and cheese (my fave!) and we were trying to roast marshmallows over a candle, but it just turned black. So we roasted a few over the stove. And then we had rootbeer floats. It was good stuff. And then LeeAnne and I started singing "Summer Nights" from Grease because we sang it on Karaoke at her graduation party. It was so hilarious. I was recording it on my cell phone and we listened to it and we were dying laughing. We were all so giddy. You had to be there. So then we all changed into our pajamas, brushed our teeth and what not, and headed back down to the basement to go to bed. LeeAnne slept on a mattress on the floor, Rach on the couch, and lucky me, on the love seat. We talked for a really long time and we were laughing so hard about the stupidest things. And then we started talking about the government for a while, and I fell asleep.   So today when I woke up LeeAnne had already left and Rach and I headed upstairs to eat breakfast (Krispy Kreme donuts!) and tried to work out the Word Jumble thing in the paper. We couldn't unscramble "MESTIK." If anyone figures it out, please do me a favor and TELL ME! Then we went out to see her two kittens and cat and sat out there for a while. And then I got ready to go. I still had my pajamas on and said "Well, I figure no one'll see me anyway." And Rach was like, "Yeah, but you'll get pulled over and get a DWI...Driving while indecent." Hehe. So on the way home I was driving back on the roads by Brad's house and they were tarring and laying gravel down on the road and there was a sheriff/patrol guy there and I had to roll down my window to talk to him. How ironic, eh? So I did run into a police person. Then I got home took a quick shower, dried my hair straight, and my mom, brothers, and I left to go to Mansfield.  We went to Old Navy first to look at stuff for Drew's birthday. I did end up finding a really cute shirt though, so I got it. Then we went to Toys R Us for like 15 minutes, grabbed some candy from there, and headed to the dollar theatre by Kohl's. Okay I don't know what it is with me, but I thought the ticket guy was, well, cute. And it's very odd because he had pretty long hair. But it suited him. I don't know what it is with long hair and me. But I like it. Not too long, as long as it's groomed. But he was cute. ANYWAY, we ended up seeing the Garfield movie. It was pretty good. I mean I'm glad we only paid 75 cents for it. After that we met my dad at Steak N Shake for dinner. It was really good. Then my dad and brothers went home and my mom and I went to the pet shop by Kohl's (I forget what it's called) so I could see the animals. There were these adorable Jack Russell terriers. They were so cute. But this cat was sooooo cute. I wanted to get it out and hold it, but I just tapped on the glass and it seemed pretty content just following my fingers. Then I went back to Kohl's to meet my mom. And we were there FOR-EV-ER! I was bored out of my mind.   We FINALLY left and went to Gabe's. My mom ran in real quick, and then we went to Target because I wanted to see if I could buy this one bathing suit top, but the swim suits were all gone!! I was devastated, not really. But anyway. Mom bought a purse and we made my weekly trip to Best Buy. Dan of course wasn't working. In case you're wondering about this Best Buy thing, let me explain. Best Buy has become LeeAnne and my place to go while we're in Mansfield. I want to go because I want to see Dan Kubasek (he used to be in my grade, real shy, was home-schooled, became real outgoing). I just like talking to him because he's a cool guy now. So whenever we're in town I stop in to see if he's working. I've stopped not 3 times, not 4, not 5, but SIX times this summer, and have not seen him. So my mom asked some guy there and we found out he works this Friday and Saturday. Might have to stop back. =)  So mom and I headed home, in the pouring rain. I was sure glad I wasn't driving. And that leads me to here. That's about it I guess. Can't wait until Cedar Point! Woo! =)

      Okay. I slept in until 11:15 this morning. Whoops. Oh well. I needed the sleep.  Well I have some very exciting news. On Monday LeeAnne and I are going to Cedar Point!!! Woohoo!! I'm so excited. We're leaving Sunday evening to go up to Port Clinton to stay at my grandparent's place. I called them this past Sunday to make sure we could stay at it. I talked to my grandpa and he said yeah, that it sounded good and everything. So then I called LeeAnne yesterday and told her and we were all excited. Then on the way to Brooke's baseball game yesterday my mom tells me that my grandpa isn't so sure now. It's not that he doesn't trust us, it's the people up there he doesn't trust. So he was thinking that he and my grandma could come up and stay with us, which I really don't want, not because they're my grandparents, just because it was supposed to be a get away thing for ME and LEEANNE. So I was not happy. But now he's just gonna meet us up there and make sure we get in okay, turn the hot water on, and tell one of the neighbors we're staying there. So it's all good as far as I know now. But I feel really bad saying I don't want them up there with me. I love my grandparents, but this is just a friend thing. A chance for us to get away. So yeah. We're going on Monday to Cedar Point and coming home Tuesday sometime. It'll be a lot of fun.  But today I was watching TV and the news was on and a cable broke on the Top-Thrill Dragster there yesterday or something. So isn't that just great! I hope nothing bad happens, like the place closes down or something. It's just my luck. Everything always gets messed up for me when I really want something to go right. Hopefully everything will work out. The hardest part will be actually getting there.  Okay, I get on the internet just now and the MSN homepage opens up and there's this ad for State Farm Insurance to see which cars were most stolen in 2002. So I click on the ad just for the heck of it to see. I figure it'll be expensive cars or something. So the page loads and I look. Guess what is number  2  on the list?  Honda Accord. MY CAR!! Great. One more thing to worry about. You know what this means, LeeAnne. We have to guard our babies!!  *sigh* So I started the Hillsdale team blog. I just gotta wait for everyone to join and then it'll be great.  The link is www.blue-and-gold.blogspot.com  Well the organ/piano player/youth choir director at my church FINALLY called me about piano lessons today. I was in bed when he called and the phone kept rining and I was really getting ticked off. Thankfully the machine picked up. So hopefully I'll be starting piano lessons soon because if I want to be a music major, it'll help.   I thought I was going to go on a few college visits this week, but it looks like we're not going. We were gonna go over to Bluffton and Ohio Northern. But who knows! I want to see Kent sometime too, just to keep my options open. So far though I am definitely leaning towards OU. SO MANY DECISIONS!  Okay well I need to get off and start making lunch. We're having my favorite: corndogs. Yum.

      Well yet another brief post from me. I was thinking....  We should start a team blog or whatever and have all people who are attending or did attend Hillsdale. It could be very interesting. And there could be 5 of us. Just a thought. Tell me what you think!!  Also, Cassie: do you know any info about the musical we're doing for next year?? I heard that we might be doing "Brigadoon." Do you know anything about it??  Okay. Well here's one of those survey things. You guys can fill it out about me if you're bored enough! If not, I forgive you...for now! *evil grin* Also, you don't have to answer some of them if you don't want because some are brutally honest.   What Would You Do If..? I cried: I asked you to help: I died from natural causes: I said I liked you: I kissed you: I started smoking: I stole something: I was hospitalized: I ran away from home: I got in a fight and you were there: I got dumped: I pissed you off:  What Do You Think Of My..? Personality: Eyes: Face: Hair: Clothes: Voice: Humor: Choice of music: Mannerisms: Family: Body: Friends: Decisions:  Would You..? Be my friend: Tell me the truth no matter what: Lie to make me feel better: Spread rumors about me: Keep a secret if I told you one: Loan me some cash: Hold my hand: Take a bullet for me: Keep in touch: Try and solve my problems: Love me: Ditch me: Use me: Date me: Beat me up:

      Well I know this really isn't an update. But I'm bored and taking some quizzes. Here are my results!!   Which 80's toy are you?  You're a Spirograph!!  You're pretty tripped out, even though you've been known to be a bit boring at times. You manage to serve your purpose in life while expending hardly any effort (and are probably stoned to the gills all the while).   Well last time I checked, I've never been stoned....   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?  You are WILD AND CRAZY KIDS.  You couldn't get through life without a little fun... or a neon colored t-shirt.  You are a team player and really into Omar Gooding.  GO YOU!   Which Finding Nemo Character are you?  YOU ARE CRUSH!  Awwwww...I love Crush, dude!!  Well that is all for now. I'm at my grandparent's house right now. I will update with a REAL update later. Until then, byes!  PS. I redid this because it messed up my whole blog, but I just left what I was without the pictures.

      Well here's another short and sweet post from me. I was just reading some stuff about movies on here and I was reading an article by some guy for the upcoming third episode of the Star Wars movie and the last bit made me laugh so I had to post it on here. The writer of this article (and I agree with him) thought that the first two episodes were very dull and so if you liked the first two episodes, well I'm sorry. Anyway, here's what I thought was funny:  "Maybe the best thing to do would be to get Anakin to embrace the Dark Side as quickly as possible, perhaps by forcing him to confront some terrible disappointment that will haunt him for the rest of his days. We suggest this two-line scene set in a Coruscant restaurant:  WAITER: Here’s your green salad, sir. ANAKIN:  What?  You fool, I told you NO CROUTONS! Aaaaaaargh!   Anakin puts on his black helmet and storms off to his local county clerk’s office and fills out the paperwork to have his name legally changed to “Darth Annie Vader.” (He later quietly drops the middle name, realizing it doesn’t help his macho image.) And then for the next two hours, it’s all special-effects spaceship battles, which is the real reason most of us will go to the theater anyway. Fade to black.   Christopher Bahn is a freelance writer in Minneapolis "  Yeah, I think that's pretty funny!! If you want to read the whole article here's the link: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4980465 I don't know how long it will be there, but it's there today for sure!! =)

      Yes, Ricky is dead. Today is a very sad day indeed. Mark your calenders that today is the day that Ricky Racoon died.  As I was driving home tonight from Wal-Mart, driving around 45 mph, I was stunned to see a creature running across the road right in front of my car. I tried to slow down, but it was inevitable. Ricky was killed. Even though he tried to run with just three of his paws, his front paw held up in front of him like Igor, he was still unable to make it safely to the other side.  So tonight, my friend and I had a ceremony via MSN Messenger in honor of Ricky Racoon, and I have decided to post that ceremony here as a tribute to Ricky Racoon and all he has done for racoons everywhere.   Ricky Racoon XIII   Birth:  Unknown  Death:  July 1, 2004 Beloved Husband and Father  Yes, Ricky was a good racoon. He always loved going through people's garbage to get that one chicken bone at the very bottom of the can. And there was the little twinkle in his eye I when he reached for that chicken bone. *sigh* Yes, and what a lovely twinkle it was. And then one night he was running home to take that special chicken bone to his babies and his wife but he did not stop, look, and listen before crossing that trecherous road. Instead of running towards the light at the end of the tunnle the light came to him and Jacqui said (I mean) Jesus said, "Yes Ricky, It is time." At that exact moment he knew that he was leaving his family forever..and the trash cans with chicken bones, but he was not afraid, for he knew he was going on to a better place. And that was when his skull was crushed. The poor soul.  May he rest in peace.  Amen.

       This is the most depressing song I've ever heard in my entire life. It may not read that sad, but if you hear it, man is it depressing. I almost cried when I heard it the other day.   "Whiskey Lullaby"  She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night.  He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la  The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind, Until the night  She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la  --- Instrumental ---  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la  --- Instrumental ---  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la  La la la la la la la La la la la la la la    Now that I'm thoroughly depressed, I'm going to bed.

       Man, I can tell this is going to be a crazy post already. I'm already really hyper and about ready to start dying laughing. It's all your fault, LeeAnne! We have too much freaking fun together!!      Movie #11 of the summer:  The Village    ****    The Village was really good!! It is definitely a thinking movie. It is scary, but more suspenseful than anything. If you really don't like thinking, then don't see it. LeeAnne and I loved it though!! (Try not to scream....   AHHHHHHHHHHHH! oh..)    Yeah, LeeAnne and I went to see that. We were freaked out right at the beginning. We made sure we did not wear red because that would be bad. But I brought a red sweatshirt with a hood so we could try to freak people out in the middle of the movie. But I think we ended up freaking ourselves out more. Man, is there a twist at the end though. Afterwards we went to the Meijer's (sp??) gas station because I really needed gas and we were pulling up and there was this scary guy and we were like "AH!" and then we pulled up a litle more and there was a cute guy and we were like "Ooh?!" lol It was funny. Then I went 2 cents over what I wanted ("Aw, man!").  Then later, well actually earlier, we saw this little thing running on the road at a stoplight. It was like a mouse-sized pig. It was bizaare. (Okay, I really think my caffeine from yesterday is finally kicking in.) ANYWAYS! We went to Denny's afterwards to get ice cream. It was so good. We got the brownie a la mode. It was so yummy!! And we didn't have any money so we left the waitress two Sacagawea coins. lmao. Sorry. Now I will describe the scene that followed out in the parking lot in a "Jeepers Creepers" fashion:    LeeAnne and I are walking out in the dark, eerie parking lot. There is a fog lingering and something just doesn't feel right. We're walking towards my car and we can hear a car creeping up behind us. I keep walking as I see a van out of the corner of my eye. LeeAnne looks over to see a cute guy sitting in the front seat. But I sense something is wrong in the air. I can almost smell it. I finally look over at the van and then it happens.....  A HEAD POPS OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW....  WITH A HALLOWEEN MASK ON!!!!!!   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I freak out and walk frantically towards my car when I hear a voice come from the mask...  "How do you.....get to route 30?"        That's when I know we're DOOMED! So I run to my car and am fumbling with my keys to get in away from these "kidnappers" who are pretending to be "lost." And then I hear LeeAnne say, "Well just turn right out of here..." As I'm still struggling to grab the one key on my keychain to unlock my car. Meanwhile, the creeps in the van are steadily driving closer. I can feel them sensing my fear. LeeAnne is being drawn to them. She's about ready to invite them over for tea when I finally unlock my car and jump in. And that's when they drive off. LeeAnne hops in the car and I don't grind the gears as I pull out of the parking lot.   Talk about traumatic events! We went over her house for a while after that and just hung out. Saturday, I worked from 9-3, came home, slept for 3 hours, ate dinner, went to clean the office my mom and I clean every week, stopped at the coffee shop in Mifflin, came home, LeeAnne picked me up, went to bonfire at Morgan's house (where we witnessed flame-blowing people, whores, etc.), came back home, watched TV until 3 in the morning.      Whoops! Sorry, Craig!! (LOL)    Today: Brooke, Mom, and I went to the Columbus zoo. Then we went to Fazoli's, then came home. Brooke and I competed to see who could count the most of a certain type of vehicle. I was counting Hondas (HONDA!) and Brooke was counting sports cars. He gave up when I reached 152.  Oh... such fun!
