      So i asked someone tonight if he wanted to see the Bourne Supremacy with me and he says...Who else is going?!&nbsp;=O&nbsp;....what, I'm not good enough for you?&nbsp; geez, sorry i'm not as popular as you'd like me to be.&nbsp; It's like my friendship isnt enough, let alone my presence.&nbsp; a super ouch for me.&nbsp; it's ok, i'll live.&nbsp; in other events, i just took my second calc 3 exam and i think i failed this one too.&nbsp; i got a 35% on my first, i think i may have gotten the same.&nbsp; I'm dumb.&nbsp; But it's really getting me irritated seeing myself stare at something for hours and not understand it.&nbsp; I'm sick of being not smart.&nbsp; In other events, for the past 2 sundays i've attended CEMQ and i must admit that it seems to be promising in most areas.&nbsp; the people my age need to be more friendly as usual, but i like the fact that the pastor is a super Bible hardcore pastor and the congregation is very family based.&nbsp; I've been praying about uniting my family under one church and i can definitely see CEMQ as being that church.&nbsp; i think it's pretty messed up that my family goes to 3 different churches!&nbsp; we all should go to one, and I'm praying that God will answer this prayer quickly.&nbsp; So yeah...it's all just been calc 3, grace, CEMQ and ebay.&nbsp; thats about it.&nbsp; I've taken up the hobby of buying graded baseball rookie cards.&nbsp; i recently received A-rod's and barry bond's graded RC's, each BGS 8.5.&nbsp; I'm now trying to go for a Jeter GEM 10 RC and then resubmit to BGS and get a nice grade and then sell it.&nbsp; it may actually work and provide me with an extra flow of cash.&nbsp; It's 8 and it's time for me to pick up Grace from work.&nbsp; I'll talk about The American Dream next time.

      It's 3:15am and i can't sleep.&nbsp; I went to bed around 1:45am.&nbsp; I was online tonight and had nothing to do.&nbsp; Stan IM-ed me wanting to go to a cafe or something, but I wasn't feeling that.&nbsp; Grace wanted to go out but I guess I was being obnoxious, so we didnt go out.&nbsp; Then Doag IM-ed and wanted to play tennis.&nbsp; He was kidding but i said ok, and so we went to play at New Hyde Park for about an hour before it closed at 10.&nbsp; It was really nice there cause all the flood lights were on and there were a ton of people playing tennis, bball, and soccer.&nbsp; The whole park was pretty much alive and active.&nbsp; Doag wanted to try out his new raquet...it didn't seem much to me.&nbsp; He's mad good, but was being easy on me.&nbsp; But i impressed myself and was able to keep up with Joe for the most part.&nbsp; Just that I tired out in the last 10 mins.&nbsp; Then Grace called me afterward and she was pretty much silent...meaning she was upset at me for not wanting to bring her along.

      So today was Grace's first day on the floor as a real nurse on a 12-hour shift.  I picked her up after work and she was venting and crying at the same time.  She felt absolutely no support from her staff and she was she couldnt focus properly with her tasks.  Yet, with God's power she was able to get through the whole day in one piece.  I drove her home and we got into a small arguement about being encouraging and all that.  I was sorry, she was sorry...I prayed for her.  I know shes going to become a great nurse, but its going to take time and nothing will be perfect.  there is no such thing as a perfect day on the job.  Nonetheless I am still quite proud of my girlfriend.

      So i went to CT today for Sunday worship.  it was ok, but i was satified and content.  then played softball with Kelvin and some QCAC guys.  i caught some nice fly balls into the outfield, but i missed more than i should have.  yet, for playing for the first time this year, i think i played nicely and hit really nicely too.  grace came and we played tennis.  then we saw doag out in the grass sunbathing with his shirt off!! sick!!!  i played tennis with grace for 45 mins, and she really seemed to improve over night.  now she really wants to get into and be consistant and buy her own raquet.  yay.  then after doag came walking in and made me play him too.  joe's just too good, he wore me out.  way too powerful to me.  i was swinging blindly and just moving my arm without any power, but i held my own for the most part.  i was supposed to meet up with tim ip for dinner.  i got to grace's house a bit early and tim was gonna drive and pick me up for dinner, grace and i sat outside and talked.  she wanted me to go to a revival this coming weekend, but i refused.  we didnt get into an arguement, but i ended up telling her how important it is for me to unite my family through the same church...thats my spiritual goal now.  fortunately, grace understands that and i hope she'll help me pray about it.  so grace was happy that i'm gaining new ground in my spiritual life.  tim came and picked me up and we went to eat korean...for 90 mins!  all we talked about were our relationships with our girlfriends...and it was quite liberating to know that we actually have very similiar situations.  we talked a lot and i'm glad tim called me out...the guy is such a good boyfriend, much better than anything i'll become.  relationships are hard, but they're all worth it at the end.

      So i got fed up with all the repetative music that i listen to when i drive, so i bought 4 new CDs, one of which is the Switchfoot CD which has the song titled, We were meant for something more.  Stan says the group used to be Christian, but not anymore.  Nonetheless, the words to this and many of their other songs have very subtle, yet real Christian themes.  One of their other songs has the chorus go like..."are you who you wanna be?"  It's kinda weird cause for the past week, I've been asking myself if I've been living up to what God had planned for me, am i how God intended me to be.  Also, in retrospect to this past year in teaching, i think i have reflected enough to say that i had a great and fun year.  although i do not feel that i had acheived much with my students, i feel that i have acheived much with growing myself as a person and knowing more who God is.  i was a really bad teacher, and i plan on getting better at it, but just to look back at this past year, i feel very satisfied of the things that God allowed me to accomplish.  All of you knew that it was hard for me, for i rarely smiled genuinely, but now that i am able to finally step back and allow God to help me see things through His eyes, I am very happy with this past year, and I totally look forward to the challenges of my second year of teaching.  Tying back into the song i mentioned earlier, i believe i am somewhat close to who i wanna be, or rather who God wants me to be at this stage of my life.  i like, not love, being a teacher.  i'm sure i'll love it someday, but i am satisfied with just liking it right now.  as i am 23, i feel i am at a quarter-life revelation where God has been hitting me with the fact that life is so fragile and we only have one life to live.  how often to people really live out what they want to do or become?  especially if it is what God wants and intended?  very hard, but attainable with God's approval.  i always wanted to become a teacher since late high school, and i really can't believe that i am a real teacher today...all by God's grace and mercy.  now i want to do more.  but in God's timing, not mine...although i already have my heart set on another country in a few years down the road.  nonetheless, i am joyful knowing and believing that this is what God had intended me to do at this time in my life.  a lot of times i wonder to myself of what i could have done or become if i had done things differently.  if i had gone to a CUNY, pursued accounting, english, or seminary.  i believe deep down inside we all ask ourselves similiar questions...the possibilities are endless, yet we can only go in one direction at any given moment.  that's why we have to make perfect use of the time given to us (so says Gandalf).  live it up guys...do what you want to do, cause if you truely love God, what you want to do is really what He wants you to do.  in light of all this, i just want to thank my parents, grandparents, my sister, Grace, CT folks, the class of Bing '03, and everyone that i know for encouraging me and praying for me.  I declare that my first year of teaching was a team victory achieved through your prayers.  Thanks.

      Before that though, let me rewind to Thursday afternoon when I met up with my super old church friend from CEC, Cheryl Lee.  Since my car was at mobile, she came here to pick me up and then we drove to Forest Hills for some Ralphs Ice and B&N's time.  All we talked about was God.  She's going to China for missions next week for a whole year, and I mentioned that I always wanted to go to China.  Knowing that I was a math teacher, she said that her friend Alan Gong had just came back from teaching english in China to college students...all expenses paid!  WOAH!  That got me totally excited.  Plane trips, rent, and food are all paid for, plus a small salary.  She said that Alan had a wonderful time and that he found it easy to share his faith with his students since they want to always hang out with Americans to improve their english.  This got me thinking really hard about going to china.  I would first want to finish up my masters in 2 years, so if i were to go to China, i would have to go in 2 or 3 years.  But i was researching this a little more in depth and it seems like the salary is really small...i dont know if I can really make a living on this for a year and then pay for a wedding after i get back =P.  I dunno...it just sounds really cool, to go to china and get paid to teach english, and i dont even have to know chinese!  I shall really pray hard about this...i have 2 years to pray =P.  i mentioned this to gloria and she said she'll totally do it if i do it....nice!  So that was Thursday...Friday night Grace and I went to CT for the annual CT hofstra sharing time.  it was ok, but i knew i might get jealous hearing all the good things about the retreat.  then mike comes up to me afterward and says...yo, you would have loved the morning speaker, he was all about theology and very textbook oriented...ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  but it was cool cause i used the time to study for my final.  after fellowship, grace and i went to unos for some drinks and i felt that i really wanted to tell her that i am seriously considering going to china to teach english in 2 years.  i thought she would be excited since its like missions...but she wasnt X(.  maybe i should have prayed about it a little more before telling her.  i know she'll miss me, but its only for 8 months, just like another year in bing.  i dunno...i shall pray more about and see what God says.

      So i've finally discovered www.froogle.com froo·gle (fru'gal) n. Smart shopping through Google. i find this as helpful as ebay to determine the real market price of an item.  you just type in what item your looking for, like Alex Rodriguez rookie card, and then via the powers of google, it'll list the items, their descriptions, prices and pics if they have.  You can then re-arrange your listing from cheapest to priciest so that you can immediately find where to get the cheapest price at.  I find this much more convient than any of those price comparison websites.

      So i got my civic back.  The gas door and trunk release wire by the side of my driver seat was busted.  The new wire cost $35, but labor cost $95...$130!!!  Cars are just soooo stinkin expensive to use and maintain.  Grace will be over in about 30 mins from work.  We're gonna go to CT tonite cause its Hofstra sharing time.  They said that it was a much better retreat than last year.  That's why I didnt go last year, I didnt really get much out of it.  Maybe I'll go next year.  Cheryl's cousin, Joseph Tsang was the youth speaker.  He's mad good.  If CT gets him for college and career next year, I'll probably go.

      I've titled this as my first real blog because I feel that you can't really blog freely if you know that a bunch of your friends are really reading what you write.  The freedom ain't what it used to be on xanga.com.  Hopefully this can be my real personal journal that stays alive forever before Microsoft decides to eat up Google.

      So my impatience gets the worst of me once again tonight. I'm a really bad guy. No super hero here. And before everything happened, I told myself that I had a choice. When bad things happen that make us angry, before it can actually make us angry, we have a choice. The choice involves...how will we feel and react to the bad news, or whatever it is. How do I know we have a choice? Because there are millions of people out there, and if all experienced the saaaaaaaaame thing, i bet you'd get a million different reactions. Some sad, angry, mad, ambivalent, happy, joyful...the list goes on. My point being, when told bad news or experiencing something terrible, before we can react to it, we first have to decide how we will react and allow it to effects us. For instance...I got mad tonight cause someone was extremely late while i was waiting. Now, while waiting I told myself that I had a choice of either being mad, indifferent, or happy towards that person when I met up with him/her. Unfortunately I didnt think about my decision too much and I ended up getting impatient and angry. I just couldn't stop myself. I was hurt and it just wasnt fair. I feel like for the past year, I've been serving other people while it hasn't been reciprocated back to me. I know that's quite selfish of me to think like that, as if there has to be a balance between giving and receiving, that there has to be a fairness to life, but in the end that's what dictates many of our actions. but in the end, after all the sorries were dished out, God reminded me of His mercy and grace that I receive each day, yet how rebellious and selfish I always am. This thought has presently put me in a depressed state. I actually thought about suicide tonight. I tend to think about suicide maybe 5 times a year, but this summer I've thought about it a lot. People ask me how I am and I tend to say I'm alrite, but I suppose these days life is as tough as hell right now.

      I've recently concluded that I need more money.  My whole goal is to save up so that I can afford to get married, buy a house, and have kids.  But I don't have the discipline to save so much.  I've recently renewed my interest in baseball cards, and I've spent a couple of hundred of dollars on buying cards on ebay.  I've also resorted to selling more stuff too, in particular my whole vhs anime collection and 50 image comics from the old days.  I dont have any bidders right now, but hopefully someone will bite.  I definitely spend too much money.  I've been cleaning my room and I'm finding so many useless things.  Plus I eat out way too much.  I justify this by saying that I don't make much money in the first place, so it's hard for me to save.  I just love collecting stuff.  Oh yeah, my car insurance bill came this month...$600 for six months.  Totally insane.  I've had my car for 3 years and I've spent $3,600 so far on insurance.  And what has that insurance bought me so far? NOTHING!  Insurance is the city's way of labeling drivers as suckers.  Why can't I take the chance and drive on my own without insurance?  Why must there be a law stating that I need car insurance?  Money...this is why the first letter of the word 'Money' is capitalized in one of the Gospels...Jesus labels money as an idol...a powerful idol.
