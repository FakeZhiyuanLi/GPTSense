      Today was one of those days where nothing realli is going on and it's not a good day and it's not a bad day, it's kinda in-between, and it's not like im feeling anything inside of me either which is weird cuz im usually happi or depressed or just like "whatever", but today im kinda not feeling anything inside, it's like i know it doesnt make sense cuz it doesnt make sense to me either but it's one of those feelings where it's not realli a feeling, it's more like there's nothing realli going on inside of you to make you happi, or upset, or angry, or anything like that, i know it's confusing but basically one way to explain it is that im not realli feeling anything good or bad right now, it's just nothing...

      WHEW! DRILL TEAM IS GONNA BE HOT! I havent' made the team yet but im praying and i mean PRAYING that im gonna make it cuz i realli dont think anyone understands how much i love to DANCE! it's just a feeling i get when i dance, and it's a great feeling and you just feel the music and let loose of all your worries and thoughts and stuff that stresses you out and just DANCE UR BUTT OFF! i love dancing to hip-hop and hindi or any kind of dance at all! the try-outs for drill team are tomorrow and im so nervous because you gotta go in alone in front of judges who you dont know and just dance! but im gonna do the best i can tomorrow cuz i wanna make it so badly, because dancing is the only thing im realli realli good at and i know that if i do make it (which hopefully i will) that i would work my butt off every SINGLE PRACTICE AND THAT'S A PROMISE! i love the songs, i love everything about drill team! so basically it's like this...I LOVE TO DANCE!...

      wow, this school year has gone by so fast and yes it had it's bad days and yes it had it's good days but i'll miss every moment, every fight, every laughter, every smile, every assignment, every class, every person, and mostly everything! this was my freshman year in highschool and everyone told me that freshman year was the greatest! and i used to hate it in the beginning but the more i got into it the more i loved it! and i love everything about it! i loved every moment and mostly because i met someone who will change my life forever...and that person made such a difference in my life that i will never forget it and i will always remember one thing that the person gave me...happiness. Something i havent had in a long long long time and whenever i was with that person, i felt like i was on top of the world and i felt so alive and free and i just wish i could tell that person how much i care about them but i cant...and i cant because i screwed everything up within 5 seconds...all it took was 5 seconds and my happiness went down the drain...now, i remember when i told everyone that i will be happi and i wont ever be depressed anymore and im not depressed, im just having one of those days where it's good and bad but right now im feeling so upset and heartbroken about this that i cant help but to cry and beg god to let that person feel the same way i feel and pray that i wont be hurt anymore than i already have been, i just wish god could tell that person somehow in someway that im sorri...im truly very sorri...and i wish we could start over, plz?...

      This is pretty much everything that's going on with me right now, like me and my "lil" dilemma with someone and it sucks but im trying not to let it get me down so here is the poem...  I loved you unconditionally But you never loved me back I was waiting for you to love me But love is what you lacked  I dreamt of us together And wondered if you did the same And kept wishing maybe one day You'll stop these childish mind games  Now I don't know what to say Or where to start Because I never dreamed You'd be the one to be my break my heart  I won't think of the good times Or the way you made me feel I'll just forget it all And go to someone whose love is real  The memory of your kiss Will soon be gone And I won't have to wonder anymore If we could've belonged  I say this right now Wishing it was all true But the fact of the matter is Tonight, I'll go to bed and cry over you...
