      Well, there are about ten million things on my mind right now that I would like to vent about and get off my chest, so many things have happened and keep happening, kind of like a big old train that keeps picking up passengers but never lets any off.  Just in the last two days I could fill up like 15 posts, but what I wanna do is talk about my son, Joey.  A little bit of feel good stuff for today.  My husband and I tried to get pregnant for two years and then decided to go to the doctors and see if they could help.  We went through all the icky tests and a couple months of charting and after finding it wasn't Joe (my hubs) or anything physically wrong with me, I was put on Clomid.  I was on Clomid for six months and each month if I was late I would call the doc and the first thing he would tell me is to take a pregnancy test, they were always negative and very very heartbreaking.  Well on the sixth month visit, he said that if I wasn't pregnant this month he would have to refer me to a specialist.  Oh, I forgot to mention how baby sex is not that much fun after six months, every other day, whether we felt like it or not.  Anyway, I was late again and so decided to go ahead and do the pregnancy test before calling since they always told me to anyway, I had already convinced myself that Clomid just wasn't gonna do it, so I wasn't going to be devestated this time.  And lo and behold there it was, the two beautiful pink lines.  I couldn't believe it, it had to be a mistake, I woke Joe up and made him go get another one and there it was again.  I was actually pregnant.  It was an amazing feeling.  Joe cried, I cried and went out and bought a little pair of shoes.   I immediately started to worry about all the things that could happen or that I would go to the doctor and they would say I wasn't really pregnant, it was at my first doctors appointment that my baby really became my baby to me, I heard the heartbeat of my son. I'll finish later, gettin a little long.

      I'm beginning to realize I'm the most pessimistic person ever. (well, not ever)  I used to have a saying when I was younger that if I expect the worst I can't be disappointed but I'm finding now that that's just wrong.  If the worst happens I'm still dissappointed, I think by being pessimistic or what I call prepared, I may actually be setting myself up to fail.  Maybe I actually am creating "the worst"  Am I afraid to succeed, I don't think so, but I'm learning a lot of new things that I didn't think were possible.    I always thought that if I could think of every possible outcome, mostly bad, or any possible scenario and plan for it then I would be ok, but I'm not ok.  I actually believe that I have trained my brain to accept the sucky.  The worst part is that I'm miserable in most situations, the only way I can be happy it seems is if every thing goes exactly the good way, and there is so many more bad ways, it makes the odds totally against my happiness and peace.    Honestly though, how do you shut that off.  For 34 years I've been nervous and scared and pessimistic.  How do I step over that line of change.  From old patterns of thinking to new, from sad to happy, from scared to brave, from annoyance to compassion, from worry to faith, from losing to winning, from clumsy to graceful, from frustration to peace, from weak to stonge,  from just getting by to being genuinely free to succeed in my life.  If I find out, I'll let ya know.  I just want to erase all the fear and hurt and anxiety from my head.  One thing goes wrong and it snowballs from there and I think of everything and I do mean everything that I've ever been afraid of or nervous about or was unfair in my life, past and present.  It won't be easy, I wish there was a switch to just shut those feelings off for awhile so I have a chance to regroup when something goes wrong, then I can break the viscious circle of glum.  I can keep my mouth shut when I'm sad or afraid or annoyed or frustrated because I don't want to make anyone else miserable but I know that it comes out in other ways.    I don't think faking is an option, I want to really feel it, feel what it's like not to be overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty and to accept what comes with the faith that God only knows, and he's a lot smarter than me.    I heard today a little tidbit I'm going to try to remember,  "It could all come crashing down on my head, but it could turn out to be really great"  If I have the worst in my head constantly how am I even giving the good possibilities a chance.  And also would I even know, or would I just find something bad in it.  I can look back on everything in my life good and bad and see something good that came out of every situation, what I would like to learn to do is to be able to see the good in the present as well.  Putting it that way, it doesn't sound to hard.  Peace,  Jen

        Ok, well. Here goes.  This could be interesting.  I read about this in the paper.  Thought I'd give it a shot.  Today was a quiet day, Thank God.  Today is my Saturday, I work Wednesday through Sunday, so Monday is fun cleaning house day and also tryin to catch up on some much needed rest.  I try to stay in the house as much as possible, it's my safe place, I don't have to worry about much, other people mostly.  I avoid the phone and skip the mailbox, just need peace.  I did have to run some errands, but mostly just hung out on puter.  I feel a little guilty since I didn't do much else, but I got to catch up on a lot of stuff I've been wantin to do.  My 18 mile long project list will still be there unfinished as it has been since I was 5, only it wasn't quite as long or involved.    Right now I'm just trying to block out all the worry, bills, my son, the future, my sisters and brothers, my mom bein mad at me.  I just know that nothin can touch me right now, didn't even put make up on today, which is like huge for me, (you know, just in case someone stops by) not that I would've answered the door.    well, gonna go eat some chocolate and continue trying to relax.  I'll try to write some more interesting stuff later.  Sometimes boring is just what I need.  Excitement can be extremely draining.    Later,

      When we first heard the heartbeat, it was amazing.  It was so fast, but seemed so tiny.  It was finally so real.  The doctor thought there might be twins, so he ordered an ultrasound.  My hubs and I were both so excited, we could barely contain ourselves till the ultrasound.  Joe was a little hesitant about the twin thing but I thought it would be kinda cool.  Finally the day arrived, and we saw our little Joey right there on the screen.  At the time we worked at the factory that makes Gummi Bears in Iowa and I swear my son looked like a little Gummi Bear, and yep only one.  At first I just knew he was a girl ( you couldn't tell on the ultrasound, it was a little early), everyone else just knew it was a girl including my mom's psychic.  The only one that didn't think so was Joe.  So for he first seven months of pregnancy, I called my son Nina (our girl name).    I felt him move for the first time at 14 weeks, it was the coolest, weirdest feeling ever.  It was amazing, that little teeny tiny critter was movin around, gettin all comfy.  Everything went along pretty smoothly, I never got sick.  I was pretty small though so my hips were not too thrilled, I could almost feel them expanding to make room.  The only real significant thing about my pregnancy was that I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, that was kinda scary for a bit.  Aside from having to do those nasty glucose tests, the worst part was not knowing, I had never heard of it before.  I did a lot of research and testing, everything I was sposed to do and was able to control it with diet, which was nice, no insulin.  The lack of sugar and chocolate kinda took it's toll on me though.    I craved milk and watermelon, I mean tons.  A gallon of milk every two days and at least a watermelon every three.  Joey loves watermelon to this day, favorite food.  I got the heartburn, sittin up sleepin for the last 3 months only helped a little with that.  I got the leg cramps, ugh, when the first one hit me,  I couldn';t believe how much that hurt, eek.  Finally figured out how to ease those.  The only thing I really worried about with him was how big he was gonna be.  Apparently with gestational diabetes, babies tend to be big, and.......Joe was 11 pounds and his brother 12 when he was born, so being small I was pretty worried about that.  The "What to expect" book was my bible.  I wrote little letters to my baby and wrote down all the little funny feelings and researched every little thing and played him music, and sang to him.  I enjoyed being pregnant very much and hopefully I'll get to feel that again.  I would not trade it for the world.  It amazed me that this little thing moving and growing inside of me was something that was created from two microscopic little things, and now had a heart and fingers and fingernails and eyes and a mouth and ears, amazing.  It still amazes me.  That our bodies, that God, that love, is capable of this.  A baby is truly truly a miracle,  I really wish everyone felt that way.  All those unwanted babies, I would give anything to carry them myself.  I loved Joey from the time I knew I was pregnant, actually from the time I knew I wanted to be a mother, I knew he would be in my life someday,  in God's time.  It's hard to be patient, but I was and what a gift I was given.    OK, next post will probably be kind of graphic but I'll continue later.
