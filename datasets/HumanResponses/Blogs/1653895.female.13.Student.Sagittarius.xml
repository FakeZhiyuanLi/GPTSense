        dude i totaly understand why people write in these things. to say what they're thinking without bugging the shit out of people. i mean i dont even care if people read it, i just like writing in it. i mean i have alot to say and if people care, they can read it, n if they dont, they wont. i mean this is my 6th blog in 2 days. woah. ya know, at mayorga we were talking about abortion. i think that people should be able to have an abortion if they want to. it is none of anyone elses business.  yeah.

        today was very blah.  revalation time: some people live these great lives ya know? like living in wonderful places, traveling all the time, not worrying about money.  and they have fun and cool lives and love it. and then there are the people, who sit at home all the time or somtimes hang out with friends, but arent like reeeeeeally good at anything but not reeeeeally bad at anything. and they're pretty bitchy sometimes, partially because they are always being called a bitch. so there lives, compared to the rich swiss people are kinda sucky. but not realllly good n not reeeeeeeally bad. now shouldnt the cool rich traveling people share some of the fun.

        yesterday was a bad day. i woke up n had to go to a bad batmitzvah. n there was a lunch thing. but we didn't go. then my mom yelled at me that it was my fault even though my dad was the one who didnt want to go. it was stupid. n then i had to do some stupid stuff. n rosie came over at 9:30 and we were supposed to go to aprils at 10:30 but they didn't call or anything. and then my dad got reeeeeeeeeeeeeally mad for making him stay up till 11:45 to drive us over there. but then april called saying that even though sarah could sleep over, well all couldn't. and then my dad yelled at me some more. and i went to bed.

        yesterday was ok cuz it was friday and me n sarah had good french food. but also we got our high school registration forms which means this hell hole called middle school is almost over which makes me quite happy. and i dont want to take connections. you'd think that after 3 years preparing for high school and being in all GT that we'd know how to do our homework and take notes. maybe not. my batmitzvahs in a month. great except not.  well seeing as my life is so facinating...  i think i will go now

        well today everyone was all excited cause they got into CAP. and its gunna be "like totally awesome!" me rosie and april went to Panera. and it was ok. it would have been good if april and rosie didn't talk about how excited they were to get into CAP. and how it's gunna suck cuz Breton didn't get in. but it doesn't matter that i didn't. cause as everyone knows "i'm a bitch who's not good at anything" and we went to april's with dylan and breton.  it was cool minus the banging my head into the floor. and the bitching of my mom. and everyone's like "this is the best day ever!" but it wasn't

        YAYE! the beach rocked so much! camping was cool although i don't think i could do it for more than like 2 days. so here's how it went:      Friday:      we went to se the rear window con sarah april rosie dylan y breton. Then us chicks went to aprils and the dudes went somewhere else. Then they came over till 11. Then it was off to bed at around 12 cause we had to get up at 7.     Saturday:      We woke up at 7, got dressed, packed, etc. then we were off at about 8:15. So we drove for about 3 hours, got to Asateague, set up camp (me, A, S, and R got a 6 person tent!) and went to the beach where we got tan/burnt/swam in the ice cold water. Then we went back, ate dinner, watched the sunset, and went for a walk on the beach. oh! there were horses! lots and lots of them! which means shitloads of shit. it was pretty gross. but that's ok. so we went back and went to sleep.      Sunday:      We got up at like 8 and ate breakfast and got paked and stuff. Then we went to the beach just to hang out cause we didnt want to go in the car all gross. but then, like 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave, we realized that there were showers. So we all went in the water and it was much fun! then it was off to eat and go home  To anyone still reading this: GET A LIFE what are you doing still reading about my weekend? you must really love me! or are just bored probably the latter.  bye
