       urlLink    This is part of the grounds at the Hilton--it's just humongous and so beautiful. There are really nice walking paths with hammocks along the way strung between palm trees where you can just relax for a bit or take a nap.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    There is a boat you can take to get to your room, or you can take the train. This is the boat going by the tower that my room was in.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Our first evening there, we went to a little grocery shopping near the hotel area (Waikoloa Village) and had our dinner outside with this view!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    After my initial shock over Waikoloa Village wore off, Kim and I went the next morning to the volcano. We saw the crater (much smaller than Ngorongoro, but still cool!) and we drove down to the area with the freshest lava where you can hike around on it.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is the flow from last year where it covered more of the road! The other side is completely blocked off by years of lava.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    We saw lots of different fish, including the humuhumunukunukuapua'a fish ( ridiculously  hard to photograph because they're elusive and very speedy). Luckily, yellow tangs were abundant and apparently slow-moving.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The next day we woke up butt early for the race (2:15 am)! I stopped on the race course to pose for a picture. I think this is at about mile 3 or 4.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    After we went back to the hotel, I was exhausted though it was only about 10 or 11 am! I took a nap and then did some snorkeling in the lagoon at the Hilton where I met this puffer fish.&nbsp; urlLink
