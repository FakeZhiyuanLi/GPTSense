      Hey, switch to broadband! You'll never regret it! It's getting cheaper and cheaper these days...I came home before 7 pm today! The train was so uncrowded, not empty, just uncrowded. Does that make sense? I suppose it does. How's Drama Feste rehearsals coming along? Need more crew? Haha...have fun all those involved. So are we having OG outing this weekend?

      waaaaaaahahahahaha!!! rejoice my loveliess for i have braved many odds to get to this page. first my uber-slow 56k modem acts up, then my screen turns lime green and then my fossilised computer conks out on me too! wunderbar. im VERY HIGH right now. in fact, i think i will never really touch alcoholic drinks, since i get so high without a spot of liquor in my blood anyway. heavens know what'll happen if i get really intoxicated. actually, i did, once. but it was not-so-nice cos i got the most hellish headache the next day. all you pro-partyers out there are probably shaking your head and going "tsktsk, vaish's -such- an amateur" right? hrmph. yesterday i got home before sunset. it was the second time in the year already! notbad notbad :D four more times and i'll break last year's record. i never even realised what my estate looks like in the sunlight! im still REALLY HIGH. and happy. and HIGH.    and i'll wish on a star that somewhere you are thinking of me too   good nite dear jeffies =)

      Argh, it dawned on me in the car that I can't go for the frisbee tournament tomorrow, because I'll be having French then! I can't play truant, because if you do it once, they tell the school. You do it twice, they suspend you for a week. Push your luck one more time, and they'll suspend you indefinitely! So good luck and have fun! Maybe I'll come look for you during dinner...

      I bought $20 worth of coupons, then nobody would reply to my sms-es when I asked them if they were going, so I went home. Sigh, then I gave them to my parents who went instead. Kind of stupid right? Haha, who went to Drama Feste? Saw quite a few people from our OG acting, but the funniest was that Wei Han! It was so...him...

      hah sorry for always posting lyrics :D   Uninvited   Like anyone would be  I am flattered by your fascination with me  Like any hot blooded woman  I have simply wanted an object to crave  But you, you're not allowed  You're uninvited  An unfortunate slight   Must be strangely exciting  To watch the stoic squirm  Must be somewhat heartening  To watch shepard meet shepard  But you, you're not allowed  You're uninvited  An unfortunate slight   Like any uncharted territory  I must seem greatly intriguing  You speak of my love like  You have experienced love like mine before  But this is not allowed  You're uninvited  An unfortunate slight   I don't think you unworthy  I need a moment to deliberate

      Not just her, a lot of the other people also haven't accepted the invitation. Including Wei Han, which probably explains why this place is so quiet. Haha...go to Gabriel's house! Then when we play mahjong, you can see Alina lose again. ;-) Let's go cycling if we're going to Pasir Ris Park. What about dinner on Friday?

Please die Ana For as long as you're here we're not You make the sound of laughter and sharpened nails seem softer And I need you now somehow And I need you now somehow   Open fire on the needs designed On my knees for you Open fire on my knees desires What I need from you   Imagine pageant In my head the flesh seems thicker Sandpaper tears corrode the film   And I need you now somehow And I need you now somehow   Open fire on the needs designed On my knees for you Open fire on my knees desires What I need from you   And you're my obsession I love you to the bones And Ana wrecks your life Like an anorexia life   Open fire on the needs designed On my knees for you Open fire on my knees desires What I need from you Open fire on the needs designed Open fire on my knees desires On my knees for you   -ana's song [silverchair]

      I redesigned our OG blog, so at least it has more than one colour! (No, white doesn't really count as a second colour...) Anyway, my keyboard's back to normal, Shafia. It's some screwed up language setting, stupid American software. It won't let me use British English as the default language for the whole computer. All of a sudden, it just dawned on me last night that the problem lay there. So I fixed it. Oh, I've added a shoutbox too, for those of you who are in a hurry, or who aren't in the blog yet. (Why aren't you?!) Enjoy what's left of our holidays, study hard!

      Hi! My modem was screwing up, so I've been offline until today. Now my keyboard's gone mad too, so some of the keys have decided to swap positions. I think one pair didn't even swap the upper-case and lower-case characters together! If anyone can figure out what's wrong, tell me! Should I just reinstall the OS?

      ohmygoddddddddd wasn't bio just horrific?? like the mcqs were fine and gave me false hope that the rest would be manageable but NOOOOOOO. first structured question just HAD to be on MICROSCOPY, which they KNOW noone will study for. and what a perfect time to FORGET the stupid names of the things in centrifugation! centrifugation! what a blastedly long and unnecessary word! and! GUESS who, wrote phloem initially (presumably the correct answer) but CHANGED it! changed it! that's right. ME. oh man. oh PLUS, the rj bio dept has like little to NO grammar skills so the questions were stupidly phrased too. GLOOOOOp. that's me drowning in my sorrows. haha. ok that didn't even sound right. bio makes people incoherent. boohoo. hahahaha. good luck for math. and.. any other papers. haha. today has just been traumatising.

      I don't think my CT is ever going to give back our academic reports. Haha, not like I mind. (Not that I should mind!) Anyway, how's life now? Hope you're all having fun, except when you're having SPAs. I'm starting to get bored of school. Shafia, I've skipped PE twice already! Was a good boy and went for Ms Poon's fitness group today. Actually, she's quite nice.
