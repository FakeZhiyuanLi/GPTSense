      I'm at the gaming cafe with no games to play. So...updating my blog sounded like a reasonable way to kill the rest of my computer time. Who cares? My brother payed for it. I found some kick ass pictures of Jesus on google, for some reason. This guy beside me keeps on calling me godboy. I guess I'm the athiest godboy. That's it. Screenname change.  if bStevegod then showmessage ('I am changing my screenname to Athiest Bible humper'); end   You know what?  I miss programming class. What the fuck?  Whatever. I got ot see Hillary today, which was alright. We played truth or dare wit hJoel and Jacquie for a bit. I was dared to french her, so it was a good game. Well, that's about it for today, so..well..  -Adios  -Steve

      I updated my other blog way more often.. Here's a little thingie that I got off My's blog. Taking random quizzes is always a good waste of time.              FIRE OF EARTH. Good with business. You'd be good as a stock broker, physicist, mathematician, scientist or professor. You value stability and material security, but aren't likely to be greedy. You're pretty much set in your ways and can be stubborn. You are extremely reliable and stable. People like you because you can be counted on. You tend to be pragmatic and favor solutions/principles that have already been established rather than ideas that haven't had their day in court. You're also way to sexy for your own good. Steve, you sexy sexy bitch.              urlLink Quiz  created by  urlLink Polly Snodgrass .        Not much happening, either. I'm in a fucking great mood today, so I guess that's what's happening. It doesn't happen often enough for it to be ignored. I downloaded a whole bunch of songs today. Lots by Jethro Tull. Anyone who has the means, I highly suggest burning a Jethro Tull cd. (or buying one, although they're uber old) Well, that's pretty much it.  Adios,  -Steve

      I wasn't on the computer five minutes, this morning, when I was IMed by Caleb, a friend of mine. He broke up with his online girlfriend a while ago. Actually, she broke up with him. The whole situation is iffy, you know? After they broke up, Caleb told me and my other friend Joel about how she still treats him and calls him her boyfreind. I approached her with this and she said he hadn't even talked to her since they broke up.   I don't really want any part in this, but I got that IM from Caleb this morning. He asked me to ask Maggs some questions. And use my "master persuaion and perception" to figure out what's going on with her. So I told him no way. But I want to help him out still. I feel like I'm betraying him by not doing this..Maggs has been acting differently lately.   Also, I'm sick of people. I have somewhat of a social life, but I'd prefer not to. As in: I have people who follow me around, and won't leave me alone. It's slowly depleating though, as when I graduated grade eight, I could count all of my good friends on two hands, and now I can only count them on one. Not counting the five to ten morons who just won't leave me alone. And I'm sick of them. All of them. They're all the kind of people to say what they're told to say, and like..Think what they think it would be cool to think, and buy what they're told to want. It drives me crazy. One of them came to my house yestarday without calling or anything. I wouldn't have been furious on two conditions..  a) My mom wasn't in an extremely horrible mood b) it wasn't Sean.  That guy..Oh, I'm not going to get started on him. Maybe later I'll dedicate a whole post to him, or something. Not right now.  Wherever I stand right now..I'm fucking fed up with everything. Thankfully I'm not depressed, (not going there again) but it looks like I could be heading there.   Hillary might be coming today. My girlfriend. Maybe I'll dedicate a whole post to her later too, but not now. She lives in town, but she's on the outskirts. And since I'm not quite 16 yet, (40-something more days!) I don't have a car. So I only get to see her once a week or so. She doesn't go to my school, either. Gah, because she's in grade eight. Whatever. I'm in grade ten. Not that big of an age difference.  I'm about done posting..Might post later today, but I seriousely doubt it.   The reason I have this blog is because I don't want to be fake anymore. I have another blog, (http://www.livejournal.com/users/plouder95/ Don't bother reading it, it may be funny, but it's phony as hell) But it's fake. I act all cheery, and all of that all the time. I piss myself off. Maybe I'm just tired.  Adios,  -Steve

      This is my first post. As in, the  only  post so far. As in..  To make this any clearer, I guess I would need crayons..  Anyhow, there isn't much to say at present, so I guess it's  -Adios  -Steve
