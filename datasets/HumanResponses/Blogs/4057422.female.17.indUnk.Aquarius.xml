        Today was just splendid. Once again woke up at 7 o clock to go to the Freshmen back to school day. Wow. It was once again absolutely pointless-so I left at 10 once again to sleep. I was so exhausted. Then I woke up and went to work at about 4. Then i worked till 10. Wow-my day was just super, eh? So I get the mail today, and theres this letter in there from Edison Community College (where I am taking dual enrollment classes) saying that my registration is not fully completed. "Hmmm....", I say. So I call them to find out how in the hell I am not completely registered when I did everything my guidance counciler told me to do-but of course the college is closed for the day. Ummm dont send me freakin cards saying I am not fully registered and then be closed when I want to find out how that is possible! GRR! I hate schools they are so retarded. I am angered. But anyways, right about now I should be going to see Cam since it is his last night in Florida, but one person is preventing me to do that. I am very sad since Cam is a very cool guy who I instantly got along with very well. Gosh golly. I think I am going shopping with Sean tomorrow, but I must not buy anything. I have spent way to much money lately. Oh well-hopefully tomorrow will be a little more exciting than today. I want this shirt from Abercrombie (it is silly) haha.

       Well...the day started out with a bit of Freshmen back to school day stuff. It was lame and boring, so I went home and slept. Then I had to go to work where I worked very hard (lol). Then I proceeded to go to Gavins to pick up Cam!! We met Scott and Coyt at McDonalds (the cool kid meeting spot) and drove out to Josh's (and AUDRAS!!) It was great fun. It took us like forever to get there (we were out in the BFE as Scott put it). We chilled there for a while and then it was time to leave. This is where I get lost. See, I was driving-minding my own business-when Cam says Nicole turn here. So me being the no sense of direction person that I am says okay and turns. Well we hit some area that I've never seen and I get very scared and beg Cam to call Jess and figure out where the hell we are. "No Nicole, calm down we are fine I know where we are" says Cam (the kid from Michigan who in all reality had NO IDEA where we were). So finally I take control of the situation, call Audra and arive safely back in Estero Florida. WOOO!!! That was my very eventful, very fun night. I had quality bonding time with Cam lol. He is a very cool kid who I will miss very much when he goes back :( Well now I must go to sleep because I have to once again get up at 7 for Freshmen back to school crap. Goodnight sirs.

        Wow. What a freakin long day. Yes indeedy. It all started at 9:30. I went to get a haircut....this was interesting as always since I feel that I may never leave the salon with the same haircut that I went in with. We switched it up a bit-takin a bit of time to get used to but I like it. Then I proceeded to go to hell...or work that is. I hated it. It was hot, boring, and long. The only good thing is that Audra and I closed footwear together, so thats always interesting-nevermind the fact that we got yelled at by our manager for "making his job difficult." Eh, shove it. Anyway...got off work and met Cam, Gav, Brian, and that whole crew at the movies. Whoever decided we should go see The Bourne Supremacy should be eaten by an alligator. It sucked majorly. I decided it sucked 5 mins into the movie, so I felt this would be a good sleeping oppurtunity-that is untill Cam figured out my ingenious plan and continued to poke me throughout the rest of the movie. It sucked. So yea, that was my day. Very uneventful considering 7 hours of it were consumed by hell, Nike that is. Now I must go get some sleep considering I have to get up at 7 in the freakin morning. Yup, 7. I have to go to the Freshmen back to school day and help out or somethin. Im so nice. lol Goodnight everyone. (P.S.-I got to use my new purse for the first time today. I am so in love....)

       Hello ladies and gentlemen!! Well to start this baby off, I am making one of these things (that I often made fun of) because Glenn said I should....so I am. I guess that would mean I am easily influenced. But anyways, I guess I will tell you about my day. First and foremost, I took Glenny Poo to the airport cuz he left me today :(...I had fun with him and this winter he will teach me to ski! I am excited!!!! Then Katie and I proceeded to go to Target where we bought really cute school supplies. We bought folders, binders, book covers, and pencils that all had matching flowers on them. It was very 3rd grade. We opted not to buy any flowered folders for our dual enrollment classes at the college however, because we figured the older people who take that class may make fun of us. lol. Then we went to her house where we spent the next 6 freakin hours making up our powderpuff cheerleading routine. I have one thing to say-our boys are gonna freakin rock once again and will most definetely win first place AGAIN (regardless of what evil Justin says...) I would also like to say that next year, I believe I am Estero High Schools slave. I will only be going to school for 5 periods a day and for 2 of those periods I am an aide....hmmmm I think they are tricking me by calling me and aide when really I am just a SLAVE!!! I am very bored this evening however, because I was SUPPOSED to go to the movies with Cam, but he opted to go with Gavin to Josh's. Sean is also mad at me, just cuz I said he was annoying me with his comments about me not talking on the phone for 4 hours at a time. UGH! Men! They make no sense whatsoever. I am very aggravated. The world would be a much better place if we could move all men underground and bring them up strictly for breeding purposes. A cookie to whoever can name the TV show that is from. You know what song I have had in my head for like 50 days now? Do the rockaway! And lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I have started listening to freakin rap. That is to be blammed on Glenn, since that is all I heard for the past 12 days. And I hate to admit it, but I actually like it. Thats so lame. I miss New Jersey :( Its so nice there and theres actually THINGS TO DO. How cool is that? I go back to work tomorrow. I have not worked in 2 weeks. I am not looking forward to it AT ALL. I hate work and everyone that works there. Work is sooo much drama. You go to high school and deal with stupid high school drama all day and then you think you can go to work and just work? NOPE. WRONG. You go to work and deal with more stupid drama. It never ever ever stops. However, I am happy right now cuz I bought a really cute purse yesterday. Its the white Dooney and Bourke purse and it is my new love. Glenn made me sit down for 5 mins and think about what I was buying, and I decided that I was definetely in love. It is very cute and makes me happy. I believe I have a purse obsession and also a very large lacking of self control. Oh well. I would marry it if I could. Okay Im out like a girl scout.

       Hello! I just got home from Katies. I will start with yesterday! Katie and I went to my doctors appointment (she came along for moral support lol) where I was given antibiotics for my ear infections, and Allegra for these damn allergies. (I should be a doctor since I called that!) Then we went to Beefs and had wings and then on to the scrapbook store for hours and hours of fun! Then we went to Tony's sauna (or his house....but sauna since he still had no power) and hung out with him and Scott for a little bit. After that I went to mi casa and talked to the mother for a few before going back to Katies to stay the night! Her, Scott, and I went to eat at Outback since Tony was working and we conspired to leave our table really messy since he has to clean it but it didnt work out as planned because we are such good friends. lol. After that fun, the three of us went and layed in Katies room waiting for Tony to get off. We were very bored but entertained ourselves with silly stories. Tony finally got off but then they went back to Scotts house. Kaite and myself then stayed up till 5 in the freakin morning workin on our scrapbooks! But so far they are really cute! Then this morning, we went to Edison to get our books-for real we went this time lol. The books are really cute but we felt like lost Freshmen trying to find them. Then, at the checkout line they had these Spongebob Square Pants box things. One said "For Her" and the other said "For Him." They were these college kid campus things, and on the side in really small letters it said (Not suitable for children). We so desperately wanted to know what was in them and they were free, but we were scared to take them! We believe there were condoms and things of that sort in there! LoL! So that was my day so far! Might go to Scotts with Tony in a few so I must go! I shall update later! Goodbye chillens!   OH! And by the way! They BIGGEST spider EVER was just in my dining room and I had to drown it in bug spray. It was the scariest moment of my life. Goodbye.

      After A while  After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul, And you learn that love doesnt mean leaning and company doesnt mean security, And you begin to learn that kisses arent contracts and presents arent promises, And you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open, with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child, And you learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans. After a while your learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much. So plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure. . . that you really are strong, and you really do have worth. And you learn and you learn. . . with every good-bye you learn. . .

        Hello! My comcast has been off and on for these past two days, but looks like I'm back in business! I guess I will start updating you with yesterday! Well, I awoke to a call from Katie asking me to accompany her to the mall-so I did. We went to Coastland and hit up Hollister. They had some cute new stuff in and I was pleased-and I bought some really cute stuff! Abercrombie however, was rather dissapointing. Eh. I got an AWESOME new poster. You see, what happened, was that Katie and I went into the poster shop to look at which posters we would be putting in our apartment (when we get it Sophomore year of college-thats a bit of pre-planning eh?), when I came across the most awesome OC poster ever! It has Marissa, Ryan, Summer, and Seth just chillin and Seth (the man I will marry) is looking as beautiful as ever! And it was only $7.99 so I couldn't pass up this wonderful piece of art. It is now hanging on the wall opposite my other poster of Seth and I believe I am beginning to look a little obsessive but oh well. While looking in the poster store-I recieved a call from Scott. So I answer by saying "Hello, sir." He then asks "Where are you?" "At the mall," I reply. "Where are you?," I then ask. "Me and Tony are at your house," he says. I find this humorous and tell them to hang tight, I shall arrive shortly. So I got back to my house and Scott, Tony, and I spent a lovely late afternoon swimming in my pool. Scott made my hot tub overflow, made comments about my pictures hanging on the wall, and then I joined their "fight club" because I'm a soldier. We talked about silly stuff and then it was time for Tony to go home (or to Scott's home, since Tony still doesnt have power) and get ready for dinner. Then I hung out for a while and watched Shark Attack, Shark Attack 2, and right in the middle of Shark Attack 3-Katie calls to say she will be over shortly. So her, Scott, and Tony all come back over and we hang out and talk about silly things for a while. Tony ate my double-stuffed oreos and tried to steal them-but thats okay because oreos are kind of gross anyway! Oh! And guess what? We DONT go back to school on Thursday like we were supposed to. We are now MAYBE going back on Monday. This sucks. Not only did this hurricane mess up homes and lives, but now it is preventing me from ever graduating. I just want to go to school and get it over with! By the time we go back it will be like the first freakin day all over again! So we all talked about that for a while and then Tony and Scott left. That is all. Thats the end of the night. It was a fun-filled day though I must say. Oh, and Starbucks coffee at the Promenade is freakin free! I mean what is better than free Starbucks Mocha Frappacinos?! I dont know why its free, but I'm not questioning such a beautiful thing. Today will not be so fun-filled I dont believe. At 11:30 I have to go see my doctor and I am scared because I am going by myself. My throat is killing me and now I think I have an ear infection too. Im scared to go. Then Katie and I have to go to Edison and get our books so we can learn. Blah Blah Blah! Oh well. Maybe we can find a way to insert some fun into our day. Maybe we will meet Scott and Tony at the beach. Who knows really? Alright kids-goodbye!

        Well hello people. Whew. Havent written in quite a few days, but yes I am alive. Hurricane Charley was quite an expierence. Never again would I like to be in the middle of a Catagory 4 hurricane! Everyone here is okay, with only minimal damage to the house-nothin that cant be fixed. Three degress more on the map of the world, and we woulda been hit freakin hard. Punta Gorda was not very lucky, and I feel very bad for all those people :(. My Aunt, Uncle, and many cousins live in Arcadia. They no longer have a roof on their house because of this asshole hurricane. UGH! Sucky. Being without power for 16 hours was no bueno. But after we finally got power and saw the damage in other places, I stopped caring about no electricity because it could have been a lot worse than that. There are two more tropical storms that have formed, and one on the same path of Charley which seems to be heading for us. Freakin wonderful. We are never gonna graduate! We dont go back to school untill at least Thursday, if then. Ah! Never ever ever gonna graduate do do do do do...Oh well. Hope everyone else is well. God Speed.

        Well lets see. I arrived at Estero High School and went to class at approximately 7:10 this morning. At approximately 7:30 our new principal got on the intercom screaming (yes literally yelling) about dress code and blahblahblah and basically just presented himself as the new asshole principal. The I proceed to go to "community service" where I learn that I can no longer aide for a teacher because asshole (new principal) decided that aides could only aide for the office-so for 2 periods in a row every day I will aide for the office. End my life. Then the assistant principal sees my schedule and says why dont you have a traveling period for dual enrollment? I tell her because my lunch is 6th and I will leave after 5th to travel for dual enrollment. So she flips out saying that there is no way I am allowed to not have a lunch blah blah so she made me go see my councilor and get my schedule changed. It was a pain in the ass to change but we finally figured it out and here it is:     1st per-Chemistry Honors     2nd per-Community Service     3rd per-Community Service     4th per-Lunch     5th per-Student Council     6th per-Travel     7th per-Dual enrollment     8th per-Dual enrollment     So basically for the first semester of school all I have is Chem and then the second semester I will bust my ass doing chem, econ, and govn. I am beyond pissed. I also love how the new principal acts as though we are in boot camp. "We already put girls in IS for dress code, no stopping and talking in the halls, no cell phones on in school, no gum, you need your ID and Passport to freakin pee, no eating outside, blahblahblah!" I am so mad! Mr. Bode cooommmeee back! It was awful. I had been so excited for Senior year, and it already sucks because this jerk made a million changes for the worst! UGH! At least im in a good lunch, even though I still wish I didnt have one! BLAH! That is all. I am very pissed and am going to go take a nap before school. Goodbye now.

First, me and Guillermo (my partner in crime) played Josh and Jess in caps and lost horribly! So after that I decided I was done...unitll I met the most GORGEOUS guy I have ever seen Omed. Wow. We danced for a while and then challenged Jess and Josh (who were still undefeated) to a game of caps. And we lost once again horribly. Oh well. He was  gorgeous  so it didnt matter. Then we danced a little more and it was time for Guillermo to drive us home. It was all fun times and a great way to end the summer vacation. School in 1 day if anyones interested! Alright time to sleep cuz I cant even comprehend what Im typin! Goodnight!

        Hello everyone! It is early in the morn' and I'm about to leave for work, but figured I'd update the blog a bit. Yesterday (Friday) was a pretty well-rounded day! Got up, chilled around the house for a while and then met Tony at McDonalds! I got a happy meal and it was superb and made me happy (and I was so nice and gave Tony my cookies!) Then I headed over to Miromar, met Nick and we frolicked inside to get out paychecks (with my freakin 15 cents raise-I wanted to tell them to stick their whole 15 cents where the sun dont shine) and our bonus checks (that the government feels they needs to take 35 percent out of for friggin taxes!!) That was swell times! Then I headed over to Tonys and we watched the MTV Reality show awards! lol! Then it was time for him to go to work at the good ol Outback so I went to mi casa, and hung out with the mom for a few. Then to my daddys! Now I am home! But I must go to work now-goodbye kiddies!          P.S.-I feel FREEEEEEEEEEE!! No more drama, no more bullshit! Woooo!!!

        Hello People! The day was decent I must admit. I awoke to find myself to 4 hours before work time. Hung around the house for a while and then Tony came over and we watched Newlyweds and had a swell time. Then it was off to work I went. I work 3-10 but it was fun because Jenn was the closing manager and we can basically do whatever we feel like with her. So Guillermo and I played around all night and had a grand ol time. Then Guillermo, Johnny, Nikki, and I were supposed to head over to Josh and Audras with everyone else from the Nike gang, but my poor dear Audra had an allergic reaction to something and was not feeling her greatest. So then, very depressed, I changed back into my pajamas-very sad-for I had nothing to do for the rest of the evening. But wait? What is this I see? A message from Tony telling me to come to his casa! Fast forward to after going to his house: I just returned to mi casa from a splendid night at Tonybabonys! We spent our evening watching Roadtrip (another silly movie that I had not yet been exposed to). Glenn you should be proud of me for expanding my horizons and watching new things! lol. It was another movie that also made me giggle. We watched it with his Uncle Jim who told funny stories from time to time. It was a good expiernce. For the first time in forever Tony and I were actually able to spend an evening without any interuptions from one of the 3 crazies. That was swell! (and greatly appreciated!) And then it was time to come home. So I did. And here I am. Nothing much else to say right now except that I dont have to work tomorrow which is exciting. Also-only 4 days till school! Wooo! Goodnight world!

        Tonight was lovely. Tony and I went and had a splendid dinner at Beefs, which I payed for because I owed him dinner just like he owes me Ice Cream. We then came to mi casa and watched Starsky and Hutch and I giggled quite a bit. We then decided that since Tony is tall and blonde he is Hutch and since I am short and brunette, I am Starsky. After we finished the movie we were bored so we layed around and told silly stories and said Starsky is bored. So is Hutch. Play Hutch play, play now, play now. It was good fun. To bad crazy g, and crazy s had to ruin some of the fun. We also told stories about crazy c which was silly. Tony is a fun boy and I call him Tonybabony. Then it was time for Tony to leave, so he took out his movie, packed up his survival bag and headed for the door. I sighed because I knew that I would then be bored without him. And I am. The End.

        FORGET BEER, PASS THE LIQUOR: Oh, beer's fine, but if someone else is buying, you want the expensive stuff.

       Hello kids! Well today was very rainy and gross. I would appreciate it if the rain would stop right now. I had to wake up at 6 to go into work at 7. Do you know how insane that is?! I havent got up that early in forever! But I got to get McDonalds breakfast! Wooo! Havent had that in forever. Got off at 1 which was swell! After work I went shopping with Bub and tried to show him my ways of shopping but he wasnt having it. I was bad and bought a shirt, which I wasnt supposed to do because I have to many. Shame on me. After that I brought pictures from my birthday to Justins and we laughed about how bad we both looked. lol. He got a job! I am so excited! I Have been waiting for this day since October! I will go harrass him lol. But anyways-heres some things going on in my life:      1. Cam and I decided that I have narcalepsy. We came to this conclusion because when he was here I feel asleep in the movies, and at my house. "You'll have that." We werent sure if that was the name of the desiease we think I have but Cam summed it up with "That word looks cool enough to do the job."      2. The letter I got from Edison was a fake. I called and the lady said "Oh we send those to everyone, you fully registered though." But why would you send it to me if im fully registered? I ask. "Because we send them to everyone." Oh okay! So glad I will be getting an education at your college! Geesh!      3. Tony owes me a car wash and an Ice Cream.      4. I have the worst cramps of my life. Justin says I either have golbladder problems, kidney stones, or just gas. Lol. I like to believe its one of the first two.      5. I decided not to go to my interview at Hollister. Brian asked me if I ever took my   dream   job there:      Brian: "So Nicole, did you ever get your dream job at Hollister?"   Nicole: "No, I decided for 5.50 an hour they can kiss my ass!"   Brian: "Yea, dreams suck!"      6. I went to a Student Council Convention in March and ordered a DVD that I am just now receiving today. Only 5 months late! Glad their on the ball!      7. School starts in 6 days. Im soooo excited!      Alright my lovlies! That is all for tonight! Goodbye!!

        This weekend was alright I suppose. Very lazy. Saturday consisted of shopping and work. I was bad and bought more clothes, but they were extrememly cute. Work was absolutely horrid. Gavin and I got into a screaming fight in front of everyone we work with, and my manager Kristy begged me to just go out with him so she didnt have to listen to him cry about it anymore. UGH! Work  SUCKS!  Work also sucked because Guillermo and Keithery beat me up!! I have bruises all over me, but I got them back by biting and pulling their leg hairs. Muwhahahah! Today consisted of Torrential Downpours (as Glenny-poo would call them.) So it was a lay around and do nothing day. I caught up on my sleep which made me happy. On a stranger note, I sent in my application to Florida State University on Friday. How freakin crazy is that?! My COLLEGE application. Woo. If I dont get in there I seriously dont know what I will do. I do not want to go anywhere else. Blah. On an even stranger note, school starts in 8 days. Eight freakin days and I will be a Senior. I am sooo excited. I want this year to start so bad. (How brainwashed am I that I am excited to go back to school?! lol) But seriously I cant wait-this year is gonna rock! Alright well I am gonna go now. The love of my life-Tonybabony-may be stopping by shortly! Wooo! Havent seen him in a while! Peace out!
