      i had cramps so bad yesterday that i left work after only one hour.  i cried the whole way home (or the whole way to robert's home).  Took two hydrocodones and completely passed out for like 3 hours.  i then proceeded to watch 4 or 5 movies and ordered pizza.  i took a bubble bath and relished the fact that i got to take a day off.  i've been going non-stop for awhile and maybe this was my body's way of saying, time out.  When i was in London Jenny Bonny was my bunk mate.  She was the first person i knew to be openly on antidepressants (this was 1999)  Sometimes I'd wake up with little white and green pills all over my bed that she had absentmindely let drop through the cracks.  Once, while i lay in fetal position with mascara smeared all over my face from suffering, she admitted to me that she liked to have cramps because it was an excuse for her to lay in bed all day and be lazy.  At the time i was horrified and felt she obviously had no idea what it was like to be in real pain.  hmm.... i think i may have been a little premature in my judgement.  Now -post prozac- i understand perfectly.  Yesterday was exactly what i needed.

      So I'm still living out of my car.  I'm hopping from couch to couch.  My car smells like dirty laundry.  I have looked at so many scarey places that i just want to give up and take the first decent place i find.  All of that withstanding I'm happy to be here.  You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you're totally freaked out thinking, "Where the hell am I?"  Well I don't have that feeling.  Even though i don't have a home, I feel at home.  I'm trying to break bad habits-fast food, soda, no exercising and more  personal things on a religious level that I have felt I let slide.  I'm trying to improve myself by reading more and even listening to the news.  I have high hopes, but as some of my friends know I'm a little weak.  I need to surround myself with supportive people.  This workplace is providing that (Aside from the lesbian that apparantly has a death wish for me) and most people here are very encouraging and i feel like they would like to see me succeed.  So for today I'm good, just takin' it one day at time-

      So this cold has not gone away yet and it comes in stages. Right now I am in the stage where both my ears are clogged and I can't hear ANYTHING! Everybody today was asking me to talk louder or talk quieter, and after awhile(like five minutes of that) I was like "FUCK everyone I can't mutha fuckin hear today OK, GOSH, IDIOTS! "  I just came back from the O Team game. They didn't win but I have to say that they are getting better, big props to the team members who read this. You may be losers but dammit you guys try your hardest:)  I am excited to go out to a club Friday night. I love to dance, whether I am good at it or not. You put on a song with a good beat and I'll dance my ass off. Even if I am sitting in my chair at work and Sara puts on some classic hit like Everybody dance now, by C & C, I will just stop what I am doin and dance down the hallway. Nicki in the Middle the middle the middle(That ones for you Nick Nak)  Just like Mike, I would also like to give a shout out to everyone who reads my blog. You guys are awesome and I am glad that I know such funny people that are a blast to hang out with. I started a photosite that you guys should check out. Here is the link:  urlLink http://rserver.photosite.com   Love Ya Guys

      Do you ever wonder what life would be like without drama? It would be boring as hell thats for sure but alot less stressfull!! It seems like you always try to get away from it, start fresh in a new place with new people thinking that, "This time I will not get involved in stupid drama.", but I'm sorry to say that there is no way around it. Every person, tall or short, nice or mean, fat or skinny, white or black, whoever... has some kind of drama that will effect someone else.  But as long as you keep in mind who is a true friend, who is real, who will be there for you when no one else gives a damn, who has your back through anything, and who truely loves you, then everything will be alright. This past year I have lost so many close friends and even my relationship with my father. And yet I have made new friends that I consider some of my best. Yet it does seem like when it rains it pours, you have to keep your head up shoulders back and eyes open, or else you will just go insane:)

      As I am writing this, I have 101 temperture, I can't breathe, my ears are clogged, I can't feel my toes, and my body feels like I fell off a cliff. That right there is proof that I had one hell of a weekend, it won't be a good vegas trip unless I was injured, sick, or had some crazy stories to tell, and I had all three! It was great hanging out with my new friends in the city of sin. I still can't believe that after 15+ drinks and gambling all weekend,I didn't get carded once, I knew that was gonna happen. I went to Studio 54 which was sooo much fun! I danced with some guy whom my roommate claims was cute, I can't remember cuz by that point everyone looked good:) I also did some things that I am not too proud of but it's all good, cuz it will stay in Vegas. Special thanks to Mike for teaching me blackjack and giving me my first $100 to gamble with  in the casinos, you're awesome! Thanks to Sara too for comin out with us Saturday night, hope your family is not stressin you too much.

      So for those of you that read my blog I am gonna let you in on a little secret. I am coming in late this Friday and blaming it on my kittens being sick , BUT REALLY Lauren and I are going shopping for clothes that we can't afford. I am really sick of work right now and honestly don't give a fuck today. If Michelle can be "stuck" in Houston and can have a "sick" kitten.  Unlike Mike who can leave and show up whenever he wants, I am a slave to production and they will get mad at me if I don't show up so if asked you know nothing of where I am Friday morning:)

      Today was a good day because I got a lot of stuff from various people. It started when I came to work and I had a bottle of Hpnotic on my desk and single dollars for the strip club from Margaret. Then Lance went out and bought me lunch pretending to be a PA and got me Sushi, ice cream and a diet coke. Then Matt gave me a neon green condom, which how many times a day do you get a condom from a gay guy, ya know. Then Joy made me a pasta dish that she brought in for me to have for dinner.  Put all those things together and you have a "hecka"(shout out to Sara) good night!!  So yesterday night, I decided to go buy my first "legal" bottle of wine. I go uo to the register and I am all ready to show my ID, and the bitch didn't card me. Ruined my whole experience! So that means that not only did she card me but apparently I look over 35 cuz they always card at the grocery store. Watch, I will not get carded the whole time I am in Vegas.

      So days like today are when I really hate my job. Sometimes I feel like I should stop finishing the projects that they give me and just fuck up stuff so they will not have me do it anymore, like the other PA's that I work with. Now that Ira is moving on to another dept, I am left with Dawn and Michelle and for those of you that know them , need I say more. I also have a supervisor that gets paid 3 times as much as me to tell me what to do all day and she just makes sure that I do it even though she is the one who should be doing these things. The other 2 people that are supposed to be doing the same jobs as me are either sleeping in the MOCAP room or following people around doing nothing. I am just a little irritated with being the only PA that people rely on the get shit done, ya know?  But I am going to Vegas this weekend and I am not going to think about work one bit and have the time of my life because what happens there stays there!!

      Today is my 21st birthday!!! Last night my new good friends Mike and Lance threw me a party at the Ponderosa. I have never had anyone throw me a party for my birthday and that meant so much to me that they did that.:) I stupidly didnt eat anything for dinner that night knowing that I was going to be drinking. I had a great time, I had a few lap dances from Greg, got some presents, and had alot of shots!!! I was fucked up by 10pm after having 6 shots of tequila, 3 shots of GoldSchalger, two rum and cokes, and five smirnoff ices(all this within a two hour period). The night after that point is a blur, I don't even know how I got home. I threw up all over Mike's room and couch and I feel real bad about that. I had no control of it, it just came pouring out my mouth. My Roommate Lauren was awesome and took care of me all night. At one point she went to the bathroom with me and pulled up my underwear for me cuz I couldnt do it, now that true friendship right there!! Then my family took me out to brunch today at this really nice restraunt on the harbor, which was good times. 21 is going to be a good year and I'm glad my new friends at work are alcoholics like me and will party it up with me. Vegas Baby!!

      So I am about to turn 21 years old and what am I doing with my life. I just moved to Orange County in late 2003 from LA. On my own for the first time ever. At first it was real scary but it is getting easier and I have come to realize that the real world sucks:) Not one...a single one.. of my friends from LA keep in touch with me anymore. These are people that I thought were my good friends and knew everything about me but obviously out of sight/out of mind. Even my best friend of 15 years...proved to me that our friendship was not worth saving and that she wasn't truely my friend. I was in a real bad way about a year ago... long story... but when I needed her more than ever, she decided that fucking her boyfriend(of whom was cheating on her with the mother of his child) was more important than being there to support and help her best friend. I also have a fucked up relationship with my father. I NEVER saw him when I was growing up and when my parents split when I was 8, he moved to Arizona and I saw him once a year. Now he is back and expects to be in my life. Fuck that...he needs to prove to me that he has changed. Growing up he lead me to believe that I was a bad person, that has made all the wrong choices and no matter what I did, it was never good enough. I never dressed the "right" way or had the "right" friends or did the "right" thing. Who is to say what is right and what is wrong, but for some reason...his opinion of me ran my life until now. Even still...I sometimes blame myself for my LA friends not keeping in touch and wonder if I was not good enough for them as well. I have made a lot of good friends out in Orange County and they have tried to make me feel better about myself but wonder if they will do what my LA friends have done and leave me....like my dad.
