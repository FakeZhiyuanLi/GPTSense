      Okay, this is getting a bit too much. Not music again? I never realised music played such a big role in my life. Sometimes I listen to music and if I don't, then I don't. That's all to it.  However, this seems to be a different case with this blog. All I ever seem to talk about is music, music and more music. I anticipate some protests about me continuously talking about music, so I'll promise to lay off it for a while, ok?  By the way, if anyone has anything to say to me but is too lazy tocomment or think it is not related to my topics, just put it on the tagboard. Thank you.

      The holidays have come!!! There are so many things to do it seems as if there is not enough time to do everything. I'm going to work for a week at a firm which my mum's ex-sudent is a partner of. I might get paid, hopefully, i'm not sure.  After that, the remaining week will be spent at college practicing the musical presentation for the upcoming A-Level graduation. We (the admin group) are facing some problems but that is only natural. I hope we can overcome the problems and make our presentation a success. After that, we might make a presentation at a hotel some time around July for an international conference. Finally, we will reach our main aim, the public musical presentation. I won't talk too much about it yet, just that it's all oldies. There is still much work to be done. We'll get it rolling hopefully after the graduation presentation.

      i seem to have acquired a taste for classical music. Actually, I acquired a taste for it quite a few years ago. I can attribute it to my dad's side, my mum says that she never really liked classical music. She complains that we(my two sisters and I) have all our dad's traits, but not hers. Of course we do have hers, but it is our dad's that show out the most strongly. I wonder why.  Maksim actually isn't too bad. His piano playing skills are quite extraordinary to me. Well, he's much better than me anyway. I only know how to play three Grade 3 songs which I memorised.  A short note to those reading this blog : I am attempting to perfect my English using this blog so if you do see any mistakes, be it in spelling or gramar, do not hesitate to comment and tell me about it. Thanks you very much.

      Haa... me, a phoenix.. most Asians view a phoenix as of the female sex but although i am a guy, i prefer the phoenix over the dragon. Why? This is becuse of the phoenix's tears heal, and also that they rise from the ashes. A fire burns brightly in my heart, sometimes it is extinguished, but then it springs up again, from the ashes. Do you savvy?

I am not sure.... knowing me, you'll be really unsure... because of my indecisive nature.. who knows, something good n interesting might happen to me afterwards, haha... crazy guy that I am, this just might happen...

      I've noticed that after some time, everyone seems to repeat themselves, especially an exciting or new experience. It's great if you are hearing it for the first time, but if you're follwing the person and he/she tells every other person the same thing. This is the reason I try not to repeat myself. There's a downside to it, though. I tend to run out of news very vquickly, and then I have to repeat the other things. Another slight problem is, I can't exactly remember what I told each person. I think I should just repeat everything that happens to me every time. It just makes life easier, don't you think?  Well, I'm learning to play the guitar, and my fingers hurt. I have had to press down like really hard on the strings because my fingers aren't strong enough yet. So, my fingertips are hurting. The only cords I have learnt are the Em and C cords. I'm not sure if I can remember all but I'll try. At least I can learn to play one musical instrument.

      One of my worst fears (other than my parents and ecxams) came back to haunt me last night. Loneliness... I am very much a people person and can't stand much loneliness - my biggest disadvantage. I can't focus well, I can't study well, heck, the only things I can do are listening to music or stone around while recovering. Luckily, the pool was there. The lights were still on, but never mind. I managed to recover quite a lot...  After that I went back to my unit. I did my maths homework in my housemate's room. He has a fantastic sound system which costed him around RM4000 because he modified it. I think it's  7.1 Creative product. So I managed to do my homework there awash in music. Then I went to another housemate's room and watched him play Caesar 3.  I seem to have lost my zest for studying(not really zest, but at least will), which is NOT good, considering the results of my last test weren't exactly encouraging. I have to buck up! I promised my mum 3As and I will have them!

      The haze has come, AGAIN. It seems to come every year now. Hang Indonesia for the open burning. Don't I have a right to breathe clean, fresh air in my own country? The pollution here is bad enough without the tronking(cool word i picked up from Kass) haze. It messes around with my eyes, which are the most sensitive part of me. It was already bad enough with the chemistry experiment with sodiun thiosulphate and the smell, now the haze decides to come along too! Those people who do open-space burning are VERY insensitive, methinks. Actually I wanted to go play tennis today, but thanks to the haze, I think I'll just stay indoors.  My parents are coming up this weekend to visit me(woohoo?). It's been some time since I've last seen them. My mum has chilled out and is not scolding me now, thank God. I don't know how much more of that I can take without really exploding... I've never really exploded at my parents before, it at all. I'm getting a chair from my house(the chair at the hostel is very uncomfortable and hurts my back) and some junk food. Hopefully they'll bring up a guitar too, so I get to learn to play at least one musical instrument properly, not like memorising songs as I did on the piano.  That's all I've got for now. I'll post if I have anything more to rant or rave about, or just for the fun of posting (is it really that fun?).

      Happy Father's Day to all the fathers in the world! Unfortunately, I thought it was ast Sunday(isn't it supposed to be the second Sunday of every June?) and SMSed m dad last Sunday. I did it again today too. He sounded pleased in his reply.  I read a Preteen comic strip today. It was very funny. The girls said that they thought it over that Father's Day was too commercialised so they decided to just give them respect according to one of the ten commandments. So one of them knocks a small gong, together they say "We honour you" and then back away. That was hilarious, especially when after they left the parents look at each other and say,"Man, our kids are cheap." Hoot!  Anyway, this is just to wish all fathers a Happy Father's Day. I know it is no easy job being a good father. To fathers who smoke, do quit smoking for the sake of your family. To those who feel that they aren't spending enough time with their family, chances are that ou aren't. It's just a choice and depends on your priority whether work is more important or time with your children. Just remember that your children won't always be there to play with you nor will theywait for you to grow up. They will be growing up constantly, as in the song "Sunrise, Sunset".

      As I've mentioned previously, I believe, there is a good and bad side to everything, which means practically everything is a two-edged sword. So are some bugs, maybe?  One of my pet hates are flies... just can't get enough of killing them. They are less of a problem here at the hostel as compared to my house. One of the problems I really face here are the ants. It seems as if they are everywhere... sigh....  One would think that there are no mosquitoes on the 8th floor. Unfortunately, one somehow managed to get into my housemates room. When I went there for a visit, I was stung by it... I get stung by mosquitoes whenever I go to the side of the pool too. I occasionally go there to chill out at night(sorry to all the couples dating there!).  That's all I have to crap about for now. I am waiting for Rajiv's blog about the taekwondo tournament he entered today. Maybe he can't post for sometime because he broke a hand or somehing like that (muahaha I'm evil). Just kidding. I hope he's fine.

      One of the things that annoy me is stupid chain e-mails. All of them are similar, if you don't forward it, your love life will fail, you will die horribly... all this is stupid! I am also slightly pissed off at the people who forward these to me too. They should have enough brains than to forward those to me.  This much I know is true, nothing bad has ever happened to me yet, not as those stated in the e-mails anyway. Well, if someone is going to get it, I might just as well get all of it and die from it anyway. I've already deleted so many of those. I'd rather just die than pass it on to the other 15 or 20 or even more people that is stated and let them suffer. If them, why not me?  I don't know how this topic came up, just popped up in my head suddenly...

      Well, this is courting trouble for myself but I have to say this : "Stop smoking!". Smokers do endlesss harm to everyone, not only themselves.  It hurts me to see people smoke, wasting their life and money, especially my friends(including my classmates). I was hoping for a class reunion with everyone present, not some gone due to lung cancer or other smoking-induced diseases. It's amazing how people manage to make money from causing other people pain and enjoy using it. Do they know how much pain my mother and her family went through when my maternal grandfather found out he had cancer? Although he had been smoking for decades, he stopped instantly. That was that, but in the end, he still lost the battle. I lost BOTH my grandfathers to smoking. I never even had the chance to meet them because both of them died before I was even born.  I hope that any of my friends who read this and are smokers do try to kick the habit. If you value your life and your friends, just quit it. You can't? I'll personally help you to! You will be helped by other non-smoking friends too, not just only me, trust me. All we want is for your own good. It's so sad to watch your friends smoking their lives away, and you can't do anything about it...  Toook this quiz, this is my result... quite true...     Griffin: Griffins are gorgeous creatures with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion.  You are smart and can think on your feet.  You also can be a bit of an airhead and may be called a ditz by others.  You are not stupid, but in fact, very intelligent.  You are also eager to help others and are usually docile and submissive. But if someone offends you you do bite back.    urlLink   What Mythological Creature Are You (Many Results and Beautiful Pics)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Most of my results from my semester exam came out yesterday. I got 55% for chemistry, 77% for physics and 72 or 73% for Maths... Well, as expected, got a blasting from my mum about the maths and chem marks. I didn't expect to get an A in physics either...  She threatened to take away all my activities. It's always like this, every time my grades go down(which is like, every other time), she always threatens to take away my activities, which she does. Guess what happened? I didn't even get to go out with friends. It's just study, watch tv, study.... great way to get good friends, eh? Now you know why I didn't have many good friends in secondary school(otherwise known as highschool).  There is no encouragement when I do bad, no "Just try harder and score better next time". All the encouraging words I ever get is, "Keep it up, we're happy with you", but when I get low marks, do I get any encouragement? No... Just scream and yell at me and take away my activities. That's ok, I'm just an emotionlesss robot anyway, aren't I? I don't have any emotions, and just exist in this world to get good grades and study, to hell with other activities. "I don't care how you do it, just get 3 A's at the end of this year", these were her exact words. Oh, so she wants me to study all day long and don't do other things? I can do that. See you in the nuthouse then. Or does she prefer me to cheat in the exam, get disqualified and thrown out?  I know this is for my good but this has gone too far. It's always like this. I know they'll have plenty other things to say, how they've encouraged me each time, whatever, that it didn't work and whatever....  They always have the last word -period.

      Somehow I am creating an impression on some people I meet that I am good, nice, excel in whatever I do... here I have to refer to the song by Simple Plan : Prefect. I'm sorry I can't be prefect.  Ever heard of the saying Jack of all trades, master of none? Know any? If you rea reading this now, chances are that you already know at least one, which is me. I am moderately good at studying, SUCK at sports(I have no stamina whatsoever, can only swim 1/3 of an Olympic-sized pool) and much to the disgrace of guys out there, am no good at computer games(well, at least I still beat my two elder sisters at them, haha, coz they don't play much, if at all...).  There is only one thing I can think of that is to my advantage : My promises and keeping them. Luckily I make promises and keep them, or die trying. That's like the only way to make me get off my butt and do something. If not I'll just sit there and rot or until my stomach growls or I need to go to the loo and so on and so on.... hahhaa.....  Well, I was feeling a bit stresed out last night, so I had to go down to the swimming pool at the hostel. I always go there when I am stressed out, it's quite cool there at night although there are some mosquitoes there. Since there were some couples sitting there already, I went to sit near the BBQ piut area, also near the pool. That didn't go really well, so I walked around the pool. My roommate and his gf were there. I saw them the instant I came down, but didn't want to disturb them, so I didn't call them. The gf saw me as I was walking around the pool and miss called me on my handphone. I waited till I got back then messaged her, telling her I already saw them. Sometime after that, my roommate came back and told me that they thought I looked as if I was going to jump into the pool! God forbid! Haha....  That's all for now. I'm sorry I haven't posted for so long. I think it will be quite some time before my next post because I have some catching up to do on my studies, just waiting for the bomb to explode when my parents find out about my results...

      I scored really low for my semester exam.. this sucks!!! I'm going to get hell from my parents. I could have done better, I think....  I changed my hairstyle again. Now it's getting straight down the middle thingy... before that it was left sweep to the right formal one, before that was spiky... When I first started to use gel to spike my hair, I got a new hairstyle every single time I used it, which was like a new hairstyle everyday. Cool eh? Now that I know how to use gel and style properly(thanks to a few tips from my good friend Rajiv, too bad he's gay, haha!), I can get quite nice results according to my taste(which doesn't really match a girl's way of thinking, me thinks). My mum always says i have horrible taste, especially when it comes to choosing clothes. Kind of gives me a goood reason to play golf, don't you agree? Haha...

      I have a graduation presentatoin tomorrow!!! Originally, I was mainly offstage, only going on to dance the cha cha during the musical interlude which is "tea for two" and "cherry pink". Then one of the male solists decided to stay offstage and i had to go onstage for nearly the whole preformance. Luckily the dances are not very complicated, if not I'd die standing because I'm a really wooden dancer and my memory sucks...  I'm not panicking yet, maybe tonight, hehe.... Wish me luck!

      There are so many different viewpoints of this world, some that we are aware of, some of which we are not. Regardless, these views continue to affect other people in their daily lives.  One interestnig viewpoint I got from my housemate(I stay at a hostel) is that in the end, humans are only God's slaves. Don't get all angry first, hear him out. When humans are born, they play for a few years, then study hard, work hard, earn money then die. So what's the actual point of living? Just to serve God??  My stand would be somewhat in between that. My aim in life is not only to score high, but also to help people. I view myyself as a sort of stepping stone for other people to become greater, hence the phoenix concept and sacrificial. If I think something is worthwhile, I will stop at no costs to complete it. If a promise comes out of my mouth, I will pull out all stops to fulfil it. yes, even stupid promises I made, which is partly why i am training to think before I speak. I made some pretty stupid promises but I'll still try to fulfil them. If anyone has any problems, I will always try to be there. Luckily no one seems to need me much, haha...

      I've always believed in the in & yang concept, partly because it sounds logical, and mimics Newton's Third Law, which is, "For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction". Heehee.  Today, I let my bad side get the upper side of me because I was very tired. Luckily, it didn't manage to show itself much, only towards the end of the evening. I'm better now, and the good side has regained control again, haha.... Anyway, i didn't really lash out at anyone because i felt that it would be unfair to the person if I just scolded him/her because I was in a bad mood. It managed to avoid me scolding and blasting a few people every now and then, luckily. Well well, what do you know, Vincent has a bad side too, you might think, but I'm only human. What you expect from me??? Of  course I have my ups and downs, and I think I am entitled to a black face now and then, but certainly not simply scolding other people.  I believe that each person has his/her abilities and disadvantages. I have my own EXTREMELY unique, or in other words, weird, way of dealing with stress. I will become very childish or just go crazy. It is so relieving to act childish coz when you are a child, you actually have less pressure on you(though I am not so sure about children nowadays...) so I feel the pressure lifted off me, haha.... You might want to try my way if you are willing to risk people labelling you as crazy or wacko. Frankly, I don't care much about certain comments people make, although i do care about some important ones. Well, it's my life anyway.

      I found a white hair!!! Actually, I found it quite a few weeks ago, on the 23rd of May, 2004. I was looking at a mirror when I saw it. I didn't really freak out. I just thought, hmm... a white hair, and continued with my things., haha.  Why I suddenly remembered it, I do not really know... it just popped up suddenly in my head(yeah, my head, get it? Haha.) I just love to play round with words occasionally.  Ok, that's all I've got to say for now. I'm sorry about this short post.

      I met my long-lost pen pal today!!! Yay!! Actually, she wasn't long lost, it's just that we've never met since the trip to China. She's grown quite a lot since then(4 years ago) and according to her, so have I. I couldn't recognise her, and vice versa. Luckily I recognised her mum. I had to travel quite a bit from Sunway to KLCC, but it was worth every single bit of the trouble, and even more. I had a headache the whole time I met her, but then I still felt quite happy. Some things about her haven't change, e.g. her voice, haha.... I keep in contact with her sometimes through the phone, so I hear her voice from time to time.  She's grown a lot, physically. Mentally, she still has some of her old ways of thinking, haha... luckily it is so, if not I would have been meeting a perfect sranger. We haven't been exchanging letters this year, but it'll start again this year, hopefully, after this meeting.

      For every meeting there will be a farewell - Quite a true statement, although there are some slight things about farewells I don't quite understand.  Why do farewells have to be sad? I feel sad every time I bid someone goodbye? Maybe it's because I love to be around people, so when people leave, I feel sad and alone. What do you think?  This is the last day of my attachment to Messrs BPN, a law firm at Damansara Heights, which is quite a good law firm in my opinion. All the people here treat me very nicely too.  They are not the only people who I am leaving today. I'll be saying goodbye to the two Singaporean girls I met a few days ago. They are 4 & 5 years old, but extremely smart and their command of English & knowledge is impressive. Amazing, the Singaporean education system, although expensive. Don't get started on the paedophile thing again!  So long, farewell, auf widerschein goodbye!

      Beware of paedophile (namely the author of this site)... haha.. one of my friends say. aiyoh, you are a paedophile lah, you even chat with and make friends with girls younger than you by about five/six years?  Well, what do I have to say about this? Sometimes I am just so bored I simply find people to chat with. Hey, it's a mere coincidence that some of them happen to be so much younger than me, ok? It's not like I purposely select younger girls, although I admit that I prefer to chat to girls. I don't have much to talk to guys(thinking of it, I don't have much to speak about to girls either).  So, read this and get involved with me at your own risk. You are warned... haha!

      5. I love to play practical jokes on people but I just can't bring myself to play jokes on people who I am interested in. So, that makes me kind of boring to them.  4. I seem to hav a problem chatting with people. I am always only asking the same questions e.g. how are you, how are your studies etc...  3. I can't afford to spend money and time talking and sending SMSes to my girlfriend.  2. I don't have money to splash/spend on my girlfriend.                             .                             .                             .                             .                             . Top reason why I can't and don't have a girlfriend : (drumroll)  My parents banned me from having one! (until I enter a unversity anyway)  Anyway, I think reasons number 2 & 3 are sufficient. It wouldn't be fair to my girlfriend. So from the things I have mentioned above, you can come to the conclusion that I am very much single, haha....

      Hey all, I'm working at BPN law firm at Damansara Heights, KL. This is actually my first time at a real job. Well, my mum wanted me to study law and I wanted to see what it was like, so I got attached to the firm for a week. I do't think I will get paid. Never mind, the experience is a kind of payment in itself.  I went conveyancing yesterday and today I went to court. I didn't get to see the judge though, because it was an in chamber case. Just my luck, haha. For the time being I am free. I just finished translating a legal document from Malay to English. I can't tell what the document is about though, because it is all confidential. My apologies.  Work here is quite interesting. I read one of the files yesterday, which is under litigation. Litigation is supposed to be one of the more interesting parts of practicing, as compared to conveyancing. I think we have a strong case and a high possibility to win that case.  I'll be leaving this firm end of this week, sort of unwillingly because the people here are nice and fun, partly because there is a German chick who will be attached here for two weeks at the end of this month. (Hey, give me a break, okay, I am a straight guy after all, unlike SOME people whom I know.- just kidding!)  I hope I get to learn lots at this firm. I might just come back here and work if and after I get my law degree. Wish me luck!

      I'm glad that at least certain people who read my blog don't find my comments on music boring. I listen to almost any kind of music, pop, rock, rap, oldies, instrumental, classical...  As for the kind of music instruments I play, sorry to disappoint you people but I only play three Grade 3 songs, which I memorised. I might learn how to play other iinstruments in the future though, when I start working and can afford to pay for my own music lessons.  What role am I playing in the musical presentation/ graduation presentation? I am currently doing some administrative work. Our guide/teacher says that I am good at harmonies(I never knew that!) but I can't really do those because we(my group) haven't found any suitable partners yet. So I'll just stick to singing in a group and dancing backstage. I'm not a main dancer because I'm too short, according to Sasha. What can I do about it, she picks all the tall girls on purpose.  That's all I've got for now. I'll post some more on music and my life in the next blog, this is getting too long.

      I wonder, how many people have wasted away their time thinking "If only... " Well, things are already over, so the best solution is to just get over it and move on with your life, methinks... If only this, if only that, all this wishful thinking... just wasting time. What say you? Although sometimes it desn't hurt to dream a little...

      I never knew I had feelings, not this sort anyway... The most I ever had was a short crush on girls, but then again, it only lasted a shortwhile... actually it's over between us already, without it even getting started... then along came a friend who pretended another gal like me and stirred up my emotions again... well, it was just an innocent joke, and he never really meant to hurt me, so I won't take any offence against him, although I honestly think jokes about emotions should be banned....

      I'm slightly repulsed at the conditions of the toilets I've entered recently. Why? Because the people who used it before me did not flush it after use. Come on, you have enough brains to go to&nbsp;a toilet but not enough brains to flush? Then you may as well just go and answer the call of nature when it calls, regardless of where you are, who is with you etc. The next time you enter a dirty toilet, don't you dare complain because you did EXACTLY the same thing too... &nbsp; Phew.. been waiting to get that out for some time.... a silly rant but at least I got&nbsp;a say on that.... the toilets are bad enough dirty, but smoking in toilets? These people are inconsiderate. What about people who are non-smoking? What do we do about people who smoke in toilets? Go up to them to tell them politely not to smoke and risk getting our heads busted? If that happens, the person who got his/her head&nbsp;busted will probably get comments from people, e.g. Why did you go and mind other people's business? Don't you know how to keep your mouth shut? &nbsp; Hello, it's my life you are talking about here. If you want to smoke your life away, I couldn't care less, but please be a bit more considerate about other people. As they say, one man's meat is another man's poison. What's good for you may not necessarily be good for someone else. Think about it.

      To anyone who has been reading my blog(if there are any...) I'm very sorry that I have not posted anything recently. It's not that nothing is happening, it's an overflood of what has been happening. My nice secure world of bachelorism just came crashing down on Monday, or was it Tuesday night.... &nbsp; It's something that I feel is too personal to talk about here, although it is easier to tell strangers about things happening in my life because the implications that they have on my life is possibly &nbsp;very small... They are far, far away, most of them anyway.... &nbsp; I'll try to come up with some interesting thoughts soon, so keep on reading, ok? And continue clicking that refresh button ya!

      Do fun days always have to be exhausting? Well, yesterday was a bit tiring, and quite fun. What happened yesterday? Read on...  Yesterday, an Oxford-Cambridge event was held at Sunway College. I got to chaperone Mark disney, the editor of Education Quarterly. Cool! He's a really nice and fun guy, and his talks were really interesting. He talked about the art of writing, got some tips from his talk. i need help with my writing.  After that, I had a lousy lunch of nasi lemak, and then proceeded to the MPH(multi purpose hall) to set up the things. I was the DJ(kind of) for the day. The songs were actually preselected by a staff member, of course. I practiced with her before. There were a few glitches, ut luckily they were very small, nothing big. Not many people noticed them, methinks.  All in all, it was a pretty interesting day. One of my regrets was that I didn't get to mix around with the students. I'd love to get to know some students(wink,wink). The last time a similar event was held I was a student leaader and got to lead a school. this time around I was the "DJ", so I did not lead any schools around. Well, there are two sides to every coin.

      Ever gotten that gut feeling when people are choosing teams and you are afraid that no one is going to pick you for their team? I get it all the time, which is why I am so aggressive and fast when it comes to picking the teams.  Well, it happened to me again today. I actually chose a group already but a girl had her own group comprising of the same people I have chose. I was conveniently not in her list, not through any fault of hers, of course, because she did not call me to join the function this Saturday. It could have been considered a community project. Too bad that she already had ten people in her group then, all of whom she invited(I assume) to the function. I was at the meeting yesterday. She didn;t see me? Was she blind? (Sorry for blasting her, I think she is innocent.. :S )  Another team actually wanted me, but in the end they decided to pick their own classmates. This is understandable, and my friend (Kevin) need not have apologised so much too me. It kinds of make me feel ashamed, heehee.  In the end, I managed to get into the same group as my classsmates(woohoo?). Well, I wanted to work with soe new people, but I guess I am stuck with them,not that this is anything bad, i just wanted to work with some new people and know them better(besides being able to skip the project, since the function this Saturday is considerd a community project, but I'll still be there, I promised them). Let's just wait and see what community project my classmates select.

      Sometimes I feel that I am just too suspicious of people. I can be very observant and see someone from head to toe and make judgements in a flash, though I am trying to change that. I have been proven wrong too many times.  When someone does something nice for me, I am sometimes suspicious of what they might want from me. Some people appear to be very nice, then ask back for favurs, as if I am obliged by their earlier help/gifts to help them. Why is this so? Shouldn't this be sincere? I never expect anything else from other people when I help them....  That applies to most people I meet, the somebody something nice thing. Some of the people i have met have since then gained my trust. Why am i feeling like this? It is as if I'm so afraid of being hurt, yet, I can't remember being hurt in that way before, as in the opening up to people and getting hurt way...

      One piece of advice : Don't ever procrastinate... as all advice, it is easier said than done. Why is doing the right thing harder than doing the wrong thing, most of the time anyway...  My parents are coming up to visit me again tomorrow, and bringing up the back of the chair which my dad conveniently forgot to bring last week, haha.... My new roommate should be coming soon. I hope he doesn't smoke, not in the room anyway, or else I'll have a bone to pick with him... I dont care if he smokes himself all the way to hell(I care about some people who smoke, not all of them) but I'm not going to be dragged down witth breathing in second-hand smoke.  Well. the actual reason why I decided to post about procrastination is because I find it extremely damaging... It has managed to get me up to my neck in backlog, which I might most conveniently suffer amnesia and forget about, or they may mysteriously get sucked into outer space, haha.

      Guess what kinds of humans I hate the most? The special group callled hypocrites. Come on, if you are going to defile something and scold it and curse it and what not, you may as well just stay off that thing. Why do you, despite what you say, instead go and do the exact same thing? Unless you are prepared to take back what you said, which is what I do, if not, just stay away from me! Haha.. just kidding, don't stay away from me, just don't be so quick to condemn everything. I have taken back my words many times, although it is not such a pleasant feeling, but at least it's better to admit you are wrong.  I know that humans are not perfect, but please don't criticise others for something that you do yourself.

      We call ourselves humans, yet some of the things we do are inhumane, things which even beasts will not do. It just makes me sick when I read of these things in the newspaper.  What exactly are these things? Killing people for a few ringgit(Malaysian currency),  rape cases, animal torture cases... I went to the SPCA recently. What did I see there? Dogs and cats, either badly abused or abandoned. Some of them are recovering pretty well, others still have open wounds and stuff like that. Why did that happen? Because some "highly evolved" humans decided to keep a pet and then later changed their minds... highly evolved my foot!  One recent case about robbery was that a courting couple were killed, all for the sake of a few ringgit and a handphone. What is human life worth? Is it worth anything at all? Or are we just something that lives and breathes, and have nothing better to do? No other purpose?  I watched i,Robot yesterday with my eldest sister (yay!). It wasn't the most interesting show, but it did bring up some issues, as well as being quite funny in parts. One of the issues is, human beings and their existence. Vicki did make a lot of sense, human beings protectng themselves, no way! We are actually continually destroying ourselves. Just take a good look around you, and in the newspapers. Crime rates are getting higher, more and more diseases, wars on the brink of erupting...
