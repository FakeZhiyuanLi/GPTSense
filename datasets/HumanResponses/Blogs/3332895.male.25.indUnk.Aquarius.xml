      For about a week, I abandoned my regular  urlLink blog  to do a personal journal type of blog here. I found that the writing process here is much easier as there is no need to edit myself. My rants progress from general babble to long essays about nothing. I guess you could say that I had my first case of acute  urlLink blogorrhea .  Topics include boredom, death and the after-life, regrets, self-esteem, love and sex, pornography and my principles and philosophy in life or lack thereof. I was hoping that this would help enlighten me. Finding an outlet for whatever this is and at the same time, learn from this. After a week of writing, I became more confused than ever. Writing helps me solidify my thoughts and ideas into beliefs and principles. The more freely I wrote, the more I felt I had to edit. It felt as if I was writing this someone else. The fear of people judging the real me, I guess, is too overwhelming.  I wanted to keep the name of the blog, so I just deleted my posts. Thinking of what to do with this, I came up with the idea of a blog where I could place a list of my interests and hobbies. So another experiment ends and a new one begins...

      Lately, I've been singing this tune:  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho My sister and I laugh whenever we get to the Supergoddess part. The lyrics is for the song "Extraordinary" by  urlLink Liz Phair . The video has been getting a lot of MTV airtime lately as it's included in Kate Hudson's new movie  urlLink Raising Helen .   I also like her song "Why Can't I":  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it So tell me Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you With songs like Extraordinary and Why Can't I included in her self-titled album, I think it's definetly worth downloading, I mean buying. =)

      The  urlLink Matrix  is such a great film.  Reloaded and Revolutions were good but, in my opinion, weren't on the same level as the first movie. The Matrix had a lot of original elements, like the kung-fu stunts, visual effects and their story. After watching the movie, I pondered on the questions raised by Morpheus in the film.  Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that your were so sure was real?  What if you were unable to wake up from that dream, Neo? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?   I wouldn't know how I would go about in answering that question.  Then, a friend introduced me to a book called  urlLink Sophie's World . He had read about it and  urlLink Philippine Daily Inquirer's  Editorial "Youngblood". The writer of the editorial graduated with a BS in Philosophy and was, I think, discussing the importance of Philosophy in our daily lives. Sophie's adventure starts when she suddenly receives questions in her mailbox:  Who are you? Where does the world come from? Her journey to answer those questions is what Sophie's World is all about. The book is a great read, part-story and part-textbook. And it's what got me interested in learning more about Philosophy.  As for the questions posed by Morpheus, I can try to answer that, but in another blog entry. =)

      It's almost the end of the month.  About time to do some maintenance work on the PC. My "To-Do" list consists of:  1. Check for updates/patches 2. Upgrading firmware/drivers 3. Scan for spyware/adware 4. Scan for viruses 5. Defrag and optimize PC  There's a nifty little free program that helps me deal with my last task.   urlLink TuneXP  is a tool to automate several tweaks that help your computer run faster. It also defrags and rearranges your boot files to decrease your boot time. It also includes an easy to read documentation so that newbies like me can understand what the  urlLink tweak  does. Just select the tweaks you want to apply then restart your computer.  I had some issues using the system file checker. It asked for the WinXP installation disk  to verify the system files. After rebooting, my display had been wrecked. The system file checker must have installed an old vga driver, seeing that my driver wasnt XP certified. I just installed the nvidia driver, problem solved.

      It's been a week since I started blogging.  And I've managed to put something up atleast everyday. Quite an accomplishment, since before I started this, I thought I had nothing to write about. It's been pretty tough to think of topics to share. But once I do have a topic, writing about it is easy.  To reward myself, I'll be taking a break today. =)  Actually, I just want to finish watching the movie HBO is showing tonight:  urlLink White Oleander   Update:  Alison Lohman's acting was great. A believable performace in portraying the 15 year old girl. I'm such a sucker for stories like  urlLink that .

      I've always wanted to get a broadband connection. Ever since  urlLink PLDT  started to offer their  urlLink broadband service , if my memory serves me right, in 2000. But the cost was too high. As a student, I could only reason out to my parents that having a broadband connection could help me research faster. With such a lame excuse, of course they didn't buy it. =P  Well, I now have a better excuse to offer. Although I don't need it anymore since I'm already  urlLink connected . But for those who aren't, let me share you this:  Cheap Long Distance Calls!*    urlLink VoIP  can now compete with the voice quality of local calls thanks to  urlLink Session Initiated Protocols  or commonly referred to as SIP.  One company that is cashing in on this emerging trend is  urlLink SIPphone . They are offering  urlLink devices  that are easy to set up and can connect to your regular phone. And they are the first ones to offer a services that can  urlLink call regular phones , albeit in only 10 countries.  Here's a  urlLink list  of software and hardware (phones) that are SIP compliant. I'm curently using the  urlLink BudgetTone-101 model . Having a  urlLink router  would be ideal, so that you can share your broadband between your PC and SIPphone.  *Note:  Although the call itself is free, the device, additional hardware (router) and the monthly bill of the broadband service costs money. Also, be sure that your ISP is offering atleast 64k of upload bandwidth. Anything less makes your voice "choppy" to the other party. I found out the hard way that  urlLink ZPDee  only offers 32k worth of upload.

      I'm an avid viewer of the Discovery Channel.  And one of my favorite stories was about beauty. It was hosted by John Cleese and Elizabeth Hurley. John was talking to Dr. Marquardt about his latest discovery. Previous analysis on what is beauty showed that there is such a thing as  urlLink the golden section .  Based on the Fibonacci series, the golden section is present in  urlLink Architecture  as well as  urlLink Nature .   urlLink Dr. Marquardt  developed the  urlLink golden facial mask  as a way of measuring beauty. His studies show that what we perceive as beauty conforms to his mask, meaning we unconciously recognize the golden section in our faces.  I envision this as a great school project. Build a booth. Take a picture. Apply the Mask. Great for fairs and school events. It's also a good excuse to take someone's picture. ^_^  Links:  urlLink The Human Face with John Cleese  - A summary of the episode I watched.   urlLink Dr. Marquardt's official site  - Read more about how he developed the mask.

      Quirky, Funny, Dark ,Deep.  Adjectives that I would use to describe one of my favorite movies:  urlLink American Beauty .  Those same words ring true about one of my favorite series:  urlLink Six Feet Under . No surprise there as the writer of the film and the creator of the series is by the same amazing person.  urlLink Mr. Alan Ball .  I'm a big fan of  urlLink Carrie and her gal pals , so I was sad to see them go. I thought that my tuesday nights would never be the same. Then I saw a part of the ad that would replace them. Six Feet Under. A show about death? Yipee... that sounds fun... =P. But when I saw that Alan Ball had a hand in it, I thought, Hey, Why not?  Okay, someone driving a hearse. Must be the main character. Bam! Gets hit by a bus. Dies. Guess he's not the main character. =P Kids taking drugs. Okay. Sex with a stranger. Interesting. Dealing with death. Touching. Quite a first episode. I got hooked early on.  Yesterday was a replay of the last 3 episodes of season two. Preparing us for the  urlLink 2-part episode premiere of season 3 . Season 2 ends as Nate, who has  urlLink AVM , undergoes cranial surgery to save his life.  This series definitely hit close to home. As our family experienced what the Fisher's experienced. February of this year, my mom had a  urlLink ruptured brain aneurysm  and had almost died. Thanks to the doctors and nurses of the  urlLink Makati Med , she's alive and almost (80%) back to normal. Currently undergoing rehab at  urlLink Asian Hospital .    "Every day above ground is a good one."   - Beautiful words to live by.

      Everybody knows  urlLink Ms. Norah Jones  has a great voice. I didn't realize how incredible it was till this morning.  I don't like waking up to rainy days. It's different now. I'm not saying the rain is different, or maybe it is due to increased pollution here in the city, but what I mean is that my thoughts about rain have changed.   As a student, I used to pray for rain.   The garbage that littered the streets would immediately block the drains and cause floods, which in turn, caused classes to be suspended.   The sound of the rain and the cool breeze would make it tough for anyone to wake up in the morning. I'd usually ask for another 10 mins of sleep time. And when you finally force yourself to get up, you'd realize that the rain means traffic and that extra 10 mins you asked is going to make you late. I'd rather not start my day with a sh!tload of stress.  So I try to relieve myself by listening to music. Selected the randomize sort in my playlist then began to dress myself up. Amazingly, it started with Norah Jones song Sunrise. Quite a coincidence eh? Norah playing in the background, the fresh feeling after just taking a bath, and the sound of the rain dying down. I'd place this as one of my best morning experiences.  After Norah was another woman with a soulful voice,  urlLink Ms. Vienna Teng  and her song  urlLink Soon Love Soon . I can only describe her as a mix of Tori Amos and Amy Lee of Evanescence. Give Ms. Teng's albums a try.

      I love food. As anyone who's seen me can immediately tell.   I enjoy eating. But I also enjoy cooking. I fancy myself as quite a cook. And whenever I find something I like, I try to recreate that in our house. Which ends up, more often than not, a complete disaster. It's easy to mess up if you don't have a good foundation, in this case, a recipe.   urlLink Top Secret Recipes  features recipes that are close to the original that they are trying to copy. My favorites are:  urlLink Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip Cookie ,  urlLink Kenny Roger's Roasters Corn Muffins , and  urlLink TGIFriday's Jack Daniel Glaze . Hmmm, I'm getting hungry again. Let's finish this up then...  The website also includes stories about  urlLink food urban legends  and a classic case of  urlLink social engineering .  Be sure to check their website weekly as they remove previous recipes and never post them again.  Links:  urlLink Social Engineering  - Definition

      I have several memories of my grade school life.  The speech clinic laboratory. The stories of ghosts that haunt  the different bathrooms. Lining up after lunch to get back inside  the grade school bldg. And the AVR.  The AVR (Audio-Visual Room) is where a class views educational films  and videos. It's quite small and if there were two classes viewing  the film, it was also a bit cramped. Having only an average sized TV, some of us had to sit up front on the floor so that we could see the  videos properly. And the one video that imprinted itself in my head was: The Lord of the Flies.  urlLink Movie | urlLink Novel .  I didnt understand it at the time. All I remembered about the film was kids killing other kids.  Enter Battle Royale.  Film Description: Battle Royale tells the story of a  dystopic future in which each year, a randomly-selected  9th grade class is kidnapped and sent to a deserted  island where they are equipped with weapons and are forced  to kill each other until one survivor is left. - taken from the website  urlLink battleroyalefilm   It's a really violent film. With a "Wham-Bam-ThankYou-Mam" kinda approach as opposed to  urlLink Kill Bill's  poetic approach.  Give the film a try, and see how you feel or react to the violent and gory parts of the movie. Remember that you can only take out of Battle Royale what you yourself bring into it. Watch with an open mind and hopefully you'll learn a bit more about yourself.

      I recently found this piece of software that made my life a little less complicated.   urlLink EvilLyrics  is a program that automatically searches for lyrics while your song is being played. It works with Winamp and is a joy to use as it frees me from having to manually search for the lyrics or browse through my saved files. It also saves the lyrics in your hd as a txt file so that you can read your lyrics offline.  Be sure to install the ELLO plugin. This nifty program organizes your saved lyrics using a "by artist" format. I think it's included in the EvilLyrics installer. Just mark the check box option to also install ELLO.

      Hmmm, it's been a while since my last post.  And it's not that I've run out of things to write, quite the contrary, I've several works lurking in my drafts section. It's just that I haven't finished or polished them and if I'm going to post them as they are now, you'd see just how messed up my thinking pattern is. =P  Now, the real reason for my lack of updates is... I've been dreaming.  Dreaming up two business ideas. I'm hoping that I can make them a reality within the year. Now,  would'nt my progress make this a more interesting blog?  No?   Guess not.

       urlLink     I got the "infinite mirror image" idea from  urlLink Eric Litvak's blog . If you look at my "mirror image", you would see that the image isn't perfect.

      I've just finished watching  urlLink The Sum of All Fears  featured in  urlLink HBO Asia's Summer Movie Marathon  and the one thing I've learned is that... I just love Tom Clancy movies.  Like one of my all time favorites, The Hunt for Red October, to Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger and Air Force One. Wait, the last one wasn't written by Tom Clancy, but it sure felt like one. That reminds me, Harrison Ford is set to make another  urlLink Indiana Jones  movie. Yippee!  The Sum of All Fears features a very pretty actresses,  urlLink Bridget Moynahan .  I first saw her in  urlLink Sex And The City  as the "bitch who stole Mr. Big's heart", Natasha. She was also in  urlLink Serendipity , where she also played opposite  urlLink John Cusack . I also noticed her in  urlLink Coyote Ugly  only after watching it again.  Another movie, which I would definitely like to see again, is  urlLink By Dawn's Early Light .  The story is very similar to The Sum Of All Fears, with terrorists starting a war by setting off a nuclear attack. In my opinion, this is a better movie, featuring a much better story, plot twists and a superb cast (Rebecca De Mornay, James Earl Jones and Martin Landau). If this movie plays again in HBO, be sure to watch it!

      I haven't let my  urlLink ZoneAlarm experience  get the better of me.  Two of my favorite apps just came out with their new versions yesterday. And I installed them without hesitation... well, maybe a little bit. =)   urlLink eMule Plus v1l   My favorite  urlLink p2p  client has just gotten better.  This is more responsive than its previous version. I guess that's because they have fixed some memory issues that caused the old one to become sluggish (after a few days of continuous running) and it doesn't crash anymore when you try to  urlLink preview  an video file while it's still downloading.   One of my original reasons for switching to this is that it blocks aggressive (aka leechers) p2p clients so that they  can't  download any files from me. I've always liked the idea of the edonkey network as it "forces" you to upload and share.    urlLink Firefox 0.9  Currently, my browser of choice.  It's has some nice improvements over  urlLink Mozilla 1.6 . For example, the download manager has a slick new interface and now you can actually pause and resume your downloads with it. Other small touches include the new way you bookmark a page and that you can see more of the webpage in the browser window.   Firefox now looks more like IE (preferences are now listed as options below the tools button). But this is much better than IE as as Firefox has it's own pop-up blocker and the uber feature: tabbed browsing.

      I just finished watching  urlLink Six Feet Under  and I felt inspired to write. =)  It's such a moving series that somehow makes you put your life in perspective. Just watching it makes me feel so cathartic. I guess that's one of the reasons why I like blogging. My way of venting out  stuff .  One of the actresses in the series is  urlLink Lili Taylor . She plays Nate Fisher's wife. While watching her, I'm reminded of two films where she played opposite  urlLink John Cusack .   urlLink Say Anything   Written by Cameron Crowe, the same guy who is responsible for these great movies:  Singles, Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire . It's also the first movie where I saw  urlLink Ione Skye . Another film she starred in:  urlLink The Rachel Papers , is quite memorable to me. ^_^    urlLink Hi-Fidelity .  I totally agree with Ian Creamers' review of the movie. The  urlLink soundtrack  of this movie is top rate. Especially the song played at the end of the movie. Stevie Wonder's I Believe. Having beautiful women, like Iben Hjejle, Lisa Bonnet and Catherine Zeta Jones cast in the film isn't so bad either. =P

      I'm not feeling patriotic right now. I'm guessing this is because there was no hoopla surrounding today. And that the weather is  making me feel a bit down.   urlLink NU107 's Independence Day Sessions started last night. I heard that Cynthia Alexander played in one of outdoor bars in Manila Bay. Imago, Sugarfree and Kitchie Nadal were at Gwailos Bar in Makati. I hope I got the spelling of the bar right. There's even a Gwailos hour every Friday (9-10pm) on NU107. Does their Gwailos mean the same thing? " urlLink Gwailos ".

      Disaster has struck my computer.  Well, maybe I'm overreacting here. And I have a tendancy to do that when it comes to my computer. Last Tuesday, I downloaded the new version of  urlLink ZoneAlarm . After installing it, I proceeded to setup my downloads for the night. Wednesday morning came and I checked on my downloads, only to find that my computer had froze up. Puzzled, I rebooted my system and did my battery of  urlLink diagnostics . Finding nothing wrong, I left our house thinking that it was just a glitch. I was wrong.  Once I got back, I started up my computer. Seems fine. Surfed. Mozilla seemed a bit sluggish. Got me worried. Checked my email. After 2 minutes of downloading from my pop3 server, my internet connection froze. Strange, as my dsl router indication light showed I was still connected. Reboot. Checked my email. Froze again. Reboot. Ran another program. Froze yet again. Ok. So now I'm thinking that ZoneAlarm is the problem. Disabled ZoneAlarm. Enabled Windows' Internet Connection Firewall. Better than nothing. My fears were confirmed when I read the reviews from  urlLink Download.com  and  urlLink FileForum .  After uninstalling it, I found out that I had deleted my previous version of ZoneAlarm. Good thing that Norton Systemworks has Unerase Wizard. Things are a still a bit buggy after installing the old ZoneAlarm as it has problems remembering the security settings of some programs, eventhough I add it manually. Weird.  Friday Evening,  Paranoia  has set in.   I'm noticing other programs run differently now. WinRAR and Windows Explorer seem a bit sluggish. I'm thinking of reformatting. But that takes a lot of time as I'm quite picky about my settings so I have to write down or save the ones I currently use. And the troublesome patches and fixes for Windows XP that I have to download. Since it's a reformat, I'd have to move my files to another hd or partition and move them back again once I'm finished. That's definitely a lot of work. And I'm definitely not in the mood to handle that right now. I know I should delay reformatting till a serious problem occurs but my obsessive compulsive side sometimes gets the better of me. Good thing my laziness balances my " urlLink Mr. Monk " personality.

      I'm a hopeless romantic.  I got a nice warm feeling after watching  urlLink Sleepless in Seattle , that was shown tonight in Star Movies. I nice movie, appropriate for this kind of rainy weather. I like what the movie says. Especially about the part when Tom Hanks describes the first time he met his wife.  "It was like... Magic."   I'm a big fan of Meg Ryan. Here's a list of my favorite movies starring her:   urlLink Innerspace   urlLink French Kiss   urlLink Addicted to Love   urlLink City of Angels   urlLink You've Got Mail  Her latest film,  urlLink In The Cut , got some mixed reviews. She seems tired of acting in those romantic comedy type movies. I'll watch it, if only to see her naked. The same reason I watched Halle Berry in Monsters Ball. =P  And to other news... the NBA Finals, and LA lost to Detroit. Damn.  Anyway, it reminded me of one of my favorite anime's,  urlLink Slam Dunk! . Shown on GMA, the series ended just before they went to the national tournament. For those wondering what happened to Shohoku, read the  urlLink manga . At least, Shohoku's battle with Sannoh is more exciting than the 1st game of the 2004 NBA Finals.  Haruko-chan!!!

      I am the perfect exemplification of the  mañana habit .  I was supposed to post something late friday but instead, I watched tv and fell asleep. I had the whole of saturday to create a post but kept thinking that I could do it at a later time. Then sunday came, woke up, I was welcomed by a cold rainy morning so I decided to sleep a bit more after breakfast. No wonder I'm so fat. =P Now I'm scrambling to post this. I'm known to my friends as the " Last-Minute-Boy ". Maybe that should be changed to the " Last-Minute-King "!  Friday night was amazing. My friend invited me to watch  urlLink Cynthia Alexander  perform at the  urlLink Alabang Town Center : Corte de las Palmas, for the Acoustic Nights 2 concert series. I was pleasantly suprised to see my former schoolmates there. Migs and Mark's company,  urlLink Knockout Productions , was hired to cover the event.  Only Cynthia, Malou and their Indian(?) percussionist were there to perform. Sancho, the  other guitarist was MIA. It was my third time to watch her. Her live perfomances are absolutely amazing. Her sound setup was, as always, perfect. It was as if you were listening to a cd. It's a definite feast for the eyes to watch her play. With all the nuances in her performance, there's always something new to watch. Another band played during the intermission. 6 Fret, if I remember correctly. They were quite good too.  You can watch Cynthia Alexander every Saturday at  urlLink Conspiracy Bar . Where she's a part owner owner, I think. =)  Links:  urlLink Cynthia Alexander  - Official Website (?)  urlLink NA Records  - Her record label

      I received an interesting email last week.  urlLink Read it here   Taken from the book entitled  urlLink Atlas Shrugged  by  urlLink Ayn Rand , the excerpt disputes people's opinions that money is the root of all evil. No surprise there as Objectivism, Ayn Rand's Philosophy, also states that the concept of  Capitalism  is the only  moral social system . Although my  urlLink friend  suggested that I read  The Fountainhead  and  Atlas Shrugged , I'm more inclined to read  urlLink Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand  and these books  urlLink [1] , urlLink [2]  that refute it.  It's great to have friends that I can discuss philosophy with. As we did last week at  urlLink Gerry's Grill  in Malate during a friends' birthday party. And after butting our heads, we went to Indo Street at  urlLink Roxas Boulevard  to cool down and sober up.  Remember kids, Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk. =P  Links:  urlLink Objectivism  - Philosophy of Ayn Rand

      I've been doing a bit of self-reflection for the past week on my other  urlLink blog . But I'm done with that now, so lets get back to updating this blog. =)  If you want to know more about yourself, try answering a few  urlLink Tickle Tests .  Formerly Emode, Tickle has a lot of tests to help you reveal your subconscious mind, your IQ and your personality. Signing up is required but free. Be sure to try the inkblot test!  I still remember the DOS program I used in high school, Dr. Shrink. You rate a virtue, emotion or characteristic between 1-5, with 1 not likely and 5 very often. For example: Patience - 1 2 3 4 5 There was also another program called Dr. Shrink that allowed you to "talk", you typed in your response, to the doctor and he will give you a diagnosis. I remember it being included in a test about language recognition programs. If the testers couldn't differentiate the computer program response from a real person's response, then the program would be considered successful.

      It's been over a month since my last post. Rather than explain why, lets just say that I was "busy". Except for the new Blogger interface,  things haven't changed much. Or is it "much changed". I wonder when was this implemented. Anyway...  Guess the Blogging bug got me again. Which happens when I can't sleep or after watching Six Feet Under. The reason for this "blah" of a post goes to the latter.   Several things caught my attention during the 2-hour season 3 finale. Like how Nate used sex to fill a void, just like Brenda did. Here's one reason I find the show "frustrating". The sex scene with Nate got me aroused, but right after that, they showed the scene of David "getting it on" with another guy. I find it funny that I can be easily "turned on or off". Pathetic, eh?  Moving on to deeper issues, like how Claire decided to get the abortion. I haven't made up my mind yet regarding that issue, but could you blame Claire for deciding to go through with it? The scary thing was how the women were being processed, like going through a factory production line. That episode can be described in one word: COLD.  Good thing that this was a two hour thing, or I'd sleep depressed.  The next episode can also be descibed in one word: HOPE. Hope for David and Keith's relationship. Hope and closure for Claire. I can't remember if her ex O.D. or something. I found that scene comforting with Claire talking to her father, her ex, Lisa and her aborted baby. Would it be nice to see and interact with your departed love ones like that and not like that fucking scary movie the "Sixth Sense". I found Rico's infidelity and the new hubby to be an interesting development in the story. Can't wait for the 4th season to start.  Guess I'll have to force myself to watch the final season of Sex and the City for the mean time.
