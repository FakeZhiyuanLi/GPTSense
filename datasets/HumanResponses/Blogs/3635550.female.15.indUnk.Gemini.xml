        I just got home from the party at punky's house with all the french exchange students. SOOOO FUN!!! um, can i just say that i love guys?? like, i really truely do. Like, i really think that chels and i should follow through with our plan to go to Bellermaine. hahahahhaa. i especially like hot french boys and hot band guys. yay! hahah, it was so fun even though i got pushed into the pool and two of the guys were like, determined to drown me and punky. hahahaha. it was hot though. it made me realize that i've totally forgotten how to speak french in the past 2 months though. like, its pathetic. when the hot metro guy who doesnt speak like, any english asked me to speak in french i was like, "umm......." yeah, it was bad. Its a good thing I'm repeating some stuff in French class next year. Je veux parler bien le francais!!

        its been a long day, hahah. my neighboor came by at 7:20 this morning to pick up my dog so my dog and her dog could play, but since i was home along the night before, the alarm was on because my dad hadnt left for work early in the morning and turned it off. so, at 7:20 in the morning the burgular alarm goes off and i hafta wake up and turn it off. and, since i was home alone the night before, i went to bed at about 5:30 am, so you can imagine how unhappy i was to wake up 2 hours later.  
  
 I went to see West Side Story at PYT, which was really good. The thing about that show and "Romeo and Juliette" is just like, how the hell can you meet someone and know that you are in love with them like, 5 minutes later? And then, when the guy you met the day before, who you are now randomly in love with and planning to marry that night, kills your relative who you are very close with, how can you just be like, "oh, its ok, i love you so much that i can forgive you even though i just met you YESTERDAY and i've known my brother/cousin my whole life." Like, thats just weird. but i love both of those shows anyway.  
  
 After the show i played tennis with sam, which was hillarious. it is sooooooooo hard to serve when someone is trying to distract you by playing air guitar with his racquet and like, humping the air. oh, and there were all these mexicans who were there watching us the whole time. it was kinda creepy. Anyways, i feel like crap right now, so I'm gonna go take a shower and listen to love line. YAY! I had to stop playing because i felt like shit and then i came home and i passed out. It was weird, ive only passed out once before. anyways, i miss all of you who are still away for the summer, and y'all better come home....SOON. xoxoxoxx

        Trying to plan out what i'm going to do at Lawrenceville in the next 3 years is giving me such a bad headache. i really wanna take a term abroad in france, which i would probably do in the first trimester of junior year b/c thats the only time that really makes sense to go, but then all my scheduling is fucked up. and the fact that we take classes in a different order at castilleja than at lawrenceville makes everythign harder too. ughhhhh. also, i got this whole packet of stuff from the school including the handbook and some of the rules are really annoying. i mean, they make sense, but they are annoying, lol. like the co-ed visitation rules.

            the weirdest thing happened yesterday. i was in the car with my mom in east palo alto and we were stopped at a stop sign and i saw Nate!!!! i mean, i havent seen or talked to him in like, 9 months or something and then i randomly saw him. and yes, i am positive it was him. he was wearing the same weird hat he wore to the dances, lol. hahah, i have a good memory for random little details. its weird, i can't even remember what day of the week it is but i can remember little things from when i was like, 3.     I'm just about to leave for ericas wedding. i would just like to say that i really suck at packing light. i will be in LA for 5 days and i some how have ended up packing 5 skirts and pants, like, 8 or 9 shirts, and 4 pairs of shoes. plus my dress for the wedding. and 2 bathing suits. its crazy, i dont know how these things happen. hahah, and i tried to figure out if i could bring less but have somehow decided that i actaully do need everything i packed. we'll see.    when i was packing at 3 this morning, i started to think about cheating and like, what my opinions of it were. (random topic, i know) i know that most people are like, completely opposed to it and would never forgive someone for cheating on them but i dunno, i think that in some cases its not that bad. like, now and in college is the time when we are supposed to have fun and be crazy and make mistakes. and like, people get drunk or caught up in the moment or just dont think clearly. im not saying that people should just like, go out and cheat on their bfs or gfs, but i think that like, "accidental cheating" is forgivable. i dont know if thats the best way to describe it, but what i mean is like, something that just happens. something that wasnt planned and just kind of happened in the moment. like, i think i would be really upset if someone was repeatedly cheating on me or something, but personally, i would rather be cheated on physically than emotionally. like, if i really liked a guy that i was going out with, i would rather have him makeout with some other girl at a party than have him never do anything but be like, in love with some other girl. you know? i dunno, maybe thats just me. but yes, that was my random thought of the day. im not saying that i would cheat myself, though. just&nbsp;b/c i cant really imagine that i would.     anyways, i know this has all been incredibly random but no one reads this anyways so its fine, hahaha. and now i hafta go get ready to go to the wedding!! hahah, i still have no where to sleep tomorrow night. i guess ill just hafta sleep on the beach. i was supposed to stay with haley but now she has to fly home right after the wedding b/c she has rehearsal for "The Little Princess'" on sunday morning that she cant miss b/c shes a lead. sucks for me, doesnt it?

      I decided to get a blog cuz i figured it would be a good way to keep you guys posted about my life next year, but im sooooo bored and everyone is away for the summer so i thought i might as well start now. i just got home from "anchorman" which i thought was reallllllly funny, even though i know some people dont like it. hahah, i was like, dying of laughter though. will ferrel is sooo funny. and i havent seen Christina Appelgate in anything since "the sweetest thing", which you all should see, btw. (But please dont tell ur parents that i reccomended it and then watch it with them like cristina did!!hahah) Then earlier today i went to a rehearsal for singing at Erica Wyman's wedding next weekend. Im sooo excited for the wedding, especially since my family isnt going, lol. Oh, and i get to stay with Erica the night before her wedding b/c like, the bride isnt supposed to stay with her fiance the night before, so that'll be fun. After that i went to the Los Altos art and wine festival and i ran into like, so many people i knew there, so that was fun. so while all my friends are on the east coast or in china or costa rica or england or france, im just hanging out here in palo alto, which is so exciting, of course, lol. i miss you guys!! OH, BY THE WAY, happy birthday sam!! anyways, im gonna go look at chelseas pics from camp, so ill post more about my tres exciting summer later.

       hahah, Nick and I were like, the people you never wanna get stuck on a train with today. it was soooo funny. we were listening to all this music b/c we both listen to the most random stuff and we were like, dancing around in our seats and probably being incredibly loud and annoying. but it was so fun, hahah. we made up a dance for "its raining men" and made rachel and beth guess what song it was for. like, it was seriously the most fun train ride of my life and i was cracking up for sooo long. It totally made my day, haha.

       k, its like, 3:30 in the morning and i have nothing better to do then tell you about ACT. its this program im doing up in SF for 5 hrs a day and its like, mainly singing and then some acting and dancing stuff too. its been pretty fun but totally exhausting. i hafta wake up at like, 8 30 b/c i hafta leave at about 9 45 to get the train and then we get there at like, 11 and then we take a bus to where the theater is and get some lunch, and class is 12-5, and then i get home at about 6 45. the people in the class are really cool though.  
  
 theres this one girl jessica who could totally be a Guess model. shes 5'10" (but she usually wears heels) and really skinny and standing next to her is like the only time ive wanted to be taller. haha, i feel so short and dumpy and fat next to her. quite depressing. then theres this guy elliot who went to tennis camp with my and punky, so its like, so weird that hes in this class too. he was like, really weird at camp but hes like, so hillarious. i cant quite decide if we are laughing WITH him or AT him, but its funny anyways. then theres this hillarious guy doug who totally reminds me of this guy i was in love with in like, 5th grade or something. Then there are 2 girls, Beth and Rachel, and this guy Nick who is like, the coolest and funniest person ever, who take the train with me. they come from san jose so i feel like, so sorry for them because they have an extra 20 mins or so on the train. k, wow, this is a really boring entry. oh yeah, one more person. theres a girl who is friends with 2 girls punky and i were friends with at tennis camp and shes really cool too. her dad like, owns a movie theater where they hold alot of screenings and festivals so shes met a bunch of movie stars which is kinda cool. haha, u can tell its 3 30 in the morning when im writing something this boring and its taking me like, 5 mins to write a coherent sentence.  
  
 k yeah, i think i should try to go to sleep b/c i hafta wake up soon. fun times. btw, i have some new pictures up on my snapfish site.

      Beth (this girl from ACT) was telling me on the train ride home about some guy she knows who's name is Harrison Balls. as in, Harry Balls. what kind of parents would like, inflict such emotional trauma on their children? another example: there was a guy at my elementary school named Frances Benederette the Third.  and i TOTALLY dont get the crazyass guys named richard who go by dick. like, ummm, whats wrong with rich? like, dick? that doesnt even SOUND like richard. and like, come on, theres no girls name that has the nickname "pussy." so why would you WANT to call yourself dick? weird. and parents really need to like, be more careful when they pick their kids names. Gwenyth Paltrow's baby's name is Apple. that kid is gonna be one FUCKED up child. anyone named apple is gonna have a hard time in life.

       It still hasn't fucking hit me. Less than a month to go and it still hasnt hit me. I know exactly what'll happen. I'll finally realize it when I'm boarding the airplane. Or maybe I wont even realize it until I land. I might not even realize it until something goes wrong at school and i need one of my friends from home and I realize that they arent there to help me.

       do any of you find it weird that Paris Hilton's sister is named Nikky, her best friend is named Nicole, and her ex bf is named Nick? seems a little odd to me. shes modeling for Guess now. shes really way too blonde to be as tan as she is.
