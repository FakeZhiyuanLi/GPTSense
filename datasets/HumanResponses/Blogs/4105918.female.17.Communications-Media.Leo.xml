      Ok, so I was out visiting a friend in Shelter Island and we were sitting having some wine when we began to talk. We came up with a brilliant idea which I am extremely excited about now. We decided that we were, at some point this year, going to sail to Cuba. My friend has already tried to do this but thanks to the ill-equipped  captain and the boat that was frequently falling apart they did not make it. But this time WE WILL! Awesome! I can't wait. Then some other time we are planning to go to Africa and during February and March I am going to shoot a documentary in Mexico but I need to find a crew. I guess this year will be some what exciting! I Love you! -Tokyo

        Dear God! I fucking love you gill gill! You have engendered me with ME! You are me! I am not myself without you. I cant be. Without you i am nothing. Without you i am an empty body, i am a void waiting to be filled. Your like a sweet drug, filling my veins with beatitude and effervescent eternal laughter and joy. Gill gill never leave me. You are my life. Someday we will live together on L squat and be forever in a state of immutable bliss. Everything you touch, gill gill, is cool. You are beautiful and you are better then anyone has ever even strived to be and donâ€™t let anyone let you think otherwise. -Tokyo     p.s. I love you.

        Hey every body! welcome to the Everything Is Food blog. First i will start by giving you a short introduction. Everything Is Food is almost the best band in the world. Well. . . i guess thats all i can say. . . My name is Tokyo and i play the geeeetar and my bro, Bake Sale, he sings. We reside out in the Hampty Hamps and spend most of our time fantasizing but apart from that we also are planning to hold a music festival, Food Fight, with a variety of different talented local groups to help raise money for amnesty international the human rights organization. Hopefully we will teach all those youngins about the organization itself and all the people in the world who fall victim to human rights violations.
