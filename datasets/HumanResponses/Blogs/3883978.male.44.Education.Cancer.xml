      I no longer have the dissection class. And to those who have been reading my journal I know I have 3 days more to write about. I have them written in my paper journal just need soem tiem to myself to type it in here. I promise I will this week.  I started my 4th class of the summer.  Powerpoint. Taught by a guy and I mean no offense but you would expect to see this guy behind any 7elven cash register in the USA not a prof at a university. I have spent all day in this class 8am-4:30pm and I feel like one of my cadaers from last week.  If I had a scapple I would skin myself.  i could barely understand anything that came out of the man's mouth except for one LINE "IS THIS CLEAR WHAT I AM SAYING".  HOLY FUCKING COW!!!!!!!  I have 4 more days of this.  MY TWO WORSE NIGHTMARES BILL GATES MEETS GHANDI  MAKES ME WANT TO SLAUGHTER COWS!!!!!!!

      Couldn't wait to get started. Showed up 30 min. early.  Wheeled the bodies out. Pushing the gerny is like trying to control a shopping cart with a broken wheel. Thank god they are dead because I bashed their heads into the corner of the lab table as i wheeled them out. OUCH!   Finished working on the legs then soaked the muscles down with water packed them with dripping wet handy wipes and then tied the skin flaps closed.  then four of us pushed Zeus yes we named him Zeus, to the right side of the tableand flipped his stiff ridged body over onto his back.  One of the guys in my group was having a very hard time dealing with now that the body was face up. He said this was beacuse it was now more real that we were skinning a person becasue he now had a face.   I took care of that. I though a rag over Zeus's face. Now lets get to it.  I started to make a superfiscal vertical cut from his chin straight down his chest then abdomen around his navel. By the way he is an inny. All the way down to his pubic bone.  Then made a horizontal cut across his neck just above the clavicle, and another horizontal just below his ribs and the last horizontal cut across the pubic bone.  Again, I took the forsips and pull back teh skin exposing the fatty tissue. Cleaned off the fat exposing the muscles.  Pectoral major, Pectoral minor, and then to the Abs - Internal and external obliques, rectus abdominis (6 pack).   I finsihed up working on the front of the legs and the front of the arms.  Damn the more I do this work the hungerier I get.

      We came back from lunch.   Started on the legs.   1 cut down the center vertical cut from gluts to just below the ankle. 1 cut across the back of knee horizontal and then pull back the skin revealing the muscles underneath.  I will never look at a drumstick at Disneyworld the same way again.  Wow 4:00 pm already. Time to clean up. First we spray the body down with alcahol to prevent mold. The we covered the exposed muscles with wet handy wipes and fold the skin back over* and zied the body bag back up.  *We have been placing all the fatty tissue in a 30lb garbage bag, which we place between the cadavors legs when putting him to rest in the body bag.  * The following is a discription of how we started cutting or I should say dissection. This info is from  "Manual of Human Dissection" page 29.  For the dissection of the back, the body lies prone, with a block elevating the thorax, and the head hanging freely, (we did not use a block) so that the back of the neck is stretched. Certain surface points should be identified before the skin is reflected. in the midline at the base of the skull the EXTERNAL OCCIPITAL PROTUBERANCE. Laterally, behind the lower part of the auricle, is the MASTOID PROCESS. Arching between the external occipital protuberance and the amstoid on either side, the SUPERIOR NUCHAL LINE may be palpated. In th emedian like of the back, teh SPINOUS PROCESS of most of the vertebrae are apparent. The highest vertebral spine which is ordinarily palapable is that of the sixth cervical vertebra. The higher cervical spines are seperated from the skin by the LIGAMENTUM NUCHAE, a strong fibrous band which stretches in the median plane from the external occipital protuberance to the seventh cervical spine and is attached deeply to the spinous processes of all the cervical spine and is attached deeply to the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrae. Below the last lumbar psine, the posterior surface of the SACRUM is sucutaneous, and below it, between the buttocks, is the COCCYX. Identify also the CREST of the ILIUM, arching laterally from the posterior superior iliac spine. The posterior part of the iliac crest is often covered by a fairly thick layer of subcutaneous fat.  Locate the VEREBRAL BORDER OF the SCAPULA. Running laterally and upward from this border the SPINE OF the SCAPULA is subcautanious throughout its length. it ends in the broad ACROMION PROCESS, which forms the bony prominence of the shoulder.  When these points have been observed, make the following incisions through the skin: (1)a median longitudinal incision starting at the external occipital protuberance and ending at the tip of the coccyx; (2)from the upper end of the first incision, one laterally and downward across the back of the skull behind the ears to the mastoid process; (3)from the first incision, one at the level of the first lumbar spine upward and laterally to the posterior axillary fold and then along this fold the the back of the arm; (4)from the first incision, one at the level of teh seventh cervical spine straight laterally to the tip of the acromion; (5)from the lower end of the first incision, one upward and laterally to the posterior iliac spine and then along the iliac crest to the posterior axillary line. By these incisions, three large flaps of skin will be marked out on each side. These flaps should now all be reflected laterally.  The reflection of the skin will expose the SUPERFICIAL FASCIA of the back. It has no specific characteristics but resembles the superficial facia in other parts of the body. Before removing the superficial fasica, dissect some of the cutaneous nerves to demonstrate their segmental arrangement. Then reflect the superfical fasica, together with the deep fascia, in cleaning the superficial muscles of the back.  The CUTANEOUS NERVES of the back are derived from the POSTERIOR PRIMARY DIVISIONS of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal nerves. With the exception of the GREAT OCCIPITAL NERVE, they are small, but some of them will be seen peiercing the superficial muscles of theback in teh linear series not far lateral to the median line, as these muscles are cleaned.

      Day 1 - Get to class 10 min. early. Getting alittle nervous. As I sit 2 come in who were in my other classes at D-town. This proves it is a small world. Now when I say I am nervous I don't mean sick nervous, more like apprehensive. The Prof is cool. Very funny funny and very intellengent. I feel more at ease.  we wheel out teh 2 cadavors. Both are male. 1 died age 70 from lukemia on 12/12/03. The other died in Feb. of this year at the age of 85 form heart failure. I see myself in this one, skinny, bald, and a big nose. Is this foreshaddowing?  We opened the white body bags which have their cadavor #, sex, date of death and cause of death written in black sharpie. Next the sound of the zipper the bag is being opened leave me alittle unnerved at first.  They are in the supine position. Their faces were covered with a shroud. At first I am at teh 70yr old had to pull his feet free of the bag and check the number on the toe tag to make sure it matched teh number on the bag. They match.  Next we had to turn the cadavors over onto there stomachs. once the were turned, Oh had problem with his one arm got stuck under him, had to reach in and pull it free. Something I was told always happens cause of the body being so stiff. Once they were on their stomachs I lifted while the others push the body forward to get the head to hang over the end of the gerny. When this happened the preservative ran from their nose. A bucket comes in handy *make a note of this.  Double gloved my hands got a scapple and forsnips. made insissions (superficial) grabbed a corner of skin and pulled back exposing a layer of fatty tissue. *I will describe this dissection in detail later. Once we cleaned teh fatty tissue away the muscle was exposed in the neck, back and gluts. Damn I am starving, thank god it is time for lunch.

      Can one person be different on the internet and totally different in the real world? Why is it everyone thinks I am charming and sweet on the web but in the real world I am grumpy and an ass? Things that make you go hmmmmmmmmmmmm!
