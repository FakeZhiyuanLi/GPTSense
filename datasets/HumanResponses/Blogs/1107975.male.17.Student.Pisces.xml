      Woo! Weekend! Yes!!! Today has been good so far. My step-grandparents came over, and they're always a lot of fun to hang around with. Whoo....Besides that, it's been a normal day. I'm a touch bored, though...I'm gonna go mess with Paint. See ya later!

      Hmm...What to say...Well, today I didn't do too much. All I did was try to draw a TIE Interceptor(I'm a Star Wars geek), and not fall asleep in Algebra. Also, our theatre troupe, in the meeting yesterday, decided to do the play 'Juvie'. It sounds really good, and ought to be fun. Only problem is royalties. It's $50 to do one show, and $30 for each show afterwards...We don't have enough to do the two shows we want. But, I know we'll be able to raise enough money! ^_^ And, I've still not enough cajones to ask the girl I like out...Stupid me. Well, that's all, yes? Bye, now! ^___^;

      Hmm...Well, today was interesting. I had a theatre troupe meeting today, which was fun. But what wasn't was that my mom couldn't pick me up(stupid traffic), so I got a ride from a friend, and I came home to a seemingly-empty house. So, I beat on the door hopefully, and no one came. So, I stand there looking like a combonation idiot/wanna-be robber for 10 minutes, and then my 'brilliant' brother comes to the door. Evidently, he thoght I was already inside! How can anyone pound on the  outside  of the door when they're  inside?  Over-all, a bad, bad day, in more ways than one....Stupid traffic

I know you want to read them, but I don't have the time! So nyah!

      Hmm...Ok, I know...Two posts in one day is bad, but hey...Who cares, yes? Certinly not I! Ok...Now, these are things I'm making up as I type, so they WILL NOT rhyme!  Wind It swirls, it blows It tickles, it caresses It destroys, it terrorizes It rends, it flays skin from the body Wind   I'd say that's it for now, but who knows, yes? ~Evilmac

      Heylo! I know I've not updated this for a touch, but hey, I'm lazy. Deal. Ok, today was normal, but over-all unsatisfactory. I learned nothing in school, except that it's boring. Also, again with the no balls bit with the girl I like. I mean, I came uber-close today, just about to ask her, but she had to go. Sucks. -_- Anyways, that's it. See ya later

       Hokay. This is the first time in over  year  I've updated this sucker. So, I'll start anew, basically.     &nbsp;   Hi, I'm Shaun.    I'm 17, and looking forward to my 4th year in high school.    My interests are: My girlfriend, computers, cars, drawing, writing, and generally being stupid.    I'm in a theatre troupe at my school, called Chicken Wing Theatre. It's pretty cool.     &nbsp;   Also, I've got a deviantART account:  urlLink http://evilmac.deviantart.com , which means that I won't upload this often. So, since no one reads this, I'll be using it for rants...If anyone stumbles upon this? Prepare to have your eyes burned out     &nbsp;   --Out

       Umm...Yeah. I promised myself that I'd post in this some more, but again I lapse. I'ma try to make this an every-day thing, though. Just like I'ma try to turn working out into an everyday thing. But that's another story entirely.    &nbsp;  Anyway, today, even though it was my little brother's birthday(he turned three. Go him XD) mostly sucked. Around....12:00 pm, I got really freaking sick. Headache, right behind my eyes...And everytime I moved them, the pain got worse...Plus nausea, dizziness, and the entire left side of my neck is sore. Along with my back. But, then again, my back has been non-stop sore since March, when I was the Tech Director and threw my back out. Yes, I threw it out. Yes, I'm only 17. Hush.   But, and this is what worries me, it's gotten worse. Not better. And it's gotten worse a whole hell of a lot faster. Since then, the headache has moved to encompass my entire head, and now both shoulders are sore and I can barely stand, much less walk. But what do I care?  Anyway, I'm going to my girlfriend's house tomorrow morning. Hopefully I'll be feeling better by then  --Out
