      The other day on the way home from work, my daughter, sitting in her car seat in the back, says to me,  "Mommy, cut that light out!"  I look back to see she is pointing at the sun, squinting her eyes. I laugh and reply,  "Mommy can't turn that one out!"  She looks puzzled and starts singing along with the radio.&nbsp; Instantly, her attention was elsewhere, the sun forgotten.&nbsp; Children are such miracles, tiny beings of love and intellect sent to earth to teach us the meaning of life.&nbsp; I look at my daughter again, bobbing her head to the beat, and am taken aback by her trust and faith in me.&nbsp; To her I can do anything, soothe her scars, present her with sweet treats, rescue her from whomever or whatever is going to "get" her as she says, and even put out the sun!      How she depends on me!      What responsibility!  &nbsp;I would like think that her very existence depends on me but sometimes I'm not too sure.&nbsp;I think of the mom who left her 2 year old&nbsp;daughter alone in their apartment for something like 20 days. When the police found her, she was sitting in front of the TV naked, having eating all the food in the house that was within reach, including uncooked rice and spaghetti noodles.&nbsp; That mom should be burned at the stake.   I think about my own  mother  and cringe. There are too many unknowns. Where is she? Who is she? Why did she leave me? Is there ever a good answer to that question, Why did you leave me? Motherhood is a big responsibility and to just walk away from it like your child doesn't even exist is a different type of evil; infant sacrifice, throwing it into the gaping jaws of an unkind world.   We prepare to go out, I open the door to exit the apartment. My daughter comes running with her doll or her crayons and coloring book or her juice cup whatever she can see to grab. She looks up at me with her gigantic brown eyes,  "Don't leave me!"  My heart skips a beat, the words stab at my very soul.&nbsp; I manage to speak,  "I'm not leaving you. Come on, let's go."  She runs past me out onto the landing and turns to wait for me at the top of the steps. Her expression is one of puzzlement again. No doubt she cannot figure out why mommy has tears in her eyes.

      I have eaten, within the past two weeks,   4   watermelons.&nbsp; Now for someone who rarely ever touches the stuff, I find this amazing. I have fallen completely in love with the ripe, red, sweet, juicy goodness.&nbsp; I love the way it feels when I pop a chunk in my mouth. . .&nbsp;cool&nbsp;flesh collapses between my tongue and the roof of my mouth. . .&nbsp;there is a crushing sound as the sweet juices gush out .&nbsp;. .then I start in on this rhythm of chewing and sucking, chewing and sucking, chewing and sucking. . . Its ecstacy! Who knew fruit could do that! WOW!   Not wanting to add to the age old sterotypes regarding black folks and their foods of choice,&nbsp; I do not eat collard greens or chitterlings, so don't even go there.

      Last night, I dreamed that I was living back a home and Mekhi Phifer came to my house to pick me up for a date! I don't know  where  that came from! I mean, Mekhi Phifer&nbsp;is not on my&nbsp;  hit list   by&nbsp;any means. The subconscious is&nbsp;CRAZY!  &nbsp;  If nothing else, this just proves all to well how love starved I am right now.&nbsp; I moved out of my old apartment on July 2. Prior to that, my husband had moved out about two weeks before and prior to that I can't even recall the last time I had sex.&nbsp; My husband was always pushin' up on me but at that stage I found him so disgusting, I couldn't even look at him without gagging!&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is getting harder by the day to&nbsp;ignore that&nbsp;yearning&nbsp;ache the&nbsp;keeps growing&nbsp;and growing like wildfire.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;am praying for strength not to pounce on the first scrub that asks me for my number just to quench this thirst and end up&nbsp;feeling cheap and filthy the morning after.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adults Only late night Showtime and Cinemax featurettes&nbsp;are not helping either! Masturbation, while quick and easy, is far from the real thing. Damn! Now I really understand the whole can't live with 'em/without 'em cliche.  &nbsp;  Today marks the 35th anniversary of the "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" thing on the moon.&nbsp; A few years ago, I did some research on the hoax scenario and it was pretty convincing.&nbsp; Its no secret that our government is run by a bunch of blue blood liars so I wouldn't put it past them that the whole scene was staged at a remote location on&nbsp;the infamous Area 51.  &nbsp;  Precincts are open today. People are scurrying to proudly&nbsp;cast their ballots while I personally don't see the point. If I don't like any of the candidates and feel that their are all in it for the paycheck and their own personal motives, who do I vote for?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        I often catch myself eyeing the dinnette that sits so beautifully in my new place or gazing dreamily at the massive bed so exquisitely made beside the quaint iron table and linen-shaded lamp .&nbsp; Save a few errant pieces here and there, they are all that remain.&nbsp; I see them as remnants of a bygone era, a lost dynasty, the only treasures to survive the fall of the kingdom that was my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the dethroned and exiled&nbsp;queen who cannot come to grips and remove her crown.&nbsp; In Wal-mart,&nbsp; I sail up and down the aisles in haughty abandon, well mannered and well groomed, sneering in disgust at any man who may dare to favor me with his compliments.   Then, lying in bed in the dark, the utter alone-ness assaults me.  There in the dark, when even&nbsp;grand gestures and a beautiful four-chair dinnette cannot save me, I surrender to reality.  Perhaps soon, I will be able to rebuild, to create a home in this carpeted expanse of freedom but for now, the gaping emptiness reminds me often of another place and the things that filled it.    It is true that in some sense I am enthralled in the tangles of materialistic reminiscence but truth be told, it is not the things I long for but the meaning behind those things. &nbsp; The absence of the furniture, the trinkets, the knick-knacks taunts me, mocks me, tells me constantly that I am no longer what I strived so hard to be and makes me doubt the sensibility of this decision that has placed me back at the beginning of the game with only one life left.    But then I gaze out of my sunroom window to the brown creek floating peacefully by between banks carpeted with kudzu and feel so blessed to be here in this place at this time to experience such beauty.  The splendor of life had become so faded, so dim, beneath the glare of dysfunction that hovered over me like one of those cartoon-ish rain clouds.&nbsp; Now, through new eyes, rain drips from the sky like diamonds and massages from the earth the scent of hot summers and sweet mud pies.&nbsp; The sun rises to kiss me awake and pours laughter over me as I depart home for work.&nbsp; Put into perspective, a sofa and a big screen TV lose their appeal and are replaced by an unfamiliar yet comforting brand of happiness.&nbsp; The world has been revealed to me once again, I am in awe of its splendor.&nbsp; The absence of mere trinkets could never overshadow this brilliant feeling that has been awakened in my heart.&nbsp;    I cast down my crown, scoff at my relics and turn my face toward the magnificent day.   &nbsp;

      I settled on Long John Silver’s for lunch yesterday.  Something in me craved fish just as I was passing the entrance and I turned in.  After sitting for a mini-eternity in the drive through line, I was finally prompted for my order.  At the window, a man with a gigantic stomach demanded my payment and asked if I wanted any sauces for my order, which ended up being fish, fries and a side of what appeared to be shrimp.   I said, “Tarter Sauce, Malt Vinegar and Cocktail Sauce, please,” in that plain, articulate speech of mine and as I pulled away inspecting the contents of the plastic grocery sack I had been handed, I came upon several packets of hot sauce along with the other condiments I had requested.  Now, maybe it’s just me, but I found the presence of un-asked for hot sauce in my bag to be disturbing.  Did the walrus working the drive through lane get some sick satisfaction in assuming that I, a black female, would slather my fish and shrimp in hot sauce while sitting bare foot on a front porch somewhere digging my toes in the soil?  Is there some unspoken rule that all the black folks want hot sauce even if they don’t ask for it because they’re all going to wolf it down?   How ridiculous! But like I said, maybe it’s just me.

       Is the  moon in the third house  and therefore causing strange, unexplainable events to play out in my life? Is someone tucked away in a dark basement casting hoo-doo spells to vex me at every turn? Perhaps getting this out there will counteract whatever the heck it is.  I’ll explain:  The conversation with my brother was cut short by an incoming call on his line and he left me with the promise to contact me later. That was Friday.  Am I missing something or have I just been PUNKED!?!?   And if that wasn’t weird enough, JH bites the dust. Yes, for those of you who were rooting for success as I took my first unsure steps back onto the dance floor, I am sorry to report that I broke a leg, literally. But better that than my heart!  Here’s the abbreviated version: During a recent visit to the city, he was apparently made uncomfortable by my frequent, irritating and ominous phone calls from my soon-to-be ex-husband.  Now, he advised that I should take the calls.   This was the only reason I accepted the calls in the first place.  Instincts told me that the sane thing to do while in the company of my new friend was to turn the phone off completely. Now, I’m torn. I don’t know whether to be hurt or mad or neither. Was I being inconsiderate, even while following JH's cues, to engage in several, sometimes volatile, conversations with my soon-to-be ex-husband? Is JH behaving like a spoiled child, giving advice that he doesn’t even support once it is played out?  Call me crazy but I find that to be the lamest thing I have ever heard of. I think there is something more to this, kinda like some joke is being played and everyone knows about it but me! Especially after he carries on about being so sensitive and real and down to earth. This is neither of those things. This is "snatch your heart out of your chest and crush it with my bear hands while you writhe around on the floor" crazy!   PUNKED AGAIN !    Oh, and did I mention that he waited until he returned home to express these feelings to me via IM the next day? What of that? I, for one, am the type to address things as they arise when the opportunity presents itself, not stew over them and expose my true feelings at a later date.     Fuck it. Life goes on.    (*SIGH*) As I told him, perhaps it is too soon for this. His response (via IM) was literally “Ok, Bye!” The sad thing is. . .I was really (REALLY) feeling him. I’ve never been the type to take temporary dips into the shallow end of the relationship pool. For me it is always a head first dive in the deep. From the first hello, down I’d go, and then deeper and deeper with every soft spoken word, every crooked, playful smile, every good-bye kiss, every longing touch, every passionate thrust. . . With him, I was already beginning to lose sight of the surface, so yes, perhaps it was time to come up for air. (*INHALE*)  Most importantly, with the brevity of this encounter taken into consideration, I’ve discovered something new about myself. As this man turns and slams the door in my face, I am not left feeling empty or lessened in anyway. I am not wondering what I could have done or searching for imperfections within myself to solve the mystery of why I didn’t make the team. I am smart, damn near brilliant, with a heart the size of Texas and a killer smile. His loss. I am not brimming with the tears of the rejected, the dejected. It just did not work out. Period. And for once in my life, I can accept that.   Too bad though, we could have been really, REALLY good together!

        At about the time our original 13 states adopted their new constitution, in the year 1787, Alexander Tyler (a Scottish history professor at The University of Edinborough) had this to say about "The Fall of The Athenian Republic" some 2,000 years prior.   "A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship."   "The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:   1) From Bondage to spiritual faith  2) From spiritual faith to great courage  3) From courage to liberty  4) From liberty to abundance  5) From abundance to complacency  6) From complacency to apathy  7) From apathy to dependence  8)From dependence back into bondage    Where do you think present day America stands in this flow?

       I have been in my new place for 1 month and 1 week today  (applause).  Toward the end of last week, I began to sink into a state of utter melancholy that had worsened daily since the departure of my sister last Sunday. She had been here since I moved in and her presence had been priceless as I became acclimated to this new way of life. On Monday, I went home to find the place empty and lifeless. There was no one to chit -chat and pass the time with, no one to opinionate on the many tough decisions that I make daily, no tennis partner, no designated driver and no impromptu baby sitter  (waaaaaaaaa!) .  For the first time since the move, I was totally on my own. My daughter seemed to launch a second wave of attacks in her mission to “run mama crazy” and my appetite left almost completely (probably the only good thing in all this). The five to six phone calls and countless back and forth instant messages from JH (more on him later) helped but   “me, myself and I, that’s all I got in the end.”   I too, Beyonce, found this out.  This past weekend was a true awakening as I stretched out completely in this new skin of freedom. Gone was the loneliness, the melancholy. I was a single woman, enjoying her weekend with her child, a role I have seemed to step into gracefully. However, I am disturbed by the fact that the only legitimate reason I can find to leave my house is to spend money, money which, of course, I do not have. Both Saturday and Sunday, stricken with the desperate need to get out into the beautiful weather, I got jazzed up and went first to the mall, then sadly, to Family Dollar. If I keep this up, I will be in the poor house for sure.   But what’s a girl to do when her phone does not ring once all day and her daughter is literally bouncing off the walls with pent up energy?   I’m not the visiting type, you know, the person who is always at someone else’s house. Beside, everyone I know is at least a good 30 minutes away and the gas alone would equal a few small items at the mall! What a quandary. Single people of the world, unite. . .and give a sista some words of wisdom on how to fill her free hours without filing for bankruptcy!  Back to JH, yes, a he. He has 30 (almost 31) years to my 24, is a giant of a man, tall, broad shouldered with biceps like anacondas, makes me feel  small  (wow!,) could have been a bouncer, easily, or a police officer, but chose the military instead, has a similarly disturbing past that adds even more to the attraction that draws me to him, lives far enough away that he is not instantly accessible but not completely out of reach either, has two children, 12 and 7, is country as hell in a  “test me and I’ll fuck your shit up”  sorta way, drives an old-school, drop top Chevy, calls when he says he will, keeps it real even as I blush, makes me smile even laugh out loud for real not just the LOL I may type, makes me wonder if its too soon for this, makes me glad to know him, and hungry to know more. He stirs in me feelings that I thought were long dormant never to rise again. This makes me both excited and nervous. In this new, vulnerable state of my life, one can never be too cautious.     Is it too soon?     Am I setting myself up?       Will he break my heart?     WILL HE BREAK MY BACK!?!?!?!?       LOL!!!  I guess only time will tell.

      I was sitting at my desk today trying to IM discreetly while listening for footsteps of people coming into or passing by my cubicle, when my cell phone rang, (ring tone of the moment: Turn Me Up, Kevin Lyttle) Lo and Behold!  It was my brother!    Quick history lesson:  My father and my brother’s mother were married back in the sixties.  Before their break up, they produced two children; a girl followed by a boy.   By the time I was born in ’80, they were no longer together.  Apparently, my father was less than pleased with the next woman to bear his seed so he took me from my mother and moved me to Vidalia, Georgia (home of the sweet onion) where his mother assisted him in raising me, that is, until he hit the highway on one of his numerous misadventures.  My brother and sister grew up with their mother in Columbus, Georgia and we have seen each other probably three times since I’ve been alive.  There was some underlying tension between their family and mine, I still don’t know what the deal is, even to this day, but anyway, what black family doesn’t have skeletons in their closets laughing their heads off at our fruitless search for the truth.  I’m not losing any of my much needed sleep behind it.  I would hear tales of their whereabouts, their lives, through one sided telephone conversations and kitchen whispers and when I graduated and came to Atlanta (1998), I spoke to my brother on the phone long enough to learn that my sister was living in an Atlanta suburb) and that he had a daughter (my neice! wow!) in the area as well.  We never met up and did not speak again until about two months ago at my grandmother’s funeral.  Both my brother and sister showed up for the funeral.  My sister brought her whole family, husband, daughter, son, plus a few aunts and cousins and my brother was accompanied by his wife.  Believe me, I was having a serious Color Purple experience!  We exchanged numbers but did not engage in much conversation.  The funeral was back in June and I still had not gotten up courage to call either of them when all of a sudden, today, my brother calls out of the blue.    The conversation was casual, a lot of dodging around the fact that we are not brother and sister like most siblings and in fact are just two people who happen to share a father.  There was slight reminiscence bordering on anger and the foul hand we had been dealt.  He longs to know our father, the man I grew up with until his death when I was eight.  He was particular interested in whether grandmother had a will because she would often comment (I remember her saying this) that if anything happened to her, the three of us would never have to want for anything.  I just scoffed at this and could not fathom her, in her dilapidated accommodations and meager lifestyle, the type of granny who would sit on a small fortune until her death.  Besides, I wonder at my brother choice of topic for this our first real conversation in years.  Perhaps he was just picking me for information. Perhaps his intentions are genuine.  I guess now only time will tell. If anyone has any feedback from a similar situation, this would be a good time to let a sista know! Thanks.

      Today, I am coming to you completely off the cuff. Lets start with a few updates for those who are following the soap opera that has become my life:  - - - Regarding JH, the smoke has cleared, we've called a truce. No one wins. No one loses.  - - - Still no word from my "suddenly" sibling. I left a voicemail. No response. Yes, I was definitely   PUNKED!   It was probably Ashton Kutcher on the line to begin with!  - - - My daughter's monthly daycare fee has now increased to almost $70 more than my than my monthly rent! In true  urlLink broke sister fashion , I am now considering moving into the daycare! Can one of you no job or husband having, Gucci-bad toting, multiple children parenting, Section-8 having sisters please send me some pointers on how to beat the system! I applied for daycare assistance with the state and according to them, my income (a good $3 above the poverty line if you ask me) is TOO HIGH (rolling on the floor laughing) and to qualify, I would have to be supporting myself and oh, THREE kids! If I had THREE kids, we would all be standing in line and the Atlanta Union Mission and would not need daycare assistance.  urlLink    - - - My company will be taking a retreat to the  urlLink North Georgia mountains  in October. While the idea of being "close to nature" is appealing, the whole "lodge chic" complete with quilted bedding complemented by wood, wood, and more wood, really cramps my ultra-modernist/ghetto fabulous style.  - - - Be sure to check  urlLink him  out! Love the brother's passion for words and his sincerity.  - - - Me on an "I feel pretty" day!        More literarily credible posts to come,    I PROMISE   ! I just felt like being a silly girl today!    BLOGGER ALERT !  BLOGGER ALERT ! -  For those who want to add pics to their postings (like the above), I've found a really easy and FREE *appluase, applause* photo hosting site -  urlLink www.imageshack.us . Just register, upload your pics, and click "Host it!" You will get a URL to add into the body of your blog. You have to publish it first, then go back in and edit (change size, move, etc.) the actual photo (all you will see at first is the URL.)
