       with text RPGs?  How do they cram such evil difficulty into ASCII output?  GAH!  Besides, they never let me do what I want.  e.g~~  You enter CAVE.  Obvious exits are NORTH, EAST, SOUTHWEST, TROY.  What do you do?  :TROY  TROY says hello.  Obvious exits are NOT TROY.  :ASK TROY ABOUT QUEST  I don't know what you mean.  :SAY TO TROY "WHAT ABOUT THIS QUEST"?  I don't know what you mean.  :GRRR!  JUST LEAVE!  I don't know what you mean.  :NOT TROY  ad nauseum.  This has inspired me to make a text rpg of my own, and make it at least as good as "Hunt the Wumpus." hehehehe.  Wumpus.  :PUBLISH POST  I don't know what you mean.  :AAAAAAAAH!!!!!  trlblzr  p.s.  check out the new avatar.  Executive office chair + kitty = good times indeed

       i'm speechless.  well, maybe not.  we got out early from band camp! O_O  you may have noticed that i've been writing about nothing besides band camp lately.  here's why:  i'm on my feet usually at least 7 hours a day, sometimes up to 10.  With barely enough breaks for lunch and supper, i'm basically commited to band camp for 13 hours a day.  now you now.  shoot, i never got that pudding...*light bulb* idea!!  i'll give you some random fact, or word, or something in japanese on each of my blog posts to share my enlightenment.  (hehe)  Japanese word of the day/week/entry/whatever:  プディング pudingu  that's katakana, the more angular of nihongo's 2 phonetic alphabets.  katakana's used for 'borrowed' words, like pudding.  tee hee.  trlblzr

       our band camp staff is gone; hooray for less strictness, but our director (name witheld to protect him from adoring mobs of fangirls, errr...maybe not... hehe :)  is going to get himself  all stressed out.  I can understand why, we're going to BOA Grand Nationals in Indy! w00t.  Anyway, I'm gonna go get some pudding...then back to the ol' grind.  Today I finished Driver's Ed.  yay!  I can get my license in October.  I did well even in my band shoes! >_  バイ (Bai for those of you without japanese skillz)  trlblzr

       I got Linux installed, finally.  Anyway, I'm off to Driver's Ed/Band Camp, but then again most everyone who reads this also will be.  trlblzr

       and I've been sitting inside for almost 2 hours.  Don't ask me.  Tonight marks the last night of free time for me.  :'(  Band camp is fun, but not fun enough make me want to spend more time there than my dad does at his job in a factory.  Working overtime. >_  I 'fixed' someone's computer today, meaning I tried futily to rescue a 3.5 year old piece of junk that hasn't had virus protection since 2001.  I don't know what people are thinking.  Oh well, I'm going back Saturday or Sunday to try and finish up, hopefully I'll get it.  I'm going to go wallow in depression, i.e. read a funny book.  trlblzr

       OK, I've had this computer (my main one) since Easter.  I was going to install Linux on it when I got a second hard drive.  Problem #1:  I'm impatient. Problem #2:  I'm poor.  Do you see where I'm coming from?  I see on  urlLink Slashdot  that Mandrake has come out with a new version.  Or I might install Fedora.  That's not the point.  Everyone (well, everyone who has installed Linux dual-boot on one drive) knows that you have to defragment your hard drive before you partition it.  So I did.  It took all night.  (Well, until after I went to bed.)  There was still a chunk of data at the end.  FSCK!  I tried it again.  And again.  And again.  IT WON'T MOVE.  Now, you may be saying "It's probably unmovable, I've seen that before" but it's colored blue, not green like unmovable data.  Grr.  I'm thinking about just partitioning it anyway.  It can't be that important if it's at the end of the drive, right? ;)  I fail to see why Windows still uses a fragmenting filesystem.  They upgraded from FAT to FAT32, giving support for large drives.  Then to NTFS, with added quotas and other assorted doodads.  Linux, with it's many filesystem options, doesn't fragment.  None of them.  ext2, ext3, ReiserFS.  (OK, so they *do* fragment, but not so much that it impedes performance.)  Oh well.  trlblzr

       That pretty much sums up my day so far.  I cleaned up my hard drive, and went from 2.something GB free to over 23 gigs free.  :D  97.2% of everything I deleted was anime.  Odd.  :/  I officially have 48.5 hours of free time left this summer, minus sleeping time plus weekends off from band camp.  Of course, I'm not looking forward to it, but it'll be a blast once it starts.  Hopefully.  I have nothing else I need to do this summer.  Isn't that a great feeling?  I finished my summer reading book for english, well, that was all I had to do anyway.  Never mind, it's done!  I was looking through my profile and searching some of my stranger interests.  I'm the only person on Blogger who has expressed an interest in canned air.  How odd is that?  Not very, if you ask me.  For the umpteenth time in a row, Family Video has been out of Tales of Symphonia.  No wonder.  It's only the best game to come out for GameCube in recent years, and they only got one copy.  I guess the cube's 3 panels already take up too much of PlayStation and PS2's 4 aisles.  I hate Family Video.  I hate Wal-Mart too.  The past 3 relatively good cube games haven't even touched Wally World's shelves.  I almost hate to say it, but if I could have seen the future 2 years ago when I got my cube, I wouldn't have.  I would have gotten a PS2, namely for the masses of RPGs.  And the fact that people carry games for it.  Nintendo better do great things with the next console.  Speaking of Wal-Mart, my cat is fat.  Extremely fat.  trlblzr

       All it has on it now is Pong.  You can play it, or download it for a GBA Emulator  urlLink here.  Pardon the choppiness, if there is any, the actual game is smoother than that.  BTW, the music wasn't done my me, I found it at MODArchive and it's called junkf00d.  I couldn't resist.  trlblzr  Edit: My bad, the applet emulator doesn't have sound, you'll have to get one that does to experience all that is Pong 2.0!

       Well, since I took down my server for some extra knee room,  I no longer had a blog.  Not that it really mattered to me.  But hey, anything affiliated with Google has got to be worth a try, ne?  Um, if you have an opinion about stuff I post, or just feel like exercising your fingers, please leave a comment.  If you don't, I might just abandon this blog too.  I had cashew chicken at First Wok today.  Yum.  In other news, I finished Pong 2.0.  It's more like Pong 1.01, because I only added background music and a clicky sound when you bounce the ball.  Oh well, Pong 2.0 sounds better.  trlblzr
