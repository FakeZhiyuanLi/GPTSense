						            Today is my unlucky day! i handed in my phy file long long long time ago to e stupid chung lee xiang but today, she told me tt i nv hand in. wat e meaning of this???? I handed it to my rag last week and numerous ppl hav seen my file in her pigeon hole and all of a sudden, its gone!? worse still, it contribute to my this term phy mark.5%. a grade. damn it. Hu on earth is this sicko hu go abt stealing my file. Btw im e only hu has my file stolen!!!!!!! e rest of my class files r still there but not mine......... is it a ghost playing a plank on me or a bloody asshole or  one of my enemies??? but e problem is tt chung refuse to give me mark unless she sees e file... i feel like crying!!:'(. its not my fault la... y am i so unlucky!!! Now i hav to photocopy e entire file of abt 500 pages!!! Oh holy...

						             Yo! Today is e first training after e nationals. E Mr Wong ask us to do 8km easy or less.Kind of useless la.haha. But after tt, we have  a game of soccer la. it was damn fun cause its e sec 3 and wong vs the sec 1 &amp; 2. But we sec 1 seem to be ramming us wif the ball instead of trying to score. HAHA!!! Stupid sec1 and sec2. We gonna rammed in e face, butt and many more. but e the best part is e Timothy or whoever go and rammed the coach twice in a row. HaHA. nice one!!!!! how i wish i can ram him as well.( sadistic fellow???) But e game is type of messy as we have to continuous sub ppl in or out.y???? crosss- country fellows getting leg cramp. hahaha. abt three or four of us... WEak???
