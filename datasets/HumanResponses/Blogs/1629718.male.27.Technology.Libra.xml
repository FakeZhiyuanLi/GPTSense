      Today all in all is a good day, financial wise i'm doing..stable.. but then again thats what unexpected car repairs will do to your pocket book, literally fark em up bad. I have $7.50 to last me for gas until friday...which i'm crossing my fingers that will be enough to get to point A and B.  Taking out a Loan to help things out hasn't done much of a lick to make life easier..and it seems all the bills are due on the 15th..yet another nightmare... I'm content and know that in a few weeks, everything will be straightned out...and money, will be at equal amounts, and maybe, I could survive on more better things.  Lena just called, seems I have to pickup my years supply of contacts today, my eyes are watery and it seems like i'm wearing the ones I have in my eyes out bad, but it'll be nice to see clearly , yet , once again. I head to LA on friday, which I'm not really all that excited about, but hopefully accomplishing one thing through the whole deal, and thats getting myself finalized and GONE from the X. Tired and sick of the thought of even having anything to do with her, more less taking part of her crazy lifstyle of constant bickering and cheap liquor in her front yard.   When I was growing up families had values, and you would do anything to make them work, but for that family, it seems like an endless task to make another $1 off of someone not wanting to be with your cheap, lame, ass. And collecting some more wellfare. I can't wait till she has to work, wait...the State will take care of that as well *shrugs*   Hmm dinner tonight sounds good, think i'm gonna hammer into some butter noodles or spegetti, misspelt, i suck..yes I know. As well as watch some tv, yank some jams outta the plastic box thats my proclaimed life, and sit and compromise about the situations i'm fixing to face.   I miss Rosie though, seems like the past few times we've gone places we've always had a blast, from Walmart to Taco Bell...it always seems like we're up to no good, and I love that! I miss it! :)   Well i'm finished yet once more...but for how long.... thats something we'll never know....

      Wow kids, take a look at your local gas pump, or shall i say pimp, it seems now its costing you more locally to fill that tank, then it would tankin your girlfriends mother. Why? Well let us see... due to stupid wars in IRAQ the oil industry has something to bitch and complain about, and who ends up paying more at the pump, you do... Today I heard that Oklahoma is taking to the senate a bill that would raise our gas tax more...(are you friggen kiddin me?), and on top of that Oklahoma is footin and approving to tax 50 cents more per pack of smokes.   Lay off the TAXES, and give us a break... while you drive your nice LEXUS and Caddy's. My salute to you Mr Bush, I'd tank ya in the swamp before i'd cast another vote.

      Today's been pretty good considering the headlines of things going on around us are crazy, lets take for example what's going on in the latest of craze when people see a movie and start acting stupid , stating that the movie changed them, therefore it's time to confess that I nuked a SOB and goto jail? Wake UP! Let us look @   urlLink Yahoo Oddly Enough News  And there's more where that crap came from.   Do yourself a favor..save the popcorn and 10 bucks it costs to see the damn movie and just head straight to the local jail... it works, and it's less expensive, after all we all enjoy prision food, and admitting were stupid right after a movie, that of all people, mel gibson (I do remember all his movies such as lethal weapon, etc, included VULGARITY), would produce. Let us think, its not about 'touching others' for free..it's about money, and if mel was so advertly a clearly christan man, he would be donating at least 3/4 to the churches...wait...I'm yet to see that....  Well more picking on others later... if you have any comments, by all means feel free to email me admin@wickeddreams.net and don't forget your movie pass.

      How many times must we go through this, once again, a few more soldiers blown to pieces, yet another family man not being able to spend his last holidays with his family. Is this war really worth it? Or have we made a mistake just like vietnam...well let us clap for Bush, i mean he did catch Sadam but, um..last time i checked the 9/11 attacks were from Osama...thats wild... And don't you think its time to pack the crap up and leave? Before you turn around and find out the body of your relative or friend is being burned and dragged a million miles too?

I'm no longer empty anymore.....Thank you to everyone for their support and helping me legally get my daughter back, all i can say without wiping a tear is, paperwork speaks, and standing up for yourself before a judge does too...

      Things that make us wonder at times is the past relationships we had. In my experience as a mad sexoligist in relationships, i often wondered was it good to rank head or rank income? Let us investigate with Wicked..come on kids!  The names have been changed of past hoes to protect the people with the names that are not hoes, hell your not a hoe, am i? nah i'm a manwhore..but if your a hoe cool...lets move on.  Income vs head is a prospecting idea, venture, and yet a standard of living. If your in a relationship and the situation bases income over getting head, don't bitch i suppose, but head is nice...but if she aint given is she giving to your neighbor? Let us ask...  Dr Ruth states... if the biatch dont toss dont get mad make her slide that mad puppy where it dont belong... so why is it that the performace of others rank in our minds? Well my x sucked at doing things..hell I remember one time if i asked for head, she pertained the thought to cleaning the bathroom and abused me, punched me in the eye, and made me cry.  Let us play some debbie gibson to clear our minds, okay from hell this study went to hell when chewy my dog decided to go fark some other puppy and run away with gold chains on his neck, freak ROLEX ! Damn the man! DAMNIT! their goes my subject for pyscological questioning... i was going to study him for the replies on the females perspective..ah fark.   which brings me to the next level is michael jackson a male/female or a tranvestite locked in a mans body... he loves good luvin and you love it too... did he abuse you? If so shame shame... lets sue the Riaa..fark em! They fark you! For Killin sakes DONT share the MOVIES! Fuckit!  Okay im off the subject but we dont have one now, see OU im smart, i sit and utilize my time doing useless things, i'll fit fine in your programs and twiddle my dong endlessly... hmmm did you poke today?  Let us all get dropped kicked at resturants in ada that are chinese ones that suck, man whip out the fucken nubchucks and make us hide, and give us free cookies... and charge us! Anally abused i swear! someone hide my ass!  Lemme drive ya to the store in my pimp ride that breaks down 1/2 there and we have to push the car the rest of the way, cuz it goes like that, you love me peoples, friggen admit it, ya freaks.  And if i find another sex bar on another pc i'm gonna go nuts, wait did you go nuts? hell the popups suck but wack wack! you love it dontcha! lemme install 2 more freakit!   Ok this is useless my study showed that I get laid alot and you dont, i watch happy tree friends and i pimp my car, and i dont have credit, so i rule..end of case!

      Sure we've all had our times for wondering how the hell to get out of bed..but did you know that Amp Energy Drink from Mt Dew is the answer to all your hellish waking up days? If so don't be fooled, there's a drink even higher up on the tot'em pole then that for sending your energy to another planet, hell even my fiance' thinks so.  I would have to rank a few drinks on the market in this order:  1 - Monster Energy (a pounding hellish 2000+ MG of caffine per drink, not more then 3 a day recommended) ***** 5/5 -- Made me wanna climb a friggen wall, then a moutain, then the tv, and then go fix my car when I know nothing about mechanics - Cost $2.20 for 40 Oz Can (Woohoo!)  2 - MT Dew Amp - **** 5/5 - Peaceful Luv Energy Drink - Sure a cheap chip off of monster energy once again, but it does the job, and it's 20 cents less! , still makes me do nutty things, hmmm wonder if this is addictive? Cost = $1.99 for 8.4 Oz Can (Rippoff?)  3 - Pure Luv Mini - **** 4/5 - Mini size of pure love, you can score two for like $1.99, not a bad deal, better hose down both of em they seem to sweeten the kick, sadly these had only  75 mg of caffine in each can :(   4 - Red Bull - ** 2/5 - Wtf is this junk? This can't even spark my mind, nor send me racing through a cardboard box, I'v had more energy nibblin on friggen sour patchies with my fiance at midnight half awake. This stuff should be labeled - Kiddie Sooper Shooter Drink and given at McDonald's in their kiddie meals. And for $2.XX !! It's not worth it. Cost = $1.99 8.4 Oz Can.  Well that concludes my day of rantin on about energy drinks...maybe i'll post more later. Maybe I won't ..ah what the hell...  W|CKED

      Today has gone great, though I plan on cleaning the house tonight all in all the day has gone good.  Last night was different, for once I actually went to bed at a decent hour and woke up at 2:30 in the morning, ate some chicken fettucini and then went back to bed, waking up just in time to get my butt to work. LOL. How close things are sometimes scares me, but this week has drug by the toes and it's nice to have the weekend off.  I do miss having one day here a week, then one here off as well. But dog gone it, it's not like I accomplish anything on the 2 days im off for the weekend, more less the 5 days that I work. LOL I love the car, its so pretty, blue like the sky, its my baby! Finally nice to have something new, and not be Poor! LOL like I would ever be anyways, even if I didn't lift a finger, it always seems like money comes to me from friendliness and computers *L*  Summertime is almost over, look at this crap, and i havent even gone swimming but once, or bbq'd outside but maybe 2 times since the summer.  What a crapper. I think im gonna spend like a weekend and go camping, reguardless of who comes or not, I havent spent anytime doin anything outdoors this summer (insert boo hoo here) *L*  Welp i'm out ...more blogging later i suppose lol

I'm kinda lavish for the taste of the chicken whopper, its just so damn good, but for 5 bucks a meal, it seems to be gettin a lil expensive. Yup br.king it is, i'll read the paper too...whit whew how i rock lol.  Well im off peace!  WCKED  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      When you get caught in the rain with no where to run  When you're distraught and in pain without anyone  When you keep crying out to be saved  But nobody comes and you feel so far away  That you just can't find your way home  You can get there alone  It's okay, what you say is  I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I'm strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day and I make it through the rain  And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in  You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly  And you'll find what you need to prevail  What you say is   I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I'm strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day and I make it through the rain   And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid  There's nothing you can't face  And should they tell you you'll never pull through  Don't hesitate, stand tall and say   I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I'm strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day and I make it through the rain   I can make it through the rain  And I live once again  And I live one more day  And I can make it through the rain  (Yes you can)  You will make it through the rain

Yes! You will see more of Subway commercials singing "your kids a fat bastard, be like jerrod! eat fresh!"   For someone that should jump off a bridge, I'd throw him right next to my xwife.  -W|CKED

               Fark BUSH! He Blows My NaDS!       urlLink     Another joyful addition to my useless sack of ramblin crap on this earth of oh god loviness for the fine thursday of hell almighty! Since it's only 4:16 here, I have a few more hours before grabbin my bag of stinkin ass laundry and hope that it cost less then a cheap hooker on a nyc street side.   After all you can only turn your pants inside out 2 times right? or will anyone justify that you can do it another way...  Today I heard the suggestion from a college student here in ADA that when they can't afford laundry they do it in thier bathtub? What the hell is this crap? How do you dry it I kindly asked ... Oh easy, you put it on the cieling fan and flip in on high , thats after you secure it with clothespins..wow this cheapskate really took some though into this, maybe i should save him the hellish view of living life as it is and bash him with a glass picture of koolaid on his forehead. After all the is Ada right?  So here goes my fanmail i'v saved up for a few months, yes todays the day to unveil why not couldn't be a better day!    urlLink     Dear Wicked,    After reviewing your website I noticed you put alot of self gradification into how good you are, what about all the rest of us? Why do you take credit for the design of the website when it's truly the work of someone else? And why are you tapping on poor people when you know your one as well?  -Jack ( urlLink Jack1@xx.com )  Dear Jack,   After reviewing your email it reminds me of how much better I am at self gradification and how much your religious view of how people are classified as poor and inexperienced relate to beer drinking / guzzlin hobo's kicked around by us better people on New York City Streets.  We all need to talk highly about ourselves, even though in due time it seems that you are 10, you will grow up, and as for ripping off websites, sure copyright it, but even elvis can't keep free people from sucking his funds dry for old lp's. Move on, and why your at it get off comcast, they suck.  -  Dear Wicked,   I thought you cared alot about your past? What happened to your daughter you loved so much and tried for? What about now?  -B (referred by your xwife)    urlLink    Dear B,    I surely how do honoribly shall bow before you and the rest of the world to express the flaws in the judicial system, and how much paperwork can do if someone gets off their fat ass and quits flying trips back and forth to california, one could afford a reasonible meal for the family. Funny as it seems, I do love my daughter, I send her things, and yet through many months of sending items , I haven't YET to recieve a colored picture of barney, more less a audio cassette tape or a video. So maybe one wouldn't be poor if one got a job? Oh wait! That'll never happen! Best wishes! I'll be playing my Xbox and watching my big screen tv thinking of you! As for my daughter, I'll continue to send things, as for the things i'll ever get back like a normal parent should, i'm still waiting. As for trips it seems like i have to do the 100%. Seems like someone doesn't own a car as well. Have a beer on me! Buddy!  -WCKED   urlLink     More to come....

      Seems like nothing works at times, here i am barely enough money to do laundry, i'm gonna get a load done so i have some clothes to wear to work tommorrow and something to pack when i goto oklahoma city for the weekend. It just sucks, i'm friggen broke and i have $10 to go travel on, wow..thats gonna make it far there willy. Just seems like no matter how much i overwork, or try harder the less i stinkin have at the end of the week.  I suppose i should get off my crapper and do something about it, but right now at the time i feel tired after work, and i think its BS to have to work 2 jobs to have another 40 per week if needed, hell maybe i need a roomate, maybe i can find one in the city if i move, till then i'm stuck here in Ada, with like $10 a week to live off of, hardly anything to do, and a suck ass view of life.  The more and more I look into moving, the more inconvient it seems to my so called 'bs contract' with this place, and moving back in with my parents is out, as well as my sister to secure a job in okc. Fark i just feel like im doing this all alone, oh yah i am.  Broke sucks.. i think i'll make some koolaid and hope that someday equality in a roomate will help me out, till then , since i have 3 months left, i might look into options of another job, less time with people, ah love that idea.  More to bitch about later  =WCKED
