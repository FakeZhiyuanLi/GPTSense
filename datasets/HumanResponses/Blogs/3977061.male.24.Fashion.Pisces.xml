      I can't believe the night that I'm having.  First, my ex texts me to tell me how much he loved talking w/ me and how much he misses me and loves me.  Moments later, I'm talking w/ my friend (who also dated this guy in the past), and he tells me that my (our) ex has just asked him what he would do IF he were in love with him!!!!  Can you believe the nerve of some people?!?  For one, he wasn't with my friend for as long as he was with me, and he always said there was a better connection with me than with my friend.  AND!!!  He had NEVER even came close to saying he was IN love with me.  And now, since he's all alone and has too much time on his hands, he's allowed to think he can try to play me from a distance, and to be in love with my friend, too?!?!  I don't think so.  Now, really, what you all must understand is that I'm over this guy.  Yes, I love him.  I will always love him.  But I no longer can imagine myself being with him...no matter how many times he asks me for phone sex or internet sex...I don't do that, and he'll never get that off of me.  I moved past him.  I moved past him with the first person that I dated after him.  Granted, that didn't last very long because of outside factors, but we both knew it wouldn't, and that was part of the romance to it all.  It just pisses me off that he thinks he can do this.  He's not only messing with my emotions, but he's messing with my friends emotions, and possibly any potential mate of his.  That's just not right, and while all this can't be brought out into the open yet...only because my friend asked me to not comment on it yet (and I'm loyal to my friends)...it will not go any further.  People need to learn respect.  If you want me, then tell me you want me and grow a set large enough to be able to handle sitting downn and talking things out.  Otherwise, stop wasting your time trying to do something that has no end in sight.  Where does this think it's going to get him?  Does he think it will stop me from moving on?  Does he think I'll be waiting for him forever?  Well, I've got news for him...I moved on, as I said quite awhile ago.  I've dated other people since him, and IF someone worthy comes along, I'll be more than ready to jump on that path.  And I know some of you may think that I'd not be this upset if I didn't still in some way want him.  But it's not true.  I'm upset because I'm not over the fact that so many men are such assholes.  And this just proves my point.  Grow some balls, guys, and put them to better use than what you normally do.

      Yeah, so I was talking w/ my co-worker M a few days ago, and she said to me "If I had your face, I'd be such a BITCH...I'd make men SUFFER."  LOL  While I took the compliment as it was intended (and also told her that she was crazy for thinking that way lol), I can't quite convince myself that I'm as good looking as she says.  But it's been a pretty good week as far as compliments go.  I've been told that I have the porcelin skin colour that many women would die to have, and that I'm beautiful, and that my voice is very nice.  Not sure how to handle so many compliments coming my way at once...and if they weren't all coming from women, I'd probably be in heaven LOL.  But nope, no gay men are approaching me in the bars telling me anything near any of this...so until the one who's cute and serious about it does, I'm staying single!!  lol    Also, I've decided that I have one song in my mind that will mark when I have exactly the right man in my life.  Now, I can't write it here because then everyone would know it...but when the day comes when a man treats me like that song says...and plays that song for me, then I'll know that something is working right.  It was weird because usually I listen to songs and think about who I'd play them for, but this one, I've ALWAYS wanted the right man to play it for me, and treat me like the lyrics say...so I guess it's been a song that for pretty much all my life has been in the back of my mind, and it suddenly just hit me the other night how much I really want that in my life.    Other than that, things have been going okeh for me.  I came home and passed out the other night.  My friend, Jeffrey, came over last night, and I was so tired that I told him I was going to nap and then we could chat later, but I passed out and never woke up till he was sleeping...so I went back to my bed and then got up at 6 o'clock.  I had homework to do for work, so I cut out my little letter for the window display (which took 1.5 hours to cut, and 2 hours to put on display!!!), and even made breakfast and everything this morning...quite the change from my normal run-out-of-the-house-in-under-twenty-mintutes routine!  But we've been having some pretty good days at work...had one really bad day...but after my boss' husband told my coworker to do positive visualization while meditating at night, we've actually just about doubled every day since we've started...so that's great!  We're thrilled about it!  :-)  But thank god I don't work on commission...who wants that kind of pressure?!!?  I'm happy just making sure people get the right clothing and look good when they leave :-)  That's what it's really all about.    I've also started to become more positive lately.  I got depressed a few days back for awhile, but then I cleaned up my room, and forced myself to realise a few things.  Now I'm better...I mean, hey, I got up at 6am today and made french toast and eggs and had some peaches with it all...so that's much more an improvement in my mental processes already!  Now, if only I could keep up w/ that!!!  :-)    My Slovak learning is going well, also.  I didn't open my book yesterday at all...on purpose...so that when I opened it today, I could see how much I had retained...I'm still on Chapter One, but that's a good thing...I've almost remembered most of that entire Chapter...I'm always too much in a hurry to get through chapters instead of actually learning stuff.  This way feels much better.  I guess you could say I'm always trying to get to the end results without the means ;-)  (I believe the quote goes something to that effect...I'll check it on my next Abfab night ;-))    In any case, that's been my life for the past few days...I'll keep you posted as life continues...probably not every day, or even every other day, but I do want to stay fairly regular on this!!!    *MUAH* *MUAH*  Until Next time....Love, X.G.J.V.

      Well, here I am.  I'm sitting in my room (where I've spent the majority of this day) at 1:16am starting an online journal.  Why I am doing this, I have no idea.  I guess that in the back of my mind, I want people to understand who I am.  I also want people to know the real me.  I've been hiding myself (or rather, my true self) from most of the world for a long time, and this is the only way that I can start to break out of that shell.  There will be nothing censored here.  I'm going to write how I feel and what I feel.  Anyone who dates me can read anything about my life.  Anyone who befriends me can do the same.  I'm emotional at times, I'm an extremist, I'm eccentric...  In any case, you will get to know me through this blog.  You will see my good times and my bad times...you will see my feelings as they are present and as they change.  Not all of this will be pretty, not everything will be amazingly interesting, and not all of this will be ugly.  But it will all be me...that much I promise you...as I said above...judge me as you wish...

      Well, I've finally begun the search for my own apartment (with someone else).  Things with my current room-mate didn't quite work out because of our working schedules and everything else, so I've gone solo.  I went to see a charming little place today...was amazing.  The guy has the apartment fixed up very well, and while the room is small compared to what I've grown used to, I think it would be a very good match for me.  He seems nice, and the apartment has a very good feeling to it.  It feels like back home in a way because it's small, and there is a long sidewalk with a garden and grass to one side...just reminds me of being home a bit.  But, I guess we'll see what happens.  He said that if I don't hear from him by the end of this week, he rented to someone else.  I really hope that isn't the case.  I need a place, and this one just seems to fit so much.  Not sure if I gave the right impression or not, but I hope that I get it.  I really liked the place, and it really felt right.  I don't know...we'll see.  If not, then I have to start doing some searching, or I'm going to be apartmentless.  And I have no idea what I'll do if that happens.  Things could get really scary...

      Since this is my first free-write, I will explain it's purpose and how it is generated.  I sometimes get moments where my mind is working too quickly and too intensly that I simply must write something.  I never know what is going to come out on the paper, nor what sense (if any) the final product will make.  Sometimes they are very short sessions, and sometimes they last quite awhile.  No matter how much sense they seem to make or seem not to make, they are, I believe, the essence of my being.  They are what my mind needed to purge to come back to a state of balance.  Or, if not a state of balance, a heightened sense of myself.  Therefore, to you, I present Free-write number ONE...and since I have another that I'd like to share that I found in my real journal, I will also present to you Free-write number NEGATIVE ONE...  ONE "My mind wonders like a bird who sits on a bush or a tree limb waiting to jump and take that leap yet wondering at the same moment if that will be the last jump...the jump of death.  That is the consciousness that I know...that of the leap of death.  For I fear the idea of becoming completely insane in my own mind, yet the idea stirs something in me.  These branches speak to me...they talk...they conversate to me in languages that no one could ever understand.  Jump they scream out to me...jump to the depths that could kill you and with that air, bring yourself to life.  For I have known greatness in my own mind...for I embody the greatness of my own soul...of that vehicle ever-willing to jump to those depths, to that abyss of madness.  For life has no meaning without the desire for madness and chaos.  To be greater than the whole of ourself is the ultimate achievement of the sul and thus is marked by society as something far outside the realm of normality...a kind of sick fascination of character worship...of worshipping an idol of a god too far in the depths of hell that no light..even the ever-burning fires of Hates...could ever illuminate.  Yet this perverted view of ourselves is what we all long to be...placed strategically outside the norms of society...by our own mind that deceives us...that delights us with thoughts of abnormality.  We need to throw ourselves into that hell...to escape ourselves and free our soul...to become mad...to fly free of that tree"  NEGATIVE ONE "I am a steady stream of consciousness I am a desert of sand...the sand flies around spec by spec fleck by fleck it hits me in the eye...slowly making me blind one by one I become blind as I walk through this steam of consciousness with small little fish swimming around my feet one fish two fish three fish I fell them all as they nibble at my toes and tiny droplets of blood start to fill the water.  Dispersing themselves but they do not scatter they, like my tears are crystalyn...little rubies of blood swimming with the fish...who will catch them?  Who will search for my rubies?  And for what purpose?  Do they want them just to sell?  Will they use them only to gain fortune?  But how much are they really worth?  I know not.  How much am I worth?  I used to know...or did I?  I see him in the distance the poor fisherman trying to make a living for himself.  Trying to live day by day by day by day by catching these carnivorous fish who bite me, make me bleed..I see him, but does he see me?  Will he see me before the sand numbs and kills my vision...will I even know if He sees me?  Is he the one to pan my rubies from the water?  The poor fisherman turned rich by my blood...will he know it's me?  Will he care?  Does he See the pain I go through for him?  Does he care?  Do I care?  My legs no longer exist; they have Been brutally chewed by these fish five fish six fish seven fish eight they all gnaw at my legs...I feel the sand still hitting my eyes my stream of consciousness cannot stop the small bits of sand...I dunk my head to clear my eyes but the fish nine fish ten fish eleven fish twelve they eat my eyes like two hard-boiled eggs covered with specs of salt...they eat my eyes and I cannot see yet my steam continues...my steam begins to overflow casting the fish upon the banks thirteen fish fourteen fish fifteen fish sixteen.  They are cast to the banks...flapping and flounder...ing to the lack of air..their air...I know how they feel I'm sent down to the fisherman by the stream only he's not a fisherman...he's in a suit sitting at a table under an umbrella sipping a cabernet-sauvignon but he sees me...bleeding with no legs and no eyes...I have been transformed for him...he has grown rich off of my demise...he's eating bread and brie sipping sipping sipping his wine the wind carries his crumbs through the air and they hit my body floating on the surface...it wasn't sand it wasn't sand I say I scream I cry I yearn to just die...what type of mirage has been this?  What have I died for?  What has become of me and of him?  Can he see my pain...did he cause my pain?  I cannot see...I yearn to see his face...his expression...his truth...but I cannot...the fish see for me seventeen fish eighteen fish nineteen fish twenty all flapping and suffocating on the banks...he is killing us all...they are suffocating on my air and I on their stream...my stream of consciousness."
