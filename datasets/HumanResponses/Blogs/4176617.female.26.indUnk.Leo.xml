      Ahh, yes, it is another ___________ story!  If you have no idea who ________is, then you must read on to thy previous posts, as I am way too exhausted to explain it all here.  So, today was like any other day, I got to the child's home around 7:30am, _________ was wide awake and perky.  We watched her favorite T.V show, 'The Carol Duval Show' on HGTV.  She loves watching aging women make crafty objects.  She then decided it was a great idea to take a nap in a position that would usually be mistaken for praying to Allah.    When she awoke, she came to bother me and sing a song (that she made up on the spot, mind you!) about a file box.  YES, she sang an entire song about the uses of a file box, how it looks and where you could put it in your home.  She is quite practical.  Then, she decided to cruise the internet and create a wish list for her parents.  Kids these days, whatever happened to good old crumply paper and pencil, complete with scribbles and misspelled words??  __________ does hers on word, it comes already equip with spell check and the use of computer graphics, her list was full of images of all the gadgets she needs from Brookstone.  BROOKSTONE, no dollies for this youngster.  Lunch time finally arrived and making this mid-day meal is no small feat.  Today it was 'Lunchtime with ________' on the food network.  She describes the process in its entirety as if she is on a television show.  We could be making PbJ and you would not be spared the exclamation of how to spread your Pb on both sides of the bread to prevent Jelly leakage!  I haven't figured it out if she thinks I am listening or if she is aware that I am not listening.  I just go on with my preparation as she tells our audience how delicious our tuna salad will be!  Alas, I have one more week of these Strange Days, what on Earth will I blog about then!

      I promised more ____________ stories and here is one that is very amusing!  We were on the bus heading to the mall to get some hot Asian buns, yes that is what the Bao's are called (they are very yummy) and as we were exiting the back door...._____________ went flying out the door and stumbled onto the ground.  I believe she lost her footing and tripped over the curb but she managed to roll over at least once, it was if she had just dived out of the door, I didn't realize the sight of hot Asian buns could promote such a response from a young girl.  It also startled many tourists as they were enjoying the brisk Autumn,oh I mean August day, shopping at the mall.  By the way, she was fine, we both laughed hysterically at the incident and then proceeded to eat our buns blissfully.

      Last night, my friend and I stumbled into what we thought to be a pretty lame excuse to drink on a Monday night.  The bar had a Tiki theme and was filled with suits, enough said...Alas, it was half-price Monday, and you cannot go wrong with $4 mango margaritas and $3 chips and guac...and then there was KARAOKE and the king of all Karaoke DJ's TOBY!  My friend is an advent Karaoke goer and is not shy about dancing all about the stage to the Copa Cobana and Dancing with myself and a quite interesting interpretation of Back in Black, (Bless him) I hadn't been up singing my heart out since I lived in Japan.  I struggled with my first numbers, two dull choices by Fiona Apple and Heather Nova, I picked up the pace with my energetic ballad for girls who need to drink on a Monday night with Cyndi Lauper.  It wasn't until I stunned the crowd, well, a crowd for a Monday, with my surprise ocapella version of Mercedes Benz.  I used to channel Janis every time I held the mike in Japan but it was different when the faces staring at you are smiling because they know the song, not because they have no frigging clue what you are saying!  It was great fun.  It was like they like me, they really like me!  It kicked ass.  Never underestimate the power of the tiki!

      So, here I am at 9pm on a Sunday and I need to get to bed soon!  During the school year I am a elementary school teacher.  Well, I should correct that, I am an assistant teacher at a private Catholic school in downtown Chicago.  That brings some light on the subject doesn't it.  Most of my students are from very wealthy families and Christmas time usually rakes in some nifty gifts.  So, my summmer consists of full time babysitting for one family in particular among other kids.  The girl I am currently watching is a 10 year old girl whose parents are both professionals.  I get paid well and my days are usually filled with museums, zoos, pools, shopping, T.V, reading, knitting (yes, the 10 year old taught me) lunch outing, play dates (that is what they call playing with another child these days) and library trips.  Now, by now you are probably thinking, wow, this girl has got it good.  That is until you have met ______.  It is hard to describe _________.  She is a most interesting child.  Let me start by saying, the child can never be left alone.  I am constantly at this child's side.  When ________ is reading or watching television, I am not far behind.  This has gotten rather tedious.  I often can be seen drifting in and out of delirium.  Every single time, I get up to use the toliet, I am asked where I am going, what am I doing, how can I possibly use the bathroom when I am enjoying the company of ________.  Now, besides the neediness of this child, she is also well, CRAZY!  She has no social skills, being an only child with two very OCD parents.  I am not allowed to lean against the walls (dirt, you know), you must open the fridge carefully (in order not to get fingerprints on the steel), and there is furniture in the home one cannot sit upon (what else would I use a chair for!).  I of-course have learned all this by trial and error.  The child is deathly afraid of pigeons, which makes it difficult to go, absolutely anywhere in Chicago, without her screaming bloody murder at the sight of even the most modest looking pigeon.    ________ is also slightly overweight and I am in charge of making sure she is active.  I frequent the local gym and would like to think that I am in decent shape, but I am afraid that this summer has been a lot of ass sitting.  I made the mistake of informing her that we were going for a bike ride and suddenly, my god, she twisted her ankle!  Yet, we are going out for ice cream, my god, she is STARVING.  So, of-course her weight is my fault, as her mother questions our activity schedule.    I can continue with my __________ stories and I will make sure to post them as they arise.  I only have 2 more weeks to go and then I am off to LA to visit my boyfriend and then Graduate school awaits me this fall.  I will miss the city and the Christmas presents from my past job but I will not miss the summer of the brat.
