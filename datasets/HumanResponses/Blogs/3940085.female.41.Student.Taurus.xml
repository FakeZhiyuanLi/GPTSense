      &nbsp;&nbsp; I heard on the radio this morning that Saddam Hussein had a stroke. They are giving him a brain scan to see how bad it was and according to his lawyer he must have medical care and they say his health is so bad he might not make it to trial. Ok are we suppose to feel sorry for the sick bastard? I by nature am not a mean woman but I say let him suffer like he made everyone else suffer!  &nbsp;&nbsp; The guy is evil down to the core and when he became president he had people killed that he felt had to much power and posed a threat to him. He had the men in a room for a meeting and than he began to call names of men&nbsp;and they&nbsp;were taken out and shot. Some were tortured and set free to show an example.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its unbelievable all the bodies of men, women and children they dug up that he had&nbsp;killed. The man and his two sons got off by torturing people and when the list became shorter they would than begin on the persons they had considered friends. In the gulf war he refused to feed his troops saying that God, can't think of what they call their God, would provide for them. I can remember his troops surrendering to Americans just to get something to eat and drink.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about all those people he has gassed, shot and beheaded ? I mean this guy is so cold that one of his daughters and her husband had to leave their home because there was a death threat against him. Saddam than said that the two were forgiven and that they could now come home. The woman's husband set one foot across the border and he was shot.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Hussein had a stroke. I hope God does not shoot me down when I say good because he is now getting his own! I say we let the guy rot and just forget the trial and execute the looser.    SUPPORT OUR TROOPS!!!!!!!!!!!! Lets pray that Bin Ladden is next!

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any friends that you consider to be so stupid that you can't help but wander why your friends with them in the first place? I have a male friend that I will call John. John has been divorced three times and has two kids ages 10 and 8 that he has full custody of. The man is 47 years old and the most boring person I know. John was complaining that he has no where to meet women and refuses to go to bars and night clubs because he says he can't stand the smoke and how he smells after. He is a nonsmoker. Ok he is telling me about these women he wants to ask out. One works at a gas station he goes to and another one is at this coffee spot. I always tell him to ask the women out and take them to a movie or something. He says that isn't good because you can't talk. I said that it is good to be in public and after the movie you could go for coffee and talk than. He says he wants to invite the woman to his house for supper. Ok I tell him that no woman in their right mind is going to go over to his house because they don't know him from Adam. I started to get a little sick of his pissing and moaning and told him that most women would&nbsp;that to be really boring. The man is boring!!!   &nbsp; I have this friend named Tonya and John keeps asking me to set him and her up. Mind you she is 27 and he is 47 with gray hair and big glasses. He told me that he thinks she is fine and he wants to get a piece of ass. All he wants to do is screw her. I have to laugh because why the hell would I set him up with my friend knowing he just wants sex. He thinks he can get her into bed and likes to inform me that he can give woman 3 to 5 orgasms&nbsp;and goes into the details. Like I really want to hear how he goes down on someone. I'm like mister you must be doing something wrong to have been married three times and the longest lasted only 5 years.   &nbsp; John also thinks that he is the worlds greatest father. His house is a mess and he went crazy charging up computers and stuff on his credit card. He said he was going to claim bankruptcy three years ago. Any way he thinks he is the father of the year and I tell ya I just don't see it. John tells his kids to much about his personal problems with his last ex-wife. He is in a custody battle because he wants to move out of the state and he will talk about his ex and the crap going on in front of them and makes her look like a monster. I feel he lives through his kids and treats them more like mini adults and that's just wrong. I firmly believe that if he is having problems with her the kids don't need to know. I have called over to his house like about 9 o'clock and he will just be feeding his kids supper. The man gets off work at five o'clock. Am I like a moron here but my kids are already in bed by that time. He has called me during the week and it would be around 9:30 or 10 and he will be yelling for his kids to hurry up and get into the shower.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I am just a bitch but I think the guy is a fruit cake and he thinks he is all that and a bag of chips. I DON'T THINK SO!!!!

      &nbsp; God......What a concept. Something all knowing, has always been there, and is love. I believe in God but I don't believe in religion. People wander how&nbsp;I can believe in God but not believe in religion. They are not the same. Religion is organized and there are rules handed down that says you have to do this or that in order to get God's love. I am a recovering catholic myself. They say they are the true church and God says they are. Yea right!!! Do I sound bitter when it comes to the catholic church? I do not believe in the idea of having to go to church to be near God and to win his favor. I am a firm believer that all things have energy and if I want to be close to God I can do it walking near a pond or sitting on my bed.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I guess after all the crap going on with priests I can't help but wander if God is cleaning up their mess. To claim they are holy and&nbsp; hide all the sexual garbage under the rug. The church must do what ever it can to maintain its power over its people. They say that God said the priests should not married. All this was written by a man that had lovers and refused to marry them. The catholic church hates woman.&nbsp; Priests are not allowed to marry because the spouse would obtain&nbsp;his stuff&nbsp;at his&nbsp;death. The church would get nothing and that would piss them off big time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married women in the catholic church are tought that they are to be submissive to their husbands and they are to have sex only&nbsp;to satisfy her husbands need and if you get pregnant that's even better because there is another future Catholic to control. Women are to not enjoy sex.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok here is the part where Catholics go nuts on me. Come closer and Ill tell you. I firmly believe Jesus was married and that his mother had more children. Oh I know you think I am crazy but if you know anything about the Jewish faith you would understand that it was not acceptable for a Jewish man to not be married at age 30. The catholic church wants others to believe that he was never married and that Mary remained a virgin all her life. Give me a break. No woman could be mans property back then and not give her husband sex. Even in&nbsp;the writings of Jesus he refers to his brother and sister. Is this writing going any where? Probably not.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I believe in God. I believe in Jesus. I believe in angels. I do not believe in religion!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp; Hey, ever feel like your alone in a crowded room? Feel like you stick out&nbsp;in a crowd? Well that's my feelings in a nut shell. I was raised the only girl in my family with three older brothers and spent most of my time alone. I did not share many of my thoughts with people because They just couldn't or wouldn't understand. I am a strong believer in angels and spirit guides leaving me as the "Freak" of my friends and family. I am also a Buffy The Vampire Slayer fan but I also consider Charmed and Tru Calling amongst my viewing pleasures.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I am a true horror fan with a soft spot for vampires and zombies. I find them to possess the dark parts of our human condition. The vampire needs blood to stay alive and represents sucking the life out of you. Who do you suck the life out of? Zombies&nbsp;eat human flesh and live on a basic animal drive of survival. Humans eat, breath, and sleep and we believe that this is our birth right. hell...you either understand or you don't.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a full time student and working for a BA in Criminal Justice. My favorit class was forensics and having to guess how long bodies have been dead. We studied like bullet holes, hangings, self inflicked gun shot wounds and stuff like that. Morbid yes....but it was really interesting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok enough for now because I know you want to run and pretend you never read this. WHATEVER!

      Do you hate house flies!? It is housefly season and I hate flies. They say that the fly is a symbol of evil but I call it a symbol of something is rotten somewhere. They say that a fly doesn't eat solid stuff it sucks the moisture out. I am not and will not give examples.  At my house I have become the fly swatter. I spend hours killing flies and get my arm work out. Did you notice that a fly will always land on something fragile when you are trying to kill it. Its like they are thinking Oh land on the china and she wont kill me. I can see it laughing at me and that's not good. I tell the fly not to mess with me and swing softly. Heheh gotcha. I walk away smiling from my new conquest. I am Jody the fly swatter (ok ya its suppose to be funny and taken from the vampire slayer).  I mostly hate flies when I am eating. A fly lands on your porkchop and all you can picture is this fly playing in your cats litterbox and now he is on your food. EEEEEWWWWW!!!! My ex-husband has a cousin that owns a farm. They have pigs and cows and they would invite you to like graduations and you would have to eat outside. I never ate because I was so grossed out. People would be shooshing flies off their plates like it was nothing but how many piles of cow crape did this fly stand on. God the thought makes me want to hurl. My ex would ask me why I wasn't eating and I would say I was waiting for everyone to get done and I wasn't all that hunger. He says this as he bites into a chicken leg that he just chased a fly off of.  I am not talking a few flies at this farm. It was so bad that you had to roll up your windows in your car so it did not fill with flies. I swear your car would look like the room with flies in that movie Amityville horror if you did leave your windows open. Does the visualization  alone do yah in. Little Harry is eating a browning and says he likes them with raisins in it. Guess what that was not a raisin buddy. You do all you can not to hurl all over from the thought. Well tune in next time folks because we will talk about the loved mosquito. HEHE can never tell.

      What is your first thought when you see tattoos? What about bodypiercing? I think the first thought is the person is a freak, a biker, a biker chick, drug addict, devil worshipper, and I could really go on forever.  I am addicted to tattoos and body piercing. I love the thought of putting art on the body and have done so many times. I have a tiger cub on my left leg and a cat face on my right. Both my upper arms are tattooed also. On my left arm I have a wolf man and I LOVE this one best. On my right arm I have a dream catcher with bear tracks around it. Shirts with sleeves usually cover these up. On my right forearm I have a unicorn that is 9 years old and it looks great.  At this time I do have some piercing but I don't count my ear lobes. I had my nose done first about 4 years ago. I am a ring wearer because the swirls usually fall out because my nose is so small. A month ago I got my navel pierced. I was surprised at how little pain there was. I would have to compare it to a pinch. Nobody ever sees it but I do and I love it.  Last night I got my brow pierced. I noticed that most people do their brows vertical and have a ring. The ring hangs out and I think it is ugly. Mine is horizontal and with a barbell. I was expecting pain and bleeding but again it was a pinch and I did now bleed. My piercings were done by professional piercers. AVOID THE GUN because it was made only for ear lobes. If a place does body piercing with a gun run the other way  When I do wear sleevless shirts I get looked at and I have seen people walk away from me. I think those who judge others are really trying to make themselves feel better. I am not a bad person. I am 41 years old, have two children, Am a full time university Student with a B honor roll getting a BA in criminal justice and I want to be a probation officer working with teens. What people think of my tattoos and piercing bothered me at one time but not anymore. I feel good about my body and this is how I decorate it for myself. My kids love it and their friends love to come over and I have heard them ask how my son got such a cool Mom.
