      Hmmm... a while since i updated this blog. So here i am, providing you on the latest update. Haha  Last week was a mess. I can't remember what happened for the week. I know i went to school, came back home, take a nap, do homework and sleep. Boring ya? This is my life. Haha.  The earlier part of last week was boring. So boring i almost bored to death. Haha. But on thursday, it was a day i would never forget. When i reached school that day, i was shocked. My class was missing by more than half! Only 8 people, including me, turned up. It turned out that the others had went on a "class outing" to Jurong East Entertainment Centre. Well, it was actually not something new, considering that there was once where 13 people skip school to go to some Polytechnic Open House. Anyway, I remember the school was speculating that the "O" level results would be released on Friday(20th Feb). So in view of this, the class chairman suggested going out to play so as to enjoy the last bit of "freedom" we had, of course at the expense of school. Most went and had fun, with the exception of 8 poor souls who has integrity and insisted on coming to school. But it turned out the school was wrong and the results are not even released yet up till now. So they face some disciplinary problems which i shall not elaborate here. Haha. School on that day was rather slack. Come on, the teacher see our class size and he lost all mood to teach. Lolz. After school, i went to meet up with one of my secondary school friend and we went to city area to walk walk look look. Haha. It was rather rewarding as i finally lay my hands on the game i was looking badly for. Finally, it has returned to me! Wahahaha...oops...sorry. Hmmm...what a interesting thursday.  Friday...the starting of slacking! Haha. Chemistry Practical lesson was one boring lesson, doing titration again. Haiz! Titration for three consecutive weeks? I am so sick of it now. However, after the school break the school decided to let us have a taste of Orientation days again. Hooray! No lessons! Not only that, i also get to meet up with friends in my Orientation Group and Family. F4 ROX! Haha. We had some interaction, OG and Family time, a buffet lunch courtesy of the school and not forgetting mass dances! Haha. Everyone had great fun and it was a emotional moment when everything has ended and everyone has to part. After all, all good things has to come to a end. Everyone just could not forgot the friendship forged during Orientation days and i am sure it wil last on and on. But look on the bright side! We will have plenty of chances to see each other again, be it in school or anywhere in Singapore. At least this is what I told myself. Haha. 5.30 pm and i was back in school. No it is not that i miss the school so much that i can't bear to leave. I was back to attend the Drama Festival. It is a competition among the classes of the Arts Stream. The various classes would adapt or create plays and compete for a place in the Drama Festival. The top four would than present their plays to the audience and judges of the Drama Festival. Prizes include Best Actor, Best Actress, Best adaption etc. All the plays are simply wonderful (but out of the four, there is one which i am still pondering over as i could not understand the message it was trying to deliver) and i guess it must have been hard on the judges to choose. Overall, it was a very new and enriching experience and the plays were simply splendid. Cheers to the performancers! Next activity of the day was a home visit. Well, due to the Drama Festival, i arrived late. Hmmm... this home visit was a bit special. Instead of us ICs trying to get the person to speak, he just open up to us. A very good sign and of course the home visit was rather successful, fulfilling the 70% listen and 30% talk that a IC should observe when conducting a home visit as said by Reverend. Haha. The second home visit of the year i attended and things are improving. Hope this carry on till the end of the year. Hopefully, 2004 will be a year where every home visit is a successful one.  Okay, with this I conclude what I have to say about last week. Do check back often for updates. Lolz.

      Hiz... Hmmm...under the influence of my "brother", i decided to try this thing out. Haha. It look quite interesting and at the same time appealing to me. Hmmm...first post...what should i say? Ar! A review of the last weekend! Haha  Friday...a day where most people take it as the start of a weekend and a day for some fun. For students like me, it is time to slack! Haha. After such a tiring week, a break is just what we need, even though it is for two and a half day. For me, it was just another ordianry friday. Morning lessons, afternoon CCA, well, just another day in my life. But in the evening, i went for the first home visit on 2004. It was a rather good one and i felt happy. This signify a good kickstart to 2004 and i am sure future homevisits will be better! Haha.  Saturday...aargh! I slept at 2 in the morning and i have to get up at 6.30 to go to school. Four hours plus of sleep only and i hate it. Sleeping is my passion and i hate it most when things disrupt it. But in this case, i rather play safe than risk being punished. Haha. On the bright side, the school was having a fun fair called "Love Fiesta" on Valentine Day(Saturday was Feb 14). It was a rather successful one as many people turned up for it. Most stalls managed to sell away all their stocks and one stall even wind up way before the closing time of 5pm. Lolz. There were also performances by students and none failed to amaze and entertain the audience. What a show! How i wish i could be involved but who would ask a bore like me? Haha. I also get to meet up friends from my primary and secondary school. We had fun and seeing them again make me feel so happy as i am scared i would not see them again. Choy! Haha. In a way, it was successful in more ways than one. On the dark side, it was also the JJC annual road run. Oh come on... cross country on Valentine Day? The school has nothing better to do. Haha. Oops. Hehe. The run was fine, the weather was kind too. But imagine missing out the top 100 by just a few minutes? Not only that, i had to drag my exhausted legs around the fun fair which was so crowded that you can't seem to move around without knocking into somebody. Haiz. My legs was screaming at me and i was so relieved when i finally found a place to sit down. Since when did the seats in the school become so little? Haha. But the day does not end here. After taking a well-deserved short break in the comforts of my house, i rush down to West Coast to meet my bunch of friends, not after taking the correct bus but going in the wrong direction. Haha. We had some fun, some talks and well...some things which i rather forget it. Of course not forgetting some "special" moments. Overall, it was a fulfilling day and since when is my bed so comfortable?  Sunday...a day i dreaded most. It signify the end of the slacking period i enjoy every week. Haiz. Than looking at the pile of homework makes me feel even more sad. I woke up at around 1 in the afternoon. Haha. You must be thinking that i am a pig right? Well...you cant blame me, i LOVE sleeping. Than before i can get my mind to do that pile of homework, my mind seems to have been enchanted by my lunch. It tells me to go and sleep and homework can wait. Wa! Sleep again? Yes and i found myself awake two hours later. Haha. Than the tv showed the trailer for the movie 'Moulin Rogue' and i found myself glued to to the tv. After that, the lure of the computer is so great that once again i gave up my homework. Haiz. In the end, i went to sleep without doing my homework. Although i was feeling a bit uneasy but hey, who cares? There is always tomorrow to do my homework. Haha  That should be all for last weekend. Sorry to bored you, readers. But this goes to show how boring my life is, right? Haha.

      Haiz. Sigh. She didn't make it. My friend's mum didn't make it. On 18 April 2003, she left the world, survived by her husband and her two beloved sons. I just could not believe it. In the wee hours of the 18th, here i was at the hospital with my friend taking care of her. But a few hours later, she was gone. I was stunned and shocked. i don't believe it. In the morning i was looking at her making her last struggle. The next thing i knew i was at her wake looking at her through the barrier of the coffin. Everything just happen so fast, so sudden. It make me realise that life is so frail. Hence we should cherish and appreciate every moment of our life. We should make fully use of it. After all, life is short and frail. Whenever you want to do something new, just do it! You never know when you can do it again.  Talking about something new, i am very happy that i have give in my best at attempting something new. Going to a Junior College is a total new experience for me. Not only can i make new friends, but i can also enjoy myself at the orienatation. Orientation is simply one word. Fun. If you carry that "Be Enthusiastic" attitude, no matter how lousy the orientation program is, you will still have fun. If you carry that shy shy attitude, no mater how interesting the orientation program is, you will still find it bored. So the golden rule in enjoying your orientation is to put down your pride, be enthusiastic and tell yourself to try out everything at the program and never be afraid to do things which you think will lose face. If you can do that, i am sure you will enjoy your orientation very very much. So much that you wish to do it again.

      Been a long while since i updated the blog, partly due to the fact i am busy and worried and feeling low about my friend's mother condition.  My friend had told me about his mother's condition a long time ago. But it was nothing serious at that time and all i do was chant for her speedy recovery and talk to him more. Recently, suddenly, the condition just got serious and she only has less than one month to live. I was stunned when i heard this. I mean it was not long ago that she is still okay, but now she is putting on perhaps the last fight of her life. The night when i received the news, I find it hard to sleep. I was worried, but I don't know what I can do. The next few days I was feeling down. So I chanted to the Gohonzon for her and hope that she can win this fight. Now we can only wait, chant, wait, chant...  On a brighter note, I realised the "real" state of happiness. It is when you are truly enjoying yourself doing some things even though it may be stupid and there are many stares on you. A state where you are really happy and ignorant of other people's views on your actions. I realised this yesterday when I was with my bunch of friends. We were walking to the MRT station after a meeting. All of us were doing some dances as we walked and it was full of laughter as we laughed at ourselves. At a traffic junction, two of my friends went on to cross the road, leaving us behind. When they realised they have lost us, they waited at the opposite end. As they waited, they began to dance again, in front of everybody at the junction! We laughed like mad when we saw it and simply can't stand it. Of course, we do feel some embarrassment for them. But what strike me was that they enjoyed what they were doing, totally ignorant of the public stares they received. This make me realise that we are simply too concerned about how people view us that we sometimes live for the sake of looking good to others, even if it means we have to suffer below our appearances. Thus I admire people who dare to stand out and portray their true self. Will I ever be like them? I don't know...

      Hmmm... a while since i updated. Haha  Recently. I went and check out my senior blog. Wow! It is wonderful and totally different from my boring blog. I don't know how to describle it but it definitely is better than my blog. Just imagine, it even has pictures of him and his girlfriend. Haiz.  Enough about this. Last friday(27 Feb, i will never forget this day) was D-day for me. It was the release of the "O" Level results! Aargh! But, surprisingly, i was not nervous over it. I didn't lose sleep nor my appetite over it. In fact, for the past week, i slept so well that no one notice anything amiss. Haha. I told myself that everything has been fixed and it is no use bothering over it. The Cambridge markers has marked and graded my papers. The results has been moderated and i can't do anything to alter it. So why bother over it? Just accept it and see where can i go from there.  I only feel a bit nervous as the the time approached. Two hours before i received my results and i am starting to feel anxious. Oh come on, i am a human after all and it is natural for me to feel anxious right? I am particularly concerned about my Additional Mathematics grade. I remember i screwed up the paper and lose roughly 60%-70% of the marks according to my caculations. What make me feel more worse was that my friend keep on reminding me on the marks i lost. Aargh! I just hope i can get a C6...  Surprise, surprise! When i got my results, i was shocked. I didn't get a C6 for my Additional Mathematics but rather a B4! I was so happy that i was at a loss for words. Furthermore, i was ranked 2nd in the whole cohort. By the way, my school cohort for 4E was only 27 for 2003 "O" Level. Haha. But the results really shocked me. I expected lousier results. This is definitely a great benefit that Gohonzon has given me and i am very grateful for that. For that, i decided to serve Gohonzon even more diligently.  To those who have not done so well, take it easy. Look out for the courses available to you and pick one which you feel will serve you well in your career. I believe you can excel later on in life and don't let the "O" results affect you. After all, what employers look at is firstly your character and secondly your Diploma or Degree and hardly at your "O" results. All the best to everyone!

      Wow! A long time since i blogged. Does anyone out there miss me?  Anyway, been busy and stressed up by studies. Haiz. JC life is not as simple as it seems. Everyday, you go to school, you sit down in lecture theatres which is either too cold or too stuffy and listen to BORING lectures. Furthermore, the teacher is like rushing for something, talking fast and furious and trying to cram lots of new and hard informations down your throats. Than, after that, you travel from one lecture theatre to another, to another and yet another. Boy i feel like i am on a campus tour everyday! Haiz. Still got one and a half years to go. Why does time passed so slowly when you are suffering and so quickly when you are enjoying?  One more bad thing about JC is the homework! They are horrible. So hard and so many yet you have so little time to do it. This is torture! Why must MOE squeeze so many things into a time frame of less than two years and hence producing so many nerds? It seems like what they are doing(producing nerds) is a sharp constrast to what the Singapore government is doing(promoting Singapore as a vibrant country). How to be vibrant when they are so many nerds around?  Anyway, enough of my complaints. Got to go and do my homework. Haiz.

      Today is the 18th! Tomorrow night, i am flying off to Japan! Not for vacation though. It is with my religion friends and all of us are around the same age. Can't wait for it. Haha. Being in a foreign country with my friends. Sleeping together, eating together, bathing together, chanting together. Can't imagine the joy and fun the trip will bring. But we must be serious though. We are going to visit the base of our religion, Taisekiji. But as youths, how can we let slip the chance to have fun? Especially when you are in Japan? Haha.   HOWEVER, i have got a big disaster in front of me. Tomorrow i am flying off. When i return, i have only two days of rest before the school start again. Guess what, i have one BIG stack of homework left undone. Aargh! Don't know the teachers will kill me or not, since i have not touched a large part of it. Can only pray for my safety and pray that i can make it out the school alive. JC sucks.  Went to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not a bad show. 3 and a 1/2 out of 5. This is one of the worst compared to the 1st and 2nd movie of the Harry Potter series. Why? The show is too summarised. Quite a large part of the story was left out. The movie is simply a summarised version of the story. Those who have watched the 3rd movie and read the book before should know what i mean. The 3rd book is the most interesting of the 5 books. So high expectations are pinned on the movie. However, the movie failed all my expectations, totally. In the story, a lot of interesting and brand new things are introduced and they firmly gripped the imaginations of many readers. But the movie just simply BRIEFLY introduced them. The Knight Bus, for example, take up one chapter in the book. However, the knight bus make an appearance of less than 5 minutes in the show. What really sadden me was the fact that the director left out the whole Quidditch competition. This year, Gryffindor won the Qudditch Cup. But the movie didn't even show it! The part where Harry thinks that Black is out to kill him till where he get to know that Black is his godfather and Peter Pettigrew is the real traitor is so summarised that it is unbelievable. Since when do you help a person that you think is out to kill you to stun a teacher using magic who may save you? In the story, the fact that Black is Harry's godfather was slowly revealed to Harry. But the director does it in one scene. Futhermore, the wonderful past of James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew was left out. The never known past of Snape with the four was also left out. Lastly is the origins of the Marauder's Map. People who never read the book but saw the movie will never know that the Map was invented by the four. Doesn't anyone realised something is amiss when Snape can't figure out the secret of the Map while Lupin can in the movie? After all, Harry never told anyone how to activate the Map the correct way, not even Lupin...   I am too disgusted to go on. Luckily, the 4th movie is directly by another director. But one thing give me some pleasure. Emma Watson or Hermione Granger. She sure has matured in all ways. Wow, she has become more beautiful and her dressing is now more fashion conscious. Look at what she wear during the first screening at London! Her looks really enchanted me...hee hee. She not only grown physically but mentally. During press conferences, questions posed to her was answered very carefully and well, like those Hollywood artists. One day, if she venture into show business, she is sure to be a megastar, like Julia Roberts.
