						   So on Wednesday, I went out to find a pair of platform shoes. It seemed like a good idea at the time... D is REALLY tall... in the 6'6" range, and it would make my life a little easier if I had shoes that made me taller.   Well, S went balistic. Apparently, the whole buying something specific for D wasn't going over too well. We had a huge fight about it on Thursday, which culminated in him rescinding permission for me to do anything with D.   Which, naturally, didn't go so well with me. I was a little unhappy at that thought.  Okay. A lot unhappy.   That doesn't really cover it either.  How about, feeling violently ill from the pain the thought caused? Yeah, thats a little closer.   Which, of course, was the bad thing. I'm not supposed to be this emotionally involved with D. Which is where S gets his problem in the first place. I didn't exactly intend to, but I think there's a good possibility of love developing.   So we fought about it. And discussed it. And Fought about it. And Discussed it.   And I wondered on more than one occassion why on earth I was still with him. I hate being responsible for his uncanny ability to read my thoughts and emotions. Thoughts and Emotions should be private, damn it. And his excessive possessiveness. Why is it such a bad thing if I love another person, so long as it doesn't affect how I feel about him? Can't someone love more than one person?   I knew that I couldn't let this fight ruin the thing I have going with D, because if it did, I'd never get permission from S again. And if that were the case, I knew it would only be a matter of time before I left S for good. I don't want to live my life out with no hope of ever being allowed to have the permission to make choices about my sexual partners.   My ideal situation would be to have S as my lover, spouse, confidant, friend, support and all that, (and providing same to him), without his need for me to be exclusively his. So long as I'm not neglectful in my duties, I shouldn't think he'd have anything to complain about. *sigh*  His gifts do complicate things. Why does he have to be a mind reader? Who's idea of a sick joke was it to lock the two of us together in love?   And make no mistake, I love him deeply. I can't really imagine a life without him in it. But he's so stuffy. And frankly, I grow so tired of being chained to someone so unbending. Not only that, but I wonder sometimes if I'm still in love with him. Or if it's grown in to more of a deep friendship type thing.  I want to re-pierce my nose. I've wanted that since before he and I even got together. He doesn't like nose rings though. So I don't. I want to dye my hair red/auburn. He doesn't like fake red hair. So I don't. He doesn't like platform shoes. (Another part of the reason for going balistic over them... I spent too much money on a pair of shoes he hates) He doesn't like half or better of the type of clothing that I like, he doesn't like my music. I'm starting to wonder what we DO have in common anymore. It just seems like we're drifting apart.   We used to do stuff together. We used to go to the movies together, sing songs together in the car, talk, read novels together, play video games, play cards...   We can't really afford to go to the movies anymore, being poor... And to be quite honest, watching movies at home has kind of lost it's appeal. I'd much rather cuddle and talk quietly together than watch a movie. Watching a movie together doesn't really feel like spending time with each other. It feels more like spending time with the TV.   So we had this fight. And I start seriously considering leaving S. And not from an emotional-I'm-pissed-off-at-you state, but from a I-make-you-miserable-because-of-how-I-am-and-you-aren't-giving-me-what-I-want-out-of-life state.   I don't want to make him miserable.   The next morning, I ask him to reconsider letting me see D. Which brings us back in to the fight. Which he finally ends with a having-to-go-to-work-do-whatever-makes-you-happy guilt trip type thing.   I already had plans to see D for the day. I'd made them earlier that week. I hadn't heard from D in the last couple of days though, so I didn't know what was going on there for sure. I called him, and he was hung over. He'd gone out drinking the night before to celebrate the end of finals.   Feeling more than a little upset over the fight S and I had, I opt for driving over there and surprising him rather than waiting for him to wake up and get showered and drive someplace to meet me, if he even ends up being capable of doing so.   He knew right off that something was bothering me, but I wasn't ready to talk about it at first. He played the piano for me. It was beautiful. Finally, we go back in his room, and cuddle, and of course I start to cry. All I could think about at the moment was how terrible it would be if this were the last time I was able to do this.   He wanted to know what was wrong, naturally. I ask him how he feels about me. There's some discussion over this. But ultimately it's "more than a friend - a lot more" but "unsure if it's love due to a lack of experience in that regard". I know enough about myself to know that I'm not in love with him. Yet. But I'm oh-so-close.   I tell him about what happened with S. He's not real happy with the idea either. We discuss it back and forth.   He's such a good guy.   I'm such a terrible person.   I asked him if, if I were to want to leave S and be with him, would he let me.   He said no. Not under these circumstances.   The more I thought about it, the more convinced I became that I didn't want to be with S anymore. Not that it mattered, atleast as far as D goes, but I was feeling that way. I'm still not sure that I'm wholly where I want to be.   I keep wondering if I'll ever be completely happy with my life again. S used to worry about D. Worry about my being involved with D. Worry about my leaving him for D.   He was probably right to worry.  I get the impression that D would accept me as I am. That he would allow me to express myself and to be the person I am without trying to conform me to his ideals.   Oh, I think that had S just given his permission at the get go, when D and I first started to do stuff... That it would have been different. Rather than hanging out together, talking, being intimate, cuddling, etc... we would have probably just boffed and got it over with. And ended up as friends that boffed occassionally. However, S, in his infinite wisdom, decided to take the course of wait. The course of wait, which forced D & I, with lust raging through our bodies and no way to vent it, but also with a strong desire for each other, to spend that time with each other doing other things aside from getting the sex out of our systems.   So yes, I blame S for the emotional levels that have developed. Perhaps I shouldn't. Perhaps the blame falls squarely on my shoulders. As well some of it should, but I truly believe that things would have been different if it had just happened and been done and over with. (And everyone else I've talked to says the same as well).  So the more I think about it, the more I wonder if I shouldn't just move out.   But now it seems that if I did, if I would, if I could, I would lose not just S, for which I'm prepared for at this point, but D as well, for which I'm not prepared at all.  Oh, and the icing on the cake? Joe, ex-boyfriend who lives out of state, Joe, who has, apparently, never gotten over me and has a picture of me sitting next to his bed, and who has most likely put me upon a pedastle that I'd never be able to maintain should we ever get back together...  Asked me once again to leave S and come to him.   So perhaps going back to my mother wouldn't be my only option. I could run away and go live with Joe. Although I think it would be temporary. I don't think I could make it work with Joe permanently, although it would probably depend entirely on so many variables it's impossible to foresee them all.  It would satisfy a curiousity thought. Settle the question once and for all as to whether or not Joe and I would have worked. Ah well. We shall see what happens.

						   S forgot that J, our daughter, has Violin Lessons this morning before school.   Wonderful.   Which put me a half an hour to an hour behind schedule for getting out of the house in time.  But wait, it gets better.  Y's ex-husband lets us do laundry over at his house, providing we let him know beforehand what day we will be coming over.   Y forgot to call him earlier this week when I said that I would be doing laundry on Wednesday to tell him and make sure that was okay.   So on the plus side, I don't have to try and gather, sort, and pack all the laundry before getting my kid off to school, in addition to being behind schedule.   So as if that weren't bad enough... I told Y earlier this week that I'd be seeing D on Tuesday morning, (Yesterday), and of course, she doesn't remember when I try to talk to her about what we did yesterday.   I swear I might as well not even talk anymore. It's not like anyone listens to me anyways.   What really sucks is that I was in a really good mood last night, due to a fantabulous phone conversation I had with D before coming back from Pagan Meetup, even thought the meetup itself had been kind of lame, until I came home.   *sigh*  I come home to Y and S, cuddled up all over MY side of the bed. WTF? I've been having issues with their whole physical contact thing ever since S told me that he loved Y, too. Coming home to find them all over each other on my side of the bed wasn't conducive to keeping my mood "good".   The meetup. Jeeze. I didn't want to be there. All I could think about was how much I'd rather be with D than hanging out there. My heart wasn't in it. With D leaving to go to his summer internship this summer, I just wanted to spend time with him. Of course, he's got a final today that he had to study for last night, so it wasn't possible. Which would have really bummed me out if it hadn't been for the fantabulous phone conversation.   He said some really nice things. ;-) For starters that I was such a distraction not only when I was around, but even after I left, that he wouldn't be able to concentrate. :-D He said he liked giving me shit for thinking too much about stuff, but when I started to offer not to do that anymore, he fell all over himself telling me that he liked me just the way I was and for me to not do that. ;-) When we talked about how high maintenence I am, he said that it wasn't as if he had to carry the full brunt of maintaining me himself, because Y and S help (a lot, really, for all I bitch about them). I made a comment like, Yeah, you'd probably be like "I can't handle this crazy bitch all by myself!". And then he came off with, "Well, I'd try..."  Which made me feel all warm and fuzzy. Although I hadn't planned on relationship building with my very first foray in to open relationships... To be honest, originally, I figured it'd be best if D and I just fucked, got it out of our systems, and went back to being friends. Friends who sometimes fuck. But S holding off on giving me permission for as long as he did caused things to build a little higher than I think they would have.   It's crazy. But I think I've got atleast one foot in the door of being in love with D. I didn't really want to fall in love with anyone other than S and maybe Y, (still in love with S, for those who are getting confused... ), But it seems more and more that it's inevitable. Unless I decided to stop seeing him altogether, which I'm not willing to do, naturally.   People reading this might be confused. It's kind of like coming in on the middle of a converation... But I think if I tried to put all the back story up first that it would take too long and I'd never get around to venting about my problems/joys.   Oh, and if the timing could be better... S is possibly taking a business trip up to Nevada next week. Which would leave me free and clear to spend a TON of time with D. Of course, Y's kids are leaving next week to go to Oklahoma, so there is a good chance that she will be in a really foul mood because she's going to miss her kids. And of course, I'm not going to be in the greatest of moods due to D's leaving... So it will definitely be an interesting week.   Of course, Y's upset that S won't be here to comfort her. And then she wonders why I get irritated about her lack of being in love with me. How on earth can she fall in love with someone when she focuses all her attention on someone else????  Ack. Time to take the kid to her violin lessons.   Bleh.   Until next time.  Delairen

						   I've heard about the Blog thing. At first it didn't strike me as any big deal. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought that perhaps having a random, safe place to put my thoughts out, and perhaps get some feedback from might not be a bad idea...  Plus I'm just a little bit of an exhibitionist, so this will give me an enviroment in which to expound upon the private details of my life without worrying too much over picky details such as Too Much Information or Offending Close Friends.   I suppose I should describe atleast who I am and what my living situation is. I'm 25. I have a wonderful husband, hereafter known as 'S', who I've been with for nine years. (He's the best!). I have a daughter, hereafter known as 'J', who is eight. I have a Girlfriend, hereafter known as 'Y', who lives with me, as do her two sons, "L" and "A". Yes, it gets to be a little crowded. In addition to these wonderful five people who make up the bulk of my life, I have Lover, hereafter known as 'D'.   Complicated enough for you?   Sometimes it makes my head hurt a little bit, and I'm the one that started it all...  I've never really considered myself monogamous. Oh... There are times when I've tried. Notably for most of the last nine years with my wonderful husband. He, has ALWAYS considered himself monogamous. Talk about marital issues. When you love someone deeply, but can't stand the thought of never, ever, ever sleeping with anyone else, ones only recourse is to cheat, I imagine. I only cheated once, and that was enough. It nearly destroyed our lives together, so I didn't cheat anymore. Over time I managed to wear him down though. Now I have permission to have D as a lover. Eventually I hope to get that expanded to include whatever might be needed, but for now, it's sufficient. More than sufficient really, considering how hard it was for him to give it to me.   Not cheating is hard though. I don't know if I've been cursed with less will power than other people, although it seems that way sometimes. Sometimes I wish I could just be "normal". But I suppose I'll never really be normal. Thanks, S. It's all your fault. ;-)   So I don't know how often I'll get to post on this. LIfe is pretty full when you take care of three kids full time AND try and maintain a house... But I think this would be a good place for me to ramble my thoughts out. Wonder if anyone will read it.   Delairen

						   To try and get back on my diet. I'm thinking I'm going to make the attempt anyways. I'm tired of feeling like crap. ;-)  I spoke with Don last night.   *quiver of happiness*  We talked seriously about moving in together. Something I didn't think we'd be talking about for a long time, should it even come to pass that we would be together.   *doing the happy dance*  Of course, no decisions have been made at this point. We both know the "right" thing is still for me to try and work things out with Shannon.   Even if it's not really what either of us wants.   I miss Don.   I'm torn at times. I want to be with Don, but I see Shannon trying so hard, and I feel guilty for just giving up when he's obviously putting so much effort in to it. If leaving is the path I'm going to choose, I wish I had just left before, when Shannon tried to rape me. It would make things easier, to leave with justified anger. No choice being presented to me is really going to be easy, and either way I go I'm sure I'll have regrets.   Particularly because the choices have narrowed down to, whether I wanted it to be that way or not, a choice between two men who mean a whole lot to me. The man I'm in love with, and the man I've built a life with.   I suppose most women would be happy to have two men in love with her. To them I say, Yeah Right. Because eventually a choice must be made, and someone is going to be hurt.   I don't want to hurt Shannon. In my heart of hearts I know what my choice is. It would take something drastic to change it at this point.

						   Saturday, after I wrote here. Shannon had the bright idea of going to see Harry Potter after Yvette got off work. While we're getting ready to go, Nicole calls. She's (wonder of wonders) going to the ritual and wants to know where it's at, and if I'll be there.   And all of a sudden, the idea of spending the evening on the beach hanging out with friends seems overwhelmingly more fun than going to the movies with Shannon and Yvette.   So I decide that I'm going to swing by and atleast say hello and get some hugs before the movie. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to skip the movie altogether. The idea of spending an evening with people who don't require anything of me was very appealing.   So first we go over to Joe's house to meet up with Yvette, who is over there doing laundry. And I rush her off with me in the truck to head over to the beach real quick. The moment I get in the truck and take off...   It was unreal. I was giddy. I was shaking. I was excited. I can't explain it. It felt so good to be away from Shannon and his... need. I didn't even realize how incredibly stifled I felt until I got away from him for a few minutes. It was like a huge weight was lifted off of me.   I don't even know why it was affecting me so. It should be nice to feel needed. Perhaps it's because I'm not sure I want to be with him anymore.   So I stopped by the ritual and bestowed hugs and hellos and good-byes real quick, leaving a wake of questions in my path, I'm sure. Several of my friends are pretty perceptive. I'm sure they knew that something was wrong.   So we leave, tearing out of there as quickly as we can, and make it to the theater just in time for previews. We settle in an start watching the movie. During the movie, Shannon is sitting in between Yvette and I. He has his hand on my leg. At one point I look over at him and her. She's cuddled up next to him, and he's resting his chin on her head. What was my first thought at that? I wished Don was here so I could do that, too.   The movie was alright. After the movie, Shannon and I had thought about going to see the Chronicles of Riddick, while Yvette and Jessica went home, but I decided I'd rather go back to the beach and see if I could squeeze in a little hang-out time with my friends. So Shannon, Yvette, and Jessica go home, while I go back to the beach.   I get there just in time for them to be packing up. We all adjourn to Denny's and I sit down and have a chat with Judith. She's concerned about me. She asks me what's wrong. I don't give her all the details, but I give her enough. She commisserates with me. She tells me that things get better, and that I should work things out with Shannon.   On the flip side, I talk to Steve some, telling him about what happened this evening when I got away from Shannon for a few minutes... And he tells me that he thinks I should leave. That I'm not doing Shannon any favors by staying if I don't want to be here.   So I'm sitting at the table with Judith and Ryan (among others) and Ryan pulls out his Tarot cards. I ask him if I can do a one-card pull. (Which ends up turning in to a full spread, but who's counting). As usual, the cards came out as inconclusive as to what I should do. The cards said that I had two paths presented to me, and that one was illusion and one was emotions without stability. It was very difficult to determine which path was which. About all I remember for certain was that the path of illusion had bondage in it's past. Which led me to believe that I'm fooling myself if I think I can work things out with Shannon.   Emotion without stability would probably definitely sum up what Don and I would have. I don't want to be in his way, and I know he's got atleast two years left where he's going to be going to school and getting his degree and what not.   I spent some time with Nicole, who came to the ritual, for the first time in months. She told me I looked awful. (Thanks Nicole.) She wanted to know what was wrong. We went back to her house and I told her all of it. I didn't really intend to, but it all just came tumbling out. She didn't really express too much in the way of judgements. She's worried about Shannon and Myself, but other than that she didn't really have too much to say.   After that I went home. I got home about 3:00 a.m. I was in a really good mood. I had this thought of making an attempt to make things better with Shannon, so I went in and woke him up and made him take a shower with me. ;-) Nothing happened sexually, we just showered. After we got out I suggested that we put on the adventures of Link and try and beat it. So we find the nintendo and hook it up and try to get it work... And it won't, naturally. So we hook up the SNES instead and play some Contra. I was getting tired now though... A shower and some food had made me sleepy, so I laid down and asked Shannon to tell me a story.   He can't. *sigh* So I ask him to tell me a true story then. To tell me a memory. A memory about me that made him happy. So then we get in to a fight about memories. He told me that the two that came to mind were our wedding day and the day he proposed. Which are really great memories, no doubt, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. And I told him that. And suddenly I'm belitting the importance of these memories and ... well, it turns in to a big deal.   And I say forget it, I'm too tired to argue about this, and go to bed. Shannon joins me, and we both go to sleep irritated.   The next day, was alright. Shannon and I had sex, and it was ho-hum again. Did absolutely nothing for me. *sigh* And we talked some. I told him that his current lack of both confidence and sense of humor was causing issues with my finding him attractive and wanting to be around him. So he was a little better about that on Sunday. He seemed a little more like himself. I still didn't feel anything for him though. He was easier to be around, but that's about it.   We went out to eat at Brunos. They've gotten super cheap, the bastards. They raised the prices, made their salads smaller, and no longer give out unlimited garlic bread with their meals. Now you only get two per meal. So I don't think we'll be going back there again.   I was annoyed. :-P   There were so many times I wanted to pick up the phone and call Don on Sunday and Saturday. I managed to resist, but it was hard. On Sunday night, I failed. Shannon and Yvette went to bed early, and left me up alone... and I called him.   I miss him so much.   We had a great conversation. It lasted for four hours or so, roughly.   I think we could make it work, Don and I. I think about him, and spending my life with him, and I get all warm and fuzzy.   Anyways, I need to go hop in the shower here very soon. I'm supposed to go over to Mimi's house today, and Shannon's going to be off work like three hours early, and I kind of want to be gone before he gets back.

						   Shannon asked me on Thursday morning if I wanted things to go back to the way they used to be between us, or if I was too infatuated with "this thing with Don".   I hate the way he belittles my feelings about Don. Maybe it makes it easier for him to not take it seriously. But it still bothers me. He says I don't know Don well enough to be in love with him. *rolling eyes* I say he's full of shit.   I don't need to know everything about someone to love them. I'm sure that, given time, I would learn everything I wanted to know. Atleast Don doesn't purposely shut me out. There have been so many times in the past where Shannon has refused to let me in. "You don't need to know" or "It's in the past it doesn't matter".   I bought a pack of cigarettes on Thursday morning. Shannon started off my day with a fight. Beginning with the comment above. He was pushing me to make a decision. Whether I wanted to stay with him or not. I asked him to stop pushing me. He wouldn't let it go. It was the first pack of cigarettes I'd bought in a very long time.   He asked me whether or not I was willing to give up everything I had, everything we had worked for. He doesn't understand that some of the appeal of leaving is the idea of making a fresh start. Of being my own person and free to make my own decisions.   So I go and do my Reiki with Steve. And as I'm driving home, I had this clarity of thought, and a feeling came over me that the first one I talked to, Don or Shannon, would be the one I was supposed to be with. It was the strangest thing. Of course then The really strange thing happened.  Don called. Over an hour before he was supposed to be off work. When I had already resigned myself to the fact that it probably wouldn't be him, he called. I don't know how to describe it. It was like a lock snapping in to place.   Then, of course, I got home and had a huge fight with Shannon. Go fig. After much arguing and fighting and crying and everything, Shannon tells me that he thinks that my talking with Don is preventing me from concentrating on him. He begs me to stay. He begs me to try and work things out. I've seen Shannon cry exactly two times the entire time we've been together. He cried that night. He says that I'm his strength. He says that he feels that he's failed me. That he's a failure.   And all I feel is pity, sorrow, and guilt.   He's so shattered over this. So I agree to try. I agree to stop talking to Don, though it breaks my heart. I agree to do my best to let him court me, and in return to be open to his courting.   We had sex after that. Sex was all it was. I felt nothing. My body responded the way bodies do, but I didn't really enjoy it, and I didn't feel anything, any connection at all.   He told Yvette that he needed her. That she made him feel worthwhile. He said that I don't make him feel worthwhile anymore. He's afraid that he won't be able to win me back. I guess because he doesn't think I need him anymore.   He's right. I mean, once the obvious of financial support is set aside, right now I don't really feel as if I need Shannon at all. There's nothing I really want from him.   He told me that he thought about letting me go stay with my mother for the summer. But he didn't think I'd come back.   I think he's right about that, too.   The thought of losing me really kills him. I hate that I'm hurting him. I don't like hurting anyone, least of all Shannon.   So on Friday night, I had to say good-bye to Don again, only this time without the benefit of being able to talk to him afterwards.   I'd rather have walked through fire.   I heard the breath catch in his throat, and I think he seemed near to tears. I know I cried.   He told me at one point, during the conversation, that he was so tempted just to tell me to come to him.   I wish he had. I wish he would. I wish he'd call and say "Stephanie, I can't live without you, come to me."   I suppose I should be happy that he loves me enough to give me up and try to do the right thing. Because really, giving my marriage one more shot is probably the right thing, even if it doesn't feel like it.   I don't want to be here. I don't want to be with Shannon. It's crystalized over the last twenty-four hours. I want to be in San Francisco. Or, if not in San Francisco, planning a trip there. Planning for my love's return from San Francisco.   There have been several times over the last two days that I've had to repress a flinch when Shannon goes to touch me. Not because I think he's going to hurt me, but because I don't want him to touch me. Because I don't feel like his anymore, and because I don't want to be his anymore.   I don't know how I can make myself want to be his. I don't feel it. I see the despair in his eyes and I ache for him, but I can't seem to bring myself to do anything about it.   We went to the Amvets in Escondido today. As we got off of 15 on to 78, my heart did a little leap. For one wild moment I could almost imagine I was on my way to Don's house.   Almost.   And then reality set back in and I had to fight back tears.   We drove down Lincoln, to Ash, and I couldn't help myself, I gazed down the street that I would have turned to go to his house, and I longed with all my being to be going that way, instead of the other way. The entire drive over to Amvets filled my thoughts with Don. All of Escondido reminds me of Don now. I'm not sure I'll ever want to go to Escondido again now.   Everywhere I looked I saw Don.   I miss him so much. It hurts so much. Kathy gave me a copy of her Disturbed CD, and I heard a song on it, and my first thought was that Don would love it. Disturbed did a version of Shout, let it all out. It's awesome.  And then I remembered that I wasn't going to be able to share it with him.   The weather outside is dreary. Clouds and misting and cool. It suits my mood.   Everything I see is gray.   I had planned to reclaim my life on friday. Planned to get back on my diet and be done with the junk food. Giving up Don quite undid me though. I wonder when I will ever be able to get back on track. Misery is hard enough with out the comfort of food.   Not that food is much comfort right now anyways. Everything I eat upsets my stomach. Even when I don't eat, it upsets my stomach. So I might as well eat those things that I like the taste of.   I told myself that after the Reiki healing I wouldn't smoke anymore, and so far so good, insofar as that goes. So atleast I'm keeping one promise made to myself. *sigh*  I know that Don is worried about me. He read this blog, and saw the part about suicide. I'd be lying if I didn't admit it still has it's attraction. I promised him that I'd call him before I let it become a real possibility though.   I hate what I've done to my life. If I wasn't completely happy before, atleast I didn't know it.   I hope he continues to read my blog. If I can't hear from him, atleast I can, in some small way, share this part of me with him. The secret parts of my soul that whisper in the darkness. The thoughts that rage below the surface. And if he chooses not to, then I still have the outlet to express myself, and without knowing for sure, I can hope that he reads this. That he sees this. That he knows that I miss him, that I love him, and that I'm trying to do my best for him. Since this is what he wants for me.

						   Sorrow etches the line of her face Sorrow moves her hand with grace Sorrow drives her heart to bleed Sorrow sends her mind to grieve  Sorrow fills her mouth with ash Sorrow tells her nothings left Sorrow lends an ear to cry Sorrow brings her to her knees  She cries She hides She tries She lies  Sorrow makes her want to die Sorrow kills the joy inside Sorrow sends the heart astray Sorrow breaks the mind away  Hand and heart Mind and Soul Lost within A blackened soul  Hold the love against her breast Try to discard all the rest Look to future healing done Try your best not to run

						   When the night has fallen When the day is done When the moon comes out When the stars are bright  She walks away His heart in her hand She walks away Dripping blood in the sand  The waves crash down The brine weaves the air Still the night Takes all her cares  She knows that it will hurt him She knows that he still cares She knows that when she leaves him His heart will be bared  He gave it to her freely And still she walks away Content in the knoweledge That it must be this way  So though it will hurt him Though it will be his death She cannot stay any longer She cannot be his leash  What comes for him now Only he can say For the time has come The end is near  And She is walking away

						   Never Again to feel your touch Never Again to hear your laugh Never Again to lay beside you Never Again to hold your hand  Pull my heart from my breast Feel it beat within your hand Take it with you always And hold it again and again  Flay my skin and burn my soul Take my head, my hand, my heart Pull them through the trials Pull them back to you  You held my hand and kissed my lips You tore me open and built me up Feeling every inch of you inside Gasping beneath you crying in joy  When the ash has cleared When the blows have stopped When the night is over How will things work out  You stood there in the street My heart still in your hand And while you watched You made me leave  The hardest thing I ever did Was drive away that morning Amazing I was able to at all With my heart within your hand  I see your face emblazoned Forever on my mirror The sorrow on your face Watching as I go  It hurts so bad I want to die Hurts enough I always cry The pain fills my life Leaving room for nothing else  I say good bye one last time Goodbye to the heart within your hand I say good bye although I want you I say good bye even though you care  Split me in two and take the best For I shall never rest I'll take the memories to my death And wonder what might have been   I'm going back to him To try and give him this This thing I took from him And left within your hand

						   Shannon says I was irritable today. Perhaps I was. I don't know. Perhaps He was being irritating. I know I was tired, so maybe I was snappish.  I've been tired all day, or atleast, since just before having lunch with my mother. Lunch helped with the headache I had though. I think I'm just not eating enough or something. I've been getting a headache just about every day. Of course, I'm planning on trying to get some semblence of order back to my eating habits starting tomorrow, after Steve does Reiki on me.   I had three cigarettes today. Chalk that up to eight for this week. Considering the week is only half over, I suppose it could be worse. So far, I haven't ~bought~ a pack. Shannon didn't comment on my smelling like cigarettes. I s'pose that's a good thing.   Shannon came up behind me today while I was doing dishes and started kissing on my neck and such. *sigh* It didn't really do anything for me for the most part. There was a moment where I almost felt close to him, but then it was gone. I turned around and we chit-chatted a little bit. He reached up to grab my throat to pull me in for a kiss and I pulled his hand away and told him I didn't like it when he grabbed my throat.   It surprised him. I always used to like it. He asked "since when?"  "Since Thursday"  I think it hurt him, just a little, for me to tell him that. But it was true. I don't want him to grab my throat anymore.   Later, he came over to kiss me as I was sitting at the computer. Grabbed my hair to pull my head back, and slowly let go of my hair to put his hand on the seat behind me instead. *sigh* Things are so broken.   I take a break from cleaning and come to the computer and turn on SL. Don's online. Woo Hoo. I start chatting with Don, enjoying the few minutes I can chat with him...  And Shannon comes off with "I've spent all evening with you and I've barely gotten a smile out of you, and you get online and start chatting with Don and suddenly you are full of laughter and smiles."   *sigh*  My mother thinks I should try and work this out. I mean, when she expresses an opinion at all, that is. She's on this whole "I'm not going to give my advice to anyone" thing going on right now, but she expressed an opinion eventually.   I am trying. I just don't feel it. I don't know what to do. I know Don wants me to try and work it out, Yvette wants me to try and work it out, my mother wants me to try and work it out, and if Jessica was old enough to weigh in with an opinion, I'm sure that she would want me to try and work it out, too.   I feel so broken.   Anyhow. I've decided I'm going to try and get a job. Of course, Shannon was his usual supportive self when I told him.

						   Here is a sampling of my Random thoughts and feelings of the past few weeks. I'm far too distraught to put them down coherently. I expect them to jump around quite a bit. If you don't like it, go read someone elses blog, damn it.  I hate Don.   I love Don.   My heart breaks at the thought of never being with him again.   To save my marraige, I must give him up.   I no longer know if I want to save my marraige.   I no longer know if I'm in love with Shannon.   I know only that I'm unhappy. That I'm sick with love and desire for Don, and that no cure is forthcoming. Particularly in light of the tidbits I scraped from Don last night.   Love. He says he loves me. He said he loved me Saturday night. Our last night together. He cried and held me and admitted what I was pretty sure I already knew.  And yet...  When I asked him what he wanted...  When i asked him to be selfish for just a moment. The truth was, he doesn't want the responsibility that a committment would require. Not that I don't understand that, with him still in school and all...  But it still hurt.   I wish I could throw everything to the winds and Just run away.   We talked yesterday. We talked about San Francisco. He was so excited. So happy. So ...   I wish I could have been there to share it with him. I could only listen to the happiness in his voice and wish I was there.   I wish I was as free as he is.   I sat there and was listening to him, and part of me was so happy for him it could have burst.  And part of me was so afraid that he would love it there and stay there, or find someone else, or whatever.   And then of course, I would stop and realize that I have absolutely no right to not want him to find someone else. I mean, I don't, because I want to be with him, but I do because I want despreately for him to be happy.   Even if it's not with me.  I hate this. I can't think of anything else hardly. He fills my thoughts. My body aches for him, my heart yearns for him.  It hurts so much.   I feel so conflicted. I look at Shannon and I see history stretching out before me. I feel the comfortable weight of expectations known and former happiness. But I don't feel that fire. That burning desire that I used to feel.   What if Shannon's right? What if I can only be in love with one person at a time?  What if it's too late for Shannon? I feel almost no attraction to him beyond the comfort of the known.   Is that terrible?  Shannon told me last night that he missed me. That he missed my smile, my laugh, the love I had for him. When he talks to me that way, I almost miss it myself.   Almost.   The part that doesn't want to have the responsibility of being the other half of his soul cringes away though. The part that wants to be free. To be my own person. To love, live, dance, and do whatever I wish without having to please anyone I don't choose to.   I wonder if I want to go back to the way things were. I wonder if I wasn't so much happy as comfortably manipulated to be so.   I see him doing it now. He said such horrible things to me. Things I think were designed to scare me in to staying with him.   When he almost raped me, and I called Don, the next day he told me that if I had left, Don would have taken me in out of Pity. He asked me if I wanted Pity. He asked me how long it would be until Don found out how horribly selfish I am. He asked how long it would take for him to realize what kind of person I really am.   As if I'm this horrible person lurking beneath the surface. Am I really that terrible? Am I really?   Yvette thinks he said those things out of fear. That he was manipulating the situation. Keeping me through fear if he couldn't keep me through love.   Yvette and I talked today. It was nice. We managed to reestablish the rapport we'd been lacking the last week or so. Atleast, I think we did. Maybe it will help.   I had her a little worried there for a minute. I told her I hadn't considered Suicide as an option. Or atleast, hadn't considered it too seriously. Her eyes widened at that. The fact that I had had it cross my mind at all obviously worried her. She tried to convince me it wouldn't solve anything. She's right, of course, but it doesn't change the fact that on some level it's attractive due to it being the ultimate escape. Even though I wouldn't be able to avoid Shannon with his abilities, I could leave everything else behind. Perhaps that would be enough.  I think I'm done now. I think I need some thing else to distract me now. Perhaps I'll log back in to SL.

						   I had the most FABULOUS night last night...  I left to go over to D's house at about 4:30. I surprised him by getting there earlier than he expected, which was nice. I like surprising him.   We talk for a little bit, mostly just chit chat. He was still trying to get his room all straightened up. He's a very tidy person. I don't think I've ever met a guy, excepting Y's husband, who is so tidy. We discussed dinner. He'd picked up Pork at the store, not steak, but that was okay with me. I happen to like Pork just as much, (and sometimes more than) steak. So while he finished up his room, I threw together a marinade for the pork.   Then we watched Buffy's Once More With Feeling. (My FAVORITE episode, natch.) I hadn't watched it in a long time. It was a lot of fun. I tried to keep my singing along to a minimum. I didn't want to distract D from the show. ;-)   After Buffy, I laid down on the bed. I'd been fighting off a headache all afternoon, although naturally, I wasn't going to let it spoil the evening. Of course, D came over and laid down with me and gave me something to distract me from my headache... ;-)   It was Wondeful. I can't stop thinking about what a wonderful time I had last night. We had sex five times, more or less. The first and second were rather intertwined, so I suppose you could call that once if you wanted to, but I like to consider at as twice.   It started out that the first one was over a little too quickly for my tastes, D, being quite ready to go, but I didn't let that stop me. As he lay there, holding me, still inside of me, I slowly started building him back up. It was an incredible feeling. It didn't take long before he was able to continue.   And then, of course, he took care of me. ;-)   I love having him inside of me. He fills me up so completely, I ... Well... I can't really describe it better without getting mushy. And I'm trying really hard not to get too mushy. Suffice to say that it's incredible.   After my mind blowing orgasm, we managed to convince ourselves that starting dinner before it got dark was preferable to trying to grill after dark, although we were both somewhat inclined to remain in bed...   It's a good thing we did though. It took D a while to get the coals lit. And it took the meat a long while to cook. Of course that might be because D was more than a little neurotic about checking it. He hardly let the meat get warm on one side before he was turning it. It was cute. Ultimately I had to take him in hand and prevent him from turning the meat too often to get it done. But eventually, dinner was served. And it was REALLY good. The marinade was EXCELLENT, even if I do say so myself. We had steamed veggies with it. They were good, too.   We took our dinner in to his room and pretended to try and watch 40 days and 40 nights. Although truth be told, we pretty much just ate our food and then went over to the bed and boffed some more.   Did I mention how much I like having him inside of me?  Soon after D's fourth Orgasm of the evening, (Woo Hoo!) we curled up and fell asleep. I slept really good last night, considering that I had about a foot of bed space. ;-) I was really surprised at how well I slept, actually, considering it was on a twin sized bed and I'm not really a cuddly sleeper, but curled up next to D... well... It was nice. Really Nice. A girl could get used to it.   Perhaps too used to it.   *sigh*  When the alarm went off at 4:30, it seemed like it was way too soon. After a few minutes of wake up time I felt pretty good. D and I had a good morning boff, too, which was very enjoyable. I had him show me one of the positions he'd done before. The penetration on it was really nice. I only wish I could have had better access to my clit. I probably would have had one hell of an orgasm. We made a few efforts at continuing, but really we didn't have time to drag anything out since I had to leave no later than 5:30, so instead we mostly talked and cuddled.   We talked about our previous time together. Things were so much better this time over last time and I, being curious, wanted to find out why. He admitted to having been extremely nervous. More nervous than I would have thought. It was sweet. I still find it hard to believe that some girl hasn't snatched him up. He's such a great guy. A little geeky, but otherwise wonderful.   I'm going to miss him so much while he's in San Francisco. *sigh* We talked about that a bit, too. I mentioned I'd really like to go see him in San Francisco, and he really likes that idea too. I don't know if I'm going to have the money for it though. I'm thinking of trying to get some money together after school lets out and I have my days to myself again by listing all that stuff I keep saying I'm going to list on eBay. I just don't know if I'll be able to come up with enough. D offered to help, but he's going to be paying rent and paying back his mom the money she loaned him and who knows what else. I'm not sure how much help he'd be able to provide. I'm also not sure how much help I'd be willing to accept.   I really want to go see him in San Fransisco. Even more than that, I don't want him to go. Well, I do want him to go, because I know that this is something that could really help him with his future. But I'm going to miss him terribly. I wish I could be terribly selfish and ask him not to go. But I'm not going to, and I don't think he would (or should) if I did. What right do I have to make that kind of demand anyways? Especially about something so important. I would hate to be the reason why he misses out on a great opportunity.  I'll be here when he gets back, more likely than not.   Although more and more I wonder if it will be with S. Oh, things have been good these last few days. I've stopped being unhappy around him, which I'm sure makes him happier. I'm lying to him, of course, but they've been good.   How am I lying to him? I don't lie to him with words. First of all, I don't want to lie to him, and second he knows me better than that anyways. It's hard to explain, really. With his uncanny knack for reading thoughts, I have to be better than that. I lie to him with my thoughts and actions. I've compartmentalized my feelings. Around S, D is my friend and sometimes boffing buddy. Alone? I couldn't really tell you exactly what my feelings for D are. Much more than a friend.   Do I love him? Sometimes I think I might. I think I've reached that edge... straddling the cliff's edge, one foot down, one up, wavering back and forth depending on the moment. Yesterday there was a moment when he was kissing me where it was strongest.   And I am happier. Not as happy as I could be. But more content. I'm not chafing quite as bad as I was. (Although I'm still chafing a bit) And I'm happier during, or just after a visit with D than I am at other times. Being with D makes me happy.   Gods I'm going to miss him.

						   So Y was out of town all weekend for her sister's graduation.  So I mentioned on Sunday some of the things that happened, over the weekend, but I didn't cover everything. Friday, D, S, & I all played cards after S got off of work. Things went pretty well. We also played cards again on Saturday, I believe, with R. A good time was had by all. Friday, after D left, I worked on (and completed) that collage I was supposed to make for Y's birthday, woo hoo, which left me free to play and create in my Altered Book, which I hadn't had a chance to do in FOREVER. It was fun.  Monday, (Memorial Day, dontchya know) Y came back from her trip. I had already resolved that (should she not be too tired) I would make a special point of trying to have sex as a threesome again. But before I could do that, she must be picked up from the airport. S went to pick her up. While he was doing that... I came up with as legitimate an excuse I could come up with to go to Escondido... Stealing away an hour or two to spend with D before I had to go home and do the family stuff. It was really funny... I had just pulled up in front of his house when he called my cell. :-) I actually did have a legitimate need to go out, although it ended up fruitless. I was looking for my hair gel stuff. Unfortunatly they didn't have it any place I looked.   Spending time with D is always fun. We talked and cuddled. I honestly think he's the reason why I can deal with the whole S & Y thing. I really don't want to think about what I'm going to do when he's gone to San Francisco for his internship.  Did I mention that I really like cuddling with D?  I would have liked to do more, but 1) J was there watching TV and 2) we weren't sure if we should. But we had plans to see each other today. Which was really nice, naturally.   I wore my platform shoes, which I'm really not allowed to wear right now because S has more or less grounded me from, but I really wanted to wear them... So I did. We met at the pier, walked the pier, I fell on my ass once... (I blame the pier... It's got too many knotholes) It absolutely, positively, can not be the shoes I was wearing. ;-)  We walked the pier, and then D came with me to the beauty supply store to buy some hair stuff. They didn't have what I wanted... But I found a new product to try. If I don't like it, I can take it back... So that's good. Afterwards we went to Boney's to pick up Raspberries, which were on sale for $.99 a tub, which works out to be about $2-2.5 a pound. I love raspberries.   Oh, and we made some plans for tonight. I had talked to S about letting me go over tonight to spend the night. I'm really excited about it, but I'm doing my level best not to be too excited about it, in case S uses that as an excuse to cancel my plans.   We decided we would have steaks for dinner, most likely, and I'm going to bring over my swimsuit and Buffy's Once More with Feeling to show him. I ~might~ bring over Season 1 of Buffy, since he expressed some interest in seeing it... But He'd have a hell of a lot of ketchup to do.   And yes, I know that I used ketchup the condiment instead of catch up. But it looked cuter. So I did it that way. Nyah.   We left Boneys and were heading back to his car, trying to decide what to do, and we both had the same thought of going to the Monastery and walking around.  As we drove to the monastery he pointed out to me the hotel where he'd had his first sexual experience. Naturally after we walked around at the monastery for a while I obliged him by showing him where my first time was. Mine wasn't as pleasent as his, unfortunatly. ;-)  We went back to where his car was parked and sat and talked and made out and talked and made out and... well... You get the idea...   Oh. And we talked about my altered book... He was probing in to the meaning of some of what I put in to it.   I like that he's interested.   Some of it was embarrassing but I felt comfortable enough to share that with him, so it was okay.   I also told him about this blog. Naturally enough he almost-but-not-quite asked for the website. It was cute. You could tell he wanted to be able to read it, but at the same time didn't want to invade my privacy. We talked about it. Ultimately I decided I would go ahead and give him the address, and he could decide for himself if it was too invasive. :-P   Anyways, I enjoyed my morning very much. I like being around D. He makes me feel good.   Until Next Time

						    Granted   She cries inside Each time he walks away She smiles as he does To hide all the pain   When will he notice When will he care When will it matter If she's not there   He used to feel so close He used to be so near Now it seems that days pass While she waits for him to appear   How long has it been Since She saw love in his eyes? How long will it be? How long will she wait?   He's taking her for granted He's walking away And each time he does A little piece of her dies  May 29th, 2004
