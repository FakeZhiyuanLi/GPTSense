      it has now been a week. the gayest week of my life. enough with the probing. the people i was talking to have vanished. someone was mumbling something about 'reprogramming' to 'better serve the company needs'. the "management" (as i have named them.) have started to take us to the back and begin our "meetings".  i do not know what the meeting has in store for me. i just have to resist as much as possible. maybe i will survive.

      you know what i miss about the outside world? nobody just wakes you up in the middle of a nap and starts gang probing you. don't these things have any sense of chivalry? i have to be whined and dined, and would it kill you to get some lube or at least use some spit? oh well.  apparently, everyone here gets probed at least once a day. some unlucky bastard gets it twice. poor unfortunate soul. i think i see some sunlight. cracks in the wall tease you with hints of what you think is sunlight.  these days really suck. i need to find a way out.

      i finally had contact with my captors. their voices are very low and serial-killer like. i was waiting for them to yell out "IT PUTS THE LOTION IN THE BASKET!" i think i recognized what looked like a tentacle and a hoof. they asked me question after question about my species and our abilities. i refused to and answer anything, which, when i think about it, really wasn't the best thing to do.   have you ever been gang probed? several different people surrounding you, gazing at your insides as if they were reading the newest edition maxim. the thing about being gang probed is that after about ten minutes you pass out. then comes the worst part. you wake up crying. crying so hard you want to kick your own ass. after you're done crying your stretched ass off and after you think you've got control over your bowels. (which you don't, it takes about a week. my friend next hole over told me.) you start to wonder about your manhood.   did i like that? does that make me gay? would lube have heighten the sensation? why am i thinking like this?  i hope the entire time isn't like this. (or do i)

      i still don't know where i am. contact has been made with another person in another hole. they too have no idea where we are. for our own safety we will not exchange names or any other information.  some hard stench is becoming stronger since my arrival. the screams from another place have silenced, maybe our captors have put that person out of their misery. i hope my fate does not come at such pain.  i start to think back and wonder how did i get here?  i was applying for a job at the local government building, then all of a sudden. blam! have you ever been hit in the head with anything? the hit is not the thing you worry about, it is the rapid loss of your bowels. you get hit so hard that you feel like shitting your pants and pissing all over yourself. it is sort of a relaxing pain. now i know what that smell is.  i hear someone coming....i better stop here for my own safety.

      waking up in your own urine is not fun nor is it the most desirable way to wake up. the urine stench also comes with a headache. a headache i have never experienced before, even when i drank too much. maybe this large dent in my skull is the reason i have the headache.i don't know where i am. i just know i hear voices of other people around me.  am i blind? are the voices just in my head? where am i? how did i get here? why am i here? what day is?  i hope i can survive the next couple of days.  -will
