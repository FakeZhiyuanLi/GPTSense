      Today I got into a fight with my "boyfriend" just because I asked him nicely to not cuss at me when he gets angry at me. How hard is that?! Couples fight all the time and when I fight, I never stoop to name calling and cursing the person out.....how unproductive and juvenile. It's not like we're teenagers anymore. He was upset because when we were at the movies, he went to get a drink and popcorn. His credit card was denied because the company thought there was fraudulent activity going on. He comes back to his seat and tells me. Because I didn't jump up and run and get the stuff, he calls me inconsiderate and comments how he was not impressed by my lack of reaction. In discussing this later on, I asked him if he felt I was an incosiderate girlfriend and if he could name some considerate things I've done. I couldn't believe he said I was inconsiderate and he couldn't name a considerate thing I've done! So even though I'm not one to rehash, I'll do it for argument's sake:  1. I paid (without being asked) for 90% of our outing including trips, expensive restaurants, etc 2. I paid for an operation to have a potential cancerous growth on his temple to be removed 3. I gave him hour-long back rubs without being asked (just because I wanted to do it for him) 4. I buy stuff for his daughter and take care of her (such as "potty breaks" during our outings) even though she is a mean child to me and it's not fair to my children who are well-behaved 5. I bought him clothes, jewelry, etc (and that's not on occasion such as birthdays)  That is a smidge of what I do and never ask for anything in return except communication and respect. And what does he do? He hung up on me like a teenage girl! The man is 37 years old and he couldn't hold an adult discussion without throwing a tantrum and hanging up.  So, let's rehash what he has done for me....not that this ever mattered....but since he thinks I'm being ridiculous:  1. Took me to one concert / one comedy show 2. Took me on one trip 3. Paid for 10% of our outings  Everyone's right.....I DO have a sign on my head that says, "Naive woman, pretty boys apply and take advantage."

      Since 9/11 we have been bombarded with horrific images of war, chaos, and pure evil. And now here we are again. For the past week, we have been shocked and outraged by the Nick Berg beheading video. I have been a mild news junkie until the release of Iraqi prisoner abuse photos and Nick Berg's death. Along with the world I was glued to the set during 9/11 and am now glued to the set (and internet) to the latest happenings in Iraq. I saw the gruesome images of Nick being brutally murdered and cannot believe how one human being can do that to another. I know it's evil and I know those men are animals. But I still can't fathom how someone can start sawing another man's head off and not feel anything when he hears that man screaming. What has this world come to? There are times I feel like taking my kids and moving elsewhere (like some obscure place such as New Zealand). But what good would that do? The evil will just be there one step behind....

      When I found out that Ronald Reagan died, a part of me felt like another nail was driven into the coffin lid of my childhood. Reagan was the president during the best years of my life—my teenage years. Those definitely were the years of being carefree, kid-free, and bill-free. Nothing mattered except what my girlfriends and I were planning on doing each approaching weekend. I wasn’t always so non-caring, though. I did care about my future and the “state of the nation.” And I’m not one of those people that dwell on the glory years. But still…. Seeing people I love, such as my grandparents and father, people I grew up with, such as Tom Landry and Reagan, as well as things that were icons of my past fade away just feels a bit lonely and final. It’s as if I see the back of a childhood version of me walking in the distance. Sad thing is she doesn’t know I’ve stopped to watch her walk away from me….into the horizon she goes without turning around to say goodbye.
