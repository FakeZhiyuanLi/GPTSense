       yes, this week is deader than last because FINALS NEXT WEEK! AH! of all the times to procrastinate... BUT I CANT HELP MYSELF! if i tried to study, nothing would happen. so yesterday i watched  the matrix  instead... =P  lets see... saturday. woke up, tried to do work, and nothing happened, so i watched  the matrix  and afterwards i was all ready to work, and them mom says were going to my aunts house to celebrate my 'grandparents' who arent really, but we call me that... 40th wedding anaversery. so we got there, went to church, and then went back. it was supposed to be a surprise party and when we got there the first time no one had arrived, so we got back and who do you know but DAVY and RACHEL pull up right in front of us. XD!  so we eat, take jennifer hostage and throw pillows at her, then we sit down and watch TV for basically the rest of the party. but then jennifer [annoying little brat that she is] told my mom that i slapped her [which i guess i did, i slapped her on the stomach with my foot and apparently it made a big red mark] but come on, she was the one kicking and biting AND slapping too. before she ran to my mom, she slapped my leg [AND IT HELLA HURT] and i said, 'you're lucky ur my cousin or i'd slap u back' and she was hella pissed, you could tell... how old is jennifer? i think shes like 5 or 6. dude, she weighs more than josh or aaron... and thats not saying a lot because josh n aaron are like sticks.  um... then ya, we watched TV (the frog farted...) and then i went down stairs to get a drink, and tipped a little 'vodka' into my drink. the bottle said vodka, but davy said it smelled like rubbing alcohol... O.o'  i dumped it out and got a new drink... and then our parents said it was time to go... and 20 minutes later they said it was time to go again... and then 30 minuets later they said it was time to go... and finally 10 minutes later, it was time to go. um... um... what else? ya, got home at 12 and i hadnt done ANY studying...   and now i gotta study and make my poster board, and memorize my speech and write my cheat sheet for bio.    shyt, im in DEEP SHYT!  =/ •patty•  p.s. happi b-day to chee.... haha, that rhymes

       mom and dad just got home. its crazy how quickly emotions can be changed.  they got back from visiting their friend in sacramento. at first i didnt recognize his name [b/c i have too many 'uncles' and 'aunts' who arent really but we call them that that i loose track...] and it turned out to be chrissy and laurna's dad [much easier to remember the kids] who are 'tweens.' their dad is dying. they dont think he'll last more than a week. personally, i didnt really know him. it was my obligation to say hello and stuff when ever we were at the same party or what ever, but i didnt know him. and chrissy's only lyk 13, 14... laurna's lyk 10... their dad going to be gone in a week and their mother is battling brest cancer. sad.  i feel guilty for not crying or anything. but how can you get upset about something that doesnt touch you personally?  another thing about death. while at joe's b-day, ryan interviewed his step dad whoes brother died in Vietnam when he was in 5th grade. and what's funni [not really...] is that he wrote a poem while in the war...     living and dying  take a man, put him alone, put him twelve-thousand miles from home. empty his heart of all but blood, make him live in sweat and mud. this is the life I have to live, and why my soul to the devil i give. but you dont know what its like over here, you have your parties and drink your beer. you all want to ban the bomb, theres no real war in Vietnam.  you use drugs and have your fun, then refuse to use a gun. theres nothing else for you to do, and i'm supposed to die for you. theres one thing you dont know, and thats where i think you should go. i'm already here, its too late. i've traded all my love for hate. i'll hate you till the day i die, cause you made me hear my buddy cry. i saw his arm, a bloody shred, i heard them say "this one's dead"  its a large price i have to pay, to try and live another day. we had the guts to fight and die. he paid the price, but what did he buy?  by dying your life he buys. but how gives a damn if a soldier dies? his wife, family, to include his son, but they're about the only ones-  --gordon a. fish, died in vietnam    thats enough emotions for one weekend....  •patty•

       this is the weekend before dead week folks. and im dead...  lets see... friday i got home, and did nothing.  satruday... omg, saturday. mom woke me up at 8, and they decided they wanted to set up my new desk. i thought they had forgotten about the retreat. so my mom n i transfered my old [crappy] desk to the work room [which now has more space b/c they replaced the huge table with my small [crappy] one. and they got me a nice new desk. so i had gone downstairs to eat breakfast after moving the table into the other room at 8:30. and ate and then mom says to hurry b/c im going to the retreat.   urlLink    i got hella mad and we fought for an hour or so (luckily, ryan and dad left at the beginning b/c they went to help my aunt move into her new [cool] house (god, everybody in my family is moving!  urlLink   )  so then by the time we fight its past 9, and i've won. so i storm upstairs to do homework, and an hour or so later mom comes in and says maybe im just going to get there another way and i have to make my own mistakes. so she lets it be...  so then we set up my new table. but i did the most work since mom was giving way. and it was kinda pathetic, and depressing because i started eating a lot. and when im depressed i eat a lot, but eating when im depressed makes me depressed because i'm gaining weight and all that girl crap. which makes me depressed all over again. and i'm still slighly depressed over that, but im better now, and i can eat without wanting to cry.  urlLink     um... ya   and then later, we went to sacramento and celebrated my cousins 25th b-day. joe got a tongue ring... so gross. its got a ying-yang on it. i'd upload the lovely pix. but the website isnt working rite now. maybe later. so then we left and dropped my aunt off at her house and i smuggled more candy home props. to NIKKI! YAY!  got home at 12am, fell asleep.  woke up, went to church. came back, finished my desk [by myself, b/c dad was being a baby and said if it was just one part i needed to do it myself, so i did] um... but the internet connection wouldnt reach to my computer anymore [that damned hole in my wall, that dad was supposed to fix since last summer] so now i set up my computer but the things a mess.  and my brother is going crazy because therez a virus in his new computer and when he gets mad... hes like a calm version of steven. so he screams and gets histerical, but not like ready to kill. [he has A.D.D.  and hes always been a little weird, but hes ok] but unlike steven, his anger lasts. in fact, i can hear him pounding around rite now, throwing drawers closed and pounding the mouse on my parents computer b/c he's trying to get something off there.  um... i still have 140 pages to read of  a very long engagement  by tomorrow. so i gotta ignore everybody and just read. and it doesnt help that its really hard to follow...   beyond books monday. quiz bowl tuesday.  history essay on thursday.  i know im forgetting something...   um... ya, thats my dead weekend.   •patty•

       WTF! i dont want to go to some stupid retreat and miss my cousins b-day party (even if he is a jerk... no seriously)  i had already expressed to my mother how i dont want to go through confirmation, yet she still expects me to participate in it fully. WTF! its the last 'class' before summer and then we start ALL OVER AGAIN in 10th grade... and i've missed NOTHING compared to other people.   i'm refraining to say anything bad about anyone online...   but my anger level is high... very high.

       ok, 2 day was a bad day...  i had fallen asleep the nite before early than i wanted to. i had just written up my speech thing for spanish, and i was trying to memorize it, but i was so tired (lack of sleep from the nite b4 the nites prior) i just fell asleep on the couch, and then my dad kicked me out and sent me back to my room where i fell instantly alseep.   morning on the way to school i started to memorize the beginning part of my speech, as well as at school.  2° it was chaos, nobody did anything, and it was anarchy.  advisory° um... a study hall, worked on memorizing my speech, willson was the sub.  history° again w/ mz. (or is it mrs. now? i 4get...) willson, pretty boring.  lunch° trying to memorize my speech one last time  6° ah, presentations. luckily, my group was last... unluckily the bell rang and we still had to go... she said we could leave, but everybody had left and it was the best time to make the speech, esp. b/c i start stumbling on words when i'm nuvrous and the fact that it was in spanish made it worse. so i decided to stay after school. that means i miss the bus, which means i had to walk to the mall... (and i didnt get the grade i'd hoped, but it wasnt' totaly horrible) and on the way there, i saw the bus pass me. so i was kinda pissed off, so i started walking home (a 45 minute walk, if you're in REALLY LATE and worried UR COACH who you're trying to make a good impression on so you can make the VOLLEYBALL team, and ur mom runs out on u and ur dads at work and the stupid bus didn't come. so i started my lonely walk home, constantly calling my dad. who reluctantly agreed to pick me up. he picked me up 1/2 way there n says im walking on the rong side of the road.  i'm relli drained rite now, lack of sleep, stressed, but it's almost over... slowly but surely, almost over... one big hurtle passed, couple more to go and im home free.  oh ya, n my arm hurts from the battle of dawn. this morning i could hardly move it, and if i did, it moved at 1 mph. i guess slinging the water balloons in such a way made me use muscles i normally dont use, so now i'm HELLA sore, and very grouchie...  11 more days... 1 more days...  •patty•

HELLA pix. that'll be cool...  lets find more pix to post up... since im procrastinating...           O.O    hmm... who sent this to me? i think it was- alisha. yes she sent it to me (and she did some lovely graffiti, i esp. like the label SCARY on davy...) and davy, btw, gina thinks alisha's your gf.

MWAHAHAHA! I WIN!   o.o ok no...  lol, i gotta scan more pix. later...  i've had a recent obsession with pictures... i dont know why... but i do. and damn ryan took the camera today.  what other pictures mite there be, hidden in the files of my computer?

       well, lets see... its been two days. what's happened?  lets see, yesterday, i woke up at 12pm, lunch time, having slept at 3:30am that same morning. i don't remember what i did the rest of the day, i think i played pokémon. *blushes* then i wrapped victoria's present and mom and dad went off to some party and then i got picked up and left ryan alone. and it was a bit awkward because i didn't know too many people, but they had CANDY! i was happy.  omg, we had to wait for 45 minutes for the weding reception to end... can you believe that? roberta and craig were  wedded  in a bowling alley (and left DARK CHOCOLATE OUT! it was wrapped, don't worry... *smiles innocently*), AS WELL AS THE RECEPTION... kinda tacky, they were walking around in bowling shirts with the words  bride  and  groom  on the back. weirdness...  so, ya, we bowled, bowling is not my sport...  mom and dad INSISTED on picking me up at 11, and stuff... got home at like 12... stayed up the whole night (though if it was from insomnia or the exessive amounts of coke i drank, i'm not sure...) and at 5:30 i went for a walk. i walked places at random and found myself in the park where niko had his birthday party, where we used to play in the bushes... it was like a fort. then i saw forster city school from that park and the park next to it was where i had originally planned on going, thought i'd take a different way though... so i went around taking random pictures and the ravens' were going batty... shrieking at me... and i walked home, through the complex, the way i never go... it was really sentimental, especially because i used to roam the complex with this scooter gang, but then i got hungry.   so i went home, took in the paper, ate, and cleaned up the kitchen because nobody had bothered to the night before... there was moldy rice sitting on the counter *blanches* lovely...   went back to my room and changed back into my p.j.s hoping nobody would be the wiser, because mom would throw a fit. as soon as i got back out of my room, mom was up (shes a morning person, while i'm a night person)... she thought it was curious i was up early, asked if something was wrong...  she went downstairs and asked if i had read the paper, which was still neatly folded so obviously i hadn't, but she seemed oblivious to my answer anyway and started reading...   i asked her why my brother's memory was so bad... usually he gets up earlier than me to go downstairs and play video games, and then when i get downstairs i ask him how long he's been there and he can't answer, he can't even estimate! it's horrible...  so i went back to bed at 7:30, and woke up at 10:25 (THATS ONLY 3 HOURS! *grumbles*) mom because mom was shouting 2 minutes and then i realized we were going to church... it was a special mass, it was in honor or fr. tom's 50 years as a priest *whistles* talk about old, but he's cool...  lets see, jennifer bounced at me a little while later and played with my arm for most of the mass... she always trys to get my attention, its so annoying... there was a party after the mass and i kinda slipped back to the car to wait... i don't like the bowditch kids, that's all there is over there... so i waited for an hour (and the mass had taken abnormally long as well, especially for fr. tom who talks extreamingly fast and usually ends mass with like 10 minutes to go). woke up gina... ate some lovely homemade salsa my parents make (SO GOOD!) and then we FINALLY went home. and now i'm here... i almost feel asleep again, but gina woke me up... *smirks*   and that is my story *bows*  hope you are all having a better life than i am... ta •patty•

       i'm bored... so i decided to update...  i update too much... i have no life.  so... i'll explain in depth my boring day, ready?  um... i think i woke up a little before 10 and lay in bed for a few minutes listening to see if ryan was up. he was, i could hear the little white noise that meant he was playing video games... that poor boy is STUCK...  i got up... and i kinda wondered around for a minute before remembering my anger mother last night.  she stormed into my room at about 9 that night and said something along the lines of "i dont care what your father says, i want you in bed by 10!" (because my dad didn't care what time we slept, as long as we got at least 8 hours of sleep...) i told her i write best at night and finally pushed it till my [official] bed time was at 12, and i could stay on the computer... but no internet or fone calls *suddenly laughs hysterically*. and she was sound asleep 20 minutes later and i was on the internet... oh ya, got a call from gina at about 12 *smirks* but i hade to hide under my covers and gina was in her closet... and i mean come on... thats the time i get FREE MINUTES!  okok, back to today... what happened? nothing.   then i remember browsing around the internet and stuff, and being totally bored to death.  i typed up 8 pages last night... but i can't do anything today... my capacity to think is drained...   and now i'm listening to michael bublé (BUBBLES! LOL)...  and tino emailed me again, and she's wondering why i'm never on aim (fyi, she doesn't know about my other sn... so DONT TELL HER OR I SWEAR I WILL KICK YOUR ASS)   um... um... oh ya, i cleaned today too. haha... i demolished the three piles school work on my floor to one very small stack of papers and junk, but i didn't feel like tackling those... i think after that i should clean my closet... its a mess. i was poking around in this bin and there was hella random shyt in there...   oh, i wanted to write a MWPP... but i'm in the middle of another, so i'm torn... plus i can't write anyways, i wrote hard for the last three nights... and now my imagination is stripped bare... AND HP IS STILL DOWN, IM ABOUT TO HAVE A BLOODY HEART ATTACK IF THE DAMN WEBMASTER, JAY, DOESN'T HURRY UP!    damn you people, and you don't even care! why do i bother... because a stupid cousin mine decided to get me hooked... who now isn't even interested in the same topic i am anymore... DAMN HER! *huffs* something about orlando bloom or josh groban or something or other...  which reminds me, she started spouting random names and told me to look them up (because pathetic old me didn't have a clue the girl was talking about) and then gave me what she thought of them and their 'datability'... that poor mixed up filipina american brain of hers...  then she came to a deigo luna who i SWEAR looked like those two mexican twins... diego luna stared in dirty dancing: havana nights and y tu mama tambien (WHOSE DIRECTOR DID THE CRAP JOB OF DIRECTING HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN... sorry, i'm very touchy about that...)  and dad just came in and took over my computer. said soemthing wasn't right with the sound and started playing random josh groban music... haha, it was my aunt, who hooked my dad, who hooked my family, me included, who hooked gina...  btw, french is a funny language, no offense. but it's absolutely facinating how the words are comared to how they sound, so unlike english... but I STILL HATE THE FRENCH SONGS!    which reminds me... SOMEONE was spouting random tagalog and me, who doesn't speak any other language [fluently] other than english was BUGGING me... i blame my parents. *points at them*  i've decided i have to name the little purple boinging thing tita sarah gave to me... ITS SO COOL! (i found it again while going through my closet!) am i pathetic for naming it? i probably am, but i'm not in a caring mood right now... HE CAN BE MY MUSE! OMG! [i've suddenly decided it looks like a he] ya... i'll come up with a name...    wow, and that's the play by play account of my day... well, at least, what i can remember of it ;P (gee, i think i actually kept my fone calls to gina under 10 today! i think i talk to her too much... she's starting to rub off on me...)  i'm sorry to say that my fans probably won't get to hear what happens after i finish typing this... they'll be torn! *sob sob*   am i little weird today... ignore EVERYTHING you read above previously... i was ranting... but, it's good to rant. gets it out of your system.  hope you're having a nice life... ta patty

       agg, tino emailed me... *pales sickly* i'm afraid to not respond, but afraid to do so at the same time... what if that encourages her?  she sent me a cheesy greetingcard.... something about national chocolate eclair day *mouth waters, slaps herself*  i've been starving myself from sugar... or at least trying to. (why, WHY IN GODS NAME did ryan have to convince my mother to buy fruit rollups? those are SO addicting... luckily, aaron, joshua and jennifer stole most of them... damn kids)   besides that, its been boring.  have a nice life patty

       mom is making it impossible to enjoy summer to the fullest. she wants me to enter in the foster city international writer's contest... oooh, aaah. either that or volunteer to do crafts and read to kids... sorry, but i'm not a crafts person and reading to kids is not my favorite thing to do, so i  have  to enter the first one...  brilliant. just bloody brilliant (wow... doesn't that sound british? XP).  but, it makes for good money... not that the chances of me getting any money are very high, virtually none if you asked me...  hm... fiction, children's story, humorous peice/personal essay, or poetry? *groans*   i think i'll go sulk.    my 'cleaness' is starting to get to me. cleaning dust like mad, though not litteraly cleaning up per say. dust is one thing, actually moving all my crap is another.   *dramatically* WHY O, WHY IS GOD TORTURING ME SO!  yep, summer's like that. sleeping in, sitting around, stuffing my face, CLEANING... it's an endless, thought not very productive, cycle.   am i just bored? or boring? pathetic, isn't it. i am so incredibly pathetic.

       you know what's the most annoying thing in the world? insomnia... i kept waking up every hour. you know what's the second most annoying thing in the world? being waken up... *glares at some random korean kid* but the ultimate most annoying thing in the world is having your eyelashes poked at when you're asleep...  so like i said, i kept waking up every hour. then had a wake up call from chee, so then i finally get up and mom and dad decided that instead of going to church at 9 as planned, we'd go at 5, so i woke up for nothing. i went back to sleep, well, kinda sorta just lay in a stupor, and then at 11 i heard jennifer's voice so i got ready.   first thing i have to do when i get downstairs is make desert. so i start, and then i realize i messed up. i mixed the filling with the crust... i wouldn't try it, but mom and dad said it was edible... =/  we're babysitting josh, aaron, and jennifer while their parents go to a wedding. fun... jennifer's all sour because she lost a point in foosball. ryan got all pissed off, you know how he is...  and they shut down hp again. DAMMIT! WTF! it'll take a week because webmaster is transfering to a different server...   ok, thats all...  happy father's day kids...  •patty•

       today was an odd day... i woke up earlier than everybody which was odd because i'm usually the last one awake. woke up at 9 instead of 11. kinda just was lazy the first few hours then i had to get john and jackie moving because their parents were going to come pick them up at 3.   but what was the oddest was i CLEANED... i mean i CLEANED. i went crazy. i cleaned the whole kitchen... disinfected and vacuumed... EVERYTHING! also vacuumed the entrance hall... and was thinking about vacuuming the living room but john and ryan were sprawled on it and all their games everywhere... so i vacuumed the downstairs bathroom, and then went upstairs and vacuumed my room, the kids bathroom, AND RYANS ROOM! (that boy TOTALLY owes me... while i've been working my butt off around the house he's been glued to the gc... which only reminds me that i used to be like that =/) jackie was so bored i gave her some windex and she cleaned ryans mirror AND my window... FROM THE OUTSIDE. you should'a seen her face XD! um... ya.   babysitting sucks. especially kids who are pampered. they leave everything out (like my brother) and spill and i end up cleaning up after them... hell, i even ended cleaning up after my parents who were so lazy they just pots and pans everywhere...   its been insane. i've been cleaning like CRAZY...   no, i'm not a clean freak half the time... i just have occasional sprees where if i don't i go crazy...   yep.   they got picked up at 3 (brought some YUMMY CHAMPAGNE MANGOES, MMM, MMM, MMM) and left. THANK GOD! my room is actually clean again... well, sorta. cleaner than it was when jackie was hanging around. =/  oh, and i can't forget it's adam's b-day on the 21st... he stole my planner and wrote that in *rolls her eyes*    and thats about it.  have a nice life! •patty•

       ok, three things:  one, my parents are getting pissed off at how much i've been calling gina back and forth and are afriad i've gone over my 300 minutes per month (well, i could CONFIRM if i did if they hand't changed the PASSWORD *fumes*) so i gotta ask my dad if he can add the cordless in my room since its just sitting around and stuff...  secondly, mom got an email from crockett.    When it became clear just two weeks ago that only one of the teachers   in Constantinople would be looping with his students, the logical,   albeit painful, choice seemed to be to close that house.    they're closing constantinople... i'd really it reather have been kyoto... because its just.... there. constantinople's got good kids, merkesh's (spelling?) got all the smart kids, and florence has the most spirit. kyoto's got all the kids who don't care... SO SHUT THEM DOWN!   what the crap. (i've taken to saying that a lot since the cousins have been here... better then saying the BAD 'F' word... but i'm afraid it'll stick... =/ WHAT THE CRAP!!!)  thirdly... victoria's having a b-day party! yay... except, i'm afraid TINO is going to be there, then she's going to complain how we haven't comunitcated at all and shyt... or maybe she's already moved *hopes to god*   um.... besides that... lifes been pretty boring. as always.  i'm afraid i'm becoming lazy and eating a lot *cries*   its a very scary time in my life....   ok, have a nice life! =D  •patty•

       pissed off? angry? i dont know...  mom thinks i'm hostile.   my cousins decided the wanted to go bowling... fun... i'm sorry, i dont like bowling.  and then, she kept trying to explain stuff to me, bowling stuff. she kept trying to point figures out on the board... where i couldn't see because of my stupid glasses.   and then she got all offended. the worst thing she can do is confront it.   omg, just dont get me started.   lets just say i'm royally pissed off (but my mother only increased it)  i dont know why... damn hormones.   i hate growing up...   but mom promotes it. its imposible to live with her.     i wanna jump of a cliff...

       i'm so tired...   friday left at 9 and went camping somewhere up in north california along the coast. kinda did nothing the frist day, the next day we went hiking. it was boring, it was flat, and i was the first one back. over ate SO MUCH... (thats what you get when you get a gathering of filipino's... =/) around 10 i was alone at the camp (cause all my cousins were asleep and the parents and stuff were showering) and a skunk came wondering into the camp while i was trying to brush my teeth. and of course i tried to scare it away, but i didn't want to get sprayed to i jumped back into my tent and feel asleep. then today...  finished  the da vinci code . i agree, i liked  angels and demons  better, but  the da vinci code  was the shocker, it was just one shock after another... a bit farfetched too... driving back, theres a narrow road with LOTS of twists and turns, and my mom was speeding, i swear. she also wanted a shorter car so she could drive faster O.O" wow...  now, i'm home... THANK GOD!  but tomorrow (or is it tuesday?) i get to start my 'baby-sitting' job... taking care of jackie and john till thrusday and nikki is coming on wednesday i think....  lovely. just lovely.  also, have another camping trip in two weeks, this time, for the patron side. *sighs*  i HATE cleaning up afterward... its HORRIBLE...  AND amazingly, i didn't get bitten by misquitos, truly a miricle.    thats all...  •patty•

(prolly get carpol tunnel disease in the process, but do i care?  maybe in the future...)  oh ya, and reading. because freshmen year was pretty damn close to hell, so i'm taking ALL 3 MONTHS TO DO ABSOLUTLY FREAKEN NOTHING!   except typing, reading, and bugging my cousins friends online.... with the possible trip somewhere.... just fyi  and it's been REALLY windy over here like you can't believe!  i found this relli funni clip online called  urlLink 'the odyssey'  FUNNI! a stick figure clip, but funni...  um... thats about it folks.  have a nice life!  •patty•

       hello again. haven't written in a while. things have been kinda busy, kinda slow...  lets see...  last i updated i was in boring las vegas... we stayed one more night at which i slept at 12:30 and woke up at 4:30 to catch a plane back to san francisco. couple hours later we had to attend a wedding (people i didnt know) we got there late, and went to the reception at 'citizen cake's.' boring. we had fun blowing bubbles and watching my cousin brandon (my 2nd cousin, to all my STALKERS out there...) slip on the floor and run soap out of his eyes. david and rachel came back to our house... was pretty uneventful until rachel found a can of silly string in my room. which then david snuck up behind me and sprayed silly string all over me, and ran away. and i sprayed him and rachel and then he tried to hide behind his mother from me and stuff. he scared me by going onto the balcony and banging on my window, which i again attacked him with silly string. that was basically the highlight of my day. watched 'calander girls' with my parents and went to bed at 12 (i was dead tired by then... pretty busy day)   next day (today) woke upat 11:30 which was very unatural given that even if i had slept at 2 i probably would have woken up at 9 or 10. but i kind of just hung around the house. ryan went to the arts & wine festival at around 2 and i started reading my latest book 'zipped' which i finished just now, so i decided to write this. but i had to stop in the middle of it and go to church.   and thats all...   i still cant believe its summer. i'm afraid i'll wake up tomorow at 7:30 and wake up the whole house wondering why nobody is awake and theres school and stuff. and then i'll go back to bed.     i'm really bored now. i want to read 'the da vinci code' but for some reason i cant focus on the story. i tried to read it on wednesday when i got it, but so far, it's not as exciting as the first. so instead, i read 'the garden' in las vegas and now i'm bored.   this is pretty messed up. i dont know why. i think i'm still stressed, but about what i dont know. i keep feeling like i'm forgetting something. like a term paper or something. it's bugging me.  well, i think i know what it is. but i can't just seem to bring myself to do so. some girl is mad at me because i havent done ANYTHING about it in the past 2 months. i want to, but i can't and it's driving me up the wall.    am i just crazy? or am i crazy?   i think i'm in denial.    i'm restless, i need to DO something. but i'm to tired to do so at the same time.    i'm going to stop rabling now.

       hola kids...  lets see thursday. got off school, went to the airport, got on a plane, and was in las vegas 5 after getting out of school. =D  crashed in my cousins hotel, went swiming at dusk (they ran out of towels... bad service XD)then went to the computer room, then played ping pong and foosball, went back to the computer room and my (older) cousin ordered us to go back to the suit (it was 12am) so went back, tried to finish reading my book (i started after school yesterday) i had lyk 30 more pages, but it was 2am and i was relli tired, so i feel asleep.  mom came boucing into my room at 9 (i cannot survive with 7 hours of sleep) we watched harry potter (a major disapointment, didn't do justice to the book, but still fun) mom n dad n aunt n uncle went to go visit my 'uncle/lolo' in the hospital (not the one whoes dying) so we hung out a bit (finished my book) and now i'm here...  so that sums up my 2 days...  because i know you were all just dying to know WHY i didn't update ONE DAY...  thats pretty pathetic, but i'm a boring person, remember?  •patty•

       mr. alfalma died... he was a math teacher at hillsdale. ryan's devastated, he tends to very emotional for a guy. everyone was devastated, from what i've heard, he was a cool teacher. but he died, on monday...  and then theres my uncle and the war in iraq. theres so much death right now. it's going to be a hard week. there was a memorial outside mr. alfalma's room and posters all over the school.   ryan's greatest fear is death, so he's really shaken up. i realize that i'm not so much afraid of death as pain. a painful death is my greatest fear, a slow painful death. but i don't want to think about death in the literal sense anymore...   i'm dead because of the finals. had my bio. final, thank god thats said and done. but i totally bombed my presentation. i was cramming a 4 minute presentation into my head 20 minutes before i had to repeat it. not good. about a minute in i blanked. i literally blanked. i couldnt remember anything. but crockett was nice. she said because i did well on my essay (an A! HELL FRIKEN YA! IT HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN AN A! I WORKED HELLA HARD ON THAT ESSAY... the night before  urlLink   ) so now i got time to prepare... lets just hope i dont PROCRASTINATE!  but i dont have to worry about my spanish final (my next final) we got HELLA points extra credit that if i bombed the verbs part of the test, i'd still get AN A+! THATS MORE THAN HALF THE TEST! HELL FREAKEN YA!   and i'm not worried about geometry. its you either know it or you dont. and besides, we get a page of notes...  things are looking up, but i wish i had my humanities final behind me already... thats the killer...   ok, enough puns and references... i got A's to earn...  ta ta~  •patty•

       Agg, I'm totally out of it.     &nbsp;  I can't say anything I'll really regret. That was what I promised myself when I made this blog, and I have to keep it (because my mom is already getting suspicous).    &nbsp;  I probably broke the rule right there...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Totally and fully OUT OF IT...    &nbsp;  I'm so skrewed. I'm a bloody nothing (Think I broke the rule again... How 'bout we skrew the rule?).    &nbsp;  I've been&nbsp;a fat sitting potato all summer long. Nothing. Nada.&nbsp;Zilch.&nbsp;Zip.&nbsp;     Kill me now.    I'm probably feeling this way because of my mother (If you hadn't guessed).     &nbsp;  I've always been a bit anti-social... since the 5th grade. And, come on, the best friends you have in 3rd grade don't count just because you sat next to them the first day of school.     You&nbsp;probably are thinking, what the hell is she talking about. SHUT UP AND LET ME VENT! I'll probably erase this afterwards anyways. And if I don't, it'll just be another bad day...    I'm regretting it already.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm going to meet up Katlin tomorrow and hang out with her. Of course, it&nbsp;became this whole fiasco because my dad is always telling me that&nbsp;I&nbsp;haven't hung&nbsp;out with anybody from school this summer (he's also the one that constantly reminds me I'm fat... but, ya' gotta love him). And my mom is freaking out because she doesn't know where she lives, although we've dropped her off at her house. Half the time she says&nbsp;she trusts me and lets me&nbsp;do what I want, and the other half she&nbsp;thinks I'm going to get myself killed.    We were going hiking in the Utah area and we went to this&nbsp;cliff that over looked an 's' bend in the river. My mom is terrified&nbsp;of hights, as is my brother. So&nbsp;Auntie&nbsp;Camille's son&nbsp;and I were lying on our fronts peeking right over the edge, and even&nbsp;Antie Camille was getting nervous. So she sat betwen us and held on to our shirts. Mom got HELLA&nbsp;pissed at me.&nbsp;She starting yelling and screaming and commenting (not very nice things). And her best friend is trying to calm her down.    &nbsp;  Trust me&nbsp;does she. Trust her best friend?    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That was all&nbsp;totally irrelevant, but&nbsp;an example of the many times she has show she is a HYPOCRITE. And just last night she was going on about fufilling promises and crap.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Kinda makes you want to just.... jump of a cliff.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Okay, ignore everything I just said.    &nbsp;  Oh, and instead of going to London or Greece or Australia... because of the amount of time we have, we have decided to go to Alaska.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I've never been to Alaska.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Then to Las Vegas for business and then to a JOSH GROBAN concert. Gina hates me, I know.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Wow, and my anger level dropped like 10 degrees.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   DAMN HORMONES!  &nbsp;  THE END

       Aah, ok. So, the camping trip didn't go as planned. We were supposed to leave at 9 a.m. But I woke up at 10 instead and we didn't leave until noon. The traffic was absolutly horrible, so we didn't get there until about 9.     &nbsp;   We spent the whole damn day in the car...     &nbsp;   Found out some disturbing information wich has to do with my mom and  the da vinci code      &nbsp;   Hardly slept. I think that was the first time I was homesick... But anyways, I was up at like 3 a.m. when my mom has this bad dream and she started thrashing about and beating me to death. Then my dad wakes her up and she tells us that she dreamed an attacker had gotten into our car and went into the tent and was trying to take me away. Which is ironic because as she was trying to save me in her dream she was beating me to death in real life. (Figures...)     &nbsp;   Didn't sleep until long after that... Had a very disturbing dream.     &nbsp;   Next day, we went on a hike that should have only been about 2 miles, but it ended up being something like 6 miles... Not to mention it was climbing up this mountain and stuff and it was sweltering hot. We were at this one point and a dog came around the corner, and me without my glasses, thought it was a wolf for a minute or something... O_O&nbsp; LOL.     &nbsp;   Um, we got back late. I think we went mini golfing after that... I sucked... My cousins wanted to go to the driving range. (I hit&nbsp;4 and made a complete and utter fool of myself)     &nbsp;   Went to mass, it was outside.     &nbsp;   Then my dad wanted to go crawdading... That was the highlight of my day. We didn't have a net, but instead&nbsp;we had those prongs you stick marshmellows on to roast 'em. So&nbsp;my cousins and my dad troop into&nbsp;this mucky stream and poke around.&nbsp;John&nbsp;was freaking out, and Ryan just kept swinging around that stupid&nbsp; cane  staff&nbsp;of his. Jackie was kinda&nbsp;freaking out too because we were just in sandels and they creatures&nbsp;kept swimming passed us.&nbsp;While we were kinda putting around in the shallows&nbsp;my dad went into the middle of the creek and&nbsp;had already caught a bunch. So I tell John and Ryan to go away if they're not helping and they do. So&nbsp;Jackie and I follow my dad, and I told myself I wan't going to get wet...&nbsp;but I did... I was up to my hips trying to catch the&nbsp;little suckers. It was pretty fun actually. My dad was&nbsp;having the time of his life...&nbsp;(He's far sighted in his old age *snigger*, so he had to put his&nbsp;glasses on... but they kept slipping off, so he&nbsp;had to wear goggles. His whole&nbsp;front got wet because we&nbsp;was bending down in the water to catch 'em.) Did you know&nbsp;crawdads swim backwards? Kinda like they're being pulled from their tails, their claws are&nbsp;out in front of them. It was fun, but&nbsp;Jackie wasn't really helping either, because she's not very coordinated. So basically it was&nbsp;me,&nbsp;Jackie, and my dad&nbsp;in this creek by the road, sticking marshmellow prongs into this&nbsp;creek and&nbsp;catching crawdads while the others sat on the bank and did nothing.&nbsp;^_^     We got back much later than we had planned.&nbsp;Ate crawdads and steak. I headed into our tent&nbsp;so I could read... But then the rest of the kids follow me, as always. Then they start making a ruckus with the&nbsp;lap&nbsp;top and laughing and stuff, and&nbsp;it's hard to read. Blah, blah, blah. Went to bed... woke up last... I had another disturbing dream.&nbsp;     Mom tried to lure me&nbsp;out with some strawberry red vines. Surprisingly, it didn't work... then Ryan came in and flashed them in my face (He loves to annoy me awake).&nbsp;We still had one more crawdad in&nbsp;cooler, so they told us to go put it in the creek.&nbsp;The kids were sacared to hold it...&nbsp;     Actually,&nbsp;I learned about crayfish in the 3rd grade. (I'm so proud of myself!)&nbsp;We paired up with the first graders and&nbsp;of course, one of them stuck their hand right in their face was she was&nbsp;crying and screaming... Of course, the crayfish held on for dear life... I'm getting side tracked.     So I picked&nbsp;it up and put it into the&nbsp;creek and then we entertained ourselves for an hour with a hoolahoop, and an imitation skip it... Then we left at 10:30... Traffic was&nbsp;terrible, got back at like 6:30.     Camping isn't worth the trip because of the unloading afterward (especially one day).&nbsp;And now I'm back in front of my computer typing this... Don't you just love me?&nbsp; &nbsp;

       I&nbsp;went to sleep at like 3 this morning and woke up about 10:30 and drifted in and out of sleep for an hour more before finally hauling myself out of bed. I thought nobody was home because I had checked Ryan's room, downstairs and in the garage, and if nobody was there, then nobody was home. And I opened the door to my parents bedroom and i found  my mother  sitting on the couch...     &nbsp;   My mother came back 3 days early...     &nbsp;   Turns out the trip went bad... The kids were going crazy and were disrespectful. They wouldn't listen to the chaperones... The first night nobody slept, stuff like that. Mom was telling me about someone peed in someone's water containers... And my mom got into a fight...     &nbsp;     My mother... go into... a FIGHT...       &nbsp;   Besides my confirmation class coming, a few older kids went as well... Kids I knew by face, but I didn't really  know  them... Apparently, my mom was going to do her laundry, and one of the kids yelled at her because she didn't want to do laudry and kept asking her why she didn't pack enough clothes... stuff like that. And it got into this really big thing... and her mother got REALLY mad at my mother. My mom kept telling her that she didn't have to do laundry, but she did and so she left to do it. My mother is a pretty calm person (when she wants to be... especially in situations like this. But her mom, who was friends with my mom actually, got so pissed off at her. (Mom said she was ready to attack her.) And, if you knew my mother, she would NEVER PURPOSFULLY do something like that...&nbsp;It was just all a misunderstanding that got WAY out of hand...   &nbsp;   Mom said it was mostly the older kids acting up,&nbsp;the 4 older girls in particular. She&nbsp;talked about how she danced with the kids (God knows how embaressed I would be if I was there...), and how&nbsp;Tommy kept dancing to this one song&nbsp;that always came up on the radio and how one kid got a migran and my mom masaged it away, and how they rooted for her when she was driving...     &nbsp;   But there were tears shed as well... I mean, drama drama drama... Even the youth leader was crying (and he's a guy... though I still question if he's gay or not) and my mom, and the girl, and the girls mom... and the 3 other girls just HATED my mom... over this argument about LAUNDRY???   &nbsp;   GROW UP!   &nbsp;   They were totally disrespecting her, and my mom was actually scared for her safety. So she left...   &nbsp;   She didn't say goodbye,&nbsp;she&nbsp;just packed up and left... And I know they're all probably thinking she went running with her tail between her legs, but my moms not like that.&nbsp;She couldn't take it anymore... she didn't have to&nbsp;put&nbsp;up&nbsp;with it. She said sorry thousands of times, but they wouldn't forgive her and gave her the cold&nbsp;shoulder or yelled at&nbsp;her.   &nbsp;   This is at a trip where they went to go HELP people BUILD A FENCE for a CHURCH in MEXICO who had been ROBBED&nbsp;TWICE... and all they can&nbsp;do is yell about LAUNDRY! WHAT THE HELL WOULD THE MEXICANS THINK! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING... The other ministry groups were offended at our group...   &nbsp;   If I was there... oh, I could have sorted it out...&nbsp;My mom's a home grown&nbsp;Filipina...&nbsp;Growing up&nbsp;in a military base with her father as principle and taught pilots how to fly and had a purple heart her life was STRICT discipline... Nothing like over here in America.&nbsp;And my mother was AFRIAD of&nbsp;her father... you couldn't disobey him...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I'd let out&nbsp;a slew of swear words right now, but I'm&nbsp;cutting back... I'm really pissed off at them and crap, but... what can you do.&nbsp;What's done is done...   &nbsp;   Oh, joy, can't wait to go to church when everybodies back... *groans* My mother might not care what people think about her, but I can't help it...&nbsp;And I can't imagine MY MOM getting along with&nbsp;Kayla Taylor,&nbsp;Cassandra&nbsp;Taylor, and Courtney Gee (freaken preps... omg,&nbsp;I can't imagine what the guys thought of her)... They supported her when Courtney's sister was about ready to kill my mom... I can't imagine her getting along with any of my confirmation classmates... Well, maybe AJ and Chris Vargas... People like that.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Pissed off&nbsp;is an understatement...     &nbsp;   I'm going to stop talking now...     &nbsp;    patty       &nbsp;  All the details didn't come out right as I said it... but it went something like that...

       Wow... Long time no anything... &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   I haven't done NADA for days... Ah,&nbsp;I feel so... fat. Especially because me and my brother finished one of those boxes of mint and chip ice cream from Safeway in two days...&nbsp;I mean,&nbsp;I could certainly eat the whole thing in one day if&nbsp;I really wanted to... But&nbsp;I wasn't desperate to get fat..... It just sorta... happened (the eating of the ice cream)...      &nbsp;   I love it when it's just dad at home. Mom's so strict and stuff and dad's all laxed and stuff... like&nbsp;I can't STAND the way my mom asks me to do anything (like the LAUNDRY!), but when dad asks i do it... Ooh, what's the word. I'm electra complex... It's the unconcious tendency of a daughter to be attatched to her father and hostile toward her mother... LOL. Found that when&nbsp;I was looking up the  exact  definition for impassive. ( Because there's 4 other words like it, apathetic, stoic, stolid, and phlegmatic... how did i find electra complex again?) It's like when we went to the Philippines... Mom didn't come, it was a week of heaven... I swear.    What else shall I rant about? I think nothing that should go up here anyways... *smirks*     Okay, I'll go back to being my boring self again.     &nbsp;   ta     Patty        QUESTA NOTTE  PASSERA!

      okay... i don't think i'll be able to update for the rest of the month. same goes for writing.  i know... again with the 2 months thing... but it's just not coming to me. hopefully, i will be able to do something while in san diego or las vegas because alaska is going to be HELL...  along with packing 2 bags per person on a camping trip, we will be arriving late at night in which we will rent a car and drive straight to our site. so basically, we stock up on CAFFINEE! basically, we don't sleep the first night.  had to stop by b&n to pick up my last summer reading book and some other books to occupy me while on the plane and stuff...  theres nothing to write about. you guys know the rest.  don't know if you can call me while i'm in alaska, i think i'll be roaming. las vegas and san diego are ok though....  there are still a bajillion things i have to do, and i'm stuck on my book and everything's choas right now. (and this post is really rushed...)  so have a nice end of the summer and good luck with school!   patty

        Okay, so the rest of this week is my only time to relax before school beings (literally)  Thursday, we’re flying to Anchorage to do some camping up there (sun‘s up 16 hours a day! O__O)… Then we fly back like the 17th… Maze day is on the 18, probably flying out THAT NIGHT to San Diego (BOGGIE BOARDING! I haven’t gone in so long…) or Las Vegas. We have to go to an OSH ROBAN concert on the 21st and catch a flight back on the 22st or else end up driving all the way back home so we can get to school on the 23rd.  Yep… I KNOW!  No time to rest at all. Still need to get my last beyond book (and finish reading F451). Talk about crazy. And we were thinking about going to Europe… Jeezuz….  I am dreading school. Mom and Dad are going to have to give me Benadril just so I’ll go to sleep the night before. Which reminds me. Lately, I haven’t been able to sleep very soundly… Insomnia? Stress? I dunno. I mean… it’s too early for me to start stressing out about school (even for me).  For example, last night. I woke up every hour (after having very odd dreams… And I normally don’t have dreams… So why am I starting to have dreams now?). Mom woke me up at 8 telling me they were going to have breakfast at Antie Joy’s. Then dad comes in at 10 and says he’s leaving for my Aunts house. So I wake up every hour as usual and finally get out of bed at 1 something. Go on the computer, call Gina… Mom and dad come pick me up half and hour later to have lunch at my Aunt’s house. The Lilliputians left, they’re heading to David’s house.  And tomorrow, we have to go to a funeral. My Uncle whose been sick for a while finally died. Ryan’s still really uncomfortable with death. He’s still really emotional from Mr. Alfalma. So going up to Sacramento tomorrow…  And that’s my life so far. It’s been crazy and it’s only going to get crazier.  Where did summer go?

        You cannot believe how much I’ve eaten today…  Today’s been one of those weird days where I’m happy in the morning and then I want to kill everybody by dinner time. (STUPID HORMONES!)  Now I’m going to tell you everything I ate today! ^__^ Wow… I hoped you looked in the mirror after reading that… Well, woke up early this morning. I had some of the steak from last night and some rice. Oh, and I found this bottle of wine with the screw on caps. So after filling a wine glass a little less then half and taking a couple of sips I felt guilty. So, I drained the rest in orange juice (Tasted pretty good, but I could hear Ryan moving upstairs and I was afraid he’d ask what I was drinking… It was a kind of purplish color). Okay… so then I started to feel REALLY guilty, so I dumped out the wine and drank regular orange juice while watching Maury. (LOL! OPPOSITES! So funny…) Oh yeah, and I had some jello… but it was kinda watery so I dumped it (nasty stuff when runny).  I don’t think I remember eating anything more until Dad got home. I had 2 cups of ice cream (see earlier posts at Princess Sabby and Princess Patty’s blog) and some ADOBO! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! (in that order) Then I had an apple. And then mom and dad went walking, so my brother and I finished the ‘grashopper’ ice cream thing (like mint and chips), then I went on to the sherbet (I ate a pretty decent amount).  Depressed? Maybe… I dunno.  And now… when I went downstairs to eat last it was because I was depressed (the whole can‘t write thing). So after getting upset because I couldn’t find anything I wanted to eat in the fridge, I made myself a quesadea. And then it was bland, so I needed something sweet. So I covered it in sour cream. But I was still craving something sweet so I pulled out some yogurt and the last piece of pecan pie. Fortunately, the yogurt did filled my craving and I spared myself a piece of pie (I don’t even like pecan pie).  Ack… and that’s just one day in my life. Now imagine my whole summer! It’s either I eat excessively, or hardly anything.  I’m weird like that.   NO GADDAMIT! I AM NOT PREGNANT! I'M ONLY 15 YOU RETARDS!

        Okay... Maybe I've been having trouble expressing myself lately or something because I am totally uninspired.  Been stuck on S/AWNM for a year now... And not only have I gotten ZLICH response (mostly this past summer) but I've been working my ass of (most of the time) on it.  I remember I had that 2 month gap and it very much killed my story to the point where I don't have anymore readers.  And now every time it takes me a while to write, I start to get panicky about not writing... Because then people forget. And even if they do come across it again, they aren't interested.   God, am I paranoid or what?  My whole stupid summer has been revolving around this. And what have I done? Like what... 3 chapters? 2 FRIGGEN MONTHS!!!  I actually wanted it finished by the end of this summer... but I haven't. No where close... instead I keep expanding. I keep adding and adding and now the whole friggen thing has become just a very complex overly used jumble of hate driven revenge.  Is that right?  Well, she doesn't HATE her father... Does she?   God, even I don't know. Now what does that tell people?  That I'm a horrible writer that can't even write a friggen plot? I have NO idea where this is going. I'm just writing on spur of the moment... I have to just sit down and think up a plot instead of just letting it flow.   KILLING ME!  I think it's because- well... I'm writing about when she goes to the DEC meeting. And you'd expect MM to... what? Would be let this kind of thing slide? Or would he rant and rave? Or maybe he'd rant and rave but let it slide... Maybe he'd be happy? I don't even know the friggen character. He's as much of a mystery to me, the author, as he is to the reader.  I'm probably giving it away.     Okay... that's me ranting. I think i'll go give myself a paper cut now.   Patty

I present to you, the Liliputians!     My newest cousin, Isabelle (but I'm not exactly sure how to spell her name... She might spell it with a 'z')      Jennifer, Noah, and Josh (what's ironic is that jen if white/flip. noah is mexican/flip. and josh is chinese/flip. LOL!)      Josh     Aaron     ISABELLES SANDALS! SO CUTE! They're smaller than my hands!  And, I just had to add... When us older generation, was their age... maybe younger   LOL! That's David, Me, and Ryan.

       Hey errybody... Long time no type here... The liliputians are over again...  OMG! Okay... Chee was saying something about  urlLink fictionpress.com  the other night... I had actually been thinking about posting some school work up there lately. So I did...  AND I GOT A REVIEW! MWAHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAH! Happiness... ^__^  Not going to tell you what I posted because I know you'd all poke fun of me if I did... Trying to keep my identity secret for right now. Though, if you tried hard enough, you could probably guess my pen name.   Um... stuck on chapter 13 for AWMN... absolutly POSITIVLY KILLING ME! I've been uninspired for the past week.  K-I-L-L-I-N-G ME!  Okay, now that I've all just revealed my little writting thing to you, I'm going to hide in embaressment.   I WANT CHOCOLATE! patty

       Okay... so the party didn't go too well.  My brother and I were the older kids there (pretty pathetic I know...). About half way through the swimming and stuff there was an... err... accident.  My little cousin suddenly had the urge to go in the pool... and no, not turn the water yellow. Thankfully, I had decided that I didn't want to go swimming because I went swimming 2 days before with my other cousins.  It was pretty damn boring.  So now, they're all over at my house (the liliputians). Ryan's got them hooked with the GC right now.  (*thinking: camera...*)   I've eaten SO much today, I'm feeling pretty blah just sitting at my computer. (And come on, what was I supposed to do for like 4 hours with all these kids running around giggling like theyre drunk?)  (*thinking: hmm... that would have been a good idea*)    I haven't been able to write for a while, and it's KILLING ME. And I've only gotten 3 reviews... one from a former reader. YAY! (conincidently, the person's pen name's 'faithful'... but it's the first time I've heard from the person in several months...)  Oh, did I tell you [people] that ryan got kicked off/banned from ff.net?  (*LITTERALLY FALLS OVER LAUGHING*)  He didn't follow guidelines or something or other. Thought that was HALARIOUS!  Qué más?   Omg, Jennifer is driving me insane. She's in that giggly barbie stage thing... she's the ultimate girly girl. You know... pink night dresses with those fake plastic dress up shoes and her room's covered in purple and she's got all this make up already... The damn girl is seven. Jeez, and I don't even wear make up... Who the hell is SHE trying to impress? Kinda makes me wanna chuck her through the window.  I can hear them fawning over Isabelle downstairs. I better go check it out. (Mom does this weird Filipino thing like Mz. Welsh used to do...  *cringes*  Mz. Welsh makes it popular while my mother makes it sickening...)  Later,  Patty

        Wow… long time no type. Mostly because when I wanted to type something, my computer got all skrewed up and by then I was to pissed off to re-type everything.  Okay, so on friday I hung out with katlin and I went home and ate dinner. Then my parents tell me they're going to las vegas tomorrow morning and the flights looked bad for tomorrow night and my mom wasn't really comfortable with the idea of leaving us alone at the house over night so we had 30 minutes to pack so we could stay over at john and jackies for 2 nights.  Really wanted to strangle them just then.  So we go... and I'm stuck with Ryan and John because Jackie had gone to sacramento early. So I kinda do nothing, go to sleep... do somemore nothing until Jackie and Nikki come. And then they decided they want to go swimming. So after swimming us girls watch  Havanan Nights  and watch Diego Luna. (dammit gina, one week was all it took and now i'm starting to sound like her.)  So Nikki and Jackie took over my room and I only got 5 hours of sleep. Went to church the next morning, boring... They decided they wanted to go swimming again. Mom and dad came and I was running back and forth from the pool to the house (it was way too cold to swim). Had an awsome meal full of lovely calories.  Went home, went on my computer... and you know the rest.   Today, Auntie Cathy and (i think) Uncle Pete are coming over from San Diego for dinner, and Jennifer is coming. Jennifer's birthday party is tomorrow at Green Hills. Agg, stupid country club won't let me wear jeans. SKREW THE COUNTRY CLUB! And I have to go other wise it would be impolite especially because we live like 5 minutes away and they know we aren't doing anything (just my and my brother because my parents are working).  Um, so now I'm hiding in my room because my mom is making us clean up the house. Ya... fun. (no, I don't feel like cleaning today!)  thats all  patty
