       Happy becoz i have jus completed 6 difficult mission of LOTR the game within 3 days. Can u believe it?????for some of u maybe can be earlier but the game is difficult. Anyway it is lame....But i feel a sense of achievement in completeing it as it allows me to vent anger(kick some orcs ass up) damn nice...  Bad ah becoz of a guy(dont wan to mention him), i am veri disappointed wif him and surprised by his sudden change in behaviour. He was not like this earlier on but went to a complete change, haizz jus broke up wif him....  Class matter:  Tomorrow mus bring HE...sian....mus do cooking for the rest of the year liao...... Today house games were boring, i didnt feel like taking part in soccer, jus stand down there and be cheerleader lor... I wonder whether alex or johnathan will get student leader????Compeitition?????Veri anxious to noe the result...  Got to go to sleep, tomorrow skool liao....
