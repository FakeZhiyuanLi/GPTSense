      Ok, so over the past few days I have been reading about the mass destruction that is going to happen to Jerusalem and Judah, and a couple of times I have commented that God is being just in what he says he is going to do.  I think maybe I should explain.  It's like this: Yes, God was going to lay the people to waste, but it is not like he was like, "Ok, well you screwed up once, bring on the pain!", it was more like, "You messed up, I will hold back my wrath for now" (repeat a jillion times), then "I stood it before but I can't stands no more!".  I mean, God was slow to anger, and he is in a lot of cases in the bible where I think people have used as examples against God as being a hot head.  God gave people simple instructions, and they didn't follow them:    23 This is what the LORD says:   " Let not  the wise man boast of his wisdom  or the strong man boast of his strength  or the rich man boast of his riches,  24  but let him who boasts boast about this:  that he understands and knows me ,  that I am the LORD ,  who exercises kindness,  justice and righteousness on earth,  for in these I delight ,"  declares the LORD .  - Jeremiah 9:23-24    Idols are a funny thing, because most all people have them, however we do not consider them to be idols and do not even recognize the power (or lack there of) they have over our lives.  I love this:    5 Like a scarecrow in a melon patch,  their idols cannot speak;  they must be carried  because they cannot walk.  Do not fear them;  they can do no harm  nor can they do any good."   - Jeremiah 10:5    Lastly, this was Jeremiah's prayer and I see it fitting that it should be mine as well:    23 I know, O LORD , that a man's life is not his own;  it is not for man to direct his steps.  24 Correct me, LORD , but only with justice-  not in your anger,  lest you reduce me to nothing.   - Jeremiah 10:23-24

      Man, the israelites sure screwed it all up.  I mean, these guys were seriously messed up, maybe even more than us, I don't know.  God lets them know what's up:    21 " 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! 22 For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 23 but I gave them this command:  Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people.  Walk in all the ways I command you, that it may go well with you. 24 But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the  stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts.  They went backward and not forward.  - Jeremiah 7:21-24    I like seeing God in this way, because it shows that he is just.    God is not a pushover  ...enter the Valley of the Slaughter.  Sounds kind of shocking, but I think that is what the people needed to hear.  They were so far down in their sin that they needed a wake up call:    30 " 'The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD . They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have  defiled  it. 31 They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire-something I did not command,  nor did it enter my mind.  32 So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD , when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the  Valley of Slaughter , for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.  - Jeremiah 7:30-32

      Wow, today's reading was astounding.  I am glad that I am reading this stuff because I have read most of the new testament, but there is ALOT of the Bible that I haven't read and some of this stuff is not only insightful, but also very poetic.  Jeremiah recieved word from God that some major smack was to be laid down on Jerusalem and the rest of the people who were defying God.  I don't want to take up to much of this post, because there were some good quotes, here they are:  This one talks about how the people have spoken lies against the Lord, and how he will empower Jeremiah to speak against them:    12 They have lied about the LORD ; they said, "He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine. 13 The prophets are but wind and  the word is not in them ; so let what they say be done to them."   14 Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty says:   "Because the people have spoken these words,  I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes.   - Jeremiah 5:12-14    So many times people look at the Bible and think, "How could [insert your favorite "mess-up" person or group here] do something like that?".  This next one makes me wonder if people will be inserting us into that sentence in the future and it had a good question as well:    31 The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority,  and my people love it this way .  But what will you do in the end?   - Jeremiah 5:31    This last one I like simply because Jeremiah is showing his passion for what God wants and his righteous anger towards the attrocities of God's people (Jeremiah speaking):    10 To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed so they cannot hear.  The word of the LORD is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it. 11  But I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in.    - Jeremiah 6:10-11

      Sometimes I think people get confused when they read things where God is angry with man.  They think, "I thought God loved everyone?", or "How could God do such a terrible thing?".  The reality of it is that although God loves everyone, he is not a push over.  Just as with every action there is a reaction, with every trespass there is a punishment.  If God had never made an example out of people, no one would have ever learned anything and God would not be just because he would be allowing attrocities to be committed without any form of retribution.  Jeremiah talks about how God's people have turned away from him and worshipped false idols of wood and stone.  They have become like prostitutes, offering themselves to many gods (although he may be referring to some physical issue, the point of the message is talking about spiritual prostitution).  Here is a snippet from what I read today:    7 A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant. 8 So put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us.  - Jeremiah 4:7-8

      So my wife and I went to church tonight, like every Tuesday night, because we are high school mentors.  Tonight's topic was Satan and I think that a lot of good things were presented and the kids hopefully learned alot from it.  In my small group we had a good discussion about Satan, and the power he has in our lives.  Even more interesting was talking about the spiritual warfare of the future.  The kids were involved and talking about the topic, and that is a lot to say because I have all freshmen and they have a hard time staying focused =P.  So today was a good day and I look forward to what challenges and blessings God has in store for me tommorrow.

      I am going to try and read from the bible each day, not only so that I can learn, but also so that I don't forget to acknowledge God and all that he has done for me.  I am beginning with Jeremiah and I will probably post some significant verse(s) that I read that day.  So...    31 "You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD :   "Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, 'We are free to roam; we will come to you no more'? 32 Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments?  Yet my people have forgotten me,  days without number  .  - Jeremiah 2:31-32   This kind of stuck out to me because in our day and age we tend to "forget" about God, even as Christians, until it is an appointed time to meet him (i.e. church, bible study).  The reality is that we need to focus on him as often as we can throughout our days.  I am going to try and start doing this today.

      I am ready for some changes in my life.  I know that God will change me, and mold me if only I will let him.  I am going to use this blog as a journal of sorts to remind me of all of the challenges and blessings that I face in my everyday life.  Hopefully people who are reading this can share in my joy, and help to keep me from falling.

      Read the chapters here: urlLink 21  &  urlLink 22   So the people are under attack and what do they do?  Cry to Jeremiah:    1 The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said: 2 "Inquire now of the LORD for us because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us."   - Jeremiah 21:1-2    The people are thinking, ok... well... we have an enemy, so lets just have the Lord protect us.  They are coming to Jeremiah hoping he will tell them that God has said "I will save you my little bratty children.  It's ok that you are horrible and full of evil".  Unfortunately for them Jeremiah tells that that the Lord has said:    5 I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in anger and fury and great wrath.  - Jeremiah 21:5    Then God gives them some words of wisdom for the future:    " 'Administer justice every morning;  rescue from the hand of his oppressor  the one who has been robbed,  or my wrath will break out and burn like fire  because of the evil you have done-  burn with no one to quench it.  - Jeremiah 21:11

      Read the chapters here: urlLink 19  &  urlLink 20   Today's reading was pretty short, but I think that it was good none the less.  There is a song that we sing in the high school ministry that goes something like this:    Stir in me a  fire  that the world cannot explain I come to worship you  Stir in me a  passion  that my  heart  cannot contain I come to worship you   Hold me, break me Mold me and make me more and more like you  I come to worship you  To Love you, to fear you, draw ever near you as I worship you I come to worship you    I think some of this song may have been inspired by Jeremiah (perhaps not, but there are definitely some parallels):    9 But if I say, "I will not mention him  or speak any more in his name,"   his word is in my heart like a fire ,  a fire shut up in my bones.   I am weary of holding it in;   indeed,  I cannot .   -Jeremiah 20:9    Now granted, Jeremiah didn't seem to be in that happy of a mood when talking about how he was being sought after to be beaten and how he was despised, but it was a nice parallel anyways.

      Read the chapters here: urlLink 17  &  urlLink 18   God does not do things randomly.  Unlike us, God does all things with purpose in mind.  In the same way, God does not respond to us in random ways:    7 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, 8 and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.  - Jeremiah 18:7-8    It is also important that our hearts be changed, not just our actions, because God knows your motivations and your feelings:    9  The heart is deceitful  above all things  and beyond cure.  Who can understand it?   10 "I the LORD  search the heart   and  examine the mind ,  to reward a man according to his conduct,  according to what his deeds deserve."   - Jeremiah 17:9-10    Observing the above, it should be easy to see that the next statement is clearly true:    5 This is what the LORD says:   "Cursed is the one who trusts in man,  who depends on flesh for his strength  and whose heart turns away from the LORD.  - Jeremiah 17:5    If the heart is truly deceitful, then how can we depend upon our own strength?  The answer is we cannot!  We are prideful, arrogant, self serving people who seek not the glory of others (the Lord in particular), but glory for ourselves.  We are so self absorbed with how we are perceived by others, yet not as concerned with how we are perceived by the heavenly realm.  I am not exempt from this, but I am working to fight against my nature and put off the old self and put on the new self which is given to me by God.  It will be a long journey, but in the end I will be able to look back and be content with the life God had given me the option of pursuing.

      Read the chapters here: urlLink 15  &  urlLink 16   So, it seems as though Jeremiah is going to be entirely about the destruction of God's people.  Although it sometimes seems repetitive, there is usually something to extrapolate from it.  As I said in the last reading, God was pushed to the point of not being able to relent.  I mentioned how in the past Moses had talked with God on the people's behalf and how God had decided to turn his anger away from his people.  It is funny that I mentioned that because chapter 15 starts with the following:    1 Then the LORD said to me: "Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!  - Jeremiah 15:1    Good stuff, way to back me up on that God =Þ.  I have mentioned this before, but I think that alot of times people don't understand that God is not a doormat.  Yes, he forgives people for the things we have done, and the times now are much different since Jesus has already come and paid for all of the sins of the world(Hallelujah!), but it doesn't mean that he is going to just sit back and idly watch as his people mock him and do horrible things that do not only deny God his glory, but don't even give glory to themselves!  I mean, if God was out to get these people, it was for a good reason.  God isn't like, "Oh, you forgot to go to temple today? ZaaapPPPp!!!".  If you read the text it shows that God was patient, but he was not going to wait forever for his people to change.    6 You have rejected me," declares the LORD .  "You   keep on backsliding  .  So I will lay hands on you and destroy you;  I can   no longer show compassion  .  -Jeremiah 15:6    A hard lesson to learn is that if you won't change something God wants you to, he will alot of times put you in situations that will get the ball rolling for change.    21 "Therefore I will teach them-  this time I will teach them   my power and might .  Then they will know  that my name is the LORD .   - Jeremiah 16: 21    Good stuff!

      There were times in the old testament when God was about to punish his people, but someone intervened on their behalf (ex: Moses).  In this instance, God has had all he can take and it appears as though he has no intention of canceling the onslaught.  From the things he describes (and I am sure this is a watered down, minimized version of the whole situation), it seems as though the people have gone completely off the path God set before them:   Exhibit A:    27 your adulteries and lustful neighings,  your shameless prostitution!   I have seen  your detestable acts  on the hills and in the fields.  - Jeremiah 13:27    I bolded the "I have seen" for a reason, and that is to emphasize that even though so many times we think we are getting away with things because no one else sees, God still sees.  As Pillar so elequently put it in "Behind Closed Doors", a song about what you do behind closed doors, "so whats the point in even trying to hide, cuz everything you do is seen by omnipotent eyes".   Exhibit B:    14 Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds.  - Jeremiah 14:14    Makes you wonder why God doesn't punish us more, because I am sure that we have to be at least on par with these people.  One could argue though that God is punishing us in other ways, but who really knows for sure.

      Chapter 11 talked about the convenant God had with his people and how they had broken it.  When reading about it, it seems strange that they would turn away from God considering how represented his presence was back then, but then you realize that people are sinful, and look at your own life and think, "man, I am not much different than them!".  In chapter 12 the following quote shows how even though God was punishing, he was doing it in search of repentance:    14 This is what the LORD says: "As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them. 15 But after I uproot them,  I will again have compassion  and will bring each of them back to his own inheritance and his own country. 16 And  if  they learn well the ways of my people and swear by  my name , saying, 'As surely as the LORD lives'-even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal-then they will be established among my people. 17 But  if  any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and  destroy  it," declares the LORD .  -Jeremiah 12:14-17

      I am going to switch over to the study we are doing in our bible study.  Some questions will come up and I will write them here for my own memory.   Daniel 5  I think it is funny how most people seem to hide behind the excuse of ignorance. "I didn't know it was wrong" or some similiar phrase when they should have know by example.  I do it to, and even worse, we do things even though we know they are wrong. Belshezzar knew how he was acting was wrong, Daniel points this out:    22 "But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself,  though you knew all this . - Daniel 5:22    Question:  Why don't the examples we see in our own lives and in others stop us from doing wrong?    Daniel 6  Daniel's talents and faithfulness in God are so great that he has even got the new king believing:    20 When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel,  servant of the living God , has your God,  whom you serve continually , been able to rescue you from the lions?" - Daniel 6:20    Man, not only does the king acknowledge the living God, but he also can see just how important God is by Daniel's faithfulness to serve!  Question:  Do I continually serve? What can I do to improve this?

          I am going to start using this website again, hopefully every day. The icon at the top of the post will serve as a reminder to myself how I feel I was that day with respect to my walk with God. The image on the right is Holy and symbolizes my being a warrior for God. The image on the left is my second nature (or perhaps more accurately my first!) which represents the sinful side of me that I allow to come out from time to time. The goal is to see nothing but good images. At the very least I will post to display which image I feel I am for the day. We'll see how it goes.
