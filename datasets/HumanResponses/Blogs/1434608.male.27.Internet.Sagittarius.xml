      The other night I was being lazy and watching a little of the Food TV channel and managed to catch Emeril Live. I used to watch this show almost everyday about three years ago, but lost interest for various reasons. Anyway this night Emeril did a whole show on Summer Squash and had one recipe for a cold soup. Well seeing as I am eating just about everything cold now, cause I live in the Sun's Valley, I was very interested.   I have this strange ability to watch someone make something once and be able to pretty well replicate what they have done. So I took a few of the things that Emeril did and made it into something of my own. I hope you enjoy, and please experiment.   Ingredients:  8 Tbsp Unsalted Butter 3 Medium Yellow Onions - Diced 5 Cloves Garlic - Minced 6 Tsp Kosher Salt 4 Tsp Black Pepper 3 Tsp Red Curry 3 Tsp Cumin 2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper 1 Tsp Ginger 4 lbs Summer Squash - 1 inch cubes 6 Cups Chicken Broth (I use the instant stuff) 1 Cucumber 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar 1 Bunch Cilantro   Directions:  In large pot melt butter, add onion and simmer a minute or so. Add garlic and spices let simmer another minute or three. Add Squash and simmer another 5 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling turn to low and let simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Use hand blender to puree to desired texture (I like mine fairly smooth but with a few chunks to make it interesting. Place into Ice Bath and into refrigerator to chill.   Garnish:  De-Seed cucumbers and slice very thin. Place into bowl with Vinegar and a cup of water. Let soak for a few hours and pour out remaining water/vinegar mixture (This is something I picked up when I was a Sushi Chef. Chop Cilantro to various sizes.   Serve:  Serve chilled with an array of cucumber slices in a wheel with cilantro sprinkled on top.  Excellent as appetizer for almost any entree. I also like to have some Tortillas around for dipping.

      What a fitting first post for my new blog on eating. For any of you who don't know me, I have this strange relationship with Coffee. On one hand I love her like a fair maiden of a magical wasteland, and on the other I despise the grip that she has on me and how I feel when trying to get away. I absolutely adore the flavor and aroma of even a cheap brew, but my synapses go into conniptions when a real class brew is served. There is no equivalent for flavor or effect: Coffee is my drug of choice.   This will be a multi-part series broken into chapters to convey my miniscule amount of knowledge concerning the buying, storing, brewing, and of course consuming a great cup of Joe. Along the way I will indulge you in my education of this mystical substance which is thought to have been discovered in 800BC.   Chapter 1: The Shop - Storage and Grinding  I grew up in the incredible town of Vail, Colorado. If you haven't heard of it I applaud you for being able to hide from popular culture for the last three decades. While I grew up there, skiing and hiking, my mother owned the greatest deli store of all time: The Cheese Shop of Vail (namesake of this Blog).   Well besides selling what many consider to still be the greatest sandwiches ever created on the face of the planet and having a ridiculous collection of cheeses, my mother sold an array of Coffee. The primary roaster that I recall was Allegro Coffee, based in Boulder Colorado and whom has since been purchased by either Safeway or King Soopers, and this is where my Coffee education began.  She had this huge structure of plastic bins that each held at least ten to twenty pounds of Coffee, much like what you see in the Super Markets today. Flavors ranged from French Roast to Kenya to Hazelnut and so on and so forth. I learned that storage of the beans was simple: Once you open it from the sealed bags you need to get it into a sealed container ASAP. I remember clearly messing up one time and filling the bin to its top and my mother getting so red in the face I was worried she might burst into flame and then set me alight.  Once she came back down from boiling, and had me go sweep the parking lot. She explained that when the beans are out in the open they start going stale and it left out too long will not be any good to the customers. At that time I still didn't understand completely how making the customer happy had a direct effect on my life so she made it very clear: if the coffee isn't any good the lil' roger wont be getting any new toys for his birthday. A few years later I would learn that stale coffee was actually worse than not getting new toys, but this analogy definitely had its effect at the time.  Well I was first entranced by the seductress Ms. Hazelnut with her sweet and, what I later learned to be false, light aromatics. My parents were always against my drinking it as I was only six or seven, but I was in love. I would sneak cups of it around the store and, with heavy amounts of cream, partake in forbidden pleasure.   I learned how to grind the beans in the enormous european Burr grinder. I was fascinated with the mechanism involved: the trap door on top where the whole, and unsuspecting, beans were poured in, the gigantic adjustment knob on front where the size of the grind was determined, and the long black handle on front which served to clamp the bag in place during grind and later employed as a knocking mechanism to clear all the grinds from the chute of the beast. It was my most prized toy.  I learned that the finer the grind the stronger the flavor. As my ability with the grinder and taste for coffee matured I could ask an uneducated patron how they liked their coffee and what it was to be used for, and then match the type of coffee with the appropriate level of grind. This resulted in a strong following for coffee from our store as no other vendor took the time and patience to make this happen.  By the time the Espresso machine arrived I was pretty much a coffee junky. I was eleven and the foreign machine held me entranced with its knobs and levers and gauges and size. I mean good lord it took four full grown men to get it into the store and onto the counter top. This quickly became my new favorite as it had its own grinders and steam nozzles for foaming the milk. I got to the point where I was making designs in the foam after pouring and this became yet another crowd pleaser.  As with all good things The Shop eventually came to an end and I was displaced from my second home. This was eventually replaced with another Coffee haven, but that is for another chapter...

      The concept of a cold soup always made my stomach turn when I was really young, so did onion and ham but those are both separate stories. At my mom's shop in the summer she always made up this really strange sounding soup, that was served COLD!?!?!? The Horror! The Horror! Then one day when I was forced to create the enormous five gallon tub of it I actually tried some and my eyes popped out of my skull. The variety of flavors involved was almost beyond comprehension,  but it was the temperature that allowed your brain and more importantly your tongue to adjust.  I had one of my first memorable moments of clarity: that food was so much more than something that made my stomach stop grumbling. Food was something that could amaze and bewilder as well as keep you alive, and this cold soup was the focal point for me.  The problem with my style of cooking is that I don't really measure anything, its all about assumption, guessing, and testing. However, since this blog is intended to teach you how to eat and cook better I will do my best.   Ingredients:  1 Large can of V8 (I like the Spicy but you can use regular) 8 Large red tomatoes 2 Cucumbers (Remove most of skin and all seeds) 3 Stalks of Celery 2 Zucchini 1/2 Medium Red Onion 1/2 Cup Parsley 1/2 Cup Cilantro 1/4 Cup Dry Oregano 1/4 Cup Dry Basil 1/4 Cup Honey (Yes Honey) 1/4 Cup Olive Oil 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt 1 Tbsp Black Pepper 1 Tbsp Tabasco sauce   Directions:  1) Dice all veggies as small as you can get them, place in large bowl 2) Add V8 and seasonings, taste and add seasonings accordingly 3) Chill at least 6 hours 4) Serve cold with Parsley garnish and French bread Options: Add various spices: Chili sauce, Cumin, Curry Blend in Food Processor or blender for a creamy soup.  The Honey and Tabasco are the key ingredients that my mother added to her Gazpacho. I experimented and added more of both and she freaked out, but when customers started coming in just for the Gazpacho she eased up. I started making a smaller batch with extra spice to it and this would sell just about as quickly as the regular stuff.

      Since I live on the Sun, or the valley of it anyway, I have to find cold things to eat during the summer months. Otherwise I will die, well that may be a bit melodramatic, but not by far. One dish that I really enjoy making and is super easy is my take on Pasta Salad.    Ingredients:  Two Boxes of  urlLink Bow Tie Pasta  1/2 Large Red Onion 1 Red Pepper 1 Green Pepper 1/2 Jar  urlLink Pepperoncini  2 Cans Black Olives 1 Cup Olive Oil 1 Cup Feta Cheese 1/2 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar 1/4 Cup Dry Oregano 1/4 Cup Dry Basil 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt 1 Tbsp Black Pepper   Garnish:  Fresh Chopped Spinach   Directions:  1) Boil Pasta 10 to 12 minutes until Al Dente, then strain into Ice bath to stop from over cooking 2) Dice up vegetables to your preference (sometimes I like them small so they blend with the pasta, other times I like them almost the same size as the noodles) and add to large bowl 3) Chop up the Pepperoncini and add 4) Add pasta and begin stirring 5) Add Oil, Vinegar, Herbs and Cheese 6) Taste for seasoning 7) Chill for half an hour or so 8) Serve alone or with Grilled Chicken or Fish, Garnish with Fresh Spinach when serving to avoid sogginess.  This dish is super cheap and nutritious. If you are watching your pocket book even closer cut out the Feta, it will still taste great. Also remember to have fun when making this. If you are like me and like the kick the red onion gives it then put more in. Add some asian chili sauce if you want some warmth to it.

      If you dont know what a  urlLink Site Feed  is dont worry, just read read this.    There is a new way of reading web sites, well it aint that new but its just now catching on in a big way. A Site Feed is a special part of a website that can be read by special programs or websites to give you, the reader, a condensed list of whats new on that site. That in itself is pretty boring, the cool part is the program or website that you use to read these Feeds. They are called  urlLink Aggregators  which is a really ugly word for 'a place to organize Site Feeds for viewing'.    Aggregators  There are many  of these Aggregators to choose from but the decision has been made real simple since last years(2003) introduction of  urlLink Bloglines.com . You may have noticed the ' urlLink Subscription Stuff'  on the left side of this site. Well that little box 'subBloglines' is Simple Tech's site feed, but its better because rather than having to worry about how to set up a Site Feed you just click on that button.     Before you click there let me tell you whats going to happen. You will be taken to the BlogLines website and given the chance to Log In or Register a new account. If you are reading this article that means you probably have to Register a new account. Once you do that Bloglines will set you up with a Site Feed to Simply Tech. You can then search for other sites to get feeds from or choose from a multitude of lists that Bloglines recommends.    Just about every website has or is implementing this feature. Even the  urlLink New York Times  has finally gotten onto the bandwagon.    Click on the subBloglines button, or just  urlLink click here .

      Please take  urlLink this article  to heart. It is time for you to stop using Internet Explorer, the default web browser for your Windows machine. It is a major security risk. You will pretty much eliminate 80% of all Virus threats by switching to another  urlLink browser .    I personally use  urlLink Firefox  from the  urlLink Mozilla group .     urlLink Here is a great article on switching from Internet Explorer to Firefox.     Don't be afraid. Click on one of the Above links, download the software, restart your machine, and don't look back.   urlLink

      One really difficult aspect of the Internet is how unorganized and spread out it is. If you want to really participate with the Internet you need to learn how to set bookmarks up.      Process:        Goto a website that you use frequently or would like to use Frequently.     At the top of the Screen Click on the Tab Bookmarks and choose Add Bookmark.     You will then be presented with a Dialogue Box (Window) that has the Title of the website and a couple of folders. You can click on the folders to place the Bookmark into one. You can also create your own folders by clicking on the New Folder button.     Play with the Bookmark feature, especially with organizing your Bookmarks. You will find that your Internet usage will be more focused and useful.

      Anyone who is using a PC with Windows on it, and this is the majority of you, needs to be going to the  urlLink Windows Update  site just about once a week. I cannot understate the necessity of doing this enough.     Reasons:   The main reason for doing this is to download any security patches that Microsoft has released. You do not need to know anything about what the patches do, just make sure that you get them.     Process:        Go to  urlLink www.windowsupdate.com  and let the site run its scan on your system. Just click on that link to get there.       Once the scan is done you will be given a list of updates that your machine needs. You will want to choose all of the Critical Updates. There will also be a list of Recommended Updates which you can choose to download or not.     If you are on a Dial Up connection be prepared to wait a while, especially if you have never done one of these updates.

      I worked for a recruiter a little bit after I graduated from University. It was a friend of my cousin's, whom I had moved in with to escape Colorado, and he really needed help with his website and internal network. So i jumped on board with what turned out to be one of the most bizarre and educational jobs I have ever had.   The whole premise with a recruiter is that they can find an employee that is a better fit for your company than you can find. It is a huge industry to be in with loads of money being made by the recruiter. The problem I have with it is that it is a form of laziness on the employer's part. Not only does it mean you are too lazy to find the next superstar employee, but your reputation in the industry is not very good or else the superstars would be finding you.  The same thing happens in the Advertising world with Ad Brokers. What happens is that a small time publication doesn't want to focus on the business aspects of actually making any money and instead just hires a Broker to take care of the ads for them. The Broker then skims some off the top and makes a nice bit of coin.  The problem for the publisher is that you now have a 3rd party representing you and your publication for a critical aspect of your business: paying the bills! The problem for the advertiser is that they are dealing with someone that probably doesn't know much about your audience and therefore doesn't know much about the product that the ads will be for.  Then comes the really fun part: billing models. In the print world this is not such a big deal, but online you have many different models: CPM, Flat, CPC, and CPA. As a publisher you want CPM or Flat as this assures that you get paid. As an advertiser you want (or should want) CPA as this assures that you are getting the business that you pay for. The problem when a broker is involved is that the publisher will give them CPM rates to follow and then some crazy math has to start up if a CPC deal is to be negotiated. To say the least it makes the situation very confusing.  I personally do not like dealing with brokers because they are after one thing: making themselves as much money as possible. This does not help me as either an publisher or an advertiser in the long run. As a publisher I end up getting ads that don't match the content of my site and are sporadic. As an advertiser I get these Frankenstein deals and have to constantly watch my numbers to make sure I am getting something out of the deal.  Bottom line: if you are going to be in the business where Ads are an important part of your revenue you need to handle it yourself.

      I once had a job doing  urlLink door to door sales  of office supplies. It was full commission, I only got paid on the first purchase and it sucked. I did manage to learn a lot about business, myself, and the street system of greater Phoenix.   One of the main things I learned from this was how inefficient it was. The company that I was selling for had guidelines about the size of office I could and could not sell to. So a lot of my time was spent figuring out that a business didn't qualify. This was my first lesson in advertising and marketing, well first among many, but it fits into this column well.  I witnessed first hand how much more efficient it was to put together a targeted advertising campaign. With advertising you can print up a few thousand catalogs or flyers and send them to businesses that you want to sell to (this is why the yellow pages are there). The problem is that advertisers spend too much time thinking about selling their product, and not enough selling their product to someone.  Example: I sell three panel 14 pt legal folders.   As an advertiser I am thinking about how many of these I need to sell at such and such a price in order to make a profit. It is strictly numbers to me because I have never even met my buyers. I focus my ads on price and how great my price is. Problem with this is what all salespeople already know "People don't buy on price". You can have the cheapest folders in the world but if I don't know what I want them for then why would I buy them, even if they are the 'cheapest'.  As a salesperson I am thinking inside of my buyers head, which is easier for me because I am already talking to them. I am thinking of the various places that need those types of folders, and when I do I realize that there aren't that many. I am going to focus primarily on lawyers offices, and mortgage and title companies. Then I am going to focus on a problem they all have: folders that tear at the seam. Now I have my audience and I have my bait. I put together an ad with the bait right up front and juicy and the I toss my line into the lake that wants that bait.  Only problem now is I need a bigger insides sales office to handle all the calls, or I can get a website to handle it, but all that is for a different blog...  This leads me into ' urlLink commodification ' and the travesty of a sinkhole that that mindset can put you into.

      Ahh what a great Tuesday! The new theme I am working on is brining Advertising and PR together. This is a challenge against the norm because these are seen as totally seperate worlds. The problem with that is the internet inherently brings these together.    So my tale of surviving and thriving in the advertising world begins: Winners are not placed on the pedestal and their way is not the easy way. In advertising the winners are the ones who's efforts lead to sales or actions of some form. The trouble today is finding that road less travelled and taking advantage of it before everyone else sees where you have gone and quickly follows.  One of the best ways to take the road less travelled, or even better create your own path, is by having a press release(PR). PR is a ribbon cutting, the first strike of the soil with the ceremonial shovel, the smashing of the bottle against the hull, and so on. The press release creates a one time eventness[sic] that sticks in people's minds. They witness the announcement of your new product and feel a sense of pride in knowing it just after you decided to tell the world about it.  This is so much more effective than reading a three sentence banner with some cute graphics. As Maxine Clayton puts it in  urlLink What Comes First: Ads or PR? :  ...PR gives a product or brand credibility or engrains the brand's worth into the brains of consumers, while advertising further reinforces that credibility, Ries said. A company should put in the nail (PR), then take the hammer (advertising) to drive in the message.   PR is so easy to: Just write up a few paragraphs about your new product, opening, announcement, etc and then tie it up with a blurb about the companies/organizations involved. Then find about twenty websites and publications to send the announcement to.   Be sure to let the publications know that you are interested in advertising there as well and you are almost guaranteed a spot for your release. Going with the ads is optional but it doesn't hurt to have one near the release. This also helps get future releases covered with little hesitation on the editor's part.  The most important thing is that you realize Advertising/PR/Marketing/Sales is all part of the business process and the more you can enjoy it the more successful you will be.

      "Change is the only constant" is one of the most overused and under practiced phrase in the English language. So I am using it as little as possible and trying to follow it as best I can. The latest example of this is the upgrading of  urlLink DesertStandard.com  to a new  urlLink CMS  system.   urlLink Blogger  is the  urlLink weblog  service that is owned and operated by Google, which comforts me that it will be around and running for sometime. The main reason for the upgrade is the amazing ease of use that Blogger gives me and the fact that it is compatible with  urlLink Ecto .  The main drawback is that I will have to manually update my posts, which is fine because the majority of my posts are inconsistent with any central theme. So now I am declaring a new central theme:  urlLink online advertising . Not that there arent enough Advertising and Marketing sites out there, but it is my chosen profession and the more I write about it perhaps the better I will get.  With the new system through Blogger expect more posts.

      Finally a very straight forward  urlLink article  on how to handle Google.  urlLink Wayne Hurlbert  hits the nail on the head in the excellent article over at  urlLink SEOchat.com .  The topic is Google's Backlink and  urlLink Pagerank  'Fever',  as Wayne puts it, and how too many webmasters focus on these seemingly magical numbers. I have many friends, both at work and outside, who try to talk to me about how they have a Pagerank of such and such and that they are linked from sites that have a Pagerank of such and such. I smile and congratulate them on a job well done and then I ask them what their sites are about and what that has to do with being linked to a site that talks about something completely different. Time and time again I get this slightly befuddled look, almost like the message is getting through, and then blam they get right back into their fevered pitch.   Reality is simple:   Google doesn't want you focusing on metrics to get better rankings. If this was the case then they may as well adopt a Pay for Inclusion model and at least make a penny off of it. What they want to do is provide the User, remember him/her thats the person you are trying to sell to, with the best possible result for what they are looking for.  Bear with me here as I am going to get real basic on it:    Scenario 1)   User X wants to find out about and maybe even by Product A. You sell Product B, which is close to Product A, but nevertheless is not Product A. You focus on Pagerank and Backlink till you are blue in the face and manage to get a great Google ranking, but for a keyword more related to Product B than A. Now you have a lot of visitors but none are buying because you are listed for something you do not offer.   Scenario 2)  User X is looking for Product B, which you happen to offer. You got a solid ranking for Product B by manipulating Pagerank and Backlink statistics. The problem is that you did not focus on making your site User Friendly and whenever they go to your site they get frustrated because they cannot find what they are looking for. If this happens often User X will stop using Google because all of its results are useless.   Scenario 3)  You spend hundreds of dollars, maybe more, to get a SEO 'expert' to get you a top position on Google. For a month or so you are sitting pretty. Then Google either changes its gameplan, they can do that because its their toy, or they decide that your site is abusing their toy. This results in your site dropping down the listings, or falling off the face of Google all together. Basically you just made some guy who knows very little about SEO a lot of money.   Bottom line:   Natural Search listings require time and patience as these are in a sense a barometer of the Internet. If your site is well built, has good content related to what you are trying to sell, and is usable by humans you will get listed in Google. If you are doing something outside of these parameters then you are trying to cheat Google, which you do at your own peril.

      Excellent post on  urlLink Small Business Ideas Forum  in regards to choosing and  urlLink Affiliate Program  by  urlLink Jonathan Kraft . Jonathan brings up some fairly common sense points about not only doing business with an Online Affiliate company, but with just about any company out there.    Keypoints:   -Number One is find something that you have a passion for.  -Number Two is to find a company that is honest and reputable.  These seem so sensible but you would be surprised how few people actually take these points into account when starting up an affiliate program. I am constantly hearing from clients who decided to start selling hosting because it is "such a fast growing market", but they don't know anything about setting up websites. Or I hear about people trying a program, putting down their hard earned cash and POOF nothing happens. So they decide to  urlLink Google  the company afterwards and find out that there are a few hundred others out there who fell into the same trap.

      Are you tired of keeping track of your bookmarks? Wish you could just save parts of what a website is talking about? How about organizing all of this into an  urlLink RSS  reader/ urlLink Blog /Search Engine/ urlLink Blogroll ? If you dont know what either of those last four items are I suggest clicking on them and getting some education. Otherwise read on...   Just over a year ago a new website came on the weblog scene and ever since has completely changed the game. This is of course the now infamous  urlLink Bloglines .   Background  Way back in July of 2003  urlLink Mark Fletcher , CEO of Bloglines, rolled out his take on capitalising on the RSS/webblog fever. While the service is still free to use we are getting hints that it will be turned into an advertising machine, and why not? What with email taking a continuous facedive and banner ads continuing to be non producers, the RSS platform is obviously the next frontier.  I have been using Bloglines since the start of 2004 when  urlLink Seth Godin  mentioned it in his blog. I was instantly hooked on its ease of use and incredible power. I have over  urlLink 100 site feeds  organized by various folders. I can scan through ten sites postings for the last twelve hours in about ten minutes. All the while I am 'clipping' or, new feature, blogging various articles to my Bloglines account for later review or use.   Email newsletters  If a site doesnt offer RSS I can create a Blogines email address and then Bloglines parses the email just like an RSS feed. Forget handing my email address out to unknown sites that might sell it to a SPAMMER. Now I use Bloglines and if the address gets abused I can just cancel it in seconds.   Blogroll  You will notice a few sections of links on the right hand side of this page. 'the DS Network', 'SEO', and 'Marketing' are all sites that I am subscribed to in Bloglines. The three groupings are simply folders that I have organized the sites into. Bloglines then creates a bit of Javascript that I place in my HTML and BOOM instant blogrolls. If I add or remove and sites from the folders the blogroll is instantly updated the next time my site is refreshed.  It will be interesting to see how they work out the advertising angle.

      I know that there is a bit of oversaturation with this Blog term but as far as I am concerned its better than my 'home page'. Anyway pretty cool  urlLink article  about this SEO contest that was put on for the last few months.  Pretty cool showing of what can be done with a well maintained blog.

      Seth Godin hits all the  urlLink right questions . What are you doing to distinquish yourself?  "So, how do we tell the good from the bad? In a connected world where people don't have letterhead, don't wear suits (don't even own suits) work out of tiny rented office suites (or their living room) have a simple website and buy only Adwords, have an answering machine not a PBX, don't have a receptionist or a sculpture out front in that world, how do we tell?"

      Today marks a fairly significant day in the  urlLink Blogosphere . One of the stalwarts of the culture,  urlLink Movabletype/Six Apart , has adjusted its top position. Mena Trott, one of the co-founders, has stepped down from the CEO position of this highly ingenious and influential organization. The move is sure to ruffle the feathers of many MovableType verterans as a sign that the company is further 'selling out', but this is what business is about. I think that Mena puts it best herself on her weblog:   "I'm a proud person, but not a foolish person. I'd rather be a part of a successful company that I co-founded and ran as CEO for a year than hold on to a title because of ego." urlLink Mena's Corner: Barak at Six Apart    This goes to show just how remarkable a company Six Apart truly is and should give an indicator of where they are going. Besides the MovableType CMS Software Six Apart also manages the  urlLink Typad.com  service which allows total newbies to set up their own webogs in a matter of minutes.

      In the daytime I am an Advertising Buyer for a Dot Com company. All of my buying is for online Ads on various websites. I am constantly taken aback when I keep hitting these sites that want to maintain this as a traditional advertising medium. By charging  urlLink CPM  and Flat Fee rates they are simply making themselves into Television on the Internet. As a buyer and a person I am turned away by these acts of irrationality and Greed.   Flat Fee's and CPM are a hold out from traditional Advertising where it is very difficult to track how many people are viewing an Ad and how many are then acting on that to make a purchase. Due to this uncertainty Publishers will charge a flat rate to their Advertiser and justify their rates with things like circulation numbers.  The same thing happens on the Internet. Publishers are able to see how many users are viewing their site each month and based on that charge accordingly. This is a lazy approach to business and offers almost no advantage over using traditional methods of advertising.  The very architecture of the Internet is TCP/IP which gives us unprecedented measuring techniques. Instead of guessing how many people are going to view an Ad we can actually tell how many not only looked at it but that it captured their attention enough to click on it. The next leap is tracking which of those clicks actually made a purchase and we can therefore get an exact ROI of our Advertising efforts.  The argument against this is that by just viewing the Ad users are getting a branding experience much like with Television and Print Advertising. This view is valid but with the recent rise in PVR's studies are showing that consumers are not interested in being Branded.  At my Offices we rarely consider Flat Fee or CPM deals because we are very  urlLink ROI  focused. Many companies still dismiss focusing on ROI for some strange reason, mostly laziness. This was also the trend about four years ago when everyone was Dot Com Crazy.

      Just got this from a buddies dad:                I just read an article stating that the American Lance Armstrong may be stripped of his 6th Tour de France title. In a random check for banned substances, 3 substances were found in Lance Armstrong's hotel that are banned by the French:   Toothpaste, deodorant, and soap...   Ohh now thats funny.

      Excellent  urlLink piece  on the erosion of trust that is leading to Blogs as a primary source of information.   "The popularity of blogging is due, in part, to a public distrust of the news media. A democracy like we have in the U.S. can't function properly if its citizens do not have the most accurate information they can get. If the right information doesn't find its way to the average citizen, the natural evolution of things moves us toward new media and mechanisms that can bring about accuracy, completeness of information, and most of all, trust.

      The big  urlLink buzz this week is that Microsoft has unleashed  its new Search Engine program. Too bad that Search is already conquered. What we are looking for is  urlLink Information Aggregation .  "MSN Newsbot, however, also remembers what you read (using browser cookies to track use instead of requiring you to sign in to Microsoft's Passport service) and presents stories it thinks might interest you in a special box. Moreover, it shows what other stories earlier readers of a news item clicked through to. "   Bloglines will rule the world. You heard it here.

      Very  urlLink interesting article  on the future of Information Valuation and how the Internet market will change in times to come.   "To realize the productivity potential of information technologies will require information valuation. By historical analogy, it is as if we are in the middle of the industrial revolution and we don't know the cost and price of steel. Today we sit in the midst of the information revolution and still don't know the value of the most fundamental resource that drives our global economy: information. The benefits of the information revolution won't be realized until bottom-up, market-based valuation of daily information exchanges emerges."
