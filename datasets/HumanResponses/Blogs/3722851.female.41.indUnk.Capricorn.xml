      I woke up this morning to a thunderstorm. Nothing new for Texas lately. I think we have had more rain this season than we've ever had. I love the rain. I love the way it sounds on our patio roof. I love how green everything gets and the way the air smells afterwards. I think I could sleep all day listening to it. But, I can't. Reality sets in and I have to get out of bed, get dressed and face the world today. It's been getting harder to face the world. I am depressed. Not just "sad" I mean clinically depressed. I am taking medications but they don't seem to be working at the moment. I have been waking up every morning with anxiety. It is uncomfortable. My heart beats harder and I have this overwhelming feeling of fear. Fear of what? I am guessing it has to do with our vacation coming. We leave on Friday. We are first going to Hudson FL to see my friend Lisa. I am thrilled about that. She's my best friend and I miss her. I hate that we live so far apart. We both whine about how unfair it is. She's been trying to get us to move there for years but it isn't feasible at this time for us. We are staying put in TX, it is our home now. We have lived her over 7 years. That is the longest I have lived in any one place my entire life. The next leg of our vacation will be in Jacksonville with the in-laws. My anxiety is getting worse just thinking about it. They aren't bad people. They are just very set in their ways and thinking. Very straight arrows. We, my family and I,  are not. We are very laid back and have the come what may attitude. We sleep, eat and socialize at our leisure. The kids are usually cranky the whole time we are there. They are tremendously BORED! If this isn't bad enough, we have a condo on the beach waiting for us. Guess whose coming with us? Yep, the in-laws. My vacation won't be a vacation. I will feel the pressures of what I "should" be doing instead of doing as I please. Afterall, it is my vacation. I should be able to sit and read or do whatever I want and not feel guilty over it. My husband thinks I am nuts. Even he doesn't get that I really am nuts. Certifiable and medicated. He tells me to ignore them. But I can't. My depressed state of mind and anxiety will over power me and they can't handle that. They, like most people think you have control over it. I think you do to a point, but not completely. It's going to be a long three weeks. I hope the rain doesn't follow us and make our beach vacation into a soggy one. Being stuck indoors with these people will push me over the edge!

      I don't know why I look forward to Friday so much. It doesn't mean I have a few days off. I am off everyday. Well, unless you take in consideration my duties of being a Domestic Engineer. Those duties keep me busy during the week for say, 2 hours, if that. I get to sleep in most days. My children are all old enough to take care of themselves. They are 12, 17 and 21. I also have a grandson who is 3.   I woke up this morning excited to go visit with my friend Amy. She been sick for a long time. We sit and watch TV, drink lattes, talk and laugh. It is always a highlight of my day to spend time with her. Some days we drive all over town for DR appointments, shopping and lunch. The lunch part is the hardest for Amy because she can't eat real food very well. She's a trooper though. She tries every time to eat. We feel it is a triumph if she can get more than 3 bites down!  Back to Friday. I think the biggest thing about it being Friday is my husband will be home for two days straight. Some times we go for a motorcycle ride. We find the back roads and take off for several hours of peace. I sit on the back and close my eyes and think. I think so peacefully, disregarding the noise coming from the motorcycle's engine and the air blowing across my helmet. It is the most peaceful time I can think of for me. I think about everything. My kids, my home, my friends and of course, I think about myself. It is a time to reflect on who I am and what I am doing with my life. There's nothing like it. I come home exhausted. not only from the heat and wind but from thinking so much. Who would have thought thinking could wear a person out?  This weekend there probably won't be a motorcycle ride. We have a lot of packing to do to go on our vacation. We leave next Friday for Florida. This trip is going to be stressful for me for a few reasons. I would have to go into detail to explain it all. I will do that when we get back. I would hate to project bad feelings or events before they happen. This next week of preparation will get to me as it is. I am sure I will share with you the happenings of preparing for a vacation to Florida.

      Tomorrow we leave for our 3 week vacation. I am experiencing so much anxiety. There's so much to do and I have put everything off til the last minute. I am usually pretty well organized by now and have most things ready to go. I guess it is the apprehension I am feeling that is causing my delay in organizing things. I am terrified about going and I don't know why. I'm sure that if I thought about it for a little while it would all come to me. So, let me think. Ah yes, the weight gain thing is a big deal to me. I have gained weight and I think everyone is going to say "look how fat she got!" I had Gastric Bypass surgery almost 3 years ago. I did great, lost 125 lbs. I have gained back about 30 lbs. This weighs heavily on my self esteem. I'm nervous about how things will go with the in-laws at the beach. Not to mention the 5 day stay at their house before we go to the condo at the beach. Another anxiety producing situation is, do I see my father while I am in Jacksonville? I emailed him with all the info he would need to get in touch with me. The ball is in his court now. I am nervous about leaving my mother alone for 3 weeks. She doesn't drive. My oldest daughter, Miranda (21), will be here and can help her when she needs something. She doesn't live far from here. Miranda will be joining us with her boyfriend and son for the last week. Every one is excited, but me. I wish we were going somewhere I could sit by the pool and drink all day! I better go pack, procrastination is not a good thing...
