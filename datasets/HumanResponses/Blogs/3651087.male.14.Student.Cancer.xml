       One day I was told by my senior that my president was noit very happy with me and yet i cannot or dont understand what did I have done wrong and I hope that she can tell me.Maybe it is because I have a disaggrement of thinking and I hope that I and my president will not have any misunderstandings.

       For you,what do you think of love? For me I can say that love is something that takes 2 person to form it .And there are factors for making love work they are:   -Trust -Sacrifice -Care -Jealous -Money  You may find it funny why I say Jealous and Money makes love work.   Jealous   It is because if your partner is jealous of you and someone being together then that shows that your partner cares for you .Your partner gets angry and when he/she shows it that shows that he want you to change at some parts. But if your partner is not angry then your relationship with him/her is facing a problem.   Money   You will need money to make love work too because if you don't have money then you may not be able to fufill what your partner wants .Money? The amount needed does need to be great but as long as it is enough for your expenses then it would be fine.  So love your partner and always check that whether is there any problems arising between u 2 .   What I have posted here is just what I personally think about love so if u don't agree please tell me so that I can have a better aspect of love.

           Yesterday,sykur gave sec 2s a meeting and he say that I fight with thrisna,eugene,jason.But it is not true I did not fight with thrisna but I fight with eugene and jason.I can never forget how jason suspect my leadership because it is a insult to me and so I get very annoyed of their words maybe I as a councillor is too strict with the sec 1s right but I dun want the secs 1 to have a bad record(Caning)And so I think is my job as a senior to help them.So that is why I am strict to them whereas for the sec 2s they are of my age and my friends u cant expect me to scold them like they are in sec 1 even towards the sec1 i also dun like that and the sec 2s are already a senior they surely dun want me to insult them until they got no face right so I am a bit soft to them I treat them with respect.

       Once again,I was in a new school.So was a girl in my class named paris.That;s where the similarities ended.I was tall,with a big moony face.She was petite and skinny with a model's delicate features.My thick black hair had been recently cut short into a shag style.Her natural caramel blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great when she flipped it aorund.  I was twelve and one of the oldest in the class .She was eleven and the youngest in the class.I was awkard and shy.She wasn't.  I wore baggy overalls,sweatshirts and lime green hiking boots.Paris wore nike shoes.I could not stand her,she was my enemy .She liked me and so we became friends.At first ,I hate her to the core but now I treat her as my best pal isn't it a good thing.  By Dakota Lanety  Lesson:  So what can you learn from this short text by a young author named Dakota .Don't ever compared with others about what you have and what you do not have because no matter how hard you compares there will always some weaknesses in you so dont ever try to compare with others .But in live we always compare with other people so we should try to change our thinking .

So whatever it is happy youth day to all the youths all over the world and Singapore.Hope that you can also but yuothful in mind ,soul,and body.

       -Anger  When I am angry with someone like my brother and people what I will do is I will take a deep breath and after I will sing a christian praise and worship song or I will:  -Talk to myself and reflect on the things that I have done -Eat an ice-cream(Gelato Ice-Cream) -Call either Nurul,Kok leong ,Nick,Sam to complain  -Talk to my parents about the incident -Listen to music -Cook something  You may find that my way of relieving anger is mad or nuts but u should tery it if you are angry because it will surely work.Because our anger comes from the soul and not from the body so we should relieve ourselves with soul medincine.  Or if you have a lover maybe you want to tell him or her ,for me I dont have one because I am a laughter boy in front of the people and I will share my love to everyone.  -Criticism  For it I will not do anything but ponder about it for a while I mean 1-10 mins.After that i will relfect and learn from my mistake and throw the comments out of my mind.All comments whether is it good or bad is all a lesson for us because in order to let people to cirticis on us definately have mistakes and things in our life or things that we dois wrong.So we should learn from all the comments said about us and not be angry of it .All tohse who have said about me or my close friends you should know that I will say:Thank You for your comments .Because I can change myself.Although I dont show it out on my face but I really think of my wrong doings at times.  So no matter what others say about you ,dont take it to hard on yourself because we need the time to think about what mistakes we have done.And for children out there dont get angry of what your teachers or elders(Parents)say about u because they want you good .I am a child I know.  To my mother and father:  I am sorry if I get annoyed when you say bad things about me because I am really sorry I know that u mean well so I will learn to change o.k  Whatever it is be happy and god will bless you .

       You may think that councillor is a person who plans actvities but for our school or most school a councillor is a person who not only plans actvities but we also act as a law enforcer.  I wonder sometimes what is leadership?It is a person who can promote a certain actvity or a person who can make a class to follow the school rules?  But to me I have a different deifination of Leadership ,it should be something which comes from the inside and not being trained out .So a good councillor should be able to :  -Get respect from the people -Get recongition -Obey the laws and set a good example -Encourage people to follow the rules -Correct people from getting into a path which is wrong.  So all school councillors out there ,if you think that you dont have these qualities dont give up because it also takes time
