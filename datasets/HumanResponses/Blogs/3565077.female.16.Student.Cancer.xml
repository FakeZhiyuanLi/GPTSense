      this wee old lady from the church my youth group supports on sunday afternoons came up to me at the end of the surface and said she'd seen me "blossom" over this year into a really nice christian girl..  it was very encouraging, but i thought a) she wouldn't say that if she knew what i still think like sometimes and  b) was i really paganistic last september or something? i guess i have improved...on the whole running away/overdosing/trying to hang self/cutting front...haven't done any of that stuff for months now. thats good, innit? i've thought i felt like some of it..but i didn't give in and the feelings fade eventually. they do come back though..but do you know what? i reckon i have got seasonary affective disorder, at least partly...my three big major bouts of depression have been around november to march time, and i always feel worse at night. i reckon it must have something to do with light, i should really look into putting up light boxes or something. that might improve things! yay!

      lol...i wrote this today...hows it for surreal?!  ****************************************************************************  trying and failing and wanting and hoping and being and seeing and believing  your life away  but they who fall longest fall softly  then melt away fade away stay away breathe into the billows  the smoke confirms it:  they are gone  time passes and edges towards the shape in the curtains  where it warps and transforms before me  stroke the face of one you love now, quickly  before the dust rises and smothers us  memories are at your heels:  leave!  growling and snapping behind you they come  grip your ankle, you collapse, panting  down at the edges of the spiritual stream  where only the holy can play.   *************************************************************************************  i have to say...i love the last two lines, dunno why particuarly. today i sang in church..highly embarassing, plus i'm not very good at recieving compliments, it makes me uncomfortable, and everyone was saying i was good. lol i know it sounds like im moaning about nothing, but it was an odd feeling. i sang "just as i am" with me playing my guitar and ben backing me on his guitar, i found some of the lyrics really moving, especially considering how i've been feeling the past few days. i was nearly crying at one point actually! i'll post them...  Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, though tossed about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need in Thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, Thy love unknown Hath broken every barrier down; Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.   Just as I am, of that free love, The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, O Lamb of God, I come, I come!   "healing of the mind" and the bit about being tossed about really struck me..it was like i realised god doesnt care how screwed up we are! yay! when i sat down after playing it i felt this energy running through me, i could feel god's spirit in me it was really amazing. also EVERYTHING in the 3 services i went to today seemed to speak to me..it was really cool, as i was praying last night but god didnt seem to be replying, but today hes doing everything at once!

      looking back on my life, i'm a bit disappointed. i know i'm only 15, but i think i expected to have done more by now...i feel like the last few years have just been a big blurry mess. trying to break out of the clutches of depression, then failing. not accomplishing much, if anything. but if i want this situation to change, i will have to do it myself. i realise this now.   so...  what to do?  well, even though it's not a new year or anything, it feels that way as we just got off school, so the summer stretches in front of me before 5th year begins. so this summer i could try to get my head sorted out, deal with my paranoia etc. it's really all to do with the way i think..i analyse things half to death, and i catastrophise. but i think i do have the potential to be quite a cool, intelligent person..yes, i believe i do.  plus this sounds relly wierd but...yeah i'll just say it anyway. last night i got this verse, daniel 8:18  "as he was speaking to me, i fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet."  i think for the past couple of years i've been basically in a sleep, but god will put me back on my feet. yesterday it was all about the "but i thought i would get better before"s etc, but i will have faith that i won't sink back into depression. i have to, cos if i don't believe that i literally have no reason to live anymore. if i thought my entire life would be like the last two years i wouldn't want to live like that.  anyways, this is the wierd bit...after i'd thought about the verse i got this feeling god was hugging me. it sounds stupid, but it was a really great feeling. i still have it now, actually. so i know he's with me, whatever. :-)  last night i went to this meeting about the revivaly thingy on castle hill (for want of a better name) that i technically wasn't invited to, i just came along anyway, so that was a bit of a bummer as garreth was saying how everyone invited was "vital" and i felt really stupid for going! it's fustrating cos i want to make a difference but i think i'm either considered too young, or too screwed up. i'm wondering if i will ever be able to contribute something here where people percieve me as a basket case. even a reformed basket case is really not the image i'm going for... mleeh. anyway, that's the way things are, can't change it. just have to try, however futile it may be, to improve it. and then change my name and move to mexico in july when i'm 16 where noone knows my past. :-P

      here begins the spiel of christian events...we attend them, we get hyper, we go back home and go on holiday somewhere, then we go back to school and we wonder why real life isn't like summer madness or soul survivor. then, usually round october, i get depressed and the whole circle begins again...this has happened consistently for the past two years. what will be different about this one?   i know the answer: i have to make it different.  but what if i fail? what-ifs are the bane of my life..

      what does it take to be one? i think i have fulfilled most of the credentials...  i really can't be bothered doing anything right now. i literally have no energy, i haven't got my coursework done for thursday so i think i shall get into trouble. but ce'st la vie. we did sylvia plath again in english. i wish we didn't have to, it makes me feel really odd just to read her poems. they speak to me in a way that's almost frightening. i read one today called "lady lazarus" and thought "hmm, that's me with my many suicide attempts"...not that i necessairly feel like that now. i just feel numb, i really want to get out of this rut for more than a few days but this seems impossible. i wish god would just tell me what i should be doing and would give me the nudge i need...of course, he's constantly speaking to me, but i'm deaf to his words, i keep blocking them out with dark thoughts and doubts. and that's entirely my fault. yesterday grace said she thought i was trying too hard to hear god etc, but i think the problem is i don't try at all. i'm so lazy, i aggravate myself...everyone seems annoyed with me now. well maybe not so much annoyed, but just dissmisive. i'll try to talk and their attention spans will fail them half way through and they'll politely excuse themselves to go and talk to someone funnier/better looking/cleverer than me. it always works that way.  and the thing i hate most?  the fact that i'm whining about all this like some disgruntled 2 year old...

      in english today we read a poem called tulips by sylvia plath, which is below...  The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage ---- My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free ---- The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I hve no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.  i really like it, but it disturbed me and brought back all these crap thoughts and memories that i had got quite used to being without. she talks about not wanting to have responsibility in life, and in a sense i don't either. i'm really terrified of growing up incase i don't meet people's expectations of me and i end up alone. i find it hard to believe anyone likes me really, part of me wants to believe it but the other darker side of me shies away from daring to believe i could have purpose or meaning as that would give me something to aim for, and what if i don't make it? i think i know part of the plan god has for my life, but what if it all falls through and i hate myself because of it. i'm just gradually falling back into yet another stupid depressed state, and if all it takes to spark it off is a suicidal ish poem by a woman who later did kill herself how am i going to survive life? my brain works in all these stupid ways and i assume things and my paranoia eats at my insides. i feel like everyone sees this stupid attention seeking person but theres actually a side to me noone gets and that i cant convince them of. see, now i really want to talk to someone but i dont think anyone would want to listen to me ramble on in an egocentric fashion for ages. i mean, people have their limits, ive experienced that. people get sick of me, i just have to deal with it.

      english coursework. on the last weekend of term. really hard coursework at that, which takes you literally around 7 hours and which your writing slowly deterirates during the course of and causes you to freak out majorly... (this involves holding your head in your hands and silently screaming)  i think my main problem with it was cos i havent done a proper bit of schoolwork for about 4 or 5 months, what with being off school etc. its incredibly hard to get back into the swing of doing it again. and now i'm so tired but upset i won't be able to sleep, i'll just sit up being paranoid and stressed.   bleeh. I HATE GCSES  so there. grr stupid examination board  this is supposed to be a day of rest!! (well, its yesterday now)  i was busy all saturday, i had to do it today. its not fair!!! *resists urge to have tantrum*  rite-o, im off to (attempt to) sleep off this terrible mood. i'll write something more spiritually enlightening tomorrow...

      okay, so today i was sitting in biology doing nothing, just letting my mind wander.  suddenly i had a thought. (an actual thought! wow!!) even more surprisingly, this was a good thought.  i was thinking about the fact that i am really too attached to my posessions, and that i really wanted to give something to the street kids in rio, brasil, and then it hit me that i could either sell all the stuff i really don't need and give the money to them or i could just send stuff like clothes etc to them direct, through a charity i know. how cool! also i was pondering what to do for my 16th birthday, which is next month, and i thought instead of having people buy me presents i could ask them to donate money to the street kids, and i could have some sort of party which would be very cheap to run, if not free, where we'd have fun and then i could explain briefly what they'd donated to. it's so cool! plus i really think the lack of all this extra "stuff" in my life would really clear my mind more to think about my studies, and (far more importantly) about god. yay!! all i have to do is two things 1) figure out what this party would actually consist of and 2) convince mum and dad!!  plus, i am so becoming a fully fledged hippy...not only am i a vegetarian, i wear tye dye and long floaty dresses with bells, i play acoustic guitar, i like walking barefoot and i want a volkswagen hippy van when i can drive, but im giving away half my wordly posessions! all i need to do now is smoke pot... (joke)

      okay, so i was left home in the wee small hours last night and i have school today...why did i feel i should get up at 6 am just to go on the internet! i am literally almost dead now... ...concert was fab though! we only knew about 2 songs, but we bought merchandise, waved our posters and generally screamed a lot, and they showed me and nat on the big screen at the front so i think we fooled em into thinking we were ardent fans. (little did they know, heh heh heh)i really hope that was the right context for ardent by the way, i have a habit of using big words without really knowing what they mean. then i just make an eejit out of myself. *sighs* soo i suppose now i should really go get ready for school... yeah, lack of posts over past couple of days was owing to our computer getting a nasty virus. typical charismatic moi decides to try to cure it, not by calling the nice people from microsoft, but by preforming a sort of technical exorcism, complete with fervent prayer leant over the keyboard and hands placed on the monitor, and then i get all upset when it doesn't work. "come on God!" i yell, "you created the world, for flip's sake! it's just a computer!!" nothing, no heavenly lightning bolt illuminates the screen, so i figure maybe he's off doing something more important (pah! what could be more important??!!) and mooch off defeated while dad calls the microsoft helpline... mleeh. anyway, i must get dressed.

      ...are a really cool french band. when you try putting their lyrics into an online translating thing, they come out really badly worded yet somehow still pleasing...  J'ai cherché l'erreur  Au coeur des systèmes,  Ce qui brille est un leurre  Ce qui brille peut fondre au soleil   J'ai cherché l'erreur  Qui trouble mon sommeil,  J'ai cherché pendant des heures  Pour voir que tout est à refaire,  Enfin tout est clair, je relève la tête...   Je veux vivre chaque seconde  Comme si demain était la fin du monde,  Etre libre pour de bon,  A trop vouloir se lever on tombe...   Abandonner la fièvre,  Ne plus regarder en arrière,  Trouver l'essentiel  Pour enfin oublier le reste   Je ne veux plus d'adresse,  Je ne veux plus qu'en vain on se blesse,  Je voudrais pouvoir éclore  Et demain sourire encore   En fait, tout est clair, je relève la tête...   Je veux vivre chaque seconde  Comme si demain était la fin du monde,  Etre libre pour de bon,  A trop vouloir se lever on tombe...   Je veux vivre chaque seconde  Comme si demain était la fin du monde,  Etre libre pour de bon,  A trop vouloir se lever on tombe...   Je veux vivre chaque seconde  Comme si demain était la fin du monde,  Etre libre pour de bon,  A trop vouloir se lever on tombe...  becomes...  I sought the error In the system main part,  What is shining is a lure What shines can melt with the sun   I sought the error Which disturbs my sleep,  I sought during hours to see that all is to be remade,  Finally all is clear, I raise the head...   I want to live each second As so tomorrow was the end of the world,  To be free for good,  To too much wanting to rise one falls...   To give up the fever,  Not to look at more behind,  To find essence For finally forgetting the remainder   I do not want any more an address,  I do not want any more that in vain one is wounded,  I would like to be able to hatch And still smile tomorrow   In fact, all is clear, I raise the head...   I want to live each second As so tomorrow was the end of the world,  To be free for good,  To too much wanting to rise one falls...   I want to live each second As so tomorrow was the end of the world,  To be free for good,  To too much wanting to rise one falls...   I want to live each second As so tomorrow was the end of the world,  To be free for good,  To too much wanting to rise one falls...  i like it! like this one too...  Prisonnier de ton enchantement  On fait l'affaire de nos sentiments  On dirait l'âme, on dirait le corps  Quand on mène qui est le plus fort  Et moi je cours   Mais comment te dire  Les mots ne viennent pas  Libérez les sons de ma voix  Je voudrais arrêter le temps  Passer en toi  Mais laisse-moi te dire   Pris au piège par le souffle imminent  De ton retour tout c'qui nous attend  On dirait l'âme, on dirait le sang  Tu touches mon coeur  L'esprit s'en ressent  Et moi je suis fou   Mais comment te dire  Les mots ne viennent pas  Libérez les sons de ma voix  Je voudrais arrêter le temps  Passer en toi  Laisse-moi te dire   Comment te dire  Les mots ne viennent pas  Libérez les sons de ma voix  Je voudrais arrêter le temps  Passer en toi  Mais laisse-moi te dire  En amour on n'sait rien  On est rien  On est rien  On est rien...  is  Prisoner of your enchantment One makes the deal of our feelings One would say the heart, the body would be said When one carries out who is strongest And me I run   But how to say you the words do not come Libérez the sounds of my voice I would like to stop Passer time in you But lets say you to me   Taken with the trap by the imminent breath Of your return all which awaits us One would say the heart, one would say to blood You keys my heart the spirit feels some And me I am insane   But how to say you the words do not come Libérez the sounds of my voice I would like to  stop Passer time in you Laisse to say you to me   How to say you the words do not come Libérez the sounds of my voice I would like to stop Passer time in you But lets say you to me In love one does not know anything One is nothing One is nothing One is nothing...  want to listen to them? go here: www.kyomusic.com click on entrez, then musique, and all the songs are in a list from the album "le chemin". you can listen to bits of all of them plus there's three videos, one where one guy out of the band is in a skirt!!

      well, last night i was talking to ash on msn and i was feeling really depressed, as ive been for the past couple of days. i had this really strong picture in my mind that jesus was laughing at me being this way, it sounds stupid but it was a really clear image that kept flashing up in front of me and it upset me. something ash said to me was that i might think i was disgusting etc but god thought i was like this beautiful princess in a really pure white dress and he was the one who saw things clearly, not me. then i went off to my room and thought about it and the words just came into my head "i'm not laughing at you, princess." it sounds really random but they meant more to me than anything...i drew this picture of jesus hugging a princess (me), which is probably appallingly over sentimental and stupid, but it really means a lot to me. it's a bit rough, i only added two colours as i thought that was all that was required. i haven't added faces because i've never really wanted to define what jesus looks like, also i was having a bit of a "crap at art" night...i like my pic though. :)   urlLink Mail0022.jpg   this morning i woke up with the 24 hour bug thing my sister had yesterday, so i'm not at that fine establishment of learning, the royal school dungannon, today. (ha! ha! ha!) i had a chat with mum and she says it would be fine if, come next march, i still want to go to tech after fifth year. so i can actually leave the halls of RSD to become a distant memory...yay! and then i want to take a year out to do youthwork, then do a combined practical youth work and theology course at uni. i'm really excited, as i think this is what god has called me to do and i actually want to do it too, which is always a bonus... *grins* i feel much better now anyway, in short. isn't that nice? i know i'll have to work hard to get all the crap exams done that are coming up, but bring it on as far as i'm concerned. because i'm really looking forward to what's waiting for me beyond the splurge of academia. (wow - coolest phrase ever! the "splurge of academia"...)  yeah. yayness! :-D

      what are you doing? do you love me when it feels like noone else does? do you come to me in visions and bright lights or in silences? don't you think i deserve to have it easy for a while? i've been depressed for years now, when will you come and let me feel your presence with me? others tell me i have you, but i want to feel you have me...i know im selfish and greedy and ungreatful god, i know i don't "deserve" anything. but i just hear about these people having these experiences of you and i'm wondering where mine is. where is it lord? why has my joy evapourated again? it's more than a case of a "bad day" here and there, it goes deeper. just as i'm on the home strait the road becomes longer and rockier and i feel like i can't go on. stretches out ahead of me and i'm tired, i don't want to run. i want to feel your arms around me but all i feel is cold, distanced from you. held at arms length, don't let her get too close. i'm doing my bit god, i am! i'm running after you and reaching out for your touch but feels like you're shrinking away from me, watching me fall flat on my face time after time and as i reach for your hand to pull me up with, you take it away from me. prove it god. prove you care. prove it actually matters whether i'm here or not, come on. bring it on god, i don't care if you strike me down with a thunderbolt, as long as i get a glimpse of you to make sure you're there. i read a verse the other day that said you don't show favouritism, want to show me that?? i know im ignorant and foolish and proud and demanding, jesus, i'm sorry. i'm just desperate, crying out for you, please hear me god. please answer me.

      excuse this minor rant... today was fairly awful, as days go. i'm loosing my voice and i have a rehersal for my singing exam tomorrow, my actual exam is at the end of the week. i tried on my lovely customised 3rd day top and discovered i should have gone for a size bigger, it's really tight, i look hideous in it. oh yeah, and my form teacher says i might have to repeat the year, as i've missed huge chunks cos i was off for so long with depression. i really don't want to go through 4th year again, i just want to get my gcses over with next year. i'm thinking of going to tech to do my AS and A levels, cos honestly i really do not like my school. it's so results orientated, it just does my head in. :( sorry for the rant! xxx

      last night i travelled down to dublin expecting to go to a youth service...it was actually a disco thingy. the kind i absoloutely can't stand, with usher's "yeah" *shudder of distaste* booming through the stereo system at 5000 decibels, meaning any conversation has to be conducted at a louder volume than that. it was quite a surprise, not least for the adults who had taken us there (this was emma-lous commisioning), most of whom spent the evening as far from the stage as possible, wearing decidedly fixed grins. there was a large contingent of the local 13 year old girl population, most of whom were wearing clothes of the short and sparkly variety. i suppose this was city youth, being from the country we just gawped. garreth, our youth leader was walking around talking to the youth, which he suggested we should do too. i did attempt this with leanne, another youthy leader leading the way, but seriously, i am going to make a completely crap youth leader unless i get some training in talking to strangers, because i can't do it. leanne would go up and start a conversation, "well hello there! what's the craic, hi, i'm leanne" etc. i would smile apprehensively, then my mind would go blank and to avoid standing staring at em i would just go and sit back down in my "floor spot".    after a lot of very loud music, they invited emma-lou and all the other team on mission bods onstage and the head of the methodist church in ireland commisioned them. without wishing to pick holes in the planning of it i really did think it would have been better if they had done this in a church service rather than at an event like this, as it wasn't what the kids had come to see, and it wasn't a very supportive or holy atmosphere for the people getting commissioned with the youth talking away throughout the whole thing. i suppose the logic behind it was that the team on mission were going to be ministering to kids like these, but the whole thing was a bit odd. then the designated evangelist guy did a talk, but they yattered through that too. his dublin accent was so thick i gave up trying to make out what he was saying two minutes into it, and just prayed for the event and the youth there as i felt that was the only thing i could do, as i was crap at talking to them. i thought the kids would maybe identify with him, but some prat recited his "asking jesus into your heart" prayer after him in such a mocking way it made me think maybe they didn't. maybe some did, hopefully. i resisted the urge to go hit this prat by praying for him too. it was really depressing the way when we left we were told to lock our car and not to ask for directions, this was a "bad area". i really hate the generalisation of whole areas as "bad." not everyone there falls under that banner, surely. and even if they do shouldn't we be out talking to them, instead of driving past quickly in fear? well, not if you're like me and don't even have enough courage to talk to them. but seriously, it only takes one prat to give a whole area a bad name. like all the stupid terrorists have given northern ireland a bad name, when the majority of people here are really nice. and the terrorists are probably nice deep down too, just confused. noones really a prat i guess, its just a series of unfortunate events and crap choices that make them seem that way. i don't know, i just think it would be really cool if god used this country everyone has written off to really make an impact for him. cos god doesn't care how the world views places, he doesn't see anywhere or anyone as dodgy or suspect. he just sees potential.

      i love this song...it's probably heresy but oh well. :)  If God had a name, what would it be And would you call it to his face If you were faced with him in all his glory What would you ask if you had just one question  And yeah yeah God is great yeah yeah God is good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  What if God was one of us Just a slob like one of us Just a stranger on the bus Trying to make his way home  If God had a face what would it look like And would you want to see If seeing meant that you would have to believe In things like heaven and in jesus and the saints and all the prophets  And yeah yeah god is great yeah yeah god is good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  What if God was one of us Just a slob like one of us Just a stranger on the bus Trying to make his way home He's trying to make his way home Back up to heaven all alone Nobody calling on the phone Except for the pope maybe in rome  And yeah yeah God is great yeah yeah God is good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  What if god was one of us Just a slob like one of us Just a stranger on the bus Trying to make his way home Just trying to make his way home Like a holy rolling stone Back up to heaven all alone Just trying to make his way home Nobody calling on the phone Except for the pope maybe in rome

      trapped in the silences and we struggle against our truths what are we achieving? keep thoughts to ourselves afraid of reactions of others when inside all our thoughts are the same why so scared, so petrified of accountability afraid it will shatter illusions of holiness but the only way to purity is through stripping off pretence  and approaching the throne on our knees letting ourselves cry, scream do whatever you need to convey your feelings he won't think less of you feel free

      linkin park. from my experience, people either love them or hate them. i am yet to meet a person who is indifferent in their opinion of linkin park. anyways, it cannot be denied that: a)their video for breaking the habit is fantastic and b) they do have talent, lyrics wise. (well okay, you could deny it but don't bother. :P)  anyways, the lyrics really struck me as i was watching it, so i thought i'd post em.   Breaking the Habit  Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safer in my room Unless I try to start again  I don't want to be the one Who battles always choose Cos inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  Cultured my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I have no options left again  I dont want to be the one Who battles always choose Cos inside I realize That I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  I'll paint it on the walls Cos I'm the one that falls I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight  i think i mostly like the fact that the word "instigate" was used...just one of those random words i like for no apparent reason. like pandamoneium, only i have a reason for liking that, cos it reminds me of pandas. :)  seriously though, i do think i need to really get my ass in gear if i'm going to break all my crappy habits. noteably these would include . swearing (although i do find myself saying ffff...BOTHER more often now) . completely abusing god's grace by doing something i know is wrong, apologising then doing it again. and . getting bogged down in depressive thoughts when i should be focusing on jesus. this guy on a forum i post on said to me today "I was where you seem to be, but now - I am free. So can you be. And trust me, once free, you will praise the Lord our God and you will see the world as a different place. An entirely different place." i really want that freedom, and i think if i put enough effort into feeling happy i might be able to grasp it. i really want the world to change from this cold horrible place into a really bright sunny happy place, but i don't know if that's realistic. everyone keeps saying i have to face the fact that i might never recover from my depression, thing is i don't want to face feeling crap for the rest of my life and living in a miserable slimy reality. in fact, i refuse to face it!

      do you ever feel disconnected somehow? like your life is really a play, and you're watching yourself have it out with other characters from the audience? odd, i know...sometimes i just feel so detatched, i can see what's happening but i'm really powerless to do anything, the earth keeps spinning, turning away and here i am stuck in the same place. it will change though, when god comes. i have so much faith in this i'm blind to everything else, all the sceptics who don't think it will work. god has told me it will so i'm just relying on him, picking up my cross and carrying on even though i'll get called wierd for it. i feel like what debs was saying in her blog, i know my struggles are nothing like on the scale of many people, but they're mountains to me. this could be lack of strength on my part but what i lack in stamina i will make up for in determination. i've been stuck in this pit for ages, now i'm not relying on others to haul me out but climbing out myself, chanelling my failing energy through god who is lifting me up. every day is like a battle, struggling against the negative emotions which threaten to overwhelm me, but i won't be brought down again. i'm tearing the flimsy walls apart which i used to use to defend me from lifes ups and downs and crawling into the arms of my father. he's everything i need, my life source. thankyou x

      oh, i forgot to congratulate myself... last night i had a knife and i was going to make another cut, therby screwing up my legs for another six months until it healed, but i didn't! which means i might have actually quit self harming, seeing as i last cut myself about a month ago!!   *pats self on back*  cheers jesus! couldn't have done it without you...when i wanted to do it i prayed in tounges and did my scribbly drawing and then the feeling went away! i've found other coping mechanisms! yay!  also, today i was playing my guitar and worshipping and i really could feel god's presence in the room with me...ended up repeating the line "come lord jesus come" about fifty times...even though he was already there...just wanted him to show his power and pour out his love on dungannon...cos abba it needs your healing touch! and he will. he's on it right now!  it's so wonderful i just want to dance round the room for hours... everytime i open the bible today i'm getting the story of david bringing the ark to jerusalem, think god might be speaking through it but i can't think what he's saying. hold on, i'll pray for a min here.  *********************************************************************************  okay, just talked with garreth and i think i've figured it out...god is looking for us to seek the revival, but his way, not our own. the reason uzzah died in the story was cos he touched the ark of the covenant, and the only reason he had to touch it to steady it was cos they were carrying the ark on a cart instead of on golden poles, which was the way god had said it had to be carried. no buts! the thing is, david got pissed off with god when this happened, started to doubt that god wanted to come to jerusalem at all and just left the ark in this guys house for a while. however, when he saw the blessing that this guy whose house he left it at got, he thought "wow, god's working with that guy...he'll work in jerusalem now!" this time he went off and brought the ark to jerusalem on god's authority, not his. and when he got there it was wonderful!!! incredible!!!!!!! the ark is god's revival, and maybe dungannon has got disillusioned with it before cos things haven't worked out like people thought they would. however, if we do this on god's terms, it'll be fantastic!!! the key verses here are verses 9 and 10... "david was afraid of the lord that day and said, "how can the ark of the lord ever come to me?" he was not willing to take the ark of the lord to be with him in the city of david." god can't fight our will. the choice, ultimately, is ours. if we want our town to be blessed, we can't afford to get disillusioned and give up. if we aren't willing to put our own way aside for god, nothing will ever happen.  also i got psalm 2 verse twelve "kiss the son, lest he be angry" we have got to throw aside all our religious jargon and be open before god, even if it's scary and out of our comfort zone. we have to draw near enough to jesus to feel his kiss, near to the almighty one even though we're trembling and our heads are bowed. he promises later in the verse that "blessed are all who take refuge in him"  thanks god!!!!

      today during my maths exam i couldn't do half of the questions. herin lies the dilemma: should i have written crap for the ones i couldn't do, or just left em out? which would've got me into more trouble? i chose to leave them out. i really hope this was right, as our teacher has a habit of throwing desks at students in temper and a very short fuse...  *looks worried*

      mmm...first post on the new blog. can i keep it up this time? (this is the girl who starts blogs, does about 1 post, then abandons them...)  well, hi anyway. today has already been a rather eventful day, i woke up wanting to die and now i don't. isn't that encouraging? i think so...now i'm just hyper about what god is going to do in dungannon. because he says he's going to move here, and i'm completely convinced of that... i believe a cheer is called for. YAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   last night i discovered something useful: scribbling relieves tension very well! here's my 3am artwork...    urlLink Mail0018    depressing, but oh well. hmmm, i'm thinking i perhaps should do some maths revision, considering my exam begins in about 2 hours. it's my last one. but i've done crap in all my other ones, so if i can do this well it can be my "dying swan" thingmybobbie. do i ever make sense to anyone apart from myself? perhaps not, but that's how god made me!! *grins*

         it is always best to check you haven't got a huge hole in your trousers  before  wearing them    best to phone your parents to let them know where you are etc. before they begin driving round to your friend's houses, searching for you    my feeble brain cannont comprehend the sheer confusingness of the matrix final chapter. still feels overworked.    don't start singing george michael's "faith" complete with hummed guitar intro and extra emphasis on "well i guess it would be  niceee " when leading a kiddie christian club in front of the local presbyterian minister,&nbsp;getting to the "if i could touch your body" bit just as you pass him. never a good idea.

      if you believe you are right,&nbsp;are you&nbsp;right to say others are wrong?  can you criticise their views, pretend your own are strong? then you crash and burn, prove they've been right all along -  is it alright?  in an odd mood. happy, yet fundamentally odd. i'm a bit tired, and i feel all thoughtful and wierd. mleh.   today i had my revision day with my counsellors, it was okay. i got really emotional and started crying my eyes out whenever she said i didn't have a mature work ethic - just emphasised her point really. still, i got a fair bit of revision done, and i bought a hat. so a good time was had by all. i also asked her about baptism, she said she'd ask the pastor if it was pos. wow! must ask parents at some point though... (they always come last don't they? how sad. *sighs*)

      i just re-read the post before my last one and guess what - the thing about "god makes something beautiful out of failures" was repeated on saturday night in a talk by my mate nat's dad. again, something inside me went "yoink". i think i'm getting spoken to! cool! i'm gonna be all pretty...i am actually deliriously happy right now, despite the imminent meeting with my counsellor tomorrow morning to explain why i have done no work. today i bought a child's set of miniture golf, and wore a mop on my head for a while, and now my fave prog spooks is on about spy people in 2 mins. plus yesterday i had a really good worshippy thing, just me and my guitar. and god, of course. i could really feel him there though! in the service i was at on sunday the talk was on psalm 24, especially the bit about "those with clean hands and a clean heart" can "ascend the hill of the lord." so now whenever i feel like sinning i just remember i can't lift my hands to god in worship when they're unclean, and i go pray instead. you'd think i would have realised this ages ago, but it's only just sunk in now. and i feel much closer to god cos of it. *grins cheesily* right'o, i'm away to watch my spy drama thing. irish telly channels rock, they're repeating the first series i missed when it was on the beeb! happy days! can't think why anyone should care about this, but it makes me happy...

      cos if you smile everything seems about fifty times better than it actually is. trust me. it works.   anyways, what's been going on...  well, i'm doing summer school, 11-12 year olds. it's fun, some of the guys really test the boundaries a bit, but then i just dock their points. cos i can. i'm a leader. (ha! ha! ha!)  on the revision front, things have been a bit of a non starter with summer school on, im so knackered when i get home i can never get round to doing any work. however i feel this is excusable, at least fairly excusable. i'm just hoping my counsellor shares my view on wednesday when i have to explain why i have done no work.   COUNTDOWN to family holiday to italy is 1 week, 4 days and counting...good points about this are cute guys, interesting things to see like pompei (really not how you spell it) and pizza. also dad has promised to take me to the veggie restaurant in rome. bad points are: i'm with my family 24/7 i don't like excessively hot weather boring things dad will enevitabley drag us round like a ruin consisting of one brick, which we shall be forced to "ooh" and "ahh" at and the fact that the 2nd week of our holiday is more or less a beach holiday, which i find incredibly boring. i lie around at home, why do i need to fork out hundreds of pounds to lie around in a foreign country for a week?  last night i was at a service in a christian fellowship church and i saw an ad in the piece of paper they gave you out about baptism in lough neagh, and that if you wanted to get baptised there you could fill out a piece of paper and leave it in with them. one of the dates was august 29th. suddenly something inside me went "zinng" and i knew i really wanted to do that. i think god wants me to, much more importantly. i had just been thinking about getting baptised when jennifer did, my friend at the baptist church i go to, but then i thought, "why wait?" i really want to do something to signify to god that i'm not going to have another year like last year or the two years previously, i'm going to work hard and grow with him and trust etc and i'm going to be able to move on in my life. i was praying about it last night, didn't get anything specifically about the baptism though i can feel there's an approval behind it i think, like it's not just some random idea i had on my own. i did get some fantastic bible verses about moving on etc, best of which was this one: jeremiah 30. v 18  "the city will be rebuilt on her ruins"  then i looked in my study bit at the bottom, and the comment on that verse was  "the hebrew for this word (ruins) is tel(l), referring to a mound of ruins resulting from the acculimiation of the debris of many years or centuries of occupation and on which successive series of towns were often built."  so this was like my life had been a mound of ruins, all piling on top of each other as i was occupied by depression for years, but it's gonna be squashed down and built on, my life which was crap but all the crap was a good foundation for the city that is to come. does that make sense?   also i got this really nice verse isaiah 40 v 11 "he tends his flock like a shepherd: he gathers the lambs into his arms and carries them close to his heart"  to which all i have to say is: "baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

      today at the baptists (no samuel sadly) the speaker was incredible. they haven't a pastor currently so usually it's more or less down to chance whether the speaker is good or not, but this guy was sensational. i doubted this when he used the king james version (typical teenager who refuses to accept anything the "oldies" use) but when he began his sermon he was fab. it was all about stepping out of your comfort zone, doing what god is telling you to do even if it scares the shit out of you. he really believed in what he was saying, you could tell by the way he argued his point, there were tears in his eyes as he told us how god had opened his eyes to the needy in his area and he's gone to visit the drug addicts and the alchoholics and the other "outcasts" of our society. he said at one point "god makes something beautiful out of failures" and that sentence really echoed in my head, when i remembered the things i'd written stating i was a failure. i felt commissioned to go out and help people now, it won't start when i'm enroled as a youth worker, it should start now. so i went out into the carpark and talked to my friend's brother, who seemed upset. we got onto the subject of self harm, i never thought he would open up so much to me and i actually felt equipped to help him with this, as i knew all about it. and over the next two weeks i'm hoping to help at a kid's club thing, i'm really excited about what god could do through it. i feel as if i can support others as opposed to others supporting me, and it feels fantastic! :-D

      forced to pummel computer keyboard for about 20 bloody minutes until it would let me into the blog spot site...i hate technology! ahh! *aims kick at offending computer*  was about to type offending COMUTER there..wow i am tired. my counsellors in lurgan, all for the good of my gcse results have set me a punishing revision rota. in the summer holidays, i ask you?! where is my fun in the sun?? (not that there is much fun to have fun in...but i bet some shall appear just as i sit down to another two hours of de valera, just you wait...)*sighs* i'd better pass, that's all i can say. and do you know what i am forced to study? the flippin inepitude and downright sneakiness of the unionist government, who dad always taught me were perfect. do you know what they did? they introduced a law that made it possible to arrest and detain people without trial. isn't that incredible? in 1922 or something this law was made, which meant basically they could just chuck you inside if they didn't like the look of you. and do you know when this was lifted? in 19 flipping 70!!! and it didn't really change then either, they just amended it into the internment law, which was the same sort of thing. apparently jerry adams was interned for years. i mean i don't like him and all his ira links, but he does have a very legitimate reason to be pissed off. you can bet no unionists were chucked in jail for no reason.     in other news, my little sister is going away tomorrow to camp. this means a whole week of lying in! yes!! (i am usually awoken by her elbowing me in the ribs so i jump about a foot in the air) also tomorrow i am hopefully seeing samuel again. samuel is a three year old who goes to the baptist church which i frequent from time to time. he refers to me as "big friend". once he poured an entire ice cream tub of crayons on top of the scary guy who likes me and keeps kicking me under the table's head. this cemented our friendship. our games of "mutant dinosaurs attack noah's ark" are the stuff of legend. it's nice to be liked, nay, adored. i am a semi-god to him, especially when i am wielding the digestives. :-)

      yeah. well, my computer has been rather stupid for the last 2 weeks and wouldn't let me online, so that's why the posting has been few and far between of late. also, i have just returned from summer madness, where a number of cool things occured, but in a way i'd rather they wouldn't have. yes, it's confusing...well basically, i was hit with this huge wave of depression a couple of days into summer madness, so bad i was contemplating hurting myself, which i hadn't even thought about for ages. i could feel god was telling me it was time to move out of this phase of my life, but i was reluctant to grab his hand to pull me up as i knew this new phase he was leading me into would be scary, perhaps even scarier than depression. even though depression was awful, at least i was used to it and it was familiar. i went for prayer ministry and the people suggested that maybe i needed to take some responsibility for the way i felt. this completely freaked me out: i am very bad at acknowledging my feelings could be partly my fault. and, to be fair, the they aren't - but it's the crap way i deal with them that makes me feel so much worse and i need to take responsibility for that. the prayer guys said i shouldn't expect god or pills or counselling or whatever to zap me out of depression without putting in the work myself, and do you know what, although this originally pissed me off, they were absoloutely right. so on the last morning,i made a decision: 1. i refuse to be suicidal and cutting etc again. no friggin way. 2. i'm going to take responsibility for my actions. feelings i can't control, but i can change em, and i intend to!  cool things that also happened at summer madness were that: i lost all dignity and started dancing in worship like a crazy woman! yeah!! i was worshipping with my hand to the sky when i saw jesus standing in front of me. he told me to reach out my hand and he put his palm against mine. i could feel him there. then he put his hand on my shoulder and we hugged. i looked around the room and suddenly i saw thousands of jesus', all the same guy though, standing in front of everyone in the hall. some couldn't see him cos they had their faces turned to the sky but he was right in front of them, arms outstretched. i asked god what i should do, and he said "cheer people up." yay! i was sitting with my back against a wall, praying, when i felt someone sit beside me and put their hand on my head, but there was noone. then i felt someone sit on my other side and put their arm round me, again noone. then i saw the holy spirit sitting beside me with his hand on my head, and holy oil was running from his hand down my face, annointing oil. jesus was sitting on my other side, arm around me, and god was standing in front of me, holding both my hands. i was in 24-7 worship when they played a song i'd never heard before but every lyric was so prophetic about dungannon and the hill community we want to create. it was amazing, all about "reclaiming stolen ground" and "god's holy city on a hill". ie dungannon! :) i was lying on my back on the floor during worship, and i could feel gods presence falling on me like a blanket  summer madness was amazing! and now i am really energised to stand up for god, and i really feel gods pulled me up to this other level thing with him.   also, i'm planning on revising all the bags of stuff i missed from school last year being absent for so long over the next couple of weeks so i may actually stand a chance of passing om gcses! yay! and my councellors are going to let me come up to lurgan for study days and let me hang out in the cool church building (conviniently situated downstairs from a coffee shop!)     to conclude...just so happy. happier than i thought i could be.

      will be good! i've got a really great feeling about what i can achieve...although i've been moaning about my revision, it paid off as i now have a quarter of my chemistry and my history gcse work done already! so now i can have two weeks off in italy, should be fab. well, except i've been instructed to bring "macbeth", one of my english lit. books,  but i like shakesphere and i can just read it on the plane. :-) all my schoolwork seems so manegable now. and this is my last year at the royal, hapy days! i'm looking forward to tech. i've locked myself in my room with my guitar for 3 days now and i can play the whole of the oasis "what's the story" album, some ash, bic runga, tasmin archer, the coral, starsailor, and lots more. bliss. tomorrow i'm going to a dance thingy with nat. i'm not exactly looking forward to it...i like dancing, but i'm so bad at it! i shall fall over and whack my head off something, i know it. still, at least everyone will get a good laugh. i bought ash, intergalactic sonic 7's today, it's really good. hmm...anything else...it's hard to blog in the summer cos nothing much happens! baptism-wise, steph says there should be no prob. with me getting baptised even though i'm not a member of their church. now all i have to do is hope they pick a date i'm not on holiday on. and ask mum and dad. keep meaning to, then putting it off... anyway, that's it really. just hanging around the house eating giant cookies and watching tv. saw edward scissorhands the other day, which is now my favourite film, i loved it. cried buckets though. not really thinking that many deep philisophical thoughts as my brain is worn out from revision. the most intellectual stimulation i can cope with at the moment is fireman sam. i actually saw an episode recently which raised some very interesting questions about ethics and sexism. cebeebies is an excellent television channel, i feel. who needs the proms on bbc4 when you have chris and his guitar, singing "i am the music man" in the blue door hour between 3 and 4? genius. also there is the carrot club, featuring beebie and bracken, the cebeebies rabbits. now how does the song go again...*switches off ash to concentrate* "what is in the carrot cupboard, i don't know, do you?" is all i can remember at the minute. speaking of songs, the end of summer school,( a kids club i did) service on sunday night had the most appalling children's chorus i've ever heard. the tune was crap, dull as hell, the words were crap...  "O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E obedience is the very best way to show that you believe"  and there was another line that urged you to be like jesus, "sweetly submitting to authority"...don't think so! almost as bad as "gentle jesus, meek and mild". yeah right!

      just watched it again with my mother, and it is confirmed: i love it! however, mum thinks this film is crap. along with everyone else i've asked. surely someone else must like it?  today i had to do yet more revision *groan* also watched the film "holes" with my sister. surprisingly good. :-)  lately i've been too tired to pray or read my bible much, which i feel guilty about. i know it doesn't have any effect on my salvation or whatever, but i don't want to move away from god or anything. the wierd thing is though, i feel closer to him than ever. it's like before god only came to visit, whenever i prayed or read the bible he arrived and then left. now it feels like he's always there, with me. i talk to him a lot, but i'm unwilling to catergorise this as "prayer" as that implies praying seriously for vital issues, like world hunger or something, not chatting aimlessely away to god about everything that comes into my head, as i do now. "prayer" makes me think fasting and candles and contemplative music, not me sitting in my pyjamas in front of the telly yattering away about what i think of the guitar solo in this song. speaking of guitar, guess who can play blur "country house"? i love this song and i finally got the chords! :-D
