      圆月夜  二月十五，深夜，月圆。这不但是狼儿对天长吼的时候，也是一个人的寿命即将要结束的时候。 荒野的草地上，一滴一滴的血和汗，从一个身穿新郎服的人身上流下。这人赫然就是云南十四侠里排行第十二的燕飞云。受了重创的他，狂奔着，正在逃避一个人的追杀，狼狈不堪。 到底是谁有那么大的能耐把他重创如此？那不是什么人，只是一个无名的杀手。 过了一会儿，他终于不支倒下，整个人扑倒在地上。他不但失血过多，也没有力气再跑了。因为自从在婚礼中遇袭，然后被这个杀手追杀开始，他已经狂奔了将近四个时辰。 燕飞云缓缓地站了起来，回过头一望，发现人影也没有半个，心里冷静下来，喘着气叹道：“应该甩下他了吧……” 但可惜人生不如意，十有八九。当他再次回过头，那个杀手就站在他面前。其实不应该叫站，应该叫飘。因为他的双腿离地三寸有多。他出神入化的轻功也可想而知。 发现还是被他跟上了，燕飞云惊愕万分，颤抖着的双腿情不自禁地向后一步一步的退，但不小心被一颗石头绊倒了，整个人倒下。 因为光线不足，燕飞云根本看不见这杀手的脸孔，只看见他藏在袖里的双手正在闪闪发亮。 他望着那杀手道：“我们云南十四侠到底跟你有何仇怨，你为何先杀掉我十三和十四弟，然后追杀我？” 那杀手开口了，但可能是因为做杀手的人早就抛弃了自己的感情吧，所以他的声音里藏着万分冷意：“没有理由。因为我是杀手，有人以高价聘请我杀人，我就必须杀掉那个人，而那个人也绝对活不过两个月。” 他继续道：“所以，既然有人以高价聘请我去杀掉云南十四侠，我就必须杀掉你们，而且一个不留。” 燕飞云问道：“难道你杀人就只是为了金钱？无论好人坏人你都一样会杀？” 杀手道：“没错。这就是我的工作。” 燕飞云的双眼已布满血丝：“果然是一个名副其实的杀手……高姓大名？” 杀手道：“姓名早已遗忘，别号泣魂。” 燕飞云叹道：“好一个泣魂……” 泣魂问道：“你还有问题吗？” 燕飞云握紧拳头道：“应该没有了……”说到‘了’字时，他突然一个跟斗翻起，一拳击向泣魂的脑袋，大叫道：“拼了！” 但泣魂好像早就知道他会这样做，左手一闪，挡住他的拳头，再右手一闪，燕飞云还没看清他的兵器便倒下了。 燕飞云死时眼睛还是瞪得大大的。因为其实他的疑问还很多。到底是谁派这个杀手来的？这杀手到底是何方神圣？这杀手到底用的是什么兵器？ 泣魂望着燕飞云的尸体黯然道：“我知道在拜堂成亲之时突然暴死荒野是一个十分残酷的现实。但是这只能怪你选错时间成亲……” 他沉默了一会儿，然后一字一字道：“因为我杀人一向都在月圆之夜……” 这时已是凌晨时分。一个冷酷的杀手带着深不可测的武功和燕飞云的尸体慢慢地消失在漆黑中……
