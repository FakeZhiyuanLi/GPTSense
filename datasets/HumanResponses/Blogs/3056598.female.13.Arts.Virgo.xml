        BREMEN    shUt uP my InNerjEsus  ---------------------------------  Has anyone read the comic Bremen. Awesome, it's japan thing but don't shut it out cause of that. It's more american independent kinda thing. It's about 4 guys starting a band to be gods of rock. One is this extremise who's going to find his dream. the other Reji has a huge red mowhawk and wants to be a musician he's bit over passinate about his dream and sensable but i love him anyway. 3rd is a crossdresser Ryo he/she is the drummer he's .... got problems ... but is really entertaining.last is ran the bass player. he's the oldest of the group and thought of the name Bremen for the band. He was in some drug cult thing. The whole comic was mostly molded around punk rock and give a vibe of Tank Girl ( movie not comic). If you look up Toriyama's world you'll go to manga and download the comic i genrally like it though it has it's flaws. If you hate it well then well ...fuck you.

       BEHAVE, AND BEALIVE IS THE MISSION   shUt uP my InNerjEsus #2  ------------------------------------------ Human nature is a strange thing , no? Have you ever been a kid. They can never find the one thing that can make them whole. They can never say that their happy at where there at now. Selling out has a big thing to it. something beutiful but not past their lovely morals. Hey, let's find someplace that won't say no.

      shUt uP my InNerjEsus ---------------------------- ANDREW WAS OUT OF IT TODAY JUST LIKE ME HE WAS JUST SORTA FLOATING.MONTANA LOST HER  NEW YEARBOOK TO SOME BITCH ASS PORTORICAIN.   AS FOR ME I WAS JUST SORTA STARING AT THE SUN IF I SEEM BLEAK YOU WOULD BE CORRECT. TODAY WAS JUST LIKE THAT SONG FROM OFFSPRING  (damn caps lock)   offspring staring at the sun     Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing It brings me down, but I won't let them  If I seem bleak Well you'd be correct And if I don't speak It's cause I can't disconnect But I won't be burned by the reflection Of the fire in your eyes As you're staring at the sun   When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away There's more to living than only surviving Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying   Though you hear me I don't think that you relate  My will is something That you can't confiscate So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated By destruction in your eyes As you're staring at the sun  trully felt that way today it might be my fault that nobody really understands the fcat that i'm trying but i guess it's my fault i'm not representing my feelings well enough. you ever get the feeling that your completly cut off. like everyone has some sort of dream but you don't have squat. Some peoples dream is to have a dream. do you really have enough time to do that look for a dream and find it and then start at it from there it could take awhile but i guess just finding it would be the funiest right ... i guess my dream is to have more fun than anyone else. fun  what a stupid word.   *today's haikus*  In the corridor he's walking past my front door he's hating even more  In the corridor he's pent up in the pent house he's forgetting more  In the corridor he's scared of the next open door he trembles even more  I'd give him a shove but he might mistake the love so i wave from shore        --------- alternate ending     I'm watching him go with parents i don't really know but i'm trusting them

       WENSEDAY TO THURSDAY  shUt uP my InNerjEsus  ---------------------------     Wenseday, I went to see my dear friend play at this pub Will's Pub. He started a band and got a gig this kids only 13 years old. It was a great performance he was best of the 3 bands also playing. ( not including his lil' brother playing the harmonica which was adorable ). All together I'm jealous of his pursuit to music, but I also admire it.        Afterward , we went back to Montana's house and mostly watched " that 70's show" and spewed chocolate syrup out of our mouth because I brought up that be cause the movie phyco was black and white they used chocolate syrup instead of fake blood so it was coming.     But it doesn't stop there at about 4:00 in the morning ( still watching that 70's show ) we saw this huge pile of brownies on TV and montana's just like " I .... Want ..... Brownies ". The next day we walk 4 miles to publix, walk 4 miles back and make a ass load of brownies and ate them in one sitting and it was delicious   THE END

        PROTECT YOUR NUTS    shUt uP my InNerjEsus --------------------------------     Recently I went to the beach. Big hotel. friends came with me. hotel room looking over the hot tub where digusting fat hairy Italian men hung out at. Well, luckly every once and awhile a good looking boy will be in there. Kiwi ( not her real name ) a boy crazy slut of a cousin, decide hey look theres a good looking guy in the spa. Me who also thought the boy to be good looking but also one of the biggest socially inapt guy I've seen here meaning intrest was small for me. But hey bad table manners won't stop kiwi ( which is also probally the reason she's had lots of boyfriends and i havn't had one ... I'm such a bitch ).   I'm eating nut out of a can and kind just watching him. Kiwi tries to get him to notice by knocking the nuts out of my hands ( just to pour some ) to bad i'm a butter fingers and drop the whole can. " MY NUTS YOU BITCH " Kiwi laughing ran to the other room. I chased her screaming MY NUTS! When we decided to go back to the balcony the hot board shorted boy was pissed. Nuts had gone every where. " You hurt that boy " he yells up at us. I look and there's this little boy holding his eye.  oh fuck. the dad was pretty pissed too.                    that day we learned that trying to get a boy's attention with a can of nuts is fun intill one hits some random boy in the eye.

       WALK AWAY ME BOYS,    as my eyesight fades like that old song.    shUt uP my InNerjEsus  ----------------------------------   &nbsp; This is yesterday, humor me bobby sue. I stroll over to my friends 13th birthday ........ She likes to pretend she's turning 2 , that was the theme, though she called it rainbow theme, I think.   Montana has the habit of picking things out 10 times earlier than it happens, She said " Even with a party of like 10 people there's clicks" me thinking that this was pure superstition thought "nah, people only hate eachother till they met".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the story goes untold.   Toward the end of the party cake was introduced to the lil' punklings.  The smearing began. I walk into the bathroom where there was already one in progress between, heather and evelin. I throw Dr. Pepper at Evelin as Heather ran out.  We shut the door thinking oh shit somebodies gonna hate us for this and blame is for squares ( Really the Dr. Pepper looked like someone had the runs ) .WE grab toilet pepper and just confitty it everywhere intill Evelin accidentally drops the toilet roll into the toilet. We look for the and extra could only find tampons in my mind I'm just like " Oh god wouldn't that be funny".   In the end the mess soaked up and deposed of in a decent manor ( only a few tampons were used).   And when people barged in demanding what the 2 of us were doing I said " uuuuh we were just making out".&nbsp;   &nbsp;   If lifes not&nbsp;beautiful without the pain, then&nbsp;I rather never ever see beauty ever again.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Modest Mouse

       A clockwork orange    shUt uP my InNerjEsus ------------------------------------  Yeah I watched that. loved it. almost barfed. i danced. i listened to 73 1/2 of Alex's rambeling. and in the end i converted over to being jewish for no aparent reason.  For those who don't know "a clockwork orange" is an old 70's flick about a young boy who is charmingly insane. With his chums he rids the world of guzzeling bums. And rape's women like atela the hun.   But oh it's nothing done if he was not picked up by cops  But he is for what he does and going to the pictures never made him oh so sick.    This is one film thats hard to relate to so it's increrdabliy strange.And rated X. .................. i highly recomended it
