      The past two days have been complete hell. Friday night was dress rehersal. I left my house at 4 and didnt get home until close to 11. Dress rehersal was awful. It was by far the worst dress rehersal I have been to in my life. It was so long and everyone was so tired. The dances looked like we had just learned them and there was so much drama I couldn't stand it. The next day was recital. We had two shows, one and 1, and the other at 6. Well the first show we were doing ok, there was little drama but everyone was very tired. During Trapped, my most favorite dance, other than my modern solo, was going very good. Then the music guy bumped something and our music stopped and then started over from the begining. Regardless of this, we all stayed together perfectly and you couldnt tell that anything had gone wrong. We were all pleased by this, as was jenn. This is Jenn's first recital on her own, o we wanted to make it the best one ever. I think we did a good job of that. Then during Keep it in the Closet, which is the dance that all of us know needs work, the music started fine, but the lights didn't come on, so were dancing in the dark for about two counts of eight and when the lights came on, everyone was facing different dirrections. That show got done around 4ish and lasted much longer than the two and a half hours that was predicted. So for thesnd show we all hd about 45 minutes to go get something to eat and come back and do yet another show. This show was much more fun because I got to do my modern solo which i love more than anything. Modern, basically, the only part of dance I enjoy anymore. But anyways, Mike was getting tired and was having trouble doing all the lifts. But all the dances ran smoothly, except when they lost my music for my solo. But I was with Mike most of the night. God I love that boy. He is so funny. I think that the highlight of the night was def. this:  Alex: everyone loves mike, the whole show is based around him Me: that's because this is the boy (saying this as a put my arm around him) Mike: (mike then puts both his arms around my stomach and says,) and this is the girl. she is my jungle indian and she dies and then i am sad.  I guess it was one of those "you had to be there" kind of things. But none the less, it was funny. After the recital I couldnt move. I have bruises everywhere and my back is in horrible condition. I did something to one of the muscles in my left leg so everytime I walk it hurts and everytime I put any pressure on my right knee that hurts. I hate being hurt all the time.

      I'm 15 for a moment Caught in between 10 and 20  And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are 15 there's still time for you  Time to buy and time to lose 15, there's never a wish better than this 15 there's still time for you Time to buy, Time to lose yourself  Within a morning star 15 I'm all right with you 15, there's never a wish better than this...  Drunken mistakes...yes, I have been making quite a few of these recently. Well, one, and I regret that night the most. I really don't know what happened. I hurt someone too, when I wasn't thinking. damn. I feel awful. I have been doing things that I know are wrong and I still do them rgardless of who I hurt in the process. So far this summer, I am not happy with some of my choices and all I want right now is to be able to take those things back and start over. Start the whole summer over. I wish...  I have been extremly stressed out this entire week, and now that it's the weekend, it isn't getting much better. Last night was dress rehersal. I left home at 4 and got home at around 10:30ish. Well, dress rehersal, I am lost for words, so many tears it was pathetic and I swear if one more person ass me why I am not doing company next year I will fucking explode. hmm

       Tuesday Morning Hello   Well baby it seems you're my Monday night lack of sleep; Tuesday morning hello. And something about the smell of bonfire and rain and stale beer in my clothes makes something inside me smile. All these crazy teenage moments something that I will forever hold on to. Especially when I finally sleep on a Monday night and the smell of stale beer is no longer something I'm accustomed to. A Tuesday morning hello is something I will always have from you. And that early morning sun laced with fireflies and the scent of dew and cigarettes Those tiny stars still glowing like they have something to prove. And when I think of our talks and how I can lose myself in those portals to your soul And there is just something about how you hold yourself and the way your face seems to change when looking at me I really have no words to say. I can barely keep my eyes open, but somehow your head against my chest keeps me from falling asleep. Listen to my heartbeat, I'll hold you while you sleep, the fireflies will dance and I will watch your mouth fill your lungs with life's breath Hoping that a part of me is in your fragile lungs Sleep softly, and on Tuesday morning it will be hello Something for me to give to you that may seem like nothing but will mean everything to me watch that sleepy sun cast away the darkness, glowing blue on everyone around us sleeping soundly Beer and cigarettes, pointless jokes and teenage party politics, endless talks and a beautiful sunrise, it is now Tuesday morning, hello.  this is something, someone wrote. I wish I knew who wrote it so I could give them credit. I really like this poem because it reminds me so much of my life. I love life right now, more than ever.

      What to say? I have so much to say, yet I can't find the words or time to say it all. Lately I have been thinking a lot. Thinking seems to have overpowered me. I have been questioning a lot of the things I have been doing. I know a lot of these things are wrong..but, I do them anyway. These past two days have been the best ever. They were filled with craziness and I love it. It's finally summer, and it's only three days in and I'm already having so much fun. I am throughly enjoying not having to do anything for an entire month before I go back to the life I can't stand. In a month I will be returning to dance. This is something that I would usually loook forward to, but not this year. I have decided to quit company and I tried to quit completely, but no, that just wasn't going to happen. I am not happy about being forced to do something I have no desire to do. I am too stubborn for my own good. I am kind of dredding going back. It's going to be weird now, just taking regular classes and doing solos. Everyone keeps asking me why I quit and I can't help but get fustrated becuase I hear it so often now. I am tired of only doing one thing. Dance has been a huge part of my life, well, all of my life for so long that I have never had the chance to do other things. This was partially my fault for not wanting to try new things because dance is like a comfort zone to me. It's all I have ever done and I am staring to accept the fact that I am good, so why do anything else? Although this year I have become completely fustrated with everyone and everything. Well, hopefully that wont happen anymore and everyone can just shut up and dance.

      Yesterday... Yesterday, I went to my in-studio rehersal and we were all talking about how I have issues with "relatonships." The word "relationships" is in quotes, because, well, we all know that I can't stay in one for too long. Talking with light-hearted Mike yesterday seemed to make anything that had gone completely wrong yesterday ok. We were disscussing the fact that I will never get married or have children because, one, I hate little children at times. The can be so sweet and innocent until you forget to feed them or give them a nap and then they become horrible little terrors, and two, because of this "relationship" problem I seem to have. I know that I am only 15, but I have never really been one to want relationship status. Hook ups and being "together" with someone without the title of being someone's girlfriend. Yea that's what I miss. I don't miss being someone's girlfriend because I honestly never cared for the title much and I will never miss it. I will never again want that title.  Sometimes, I really love my mom. Like yesterday, for once we were talking without yelling at each other, and lately, that hasn't happened too often, so I enjoyed it. She told me something that I swore I would pay attention too. Well, I did, and what she told me was really smart and I wanted to remember it because it sounded like it would make a good away message or quote for my profile or something of that nature, but I guess I couldn't have listened too well because, the only thing I remember her telling me is that I'm too stubborn for my own good. This is the most true thing I have heard from anyone in awhile. Once I say that I wont do something, I wont and there is no way to make me. It doesn't matter what it is, or who I hurt in the process, I never change my mind, ven if it is the deciding factor in making me the happiest person in the world. I never change my mind. That is one of my biggest faults.

      Today was one of those days when you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I love days like this. On the plus, it is beautiful outside and I love this warm weather and the fact that I am out of school and now a sophomore. It is unbelieveable how fast this year went by and I am still blown away by some of the things that happened. One very good thing that happened to me this year was Brett. We always had our rocky spots but we had our good times too. I will miss him. So this is my apology. I never meant to hurt you by any of the things i said. You have to understand that when I, or anyone for that matter, is upset, they say things they dont mean. I have tendencys to lash out at times when I feel vulnerable. The only reason I said half of those things is so that I can get over you because I know that we will never be more than just friends now, if thats even possible after what I said and did. But I truely am sorry, so please accept this apology. I am sorry that is the way I am and Im sorry for handeling things the way I did. Sometimes,I take things the wrong way, this was one of those things. I do understand your reason for it and I accept that. So I am sorry, I hope that you forgive me, and if not, well then at least I have learned a lesson.   When I think of what i've done. All the pain that I brung.Baby you should've walked out on me. And when I turned away from you whenever there were hard times.How could you still be with me? And there is no mistake when I hurt you that day. And when I was somebody new I should've been mad at you. Baby it breaks my heart to think that lovin' me is not easy to do. And I don't mean to make it hard. Sorry for all the changes I put you through...

       Time for an actual entry and not just lyrics.    &nbsp;  Last night i started dance again and i was happy to be back, but i could have done without the cold shoulder bit but there is nothing i can do about that at this point. you would think that after leaving people would realise that they take people for granted and miss them, but no. yes,&nbsp;almost everyone said that they would miss me, but thats hard to believe. all i got out of anyone last night was "hi" or "have you&nbsp;been here the whole time, well hi" and im not complaining or anything, but i can't help but feel isolated. i dont know if anyone there truely misses me, other than alyssa frey who was very happy to see me. Alex and Missy were happy to see me too. I dont feel close to any of the girls anymore. basically, i feel like im standing alone in a world where i never had to before. this is a cold world with few familiar faces. i dont know anyone anymore. how is it that i had more converation with the parents then my  friends.     &nbsp;  Yea, and im not doing company either and i dont regret it at all. the only thing i think i'll miss is modern. last year a lot of people gave it their all just to have people complain about it all, whil others kind of slacked off some. but im glad i dont have to deal with any of that drama. i still have my solos. and speaking of solos, i started my lyric solo. its called "that i would be good" i love it a lot and its vry hard, especially since i havent danced in a month and here i am being thrown so quickly into it all. but for once, im actually happy. im happy to be there an to just be dancing. i miss the closeness i had with the girls but i dont miss the drama. im dancing for me ths year. finally i am going to do it for me and not do it for them. i can finally focus on me instead of having to worry about groups and not letting everyone else down. ahhh some time to breath. some time for me...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Here. A little sympathy for you to waste on me I know you're faking it but that's okay And I don't want to drag it out Don't want to bring you down I never wanted it to end this way Even if I wanted to I don't think that I'd get to you There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again    Here. A little jealousy I hope you think of me Hope you wonder where I sleep at night Cause I feel like I'm inside out You got me upside down Maybe I was holding on too tight    Even if I wanted to  I don't think that I'd get to you There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again So don't just say goodbye to me Just turn your back away and leave And if you're lucky I will be your last regret, your only friend    The two of us we dream like one The two of us, the two of us The two of us take breath like one The two of us, the two of us    I guess that this is over now I guess it's called the falling out But everyday I'm learning how to make it through this life I'm in    Even if I wanted to I don't think that I'd get to you There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again    So don't just say goodbye to me Just turn your back away and leave And if you're lucky I will be your last regret, your only friend    &nbsp;  ahh yellowcard. i love them so much.

      It took me by surprise When I saw you standing there Close enough to touch Breathing the same air You asked me how I'd been I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine Oh but baby I was lying  What I really meant to say Is I'm dying here inside I miss you more each day There's not a night I haven't cried And baby here's the truth I'm still in love with you That's what I really meant to say  And as you walked away The echo of my words Cut just like a knife Cut so deep it hurt I held back the tears Held on to my pride And watched you go I wonder if you'll ever know  What I really meant to say Is I'm dying here inside I miss you more each day There's not a night I haven't cried And baby here's the truth I'm still in love with you That's what I really meant to say  What I really meant to say Is I'm really not that strong No matter how I try I'm still holding on And here's the honest truth I'm still in love with you That's what I really meant to say

      I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and all your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday

      It's so simple and complicated.  The way you can  crush  me.  No matter how much this hurts, this is through.  I get as far as your door before i get caught.  I make up excuses just to touch you and I can't stop, I can't stop.   So are we playing for keeps? These days begin and they don't end for weeks.  left out of anyting to do with you.  Excuse me while I fall apart.  Don't flatter yourself sweetheart.  Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car.  Why do you have to make this so hard?   You're so good at pretending everything is alright.   You're as welcome as cancer, but my door is always unlocked.   So are we playing for keeps? These days begin and they don't end for weeks.  left out of anyting to do with you.  Excuse me while I fall apart.  Don't flatter yourself sweetheart.  Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car.   Why do you have to make this so hard?    .x.matchbook.x. .x.romance.x.

      And there's a place you'll always be No matter where you are You're here with me When the world is turning upside down Together we can stand our ground We can even say goodbye for now if If that's what we have to do But here in my heart Even when my arms are empty darlin' I'm still holdin' on to you...  --------------------------------------  Now the things that will haunt him Until the day that he dies Is the smell of cheap whiskey And the sound of goodbye...  --------------------------------------  How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far  There's a chance I could change my mind But I won't, not till you decide What you want, what you need Do you even care if I stay or leave what's it gonna be?  --------------------------------------  I don't want to see you 'Cause I don't want to feel you I don't want a love that I can't win baby I don't want you to call 'Cause if I can't have it all I don't want to see you again  When your new life gets you down Don't be tempted to come around Just think of all the times I let you slide And when your teardrops finally come You'll realize that I'm the one But I won't be there when it's your turn to cry...

      On a dark desert highway  Cool wind in my hair  Warm smell of colitas  Rising up through the air  Up ahead in the distance  I saw a shimmering light  My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim  I had to stop for the night  There she stood in the doorway  I heard the mission bell  And I was thinking to myself   This could be  Heaven  or this could be  Hell    Then she lit up a candle  And she showed me the way  There were voices down the corridor  I thought I heard them say   Welcome to the Hotel California  Such a lovely place  Such a lovely place  Such a lovely face  Plenty of room at the Hotel California  Any time of year  Any time of year  You can find it here  You can find it here   Her mind is Tiffany twisted  She's got the Mercedes bends  She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys  That she calls friends  How they dance in the courtyard  Sweet summer sweat  Some dance to  remember   Some dance to  forget   So I called up the Captain  Please bring me my wine  He said  We haven't had that spirit here since 1969  And still those voices are calling from far away  Wake you up in the middle of the night  Just to hear them say   Welcome to the Hotel California  Such a lovely Place  Such a lovely Place  Such a lovely face  They're livin' it up at the Hotel California  What a nice surprise  What a nice surprise  Bring your alibies   Mirrors on the ceiling  Pink champagne on ice  And she said   We are all just prisoners here  Of our own device   And in the master's chambers  They gathered for the feast  They stab it with their steely knives  But they just can't kill the beast  Last thing I remember  I was running for the door  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before  Relax said the nightman  We are programed to recieve  You can check out any time you like  But you can never leave

      Complete and total adoration My gift to you, my heart was yours In Ten weeks you shaped it, in one night you murdered it Torn from my chest and laid at your feet,  That first step that you took was the worst. Since then you've walked a thousand miles in solace and short remark And I still have these memories, But we will never see what we could have been. Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?  Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go? Rememeber, 'cause thats all you can do. We'll never make another memory, We'll never make another memory. I wish I would have died in your arms the last time we were together, So I wouldn't have to wake without you today. This time I thought things were real, You said they were, What happened? You were a priority, was I an option? I let you see a side of me I don't share with anyone. Promises are just word unless they are fulfilled. Knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart, I'm sorry that it wasn't enough. So, we'll go our own ways, And hopefully you'll remember these things I've told you, Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said is in sincerity. A broken heart is not what I wanted from this,  But I guess I've learned from it. But aren't you supposed to learn from your mistakes? I don't consider this a mistake, I just wish the story didn't end this way, 'Cause I'm still in love with the person helped me write it. Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go? Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now? ~Across Five Aprils - A Year From Now

      Alaina47: I MISSSSSSSS YOUUUUUUUU :-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-(:-( LilDancer2525: aww i miss you too LilDancer2525: but u'll see me soon Alaina47: i hope soooo LilDancer2525: ill still be there for regular classes Alaina47: goood LilDancer2525: and u'll have classes with me so u'll see me EVERY week Alaina47: THANK FUCKING GOD.....im sooo lonely without you...i have noone to share stories with LilDancer2525: lol oh have i got stroies for you when i get back   yea there are some people from the studio that i miss...others i could do without seeing again. but either way i am excited to be getting back, just to REGULAR classes, with no pressure. i am extremely excited to start my solos. i have a feeling that they are going to be amazing this year, because i have every intention of practicing my solos, seeing as i wont have the pressure of company to deal with. ahh this should be a nice break from the long hours i put in at the studio which will make me happier, along with other reasons. i am glad that i chose this way, i mean before i was in a lot of groups and other people were dependant on me to make them look good so i busted my butt for those and didnt care about my solos. im not saying that i should be the other way around, but i really think that my solos desrve more attention, bc they are for me, and they make me happy, and im sure i will love them. Jenn is changing my "style" for lyrical this year, hopefully none of that light and fluffy stuff, i cant stand light and fluffy, its not me..thats all for now. ill update later..

      hm today was yet another lazy day filled with me doing nothing. i have no clue how i am about to tell yo about my day because nothing very interesting happened. i felt very immature today, almost as if i was five again, and yes, people do say that i am an immature five year old, but i'm really not. and considering this comment also came from the same by who called me a beached whale it must not be soo true. but today i took my time while doing things, for example, it took me much longer to eat dinner today than it usually does. instead of devouring my food in the normal 5 minutes, i would say it took double that. and i played outside and blew bubbles. :-D i love blowing bubbles, but it does make me feel quite childish, and it's summer, so i don't really mind. it is beautiful out today. it is going to be such a beautful night, unlike last night which was rainy and i didnt like it. so seeing as i did practically nothing all day, i am going to make a character's list (a characters list is a list, obviously lol)of everyone i love and adore!   Brett: he is my most recent ex boyfriend,although we are broken up we still remain good "friends", even though we got into a fight. brett is one of the most beautiful boys i have ever seen and i love him.  Brandon: this is brett's twin brother, at times, i think he hates me. but what can you do about it?  Monica: she is one of my bestest friends in the whole world! Like me, she dances, has long hair, and is polish. we have very fun times when we are together. she is very pretty and very tan right now, you could say she was black, but people think that she is Puerto Rican and not polish, but i love her dearly, we go every where together.  Meghan: i love meghan. we have had some good times, even though i just met her this year. meghan is very white, like me, and she has blonde hair and blue eyes. sometimes she says stupi things and i think its funny so we just laugh at her and tell her that sheis blonde. she also dances, which i love.   Jordan: jordan is short, but so i am, so its not a bad thing. she has very long hair,even longer than mine and it is very thick. people call her a midgit which i think is funny. she is very crazy and runs around all the time.  Nora: nora plays basketball and she is very good. she is kinda short too,now that i think about it. actully we are all very short, so never mind. she has light brown hair and hei very pretty. she is another crazy one, but notas crazy as jordan.  Nick: yet another ex boyfriend of mine. we dnt get along. neither do him and brett. nick lives in south hadley. he is greek.  Mike: oh just thinking about mike makes me smile. he is very funny. i love dancing with him. he has brown hair and brown eyes.he makes me laugh.  julie: we are dance partners, she is tiny and has curly hair. i dont feel as close with her this year as i did before and now he is leaving.  jessica: she has very long legs and is very tall. she is an amazing dancer and i am jealous of her. i dont feel as close with her this year as i did before.  jenna: jenna is my age and is beautiful. not fair. she also dances  ahh there are so many more but i am tired of doing this...maybe ill add more later. i still ahve to describe ally, jenn, aber, danielle, the alshley's, alaina, the alexs', oh so many people to go...

       hands down   Breathe in for  luck , breathe in so  deep , this air is  blessed , you share with me. This night is  wild , so  calm  and  dull , these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy.  My heart is yours  to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that  your kiss might kill me . So won't you kill me,  so I die happy . My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down  this is the best day I can ever remember ,   I'll always remember   the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you  kissed  me like you meant it.  And I knew that you meant it , that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it,   that you meant it.     screaming infidelities   I'm missing your bed, I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak & this bottle of beast is taking me home. I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets You're not alone & you're not discreet. Make sure I know who's taking you home. I'm reading your note over again. Theres not a word that I comprehend,  except when you signed it "I'll love you always & forever" Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs,  and sit alone and wonder... how you're making out. But as for me I wish that I was anywhere... With anyone... making out I'm missing your laugh, how did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake?  I hope you're as happy as your pretending  Im cuddling close to blanket and sheets I am alone in my defeat I wish I knew you were ***SAFELY*** at home I'm missing your bed, I never sleep. Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak. And this bottle of Beast is taking me home. Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs,  and sit alone and wonder... how you're making out. But as for me I wish that I was anywhere... With anyone... making out Your hair. It's everywhere. Screaming infidelities. And taking its wear. Your hair. It's everywhere. Screaming infidelities. And taking its wear. Your hair. It's everywhere. Screaming infidelities. And taking its wear. Your hair. It's everywhere. Screaming infidelities. And taking its wear.  ahh Dashboard..

      Time Goes, slowly now, in my life Fear, no more, of what, I'm not sure Searching to feel your soul, The strength to stand alone The power of not knowing, and letting go...  I guess I've found my way It's simple when it's right Feeling lucky just be here, tonight And  happy , Just to be me, And be...Alive  Love In and out, of my, my heart And though life, can be strange, I can't, be afraid Searching to feel your soul, The strength to stand alone, The power of not knowing and letting go.  alive   I guess it's all there for the takin' I think it's all yours & mine My preacher says I got to see it to believe it & l believe Won't sleep till I've had enough I believe won't sip my wine from no paper cup I believe won't sleep till I've had enough  Delicious Surprise Now I do believe No fear in my eyes Now I can see  Heaven's inside inside inside I knew it all the time  Got me somethin to believe in  but all I really want now is a handful of salvation   delicious suprise

      today is such a lazy day. i awoke at 11 o'clock and made myslef scrambled eggs and toast. yum. i didnt eat any lunch, prehaps because i was way too lazy to do so. i went online for a couple hours before i signed off and went to go watch t.v. i talked to a few people, had a couple interesting coversations and thats pretty much it. i have done nothing all day so far and really have no intention of doing anything either. i have been sitting around watching t.v and eating all day. how fun. now i'm back online and there is no one to talk to. today, monica and i were supposed to go to the beach, but the weather is shitty. i am pissed. i love the beach and would have been thrilled to have my twin go with me. i hate the rain sometimes. i am very bored and dont know what to do with myself. i think that next time i write an entry it will be in all spanish. haha yea maybe not.   "A man realized he wanted his love back. Not wanting to get hurt, the girl said 'No.' The man cried to God and asked, 'If it is meant to be, why did I lose her?' God replied 'My child, you didn't lose her. You let her go...'"  i really like that quote, reminds me of someone. hmmm

      well, i'm in the mood to write today. i'm not really sure why, but i am. certain things with a certain person are fixed and i am  very  happy about this. i dont like it when things get messed up between me and this person. in other new, this came as a shock to me, i recieved news from an old boyfriend of mine and he told me that he still liked me. we started going out in december and we broke up sometime in january. i said some very mean things to him and we stopped talking. then one day we started talking again, not a lot like we used to but at least we were getting along. then today he tells me that he still likes me. i found this hard to believe bc i was very mean to this particular boyfriend. hmm we broke up in january and now it's july, so its been 7 months since we have been broken up and he still likes me. weird and a total shock. what am i supposed to do about this? especially since i like someone else and he knows i like someone else and when i talk to him i know that he likes me. oh man...lost for words  i have only hd this blog since june so i feel the need to catch everyone else up on some of the highlights from before. like the freshman dance. this was by far one of the most exciting days in may and i loved it! i had a very wonderful date who i care about very much and i was there with allof my friends. at first i was kinda bored but as the night went on it got better. this is one of my favorite pictures from the night... urlLink   this is the party crew (some inside joke between some of us freshman, now sophomores)were not really a party crew anymore though. that's kind of over now. we still have fun though. everyone had a lot of fun  that night. mmmmhhhmmm lots of fun! i love the class of 2007

      And what's one more sleepless night? laying awake in bed wishing  that everything was alright but nothing is ok I lay awake thinking of the awful things I've done and hoping for forgiveness, which I fear will never come I guess that now it's too late  And these words roll around in my head and these fears and dreams Searching for a way to get to you To let you know I'm sorry  I can't take back those things I said no matter how hard I try things will never be alright so instead I lie awake in bed thinking over the things you said  I know that I hurt you there is nothing left to say a single tear rolls down my cheek this could be goodbye forever my heart begins to weap So what's one more sleepless night?   just something i wrote, right now. been feeling really bad lately. and there is nothing anyone could say or do to make me feel any better. i messed up, and this time, i think that i wont be forgiven.   How am I supposed to feel About the things I've done I don't know if I should stay Or turn around and run I know that I hurt you;  Things will never be the same The only love I ever knew I threw it all away ~yellowcard  ^ also something that relates to how i feel right now.

      i havent written in a long time. i guess thats because i really havent had anything to say, until now. before i go into the long tedious story of what i did wrong now i just have a few things to point out:  sleepovers are crazy. i dont care who they are with..they are crazy. me monica and meg had one last night. haha movies and such. lots of food, good times. i ran into a tree haha and what was with the push ups? but despite the mood i was in yesterday(good and bad)i did something very very very dumb and i regret every word i said. i wish that i could take it all back but i cant. all i can do now is apoligize and hope that things work out ok. i really dont know how people put up with me when i get like i did last night. and i really dont understand why they do. i feel absolutely awful right now. i cant wait to get away..to just leave all this behind and not have to think about it for awhile. 3 days away will be good for me. maybe i get some sanity back and stop doing such stupid things. ok so here i go again. yet another apology for yet another stupid drunken mistake, but for the same person.   dear friend,     yes, friend, thats what we were and for now i dont know what we are. this could fall apart and it will be all my fault. yes, in times like these i do not look on the bright side, i just dwell on the negative, and what else would i do? there is no positivity to anything i said last night. i know that you are probally sick of hearing this all the time, and lately you have been getting a few of these, so i am going to try my hardest so i dont have to do this anymore. all the things i said, i didnt mean, another drunken mistake that i made, that happened to hurt you..again. this hurts me too, more than you could know. i dont show it all the time but a lot of the things i do hurt me. well i guess what i am trying to get around to is that im sorry. please know that i feel awful inside and its showing on the outside. i will understand if you want to end things for good this time. it makes sense, afterall, how many times have i screwed up? too many to count. but you wont have to hear any of this self-pity anymore. if thats what you want, then i guess i'll just have to live with it. its been a rough road and until now we were doing fine, but i guess this could be where the road ends for us. these are my final words for now and a temporary goodbye...

       have you ever noticed how the days pass so slowly when you are so eager for something to come? i have noticed this and it is just about driving me nuts. this wait for school to start, yes thats right, school, is driving me crazy. i cant wait to go back and to see everyone. it's a new year, a fresh start. and i swear that i am going to do good this year. yet no matter how hard i try i always seem to get bored with school after the first midterm and then i slack off. oh well, another one of my many faults. we all have them, and some try to change them, while others, like me, coast and are perfectly satisfied with that. i hope that this year is filled with woderful and exciting things like last year, but no matter how good this year may be, no year will ever top my freshman year..ever. and that is something i am extremely confidant in saying. freshman year was unforgetable thanks to a few memorable people who i will never forget. mmm much love..*      i am going to miss the class of 2004 so much. school wont be the same without them. i know that more freshman will be coming up and there will be new seniors, but i know that it just wont be the same. it saddens me to think about it too. they are all such nice people who helped make my freshman year unforgetable.      to the new freshman coming up. i dont know how i feel about them yet. i have heard many things about the class of 2008, good and bad. but who knows, hopefully those are just rumors and this year will run smoothly.     sometimes, i wish that time would slow down and that i would have more time as a kid, but i know that i dont. and here i am a 15 year old girl, just trying to make her way through this life before the  real   world starts. sometimes i wish i could stay a little kid forever, but i have already grown up so much. i miss the little things that i used to be able to get away with when i was young and i hate how fast were all growing up. i wish we could stay young forever and just be responsibility free. however, even though i want time to slow down, i want to grow up and see new things and get out of this town, i want to be able to drive and experience new things.  life is complicated like that and i dont think i'll ever understand it completely..

       hm yea well i cant belive that it is already august. in just a couple of weeks i'll be going back to school, which i am completely stoked for by the way. this is going to be m sophomore year and hopefullly i wont screw up so much this year, of course certain distractions will be gone, which i will both miss and enjoy all at the same time, even though i am sure that more will be coming up soon. monica and i have planned some of the stuff out so far. we are going to have lockers right next to each other and run down the halls as soon as we see each other hahaha. thats team polish for ya. monica went camping this week and i have no one i can really talk to about things so i guess thats why im writing now. hm. dance has been enjoyable for the most part and i am not as sore as i was the first week, but it is stil very hot in the studio with such big classes and i do not enjoy the body heat.      well a re cap onmy weekend. ok so this past weekend i ent to jessica frey's house, one of my vry dear friends from dance who i love to peices! well turns out, her b/f went to a party, so the two of us called everyone we knew who could drive and asked them to come get us, but they wouldnt. so then we wanted to go see a movie but we didnt do that either. so then we called some more people completely confussed onwhat to do. we settled on brownie mix and renting movies instead and since were kinda lazy we didnt actully wanna go to DB Mart (which the both of us concluded wasnt the real name of DAIRY MART hahahaha) so we called my ex b/f nick and asked him to brin us brownie mix. he said no so i left him avery mean voicmail bc he was ignoring me and kept telling me that he wold call me back and that wasnt acceptable. so jess's mom drove me, jess, and jess's lil siste alyssa down to DB Mart to get our brownie mix. well we ended up buying two boxes o brownie mix, one to make brownies and one to keep as mix so we could eat that. oh and we also bought two tubs of frosting hahaha. so we get home and we mak the brownies to eat first and jess and i show off our cooking skills by cracking eggs one handed perfectly, so after we mixed the stuff, jess decided that i should put the mix into the pan so i did, and instead of just smoothing the mix out, jessica takes the pan from me and starts shaking it from side to side and al around and the mix is goingall over the walls, however jessica didnt notice. what we also didnt notice was the fact that the brownies were completely uneven. haha well we discovered that when we took them out of the oven. so while these brownies are cooking jess and i go into the living room to eat our delicious mix and watchin EVIL KENEVIL! lol and it had a very stupid ending so we were dissapointed. then the real brownies were done but we didnt eat those. only little alyssa had a bite and decided she didnt want it anymore, then she fell alseep. aw she is so cute. then jessica and i rented a movie called "monster" which is bout a hooker who gets raped one time when she is screwing this guy and then shes kills him adn then she meets this girl and they make out and are kinda like lesbians but im not sure really and then this hooker who is charlese tharone who is usally wicked petty kills every guy she gets to have sex with her, but she doesnt really hae sex with them bc she learned her lesson, so she just kills them and stel their money. so in one scene the two girls are making out and jessica goes "eww this is like a scary movie. HIDE!" so her mother and i start laughing bc we think this is extremely funny, which it wa.so the jess an i went upstairs to put our pj's on or maybe itwas before we watched the scary movie haha but we went upstair either way and watched bring it on, always a funny movie and jessica decided she waned popcore, but she didnt have any, so i said we should go eat out frosting and we did..then we fell asleep adn i awoke to alyssa putting things in my face and jess's dg buddy stting on me. so then we woke up, got dresssed, ate english muffins (jessica cant put butter on them so i did it for her) and then we wnt to the mall with her b/f chris. and then chris bliss met up with us and i was pissed bc he is truely the one person on this planet that i cant fucking stand.  but oh well. jess and i wante to go into GAP so we did and they left us so we spent the remainder of the day tryong to find them. oh yea we bought chris an afro pick bc he had a fro. he was kinda mad but we thought it was funny. oh yea and jess had this coffee thing and she got it on he shirt so we had to get her a new one which took forever and then she ought a see thru one so she took my tank top and i really needed that tank top so i had to buy a new one and jess bought another coffee and got that on her shirt too! then we went back to her house and watching t.v until my mom came to get me. the end. i love jessica frey and chris is cool too. hes a good kid
