       So I've never been a real winner with boys.  I had a "boyfriend" once in the 6th grade. The "relationship" which consisted of talking a lot on AIM only lasted for about 2 months. I ended it 2 days before Valentines Day. I think this sort of symbolizes all of my relationships (or lack there of) with boys.  My only two guy friends, Nathan and Phil, think I'm a sadistic, creepy, punk/goth, girl. They can't make up their minds about the "punk" and "goth" thing. I'll let you in on a little secret...*whispers* I'm neither. I attract the most odd boys. There was Jason. He graduated last year. He waved to me clear across the cafeteria. I gave him a weird look. I had never seen him before and I wasn't sure if he was waving to me or if he was waving to someone behind me. My friend gave him all this information about me and 2 months later, my best friend and Jason were going out. Still are.  Then there was this kid James. I've never seen him in my life and somehow he seems to have thought I was "leading him on".  And then there was Daniel, the kid with Two First Names. He wrote me notes telling me that he liked me. And for a while we e-mailed eachother. Held some really interesting conversations with him. For instance, I found out that he hates everyone and that they all deserve to burn in Hell. Yes, I am assuming that includes me, as well.  And we can't forget my most recent; Danny. He wasn't so bad... I actually found this one to be cute. He  was  a senior...played snare on drumline. One day during band practice, it was raining, and Tara and Jen called me over.  Jen:  Do you know Danny *last named withheld*  Me:  *shifty eyes* yea.  Jen:  *giggle* Well, he told us to tell you, he likes you.  Me:  Oh... And so for about a month I had a bunch of people in band randomly come up and tell me to go and talk to him or they would ask me if I would consider dating him. What was I supposed to say? I've never talked to him before. Finally, this boy, after *counts* about 8 months, he got the nerves to talk to me. It was at the band banquet last Friday. He asked me to dance. I don't think I've ever felt so akward. My legs were shaking. I had to keep looking at the floor to make sure I didn't step on his feet. And to make matters worse, my strapless dress was on the verge of falling off.  And I cannot forget the Judah incedent. He was the boy I had an infatuation with in the 9th grade. It was quite scary. But he was nice about it, thankfully. He could have been the kind of person who would scream "Get away from me you creep! And stop writing 'I Love Judah" all over that notebook paper!'"  Did I mention I've never been kissed? I feel like I'm missing out on a lot here.  Right now I'm sort of...well, I'm feeling "emo" if you will. Not quite, but you get the idea, right? See, there is this boy. Everyone calls him Tokyo. I met him this...well, no, it was last year. He is on drumline (plays snare, like Danny). Every year the marching band has a trip to Disney World. I met him on the first ride, The Rockin Roller Coaster. I hate those rides. I'm scared to death. Well, this boy randomly walks up to Jenn (monobuddy) and I and introduces himself, and we introduce ourselves to him. And then he started talking randomly and I started cracking up. Jenn just gave him a weird look. Well, I go several months without talking to this boy and one day, during lunch, he walks up to me and asks my friends and I to buy a candy bar. They all refused and then out of no where...  Tokyo:  Jackie will buy candy from me won't you? Because you love me right?  Me:  *thinking* How the Hell did he remember my name? *end of thinking* Oh, yea of course... and so I bought a Reese's Peanut Buttercup from him. And for two weeks this boy would hit me up for money. (It was a fund raiser for band). All throughout band season I would talk to this boy. It was great! Except I found myself falling for him. After a band competition Jenn, her brother, Tokyo, and I were in the band room alone-ish. Everyone was outside waiting for a ride. Tokyo was showing us his mad Break dancing skills. Then out of nowhere he asks Andrew, Jenn's brother, for a hug. and they embraced. Then he asked Jenn for a hug. They embraced. He finally got around to me. I told him I'd give him a hi-five. He said hi-fives were no fun and asked Andrew for another hug. Then he turned back to me and asked for a hug again. I let in. It was the best hug ever...well, I can't realy compare. He was the first guy I'd ever hugged. He picked me up and spun me around...then I stepped on his foot because I lost my balence. That was a little embarassing. *blushes* And then band season ended and he stopped coming by my lunch table to say Hi. I was greatly saddened by this. Band Banquet rolls around and I'm feeling unnaturally lonely. It's spring time and everyone seems to be in a relationship. Jenn gets up to dance with one of her friends and leaves me...alone to play the the fringe at the end of my dress... at the table...in the dark...        Slow songs get me everytime...because I have no one to hold me. Danny was the first boy to ask me to dance. It was nice. After the song ended Tokyo asks me to dance. One of the best nights of my life. I know how terribly sad that sounds, but it made me feel loved. I didn't feel at all akwad with him. He was singing to whatever song was playing...which kind of scared me since it was by NSYNC or a band of the sort. And then one of the bubbles that were floating around my head popped on my arm. I gave a look of total shock which I guess he found amusing because he stopped singing and laughed. After the song ended I was slightly ecstatic that he asked me to dance yet somewhat saddened to think this would be the last time I'd probably talk to him...    Well, I just need to get over the fact that I can't have Tokyo. It worked with Judah so it should work with Tokyo too...(although the situations differed from eachother). After re-reading this post I have come to the conclusion that I am a pathetic little girl...why do I keep insulting myself?      *just a reminder* http://veganeyes.blogspot.com/

       My eye has been twitching even since school has let out. I just recently re-found my emo-esque glasses and the twitching seems to have stopped. Isn't that just peachy?  I have to go to Miss Wahnita's house tonight. She's my colorguard instructor. The section leaders and guard instructors are going to start creating the routine. Ha, only none of us have ever done this before. See, Ranaye will be good help. She's a natural at colorguard/rifle. Jenn will be good too because she's an awesome dancer. I'm lacking talent in both area's. I'll pipe up every now and then...'yea...sounds great' or, 'that doesn't fit the music'. I'm kind of nervous about tonight.  I had to babysit today! For two hours. I was paid 15 bucks too. Nice! Oh, I think I'm hungry.   Tiger Army's new cd come out June 29! I'm so excited!

       No matter how hard I try I can't get Tokyo out of my head.  I was at guard practice today and Miss Wahnita brought up candy sales. Then I remembered that's when I first actually started talking to the boy and then I got all sad that he was leaving and that I'd never get to talk to him again. And now I'm getting angry at myself for feeling this way because we weren't as close as I'd like to hope.    Speaking of guard practice.  I did something today that 1. Caught everyone off guard and 2. Will probably haunt me for the rest of my section leader days.  Jenn, Ranaye, and I were recently named section leaders for color guard. Only problem is we're the anti-social type. Especially Jenn and I. Everyone thinks I'm this quiet little girl (most friends will tell ya differently). Anyhoo, we had to lead a group of 30 or so girls out to the field to practice marching but no one would call them to attention. So I took charge. I yelled at the top of my lungs "Mark time, mark up! 1-2-3..." then I stopped realizing that I was calling out the orders too fast and the loudness of my own voice freaked me out. Then I busted out laughing. As did Jenn, Ranaye, Miss Val, Miss Wahnita, and our new, gay, rifle instructor, Corey. Took us about 2 minutes to compose our selves. Then I let Ranaye call out the orders. This is something I definatly have to get used to, being a section leader.   And now, onto something that doesn't relate to color guard in any way. So here is the deal. I've got this...'thing'...everyone else calls it a deformation/malformation. And it's called Syrengomielia. I can't even spell is correctly. Basically, my brain, at birth, did not fully develop, or something to that extent. This has allowed for cerebral fluid to drip into my spinal cord. (ew) Apparently my cerebellum is "hanging down too far" and because of that the cerebral fluid is unable to drain from my spinal cord. I've had to have two MRIs. The sounds those machines make sound a lot like hardcore techno. I was greatly amused by this. My MRIs are totally irrelevant to the rest of this story. Anyhoo, the neurologist was discussing the possibility of going through with the surgery. Nothing major, they'd only have to shave off part of my skull and then cut into some misc tissue coving my spine. (ew) That kind of freaked me out. And then, it gets better, after the surgery is done with, my neck will be super sore, but that's ok! Because my veins will be pumped full of vallium and other misc pain killers! I have this...fear about pain killers. Maybe I'll go into that in another misc. post, but not right now.  Aye, so I'm off to bed. I'm doing this unpain internship thing with Joanne/The Humane Society tomorrow from noon to 5:00.
