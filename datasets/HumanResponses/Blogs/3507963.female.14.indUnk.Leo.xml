      I'm still confused about this whole blog-ness thing. Oh well. Might as well just start filling you in on stuff in my life and all that happy... uh... stuff.      Tab doesn't work. -_-. Now I must remember... 5 spaces! Am I making no sense? Eh... whatever.      If you can't tell by the end of the last entry... I'm Lizz. I know the Vicky... who rocks. I chose --bLeEdInG nIrVaNa-- as a name cuz for one, I'm strange, and for two... it fits. In addition to being a very awesome band, Nirvana is also a state of mind and type of 'heaven', for those who didn't know, and in my wonderful name... it means the latter.      (grumble grumble... tab key needs to work... grr.) See, my life is in a bit of a... I guess you could say disarray currently. So my state of happiness... my 'safe haven'... my -nirvana-... is slipping away... bleeding. See... I make sense. 0_0! I made sense!      And everyone who doesnt know... I get to go to a Bob Dylan concert on June 5th. Bob Dylan is my idol and role model and I love him. Okay... love's going pretty far... but not in the sense you're thinking! I'm not in love with some seventy year old man!!!! Heh...      Anyway I'm happy about that... but that's about it. I need sleep... sorry, randomness. Anyway... I don't know many things right now. VICKY LOVES JIM!!!!! And I don't know who I love. I'm just weird like that... eh. Whatever. I'll figure myself out soon enough, I guess.      A lot of things have gone awry lately. And awry is my new word. My grandma fell and fractured her hip, my cousin had what they thought to be a stroke, my grandpa had surgery... all isn't very good. Plus my sister and parents fighting... mother and father fighting about... what else? Me.      I love my life.      Out for now... bysebye.  -Lizz

      Hey... This is my wonderful blog. Welcome, everyone who might care..      Vicky Rocks... just to let you all know that.     I don't know what to really say or do here. I'm confused at the moment, by a whole lot... and I have a feeling this is going to end up more of something for my friends to figure out what the Hell is happening in my life than anything else. I love them... I love them all. But crap gets hectic sometimes... and yeah. blah.     I think that's gonna be it for now, I'm just kinda.. trying to set stuff up right now. Byesbye.  -Lizz

      A lot of different reasons. Enjoying sentence fragments. Blah, though. Very blah. Stopping sentence fragments.  I don't like myself today much. I feel like pathetic person who's dwelling on shit way too much and can't get myself out of a hole that I dug for myself. And jumped in. I thought that love was different than this. I thought it brought less pain... but I guess that's only when it's returned. I mean, I figured out relatively recently that I'm in love. And that life starts really fucking up when I'm like this. I'm friends with Taylor again, and now I wish we never...ever... made amends. She's not lying again, though every time I see her I wish that I was back fully with her and she would be lying again. And then I realize how stupid I'm being because that was never real. She made me lose faith in so much and I'm such an idiot for wanting that back. And now I feel very stupid cuz I'm almost afraid to talk to Sanitha, because she'll pull me back... either way I'm pulled back somewhere. I want to be pulled back into hating her and knowing it's all a lie but I want everything to become real again at the same time...  That and now Taylor and Jay are together so much recently... and I'm pretty sure she knows I like him and he knows I do too and he knows how angry I am at her... I respect that he likes her but how can I respect how she's only playing along to spite me...? I don't want him to get hurt, but in a way.... well, more than a way... that's not all that hurts. I feel like such an idiot. I'm back to where unrequited love is fucking killing me again and know what? I knew this was gonna happen... I  knew  it. But whatever... I shouldn't even care and even though I can't stop myself from thinking about it and I can't stop how much pain seeing them together brings.... I should shut up. It's not as if they're 'together'... they aren't going out but he still loves her.... god, why can't I just find  someone ...  somewhere ... who loves  me ? Wasn't he not ready...?  I love him...  -Lizz ((I have to be with you... To live, to breathe, You're taking over me...))

      Anthony's house. Didn't explain that... and that can sound quite horrible if left unexplained.  OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG HIS SISTER IS SO CUTE! Lol... just hadta say that. Her name is Aubrey... I don't know how old she is but she can't be much past a year. She looks up to him so much...  Anyway... I was taking a walk and listening to Sugarcult, and ran into him... near his house... ((oh, what an odd place to run into someone... near their house. heh.)) And he was playing tennis with this kid Billy. So they finished their game, and we were hanging out for a while... and by this point about an hour went by. So we ditched Billy.. lol.  We went down to his house and played "HORSE" basketball... only it was "GOTHIC"... because he was being stupid and calling me gothic... which I don't believe I am. Not the stereotype anyway...  And we ate lunch at his house, cuz his mommy made us food lol. I feel like I got to know him a lot more, for some reason. In six or so years of being his friend, I've never been over his house.  AND HIS SISTER IS SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!! lol  -Lizz

      I'm tired, as the title suggests, but I'm a bit happier. I spent my day mainly in two places... school, and Anthony's house. School-for once- rocked. Jay's band played... and I was like "WOOHOO!"... heh. They really were good. Even if I didn't like Jay... I'd still hafta admit that they rocked.  Mrs. Marak wasn't as... bitchy... as she normally is. And after not talking to Jay ((random... not like mad at him just kinda not been able to)) since last saturday... I saw him a lot today and he imed me... so I guess you could say I'm in a good mood.  I'm not happy... not by a long shot... but I'm.... uh... not even content... um... I don't know. I don't know how to phrase this... at all. I feel like shooting myself and I feel like smiling...  I don't know. I think I'm gonna leave there. I love Jay. Byesbye.  -Lizz ((So how does it feel? How does it feel? 'cause it's tearing me apart...))

      Blahfullness.  Listening to Sugarcult. Have been for the last three hours or so... maybe 2 1/2. I'm quite blah. I just realized shit... a lot of shit... today. Like how much I miss Taylor. Yes, that fucking bitch. I have to fucking miss her because I'm fucking stupid and I can't fucking deal with being without someone to fucking lean on and I feel so fucking weak that I don't want to be this alone anymore... but I'm sure me saying that is getting quite annoying. I feel like I'm incapable of feeling anything and at the same time I feel like I'm feeling too much... (ignore the sickness, I don't think I need to tell you that much...) I don't know anymore. I know I like Jay. I know I miss Anthony, even though I just talked to him. I don't mean I miss him like I haven't seen him... I mean I miss him like he used to be someone else and I lost the person he was and now there's only the bitter shell of what he used to be... and he's not even inside anymore. Blah.  And that's all I know. I feel very scared, and I'm not quite sure what about. Scared of falling for Jay, but screw that I've already fucking fallen. And it sucks. Ass. Stupid yearbook reminding me of him and stupid mind thinking about him and stupid me liking him and stupid fucking situation that I keep putting myself in. I hate it. I hate it all.  I thought that pulling myself back to reality would help. All it's done is gotten me back into what I used to be and I hate that me and I hate that side of myself. I hate THIS side of myself. And I can't even change. I feel like I have a broken leg and someone's taken my walking stick. I know it's a bad example... but that's the only thing I can think of. I feel like I keep screwing shit up for myself and that's all I'm capable of. And no one seems to be giving me advice on the one thing I need... but it's kinda impossible to do so because no one really knows what that is. I don't need advice... more like input. And I feel like a stupid ass saying it because it really doesn't seem like much of a problem even though it's kinda... tearing me apart... and no one has guessed because I seem so fucking sure of the answer already... grrrffff. No one gets my hints... lol. And in a way I don't wanna ask cuz I'm afraid of the answer. I hate being afraid. Gahness.  Thing I need input on... Jay. Thank you captain obvious. I want to know if I have like... any chance... with him... at all. See what I mean it seems like it's not any real problem? I don't get why I care so much. I don't like caring. That, too, can make things real. I unfortunately know that too well. Grf. And now do y'all see why I'm afraid of the answer? I want people to think that I know it's no... but I don't and I hate to think that cuz it's like... "Heart...*SQUEEEEEESH!!*" lol... don't you love my little analogies?  And I may have said this before but I don't feel like checking my posts... but Cate already told him and shit and now she says she thinks he's not ready for a relationship which sucks on it's own.. and makes the above question's answer an obvious no. I guess the question is more of a "give me hope... give me back something to hold on to"... so... yeah...  Yeah.... I'm gonna.... go... byesbye...  -Lizz ((And I self destruct... Close my eyes and there... ...There you are...))

      The thing about heartache is that it always hurts like the first time.   That was quite random but quite true. And yes my new word is quite. For the time being, anyway. Yeah.  I guess you can pretty much guess why I said that... for one or the other reason, depending on your train of thought and how much you can pick up from subtle hints... Yeah. I'm... I don't know. I'm both happy and sad at the same time now. I'm happy for a few reasons, and sad for just as many.  I'm happy because I went to the mall with Vicky and her brother Randall yesterday. That was cool.. and I got new earrings and a wristband that says "Damn you all" and has Stewie from Family Guy on it. I also got fuck bracelets. I've been out of them for a while. They all broke, as... um... odd... as that can sound. Also, lately, I'm becoming friends again with Sanitha. I missed her... Taylor somehow managed to keep me from talking to her, that patronizing bitch. Yeah... I still have a bit of resentment there. ¬¬... but the point is that I'm talking to her again, and she's making me feel better about the whole Taylor situation.  The downside to alla that is that I still feel horrible. I mean, she deserved it, and I know she was lying, but for some reason something still doesn't feel right. I don't know... it's just... there. I can't place it. But I feel bad...  really  bad. How I hate her...  And I feel bad cuz I feel like I'm annoying Vicky with this whole Taylor thing. All she seems to talk about is Jim these days, and that's not unendurable... they're going out. Let her be happy, ya know? I appreciate that... it's just that sometimes it feels like she doesn't care. I'm not much better though, with my inscessent talk of Taylor... and of Jay... I mean, I can't pretend that it just went away... but I suppose that she can't pretend that she doesn't care about Jim. I respect that... I do. I don't know what it is. I'm prolly just being a selfish bitch again, like I always seem to be. Maybe that's why I always end up screwing up with every guy I like...  Like Jay. I really like him. I don't wanna say I'm in love... cuz saying things aloud finalizes shit and I don't wanna be in love. But I really do like him. But I prolly screwed so much shit up without meaning to cuz I know there's no way in hell that he'd like me... and I don't mean screwed shit up with him... for once I think that's actually hard to do. If I know he doesn't like me anyway, I can't ruin anything. And we're friends... and friendships are more... um... shall I say... durable? But I mean I think I just screwed shit up for myself again. I fell for a guy who I have less than no chance with, and I'm just gonna end up breaking my heart again because... well.. there's no goddamn chance. I hate doing this to myself. And I feel like I'm gonna cry cuz I fucking hate going through this but whatever I can't fucking do anything cuz know what? I was fucking stupid enough to start it...  And yeah. With that ever-so-happy note... I'm leaving. Cuz I don't wanna depress myself further. Even though I know that even if I'm not writing about it I'll be thinking about it.... whatever... know what.. it doesn't matter... I should fucking get over shit. Byesbye...  -Lizz- ((These thoughts of you Are taking over...)) --Evanescence--

      Sorry, it's once again been a long time since I've written. But at least this time I didn't need someone to remind me. I know who I like now, for once. I think I may be in love, but then again I thought that before, and I feel really stupid saying so since there's almost no way he can have any feelings back. He just seems like a really cool guy and I'm kinda lost....  Lost in you, And I can't find myself again... -Sugarcult  Heh. Vicky has my CD, otherwise I'd probly be listening to that song repeatedly now.  In other news, I lost one of my best friends because I no longer believe her about all of the fucked up obscure lies she's been telling me. And since I don't believe her, she hates me. Gee, I'm sorry Mrs. Bitch, of course it wasn't your fault that you lie to me... it's my fault for not being so gullible. Of course.  No, you don't sense anger at all. Or sarcasm! Of course not! *Leaks sarcasm* Goddammit be that way then... lol. I want to shoot her in her head. And hope she dies somewhere very uncomfortable. I'm sorry... it's just... I can deal with it when people hurt me, I can deal with it when people insult me... I hate liars. I hate them with a passion.  But surprisingly enough, though I have nothing and no one to really hold on to now, I'm finding I don't need to. I figured things out on my own, like how I like Jason, and how Taylor was lying to me all this time. Maybe this hurts, but so what? I can deal with pain. It just sucks being alone, and I guess that now that's my only problem. My only problem won't be fixed for a while. I just hate being like this.  She was never beautiful. Is that what they wanted? Beauty? She'd stand alone. Would she walk with another? No; She drowned in her painted smiles And critiszised features. (He didn't love her; He could never love her.)   Yeah, it's a work in progress and it sucks. Oh well. I have those last two lines stuck in my head. I'll add more. I'll post it when it's done. I'm leaving you now. Byesbye.  -Lizz

      I was intending to just kinda add this in randomly so that no one would notice it, but I guess in a way I'm hoping for people to notice it... so I'm adding it in.  There's some stuff, that I'm, as I said, afraid to say lest it become real. But I believe that a lot of that stuff is also really obvious. Not written in here... but stuff that I've said and that I've been talking about. The problem is that the same things I'm afraid to say, that are obvious, are also the things that I'm not sure of. So I can't even talk about it. Grrr.  Alright that's it.. I promise. Byesbye.  -Lizz

      Vicky's begging me to update this, so grr I will. Eh, today is an odd day. I feel, and I've already explained this to Vicky, intense. More... of everything. I don't feel like explaining myself. So I won't.  Yeah, everything's just a bit weird today, and I just realized I haven't updated in a while. I guess I should. I'm still in advanced Language Arts! Teehee, I'm so weird. But happy... ish. I don't know how I feel today. Kinda as if telling me something happy would make me ecstatic, and telling me something sad would make my mood turn... evil. Like it has been. I'm in the middle of moods, and all I need is a push to be one way or the other.  Vulnerable. There's the right word.  I'm confused, a bit, but not incredibly. I, for once, know what's happening in my life and that's a good feeling. Well, I still don't know what's happening because everything seems to be in waves. One moment I feel one way, another moment it's depleted. I like someone, and then I don't, I hate someone, and then I'm fine. I don't know what this is... it's as if everyone can just push me in their own way and I guess, in MY own way, I hate that feeling. I don't know why. I guess I'm just a dependent freak who will always be the one getting molded.  Clay. Vulnerable Clay. I have two words.  I'm half asleep, and I have been for a while. It's kinda like the whole world is going on around me and I'm dreaming it all in some kind of trance I can't get out of. I was half able to convince myself it was winter on May 31st. That proves I'm letting things pass me by. I think I should leave now... my endless ranting is probably annoying you all.  So I'll leave you as tranced vulnerable clay.  And another thing... I hate being this way. There are things I'm afraid to speak out loud for fear that'll make them real... there's shit I'm not sure of... all that happiness. In fact, I'm not sure of a lot. As I said, I like someone, then I don't, then I hate someone, then I'm pushed another way. This gets SO annoying.  Well I'm gonna leave you now. Byesbye.  -Lizz ((Please, someone, teach me how to swim...               Please, Don't let me drown))

      Though I'm still completely stressed and depressed about Anthony (most likely) moving, I actually had a good day. I handed in my note to Mrs. Quinn-Devine that says I can go into advanced Language Arts, as well as one my dad wrote as a joke. It was bad grammar written with a marker in really horrible handwriting, signed X. Hehe... sometimes I love my daddy. Mrs. Quinn-Devine found it funny, at any rate.  And I discovered something! Yes... me... the mentally blonde one. I discovered something. The Bob Dylan concert is tomarrow. YAY! I actually have good seats, and I get to see my idol. I'm sure I've said this many times, but it's actually just still hitting me... so bear with me please. I'm not sure how to say this next thing without sounding like I'm bragging or showing off or something, but I got an A on my science quiz too. All in all, everything seemed okay today. I wasn't drawing mushrooms everywhere, either. That's actually the first day in a long time where I haven't. That kinda scares me...  I want to show you my new poem that I haven't been able to finish. I like it so far, but it needs work, in my opinion. Eh, here goes...   Glass-Coated Rose  Her roses are glazed over In a thin coat of glass, Frozen to the table From months of lying idly by. The once-liquid covering Provides a razor-sharp edge And gives new meaning To a new leaf overturned. You never loved her As a frozen angel- So why should you  When she's just a broken star? Dewdrops coat her black petals With ice... As well as the maddening surface Af polished glass. So like her cracked mirror Encased in warped wood- The ashy image of her past Taunts her with her tears. Bumps distorted the sights Of her eyes and her pasty face... She was beautiful, always, Outside of the thorns. They always loved to cut her wrist open Just to drop the crimson dye Into the blackness of it's petals. But her rose would never be red Like the others; No matter how much sorrow she spilt, Only ashes covered it's frame. *Lizz  And I'm leaving there. Anyone who can, please comment on the poem. I think I like it... but I want more opinions. Well I'm gonna go.. byesbye.  -Lizz ((With a  smile  and a  sigh , I'm on your  side ...)) *GGD

      And today I am pro-mushroom. I don't know... mushrooms are cool today. Maybe it's because the anti-mushroom thing has wiped off my hand. Yes... I had an anti-mushroom symbol on my hand.  Anyway, I think that June 3rd is my unlucky day. One of my best friends, Anthony, might be and probably is moving away from me. He lives right down the street, and now he might be leaving. I'm gonna miss him... so fucking much. But hopefully he'll stay in our town, and if not... well... we'll keep in touch. Oh crap... he's gonna read this isn't he? Hehe... whatever. I really don't care. I know it won't do anything to just sit here and hope that he won't leave, because I can't change what's going to happen. That doesn't, however, make it suck any less.  It seems I've been losing a lot of people lately, or coming close to it anyway. Anthony's probably moving, my grandma needs surgery on her hip, my grandpa had surgery on his feet, my cousin had a near-stroke and lost feeling in his left side (but regained it!)... and everyone seems so distant that I really feel like I have lost them. Whatever, I'm probably just being selfish little bitchy me. I don't want to be me. Can't I be selfish bitchy... someone else? Eh... I shall deal.  So... yeah. And all I have that's going right is the no-progress-reports (which I can't even be sure of, some are still coming out and I didn't know that), the concert Saturday, and advanced Language Arts. Cate is proud of me though... even though I can't really see why anyone has faith in me lately. I seem to screw everything up. Don't fight back, anyone who's gonna try to. I do.   "I'll take a doctor's reccomended time to get along... since you've been gone, oh I'll get along oh anyway at all..."-Goo Goo Dolls. Grrr... why can I relate almost everything to Anthony moving away? I have two new favorite quotes... partially because they don't remind me of him. They're both from one of Bob Dylan's poems.  "I accept chaos. I am not sure whether it accepts me." AND... "I do know that we're all gonna die some day and that no death has ever stopped the world."  Yeah... and with that... I'm ending for today. I don't really have much to say... but I didn't want to just ignore my blog for today, and I guess I needed to get my thoughts out. So... yeah. Byesbye.  -Lizz  -You're all I am... can you teach me to believe in something?-   ~GGD

      I'm not quite sure why I'm anti-mushroom today. Maybe it's because the mushrooms I keep drawing everywhere remind me of the toadstools in Mario, and Mario bugs me because it reminds me of Dave. And I don't like Dave at the present time. Dave is my sister's ex boyfriend. She's still like... in love with him. And he broke her heart too many times for me to forgive him, and I think even too many times for her. I don't know anymore, and I barely even know the story with him anymore. Alyssa barely talks to me lately.  Though I did talk to her today, after me and Vicky got into advanced Language Arts for H.S. ... which I've been wanting for so long. She has her reasons, which I won't name here, because I'd doubt she'd want me to, but I'm happy for her nevertheless. I'll tell my reasons... because I seriously doubt that anyone but Taylor and Cate and Vicky and MAYBE Janet read this, and I trust them. My gramma always thought I was a good writer... when she died two years ago, I... I guess I still haven't fully gotten over it. She always wanted me to be a writer because it was (and is) what I love, and for her I want to pursue it. And currently I would really like to prove my sister wrong, because she says I'm probably going to drop out of L3 classes 'cause I'm taking Latin. I don't understand her logic, I doubt I ever will.  Anyways, as I said, I actually had a convorsation with Alyssa today- for the first time in a very long time. I discovered what little faith she has in me, if you can consider that a benefit. She keeps telling me that I'll never make it in H.S. because I'm in two L3 classes (science and soon to be Language Arts... I love Mrs Quinn-Devine at the current moment)and she's saying that I'll probably drop out of them both before the end of the year. The first time when I'm actually proud of myself, and my family can't be. When will this fucking cycle end? Eh... whatever.  There is a Mushroom on my hand... just to let you all know that. I was very bored in Math class today. Mrs. Cappacio said something about me getting A's when I don't do my homework... I wonder if she means this term. I kinda need an A... or my dad's head might blow up from the inflation being right gives him. I swear, his head is a balloon... filled with air, and expanding at unnatural rates. I don't like him much currently, when all he can talk about is everything I've done wrong.  My mom, on the other hand... I love her. She's overworked, and victim to my father... but I love her so much. She actually tries, unlike him. And I love her for trying, even if she gets... um... unreasonable at times. My sister, I also love... but she's a.. how can I put this? Lost cause? That sounds horrible... but it's true. She's trying to pull herself together, but she's so far apart already... I don't mean to have no faith, not like her... I just guess I don't want to hope for too much. I want to believe that she can get better than she is, but in a way I don't because I don't want her to fall again and be left dissapointed. I guess I shouldn't lose faith... I guess I just just have hope. But she makes it hard sometimes.  I'm listening to Nine Days. I'm not sure why... they're really not much my style of music anymore. I love them though, because they seem to fit my mood at the current time. And they have a song called Bob Dylan. I can't wait for June 5th... it's only three days away! And I get to see Bob Dylan. I know I might sound obsessed... but that's just because today, I'm so close to tears, that I feel like dwelling on whatever can make it go away. It's not working. I don't know what it is, even. I mean... normally I can at least distinguish between happy tears and sad tears, but this just seems like... 'everything coming together' tears. I don't know, even that doesn't fit this.  Moooonkey. This is such an odd day... but a good day. These next three days are going to be the longest days of my life. And Mrs. Quinn-Devine hugged me and I'm scared. Hehe... I love her for putting me into advanced Language Arts and because she called my writing paper "Magnificent" in front of the whole class... A++! Hehe... I'm ending this entry 'cause Cate's probably getting impatient. Love you, hun... lol. Byebye.  -Lizz

      Alright, so my attempt to use five spaces instead of a tab key didn't work, and now I am saddened. -_-. lol... I'm acting strange today. I'm actually in a very good mood, and I don't know why. I'm kind of confused today by stuff, but I won't go into detail. I guess I'm just... content. I'm not happy, not by a long shot, but I'm content.  I'm listening to Dropkick Murphys, and they're improving my good mood. I don't know what it is about this day, but something's bringing it up... and that's a good thing. Everything still seems to be "bleeding" away, slowly, because everything I told you last entry is still going on. My gramma's still in the hospital, and I recently realized something.  I was over the wonderful Taylor's house for a sleepover, and we went to her mom's friend's house, who lives near my grandma- sort of. This is before I knew she was in the hospital, or that she had even fallen. I kept randomly getting worried about her and saying "I wish I could just walk down there", even though it was way too long of a walk and I couldn't.And then I came back and my dad called and told me that she fell and fractured her hip, and that was kind of freaky...  And today I realized that, and that this term is the first time in three years that I haven't gotten a progress report. So I guess that's a reason for being happy :-\.   I'm gonna go for now... byesbye.  -Lizz

        Anthony's moving away. Everything is so messed up right now... I don't know what to do, or say to him, because I guess you've noticed that there's a lot that I want to say and none that I really can to him... meaning... I still love him.... mein gott, ich liebe... am I speaking German? **Hits self over head repeatedly* BAD!....if you don't know, DON'T ASK.     &nbsp;   Okay... I realize now that what I just related is a bit... a lot... sudden. Well, I was talking to him on Saturday, and he told me he's moving. I almost started crying but I hate Anthony seeing me cry, because I feel so fucking vulnerable around him and I hate feeling vulnerable... so I stopped myself, or tried to as best I could. In other words I successfully kept him from seeing anything. This was partially helped out by him falling into the water... (we were at this pond thingy... I just call it the place with water cuz it's not really a pond but whatever)&nbsp; but THAT'S OKAY!     &nbsp;   Well... a lot of stuff happened... and while we were talking I realized that I love him... still... that I never didn't... bllaaaahhhh....     &nbsp;   And I still like Jay, but listen. I realized that me and him would probably be so much better as just friends. I realized that a bit late, but I still realized it. And I think I'm gonna tell Anthony this soon. As soon as I can, anyway...     &nbsp;   --Lizz    ((I'm falling even more in love with you,    Letting go of all I've held on to...))

       I've decided that my main dispute (possibly also my only dispute) with the human race is that we have so many disputes among ourselves. Why&nbsp;do we only sit and fight&nbsp;with one another, when we could be doing and being so much more and having such a more interesting life? And I'm not really one to talk, considering mostly all I do is sit and THINK... Melancholy thoughts that seldom have more than very little to do with my actual existence here. Also I do admit to the fact that though my dispute with the human race is simply that they have disputes among each other, I constantly have disputes against myself- and&nbsp;that, if only in the&nbsp;slightest, must be a bit worse as to&nbsp;these recently acknowledged annoyances of mine.&nbsp;In fact, I'm quite sure of it.   &nbsp;  I'm sorry about the exceedingly random change in literary style on this blog, but this&nbsp;is how my thoughts have been running all day. As to Jay, and everything I was about to explain to you last entry about my moods, doings, and happenings as of late, I am fully sure those issues will resurface sooner than not. For all my knowledge and foresight, they may resurface this entry. And by-the-bye, yes, I am trying to counterbalance the seriousness of my current tone with the color and general mood by appearance. Reader be cautioned that I do not normally speak in this way; this is simply an additional part of the mood which seems to have overtaken me recently.    &nbsp;  This blog is additionally annoying me profusely, and presently listening to Jimmy Eat World, SaveFace, and Lakota&nbsp;is balancing that off, in addition to restoring me to my common state. Well, I have decided that it would be more productive for me to speak of more interesting issues that have been happening as of late, or at the very least to speak of feelings and situations that have arisen recently.    &nbsp;  I must confess that part of my reason for writing in this tone is because of a report that I must do this summer, and most likely should be writing at this present moment. There are a great many requirements as to this report, including the use of no contractions, and such like. I cannot write in this way without training myself for it, and therefore I  am  training myself for it. In writing this report, I also have been informed of the need to be 'analytical but pithy' in tone, of which expression I have attached not the slightest inclination of meaning, which is to say, I have not the slightest idea of such. I look at this now as a slight idea of creative writing; being so far from my usual style that as to my mind it  is  creative.    &nbsp;  I fear I must take leave of you now, and I once again offer my apologies for the unannounced change in literary style of this blog. As to next entry, I will mostly likely try to speak of issues with more importance attached to them.    &nbsp;  --Lizz   ((When will this end?   It goes on and on,   Over and over,   And then over again...   Spin me&nbsp;around,   I know that it won't stop-   Till I step down   From this for good...))

      This will make no sense, but...  I fucking hate him. He can sit there and tell me to do anything he fucking wants but he can't fucking take it upon himself... Not only that, but saying it's "a part of living here"???? HYPOCRIT! Yeah, he lives here too, and fucking sits on his ass all day except for telling people what's fucking wrong and then doing fucking NOTHING to fix it... What the Hell?

      Lookin' up at the sky, But I can't find the mystery, epiphany, hypocrisy..  Yet I know, Somehow,  Everything's failed; Everything's fallen. I would've liked to see it all... They said it was perfect, And it was masterful, And it was beautiful. But I still look down at broken wings, I still look down at these scars, And this heart, and these arms, And smile. It's 3am again, I've forgotten how to fly out my window. But everything's okay, anyway, Either way, every way... Just a little more broken. Yet I can't escape this room, These white walls, blank halls... Where I've tried to lay my head. It's fruitless. I'll sink into the comfortless pillows, Just because they block out sound. I've got my light, My life, my luck, My everything, to pull through. Once I break through all my walls, Once I learn to ignore the noise, The nothing, the neverending... I'll be hiding, I'll be here, I'll be home. But the pillow's never soundproof, And there's branches breaking, Burning, bursting... Under my feet. When will my heart stop crying... When will my mind stop lying... When will I stop waiting... Stop waiting for you?  --Lizz ((Again I feel that jealousy and anxiousness Has left you hating me... I can't wait to wake up to an empty answering machine But I shouldn't have to...))

      Um... yeah. I don't know what to do lately. I know that I love Jay and that's kinda... I dunno... kinda like everything else: confusing. Everything is going up and down and I guess that lately I should be happy with my life but I don't know. Everything's kinda at a standstill and I guess I'm not in the best of moods to deal with people. But I need people... I don't know what to say about shit anymore and everything is so fucked up...  No matter what situation I'm in it seems that whatever I do is wrong and the wrong way to deal with stuff... but I don't know HOW to deal with half of what's facing me even in a simple conversation. I can never say the right thing, especially if I'm not comfortable with someone, or if I'm nervous... I think too much and I hate that side of me. Everything seems so much more fucked up than it really is and I don't know what's wrong with me but I can't seem to say anything right. Nothing comes out the way I'm sure I thought it and it always seems like I'm on a different side of something than I really am. As I said before, I have no wits about me when I'm nervous... but that's when I need them. I need to know what to do when I'm nervous like this ((I say "like this" because I'm talking to Jay... but I just left because I feel very very awkward for some reason...))  I don't know. Everything's messed up and I don't like the way my life is going right now, even if it seems okay from the outside. But... blah. Very very blah.  --Lizz ((You're makin' me fall down, I'm fallin' down again... I wish you could fall down, Can you catch me, darlin'? I'm home... I'm home... I'm home...))

      Yeah, random. I don't know why I'm in this type of mood, but I am... it's not bad. Not good, not good at all, but not bad.  I love Jay, and that's getting to be quite an annoying thing in in my life. I don't enjoy being "in love", because it's such a horrible feeling when the person doesn't care about you in that way... I don't know if he even cares that I like him. I mean, he knows... even Anthony was able to talk more about how he feels, be more... there... real...  Not that he's not there. I talk to him a lot, and he's such a good friend... but it's odd sometimes, when I know he knows I like him... but I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to say that. I don't know... I'm way too nervous and I hate being nervous and.. yes, scared. I don't like being scared, and I don't like liking people because as I said... it hurts when they don't like you. And I only know of one person who seems to enjoy pain... Taylor.  I've decided. I don't want her back, and I hope she never comes back. She's a manipulative bitch who's always longing for something she can never get, and she needs it so bad that she lies about having it.  Yeah. Back to what I was saying... lol.  I don't know why I like him and I don't know why I can't change that. I hate not being able to know or control how I feel, but then again I know that no one really can. And at the very least I know that. Once again, I hate to feel this way. And I hate it how all I really want is for him to feel the same but he never really will. Or Hell, he may eventually for all I know cuz the world is a fucked up place. But as far as what I know to ring true so far, he most likely won't. God, why do I have to love him? and if I had to love someone.... why does it have to be him? Why does my life have to be so goddamn messed up?  And okay, I'm going to stop ranting now, and apoligize. I haven't been able to say two words about how I feel about this recently and I needed to let it all out... sooo yeah. It's out... lol.  --Lizz ((Asleep at the wheel, with both feet on the clutch, While I.... Pray for a sign, but I'm askin' too much... I...

      Hello. I'm back, and for the last two entries, I am truly sorry. That happens sometimes.  I told you I'd tell you about camp when I was feeling more story-teller-ish, and I'm not. But I shall tell you, because if I hold it off any longer you ain't gonna know... lol.  Okay, first day. Going up to Calumet, I was in a good mood because it was like going away from everything that was bothering me and driving myself away from all of my problems. We got lost inside the camp, going to the wrong place at first, but afterwards we found where we were supposed to go and all was, once again... actually together.  When we were going up to the cabins, that's where I got my first glimpse of Steve since Maine. Holy shit he's fucking hott... lol. Now, he was with Elijah and Nate, and we waved, and they waved back and then kinda... ran... cuz they're shy and stupid. Heh... it was quite funny, cuz I never think of guys of being afraid... and Carol (Carol is one of our confermation class leaders, along with Pastor Merkel) starts talking... "Oh, ignore them... they're shy and afraid..." and I was like... wow... they really are... lol. I find that quite strange.  Later we got reaquainted with them, and with some other people from Maine. We also met Elise. There's two Elises. Elise from Maine, and Elise from Connecticut. They're both cool and they are now both friends.  Day 2. Got closer with everyone, and got used to being away. This day seemed like the longest... ever. We went on the pontoon boat ride, (I know I spelled that wrong), and I was in heaven for 45 minutes because I sat across from Steve the entire time and oooomggggg he looked sooo fucking hottt.... lol. What? HE IS! Hehe. ((Pssst I still like Jay more, lol))  Everything started coming together today and I got to be so happy. The songs and services and skits they put on were all annoying as Hell, but it didn't matter because everything was actually okay. Elise(Maine), I realized, was good friends with Steve and getting closer to him- which hurt at first but I brushed it off because know what? I love someone... Jay. Crushes don't matter. Steve is just really fucking hott, and at this point I barely knew him so I couldn't even tell if I really liked him yet. So it didn't matter... AND I'M NOT EVEN BEING SARCASTIC! :O! Heh.  Day 3. Day of the shirts. Ya know how if a guy is really really hott he looks even better if he's in a really dressy shirt? Both Steve and Elijah were in dressy shirts. And Laurel and I were like... "THE HEAVENLY VOICES ON HIIIIGHH!!!" lmao... Anyway, coincidentally, today I also ended up being around Steve a lot more, THANKS TO LAUREL, and I was nervous and about to fucking faint. No, not a good thing... heh.  I was up playing basketball, practicing, with Laurel. And Steve comes and starts to practice... AND LAUREL LEFT ME. And in a way I wanted to run up and hug her, and in a way I wanted to fucking strangle the life out of her. Well, me and Steve were practicing for the better part of an hour, and I didn't say a word. Hah, I'm stupid. Then, he left. And in about a half an hour Pastor Merkel wondered where the Hell I was and Laurel came to get me.   And again, I was made nervous by Laurel.. at lunch. Bethesda/Grace churches had two or three tables, but there was only one with two seats left when me and Laurel came in a little late. They were on one side of Steve. One was next to him and one was the next one over. Laurel took the next one over. Once again, I wanted to hug her and shoot her at the same time. But throughout the whole time, it felt like he was just as nervous as I was... and, you see, these chairs were really close, and his leg kept touching mine... and one of those times he left it there... *blushes all bright* lol... that was a good time.  And throughout the rest of that day, I was able to talk to him so much and I did... and I got to know him... and grew to like him... a lot. But I realized something, that sucks. A lot. I can be somewhere else and forget about my worries at home, and then somewhere in the middle I always think about them. I still love Jay, and I can't like Steve and just completely forget about Jay. Though, I do want to forget about it because he would never like me back and all that happy shit. And at that point, yes, I had a crush on Steve. But... I love Jay and therefore that little crush stayed just a little crush. And he's really fucking hott. Hehe. :-D.   And here was the throwing of the shotput-rocky-thing that gets it's own paragraph cuz it was all like "Whoa" lol. See, Steve coaches track. ((Ooooomg what I wouldn't give to see that one day))... And he found a rock about the size of a shotput, because Jerry (another advisor dude) wanted to see how far he could throw one. He threw it fucking thirty feet... and I was invited to watch :-D. And Elise wasn't. Hehehehe :-D. Lmao...   Day 4. This is the depressing day because we left... so I shall not say any more about it.  Well, that was camp. And now I am done. Cuz this is getting long... lol. Byeee......  --Lizz ((It's been a long dark lonely hall, Between the cracks I can read the scrawl.. It's written down in a crooked rhyme...

      In breif I'll explain the bad thing(s). Taylor sent me an email. ((Happy happy, Joy, joy.)) I wrote back before I realized that she sent another... which said (also in brief... breif? brief? Goddamned spelling) that she wasn't reading or responding to any response I made to her. Childish stuff. But throughout the letter I was calm. But then I broke. And then I called Anthony. And he made everything a bit better. **note to self** Must thank him. Again.  I don't know where this mood came from, and I don't know whether it's good or bad. I think it's not. I feel like I'm in the calm after a storm, when everything feels new, washed... how the rain leaves every blade of grass after the dew of the morning. I just got home from camp, and if I was still in my 'normal' state of mind, I'm sure I'd be sleeping until twelve tomarrow. But as is, I think I may watch the sunrise. That's the kind of mood I'm in. Kinda sunrise-ish watching water on the beach kind of mood. I just noticed I can spend a very long time explaining my moods. Eh.  Well, as I said, I'm calm. Strangely enough, at camp, there was actually a very big storm. And everything after the storm seemed so different than how I associate the 'after-storm' feeling now. Not new, not clean-washed... but alive.  I was at Camp Calumet. For religon. And now I have the songs stuck in my head, but strangely enough everything still seems so relaxed. And I normally can't deal with religious songs, either. I don't know what suddenly brought on this calm. Maybe it was the being away from home for four days, and everything seeming... different. Like somehow I'm not home and I'm not whole. But though I don't feel whole, I don't feel the opposite, either. And though I don't feel home, I don't feel like I'm that far away. I don't know if I still feel so 'alone'. I don't think that's my big problem anymore. I don't think anything is... or, I think there's something, but it's something I don't need to find or conquer right now.  I remember watching the water. At camp, there was a lake... Lake Ossopee, I think. When everyone was swimming, there were moments when I felt this same calm. But throughout most of that trip I was still... me. And now I feel like I'm... not someone different, but... I wasn't like this. I don't know. But I don't think I need to...  Camp overall (more detailed version will follow when I'm feeling more... storytellerish...)- Hott guys, sunburn, friends who I haven't seen forever, horrible food, finally an opportunity to ride in a boat again, suggestions to conga dance in the mall, Steve- who I have liked for some time but haven't really mentioned because I don't see him often (I wish Maine was closer to CT), loss of camera film, Beatles music, annoying people, and some very very cool ones that I've only recently gotten to know. Oh yeah- and people with very cool hair. And my hippie pants. And very aching joints.  I don't know how to sum up today. But... I was... alive. Before I only existed. I think that I lived... and maybe now I an figure out who I am and who I want to be. And I'm not depressed. I'm not happy. I'm not angry. I'm not even content. I'm not good, and I'm not bad. I'm... I'll have to get back to you on that.  --Lizz ((Good and bad, I defined these terms, Too serious, too soon...))

       I just realized how incredibly psychotic that title can sound. Eh, oh well... hehe. But the main point of this (Which I have realized to be a pretty pitiful main point, when you realize all that's going on in the world...) is that I emailed Mike. YAY! Heh, big step up from "He's not online... *sulk*"... which is what I've ended up getting used to whenever there was a guy that I liked that I wanted to get back in touch with... like Nick... but you don't know who Nick is... and that was such a random thought that I should kill it right now before I end up explaining the whole story with Nick that depresses me and makes me happy at the same time but mostly just puts me into complete reverie but somewhat not good reverie and OKAY I'M GONNA STOP RAMBLING!      There is another main part of this entry. I really think my crush on Jay died. And also, I think the one on Mike did too. But I miss him cuz he was cool and he's still my friend, regardless. AND HOW CAN WE LET THE SPIDER CRAB JUMPING JOKE DIE? Hehe. Well.. I'm gonna go. Bye-ness.      --Lizz

       Okay, so today was my last day of camp. It doesn't feel like it was. It feels like I'm gonna see Mike... I mean go back on the boat (har-de-har) tomorrow, and yet I know I'm not. I keep forgetting that, though. Quite annoying. I hate to say it, but I know that I like(d... make it liked, please?) Mike, and BAAAAH! However, I do have his screenname, and I know he goes to other states a lot for concerts, and that he's been to the Space before- so who knows? He could be there one day when I am. Maybe. Please? Eh... I don't know... I feel so frustrated and so confused and I want to talk to Anthony and I want him to know that I still like him and yet I want to be free to tell him everything about Mike and I don't know how to explain that... I want to be so much more free with him than I am but I don't think I can do that. WHY DO I LIKE SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN MASSACHUSETTS?? Whatever... it doesn't matter... stupid things, right? I'm only thinking of little insignificant stupid things when there is stuff that is so much more important...       But the main point to this entry is that... I don't know what the main point of this entry is. I feel like telling you about what happened today. So now I will.       Okay, first of all you need to know who people are.   Andrew- He was really quiet at first, but I made him talk... hehe. He's a cool guy, but sometimes I get the impression that I'm not really his favorite person in the world. I know that he doesn't hate me, and that he considers me his... uh... friend? That he just met? That lives more than 20 minutes away? Something like that...   Mike you know. He's an awesome guy, and I never get the impression that he hates me or even slightly dislikes me. And that's a good thing... a really good thing. Living in Massachusetts is the only downside. It SUCKS. Even he admits that... lol. He didn't want to leave either, and it seems as if he didn't realize it was the last day until, well, the end. And I'm gonna stop droning on now...   Terris- Annoying as Hell, and bent on world domination. That's all you need to know.   Alex- She is even more annoying than Terris, partially because she assumes that I'm her new best friend. She has a sister, Jesse, who is exactly like her. As I said... she kinda assumes that I'm her little puppet and that I completely love her. She's also quite stupid when it comes to taking hints, and not to be blunt, but I hope she jumps off the boat and we DON'T ever go back for her.   Sam, Andy, James, JC, Brittany, Jay (har-de-har, yes, his name is Jay), and Ian are counselors. Captain John is... well... captain. Haio is the substitute captain, who was here on Tuesday and Wednesday.   Muriel is a coolful person.      I think that's all the people you need to know for me to tell you what happened today. We had a waterfight with the Phoenix, another boat that holds campers in the age group younger than us. We won... but the won't admit it. ARGH! Har-har. We stole their Jolly Roger flag!!! Teehee. I didn't really participate, because I had no watergun. Alex offered me one, but I found it better not to accept anything from her and encourage her idea of me as her new best friend. The freakin' girl is eleven... HAHA I'M ACTUALLY FOURTEEN NOW! I found out Mike is turning fourteen on October 14th, and Andrew is only eleven days older than I am (July 23rd). Yesterday was the open house on the boat, and Mike dropped the spider crab... twice. Well, the second time it was technichally me who dropped it, but it was HIS fault! Hehe... whatever. AND HE SPLASHED ME! Well, I did hit him... but that was like an hour beforehand! And he was being a jerk! *muttermutter* stupid mike... annoying... bob dylan... ignore me... *mutter*... lol. HE KEEPS TAUNTING ME! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! I got a few pictures of him yesterday... well, he got me to take them... more like jumped into or got pulled into them by Sam, lol.      Today I almost killed Alex (and Jesse, who is like her shadow). Take note that I did NOT tell her I like Mike, mostly because I don't trust her and because that is something that I would only tell FRIENDS... good ones. Well, what happened is that me and Mike and Andrew were talking about random shit, with Muriel randomly jumping in. Andrew was standing up, and me and Mike were sitting on the cabintop. We had just finished lunch, and Alex and Jesse were randomly being stupid and ANNOYING, and wouldn't shut up. But that wasn't why I wanted to hurt her (Badly. VERY badly.). Alex got up and sat down between me and Mike (More accurately squeezed herself into that place, because it wasn't very big...) and says "I'll be breaking up these two lovebirds now..." GRF! Mike just kinda... sat there... and avoided eye contact... lol. So basically she made everything SO awkward... but something good happened afterword.  Me and Mike and Andrew were talking again, this time closer to the bow of the boat so Alex and Jesse wouldn't find us as easily (Harder to see the area near the bow from where they were). Andrew was standing again, and me and Mike were sitting on the PFD (Life Jacket) box. But Alex saw us and came up to us... again. She tried to sit between us again (After having figured out that I like him, because of my goddamned obvious reaction), only this time she couldn't fit, because Mike moved closer and says "Go find somewhere else"... :-D. Then (More because of the little amount of room than Mike's remark) she walked away, and reappeared behind us with her elbows on Mike's shoulders. And then (teeeheeee lol) he pushes her off (Rather annoyed) and says "Okay, Alex, we DON'T want you here!"... :-D.  Okay this post is getting long so I think I'm gonna end it before I just start ranting on and on and on and on and on and... I think you get the idea.      BYE!!      --Lizz   ((And how can I stand here with you,   And not be moved by you?   Could you tell me,   How could it be,   Any better than this?))

        I've been going to camp for this past week, starting Monday and ending tomorrow. The camp is on a boat, and aside from today the days are bright as all Hell. Today it was cold, and windy, and while everyone else could grab their sweatshirts and coats, I have on right now a short-sleeved Dropkick Murphys shirt, which I've had all day. In absence of a coat, I shuddered. A lot. It didn't help.      This is random, but I did tell you Anthony is gone until the 9th, correct? Eh... random-full-ness.      Well, on the first day I met... dun dun dun... a guy. Surprise, surprise. I always end up meeting SOMEONE on that boat, and barely do I ever see or hear from them again. I consider these random summer crushes; they never add up to anything, not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Some things you just need to have fun with, and not worry about what will happen in the future. Anyway, the guy is named Mike, and I have one more day with him. I don't know whether to be relieved or sad because of that. In a way, it should be a relief. Without seeing him every day, I don't need to think about liking yet another guy, and I don't need a constant reminder that "summer crushes" are annoying and actually quite pointless. But in another way, I want to see him... I want to see him every day and I don't want it to be a stupid summer crush. So... as used to me saying this as you are, I don't know.      I have serious sunburn, both on my arms and on my face. My ears hurt like Hell from getting peirced yesterday, my fingers are presently cramped, I was cold to the point of shivering today, I forgot my sweatshirt, and two of my best friends can't come to my birthday party. Yet I had a good day... a really good day.      --Lizz   ((Maybe the stars know why we fall...   I just wish they were thinking out loud))

       Why hello there.   NO ONE COMMENTS! 'Tis sad. :(.   Well... that COULD be because no one reads this...   Heh.      Alrighty then.   I just went to camp today, and tried my hardest to not think of Anthony every two seconds, without prevail. Well, actually, some of my thoughts were actually on task! It's the sub-thoughts I'm annoyed with. Yes, sub-thoughts. You know, the things you know you're thinking behind whatever you're actually saying in your head. I hate that he's moving and I hate that I still like him, I hate that I can't do anything and at the same time I hate that I want to do something. He's away until the 9th, so I can't talk to him. AND HE HASN'T EMAILED ME BACK YET! I probably didn't send it in time... whatever.      I tried to call him the day before he left, but he either didn't answer or he wasn't home. I dunno... I still love him, but that's kinda... all... that I do know.      Bah. Gotta go. (haha I know that too lol)   BYE!      --Lizz
