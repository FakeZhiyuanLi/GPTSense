      Today 2004-6-29 I proudly launch myself into the air with the siesta hotline  Plans are to have a bit of this and and some of that. (yes that's right mr.) So this is my first post right. Haven't really figured out all those lovely little features of this site but anyway... Suppose this will be fun. I'll try to update this as often as I can. Though not too often..(not like every minute of the day. THAT would be a bit too often.)   Right now im waiting, not very patiently, for two cds I've ordered. I hope both Razorlight and The Streets will be good. And I'm pretty sure the will be...

      Spent some time on Sollenkroka. Most of the time with my ipod, since it was raining. I had just dowloaded the libertines bootleg "piss me off". And it's brilliant.   They played some songs from the new cd (What Katie did, Don't be shy, Can't stand me now, Last post on the bugle, Campaign of hate, man who would be king, and some future b-sides (as Cyclops.  You can donwload it on www.babyshambles.com  I'm going back to blid√∂ now, staying for a few days, coming back on wednesday. A football game is something you shouldn't miss.  Ciao

      Finally a good a hairday. Isn't that what it's all about? Spain killed my hair so I had to put in some creme to get it sorted. And my god, it got sorted allright. I'm walking on clouds now.   Today I got the Razorlight (Upp all night) cd and the new one from the Streets (A grand don't come for free).  I've listened to Razorlight once so far and it's really, really good. Golden touch.  Rock 'n' Roll lies, etc, etc Haven't heard the whole "A grand etc." yet, but from what I've heard it's not as good as his first.    Adios
