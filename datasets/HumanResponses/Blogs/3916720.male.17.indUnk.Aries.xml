      Tuesday Newsday is a bit lackluster, but here it is.  Do you keep up with the news while on vacation or otherwise away from home for an extended period? If so, how (newspaper/tv, etc.)? And has any major news item ever happened while you were out of touch with the news, shocking you when you found out after the fact?  A little. I trust on hearing it from people. When I backpack or canoe I don't at all, otherwise looking at paper headlines. The closest to a big news item was being on an "academic vacation" when Ronald Reagan died. I guess.

      Come on, what's with Congress? Why didn't they pass that amendment to ban gay marriage? Because, let's face it, if we allow same-sex marriages, all the people who are in hetrosexual marriages won't be as sanctified. It might rip apart their family life. And those gays can't be for real? It's obvious it's not serious. That's why it's compromising the sanctity of marriage. Unlike the people who get married for a week in Las Vegas as a spur of the moment thing, no, that's OK. And we all know that those homosexuals just totally want everyone to be like them. Bush and co want everyone to be like them, too -- that's why they're passing this amendment -- but it's OK, because they read it in the Bible. And everyone knows this is a Christian country. When we want to be, of course. I mean, when it comes to treating people as you want to be treated, no way! Are you crazy! We're a non-denominational country here. Hellooo? But bring up gay marriage, and then, well, look in the Bible. We have no state religion, you say? Nonsense! Because, that First Amendment doesn't really apply anymore. Come on, read the Patriot Act. Geez.  That last paragraph was my bad attempt at political sarcasm. Just in case you thought my views had radically changed overnight. Here is the major problem with the "Sanctity of Marriage" laws/amendment: it's inhibiting people's freedoms. There are amendments to protect freedoms, there are amendments to protect people and objects. But if gay marriage is allowed, who is it going to hurt? No one. What if it's banned? Who would it hurt then? A lot of people who love each other and obviously feel strongly enough to fight for the right to marry. Banning gay marriage doesn't protect anyone. Even if you think that being gay is wrong and gays try to force their beliefs onto everyone else, banning gay marriage won't change their sexual orientation. We're supposed to be about understanding and giving everyone the freedom to their beliefs. What happened?

      I wanted to try one of those meme things and found this. It's political, my blog's political... here goes.   1. Is this a fair way to pick a VP? Or might it be more fair to have the person with the second most delegates automatically get the VP slot? Or is there another way to pick a VP that you think would be fair?   Yes, for the most part -- it's like hiring someone to work under you. You don't want to get stuck with someone who you can't work with when you're top banana in the nation. (hee hee -- top banana :)) (what is grammatical rule for doing emoticons in parentheses like last one? anyway...sigh...) No. Then you get into stuff like Adams where they tie and who knows. It stinks working with former competitors. It sounds good at first but I would like to have the choice were I running for pres. This seems like the best way -- other than having me choose it, of course.    2. At one point there were rumors of a Kerry/McCain ticket. As a Democrat who disagrees with most of McCain's views, I wasn't very happy about that. Do you think it's possible to have a split party ticket work?   As a liberal progressive Midwesterner who doesn't pay nearly that much attention to southern politics, I don't really know. I probably would still vote for Kerry -- but then I would vote for a rock if it was against W. McCain did work with Feingold (the greatest senator in the world, the only one with guts enough to vote NO on the PATRIOT Act) on that Campaign Finance Reform, so it might be OK. Though Republicans would totally rip Kerry apart for "not having the courage to choose someone from his own party" etc. Maybe one day it will work. But not this election. It is possible, if they're dynamic and exciting, to have a split ticket work.     3. Does the VP really count for anything? I mean, like, do you know which Presidents had VPs named Alben W. Barkley, Garret A. Hobart or Hannibal Hamlin? Even names you know like Adlai E. Stevenson and Nelson Rockefeller, do you know for whom they were VPs? I know you can look them up on the internet, but did you know, or care?   No, I don't know. No, I don't care. It depends. With Bush, the vice president is everything. They matter more as an issue of charisma and drawing more people in than as a political player once their ticket is elected. But I have the feeling they do a lot behind the scenes. And should the president die... heck, you need someone.   That was tiring :). And a better waste of time than telling you all my favorite movie and such. Now it's off for a walk to break in hiking boots, for next weekend I canoe!

      I no longer know what to think about 9/11. From a list of very interesting questions I've been reading, it seems as if the government knew a lot more than we thought about the terrorist attacks, and has been not telling the truth about what happened to the towers and who the terrorists were. A sampling to get you thinking:   Why have George Bush and Dick Cheney done everything in their power to stop and derail any investigation into the events of 9/11? Why did it take  15 months  for them to agree to an investigation, and why was Henry Kissinger originally appointed to head it? Why did Bush and Cheney refuse to testify separately or under oath? Whhy was the initial budget into investigating the biggest terrorist attack on American soil only $3 million, while  $70 million  was spent in the fruitless investigation into Bill Clinton's real estate deals?  IN SHORT, WHY WOULD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT AND DERAIL ANY INVESTIGATION INTO 9/11 UNLESS THEY HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE?   If the government claims to have no foreknowledge of the attacks, why could they confidently produce a list of the perpetrators ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ATTACKS and even NAME OSAMA BIN LADEN as the perpetrator within 48 hours? Who exactly hijacked the planes, since 7 of the 19 accused hijackers have been found to be alive? Why does the government NOT CARE WHO HIJACKED THE PLANES?  Why, save the still frame of Mohammed Atta, have we NOT SEEN ANY SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE OF THE TERRORISTS IN THE AIRPORTS? Why have we not seen clear security camera footage of the plane crashing into the Pentagon? WOULD THE PENTAGON HAVE NO SECURITY CAMERAS ROLLING?  We are told that the security frame of Atta (and Abdulaziz al-Omari, one of the hijackers who turned up alive) is them at Portland, Maine's airport. They supposedly flew to Logan and then to the WTC. WHY RISK TRANSFERRING FLIGHTS? WHY NOT FLY DIRECT?  WHY DID THE HIJACKERS DRAW SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES? In Logan  Airport, a man remembers arguing with a Middle Eastern man about a parking space. The car was then found to have flight manuals, a Koran, etc. Atta checked in a bag of flight computers, flying manuals, etc. WHY??? IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY THE ONLY BAG NOT TRANSFERRED ONTO HIS NEXT FLIGHT (Flight 11). WHY THIS COINCIDENCE? WHY DID HE PACK SUCH INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE?  Why did the supposed extremist hijackers behave in such an un-Arab manner? The owner of a strip club rembers loud Middle Eastern mean drinking at his club, saying "America will die tomorrow" etc. WHY, WHEN THIS IS VERY UN-MUSLIM BEHAVIOR? WHY RISK GETTING THEMSELVES NOTICED? WHY DID ATTA'S SUICIDE NOTE SEEM TO BE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WITH VERY LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH ISLAM?  HOW DOES A PASSPORT SHOW UP UNHARMED IN THE WTC RUBBLE? Authorities found Satam al-Suqami's passport amidst the rubble. He was flying under a fake ID yet had his real passport. WHY? How did it survive, WHEN THE BLACK BOXES OF ALL OF THE HIJACKED PLANES DID NOT? THEY ARE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND NEARLY ANYTHING.  How did the terrorists do all this with such precision? Their flight school teachers recall them being STUPID WHEN FLYING A PLANE, and this was a prop plane not a 757. One flight instructor remarked, "I'M STILL AMAZED TO THIS DAY THAT HE COULD HAVE FLOWN INTO THE PENTAGON. HE COULD NOT FLY AT ALL."  Why did President Bush NOT LOOK SURPRISED OR SCARED AT ALL? Even if it was to not scare the kids, or because he is a clueless idiot, WHY WERE THE SECRET SERVICE MEN NOT THERE TO TAKE HIM INSTANTLY TO A SECRET LOCATION? DID THEY KNOW HE WOULDN'T GET HARMED? WHY DID HE MOVE TO AIR FORCE 1, NOT A SECRET GROUND LOCATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SAFER?  Why does the tape of bin Laden confessing look different from the real bin Laden. In quotes, bin laden has said he did not do it. No Muslim group has declared responsibility when usually groups are scrambling to get noticed and take credit for terrorist attacks,  This is similar to project NORTHWOODS, which JFK rejected, in which a ship or jet airliner would be destroyed, supposedly by Cuba, which could then be invaded.  and this is just the beginning. The list goes on pointing out problems with the story regarding Afghanistan, the flights being taken over, the Pentagon destruction, the Towers, and more. I may post more, if you really want me to quickly let me know.    I honestly don't know what to think. Sadly, it sounds plausible that our government could do this. But I don't want to think they would. Though there's so many problems with the story we're told..  And no, I haven't seen Farenheit 911, though I really want to.

      I found this in "Citizen You" written by one of the Onion writers, and wanted to share it in the hope it may bring joy to your life also.   Making a Difference -- Eight More Years  Since Presidential Appointee George W. Bush was not officially elected in 2000 but appointed by the Supreme Court, the presidential two-term limit does not apply to his first four years in office. Therefore, we will not have to appoint another Bush family member as president until 2012 -- unless, of course, another major terrorist attack occurs on US soil in which case martial law will be enacted and all bets are off.

      Whoa, whoa, whoa. John Ashcroft and Co. are talking about postponing the elections "should there be a terrorist attack"? Sounds too crazy to be true, I know. But here it is from CNN.com:  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. officials have discussed the idea of postponing Election Day in the event of a terrorist attack on or about that day, a Homeland Security Department spokesman said Sunday. urlLink (See the full story...)   I mean come on. You've already got Diebold, the largest voting machine manufacturer, on your side, not being required to have a paper trail of the votes in many states; if you can't win with that advantage something is wrong. What do you bet everyone in the White House is hoping that this will be OKed, then on Nov. 1st they set up a terrorist threat and raise the security level to ultrared or whatever. George Bush "expertly deals with the threat" and wins in a landslide on the election which is suitably enough time after his popularity soars. It makes me sick.  Speaking of which, there's some evidence that 9/11 didn't happen like we thought. More on this later.

      So it's my first real blog post. How awesome. For the most part, I'll be talking politics and opinions here but as my mind deviates you may see some Apple fanaticism, random thoughts, etc. Comments welcome, if anything is grossly wrong with this please bear with me, I've never used this before and I have no idea how easy it will be to use.  And please, no swearing at the blogmaster. . . this is a biased post and I recognize that. It's a sort of 1 web page surrounded by reality (Madisonians will understand that...   About Madison, WI  Madison is a great place to live. We like to brag about it, but also like to keep quiet about it so that the city does not become too popular or overcrowded. It's been called "78 Square Miles Surrounded By Reality".   Without further ado, here I go.  P.S. I just found out that the blogger spellcheck doesn't recognize the word BLOG. How stupid.
