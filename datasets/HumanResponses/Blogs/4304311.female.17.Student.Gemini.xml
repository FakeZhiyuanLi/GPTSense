       she told me last night she was a member. I think her dumb butt did what dedra began to do; click create a BLOG instead of create a post. good grief. im going to have to search out there in blogger land for her. jeeeeezzziiisssss. On a lighter note, im talking to someone new. His name is Lou, and hes a dj on the edge. He gave me his phone number, and told me he wants us to go to putt putt. turns out hes a huge golf fanatic. who knew. (jeez, can i pick em!) Nice harry stuff, code. nice. deege, start reading the blog every day, HAG.

      The first Harry Potter book,  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , was originally titles  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone .  It was apparently changed because American kids are too stupid to comprehend what a philosopher is.  Below is a list of further retitling of the Harry Potter series:   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  will become  Harry Potter and the Teacher's Rock   Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  will become  Harry Potter and the Room He Couldn't Find...Until Later   Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban  will become  Harry Potter and the Guy in Jail   Harry Potter and the Goblet  will become  Harry Potter and the Hot Cup   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  will become  Harry Potter and the Bird Group              By the way, if you haven't figured out that this is a joke, then it amazes me you managed to find this site.

       The Jack White thing was because I have a poster of him hanging above my computer, and I have a large tendency to do badness --- my computer faces my bed, thusly does Sir White. And in this picture hes wearing a scolding expression. So yeah. Use your imagination. He's also sitting in a very high backed chair, which gives off throne-esque vibes. Hey ,  IM HOLDING A POLL  . i want to invite manny, the guy i met at the ac party on here. Post your yea's or nay's. RELATIVELY SOON, IF YOU PLEASE.
