      I wonder who decided to tear up Thorndike St the day before memorial day weekend? Oh and did you know they were supposed to have 3 lanes open on Rt 3 by the end of May? I'm thinking they're not going to meet that deadline...

      OK EVERYONE..maybe you are all sick of hearing about Spook this Spook that but I have to vent...I am a nervous wreck about Spook going to the doctors on Thursday. He needs to have some teeth pulled.  It's a no win situation.  Taking him in to have some teeth pulled runs risks because he has a heart murmur and he's 19.  The doctor mentioned he'd be using gas instead of anestesia because it will be less of a risk.  Spook will also wake up a lot sooner from the gas than he would from anestesia.  What makes me feel good about this is the people on my support group (Yes, I found an online group support site for cats with Kidney Failure (CRF), think of me what you will) also suggested the vet use gas for this.  One person wrote that their cat was 20 1/2 when he had it done and was in the same situation Spook is in and he was fine after. If I don't have the teeth pulled then what he swallows from the infection will worsen his kidneys because they won't be able to flush out the bad stuff...  I just want to cry so bad right not but I'm trying not to because I'm at work and I don't want to cry in front of Spook because I don't want him to think I'm upset.  I shouldn't even be thinking negatively and I'm trying not to...I want to be positive and believe he will come out of this ok!!!!  He has to...  Gotta go now...my eyes are starting to drip :(

      So... I'm standing in the hallway at the YMCA talking to Krista, and I hear a voice behind me say "is that Dave Whelan?" so I turn around and the guy is looking at me and when he sees my face he says "Oh you're not Dave". Somebody put me out of my misery.

      Hi everyone!  I had a great weekend but it's good to be home. I hope everyone here stayed warm and had a fun time while I was gone. Maggie must have missed me because she's been all over me since I got home, wanting to be petted and she keeps licking my nose.  Here's a picture of Hannah and Joe with my friend Blair. It was taken this weekend at my ex-wife's graduation. Sometime since Christmas Hannah has started wearing mascara...hmm. Not sure how I feel about that!

      I woke up with a headache, gave myself 20 minutes to shower, iron my clothes and get dressed before I had to run to catch the train.  This leaves me with no socks because I didn't want to take that extra 15 seconds to put them on.  It also left me without an umbrella because I just didn't think to grab one of the 75 I have.  Good thing I have one at work.  I fell asleep on the train (David makes a comfy pillow).  Next thing I know we're in Boston and David's waking me up!  I was comfortable...We started walking to work when the rain started pouring down so we took a few steps back and got on the T.  Luckily the rain stopped by the time I got off the T so I was able to stop and get my maple scone at Starbucks to make me feel better.  I have a sinus headache!!!!  It hurts!!!  So far I took my clariton, my flonase, a couple sudafed and 4 advil to try to get rid of it...hopefully something will kick in soon.  Other than that I'm going to try for a great day!    Hopefully I'll also get to leave early today so I can get Spook to the doctor's.  He's being moody lately and I don't like it!  He even hissed at me yesterday!  This morning though he was happy as peaches and cream when I woke up!  Probably because he knew he was getting the house to himself!

      I just went outside and it's wicked hot! Is that rumor that the pool is opening this w/e true? Not that I will be around to enjoy it but just curious. I can't wait. I gotta go check and make sure my raft is properly inflated. I think my raft and my cooler are going to get lots of use this summah.

      So I wake up this morning all comfy in my bed with Maggie snuggled up next to me. Hmmm... I woke up b4 the alarm went off? Gee... it's really light out this morning. Look at the clock. F! I overslept. I never set the alarm! Jump out of bed... it's 6:53. I normally get up at 5:30 to be at work by 7:00. Brush teeth, put on deodorant clean clothes and a baseball cap and run out the door. Got to work at like 7:50. So that's twice I've been late to work this week. Nice example I'm setting for the guys that work for me. Blah.

      The guys that work for me are a bunch of characters. The youngest one found out yesterday about the old myth that supposedly nobody can drink an entire gallon of milk in an hour. Yep. You guessed it. He showed up today with a gallon of milk! He started off strong and then slowed down to a crawl. He lost the bet because he could not finish it in the hour. Here's the even stupider part. He went ahead and finished it afterwards, just so he could say that he had, even tho he had already lost the money. He did manage to chug the remainder of the gallon and was all proud of himself. Then about 10 seconds later he was running to the bathroom and he hurled it all up.

      Okay, so after five tries I finally was able to create a username that is acceptable. Now I guess I get to figure out how this thing works. The first time I felt my age was when I heard an advertisment on television that was a compliation of music from the 80's that I wanted to purchase because I knew every song. Now again, I am in that same position, trying to figure out what I am doing.....grin. Oh, and Mike "Butter Chunk", the only problem I see with the potatoe chips for dinner after attending the Y is that you forgot the dip. That is the best part. AFP can attest to my stand on that....Eggy

      Ok so great. I have a blog. What do I do with it? Well I guess there are three options. 1.  Have this as my personal blog . Kind of a stupid idea since I picked Keith Academy as a title. Also... do I really  need  to have my own blog? I mean... I don't really act like it, but I  am  a 41 year old man and I think blogs are more of a 20 something year old girl thing. And what the hell would I talk about? The other question is... How much more time can I really spend not concentrating on work when I'm at work? 2.  Have this be an open blog about Keith Academy or whatever . Anyone could post anything about everything. Sort of an underground version of the Yahoo group. The nice thing is, you don't get an email every time someone posts. You have to check the web site periodically to see if anyone has written anything. Could get ugly depending on who gets involved.  3.  Have this be a members only blog for my friends at KA.  Could be fun if I can figure out how to make it password protected so that only we could look at it. Could cut down on the number of emails we have to send around too.   I dunno... what do people think? I guess if I don't get any comments that will answer my question.

      I got into work this morning from taking 2 days off and I was going through my emails and I came across one that said "Andrea, I recieved notice you will be in the Marlboro office during the Democratic convention.  Let me know if you need any additional setting to your computer"  So I fowarded that to my boss with a "What?" attached.  Then I was going further through my emails and I recieved an email that said "Andrea, your number has been changed from 5171 to 5123" So I forwarded that to my boss with a "Huh?" attached because apparently I"m going to be sitting up at a reception desk.  This just reaffirms the LACK OF COMMUNICATION WE HAVE IN OUR LITTLE WORK GROUP!!!!!

      for being home this morning so I could get your car keys and get my wallet that I had left in the back seat of your car. Without it I had no money and there was zero gas in my car. I wouldn't have been able to go to work today! Wait a minute... This would have been a bad thing? I could have "worked from home" which is also known as "hanging at the pool all day".

      Stolen from www.bash.org    Purely in the interests of science, I have replaced the word "wand" with "wang" in the first Harry Potter Book   Let's see the results...    "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry.   "Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wang in half an' everything    A magic wang... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.    "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wang. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wang for charm work."   "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wang. Eleven inches. "    Harry took the wang. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wang above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls    "Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wang, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"    The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.    He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.    He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.    Ok   I have found, definitive proof   that J.K Rowling is a dirty DIRTY woman, making a fool of us all   "Yes," Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to... or did he?    Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wang    Then, with a sigh, he raised his wang and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.    'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncles sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wang.

      Racquetball. I gotta say... it's fun. Beats the crap out of an hour on the elliptical. And it makes you sweat like a ho in church. I think we did pretty well considering it was our first time. Thankfully nobody was watching through the window except this one time I looked back and this elderly gentleman was watching us and of course I totally missed the ball and then he walked away in disgust. I wonder if people wear mouth guards when they play because I have this horrible fear that I'm going to hit Egg in the face. For those of you scoring at home, he beat me in 4 out of 5 games.

      I noticed this morning that the compass in my car is totally F-ed up. I use my compass a lot when I'm trying to find my way somewhere on back roads, like today when Rt 3 South was backed up to the Rt 62 exit. In the owners manual it tells you how to recalibrate the compass. You have to go to a parking lot and drive the car around in circles and somehow the thing magically finds North again. So.... I guess tonight I'll be looking for a good place to do donuts. Hee.

      What do you call the balls with which you play racquet ball? When I asked a clerk for them at Walmart I asked him for "racquet ball balls". I felt like an idiot and the look I got from the Walmart guy confirmed this. He went and looked for them and confirmed that they indeed had none. He informed me that they "either never had them or were out of them" which I found extremely helpful. So why would they have racquet ball racquets (which sounds normal when you say it out loud) but not sell racquet ball balls? So... Eggy and I now own racquets and we have a reservation to play tomorrow, but we got no balls.

      If any of you take the exit ramp that goes from the Lowell connector on to Rt 3 south you may have seen this. I just noticed it on my drive in to work this morning. Someone spray painted some graffiti on the jersey barriers on the ramp. It says in big red letters "Nixon Still Sucks". I think it's redic! I mean... granted he is a little annoying when he won't stop barking at you while you're trying to watch TV.... but I don't think it's appropriate to say he sucks! Geez!

      Am I being too picky when I talk to my fellow board members about finding a cleaning company that cleans?  I did what they challenged me to do, "Find other cleaning companies that do what Fred does for what he charges..."    I did!  I found 4 cleaning companies out of the 5 I have spoken with and come by who will do MORE for either the same amount or less...  I brought this up to my fellow board members and now they all think I'm being hard on poor Fred and I'm just too eager to terminate him....no....I JUST WANT TO LIVE IN A CLEAN BUILDING and like I said in one of the emails to them "have a maintenance company who won't paint FLAT over EGGSHELL!!!!!!  Sorry...just had to vent...

      Okay - sometimes I wonder if God decided to play a big joke when he gave me my sense of humor...there are many times when I here something that makes a connection in my head that makes me laugh (a LOT) - so I'll look over at Brenda and say the bit that made me laugh so hard - she'll start to laugh for a second and then stop and look at me like I'm loony...I still can't tell if she's being mean to me or if she's giving me polite laughter for a few seconds...  okay - enough silliness...

      Well - I was offered the position at Analogic for a minor pay cut.  As fun as the position would be I rejected the offer and asked for more money...but at least now I know the approximate amount of time I'll need to find a new job...something on the order of 2 months... Rich was offered a similar position at Genzyme, and he also turned them down - again, 2 months...  BTW - we watched the premier for last comic standing yesterday - pretty damn funny with only a few of the Matt W's...I was very surprised.    Hmm - it's 10:15 - I've been in for over an hour and haven't done anything prodcutive (except read all of the blog messages from the last 7 days - very important to stay on top of the blog)...so I suppose I should go and stare at my computer screen for a while...

Me and Ka-rista are thinking about going and having lo-carb pregame drinks at her house before going out. They are a really fun band to watch and they are great to dance to, so let's all go burn some calories and then blow off going to the YMCA the next day!

      On this diet when it says we are allowed one drink with caffiene does that allow more than one cup of tea since everything else has more caffiene than tea?  And yes tea does have more caffiene than coffee by the pound but coffee has more caffiene than teay by the cup (a little knowledge from my many years at Dunkin Donuts for you).  Day 4 is not as bad as the first 3, gotta be honest!

      Alright, this blog is not macintosh friendly. I can create comments and view comments but I can't comment on anyone else's. So, what does this mean? Either that Macs suck or the world has conspired against me!!!! As for the name acronym generator thingy - wtf? I knew my name sucked before they told me I am bright, responsible, elitist, neat, dirty and ambitious. I am not sure if I should be offended or run around the office with my arms up in the air doing victory laps. Whatever the case, this has been a very crappy day and although I am not even on the diet, someone raided my snack drawer and I am now starving!

Poor Loo has to deal with my carbaholic cupboard now on a daily basis :(  Oh, to the guy (dunno your name) walking your corgie (sooo cute) and saw me fall on my face moving stuff in - I'm not usually that clumsy! ;o  Sorry Jimbo and I didn't make your bbq on Sunday!

      I didn't start the South Beach today (Tuesday) because I was 1) sick still and wanted comfort food and 2) had no food other than carbs in my house.  I'm going to the grocery store on Wednesday night, so I'm starting on Thursday. I'll only be 2 days behind you.

      Hey I thought that was wicked fun even though it was a lot of working bringing everything outside and then hauling everything back in. Should we do movies on a regular basis? Is that projector readily available or should we look into buying one? How much does one cost? I have some Best Buy gift certs that I would kick in and I'd throw in some cash. I'll keep my eye out for a king size plain white sheet at Marshall's. Wasn't the sound system awesome? I wonder if we bothered anyone? Did that guy really jump in the pool with his clothes on or did I imagine it?

      I just thought I would share my moment of profound awareness about how exactly stupid I can be. I got in at 7:30am this morning even though I didn't want to because I thought that my ex-roommate was coming to stay with Brian and myself today but, it turns out that she and her boyfriend aren't coming till the 1st of July. Oops! Seeing that Brian and I spent ages cleaning last night (even though he really wanted to relax because he has an interview this morning), I think that I might soon be an incredibly dead me. So, pass me the crown for the moments I have remaining please and thank you. =(

I've already spilled scrambled eggs all over my suit jacket AKA: my jacket for the day AKA: the jacket I'm going to have to wear home covered in scrambled egg juice.  I broke my umbrella.  I went to CVS and bought skim milk to put into my DECAF tea and bought said required oatmeal for this diet since I can't have my sugar filled individual packs!  I stubbed my toe.  All I want is some caffeine!!!! PLEASE CAN I HAVE SOME??????????????  If I want to eat like the people on South Beach I'll move to South Beach!  Thank GOD my work has Splenda!  I can do this...it's only 14 days...less than that now.  I'm 2 hours into it already...I'm thinking I'm going to have to create my own private blog site for my venting escapades :/

So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes, then bend over to the front and touch your toes. I left the jag and I took the roles, if they aint cutting then I put em on foot patrol. How you like me now, when my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand, Lets drank you the one to please, Ludacris fill cups like double d's. Me and Ursh once more and we leave em dead, we want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed

      Last night he was sitting by his food not eating it.&nbsp; I know the scenerio. I've seen it before so I said to him ,"Spook if you're going to have a seizure you better have one now because I don't want you to have one while I'm sleeping or at work tomorrow!" So he was a good boy and had a seizure right then!&nbsp; He's better now though.&nbsp; I hugged him and held him and we snuggled together and I brought his food upstairs so now he's getting even more spoiled than he already is!

      A college professor was doing a study testing the senses of first&nbsp;graders, using a bowl of lifesavers. He gave all the children the same kind of&nbsp;lifesavers, one at a time, and asked them to identify them by color and&nbsp;flavor. The children began to say: "Red...........cherry," "Yellow.........lemon,"> "Green...........lime," "Orange........orange." Finally the professor gave them all honey lifesavers. After eating&nbsp; them for a few moments none of the children could identify&nbsp;the taste. "Well," he said "I'll give you all a clue. It's what your mother&nbsp;may sometimes call your father." One little girl looked up in horror, spit hers out and yelled: "Oh My God!!!! They're assholes!"

      This is a lot to ask but I wonder if some kind soul would be willing to drive me to the Manchester airport very early in the morning next Saturday the 31st.&nbsp; I would need to leave KA at about 5:30 AM.&nbsp; That's a disgusting time to have to be up on a Saturday morning. I need a ride because I am flying one-way to Chicago and then driving back. Anyone.....? Anyone....? Bueller....? Bueller....?

      It's great to have some fresh blood on here. I invited you a long time ago when I started this, but you must have missed the invitation. I also invited Cindy R last night, so hopefully we will see her on here soon. Regarding the KA ghost issue... I've never seen any evidence, but right after I moved in I was talking to some people at the pool about it. I'm sure you remember Dan and Nancy and Kathy and Steve that used to hang out at the pool all the time... They were all convinced that KA is definitely haunted. Kathy said the elevator used to always open whenever she would walk out into the hallway and the others said their cats used to freak out all of a sudden for no apparent reason. My girlfriend at the time was there and it freaked her out so much that she didn't want to sleep over for a couple of days.  &nbsp;Oh by the way... thanks for turning me on to the band Soulive. I had a date last night and I took her to see them at The Paradise. They were friggin awesome. The place was jammed with people and hot as a sauna but we still had a good time. We found a place to stand that was right next to an AC duct.

      An airline's passenger cabin was being served by an obviously gay flight attendant, who seemed to put everyone into a good mood as he served them food and drinks. As the plane prepared to descend, he came down the aisle and announced to the passengers, "Captain Marvey has asked me to announce that he'll be landing the big, scary plane shortly, lovely people, so if you could just put up your trays, that would be super."   On his trip back up the aisle, he noticed that a well-dressed, rather exotic looking woman hadn't moved a muscle. "Perhaps you didn't hear me over those big brute engines. I asked you to raise your trazy-poo so the main man can pitty-pat us on the ground."   She calmly turned her head and said, "In my country, I am called a Princess. I take orders from no one."   To which the flight attendant replied, without missing a beat, "Well, sweet-cheeks, in my country, I'm called a Queen, so I outrank you......Tray up, bitch."

      C.F.: "Guess what, I'm not resigning so get over it, muthah-fuckas. I'm the queen of this g.d. castle."  D.S. : "As a level three wizard I represent The Borg as a whole, not the owners as a group.  What this means is I have to make decisions that are in the best interests of The Borg and not necessarily in the best interests of the owners. Now, I know that doesn't sound right because the owners have been assimilated and are part of The Borg right?, but that is not actually true. The owners individually have tried to challenge me and are in danger of me using my level three wizard powers to cast a mind control spell on them. "  Ok... I may have paraphrased a bit.

       Planes Trains and Automobiles and Trucks and Subways  Should be the title of my trip. I started off flying to Chicago EARLY Saturday morning and thank you again AFP for driving me to the airport and caring for the Magster. I got into Midway at about 9 AM Central and got picked up by my Ex and Hannah. Went straight to the house and thankfully the truck was already loaded and ready to go. Jumped in and started heading East. Got to my Mom's house in Ohio at about 5:30 PM. Barely had time to have dinner and talk to my brother before I was ready to climb into my old bed for some much needed ZZZzzzzs. Left Mom's Sunday morning at about 9:30. and headed East again. Let me tell you.... PA is a LOOOOOOOONG mo-fo state. It seemed like we were never going to get through it. Somewhere along the way I found out on the cell phone from my Ex that not only had I signed on to drive... she was also expecting me to help unload the stuff at my ex-house on the cape on Monday. So I had THAT to look forward to. So anyway... I never thought I would be so happy to finally see New Jersey. Actually, unlike most of NJ, the part that you enter on RT 80 from PA is quite beautiful. The area is called the Delaware Water Gap. So... after that it was over the Tappan Zee Bridge and through CT on Rt 95 and then the long trek from Providence to the Cape on 195. Actually that's not that far, but because it was the last leg of the trip it seemed like forever. It's really hard to drive a big truck so far. It's not like a car where you can put it in cruise control and kinda zone out. You have to be paying attention every second. I found myself wondering how guys that do long hauls for a living can do it? Anyway... got into Harwich at 12:30 AM and went to sleep as soon as possible. Unfortunately I had to sleep on an air mattress because all the furniture was still in the truck. I could not BELIEVE when my Ex sent the kids to wake me up at 7:30 in the fricken AM! I wanted to cry. I got up and went to work unloading, with one other guy and the kids. I sweated my whatever off until about noon and then I had enough. I could have gotten a ride home from her friend if I had stayed until the night time, but I REALLY wanted to get back to KA and I knew she had some other people coming over later to help bring the boxes and small stuff in from the lawn. So... I drove the truck to where it needed to be dropped off in Hyannis and had her drop me off at the bus station. I ran into my old roommate from right after I got separated at the restaraunt near the bus station and it was very cool to see him. The bus ride to South station was nice. Very comfy and I took a nap. Then the Red line to the Green Line to North Station and the train home. I keep thinking... if only I had taken a boat and rode a camel, I would have covered all bases this weekend. Respectfully submitted, Butterchunk
