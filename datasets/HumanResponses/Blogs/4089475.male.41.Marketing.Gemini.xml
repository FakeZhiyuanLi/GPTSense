      I get this one a lot. "I am transferring my lubricants between drum and the machine, is there a way to prevent the oil from being contaminated prior to it entering the machine?"  The answer is yes, oil like all other items lying around in the shop gets dirty, dust and debris enter the oil in the fill container then the operator installs the dirt and debris into the machine on the next fill.  I recommend using a sealed container for filling equipment. These types of containers prevent contamination from entering the oil before it is installed into the equipment.  Many of today's operators are conducting oil analysis with particle count. The contamination that does most of the damage are particles too small to see with the naked eye. If you are conducting oil analysis I strongly urge you to purchase some sealed oil containers for transport to the machine from the drums. Here are some other suggestions for oil storage.     Always store drums inside, even closed drums breath when the temperature changes daily and draws in moisture and debris.  Always re-close containers when done using them to prevent dirt from entering.  Keep your fill containers closed to prevent contamination.  Mark your fill containers to avoid cross contamination, Oil name and brand at a minimum, also place viscosity on the containers when needed.  Color code your containers and fill points to ensure accurate re-filling of machine.  Use Oil Absorbing drum top pads to prevent oil from spilling over tops of drum or from running back into drum carrying the dirt from the drum top into the new oil.  Keep waste oil and waste oil handling equipment in a different storage area to prevent accidental re-use.     The containers we offer here at Ottsen are the Oil Safe Containers.   urlLink Contact Ottsen Oil  to order your today. urlLink          urlLink

      I have been debating how much to charge for the disks? Each disk will have about 100 photos to use and I feel that 25.00 would be a fair amount to ask for each disk. The first disk will be available by the end of August and will contain images of the various flowers that are abundant here in the city's of Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Hiawatha, Iowa. I will have some other disks that I will be working on later on this month that will be available. If you are reading this and wish to purchase a disk please send me payment via Paypal to  urlLink Allanzieser@hotmail.com  for $25.00 and I will send you one. I should have a preview of the disk on my site by the end of this week.  Thanks for reading,  Allan
