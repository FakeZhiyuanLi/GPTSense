      Someone told me recently I look like the character mouse for the Matrix. I did a little background on the actor. His name is Matt Doran. Looking around, I'd say maybe a little bit of a resemblance. I wish I looked more like him, he's hot stuff.   I was checking out the internet radio station EDGE FM and noticed a link for the Layne Staley Tribute. It's a fund for recovering heroin addicts. He was and probably still is my favorite musician. His lyrics are vague yet still powerful. He is never specific, like you don't know who or what situation he is referring to. Most artists convey their pain by giving the play by play..."then the bitch left me for my best friend". Layne would sing "for 10 long years, these leaves to rake up, your love affair has got to go". Maybe he didn't get the fanfare that Kurt Cobain did. In my eyes he was a much greater musician.   urlLink   is a site dedicated to him by his family. Pictures of him growing up and such. It's great that his family setup the fund. Every year they have a tribute for him, and of course all the proceeds go to help addicts.   This day shift schedule I work now is very draining. I have two drinks and pass out at 830. My day's off are spent sleeping, with an occasional run around town lake. I feel asleep saturday night until Stephen and Emily come in my room and started jumping on my bed. We were on 4th for a bit but I was way too tired for any of that. Seemed like everyone I knew would greet me to touching my butt. I'm not a big fan of being touched. I like my personal space. Lately I've been in "please don't touch me" mode. I don't understand it. I'm on the verge of starting to work out. I started rereading order of the phoenix. Seems like reading is a time sink. If not for reading I'd actually clean house or fix my room up or clean my car. No, instead I'm a mess all the way around. Well I'm going to sleep soon.   Cheers

      Today was the first of 5 straight 12 hour work days. Strangely I'm not tired. Although I'm drinking a much deserved vodka/cran. I downloaded one of the coolest song's ever this morning. Angry Johnny by Poe.   I'm looking forward to starting back to school again in the fall. I want to take a writing class. It's amazing that all of my credit is electronics and math. I'm far from an A student. I always excelled at writing papers in high school. Derek is starting back to school. I'm so happy that he didn't wait until he was like in his mid-20's to realize quitting college was a mistake like chris and I did. I want to be a good influence on him.   I watched a video tape of an interview my grandpa did with people from the library of congress. I feel so insignificant compared to him. I mean what am I fighting for? He was in the reserves when the war started. I wonder how I would do in those situation he was exposed to. I look at the despair and hopelessness I've had with friends, relationships, work, and money. None of it compares in the least to what he endured. And yet here I am, bitching like the world has it in for me. It's really humbling.  I think I'm going to Derek's to watch a movie with him. I think one happy side effect of him going back to school is that maybe we can start spending time with each other again. It'll be nice to study together at the coffee shop or my house.  I'm contemplating having a july 4th celebration. Maybe invite a few people over for cocktails and kabob's. I'll have to convince Stephen to be in charge of kabob's (they rock I tell you, ROCK!!). And Saturday is a pool party at Emily Cowley's. I hope I can make it. She is really fun.  Later.....

      I lived through all the father's day stuff. Church was more awful then I remembered. Their call to worship was all "hate what is evil and god will look after you". Then the minister went on and on about bad fathers and second chances. It was depressing. Good thing there are no kiddies in my future. The funny thing was when my autistic little cousin burped twice and farted during a prayer. Then he preached about nepotisism and napolean's brothers. We went back to my grandparents for lunch. I cooked a polenta casserole. I had to explain it was "fancy cornbread" because noone knew what polenta was. My grandpa was a POW in WWII. We watched this interview he had with someone from the library of congress recently. It was powerful, they had to take several breaks in the taping for him.   My little cousins were talking about this video game called America's Army. It was developed by the US army to show kids what being in the military is really like. It's basically a video game that glorifies war and killing. "Looks kids, you can kill evil towel heads like in the game". Not good at all.  The party on saturday night was alright. My roomie was the most attractive guy there. Which is ok because I'm not looking to hookup. I have a few potential dates in line. I'm aiming for people closer to my age. I'm looking forward to maui for sure. I think I want to spend a few days on oahu. That seems to be where the younger crowd lives. Maui is mostly for older retired people. The best flight I found was 722$. I hate spending that kind of money but I deserve the vacation. I think I'll even look for jobs there. My car is almost paid off and I have certain technical skills that would help me along the way.   Derek's on his way over and were going to freebirds. Then I'm hanging with another friend for his birthday later. Then 5 straight days of work....oh my  Cheers

      This weekend is shaping up to be a busy one. First, I have Donny and Anthony in town for the weekend. We are going to the yearly Luau that is always great fun. Donny and I have been friends for about two years (which is like 10 in gay years). He moved home to SA at the beginning of the year and I sorely miss him. People think we used to date the way we nit-pick at each other. We always tease each other but it's in love, or something like that. I hope Anthony is able to go with us. I hope he has fun. I think he will, maybe I'll get him drinking early then the rest of us so he's more happy.   I'm working 60 hours next week. Can't say that I'm excited about it. I do appreciate what it does for my paycheck. Freescale ( urlLink   pays double time after 48 hours. Basically I make as much in a sixty hour week as I normally make in two weeks. I get paid bi-weekly which means 26 paychecks a year (52 weeks/2). Two months a year I get two pay checks and July is one of them. 3 checks next months, plus up to sixty hours a week, times the raise I get on the twenty-eighth of this month equals some fat times in maui. I'm excited.  Thinking of Maui. Last time I was there we stayed at a place called Alaleia (sp?) near Lahiana. The community we rented the condo from had it's own private beach. It was very small with white sand, smooth rocks, and no shells. Noone ever went there except me. My family thought I was depressed because I would always try to watch the sunset alone. I would listen to Mer de Noms (Brena mostly) and meditate. In times of great duress, I try to center myself by thinking of that beach. I'm probably still a canidate for anger management. These have been difficult days, lonely days. The beach has been my place of solace.   My clothes smell like hell-fab and I want to wash the stink of corporate america off.  Regards

      I love to eat. I mean I'm all of about 160lbs over a 6'1 frame isn't bad at all. I made a greek salad for my lunch today. I was invited to go to lunch with the master degree types at Olive Garden. I noticed they all seemed a little heavy so I'm sticking to my salad. It was really good. Tomatoe, Onion, Kalamato olive, greenleaf lettuce with a balsamic vinegarette I made. Lots of garlic. I had foul ass garlic breath the rest of the day.   The group was given news that our old manager was returning to us. This is very exciting as he is hardcore. I can't tolerate some of the incompetent fools I work with. They will be re-calibrated in no time.   I am finishing up a greenbean casserole thing right now. Should be yummy. My diet has been pretty good. A small portion of going away cake, and I should stop with the soda. Tell me you wouldn't have some kind of caffeine if you were up at 430am. I'm still thinking of what to cook for my stepdad on sunday.   Emily and Jeremy put their wedding on hold until december. Poor Poor Emily was about to kill her mom. It's sad that some people only worry about the perceptions of their peers instead of the happiness of their children. From what I saw and heard, the Mom's where more concerned with what their respective communities thought of the wedding, with no regard to the wishes of the children. If/When my day comes for marriage, my god have mercy on all who disagree.....  Greenbean cassarole is done...YAY!!!

       urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/southern_baptists   It pains me to think of my loving grandparents as members of this fanatic syndicate. I'm no fan of George Bush. Nor do I fall in line with all the stereotypical liberal ideals. I know a few people who are liberal vegans. They don't bat an eye on the abortion issue. Then you mention something about an omelette and listen to the whimper of "oh that poor lil chick". Who am I to say right from wrong?   I spoke with mom today about the sunday with the grandparents. I try to stick close to being a vegetarian. I choose to focus more on being healthly then being meat-free. I can have a mojito and key lime creme brulee with no meat involved. I somehow doubt that's good for me. What's with eating fish but still being a vegetarian. Most vegetarians I know eat fish. Crazy stuff. Well the menu for sunday is BBQ Chicken, jello salad, potatoe salad, and instant salad out of the bag from HEB. I am making something vegetarian for me and my step dad. The trick is since we have a two hour drive then church, it must be something that doesn't require refrigeration.   I'm off for an advil. I'd had a nasty headache all day. Then I'll work on lunch for tomorrow.  Cheers urlLink   urlLink   urlLink

      Aureas: of physical and mental excellences or attractions, golden, beautiful, splendid  In case anyone was wondering what my username means.   I've been listening to a band called The Notwist a lot lately. The CD is called Neon Golden. It    urlLink www.notwist.com   Here is an article which tells explains why being a vegetarian appeals to me.    urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040615/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/french_fries_vegetables_1   Something about french fries being a considered a fresh vegetable by the USDA. I admit I'm slipping on the veggie boy front. I just eat lots of pasta and cheese which is probably not good for me anyway. Plus my roomate gave up, and it's hard when he cooks some moroccan kabob's with sausage or something to resist.   This weekend will be busy. First there is 12 hours of work on Saturday. Followed by a party in Lakeway that night. I am going to church on sunday with my grandfather for fathers day. We shall be going to this church that's about a 2 hour drive from here, so I'm leaving at a wonderful 8am. I'm adjusted to working a day shift schedule again slowly. I like working nights much better. I was brought to days to bring "rigor and leadership" is what my manager said. I did get a little raise out of it, and I keep my night shift bonus for two months or so. I'm working on a master plan to get me back on nights, I'll keep you posted.  I'm spend a lot of time trying to figure myself out. The place I'm at right now is interesting. I spent a period of time weeding out friends who weren't right for me. Now I wonder what I should do about the friends who I'm not right for. By my nature, I'm not an extremely positive individual. For those who can't handle that, I see myself bringing them down. I have given much thought recently about relationships and what I want at this point in life. I don't want only those people who comfort me. I want to be challanged, but also to be allowed to be myself. I see a lot of hiding behing masks, being who you aren't just for the company. I don't seek love or a lover. I don't seek sex or affection. I seek only companionship, people to challenge me and help me grow.  I need to get showered and cleaned.  Cheers

      It's been a while since I've updated. I always get really bad about it. Things get busy, time flies by, then it's been a month and there's too much stuff to write. I always thought it'd be neat to be actively dating. Lately I've been on quite a few and sadly all were busts. Some were wanted "just friends",&nbsp;another was fine but thought I was too old, and the rest were just gross, dull or just not what I needed (no kids!!). My conclusion to this is that I think I made a discovery about myself. I'm a nymphomaniac. I've proven in the past to be perfectly capable of getting dirty 4 times a night, every night. So what I need is a fellow nympho who is willing to be monogamous.   I started working on the nights shift again for the next 3 weeks. It wasn't too bad. I'm learning to be more subtle and diplomatic, instead of yelling I whisper in someone's ear. May seen sneaky but it keeps everyone in check. It's fun giving someone a bright idea so they can say it was there own as long as it helps me in the end.   Lately I've chosen to take the path of naivete with life. The more I simplify the less drama there is. I like the narrow view as opposed to being upset with possibilities and consequences. I am still highly analytical with everythere, perhaps even to a greater extreme now. The difference is that I'm just amused instead of upset. It could be the subtlety's mentioned earlier. Oh well, i'll just keep it narrow. As Blake once said "just don't think about it".
