      I feel kind of guilty after my last posting. It's funny, you know, because I didn't write about anything that had not been on my mind for months. But I guess that, somehow, put feelings in writing equals to fully acknowledging them. There's no way to deny that you felt like this or thought about that if you have written about it; contrary to thoughts and ideas, the written word stays there, showing what you are.  I had the impulse of deleting the whole post, the whole blog. I thought that maybe I should write only about everyday things and keep my feelings to myself. But then thought that that was ridiculous. I mean, one can be pretty anonymous around here, if that's what one wants. And the chances of someone from my real world stumbling here and identifying me are nil. And for all I knew, maybe no one would ever read this blog. But I felt guilty about having written about the ex, and about my feelings for my husband, for anyone anywhere to read it. Maybe I felt as if I was betraying him.  I suppose this is the same feeling that has kept me from seeing a shrink. I have always been a very discreet person, who would only confide in a few friends of many many years. The idea of talking about my most inner secrets to someone unknown is still a shock for me. Now that I think about it, I even wonder how did I utlimately make the decision of starting this blog. I guess I was pretty sure that no one would read it!

      So, an ex-boyfriend called today. Not any ex, mind you, but  The Ex . I suppose I shouldn't make a fuss over it, and in some way, I don't. He just called to say hi (FYI, we broke up back in 1993, and after months of (me) being heartbroken, we managed to remain best friends. Then I got married, he got married and moved out of town, and we sort of lost contact). He's been married for 2 years. I've been married for almost 5. But to be perfectly honest, I asked him if he was very happy, and was kind of hoping that he would give me the great news that they had split or something. No such luck...  By now, one would be wondering what on earth do I think I'm doing. Well, to be honest, I'm not happily married. Not that I'm in a living hell or anything, but I'm just not happy, plain and simple (or rocky and complicated, it depends on your take!) I'm not unhappy enough to end my marriage  (sometimes I believe that later I'll regret my lack of decision, though) , but I'm sure that if I had a chance with someone else, I would give serious thought to that option. What a bitch.  Well, this guy was the love of my life, you see. I never ever loved anyone the way I loved him. On top of that, we had the most amazing chemistry I've ever seen. I'd never felt like that before, and I have not felt like that since.  Just for the record, I did love my husband when we got married. But too much has happened, so for now I only feel affection for him, that's all. No love, no sexual attraction. Actually, when you think about it, it's quite depressing...!  I guess I'll be writing more on this later. Who knows, maybe putting these things on "paper" will help me. My oh my, what a first posting!
