      Im hooome! So far today, jobs ok. Im taking a break...had an interview @ some law firm @ noon, but um...I started thinking (and listening to Barbies advice!) that the benefits there wont be as great as the ones I have now both insurance wise and vacation/sick time wise. So, Ive decided to only go to interviews that are for either city, state, or county jobs, esp. since right now I need a secure job and for the time being it doesnt get much more secure than what I have now. Anyhow...Im gonna go make me something to eat...mmmMMMmm ;) and Tony just told me Ale House tonight! WOOOOHOOOOOOOO! Im there like a bear!

      I  love LOOOOOOOVE  this song!!!!   "Show me how you do that trick  The one that makes me scream" she said  "The one that makes me laugh" she said  And threw her arms around my neck  "Show me how you do it  And I promise you I promise that  I'll run away with you  I'll run away with you"  Spinning on that dizzy edge  I kissed her face and kissed her head  And dreamed of all the different ways I had  To make her glow  "Why are you so far away?" she said  "Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you  That I'm in love with you"   You  Soft and only  You  Lost and lonely  You  Strange as angels  Dancing in the deepest oceans  Twisting in the water  You're just like a dream   Daylight licked me into shape  I must have been asleep for days  And moving lips to breathe her name  I opened up my eyes  And found myself alone alone  Alone above a raging sea  That stole the only girl I loved  And drowned her deep inside of me   You  Soft and only  You  Lost and lonely  You  Just like heaven  -The Cure

      I, now, totally understand WHY government jobs offer great benefits! Cause you will need to us them - totally! I swear, the dept I work for is ulcers, breakdowns, and heartattacks waiting to happen. I have never been in an enclosed area with so many ass', backstabbers, hypocrites, etc. etc.  Sadness... Its like Im torn between the best boss and a herd of assholes. Should I stay or should I gooo....lalala...are you gonna go my wayyy. :-p  The upside...still remains in that I share the office with a totally rockin' girl.  We're gonna pull kung-fu moves on everyone there...ok maybe not, but dreaming helps. hehe   Anyway, Im freaking out seems like this w/end its gonna be pouring in Tampa :( not cool...  Well, July 4th is right around the corner that day marks so many things/memories for me...my luck and lack of luck in love lol has always revolved around that day...kinda scary, we shall see what it brings this year. Anywho, its MY COUNTRIES DAY...WOOHOO!!! Im such a dork...I shall go now and do something productive.  Ahhh! wish me luck I have an interview tomorrow! yeah baby yyyeeeah!  No quote today - instead Ive got lyrics! :D  Me @ Miami Springs Senior High in 1993:   Dressed up to the eyes  It's a wonderful surprise  To see your shoes and your spirits rise  Throwing out your frown  And just smiling at the sound  And as sleek as a shriek  Spinning round and round  Always take a big bite  It's such a gorgeous sight  To see you eat in the middle of the night  You can never get enough  Enough of this stuff  It's friday  I'm in love  -The Cure!!!

      Fate brought them together...and so reality hits once again...and I am reminded...of a love far away that will never be. All that I know, it was a dream come true, even if only for a little while...and those memories shared will forever be in my heart. :sigh:  Now. I wonder where Meki is...so I can share these thoughts w/ her! The only other soul who understands these things is she!  Sometimes I feel as if "fate" were "fake" spelled incorrectly... remember?! :-p

      Boooo!!!! I just typed a shit load and all of the sudden my "session expired" WTF...bad way to start Mr. Blogger! Ehh...Now I shall just give you a rundown:  1. This is one of many blog/journal sites; Ive lost count...I hope I last on this one. 2. How I love my boss, and how he and one of my co-workers are the only people that make my days at work worthwhile...how sad that is... 3. Sunday, I get to see *thee* best dad; I shall go get him a lil something tomorrow. 4. How I totally love to spend time with my sisters, and how I wish they were just a hop, skip and a jump away from here (but I'll see them Sunday! :D ) 5. I took Phoenix to get his annual check-up and boosters and Jaime (the vet tech) told me "with him next to you no one can get near you" (my doggy was barking at him very meanly)- and then the vet telling me how I should get him neutered to calm him dowm a bit. 6. I dont want a wussy dog, so I will think about it. I realize he *is* stubborn and very dominant...then again so am I! heh! ;p  My fave new quote: "You can change events, but you cant change fate." - got it from last nights TRU CALLING episode!

      Sheesh! A full moon is most definitely around the corner...everyone seems to be having a severe case of Alzheimers and I think I will start to have one too...what-eh-ver!&nbsp; Situations are really making me cranky lately...and everyday I understand people less and less.&nbsp; Ok...if you&nbsp;have a secret and&nbsp;you dont want to tell someone, but you tell a couple other people, that would tell me that the couple of other people are the ones you can confide in. Am I correct? So WHY in the world would you then bring in&nbsp;a person who you felt you  couldnt  share the secret with and have them play a great part in what your secret was after the secret is out.&nbsp; Common sense tells me I would have one of the people I was able to confide in to play the part, since they were the ones already being supportive, no?&nbsp;I know this makes no sense to you guys who may be reading....sorryyyy. *sigh*&nbsp; Work was cool today...at least the people Im working with are becoming more amicable, and Im finally getting along with the lady that was giving me hell, she came to her senses that I DO NOT want HER position! Thank God! It was all just a matter of time, since most people&nbsp;loooove me. ;) Well, those that know me....and dont press my :::cough:::: red ::::cough:::: buttons. Yes, that line was for YOU, since you want to be as nosey as me (you know exactly who you are!)

On a diff note...I dyed my hair today (lighter)! Yea-yea! AND I gave myself a manicure and pedicure! Woohoo! ;p

      So today I saw this community blood donating bus from my window at the office and I got all inspired to donate blood, for the first time in my life.&nbsp; I build up my courage, and I ask Edison to go with me to keep me company in case I pass out (yes, dramatic, i know! but its my first time!) so anyway we go outside, I walk in the bus, and the girl is like "oh, sorry, this is our last donor (and points at a guy sitting there)!!!"&nbsp; Booooo, I got all excited and brave for nada.&nbsp; I will wait til they come back in 2 months. hehe. &nbsp;So much for that.

      I want me a Matthew McCoughnahey or a young Nicholas Cage! :p Seems like I will have to move out of Florida for one of those, cause all I think I will find here is an Antonio Banderas or the likes.&nbsp; I woke up having one of those days that I wish I lived anywhere but here, head to my L.A or anywhere north of Virginia. If I had enough money to get me out of here, I wouldnt think about it twice, isnt that sad? Oh well, I was thinking maybe I could start looking for a job in any of those places :shrug: and do it that way.&nbsp;I used&nbsp;be a little scared of living on my&nbsp;own, but I have realized that I can do it. I guess just having been around people all the time at home, made me doubtful, but Ive survived and realized Im a big girl!&nbsp; We'll see, I know in the end, hopefully....I will get out of here, I dont care if it takes me 15 years, but it will happen.

      yester day  was blagh...in the total sense of "blagh".&nbsp;&nbsp; However, yester night  was quite interesting...Miriam came by and picked me up and then we went and picked up Zully and headed to the Ale House.&nbsp; I called Tony to&nbsp;bug him on my way there, can't not to go the Kendall Ale&nbsp;House w/out him :p pero hes having&nbsp;fun in San Diego - lucky man,&nbsp;then&nbsp;I called Raf to harrass him and ask him what he was doing.&nbsp; At the same time&nbsp;Miriam was&nbsp;talking to Yenisei,&nbsp;who apparently got mad because I was&nbsp;also talking to Miriam...wtf,&nbsp;that chick is so fucking stupid (sorry Miriam!)&nbsp;shes done the same thing to me a million times, how does it feel bitch?!&nbsp;lol&nbsp;&nbsp;  So anyway, at the&nbsp;Ale House&nbsp;I ran into an old friend, Ariam, who invited us to sit at his table since they called his name before ours....that turned out quite funny, we thought it was only going to be&nbsp;5 of&nbsp;us&nbsp;and like I dunno 15 people showed up so we ended up moving by the pool tables from our little booth...his wife is so nice :) as well as a couple of other people.&nbsp; I told Ariam we have to hang out again!&nbsp; The last time I saw him was at the mini-Bon Jovi concert on South Beach, where i was totally surprised I didnt know he was a fan. ;) Anyway, one of Miriams online friends came to meet her and it turns out he knew some of these people! Heh, small world, huh.&nbsp; I managed to get Miriam to take a shot of Jager, I was impressed, she didnt take it like the Tequila one, too bad Sarah wasnt there.&nbsp; Im in my Jager phase again... Anywho, towards the end of the night, I was a little bothered by something she did, but whatever, after the whole thing with Brian I have realized its not worth getting upset over things, people do whatever they want.&nbsp; It just bothers me that sometimes people do things that are kinda hurtful and they are like whatever, wtf man, I think I have become too sensitive lately.&nbsp; I also realized that I need to start meeting more people with the same interests as I.&nbsp;&nbsp; :shrug:&nbsp;&nbsp; que sera, sera. Well...Im off to get ready, have to run a couple of errands and my WPBers are visting today.

      "Because we do not know when we will die,we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well, and yet everything happens only a certain number of times....How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood..that is so deeply a part of your being,you can't even conceive of your life without it?&nbsp; Perhaps four or five times more? Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty.

      On my drive&nbsp;home from work...as long as it was, since there was a thunderstorm and tons of traffic...I was especially paying attention to my thoughts, and lyrics from the songs playing..etc etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking of things we all do and we are blind to, you know actions and what not that we do to others that has an&nbsp;effect on them&nbsp;and we dont realize it until the other person points it out or until after the fact and you realize what you did.&nbsp; Or like some people, you never even find out what screwy things you may have done. &nbsp;So, anyway, "Cold" (Crossfade) came on the radio, I like that song!&nbsp; Ive noticed more guys are putting out "apologetic" songs, sort of like Hoobastanks "The Reason" (which is seriously played out).&nbsp;   Makes me wonder...we all screw up, but the way to learn is to realize where you screwed up.&nbsp; Some people dont realize the things they do to others, no matter how many times they do it and how many times they are told about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how are people supposed to get along,&nbsp;if&nbsp; they dont communicate and grow?&nbsp; Argh, thats one of my biggest pet peeves, when you have people who just feel their thoughts/way is the right way and dont care to listen to&nbsp;the input of others when it involves more than just them.&nbsp; Unless you want to be a hermit or remain single your entire life, you have to compromise with others, because you dont live in this world alone people! Anyway, Im rambling...I dunno...all I know is that men suck, maybe not all of them, but ALOT of them.&nbsp; Enough babbling about this and that...for tonight.

       I thought this was wonderful....compliments of my dad, the best in whole wide world.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Why Women Cry...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;A little boy asked his mother, "Why are you crying?"  &nbsp;"Because I'm a woman," she told him.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;"I don't understand," he said. &nbsp;His Mom just hugged him and said, "And you never will."&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does mother seem to cry for no reason?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All women cry for no reason," was all his dad could say.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why &nbsp;women cry.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;Finally he put in a call to God.  When God got on thephone, he asked, "God, why do women cry so easily?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;God said:&nbsp; "When I made the woman she had to be special.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet gentle enough to give comfort.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and &nbsp;all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I gave her strength to carry her husband through hisfaults and &nbsp;fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And finally, I gave her a tear to shed.. This is hers&nbsp;exclusively to use whenever it is needed."&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;"You see my son," said God, "the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides."

Im too old to put up with that kind of shit.&nbsp; Dont be threatening me that if I dont *behave* a certain way Im not gonna get to do certain things.&nbsp; So damn lame! And then to top it off I cant open my mouth cause the second that I do, I am either supposedly cutting them off, or bitching, or what not.&nbsp; GEEZUS&nbsp;GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK!&nbsp; Maybe if I had a dick between my legs, was 27 y.o and umemployed, I would get more attention.&nbsp; Some people just dont know a good thing when they have it.&nbsp; FUCK THAT!&nbsp; The pathetic and sad part is that I get all upset, while the other sneaky person is having a ball.&nbsp; Im a fucking great girl, I do my shit and when it all boils down to it, I do it alone, I dont need crap from anyone...and I ESPECIALLY dont need to put up with it. How some people can be so nice one minute and total jerks the next is beyond me!

      I  REALLY  need to start using my experience and learning, rather than giving people the benefit of the doubt constantly. This is something that I have decided to work on  RIGHT NOW ! Whats the sense in having people in your thoughts, when you arent in theirs?! Furthermore, I am sick of dealing with people who dont think or who lack any conscious. The End.

      My day began - one of my kittens was run over across from my house, I thought my neighbor would pick it up and he didnt (I was late for work, and couldnt do it) so I figured if he didnt I would when got back home, but um...it was run over several times by the time I got back from work and I practically wouldnt be able to pick it up now so sad...the poor momma (Molly III) was there, which is why I wanted to pick it up, so she wouldnt be constantly seeing it. Observing animals for sometime now, they really get affected when things happen to their babies, its weird, how some ppl think only humans get have these kinds of feelings. Anyway...so that was sad..and it was the kitten I was gonna give Idelmis too. :(    Then..today I had my interview...went alright. What sucked royally was that I didnt think about telling my supervisor cause since its all in the same dept. I thought hed find out...turns out he didnt and he got upset that we (my buddy and I) didnt tell him we had interviews. So he felt betrayed. Of course, I totally understand him, he has been great with us and now I feel like an ass. So, Barbie gave me an idea of getting him an "Im sorry" card and would you believe I had to go to 4 diff places to get one?! Hallmark, you are slacking!!! Do people not apologize to others anymore? Sheesh!!  Anyway, hopefully he will get over it. Hes a super cool guy and didnt like to see him all upset. Blagh!  Other than that, I have come to the conclusion that I dont learn. I should open my eyes and pick up on hints, actually I do, but I am too hopeful of a person.  So, this is the last time that I am going to do what I did tonight. I get the picture. Plus, weve grown way distant. :shrug:   Tony and the gang was going to Boomers today, I hope they are having fun!!! I didnt make it cos I came home from work and had to mow my lawn like a responsible person! I am way tired! :p

      You know, Im starting to  really  believe that nice people  DO  indeed finish  LAST  and lucky if that...perhaps we all just drop dead and never get our cake.    I really dont fuckin' get it. One of my ex's from a few years ago, who I went out with for like 3 years and who was at one point a great boyfriend (I give credit where credit is due) w/ the exception of his side of ghetto-ness and gangsta-ness (if you know me you know exactly who Im referring to)...anyhow back to what I was getting at...I found out that he is now happily married w/ kids and probably even a dog. :p WHATfuckinEVER! This guy turned TOTALLY psycho on me, when I broke it off with him, he was completely in love with me and of course I dumped him because after 3 years, I saw "no future" w/ him, I got tired of being the "man" in charge (notice, the cycle)...we gave him a place to live and eat, hooked him up with jobs, etc and asked for nothing in return. But, it seems the ppl we help out move forward and we stay in the same spot...so...now Im thinking screw that Im helping myself and everyone else can hustle it on their own.  Bleh!!   So anyway, I found out that things are working out for him now and Im happy for him. I mean, I kinda should be right? At least he didnt end up dead or in jail, right? Although, there were times I wished one or the other of the above after the atrocities he did to me after the break-up. But, WTF...here I am a cool chick w/ a good head over my shoulders, too nice for my own freakin good sometimes, and look at me, waiting for my turn; struggling every day to make ends meet, waiting for a "good" guy. Blagh!  Yeah, so what if I sound selfish or whatever...I dont really care.  Its not fair, I see it day in and day out, even amongst my friends. It seems you gotta either be a dick or you gotta do illegal shit to work your way up. I really hope all this being good in the end is worth it cause, slowly but surely I may just become a bigger bitch that I already can be.  Ahhhh!!! Ok, I have vented. Breathe in...breathe out....repeat....

      TAAA-DAAAA!  Ahhhh!!! I WILL become authority, I will carry a Glock, and I will hand cuff YOU! hehe! Im so psyched! I will have to go to Broward to train, but just for like 4.5 months or something...keep your fingers crossed!!! WOOT! WOOT! Im gonna be the shiyaaat!  Ladeedaa...last night was coolers, went to Mr. Moes with Tony, Raf and Cristina we hung there for a little while outside on the cool sliding table/chair thingies, then went in to listen to the band. Following that we went to the Drum Circle at the beach wooooooo! Was a nice night for the Drum Circle too, we got there a little too late tho, I dont remember exactly but it was like 2.30ish or something, we hung there for a while. Oddness when I got there I was kinda sleepy, but I quickly woke up, Im so weird.  I shoulda been wired when we were at Mr. Moes so that it could last all night and I ended up getting wired towards the end of the night.. bah :p  Anyway there was this group of ppl playing/singing The Joker, Knocking on Heavens Door, and such, me likes - me likes alot!!   Anyway, I got an email from Dan, my buddy in LA whos in Miami for a few days, they might have a bbq and if so, I am so there, I havent seen this boy in years! So, if you read this Dan, CALL ME, CALL ME and let me know if its happening, I would love to see you! Other than that I thikn Tony mentioned something about the Biltmore having some 4th of July thing going on. We shall see...  Im out...

      This is something that has annoyed me for a while...what exactly constitutes to "boring friends"?  Friends that exhibit some sort of maturity but can be silly at times?  I like balance.  I admire individuals who can be mature as well as act like a kid sometimes. Sadly, I have noticed that some people feel that because an individual exhibits maturity that they are boring, they dont care to realize the persons other side.  I wouldnt call a being like this boring I would call it someone who knows that in life there are circumstances which one should confront w/ maturity and also those that must be seen/acted out through the eyes of a child.  That is what I like about my friends.  I can have a serious heart-to-heart conversation w/ them or I can be a total retard and be super silly.   I think that "boring friends" are those friends that either show off and try to impress others by being/acting like total imbeciles or the ones that want to be so mature that they are serious all the time, these extremes to me would fit the definition of boring, because if there is no variation, there is where boredom lies. Hmm...yeah...I think thats it. Anyway, I guess it really boils down to the people you are attracted to...I wouldnt trade my friends in for people that are here today and gone tomorrow...because they  may  appear to be "exciting friends."   Wisedom does indeed come with age.

      Couple days update:  Weds - My place flooded :/ my water heater busted and you can imagine...I found out when water was everywhere...sadness  Thurs - Dad came early in the morning we got a new one, yahoo and I had water again! YAY! Dads are the bestest! Then I showered and went to work, I got there like at 1 or so...so much crap going on in that place, its ri-di-cu-lous! Anyway, then at night I wanted to go see Miguel, cause its been a looong time since I have seen him and it was his birthday! yay! So, went and had dinner w/ Bri at Moes and then went to the SandBar and met up w/ Miguel, David, Louis, Maria, Chris, and even Juan was there wow, I hadnt seen him in years well I think since I we worked together or somethin like that. Then just came home and went beddy bye.  Friday - Eh...lemme think...oh work was alright, I talked to my "Godmother" was her birthday! Im so psyched shes building this huge house like Santa Fe-ish style in Ft. Pierce she says all the neighbors are like WOW, probably gonna be finished by my birthday (its taken her like a year and a .5 to get it built!!), I cant wait to go up and see it! :-D  Then at night Tony and his buddy Edy picked me up, we went and picked Maria up and headed to the Ale House, Miriam and Zully were already there. On the way there I called Meki to congratulate her on her new digi-cam :-D and share my happiness about that certain someone that actually made tiny contact with me! lol  At the Ale House I ran into Mitzy and her fiancee JP, hes a cutie, also ran into Denise, Nori, Leo, and even this guy Fidel who I worked with eons ago! Lately everytime I go there I run into someone new. Anyway, good times, I was talking to all the people walking by out table, had Zully paranoid everytime the waiter came to our table! haha! Threw ice down Miriam and Zully's shirts (hey they shouldnt have worn low cut shirts lol) and then ended up under the table running away from Zully wanting to get me back! :/ The only cool boy who drank Jager was Edy, cause I ordered Miriam and Zully shots and the girls didnt want to take them! GRRR! Hmmph! lol Anyway, was lots of fun and I wore my new gay pride shirt! HAHA! ;) ANYWAY..next time I will have to make sure that guy Monkey is there so I can have someone to play pool with! yeeeeah! Im not sure whats in store for tonight Brian was telling me something about one of his new buds birthday at the beach, we'll see. For now...I shall go eat somethin' Im starving!

       urlLink "What mystical creature are you?"     Mermaids  These creatures are smart and playful. They love the water and have beautiful voices. Some have been known to catch the careless wanderer. They have been spotted by sailers for many years, great sea creatures that have the tops of humans and the tails of fish. They are beilived to be pure myth, but from every great myth there was a grain of truth.

      :sigh: all I ask for is a little bit of patience....when things seem to be looking up, its when they are falling apart...hence "Aint it funny how you never ever learn to fall, your really on your knees, when you think your standing tall" (BJ). I was telling Tony, I cant wait til Ale House...and I really cant....Im drinking more lately than ever :/ sadness...soon I will be going to AA meetings (ok, Im not THAT bad) :p But, WTF...its true what Sandy was telling me maybe I should go dyke like I always joke around with, at least I wouldnt have to deal with some of the crap that guys dish. Throughout all my years...Ive realized both from personal experience and by watching others that freaking relationships are a bitch, men are assholes (except my buddies reading this :p lol) I keep whining and complaining, I know I know. But its the honest truth. I was talking to my friend the other day and its like where the hell are all the "nice" men....they cant possibly all be taken and I have noticed that even freakin wild crazy assholic guys CAN turn into great guys when in a relationship, I have witnessed this...BUT those are guys that KNOW how to balance family, friends and an intimate relationship, as well as their career, so what the hell is the deal?! I guess some people just cant handle it, isnt that sad....Geez! ARGHHHHH!!!!   and yes...I know I am blind to  alot  of things...but one thing I am  not  blind to is that fact that "Iago" is to blame for some of the crap that gets thrown my way.

      Its raining, its raining!  Friday - Work was WOW, one of my coworkers was found in her office laying on the floor w/ blood all over the carpet :/ sadness, I called 911, my boss and some other people were there trying to help her...we dont know what happened...she was taken away by the rescue crew. I shall find out tommorrow what really happened. Then I came home, relaxed for a bit and waited for Brian to get here, with "Monsters Inc." we had dinner and then watched the movie, I was so pooped I fell asleep watching it. :/ Err! Then of course he took off and that was that.  Saturday - I woke up way later than I wanted to (1 pm) YIKES! I needed to be out of here by 3.30pm to meet Barb so we could go to Sandys bridal shower, so I was rushin, needed to wash my hair and all that good stuff. Then like at 2ish Brian shows up here w/ Sam :x to pick up Phoenix & Penny and take them to his house. The shower was cool, was nice to spend some time w/ Barb and Mimi  (Brians grandma) , Mimi was a TOTAL trip, I love your typical cuban grandmother. Sandy looked bootiful. :) They had a cute chef making Crepes OMG "to die for"...literally...that was the name of one of the Crepes I had (the dessert one) they were sooo yummy...mmm.mmm.mmmmm! I ate so much! Then, afterwards when we got back to Brians, they were just getting started on Adams birthday partay. I wasnt sure if I wanted to stay or not  (esp. w/ the presence of a certain person and how awkward I felt, but after a few drinks I was ok, they got me by ;) ),  but wtf, I was already there and was not about to pack up and get ready to drive back home with the doggies at 10.30pm. The party was cool, I met a couple of the people that I had heard about, Nori and Denise are cool girls, as well as a couple of boys (Hans, Leo, Chris, Johnny), I reserve my comments on some of the other people that were there. :p Anne-Marie was also there, was great to see her, I hadnt seen her in wow like a year or so, so we were doing some bonding at the beginning of the party esp. since we didnt feel very comfortable there surrounded with a bunch of new people. I think the highlight of the night was the stripper Denise got Adam...WOW...that poor girl had the boys hiding behind a tree. Kinda looked like something out of a bad porn lol. Needless to say everyone was talking about her, she totally was not stripper material. I felt so bad, she HAD to have noticed that when she got there the boys ran away! lol Adam was a great sport tho! :D Oh yeah! I almost forgot, I also tripped and hit my head on a door knob and now have a bruised nose and a nice gash on my eyebrow. :\ Sadness. I spent most of the night looking like a pirate with this Band-Aid across my eyebrow lol dorkness...I covered it up w/ a Budweiser label so ya know...not TOO bad! lol  Sunday - Woke up late again, hit Target for a few mins went back to Brians and had some lunch with him, Sr, and Sam and Dania. Then packed up and headed back home and now am doing laundry - yay! :
