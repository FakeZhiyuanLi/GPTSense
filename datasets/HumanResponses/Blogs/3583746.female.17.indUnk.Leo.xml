      hey ya'll! well, the sleep over at crystal's was much fun. we watched chicago, some of center stage and some of drop dead gorgeous and then just talked a lot. talked so much, in fact, that i only got about 45 minutes of sleep since we had to wake up at 6 to go down to the centre for load in. it wasn't too bad though. we got to leave before 10.  ah! courtney and i were supposed to go see the notebook yesterday, but i was half dead and slept through my alarm...ding it!! i gotta see that movie like asap!   thank god for no more skirts at practice. we take over the centre starting on monday, and i really hope i can get my own mirror this year. practices start going til 11:30...yay! or not. we'll have fun playing around and having the "theme days." (can't wait for "attitude T day!) but its gonna take a lot for me not to scream. or cry.   gotta go run some errands, then get ready for the freedom festival parade...later!

      i thought tonight's practice wouldn't be that bad because we just did musical numbers in the second act, but it was pretty rough. although the dance to "brotherhood of man" is SO fun and joe and i have a fabulous time shakin our tailfeathers, the song itself pretty much makes me wanna cry. we don't ever sing the right words, and never get the prases right and it takes like 20 minutes just to get through it. YUCK!...plus there is that other thing about it that makes me wanna throw something, but i'll just stop talking about it now.  tomorrow's the big sleep over, lol. woo! not too excited about waking up the next morning to be at the centre at 7am though. BUT i'm a drop girl w/ leann (my twin, lol) for the third year in a row so that makes me VERY happy. (ps-the drop girls are totally leann's favorite!)  courtney and i are going to see the notebook on friday!...yay!  when my pass came in you dropped the ball it didn't change the way i feel and i was wishing i'd break down your wall the kiss will know if lips stay still there is a line i crossed and when you missed i lost i'm not a loser don't you know that i'll be back again my dear, i went for the steal maybe it was rushed oh, my crush, i've got a crush i suppose that i could hold it in but you excite my every cell sources say that senses are your friends my senses say that i should tell you that i'm not ashamed you might just feel the same but i have to try it if you're ever really gonna know my dear, i went for the steal maybe it was rushed oh, my crush, i've gotta crush i want to i need to i have to have you you're so much to touch you're too much and i can't control it-you've got me all over the road my dear, i went for the steal  maybe it was rushed oh, my crush damaging my soul you blew me off, but i don't mind i just get better with time and so do you so do you my crush -gavin degraw "crush"

      you know what i hate? when you MIGHT be interested in a really nice guy who is nice to everyone. because then, when you talk to him, you can't tell if he's flirting or if he's just being nice to you because he's nice to everyone.  i saw ashley at the movie store tonight for the first time in a few weeks and that made me happy!  so uh, this whole wearing skirts and heels to practice every night thing is getting really old, really fast. i miss my t-shirts and sweat pants and being comfortable. BUT we starting rehearsing w/ the orchestra today, which meant all the girls got to stare at the hot drummer, and all the guys got to stare at his hot girlfriend, lol. AND DJ was there and he's just cool, so yeah.  well i'm gonna go watch "big fish". later!

      rehearsal tonight was hard on my feet. i do not enjoy the character heels. thank god i don't have to wear stilettos like em and ryan and betsy...no fun!  what was with the stupid girls talking to parker tonight and telling him that he looked like someone from north who, according to mackenzie 1. looks nothing like parker 2. is extremely ugly and 3. is a druggie??? those girls are so annoying. stephanie and i had a great conversation about how bad we wanted to hit all of them and tell them to put some clothes on and ease up on the make-up.  the show is in less than 3 weeks...ahh!  "everyone has a secret? but can they keep it? oh no they can't."         -maroon 5

      hope everyone had a good fathers day. our's was nice. just went to church and to visit papa joe (my dad's dad), ran a few errands and then had dinner here with pawpaw (my mom's dad). later tonight we helped nana take the rest of her things to her new apartment. its really nice and very cute. i was sad to see her go though. i got really comfortable with her living with us. i know that she needed her own place though and i'm glad that she finally got it. she seems to be doing a lot better. i just hope she does alright living alone.  after we went to nana's, we stopped by the humane society so that my dad could add some things to his new office and we got to play with the kittens!   so courtney, nichole gaines and i saw "dodgeball" last night and it was freaking hillarious! i highly recommend it! courntey and i have a whole list of movies to see this summer, which include: -the notebook -the village -a cinderella story -spider man 2 -anchorman ..and last but surely not least: i, robot. haha NO! jk.jk. but i definately do want to see all the movies listed above and i'm sure a few more as well.  ah! you know what i JUST remembered?? i'm going to a john mayer/maroon 5 concert on july 30th! hot damn!  welp, the weekend's over. back to rehearsal...ahh!

      10 inches off my hair. holy shit. when she made that first cut i thought i was gonna puke, but..i really like it a lot and it looks so healthy! AND i had enough cut off to give to locks of love and that's just awesome so yeah, i'm very happy.  ashley was in a wreck yesterday! she's a little banged up, but she's alright. that put an end to our stupid little fight.  i went shopping today. my purchases included: a very cute XOXO purse, steve maddan sunglasses, curve purfume, a few pairs of earrings, and a cute black skirt. i figured i might as well get one more skirt since thats all we can wear to practice in from now on, along with those damn chracter heels. can you say uncomfortable?  gotta go!  i'm going to see "dodgeball" tonight and i'm SO excited!

      so in honor of my beautiful new blog, i wore my "i   for some reason, i am excited about school starting again. i don't really know why. maybe its because my classes this year will be way more interesting AND...we're getting our new auditorium and doing "into the woods." yeah, that could definately be it.   well tomorrow is the day, ya'll. i'm getting my hair cut. nana offered to buy me a wig, but i said no. i'm going to go about this in a mature way. hair is hair. it will grow back. and i have a feeling that i will end up liking it a lot anyway. don't get me wrong though, if i were emily and i was told that i had to get my hair cut i would definately get a wig. i just hate the fact that people who have shorter hair than i do are bitching and being babies about it. bah! everyone's hair looks cute who has gotten it cut, so just calm down!  and i'm outta here!

      for some reason, i feel like there is something missing in my life. its hard to say what it is. i'm having a great time with the show, summer's going good, but it seems like i'm supposed to be doing something more. like i need to go out and do something out of the ordinary.    there was a drug bust down the street from us on wednesday night. yeah i know, "a drug bust in evergreen acres?" lol but there definately was. my mom told me that she saw flashing lights, and it looked like they were outside chelsey's house. so we took a little walk down that way and tried to listen to what was going on. all we heard was some police officer yelling at someone about "rolling up a blunt" and  they had drug dogs out sniffing all over the place. well, turns out that it was just a traffic stop that just happened to take place right in front of chelsey's house. so yeah, that was a bit of an adventure.  well, we blocked "paris original" last night at practice. i liked it a lot and had fun, but i have a feeling that when we go back to do it again today, it will all be changed. so quick question: are we really supposed to have the whole show blocked at the end of tonight's rehearsal? if so, its gonna be a long night.

      the bad news is...I HAVE TO CUT MY HAIR! yup, a whole handfull of us were told tonight that we all have to have our hair cut to our shoulders. at first i was really upset because i have been growing my hair out since like 6th or 7th grade. but now i'm kind of excited because i think that i'm really going to end up liking it. its just funny because this is the second time i have had to do something drastic to my hair for a show. first there was the daisy mae fiasco and now this. oh well. that's show biz, folks.  but the good news is, that i have a solo line. its only like 4 words, but hey-thats something, so i'm excited. betsy and i also get to have another face off, so thats cool.   all in all, tonight was not really an enjoyable practice. it was very long and drawn out, and i'm really sore from just standing around so much. ellen and i had a laugh together and that was fun. too bad we were the only ones who saw what was so funny...hehe. and tonight we also made plans for our dancer get together next week. we're all staying the night at crystal's on wednesday night and we're going to watch a ton of dancing movies (i.e. dirty dancing, flashdance, center stage and footloose), and then thursday morning we're going to burdette to lay out and swim...woo!  *HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY MOM!!*  ...and i'm spent.

      i got done with rehearsal at 7 tonight then molli and i went to lics with brandon, adam, and parker then went home. i got to watch summerland and queer eye for the straight guy, so i was really excited about that. molli and i also watched the first act of "into the woods" and i started getting really excited...not only about the show, but also about our new auditorium, complete with a dance room..yay!  okay, "how to suceed" people, do you realize that she show is less than a month away? wow. okay, so they're cutting betsy's hair? hmm..that makes me a little nervous. because my hair is so long, they said that they would probably have me wear a wig, but now that they're apparently cutting people's hair, does that mean mine will get cut too? i'm not sure how i'd feel about that.   i talked to nicole tonight for the first time in awhile and that made me really happy. we're doing something on thursday so yay! and courtney-"dodgeball" this weekend?! i think so!

      tonight i went and chilled at jessie's with her and her friends, ashley and kim. those girls are just so much fun! all four of us have so much in common and we just talk and laugh the entire time we're together. they're going to holiday world on tuesday but i obviously can't go because of the workshop and rehearsal, which sucks. but its cool because we'll hopefully get to go before summer's over.   but yeah, tonight the plan was for me to pick up a pizza from noble romans on 41 on the way out to jessie's. well i called it in and everything, and when i went to pick it up i found out that i called the wrong one and our pizza was definately NOT there. AND...clay hassler was there and so he probably thinks i'm a huge dumbass, which i am. so yeah.  you know, my 17th birthday isn't too far off and i have no idea what i'm gonna do this year. i kinda want to have a big party, but i also kinda just want to chill with a few friends, so i dunno. speaking of party...courtney: when are you parents going out of town??   i'm excited because tomorrow the techniques workshop starts. i'm not sure who all is going, but i'm sure it'll be fun. but i do have to wake up early tomorrow, so i should probably go. later ya'll!

      yeah just take a look at him. he's just so pretty! (ps i hope everyone can see my pics of orlando bloom on here, cuz otherwise you're just gonna think i'm crazy!)  so..schmidt awards were today...didn't get top 10, but i didn't expect to so it's all good. i did alright i guess, but it was my first year so maybe next year i'll do better. but yeah-congrats to everyone because you all did a wonderful job!  some of my family came in from out of town this weekend and i got to spend some time with them tonight, so that was fun.   i also finally watched "mystic river" and "monster." "mystic river" was very good and i really just liked her hair and her outfits in "monster" lol.   starting on monday i'm going to have this techniques musical theater workshop at the dance studio from 10-12 every morning for two weeks AND we're going to start having rehearsal until 10pm, so needless to say, i'm gonna be one pooped out little girl! oh well, its worth it. i'm ready to get down to the centre tho! ...that's where the fun really starts!  ...time for bed!...night!

      so pretty much everyone knows by now that central's musical next year is "into the woods." okay, can i just tell you how excited i am? we saw a part of it at the state thespian conference last year and i really liked it. plus, there are a lot of parts and we're definately gonna kick ass. i can't wait!  anyways, i got out of practice tonight a little after 7 and came home cause the schmidt awards are tomorrow. i'm pretty nervous. i mean, i think i'll do alright, but i'm not expecting to make top 10 and that doesn't really bother me. i've been practicing and so i'll just do the best i can.   well, i need to practice...peace!

      gotta love blogger and the fact that you can't leave anonymous comments.   i got out of practice at like 7:45, went home and changed, and then courtney and i went to los bravos and then went to see "raising helen" which was a really cute movie! i love courtney. we had a good time, catching up and talking. these two crazy, half-drunk guys followed us into the movie theater and sat down next to us and wouldn't leave us alone. it was really funny cuz one of them just kept talking and was like throwing nachos all over the place and the other one just like sat there. we think that they got kicked out though because they were THAT annoying, lol.  hopefully i will have a very nice new blog layout sometime soon...keep your fingers crossed!

      well, i just woke up because we didn't get home from the concert until almost 4:30 in the AM...yeah. the ride home sucked, but it was totally worth seeing that concert. it was A-mazing.  we got to The Verizon Wireless Music Center at about 5:15. it was just sprinkling a bit, but we didn't mind because 1. we had umbrellas and 2. our seats we in the pavillion, which meant we would not get rained on. so we walk up to the gate and it wasn't open yet. we were told that they would open at 5:30, so there we are, standing in line with our umbrellas while it was raining just a bit. but all of a sudden it started POURING. i mean, it was raining like crazy. so yeah, we got a little wet. but, ironically enough, just when the gates were open and we could get in, out of the rain, it pretty much stopped.  so we went in, bought our merchendise, (i got a Maroon 5 shirt and keychain), and found our seats. our AMAZING seats. they were SO great. so we got settled in there, and then went and got some food and just waited for the fun to begin. first came out DJ Logic. wow. all he did was play songs that everyone knows and add a few extra beats here and there. i was tired of him the second he walked out on stage. he played for what seemed like forever, but then, the fun began. Maroon 5 was so freaking awesome. they ran out on to the stage bouncing and dancing around to some crazy rap song, and then eased their way into "through with you." after that, they didn't stop. they just played song after song and every one was awesome. they only played for like 40 minutes, though which sucked, but oh well. i saw them. okay, john mayer is such an amazing performer. my favorite songs that he played were "come back to bed," "why georgia," and the first song that he played for his encore was...."COMFORTABLE!!!" at last year's concert we wanted him to play that SO bad, but he didn't. but when he came back out on stage he grabbed his acoustic guitar, said something like, "i'm playing for memories tonight," sat down in a chair and played the song. and at the part where he normally says, "but you could distinguish miles from Coltrane," he said "but you could distinguish miles from JACK JOHNSON."  the entire time he played the hell out of his guitar and he voice gave me chills like the entire time. but the real treat was at the end when James Valentine, from Maroon 5 came back out and played with him. they played this awesome awesome remix of "this love." then they had some kind of "jackass bullshit playing contest" in which James played standing up, then John played in between his legs. it was hillarious and awesome and amazing and i loved it.   well, i must stop talking about this now or i'm just gonna ramble on for days. if you want to know more, then just ask me because i'd be more than happy to tell you about it!

      atleast once every winter i get deathly sick. well, this winter i was lucky, and while everyone else was hacking and sneezing and blowing their noses non stop, i was perfectly healthy. well, i'm not so lucky now. i wouldn't say that i'm deathly sick, but i am sick. watery eyes, running nose, disgusting cough, man-ish voice. i've got it all. and the day before the john mayer/maroon 5 concert! damn. oh well. i know that seeing all my favorite boys will make me feel much better.   my mom went into her office today to get some stuff done before the school year starts, and she got my schedule for me. i've got communications/broadcasting, sociology/psychology, AP english, concert choir, etymology, 1 semester of algebra 1 (ha!), algebra 2, and psychics. AND my homeroom number is different, so i'm thinking that i don't have good ole' mrs. blemker anymore. that would truely be a shame.   well, i have a very busy evening of laying around and watching movies ahead of me, so i'm outta here.

      well, today/tonight was fun. i woke up at about 10 and went out to ashley's and i helped her take her 4H projects out to the fair. that was an experience, lol. she had a cake and a pie in my backseat, and me, being the idiot that i am, throw my purse into the backseat, and where does it land? right on top of her pie. yeah, she was freaking out and so was i, but the pie was fine and she got 2 first places so there ya go!  so after a fun day of 4H, we went out to lunch and to target with dee and chris neidhammer and that was fun. we saw jon hight in north park and yelled at him, and chris hit his mom in the head with the back door of their SUV, which was hillarious.   then we went to our own houses for awhile, took showers and headed out to the east side. our first stop was to best buy to visit ray, then we headed to kevin's house to pick him up for the st. ben's summer social. we hung out there and talked to him for awhile, then went and picked up logan, the crazy cross-dresser from teenpower camp. we went to the social for awhile, and didn't really do much but people watch and get stared at. so after a great time there, we left and went to mc donald's. then, one of the guys' friends ben showed up and we went crusin around in his mom's mini-van, which was awesome. we drove by showplace and saw our good buddy, ben from camp. we stopped at a really bad party, then went back to kevin's for awhile, then headed home. what a night!  i have already seen "the notebook." but since ray is so awesome, we are going to see it again tomorrow and i am SO excited!

      i have done some things in the past that have been very hypocritical, and that i regret very much. after spending five days at teenpower camp, i have made the decision that i am not going to make those mistakes anymore. its not worth it. i have awesome friends, an amazing family, and a wonderful life with a bright future ahead of me, and i'm not going to risk losing any of those things. i learned a lot about myself this week. i have a tendency to conform to the personalities of the different people or groups of people that i hang out with. i can't stand when other people do this, yet i'm right there with them, doing it all the time.   i think the reason why i had so much fun at camp was because i was more myself at teenpower camp, then i have ever been. i was pulled from my comfort zone and forced to spend time with people other than my really close friends, and i ended up meeting some pretty amazing people. ashley was there because she was on youth staff so i got to hang out with her a lot. that was awesome because we hadn't seen much of each other this summer. i was with brandon a lot too, spending time together, and throwing together our kick ass tap dance. i also hung out with elyse who i know and am friends with, but don't see much of, and mark from mater dei.   i met and became instant friends with emma provost. what a freaking awesome girl. we have a lot in common in that we're both changing and growing, but i also learned a lot from her and she cracked me up too. my roomie, lauren was awesome. we talked a lot and got along really well. the people in my family group were really cool, including scott (ashley's ex), lindsey mayer who i have met a few times through him, emily agnew, who's adorable and is also dating emma's brother, and yancey, a really cool who's a 28 year old college sophomore. he used to party and do drugs and stuff and ended up dropping out of college. but he's been clean for like a year and a half now and he shared some really great stories with us. and then there was ray perry. he is probably one of the coolest, greatest, sweetest guys i have ever met. i really hope that we get to spend more time together, and i'll leave it at that.  so yeah, my week was awesome, but very tiring and i'm now glad to be home.

      ok this guy totally broke my sister's heart, and for that, i kinda want to rip his head off. but oh no i won't because my friends, karma is a bitch and he will get what he deserves.   not only is molli having boy issues, i am too. this mystery guy that i have been talking about for awhile, now is completely unavailable. not because he has a girlfriend, but because i made him unavailable to me. i found out that his best friend is like completely in love with him and has been for like 7 years. and do i want to be the person to come between that? of course not. now, i'm not saying that i'm completely over him, because i'm still insanely attracted to him, but i will just make myself get over him. plus, if something was meant to happen, i'm thinking it would've happened by now, so yeah.  in other news, i have been talking to kyle a little bit lately. he's in idaho with his mom for the summer, and i really miss him. he had like a life changing experience today which sounded amazing so i'm really happy for him. he's changing and that makes me really happy.  well, the show opens tomorrow and i'm really excited. well, more excited about the cast parties than anything, but whatever. it'll be fun.

      i slept til 1 o'clock today and it was amazing.   well, i was really upset about ashley not being able to come to the show at all, but like 5 minutes after i woke up, the doorbell rang and guess who it was?! she made me a card and gave me some facial and foot treatment stuff for stress! it's awesome! wow. what a best friend! gosh, i miss her. and everyone else too!! you know who i really miss, who i have only seen once this summer, and that i really hope comes to the show? JAKE!...so if you're reading this, buddy, come on down to the centre sometime this week! and that goes for all the rest of you too. i hope to see all my friends there. except for ashley, as she as an excuse and gave me presents.   well holy crap, congrats to adryan on her new portugese boyfriend, hehe! thats SO COOL!  i got two clothing magazines in the mail today and i saw LOTS of things that i want for my birthday. (which, by the way, is coming up on august 7th). but the coolest thing i saw was a shirt that says: SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE!" yeah, i'm definately getting that.

      um, i was supposed to mail my stuff for teenpower camp yesterday, and well..i didn't. i guess i'll just run it by the place tomorrow and hope that they take it. ha.  so the show opens in 2 days. wow. practices have been going well though, so i'm thinkin everything's going to turn out great. ashley can't come at all though, so that sucks. but i'm having the sunday cast party, so that should be fun.   i'm really ready for this show to be over. i miss my friends i lot and i really wanna be able to do stuff with them again. last year it was okay because i saw jess like every day at drivers ed and ashley was in australia so it wasn't like i could see her anyway, and i wasn't as close w/ nicole and courtney as i am now, so yeah. i'm actually kind of ready for school to start, as crazy as that sounds. i have a good schedule, we're doing an awsome show, and we're getting the new auditorium.   ahh...well that's enough of that for now. i'm off to practice soon..later!

      because i have musical practice every day and i don't see some of my best friends too much during the summer, i thought i'd give a little shout out to five of my favorite girls.  ashley: ah! have we seriously only seen eachother just a few times this summer! that sucks so much. but we'll be together at teen power camp that that'll be fun. it'll be like the youth summit all over again, lol! i can't wait! well, i hope everything's going well with your new boy! keep me posted!  adryan: i'm glad we got to get together to go see the notebook...(even though you didn't cry because you have NO SOUL! haha) anyway-i'm glad you, leslie, and taylor had a good time in indy but i'm still really pissed that i couldn't go! but yeah, we've gotta hang out more this summer and we've also gotta keep burnin cd's for eachother!  jessie: omg i hate that i don't see you every day like i did last summer. i am SO glad that you introduced me to ashley and kim because they're awesome and the four of us get along really well. (prolly because we're all like the exact same person, lol). it sucks that i didn't get to go to holiday world with you guys, but we've all gotta hang out again soon!  courtney: it is so awesome that we have taken the time to go see some really awesome movies together this summer. "if you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a dodgeball!" lol. we also got to meet some really cool people too, lmao. well, i can't wait til you're parents go out of town...PARTAY!!  nicole: where the hell are you?! i miss you SO much! we had a blast going on a mad hunt for sweatpants and watching that documentary together, haha! i really hope that you come see the show, and tell greggy i said hey!!

      well it seems that my mystery guy and i are beginning to get a little closer. he's just SO hard to read and i can't stand it. HOPEFULLY something will come of this, but i'm gonna try not to get my hopes up.   practice wasn't as bad tonight as i thought it would be. we had an awsesome dinner..pasta grill. thats what everyone has been waiting for, hehe. and btw: how amazing is megan larue's mini refrigerator? yeah, that makes me so happy.  so we're getting this awesome deck built and i'm really excited cuz it'll be done in time for my 17th birthday party. speaking of that...i think i'm just gonna have a big cook-out, swimming, trampoline-ing partAY!   ashley stopped by today and i got to talk to her, which was fun. i miss you, girl!    You are most like Marilyn Monroe! Your inner child is alive and kicking. You might tend to be oversensitive, but people are drawn to you like white on rice. You enjoy a good party but need some time to be alone as well. While some may view your life as overly exciting, you are more inclined to be found curled up on the couch with a good book.    urlLink   Which Classic Diva are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      first day back wasn't all that bad. i'm in a new homeroom and i couldn't find it because they had the wrong teacher written on there, so i was definately late. after that the day went pretty smoothly. i'm really excited about my press pass and my driving pass for broadcasting. our choir isn't sounding too hot. i know it was just the first day and everything, so maybe we'll get better. but i doubt that. i'm an alto. wonder how many times i'll move around this year.  after school today Molli and i went to visit Pawpaw at the hospital. he's breathing on his own so that's really good. he's gonna be fine.  i am REALLY tired. goodnight!

      well its all over, folks. no more summer. i had a pretty good last day, though. Ashley and i took Molli to school to get her books and put fun stuff in our lockers. too bad Ash's locker is in the hall with no camera. she's gonna get beat up. but yeah, we also went back to the mall today and i got a lot more great things and i'm excited.   anyway-i have a feeling that this school year is gonna be pretty tough, but i think opening my locker to see  Adam Brody, Adam Levine, and Chad Michael Murray and a few pictures of me and some friends every day will make me feel better.   i hate to say it, but Red Heat is in the shop, getting her brakes replaced. i'll be rollin' up to school in Pawpaw's Trailblazer though, so its all good.  well damnit all to hell, i'll see most of you tomorrow.

      i went shopping tonight and got lots of fun things! i'm excited to wear them and show them off. i'm also getting a lot better at the whole "smart shopping" thing. mom's pretty excited about that. i got 4 pairs of shoes tonight, which i am VERY excited about. but, is it bad that i have my outfit planned out for the first football game?   well guys, we have one more day of summer vacation left. can you believe it? this summer went by way too fast. i had some really sucky times but also some freaking awesome times as well. like last night. Megan, Mackenzie and i went to the Olive Garden and then went to see Napoleon Dynanite. omg i loved it! one of my favorite parts was when Napoleon told Deb that she needed to come get her stuff out of his locker cuz it was taking up a lot of space and he couldn't fit his numchucks in there anymore. LOL. wow.   i have to take molli to get her books tomorrow, and then we are going to the mall (again) with ashley to shop some more. YAY!  kyle called me tonight and that made me happy. he has changed so much in just one summer and i am so proud of him. he's a good kid.   ...and, i'm out!

      i had a wonderful birthday. nothing too extravagant or special happened, but i had a great day. i went out to lunch and shopping with my family (mom, dad, molli, nana, and pawpaw) and then came home and hung out for awhile and then went out to dinner and to burdette with ashley. the thing for VOICE was a bomb, but we had fun listening to music and going down the slide once. i guess. then we went and got some bread sticks at pizza hut and went to ashley's and watched a movie. it was just a good, fun night.   my grandpa (pawpaw, as most of you know him) is having open heart surgery on wednesday. please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.   tonight i'm going out to eat and to see Napoleon Dynamite tonight with Kenzie, Megan (who just got back from the Bahamas!!), Abby, and hopefully Lynn and Ellen too. my sister saw the movie last night and said it was hillarious, as has everyone else who has seen it so i'm really excited.   well, i'm gonna take a nap.

      i made my big screen debut this evening.   well, not really. but i was in a movie that jessie osborne is making for project XL. we filmed it at one of will's houses and got to dress up and look pretty and act crazy and it was fun.   the people at the mc donalds on highway 41 are rude. brandon, mackenzie and i went there after we got done filming. their sign said that the dining room was open until 11:00 pm and it was only like 10:15 or so, so we knocked on the door and they just starred at us. stupid bitches!  and on that note, i'm outta here. i gotta wake up early tomorrow and babysit..ugh!  awesome quote from big brother tonight: "jase is about as erotic as a wet t-shirt contest in a nursing home." -will

      you know, i don't really mind staying home every once in awhile. sure i get bored at times, but i've been watching movies out the wazoo lately so that has been keeping me occupied. tonight i rented Wet Hot American Summer and Shakespeare in Love. and earlier today i started watching The Pianist and i plan on finishing that later tonight.   i have to be at school tomorrow morning at 9:00 to help decorate for the freshman orientation. i'm not too excited about the whole waking up early thing, but i'm SO excited about getting to see our new auditorium. my dad went and saw it last week and he said its amazing. also, parker and i (and whoever else wants to go) are going to pizza hut and that makes me happy.   so i have been thinking about what i want to do for my birthday. i know that nicole is taking me out on wednesday, but i wanted to do something with all the girls like go to the drive in or take a trip to holiday world or something, but i dunno. if you have any suggestions, let me know.   is it weird that i am excited for school to start? i think i'm just ready to get back in the swing of things. i do much better when i'm on some sort of routine. its gonna be so weird having my sister at central this year. i can't believe she's already a freshman. it seems like just yesterday we were both back at thompkins staring in The Aliens are Coming! The Aliens are Coming! and Lil' Abner together. ah, the memories.   well, ray already left for IU and its just a matter of time before a few other friends pack up and head off for college. that seems so far away for me. like i have forever to think about it and prepare for it. but i know i don't. most people worry about actually getting into college and taking the classes they want and what their roommate will be like. and while all of these things concern me, the thing that worries me the most is leaving my family. i depend so much on my parents and my grandparents and even my sister and best friends that i'm not sure what i'm gonna do when i can't see them every day. well damn, i better stop now.
