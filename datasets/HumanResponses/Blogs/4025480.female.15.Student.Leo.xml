Angela~ ur my girl! Baby Thugz 4 life, lol my mom is a dork i kno. but anywayz i owe u alot, im not sure but its ur advice and thoughts that keep me from makin bad decisions or the wrong ones its funny, all the times i have asked u advice, its turned out good. i dont know what id do with out you love you. chris* frenchy! ur the greatest, when im around u guys i feel like i can do whatever i want , like actually be myself and not care what anyone thinks, i feel like im on top of the world. i dont kno what i would do wit out u ur so sweet too. and yea i still think i can kick ur ass. lol love you   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** you two are the greatest thing that has happened to me. ur the greatest friends i have*    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hugs n kisses   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; katie
