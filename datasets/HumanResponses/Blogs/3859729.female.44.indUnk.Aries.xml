      I have a friend Jane, who is single and lives alone. She has multiple health problems. Sometimes Jane struggles with insecurity and depression. Thoughts of suicide cross her mind. One time when she was feeling this way, she prayed for help but none came. The urge to commit suicide passed but afterwards, she wondered why God hadn't sent help. Then one day after talking to Suzanne, a friend from church, she found that Suzanne had received a prompting the day she had prayed for help. She had felt that she should call Jane but sadly hadn't followed through on it.   Connie    (This is a true story but I've changed the names.)     Another Story....  There was a man trapped in his house during a great flood. The water was to his knees and rising fast. A neighbor came by in a raft and asked if he needed help. The man said, "no I've prayed and I have faith that God will save me." So the neighbor shook his head and left. The water was pouring in so hard and fast that the man barely made it to the roof in time. About 10 minutes later, a boat came by and the rescuers urged the man to hurry and jump in. The man replied, "no it's okay, God will help me." They were quite shocked but obeyed the mans wishes. Later a helicopter circled around looking for survivors. The pilot saw the man floating on some debris. His co-pilot dropped a latter to the man and climbed down to help him. The man waved his arms and yelled "go away, God will help me." The rescuer argued and pleaded but finally gave up. The man ended up drowning. When he reached heaven he was able to speak with God and he asked him why he hadn't saved him. God replied, "What do you mean? I sent you help three times but you refused it."   I heard this story from a friend. Though it's a fictional story, it's still a good example of the many and mysterious ways that our Heavenly Father helps us through other people.  I believe we can be our Heavenly Fathers hands. If we try to live a good life and keep our spiritual ears open we can be his angels here on earth.      Connie

      Remember Who You Are  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan Iroz, &nbsp;12, July, 04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When tears betray  Happiness intense  As diminished laughter  That will not subside…  Joyousness unabashed,  Simple and pure  In heart and mind,  Not affected  Nor embellished,  An open invitation  Readily accepted  In the best of times,  And in the worst.  You may know God  Speaks to your soul  And hears your smallest  Whisper.  &nbsp;  When tears stream down  A face contrite,  Delivering salve  To real ache  And painful regret,  Freely, &nbsp;  Without condemnation,  In gentle persuasion  To planes not reached yet  Or perhaps forgotten,  You may know God  Loves you as His child,  Remembers holding you  As He does now,  And kindly reminds  You to remember  Who you are.  &nbsp;  You may know Him.

      Good side, one less person to clean up after. Bad side, one less person to help you clean up.   Good side, no one to keep you up all night. Bad side, no one to keep you up all night.   Good side, you can date a different guy every weekend. Bad side, too many "different" guys out there.    Connie Ball 2003

      Warm embraces, soft kisses, sweet words, tender touch.   Never more.   Smiles, laughter, tickling, teasing, sharing. Doesn’t mean much.   Anymore.   Harsh words, slammed doors, hurt pride, mistrust.   Whatever for?   Life punches, it hurts, but we learn so  much.   Bring me more.    Connie Ball 2004

      Without taking risks, stretching ourselves, learning, growing, we are not really living.  I was painfully shy most of my life and hated it. I dreamed of being more outgoing, more fun. I told this old woman once about how shy I was. She asked, jokingly, "oh, you're too backward to go forward huh?" That really hit home. I decided my social phobia  had  held me back from really experiencing life. It  was  keeping me from going forward. I was too often sitting on the side lines and not accomplishing those things I really wanted to do. I made it my quest to change from then on.  Although sometimes it was very scary, I forced myself to do things that were out of my comfort zone. For example, I used to dread or avoid anything that involved dealing with strangers or having to do any kind of public speaking. When I would see someone in the store that I knew, I'd quickly go down another isle rather than have to talk with them. That's where I decided to start the process; the grocery store. I decided to approach people I knew and start a conversation with them. I was so nervous at first. I didn't know what to say. Even saying, "hi, how are you?" was painful. Afterwards on the way home, I'd go over the conversation in my head several times, thinking how stupid I must have sounded. However, I knew that learning anything took practice. I compared it to learning the violin. At first I might sound terrible, make several mistakes, but with time I would improve. So, I kept at it. Eventually it became more natural. I went on to teach classes at the local schools, taught in Relief Society at church, sang a duet with someone in front of lot's of people, and many more things. It felt great. The best part, was that I was becoming more confident and learning to love myself.  I think back to when I was a teenager. I worked as a cashier. Emotionally it wore me out, having to deal with people all night. Now I'm a housekeeper in Intensive Care and I look forward to talking with the patients. I especially like making them smile. The funny thing is, when they smile, often I'm the one who is cheered up. I never would have known this wonderful feeling, if I had not overcome my social anxiety, stretched myself, stepped out of my comfort zone.  I hope you will step out of your comfort zone, your cocoon, and give your dreams wings whatever they may be!   Connie Ball 2004

      I am an arrow honed with live's bitter circumstances, with knowledge gained through trial and error,  Aiming for a target pure, just to be like him, to love unselfishly, to follow him through it all, to get up again if I should fall and see in the mirror  Someone looking back at me that I can be proud of, not just for me but also for him above  This arrow veered off course a while, into forests dark with shadows hiding truth and light  And rocks fell from places not seen, and stole some of the arrows gleam  It was he who made the arrow and though I was not made to fail, I have a choice to lose or win  I can only hit my mark if I aim, trying not to fall again   Connie Ball 2003

      Ultimately my prison became my cocoon, a place where I grew to be stronger, to have more faith, to believe in myself, until one day I broke free and took flight. Sometimes I'm frightened and I miss the safety of my cocoon but for the first time in my life I feel like I'm in charge of my own destiny and it feels great.   Connie Ball 2002

      Don't dwell on dreams and forget to live your life.   From the movie Harry Potter   Sometimes you have to go crazy or you just might lose your mind.   From a song I heard on the radio   Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.   D&C 112:10
