      Ok, this is very cool. AISO GrepLaw, Detritus as set up a “Sonny Bono is Dead” site, collecting samples from the works that would have passed into the public domain, but for the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.  Sonny Bono, I am told, was a sweet man and great friend. I’m sure that’s true, and his untimely death certainly robbed the world of the very best of this man. It’s therefore very sad that the worst of Sonny Bono continues to echo — this indiscriminate extension of copyrights. Congresswoman Mary Bono had some great ideas about how to make Congresswoman Lofgren’s Public Domain Enhancement Act “better,” as she put it. Is there a possible Sonny Bono Public Domain Act in the works?
