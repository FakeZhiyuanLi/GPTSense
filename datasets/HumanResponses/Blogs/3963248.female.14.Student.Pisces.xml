       I decided on something crimson for a new layout, because I like a blood-red journal, 'k?      I missed the Bake Off Night because I didn't have anything to bring. It's sorta my fault. *messed up everything* >_  Well, I guess I can chat up with people on Sunday.    About public school...parents say "Keep myself occupied. Fill up with so many classes and activities that I'll be too busy to get into trouble." It's for the best, but I want a study hall to knock off a bit of homework. I hate doing homework at home, despite how weird it sounds, I really do...a house of seven people and three frisky cats is NO PLACE to do homework. Really.    But I think I know my back-to-school style...    Assorted black baby tees (warm/hot weather)  Black-collared shirts (cool/cold weather)  Long skirts (whenever)  And if at all possible...normal blue jeans (whenever).    That's my idea for a wardrobe. Appropriate, able-to-learn-in, comfortable without looking like a homeless bum...yeah, it's all good.    Now...    A List of Good Friends  Ashley - tall, but really cool  Tricia - understands me well  Dean - understands me perfectly  Jon - cool guy, barely notices me, as in, I have to yell to get his attention  Dan - FREAKS ME OUT!!!  Katie - she's nice, but I barely know her...I wish I did    And I need to get to know everyone else better.    The thing I'm looking forward to at public school is my old friend Dorothy. She's nicer than ever, and she's still in touch with Natalie! *is bursting with overjoy*

       Since my  urlLink friend  has a Blog, I decided using this besides my  urlLink LJ ...not that I'll stop using my LJ, I mean, I got Cure communities to talk in there.    Today was a good sermon. It was a bit strong, you know, on the matters of sexual purity and immorality. But it was really good.    My sister thinks Dean is a weird guy who laughs at everything. He is weird, but in a good way. I mean, I can talk too much and he won't stop me. Hehe...maybe I do talk too much. XD    I just started downloading a bunch of new songs from church, like "Draw Me Close" and "Refiner's Fire."    Now for more Web-surfing!

        Hello again.  I made my Livejournal blue. There is an annoying rant about it there.  I went to the mall and to Target today. I saw a t-shirt at Hot Topic...it was The Cure. *heehee* I also saw their latest album at Target. I bought makeup at Target...and my sisters got Unreal Tournament 2004. *They own your sorry behind.*
