      Socks  Okay so I'm down to my last two holiday gifts that I need to purchase for my "sweet baboo" {for those of you unsure of the term baboo or unfamiliar with the Peanuts characters you can cease going to dictionary.com, it's just my boyfriend. The term baboo should not be confused with baboon, no worries I am not dating a monkey, though he does act a little ape-ish at times}. Anyhoo, back to the gifts so I have left to buy a book (easy) and some socks. Now, I know you are thinking socks are EASY! I should have no problem finding socks. Oh! How I wish that were true, unfortunately these are not just any socks....Oh no I have a sock standard to up hold. This is my own doing, you see last year as a "stocking stuffer" I purchased some TJ Maxx socks and chucked them in the stocking! I never expected him to fall in love with the socks, I only hoped they'd just be friends. No such luck my baboo loves these socks, I even think I hear him sneak downstairs in the middle of the night to wash them just so he can wear them the next day. So of course this year when asked the dreaded question, "Honey, what do you want for Christmas?" The world's hardest to shop for boyfriend indicated more of the "special socks". My dilemma, where was I to find these TJ Maxx specials? I thought for once the shopping force would be with me and I'd be able to find them once again at the Maxx! No such luck. I searched every "irregular" store in the area no special socks. Where was I to find these socks...What makes them so special. I drew up a missing poster and took pictures of the socks and posted them on milk cartons, finally someone answered my plea. My baboo's special, beloved socks were in fact....HIKING SOCKS! And could be found at any sporting goods outfitters. Ah ha I said as I froogled the term "hiking socks," my list would be complete after all! However, this sock story does not have a happy ending. Because the evil villain of over-priced sporting goods thwarted my plan. My baboo's beloved socks were in fact $20 A PAIR!!! Ten dollars per sock I could not believe it!!! The TJ Maxx ones were only $2.50! What was a girl on a budget to do!!!  I thought perhaps I could buy just one sock for Christmas and then go back and purchase the other one for my boyfriend's birthday. However, the sales clerk was none too thrilled with my idea. Then he pulled me over and showed me the reject hiking socks and suggested I purchase them, with their itchy insides and ugly patterns....I glanced over to the fuzzy, warm hiking socks and looked at them with longing desire....I had to have the special socks....They were my baboo's Christmas wish!!!

      For the first time in my life I've acquired female friends who I can be my normal self around. This is quite an amazing thing as I'm really not normal and there are times I don't think I can even be my normal around myself. You get 2 cookies if you can decipher that sentence. Well anyways my friend group has grown bigger than Martha Stewart's booty and I now find myself with the daunting situation of my social calendar being filled with more things to do than my work calendar. Though I have to admit I'd much rather enjoy and evening of drinking with the girls than an afternoon of arguing with LTCs. Hmmm maybe if I took the LTC's to a pub with the girls I could just streamline the whole process.  But more than just friends these new comrades add a whole new array of characters to my book of life. Now I finally need to start sketching out these grand characters....

      For those of you who were biting your nails and desperately waiting to know if my sweet baboo did indeed receive his Christmas socks, you will be happy to know he did. He loved them bunches and I swear I thought I saw him curl up to them under the covers one night. I'm afraid he loves them so much he might buy a pair of sandals and start wearing the socks with them just to bond with them during the summer. At that point I'll encourage him to sell the house and buy a condo in Florida, and while he's at it he might want to invest in a velour track suit.
