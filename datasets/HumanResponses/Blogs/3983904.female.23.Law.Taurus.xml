      Whoo!&nbsp; Yeah!&nbsp; I'm so happy that it's almost the weekend I could just burst.&nbsp; This week has SUCKED big butt, and that's an understatement.&nbsp; So, just got into work...doing the usual routine, drinking my Starbucks and checking my email.&nbsp; It usually takes me about 1 hour to actually get myself motivated to work.&nbsp; I'm super tired today, no idea why but I had to go for the grande today at Starbucks instead of the tall.&nbsp; Hey, at least I'm not "venti-tired" right?&nbsp;   So, for those of you who are asking about why I'm so excited about this weekend - well, Alaina has a date this weekend :-)&nbsp; And he might read this so I can't really tell you what I'm planning on doing, but it is a surprise - but I'm excited to say the least.&nbsp; So, that's what I have going on Saturday.&nbsp; Tonight...god knows...maybe I'll help Erika move some more - she has her hands full, that's for sure!&nbsp; I need a good weekend with how much this week has sucked.&nbsp; That, and I have a big MRI on Monday...which I'm not looking forward to, so I want to have fun before I do that.&nbsp; For those of you who haven't had an MRI ever, it's like being in a coffin with someone pounded a jack hammer up where your head is.&nbsp; It is a good time to be had by all :-)&nbsp; well, I'll write more later, I'm sure b/c it's Friday, which means the motivation level is down today.&nbsp; But until then, I must work!&nbsp; Laters!

      augh, one more hour left of work!&nbsp; I seriously have gotten NOTHING done today - well...no, scratch that...I made a hair appointment and I DID turn something into the judge.&nbsp; Gotta say, I'm a little nervous about giving him my work as of lately...who knows how he'll react?&nbsp; He's bipolar, I swear he must be.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm really really wishing today was Friday and I could have my fun day tomorrow.&nbsp; It's going to be great - I don't think I've been this happy or smiled this much in a long time, and I'm loving every second of it!&nbsp; I must share my happiness with the world!!! :-) ha ha...OK, back to work I go!

      That's my goal today!&nbsp; Today MUST be a better day, so help me!&nbsp; So, last night was not too bad...I got out of court late here....long winded lawyers kept us in court until 5:00, but I made it just fine to my nephew's karate test.&nbsp; He's a purple belt now!&nbsp; My nephew seriously is the coolest kid ever, and his Aunt Nain is so proud of him.&nbsp; Of course, I had to come home eventually..my family is crazy.&nbsp; Well, my parents, I mean.&nbsp; I got an earful about how long I was on the cell phone last night...blah blah....Just keep telling myself 3 weeks, and I'll be back in Dayton in my OWN apartment and free from people who try to control and tell me what to do.&nbsp; I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to be controlled at all, so this summer has been challenging to that extent, to say the least.&nbsp; Anyway, not much going on here today.&nbsp; My boss is gone on vacation until the end of next week (Yay!) so the mood in the office is so much happier today.&nbsp; Hell, at least I won't get yelled at, right?&nbsp; and then later tonight I'm going to go help Erika get her stuff packed to move into her newer, bigger apartment.&nbsp; I'm a moving pro by now, so I could probably do the whole job myself.&nbsp; That's what you get for moving every year or less.&nbsp; I'm just SO ready for the weekend.&nbsp; Got some big plans I'm excited about - I get to spend Saturday with one of the nicest people I've ever met, so I just wish today were Friday so I can go ahead and do that :-)&nbsp; But until then, it's a-divorcing I must go!&nbsp; Later gators!

      Yeah, so his bad mood?&nbsp; I got the wrath of it for about an hour there today - I suck as a future lawyer, basically.&nbsp; Suck suck suck.&nbsp; I shouldn't be in this profession and I have no backbone...blah blah...so, yes, today is just GREAT guys.&nbsp; I'm totally loving this week.&nbsp; OH, I can hardly stand my happiness about how this week is going.&nbsp; I might just do a little dance right here at my desk.&nbsp; (And YES, I'm being very sarcastic)&nbsp; Anyone want to go to happy hour?

      Well, the week is half over...god, I'm sad - it's like 8:40...I've been here for 40 minutes, and have I done anything productive?&nbsp; Nope, no way, no how...I AM Office Space.&nbsp; All I need is my meeting with "the Bobs" and I'm set.&nbsp; But I'm trying to lay low again today - the Judge is in one of his really bad moods.&nbsp; I swear, that man is more moody than I am, and THAT'S a hard thing to do!&nbsp; So my Jame is leaving today :-(&nbsp; Going to Greece to work for the Olympics.&nbsp; I'm going to miss her terribly, but that is so aweome what she's doing.&nbsp; So good luck Jame!!!&nbsp; I'm so sad with all of my friends going away.&nbsp; I guess that's what is hard about growing up, eh?&nbsp; People start having lives and moving away and things change.&nbsp; I guess I've done that too, but sometimes it seems that I haven't since I still am in school technically.&nbsp; Only 2 more years and I'll be a lawyer - if I pass the bar!&nbsp; And when I do, you are ALL invited to go to Vegas with me and celebrate.&nbsp; Maybe we can stay at my man Wayne's house.&nbsp; Hee :-)&nbsp; Well, it's almost 9:00.&nbsp; I have now wasted 1 hour of my morning...ah, must get to work!&nbsp;

      Ah, can you have a case of the Mondays on Tuesday?&nbsp; I think so!&nbsp; B/c I sure as hell do!&nbsp; Got up this morning at 5:00 a.m.....b/c I'm insane and went to work out, and well, now I'm sucking down the caffeine like nobody's business trying like hell to wake up.&nbsp; Must not mess up today...yesterday was an awful day at work.&nbsp; So I messed up big time on an order...really bad bad and stupid error, and the funny thing is that I did it a month ago so I don't know how I did it, and back then I was still learning what I was doing here.&nbsp; So, I got ripped a new one by the judge...by in a nice way.&nbsp; It's almost worse that way - being reprimanded politely...it's like the boss from Office Space.&nbsp; "Yeah, um...we're using the new cover sheets on our TPS reports from now on, mk?"&nbsp; So, hopefully I can stay out of trouble today.&nbsp; But like my nephew so wisely said to me yesterday "mistakes happen."&nbsp; 7 year olds can be so wise sometimes!&nbsp; Going to watch a bunch of junior high girls attempt to learn how to cheer later with Andrea - for those of you who don't know, she coaches 8th grade cheerleading at her school so I'm keeping her company...my life is JUST that boring, yes it's true!&nbsp;

      So, I just got into work this morning....am still trying to motivate myself to do some work, but we'll see how that goes...only 3 more weeks of writing divorces, so I'm happy about that.&nbsp; I'm ready for a change.&nbsp; the good news is my lawyer from the car accident is going to hire me for the fall!&nbsp; AND he's going to pay me!&nbsp; Whoo!&nbsp; Not sure just how much yet, but anything is better than nothing!&nbsp; I'm excited to work somewhere new and maybe see if this is what I want to do or if working in a small firm is for me.&nbsp; Anyway, I had a GREAT great great weekend.&nbsp; Everyone in the office is in a bad mood today, but I'm not!!!&nbsp; Nope, no case of the Mondays for me today!&nbsp;   So, it's to work I go - just wanted to say HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to my favorite brother and sister-in-law - 7 years of marital bliss :-P&nbsp; Love you guys!

      So, this is my first posting - I read my sis-in-law's diary thingy and thought it was pretty cool, and since I want to be cool just like her I thought I'd try.&nbsp; I sit in an office all day - I have THAT much time on my hands, what can I say?&nbsp; So, today, just an ordinary day - if you call listening to a 5 hour divorce taped proceeding and reading through a boring prenuptial agreement an ordinary day.&nbsp; Is it time to go home yet????

      SO, I'm still in Noblesville, but my stuff is now almost 100% moved into the new apartment.  My parents and I went to Dayton to bring my dresser, desk, and a futon, and my dad pretty much set everything up.  I have to say, it's actually looking like an apartment now.  There is now somewhere people can SIT, isn't that amazing?  I move in for good on Tuesday, which I'm both sad and excited about - talk about your mixed emotions!  I am having a house warming party for two with one of my favorite people, and then comes the unpacking and the dreaded homework.  Yes, I actually have two assignments already, can you believe it?  I think we all know when I'll get around to that, though....Sunday evening ;-)  Actually, no, I'm hell-bound and determined to get this semester off to a good start.  Slacker Alaina isn't allowed to come out and play at least until October!   And Congrats to Marie on her acceptance to San Francisco!  I'm so sad to see you go, and I'm going to miss you a ton, but maybe this will give me an excuse to come out and visit - I can see both Marie and Sarah!  I'll miss you though, and best of luck!

      Wow, so I didn't think I'd be sad, but I'm actually getting kind of sad to leave.  Only a little over an hour left here - I've been working on the same order all day :-)  It's kind of the shittiest thing I've ever written b/c I only had a day to listen to the evidence...oh well - it isn't like the Judge isn't going to completely change it anyway :-)  Today hasn't been too bad...kind of boring but that's good for a last day.  My coworkers took me out to lunch at the local watering hole, Syds, fine dining, I tell ya...after work, I go pick up the nephew to come spend the night at grandma's..so that's always fun.  I still have some packing left to do - god, I'm so tired of moving!!!!  I expect ALL of you to come see the new apartment when it's all settled.  OH, and get this - I already have two assignments for the new school year.  I have reading to do in Evidence and in Administrative Law.  Hilarious.  I don't have the books yet even.  Law students are all work and no play, you know!  Or at least it seems!  I'm determined to start this school year off well with the homework - no skipping and no falling behind like last year.  Don't want to have any more Jessi Spano moments like I did last year (ha, for those of you who had to witness those, I'm sorry!)  Well, better finish my final decree for the Judge!  Who wants to get a drink to celebrate?

      Yay!  Last day for work this summer!  VERY happy about this - I mean, I'll miss people here but it's nice that I'll get a break for at least a little while...a week, but hey, can't complain, right?  So, today, I still have one more order to write and put out - and then organize my desk and return stuff.  I wish I had someone who would meet me for lunch somewhere b/c today's a "go-to-lunch kind of day."  But alas, no such luck.  I got a futon frame, desk and dresser last night for the apartment.  I'm almost all set - we're moving stuff in tomorrow and then meeting Ryan for lunch/dinner :-)  I get to spend the evening with my favorite little guy, the Collin-man.  So, this weekend should be pretty good!  Until then, it's my last divorce that I must write!   Good luck Jame at the Opening Ceremonies today!!!!!

      It's Thursday - which means tomorrow is my LAST day working this summer!  Exciting, no?  I still have so much to do, which means I will be working my butt off until tomorrow afternon, but hey, at least that will make the time go by quicker!  I'm all tired this morning....not sure why.  I'm silly - I get up at 5:00 to work out, eat breakfast and then change my mind and go back to bed for another hour.  Perhaps my body is protesting me getting up that early?  Who knows...anyway, had a good night last night - Erika and I did dinner at Bahama Breeze which has quickly become my favorite restaraunt and did some shopping.  I'm going to miss her and Caitlynn :-( Yes, I'm still sad about leaving everyone next week - I hope I get to see everyone before I leave!  My room is a disaster with boxes and bags since I have to pack everything to take on Saturday.  Latest update on the couch thing - I have a futon mattress but no frame :-) Ha, that won't do me much good, but I think we're going to get the frame tonight...I'll just have a bed in my living room - no couch type frame - who needs that?  :-) Well, my work is waiting for me and it's calling my name.  I must answer it!  Laters!

      b/c I'd like to knock myself out to get rid of this headache!!!!  Damn the migraine - Steph, isn't there a song about migraines by Trubble Hubble?  It's my theme song for the day, if I can remember how it goes!

      I'm going to rip my brain out seriously - my head isn't liking me this morning.  It must be protesting the fact that i got up this morning to work out b/c I have the worst migraine.  And I gotta work - must finish this divorce today - yes, the divorce I've been working on since the beginning of July.  I got a 2 hour talk about it yesterday, and even though he said I did better than my last order, I still have to redivide the property.  That is one reason why I don't want to be a divorce lawyer - property division sucks.  More than anything has sucked before.  Parties never tell the truth about anything they own which is ironic b/c they DO take some kind of oath when they come on the stand, but that doesn't seem to matter to some people.  Or if I AM a divorce lawyer, I will make sure to provide the judge with everything possible that he will need to make a fair decision.  B/c as I stand now it is virtually impossible (and the judge agrees with me) to fairly divide this property.  You can't fairly divide an estate if you don't know how much every item IS.   So, yes, I'm drinking my black coffee, poppping my Excedrin Tension Headache and wearing the glasses in order to see this morning...Must get this order done!  3 more days!!!!

      augh...Have any of you just been in a shitty mood for no apparent reason? Everything and anything is stressing me out today...I went to the cardiologist - he was pissing me off, the nurses were pissing me off, my mother was pissing me off...the girl who rang me up at the salad bar at Marsh was rude...I'm just in an all around shitty mood and there's no chocolate in sight here. So, I'm awaiting my meeting...I did get my editing back for these orders and I have huge changes to make yet again, even to the divorce that I had to totally rewrite and I thought I did much better on!!! And I'm getting stressed about moving and leaving everyone and I'm wound so tight right now I might just lose it on someone...some poor soul who probably will do nothing to deserve it and then I'll end up having to apologize and feel like an ass...it's a vicious cycle :-) so, word of advse to all of you I live with, close to, or have any contact with whatsoever - Alaina's in one of THOSE moods :-P And if you know me well enough, you know just what those moods entail.

      I think I might celebrate every day as the last ______ of this week.  Who knows...so, I'm getting ready to start my work this morning.  Another day, another divorce!  Not much going on today except I have ANOTHER doctor's appointment and then a meeting with Judge Dredd to discuss everything from this summer - yeah, I'm really really looking forward to that meeting (note the sarcasm).  You know, it's a good thing that I have insurance with all these doctors appointments I've had lately.  At least at this appointment I get to bitch to the doctor about Friday's screw-up.  Yep, I have pictures and everything.  Those people at the Imaging Center are going down!  ha ha...don't mess with a law student!  Anyway, hopefully I'll be able to make it to my nephew's purple belt karate class - I'll miss getting to go to those classes.  The kids are so funny!  Well, alas, I suppose I should work...I already drank my coffee for the day and I have to let it wear off before my appointment, so I don't have anything too fun to look forward to today - Starbucks is my favorite part of the morning!  It's like Cheers there for me - everyone knows my name! :-)  Laters!

      Wow - so I can tell this week is going to be long!  Now, when I say long, I don't necessarily mean bad, but I think since it is my last week, fate will just play it like that - make me suffer as long as I can in my cubicle.  Augh - yeah, I'm bored...and I'm not sure why I'm posting but I am b/c I have 10 more minutes and I MUST find something to do with my time :-)  ha, I'm pathetic!  I feel like I should watch Office Space tonight...too bad my copy is at Dayton!

      So, I'm starting my last week at the court house.  It feels weird that summer is almost over, but I'm definitely ready for it to be over.  This summer has kicked my ass, but I've come out the winner, I think :-)  Only have a few more divorces to work on and then it's no more divorces for awhile! Yay!  So, the weekend was great!  Didn't do much Friday b/c of the whole doctor incident that day...but Saturday was absolutely wonderful.  Thank you to Ryan for showing me the sites of small-town Ohio.  :-)  I've been a smiling idiot since Saturday...yesterday, well, I said I was going to work on my resume, but I ended up doing everything BUT that until like 8:00 p.m.  I did do some work, though...so at least I can have a small sense of accomplishment in my job search.   As much as I'm excited to leave - I'm also sad that I won't be seeing certain people for awhile...Erika, my family -yes, every single one of them - and I'm sad to leave my niece and nephews b/c the twins were just getting to know me and I'm going to really miss my little buddy, Collin ;-( sniff, sniff...maybe I can move them all with me?  Not likely...but it's a nice thought....well, better get to work!  These divorces won't write themselves!!  laters!

      Ok, so you know how I said I would kick today's ass? Yeah, opposite. I had a CAT scan done today instead of an MRI, but the CAT scan did NOT go well. They inject this dye into your veins to do the x-ray; well, my first vein couldn't take it so it "blew" and the dye got all in my skin - and it HURT like a bitch. And I was already scared to death when I got in there so I freaked out. I mean, total panic attack, I couldn't calm down. We tried the other arm and that worked but I was already well past upset by the time it came to that. I have been to the doctor, been poked and prodded and x-rayed three different times this week, and I just want to scream. My arm is swollen and will be for some time apparently.  So, I need a good weekend dammit. I'm back at work b/c I feel bad about missing so many hours, but I can't concentrate worth a crap. We'll see how long this lasts. I'd like to go take a nap now, actually. Outside, that is b/c it's BEAUTIFUL out there! No one should have to work on days like this (quoting Ferris Bueller). I think I might need a drink tonight and a bunch of hugs from a certain someone tomorrow.

      sigh, so finally the weekend is here - well, almost - I'm in the office - bright and early this morning, 7:00 a.m.  I'm so behind on my work...seriously. I ended up staying in the office until 7:00 p.m. last night - I probably wouldn't have left if Ryan hadn't called and distracted me.  I was in my "zone."  So, I'm here until 12:00 and then it's back  to the MRI. I think I've decided that I don't want to come back after it.  This week has been total bullshit with teh doctor situation, so maybe I deserve to take the afternoon off.  Or maybe I'm just creating excuses :-)  Weekend plans - god knows tonight what I'll end up doing - my Gilmore Girls DVD is finished so what am I going to watch now? :-)  Saturday I'm heading to Ohio to spend the day with Ryan, and then Sunday - MUST work on my resume and cover letters.  It's truly sad to think I already have to think about next summer, but I must.  Until then, I have my Starbucks in hand and I'm ready to kick some ass this morning!

      I hate the people at the Noblesville Imaging Center.  They made some kind of "boo boo" while doing my MRI on Monday so I have to go in tomorrow afternoon to do it AGAIN.  OK, so this is the 3rd doctor's appointment I have had this week, and all three have been pretty "not-so-fun" appointments.  And I've missed so much work, so I'm pissed about that...all around, Nain is pissy today.  Pissy pissy pissy.  I might just take it out on these people I'm writing divorces for.  Looks like today will be a work through lunch and work late night, huh?  Arg.

      Ha!  So, I've heard from 3 different people (attorneys) that Judge Hughes felt just awful for last week and his taking his bad mood out on me.  Yeah, funny, though b/c I never got an apology.  One of the attorneys basically said that I'm working for the "Bobby Knight" of judges, so I guess that's good b/c if there's anywhere I can get thick skin as a lawyer, it would be here, huh?  So, it's almost time for the normal work day to be over...unfortunately, I still have night court to do.  I did get to get out of the office today, however - lunch with the sister and nephew.  I wanted to go to the arcade with them, too, but sadly, Aunt Nain had to work.  Alas...the life of a working stiff!

      Ok, so it's morning, and I'm sitting in my cubicle, yet again, trying to think of a way to motviate myself to work.  At least I got the Starbucks this morning and at least I'm not still tripping off of xanex post-MRI anymore.  But it's one of those rainy days where all you'd rather do is be inside watching movies.  Definitely not one of those rainy days where you want to be sitting in an office working on divorces.  Anyone have a good way of having the day go faster?  It's going to be an 11 hour one today.  Night court.  Always a good time to be had by all, but I must make up the hours missed for the MRI and the appointment yesterday.  Anyway, so I did get to see the cheerleaders yesterday with Andrea - they're not half bad, but I am considering finding some riddilin (definitelynot spelling that correctly), grinding it up and putting it in their sports drinks.  I don't remember having that much energy or even being that annoying when I was in 8th grade...maybe I'm wrong, but seriously...these girls are very annoying.  Hmm....now I realize why I never would have made the "cheerleader type." I'm just too serious or cynical.  Imagine that :-)  Well, must work.  I don't want to, but....we can't always get what we want, now can we?  Maybe tonight will be fun and I'll see people I know be before the judge for possession or public intox!  Ha, that could be entertaining!  Laters!

      oh sweet lord, people, I cannot for the life of me wake up!  I  have had 2 caffeinated drinks today, and I'm afraid if I have another one I might start shaking AND still be tired :-(  Note to self - do not take that much xanex in the future.  I will never do that again.  So, I'm wasting company money today.  I'm thinking about going upstairs to the library and hiding out so people don't blatantly see me not being productive as I'm doing right now.  But then I'm afraid that if I did do that, the drugs would take over and I'd fall asleep with my face in a law book.  Ha, that would be funny, however.  Anyone have any good suggestions on how to stay awake?  Caffine has been tried...unless I had some straight Jolt, I think that's a moot cause.  Augh...must....work....must...keep....going...

      Morning folks.  So, Alaina is TIRED this morning...well, it's almost afternoon, but I'm still tired!  I had my MRI yesterday.  And well, I thought that since I was so nervous that it would be best to take 2 instead of 1...ha ha..well, I'm still out of it if that's any indication of my drug tolerance.  And then I had another doctors appointment this morning...so...my only question is..is it Friday yet?  Seriously!  This weekend was fun though - I got to spend Saturday with one of my favorite people - which was fabulous, and then Sunday I "tried" to help Erika move, but sometimes it's hard to do that b/c it's like there are too many cooks in the kitchen if you all know what I mean..I think that's why I like to move on my own - you can do it the way YOU want it done. And I spent the remainder of Sunday freaking out about Monday's impending MRI.  I guess you could say the good news is all the bad stuff is done for the week, right?  No big plans...suppose to go see Andrea coach cheerleading again today but that all depends on how awake I can keep myself...the drugs still haven't worn off completely!  I tell you, if I was a hardcore pain killer addict, we'd have some issues!  well, it's time to go to lunch with the jury!  write more later!
