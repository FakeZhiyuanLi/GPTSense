      Savannah and I left&nbsp;Wrexham Lodge this morning, the first place we stayed in London, and took the Tube back to Heathrow Airport. Our plane leaves in two hours. This time, I will not miss the plane. Savannah will not misplace her luggage. We will get out of here with some semblance of control and order.  &nbsp;  It was raining as we were leaving. Big heavy drops, wetting the luggage and reminding me of Eugene in the spring. Damn I miss Oregon. Can't wait to be back. Too bad "back" is Klamath Falls.  &nbsp;  After a breakup and a remarkable trip to Europe, I'm not looking forward to coming back to the home that isn't. To tell you the truth, I'm fed up with just about everything Southern Oregon. At least I have my dog, assuming he hasn't run away in the last two weeks.  &nbsp;  I have four minutes left on this Internet terminal, but I think I'll throw out an idea anyway.&nbsp; I'm thinking about the military again. I always think about this stuff when I go through a breakup. I always loath myself after being rejected by womankind (because one woman DOES represent EVERY woman giving me the finger.) And I yearn after something like the Army, where they can change some of my bad habits, I hope, and give me a sense of discipline.  &nbsp;  This time I'm a bit more serious than I have been in the past. I no longer want to be a grunt on the field. I am, however, contemplating military intelligence -- i know, i know, it's an oxymoron -- but it's something that I feel I might be good at. Like journalism, the idea is to get a complete picture of something and relay it to the people who need that information. But unlike journalism, there's more than just one set deadline. Perhaps it might instill a sense of self control. Or maybe it would be terrible. I don't know, it's just an idea.  &nbsp;  I'll be back in Klamath Falls -- and therefore, back with OneMoreWriter -- in about a day. This will be my last post on EuroWriter. Thank you everyone for reading, and thank you for all the kind thoughts.

      Warning: This post is one drawn out emotional tirade. If you've ended/started a relationship recently, you might see the paralells in your own life. Or you might care what's going on in mine. But if you're a random reader, you may not want to bother. I got a slew of e-mails recently from a few women who were really offended by something I wrote two years ago, and took it upon themselves to tell me all the ways I've wronged the female sex. Oh well. Anyway, I think that's all been patched up, but they wanted to make it perfectly clear I'm a boring writer. That's the kiss of death for me, by the way, I'm a writer because I hate reading boring stuff. But this Web log isn't my job, it's just a rant. So read if you want. Thanks, this concludes the disclaimer.  ...  I wish ... I wish I took longer to know people, to trust people, to start relationships and to carry them out. It is maddening, being here, watching Savannah, waking up next to her, knowing that each day is counting down to Sunday, after which time we won't have any need to see each other again.  That fact is both terrible and wonderful. I am counting down the days. But I am cherishing them, too.  I can't start mourning for the relationship until we're apart. How do I mourn for what I've lost, what we've lost? She's still right there next to me, happy to hold my hand if I need it, but shying away if I look her in the eyes.  God this girl is beautiful. It would be so much easier if she were ugly. Or stupid, or mean, or any number of failings. Instead, she's there listening to me, asking "what's wrong?" when I'm having a particularly hard time, or giving me space when I obviously need it.  And that's why this is wonderful. Savannah still cares about me. She's clinging to me on this trip, because in many ways I'm the only thing that's reminiscent of home in her first real trip away from her parents. And she's clinging to me because we have a history together these last six months, and there's a solid friendship there.  But it's horrible, knowing she doesn't love me any more.  "It's difficult for me," I tell her Tuesday. "I see you there, next to me, and all I want to do is kiss you. And I know, in my head, that we haven't worked out and it's all wrong. But my emotions tell me otherwise. And there's still this chemistry..."  She hugs me, but puts her cheek to the side, you know, the way a girl does when she wants to kiss you, but can't, or knows you want to kiss her, but shouldn't.  "You're right, there's still this chemistry," she says. "My body still wants to be with you. But my emotions tell me otherwise."  And with that, she withdraws from the embrace and leaves the room.   ...   I don't know why Savannah fell out of love. I don't know why suddenly, two months ago, I lost all confidence in this relationship and started getting a sick feeling in my stomach every time I thought about the future. There's so many factors that could have contributed.  But I know this: I'm through with falling in love with a girl in three weeks. I'm through with saying "forever" before I've spent a month with someone. You'd think I'd learn by now. I've dated five women, three of them very seriously. With all three (Ruth, Ali and now Savannah) I was head over heels three weeks in. I gave up everything to be with them.  Savannah has been a growing experience. I've learned to trust someone who's loved and cared about me as much as I have about her. I've been with someone where I didn't start changing who I was. And for the first time, I was dating someone without trying to mold their plans and their dreams into something I could live with. I just ... let it be.  And now it's fallen apart. I am no longer the man Savannah wants to be with. She says there is no one else right now. But with a woman like her, it won't take long before the men start lining up on her doorstep.  I've wondered many times: Did I make a mistake in trusting Savannah? What was I doing dating a high schooler? What did I think would happen when she graduated and started off on her own?  I don't think I failed. Honestly, I think this wasn't in God's plan. Part of me knew that from the start. But I continued it anyway.  And now it's gone. And I'm contemplating how to start over again in love. Whether to ignore girls for a year or two, letting work, God and friends attain top priority over dating. Whether to have some senseless flings and break a few hearts. Whether to make a career move.  I'd appreciate the prayers of anyone so inclined. Thanks for reading this tome. Bedtime now, I've got to see a castle in the morning.

      Screw the column. I was going to talk about Paris. But I don't feel very inspired. And plus, my newspaper hasn't contacted me about it, so I don't think they really care. Today, instead: Hartfordshire House, the country estate in England where Savannah and I have been staying since Monday.  Savannah and I are staying in a guest room on the third floor of the house. The second floor, really, because the British don't consider the ground floor to be a number. I can't say we're really inconveniencing our hosts, David and Diana Hiemann, because they have an 18 room estate, huge farm yard, apartments in Chelsea, London, and a host of other assets.  I've never seen anything quite like this. The closest thing we have to this in the states is a Southern plantation, or perhaps a New England estate. They have a driver, a Cockney named Bill. They have two maids, who also are housekeepers and do various other tasks, two black Labs and this tiny little rag who sometimes resembles a dog.  David and Diana are awfully nice. Savannah is their grand-niece, so they pamper her silly. And me, too, because I'm along for the ride. Tuesday, they sent us to London to see Fame, because they know the fellow who produces it. Thursday, we're seeing Saturday Night Fever, which is here for the first time in London. Today we're off for some shopping, and to see a castle. (I would kill myself if I got back stateside without seeing a real English castle.)  The British have a reputation, I think, of being rather stuffy, especially those who are rich. I have found this to be untrue. Although David and Diana are wealthy, they are wonderfully polite, and perfectly accomodating of us Americans, even if I can't remember which fork to use at dinnertime or figure out whether I should eat a chicken leg with utensils or my fingers.  The two of them are remarkably educated, too. They seem to know more about American politics than I do, and I fancied myself a political expert before this trip. I know nothing, it seems, plus I have no idea what's going on in the world. The newspapers here are better, too. Their tabloids have far more news, their dailies have smarter stories, and they give more credence to daily columnists.  There are some differences here between America and Europe, especially in the way they do things such as advertisements, or their views on modesty. For instance, one of the news tabloids, which seems a perfectly respectable sort, has a pinup girl on page three every morning, breasts unbared for the world to see. Right next to the picture is perfectly serious copy about politics, or the latest golf game, with nothing else about the nudity. I could get used to this in a newspaper ...  Their ads are smarter, too. They generally assume the people reading them are literate, and pander to a slightly higher intelligence than our "big truck GOOD" or "beer is sexy" psychology in the states.  And that's all I feel like writing, now. I am, after all, on vacation. Oh well, off to see a castle. More later, perhaps. And eventually, I'll get around to Paris, which was marvellous.
