      ok, so about politics... now before you get all rabid at the mouth and fired up let me say we will NOT be discussing politics its futile and it just irritates me I have my own strong opinons and I tend to get all in a bother as it were when people start firing off their crazy views! Trust me this room is only big enough for one crazy person and me being crazy enough for two or three people, I fill the room out nicely!  but, anyway as I was saying politics here is what I don't understand. Let's say you are minding your own business in ... oh let's say a Yahoo game room trying to play some online Scrabble (aka Literati) and burn away your mind numbing day at the office or maybe you are there because you cant sleep and you are just trying to bore yourself into a REM cycle whatever your reason there you are playing a freaking online board game with strangers. Simple enough. When low and behold someone enteres the game chat room with a name they have created that is something like "Vote for mystupidass candidate in 2004" except of course it has all kinds of underscores in weird places and such. As if thata wasn't enough they have to say something to the effect of vote for Mystupidasscandidate because he is the best choice go my guy!".  well you wouldn't think that wopuld so much of an issue I mean I certainly don't care who this person votes for and its a free country and all so go for it buddy I continue my game.  Here is where it gets weird. The second this happens the whole chat room goes wild with 6081 reasons why this persons political opinions are ridiculous and absurd. They begin to say truly assinine things like (and I'm not kidding here) " I would rather see my children burn to death in a fire than see your candidate in office" (is there another way to burn to death? chemical burn? what the hell.... " I would rather die than see your candidate in office" (then would it really matter? I mean your dead. ) " I will move to Canada. I swear if your candidate is elected!"  Now, this all amuses me. It amuses me a lot in fact. It also baffles me I mean I can't help but search for some meaning in the order and severity of threats made if this person is elected into office. Let's look at them :  1. burned children 2. death 3. move to Canada.  This just makes me laugh I mean how funny is it that this person really thinks that moving to Canada is just slightly better than losingn their children and/or their lives. I'm not a fan of Canada either so much but really they have clean air and bears and such.  Of course the arguement doesn't end here the original person who promoted their choice for candidate in the first place starts listing off import issues while the rest of the room fires back. This wouldn't be so bad either if everyone wasn't quoting some news show or Lord forbid some damned actor. I mean if you must have an opinion make it your freaking own don't just plagiarize the thoughts of a morally bankrupt bored hollywood dolt or a stuff over paid political anyalist.  But on it goes for about 5 minutes until finally one side or the other starts calling the opposing candidate everything but a moo cow. Now don't get me wrong I can causs with the best of them, truly I must have been a sailor in another life" but, hass anyone's mind ever been changed by screaming obscenities at them. really think about this have you ever had a really strong opinion about something have someone call you fucking cunt ass loser and then suddenly seen the light and had an instant change of heart? umm... I'm gonna guess no on that one!  So, it degrades into a battle of who can come up with the most outlandish obscenitites to lob at the other dolt who of course takes the bait and slings trash right back at them.  Now, by this time I'm well, irritated because with my infinitely short attention span I only agree to play timed games of no more than 5 mins total ever! So, of course I have lost because I am watching these idiots go at each other in this chat room instead of paying attention to my mind numbing game and of course I do sympathize with one of the sides and yes the person against us is on my very last nerves because he has no idea what he is talking about and I'm just about to start cussing him out and offering to buy his ticket to the nearest Canadian border when I look at his profile and thank the Lord he has a pic of himself and I am instantly brought back to reality and I see that he is just an pathetic boob who can't even find a good picture of himself this picture I am not lying is taken from a webcame placed on the ground it would appear and he isnt even looking at the caamera so we get this great look at his goatee and recedeing hairline his huge forhead and bulbous nose. His rating is off the charts so it is painfully obvious he has no life what so ever especially considering he chooses to sit in the beginners lounge and make threats about going to Canada and burning children and laughing at everyone who does not have a rating of 2300 or more after 20 games claiming again he would just die and quit if he had played this many games and had not acheived such a rank of  honor! Bless his heart the poor thing.  So, I left him alone I mean I just felt bad for his lonely frito eating ass and his 700 cats and his web cam and teen porn.  sad.

       AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuters)   --  urlLink Unsolicited toe-licking  would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime.  A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.     What I find funny about this (beyond the obvious) is the idea of  unsolicited   toe-licking .  So, if someone comes up to you on the street and ASKS you to lick their toes, you're in the clear.  Better yet, if someone licks, say, your knees (your nose, your ears, your clavicle), there's really no problem.  Woohoo!  Pack your bags!  Let's go to Holland!

       so i was sitting there thinking today, and i got to wondering....what makes me so cool? is it because i'm captain of the football team? no. is it because i get straight a's? no. is it because i'm NHS president? no. is it because my favorite color is orange? yes. i mean, think about it. who else likes orange? nobody! i'm it! the ONLY PERSON!! you're looking at (sort of) the last remaining member of the orange tribe! if that doesn't set me apart from the riffraff, what does? let's face it, when halloween comes around and you all are shuddering at the tacky decorations, im loving it all. I should get extra points for that.

      According to Caroline Richmond of  urlLink Oldie Magazine , "Blogs are a dream come true for exhibitionists and bores. " I have to say that after browsing through a couple dozen of them yesterday, she is, for the most part, right on the money.  So why am I writing one myself? Because, no matter how much I want to believe it isn't true, I'm just like you.  I don't think it's so much that we're exhibitionists, as that we want to have a voice. We want to believe that somehow what we have to say is interesting or meaningful. We want to stand out in the sea of humanity and say, "Look at me! I'm special! I exist! I had something to say!" I don't believe that as individuals any of us are very special, but as a whole, we're rather interesting.  I considered how much to say about myself in this blog.... do I give my friends and family  urlLink witty nicknames  to disguise their identity? Do I fall into the internet anonymity trap, believing that if I keep my name to myself, I can somehow disguise who I am, start fresh, give you the impression that I'm somehow a little bit cooler, a little bit wittier, a woman of intrigue and mystery behind this vague internet mask called "Maddaleigh". Or, on the other hand, do I include my real name, my photo, and where I live, making this a bare portrait of what I consider to be reality?  I think the former. Because I know myself, I know that if I post my real name, and perhaps something of my professional writing, I'll self-edit.  This blog will become nothing more than a marketing piece and I'll create some super-woman blog, portraying myself as hard-working, infinitely creative, or particularly wise.  On my best days I'm those things, but rarely all at once.  I expect this blog to be full of opinions and ideas, rather than a diary of what I do from day to day.  I go to the store, I have conversations, I do my work, I watch some telly, and all of those other in between things like making the bed and sweeping corn-flies off the window ledges.   For 99% of the population, it's not what we  do  that makes us interesting, but what we  think .  So.... here I am... thinking.
