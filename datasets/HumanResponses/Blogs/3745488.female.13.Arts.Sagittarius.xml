      "Good Bye" I hate When I feel Numb Suddenly the urge to slash my wrists comes on I Can't take it anymore! Maybe My dad was right, Maybe I am nothing but a whore Just here to suffer every day I Don't know how much longer I can stay Honestly I Love my friends But I can't hold off the end It's Coming, I know I got the feel I swear the Grim-Reaper is real He talks to me at night And says "Suicide will stop this hellish fight" I know he wouldn't lie to me So you see I must now go As I Venture down below I want you to know, You were the reason I stayed during the past 4 months But it caught up with me, The Pain and Fear It's the end Good Bye My friend

      yeh.....i wrote this for julian....... it means a lot to me, it duznt make much sense but yeh.....   What brings your tears, what brings your sorrow? What brings your fears of no tomorrow? Why do you build this wall? Why won’t you let it fall? Don’t ask is this the beginning or is it the end. Bend the rules that do not bend. Find redeeming comfort in your grief. Bring to death what will not cease... Discover the barrier between life and death. Bringing to life what was gone for a breath. Find the strength within to set yourself free. Without it you are not you and I am not me. Do you see this never-ending tunnel of night? By which my soul is the dark and yours is the light? I am my grief and you are the death, which I grieve I never want this to leave. In that same instant you are the revival that in my grief, I search for to bring me back. You are all that I lack. You are my sorrow and my pain; you are my joy and my healing hands With you I feel more than all across the lands. Shed a tear, cry a river Forgive this world, become a giver. Hold me tight, show you care Find a way to share. For you are all and I am nothing without you, Look into my soul, you will find me wanting this too. We move on day by day, Your my sun glistening ray... Without the words that are not needed. We will always be us, together we are undefeated. You run through my veins and under my skin, Tell me of what is now and what has been. You are my heart and my essence, All things are now present tense. Bring yourself to death and watch me fall to the ground. You are my sky, my earth, and my lair. I breathe you to live, deprive me of you, take my air. Hold on tight, don’t let go, And forever know, If we fall, we fall together, For I feel destined to love you forever.  i know this blog is gonna be filled mostly with poems, but yeh......thats who i am, LIVE WITH IT!

      i know it sounds so corny, but this song seriously describes how i feel about my fiance, julian........ i luurrrvveeee him soo much.....  yeh anyways...the lyrics are to the song The Way by clay aiken.....  Theres something bout the way you look tonight, Theres something bout the way that i can't take my eyes off you. Theres something bout the way your lips invite, maybe its the way that i get nervous when your around. And I want you to be mine and if u need a reason why,   [Chorus:] Its in the way that you move me, and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight, its in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me, when I can't find the right words to say, u feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.  Theres something bout how you stay on my mind, theres something bout the way that I whisper your name when I'm asleep Oh no. Maybe its the look you get in your eyes. Oh baby its the way that makes me feel to see you smile. And the reasons they may change but what i'm feeling stays the same.  [Chorus]  I can't put my fingers on just what it is that makes me love you, you baby. So don't ask me to describe, I get all choked up inside, just thinking bout the way.  [Chorus]
