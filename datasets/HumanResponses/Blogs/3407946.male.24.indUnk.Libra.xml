      Today, for the first time in the two months that I have been here I drove and joined my other colleagues for lunch... I have joined them for lunch before but then I have never drove yet... So, it's kinda a first for me.  Well, luckily my car was acting fine... the air-con was functioning the way it is supposed to be was kinda worried that it will just stop working due to an old recurring problem. But it held... so I guess the lunch was pretty ok. It's been quite sometime already since I had some reasonable food ad reasonable price... although the need to drive, it was pretty much worth it, I guess.  During lunch, from my colleagues' conversation it appears to me that it might not be that easy to get converted to a permanent position here... It seems that there are quite a lot of contract extensions for the contract staff but not a lot of people can get a permanent position...  Now, that's a pretty disturbing thought... I left a permanent position at a pretty good company and come here hoping for the best, but now... I understand the company's position of wanting to offer contract positions initially but then I would not say I'm happy to know that it is possible that I might not have a job even if I have done my job properly... Looks like I might have made a very big mistake... kinda feel cheated, though... cause during the recruitment, it was put as though it is pretty easy to get a permanent position after the contract period and now looking at the situation  What the heck!!! At least I'm assured of a job for the next one year plus will start worrying about it next year... but probably have to keep my eyes opened for other offers also instead of being too loyal Loyalty does not pay, I guess...

      As usual, I had lunch alone today.... well, before you start thinking: "There must be something wrong with this guy..., eating lunch alone..." stop for a while and listen to my explaination the main reason I eat alone is... so that I can have the choice of keeping quiet when I just dun feel like talking i mean, when you eat with a bunch of people, you constantly have to look for something to say, else it'll get so silent that everyone will be feeling awkward... besides, what's wrong with eating alone? ok laa... i admit that i'm a bit of a weirdo  i'll even admit that i'm a bit anti-social... so what...
