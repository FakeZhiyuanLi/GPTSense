      	 MSN conversation: 11.17am   Iggbalbollywall  ( this is me ) says:  yo  Yipee Keye-yeah says: ( This is Chad, my best friend.)  Hey there.  How are things?  Iggbalbollywall says: not too bad...thought i was going to work yesteray; the car had other ideas  Yipee Keye-yeah says: So, it's getting better at least. That's good. The journal didn't instill me with a lot of confidence. I'd hate to see it go back to what it was, especially after you've been relatively happy for a while.  Iggbalbollywall says: oh yeah? what were your impressions?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not good. You're an awesome writer, of course, but I'm worried about you.   Iggbalbollywall says: ehh.. got thruogh before, and this time doesn't involve sharp objects Yipee Keye-yeah says: Yeah, well, I hope so.  A couple of coworkers just walked in and coincedentaly dropped off a bunch of stuff I wanted to borrow...it's like Christmas - extended LOTR DVD, PS2 and bunch of games, etc...   Ahhh...  *sigh*  Gonna be a great weekend! What else is going on?   Iggbalbollywall says: not too much, really, trying to figure out my day, might update the blog for the second time today  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Ah. I'll look forward to reading about all the positive things going on in your life now.  Iggbalbollywall says: updated daily, baybe  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Ah, that's funny!  I like the latest one...  Iggbalbollywall says: what else do you think i should mention?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: "unholy interest" heh In the Blog?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not sure...but I have a good handle, I think, on the problems. I want to hear about how great it is to be out of Calgary, living with Kurt, being a zoo caretaker, etc.  You don't talk about that stuff much anymore so it's a treat for me.    Iggbalbollywall says: aah...zee zoo..any other requests?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not sure...I don;t know what's going on in your life, really. Fill me in. Write a passage to me and I'll be happy.    So, Chad The Wick, this one�s for you.          Lucas Vs. Cordy     Poop and Pee  Lucas: Housebroken            						  Cordy:    She tries..

      	Some background on Jace, he's my mouthy friend from Calgary, who introduced myself to Kurt-the-Bed-Hog. He delievers pizza, and is generally pissed off at the world in a standup comedian type of way. He kept me sane in Calgary.   This guy from India is chatting me up on ICQ. I�ve noticed it comes in waves, every tard from India messages me for a month, then the Egyptians step up, then the folks from Sweden.  	Was all ready to go to work yesterday morning, despite the lesser rings of hell my head was in. I was pumped, out to placate the masses with an opiate (flair for the melodramatic much?). And, the car would not start. Not even a click. The battery was drained. For about 30 minutes, I truly felt I was life�s bitch, then I decided to shampoo the carpet, do the dishes, and phone people for The Cause as �Gentlemen Prefer Blondes� played demurely on the tube. I got one call back that didn�t pan out. So I ate some potatoes in a sauce from one of those envelopes, watched law and order, and felt sorry for myself a bit more. The pity party was ceased due to fatigue. I napped my brains out while Kurt tackled the laundry.  	I get in touch with the boss man today. Yikes. Is he going to believe my fabulous non-luck? Do I mention to him I�m a leeeeeeetle crazy? These are the questions I�d rather curl up into a ball and not deal with. There�s a crazy woman who keeps sending me messages on machine, evidently suffering from an emergency concerning her cable. Since I don�t actually deal with cable, and I gave her a thing with the Company�s number on it, I didn�t ever return her myriad of calls. I�m a jerk who sells dishes, but, in my defence, I don�t get paid, and in fact lose money whenever a fool calls me to complain about something. A typical compliant call lasts about forty minutes. Most of the time, the complaint has to deal with some aspect the client didn�t understand, so I get to go through the process with them again. If it�s not misunderstanding, it�s late installation, which has nothing to do with me, I�m not told the intsaller�s name, company or phone number. All right, that�s all for me, must attend to Cordy, who has taken an unholy interest in my underwear.

      this is from Jace.... You know, I feel a little weird muscling in (a laughable thought if you've ever seen me) on Robyn's coloumn, but it was a such a brilliant idea that I thought I should do it too.  However, I didn't want to copy my friend or steal the idea, so I decided to join her instead.  And she was gracious enough to allow me an occasional (yeah, right, I'll wear out my welcome in a matter of hours) cameo.  So I was at work today, driving pizza around, and I had to take an order to Sir John A Macdonald School.  Now I've never been there before, but apparently, it was one of three schools in the same parking lot thingy.  It was dark, and the damned schools don't have lights, and I was like "Uh, where is it?".  So I stop to ask this kid.  He was like twelve, small, typicial nerdy looking kid (ok, he was me when I was that young), sitting waiting for the bus.  I rolled down my window to ask him, and he took three leaps back from my car.  Like I was going to try and entice him into my tiny ass Samurai with pizza or something.  Can't fault the kid though, he was being smart.  Anyway, so I'm like "Hey, where's Deifenbaker (another of the schools there)."  He pointed behind me and hollered "there."  That's when my brain (which is usually a few seconds behind my mouth) kicked in and told that I already knew where Deif was (I had driven Meghan there several times).    So I tried again.  "I mean MacDonald."  The kid pointed even further behind me to the other side of Deif to where the Macdonalds restaurant and the Seven Eleven were.  "It's back there, the Big Yellow M gives it away."  Inwardly I groaned, but the kid had wit.  In spite of myself, I grinned.  "The school, Sir John A." I clarified.  He threw a backward gesture to the other brown brick cube on the corner.  "I can't get there from southbourn 4th St, can I?"  The kid shook his head.  "Nope, you'll have to go around."  So I turned around (going out the in ramp and diving over a few curbs) and went north on 4th, turned right onto 68th Ave to center and south to 64th, and then drove right past the entrance I needed to use, so I had to do it all again.  As much fun as driving in circles truly is, not so much when you're paid by the delivery.  So I finally get to the place, and get out of the car with the six larges, and I get swamped by dozens of chest high kids all shouting out for pizza.  I would have beaten them to pulp with my tire iron if I had had a free hand, but I finally got inside to the main office.  There I met a teacher in gym shorts and wearing a whistle around her neck (can you say humina humina humina) and I was looking for a Wade Copper.  Now I've known females named Wade before (ever see Sliders?), so I was hoping that she was the one.  Nope, turned out to be a bigger version the directions kid from the bus stop (I shudder to think that that would be me if I lived that long, which I won't)  And his name was Cooper, not Copper.  Some retard at work doesn't know how to spell.  And her name starts with L and rhymes with Xena.  Anyway, one of the other teachers got at the pizza and snagged a slice before Mr Cooper showed, but he caught the guy eating it when he came in.  He gave me a dirty look.  "I'm not paying for it if it's got a slice missing."  I groaned.  He looked serious, and it was a sixty dollar bill.  Then he smiled and gave me seventy bucks.  SCORE.  So I boogied (as in hurried, not as in 'EWWWW, Pick yer nose') back to the store and in the parking lot in front of the store, there are rows that people are supposed to park in that are contained by cement islands (Kurt knows what Im talking about, he used to work there, in fact, he got me my job there), and when the lots filled, people sometimes park on the other side of the islands in the place where you drive through.  So theres this woman driving a burgundy Buick Regal parked on the outside, and instead of pulling out foward and merging into the lane, she backs into one of the aisles.  Only she doesn't know the dementions of her car, and she backs right into the ass end of a parked brand new, all clean and shiny blue Monte Carlo.  Ouch.  I see this as I drive past, and I'm like "Whoa, that's gotta suck."  but you know what happened then?  Yep, that's right.  The bitch drove away, dragging a peice of the other car's bumper along with her.  I was livid.  But I was too far away to get her liscence number, and the lot was so blocked I couldn't hang a louie and follow her.  It was nuts.  Well, there is it, my first (and hopefully not last) cameo into the wild world of Robynism.  Quack.  Signed: The Angry Mallard Duck.

      	So, really thought I was getting better, was sure that I would be able to work yesterday. I woke up at five, did the blog, fed the animals, and read. Kurt woke up as I was starting to fall back to sleep.  	Kurt woke me up around two thirty in the afternoon. I was shaking, almost incoherent, headache, feverish, and ready to vomit. In other words, despite the dramatic increase in my hours of sleep, I felt like it was my first day of withdrawal. Yow. 	 So yesterday was a non day.  	But, Kurt got groceries, I was able to stand up long enough to do the dishes, and thusly, for a non day, not so bad. Oh, and one of our foster kitties, the Terror, formerly known as Raccoon got adopted yesterday. And I never took a picture of him, or his lovely sisters. We�re foster parents for a non-kill humane society. Homeless kitties come to our places, get socialized, and go to homes. It�s wonderful, but Terror was with us for a while, and I was starting to get attached. So was Cordy, our puppy. Those two were curled up together constantly, play fought, and when Terror got a nasty skin allergy, Cordy was the nursemaid. And when Terror left, Cordy tried to get through the window. She fell asleep, then got up, and sniffed the apartment thoroughly looking for him. It was pretty sad, but we�re also getting more kittens to socialize soon. My landlord mentioned that he wasn�t all that impressed with the Zoo, but he hasn�t decided to take any action, most likely because we got his wife�s permission beforehand� (hahahaa!) Besides, it�s not like our apartment is dirty, since I�m a clean freak and all. (messy, oh hell yes, but never dirty.) 	I�m going to try for being a productive little salesfreak today. I also pass in a resume to a coffee shop today as well. Baker! Twenty hours a week, but I figure I need something, somewhere that gives me a measure of job satisfaction. Being the door to door opiate pusher is not doing it for me, and although I do enjoy it to a certain extent, at least with the baker job, there�s no commission so it�s something a bit steady to supplement the unsteady. 	My boss asked again what I have that has been incapacitating me. I covered it with the blood work that I got done Monday, �they don�t know yet.� I am so much at a loss as to what to tell him. I am worried that he�ll find a way to relieve me of work (Yeah, it�s not legal, to discriminate because of illness, but if he wanted to, he�d find a way to work around it) I also really respect and like the guy. I�m worried that he�ll think differently about me, lose respect for me, etc. I know it sounds silly, but this is Old School Rural Land, where any sort of medication for a mental illness is termed �Nerve Pills�. 	Oh hey, update on that whole undergrad thing. I�ve got it. When my university gets the transfer credit from this summer, I�m officially done. (I guess I�m informally done now)

      A friend wrote with reference to my one of my blog entries. He asked me �what makes a person more, or less?� this is reference to me writing earlier that I feel less with this illness.  Boy, do I ever. I guess the important thing to note here is that feelings do not give a person an accurate sense of reality. As a really lame example, you may feel purple. You don�t look purple, you don�t smell purple, but purple you really, really feel you are. How many times have your feelings fooled you? How many times have you thought you were in love, then, all of the sudden, you really fell in love, and you realised the feelings previous were fondness, lust, or a combination of these and other feelings? 	Feelings can betray you. For me, they do to the point of messing up my worldview, my sense of reality, in such a way that I don�t know my arse from my elbow. I have no idea what I look like, save for in the vaguest sense (I have brown hair, brown eyes, I�m about 160 cm. My hair is long and curly. I don�t know if I am overweight, although I know I am not skinny. People vary when they tell me what I look like, I�ve been compared to everyone from Eddie Vedder to Julia Ormond. Basically, I don�t know what I look like to others. I suppose it doesn�t matter. I�d still like to know, though) 	My reality right now is that I am less than pretty much everyone. Less because I see myself as not functioning properly. I am hard pressed to cite someone I view as less than me, because, like everybody, I give other people the benefit of the doubt. Of course, I�m not as forgiving with myself. Stupid, really, but I don�t have much control over what I feel, and, maybe the essence of this illness is that your feelings control you, whereas perhaps a healthy person would be able to dismiss, get over, or otherwise cope with these feeling of worthlessness, doubt, self-loathing, etc.  	What is a person worth? If you are human, according to Christian doctrine, you are worth Jesus Christ. (Please note the requirement is merely being human. Not a  damn thing else.) Pretty amazing, not to mention scary. If you are a Buddhist, your worth your service and compassion to other people, but the ultimate truth there is that you are nothing in the end, soulless (according to some sects). You are a non-self connected to the divine. Most folks, well, I think it�s pretty individual as to what they feel they�re  worth, so I�ll say, I�m not sure. 	What are my family members worth? (This includes, friends, my husband, my dear and precious animals) Before, I would say that I�d die for them. Now, what I�m saying is that I�m trying to live for them. They are worth me trying my hardest to get out of the funk I�m in, and they�re worth me growing old with them, and seeing them grow old. Holding their hand when they�re sick, getting silly drunk if the situation calls for it, sharing my experiences with them. This is what they�re worth.  	What am I worth? I wish I knew.   	I am going to write more later dealing with daily events. And, as I don�t know why my new settings aren�t taking, I�ll leave a note here; if you want to give me feedback, whether it be to ask a question, give me advice, or to let me know I�m a big moron, and, were this a hardcopy journal, you wouldn�t wipe your ass with the pages. You know, anything. My email address is trickyhighlands@hotmail.com

      	I don�t know why it�s bothering me so much. It�s natural, tons of people get them, it�s pretty easy to treat, and aw, fuck it. I think it�s horrible. Somewhere along the way, most likely from being in customers� houses all over, I contracted head lice. HEAD LICE! 	I�ve never had them before. All I have (had) were nits, just weird little eggs of the blood sucking parasites. I home remedied it, as I am not interested at all in being treated with chemicals. So, it was mayonnaise on my head for two hours, under a plastic bag, under a towel. I smelled fan-fucking-tastic. After this, Kurt fine combed my hair, pulled out all the nits he could find. I made him do it twice more, he couldn�t find any. 	This is what it looked like. http://www.headlice.org/faq/notnit.htm I also got the confirmation here that mayo works just as well on lice as many other products, without the pesticide component that those pesticides offer. Don�t get me wrong. I may still get the pesticide, but that�ll be when my next scheduled dosing is (in a week). An interesting side note, after the saladirific experience, my hair is crazy shiny, manageable, and generally nice to touch and look at. 	In other news, Kurt and I got help from the University Chaplain here. He arranged for us to get a food voucher from the grocery store, and a raid to the local church�s Public Cupboard. We now have canned food, and tomorrow, 50 bones worth of groceries. This is a great and unexpected relief. Of course, I feel guilty about it, I�m of the mind that we didn�t need the food, we weren�t in dire straits. Some one else, on the other hand, might be, and he or she might have wanted that can of re-fried beans. However, after eating something other than porridge, and getting a call to pay some miscellaneous bill, I�m thankful. The money I get at the end of the month can go to the bill paying, instead of the food buying. Words can�t express how utterly thankful I am, despite my stupid guilty feelings.  	How did I get lice? I feel like Pigpen from �peanuts�. Yeah, yeah, I know they don�t care how clean you are, but I remember being a kid, and a teen and a young adult around home. I was taught, not so much by what my parents said, but how people acted when the term �lice� was applied anywhere. Poor hygiene was implied. So, hey, at least this is a lesson in humilty, I�m not going to make a face or go �eeewwww� when someone talks about lice in the future. The funny thing is, a really good friend of mine found out her infestation, and that�s what drove me to get my head checked. I didn�t think she was gross, I remember thinking that she had real shitty luck. I get it, and I�m Pigpen. Go figure. 	I hope to be out and about to my loyal satellite-buying public tomorrow. Also, on Thursday, I apply for a part time bakery job. I figure I need some sort of job satisfaction somewhere, as I�m developing moral issues about selling lots of TV to people. I feel like an ignorance peddler. I am an ignorance peddler. It�s a living I guess.

      4.12 am    	It�s been rainy and wet here for the last week or so. I think I�d almost prefer snow to it; nothing gets done with the rain. It rains, it gets dried up, all in all, I prefer lasting evidence of precipitation. Of course, on our sojourn here, I failed to pack mitts, scarves, hats, etc.  (Hey now, it was august, who thinks months in advance? I even forgot socks�) 	Another sleepless night for me. I hate it, not sleeping is uncomfortable at the least for me, but at the same time, I enjoy the prescribed silence, the aloneness. It�s not like it was for me in the past (I�ve been a veteran insomniac since high school) I was lonely then. Nighttimes were peaceful, but sad. My family, friends, pets, roommates all were breathing quietly, sleeping, as if it were no effort. Kurt, however, has given me permission to wake him, and I�ve only done so once, but it gives me a lot of comfort to know that I can wake him up if I need to, and that he won�t be pissy at me for doing so.  	Watched a documentary on depression last night. It didn�t tell me anything terrifically new, as I�m morbidly informed on this disease and its treatments. One thing interested me though; patients with depression, as well as other mental disorders have a marked difference in their brains. That means a person can see it. They can see the disease, detect it, look at it, and be able to say �Yes. This is a physical thing.� My extended family on my mothers� side have always had the notion that depression was a character flaw; that I could snap out of it at any time. When my meds began to work, they advised me to get off the drugs, that I clearly didn�t need them anymore. I would patiently explain that the reason I was better was because I was taking the pills, that ceasing them would, or �the dope� as my grandmother calls it. Among the other notions they have: I�m lazy, irresponsible, and unstable. It�s hard to argue with the last, I�m lazy because the drugs I were on that �helped� me �sleep� knocked me out cold for twelve hours. I slept during the day (because when I didn�t take my pills, nights were spent like this.) I�m not sure where the irresponsible thing came in. It is consoling that they take the same hard line against every one else in the family. Different criticisms, same results; the frustration that abounds in the accused, and the pressing need of the same to avoid the family. 	My puppy, Cordy, a loveable half-Rotweiler, half Shepard, jumped into the shower with us this evening. Of course, since the opportunity presented itself, Kurt and I gave her an impromptu bath. She was unimpressed with us, but still maintains the same ardour and zeal for the bathroom. Lucas, my pride and joy, will not go near the bathroom, even if there were an entire rump roast on the floor. He hates water. Ironic, since his heritage gives him webbed feet and a coat designed to get wet. 	  Everyone must experience this guy's paintings. They�re wonderful, surreal, and disturbing.  http://www.markryden.com/  Blood test tomorrow (later!) to determine if i have another illness. I almost wish i did, missing work would feel more leigitimate to me.

      Good morning,  Its unfortunate the only time I feel awake in the morning is when I�m looking at the wrong end of it. Went to the doctor, told him about the stupid symptoms I had. He was very sympathetic, didn�t tell me anything useful except why taking tryptophan at this juncture wouldn�t be the best idea; and he gave me more Prozac. I went home; fell asleep (ASLEEP!!! Thank you, God) at 11 or so. Woke up at three, and here were are, 5.29am. Kurt has a weird staph infection, and I�m hoping I won�t be pooping green and yearning to vomit on Sunday. Sunday is Flea Market Day. This is when Kurt and I get to experience the flea market culture, rife with ten thousand year old ladies selling ten thousand year old lace doilies. At least twice during this period a guy will tell me how he�s going to sue the company I�m working for, because of some misunderstanding (usually on the guy�s behalf.) I use my conflict management training, and sit there, speaking softly, while these retards spew spittle over me in an attempt to illuminate why me selling satellites for this company is, in fact, an evil thing. Why these guys feel the need to expouse their problems that occurred three years ago with me, a person that can�t do anything for them, doesn�t care, and had nothing to do with their unfortunate situation is beyond me. I�m polite, but at the same time, I can feel the burning in my cheeks, and the need to freak out at them. Especially when his yelling (why is it always a guy?) draws the attention of a few locals. I hate drawing attention to myself, especially when some one else draws attention for me.  	These freaks are few and far between. The other sellers in the place are interested to know how you�re doing; they�re genuinely concerned and curious about you. They�re also extremely friendly, something I take great comfort in at 7am. 	I�ve got to stop researching the drugs I�m on. Everything I find makes them look scarier and scarier, I want to run into the woods and never see a doctor again. There�s always some horrible trade-off, leastwise, for me; like take an anti-depressant to alleviate depressive symptoms (you know, to protect yourself from your own urges to kill yourself), and throw your circadian rhythm out the window, enjoy the shakes and paranoia as a result. What�s worse, the control or the disease?  I don�t think it matters, as my choices are limited. I will not willingly become suicidal again. I almost destroyed my family, a lot of my friendships, and my extended family looks on me as lazy and weak (They�re old school; they keep telling me to get off the dope.) 	I met a girl with similar problems on playsite.com; she said her major thing to deal with is that she knows she�s not going to be a fully functioning member of society. She�s never been able to keep a job longer than six months. This is an echo of me; I�ve never been able to hack working more than 4 months at a time, it takes too much out of me, and when I do a drug changeover, I�m usually out of commission for a few months. 	 It�s hard not to feel lazy and useless.  I do have a lot of things to be thankful for, my parents and my sister don�t always get how I�m feeling all the time (who does?) but they seem to have an infinite amount of understanding, and love for me. Kurt, well, Kurt�s amazing. He�s doing great in school, he�s always got a kind word or an ass-kicking for me. I�m not sure where I�d be at without him. I love them all so much. The animals that have chosen to spend some time with us are awesome. Lucas, my pride and joy, never leaves my side, even if he has to pee, he�ll hold it. Cordy hangs out with me when I�m waiting for some sort of bodily eruption in the bathroom, and the cats take turns licking my eyelids as I fall asleep.  Enough rambling. Time to stare at my ceiling, and hope for sleep.

      	Holy crap. My poo is green. I�m close to vomiting, and my head feels half again what it should weigh, and I�d swear I have a fever, but Kurt says I don�t. Ugh. I�m out of books; I�m going to start reading �I am Spock� again. Don�t laugh, it�s a good read. 	Still trying to figure out if I ought to tell supervisor Jim about my health predicament. Right now I�m hoping the extended amount of bed time and poo time will clear enough illness out of my system to do well tomorrow; I am going to another community and working with a new girl who sounds like she�s Miz Saleswoman. Hope she likes me. Hell, I hope I like her. I hope I don�t vomit or crap on her. Or Jim.  	Since I just jumped in on my current situation yesterday, thought I�d give some insight as to what sort of a meat popsicle I am.   Age: 24 Sex: Female Martial Status: Been married since July 16, 2002. Education: Two electives short of an undergraduate degree in Philosophy Favorite Color: blue Current Issues: Major Depression, drug withdrawal, stress about supporting my husband who is, bless him, bettering himself at the university deal. Weirdest Job: Psychic 	 I�ve got a couple of really great stories, about how kurt and I met, how I got through university barely, and family stories and so on. I�ll get to them, I think, but right now I�m using this blog to focus my hazy brain, and deal with this silly shit.  I think I better go back to sleep now.

      November 18/2002  	Right. So another useless day passes, and I haven�t done anything to make it less useless, unless one counts healing. I wish I did. But, even more, I wish I had have got up at ten this morning and went out, made sales, made Kurt and Jim proud. But instead I woke up on the edges of a nightmare, feverish, nauseated, with a spiked marching band in my head. So I slept; that being what I do best lately, sold no satellite systems. On the plus side, my withdrawal symptoms seem to be levelling off. My hands don�t shake, and I can now eat an entire bowl of porridge with no help from the dog. Yay me. Unfortunately, this does not directly help the financial situation. 	Here is the situation. Kurt and I are living in Atlantic Canada, he�s going to University, and I�m trying to support us. After two months of searching, I found a job selling satellite systems; I get paid solely by commission. We�re behind on our rent; approximately a month and a half. One month behind on car payment. Two months behind on our phone bill. 45 dollars below our Visa limit. Perhaps this does not come off as stressful as it is to me. The added thing is I have major depression, been fighting it with varying degrees of success for years, and I have trouble being in public.  Recently, I made the executive decision to come off my medication; to rid myself of an anti-psychotic that has been knocking me unconscious for a year. I was put on the pills to get rid of �impulsive tendencies�, although my tendencies were only two events. The doctors said since my three suicide attempts were largely unplanned, I would benefit from being on a drug that would help me relax, help me think things through. It was also to help me sleep; but like I said before, it was more of a being hit with a cast iron skillet without the head trauma. 20 minutes after I took the required dose, I couldn�t speak coherently, couldn�t remember things. The morning after, I could not remember things that happened, sometimes as far back as an hour before I took the meds. On several occasions, when trying to go to work in the morning, I would come close to getting into car accidents. It had to stop, and as of last week, I�m off the damn things. The withdrawal has been moderately awful, interfering with this job, my self worth, and my body. It has occurred to me, however, that I should not be experiencing withdrawal symptoms on medication my doctor prescribes me. 	I�m also on an anti depressant, of course. This drug, number six of tried anti-depressants, is working well. I haven�t tried, or thought seriously of killing myself. Sometimes I can even see that the mess I�m in is not as nearly as grave as I think it is.  	This illness, and even more so, the drugs I�ve been on to combat it, has been a major �I don�t know, upset? Block? Huge pain in my arse and the arses of people I love? Yeah. I had to leave school three times. I was supposed to graduate in 2000 from my undergrad, but I couldn�t do it. And I told no profs; so I really let myself down that way, I found out later there tends to be options for people like me. I know that now, but I had no idea then. Here�s my question. What about me now? Do I tell my boss I have this illness, this thing I see often as being a weakness? My boss�s boss? Do I suck it up, and do my best, even though I know there�s going to be days, weeks, and maybe even months and years like this? Is it an excuse for my laziness, or is it a reason? How about a reason to fire me? 	I keep thinking that maybe if I wasn�t like this, I�d be a good worker. I�d be a university graduate. I�d be, I don�t know, more, perhaps. Less scared. I know thinking like this is a trap. I can�t stop thinking like this. I am waiting for that other shoe to drop, and me trying to avoid that shoe dropping is a nail I�m going to step on barefoot.  	And, my God, there is a dramatic difference in everything when I sleep the entire night. I�ve slept about fourteen hours the last week. I�m sleeping longer lately, which is truly amazing, but it feels like my body is now catching up on all the sleep it�s missed the last few years. The unconsciousness that I put on myself with the anti psychotics was merely that; there was nothing restful about it. I wasn�t lulled into sleep, I was forced unconscious. In order to be the slightest bit functional, I had to have at least ten hours of this unconsciousness. My relatives think me lazy, and treat me as such. Sometimes I agree with them. I could not wake up unless someone had waked me; if there were no noises to wake me, I would continue sleeping; I think my longest stint like this was about twenty-four hours. At the time, I was living by myself, the dog had no inclination to go outside, and no one phoned or visited during that twenty four hour period. 	I should stop whining. There are so many people out there who have it worse than me. But I can�t seem to let it go, this stupid weird brokenness.

      One of my first memories is my great grandmother. She told me some stuff, most of which I don�t remember, except that she told me I was special, and something about the sight.  The next memory was of Grammy�s wake. It was before there was a wake house home, so the people were waked for three days in their own house. The dearly departed were not to be left alone for this period, and for some reason I forget, the mirrors were covered. Anyways, I remember Grammy lying in the casket, and one of the first things my Dad told me was to stay away from the stairs. No one was allowed upstairs, for any reason. So, my rebellious three year old ass attempts the stairs, steep stairs, had to climb up on all fours. Got to the second one and I was frozen to the spot, when I began to whimpered, I was released, and plunked down on my baby butt. Throughout my life, there was always something off about the house, no one wanted to go visit Uncle Paul, and weird stories surfaced. As space is limited in the family homesteads, and Paul�s was vacated, my sis, her boyfriend (Pikey) and me and Kurt bunked there. The theme of the stay was frustration. Sis and Kurt were at odds, Sis and Pikey were WAY at odds, and I was immensely frustrated with myself, I was forgetting things, my weak stomach was not allowing me to help clean up, the thought of the bathroom had me dry heaving, so on and so forth. Kurt became sullen and withdrawn, Sis was uberbitch, and I was looking for any excuse to get the heck outta dodge.  K, I admit, pretty innocuous so far. But the thing was, I know Kurt and sis better than pretty much anybody else, and they were not themselves. Sis, for example, is bitchy, but not in the particular way she was whilst there. And Kurt can get all sullen, but never self-pitying, never angry in the I�m-sixteen-I�m-Pissed-I�ll-Show-Them sort of way. And I�ve been depressed, oh my Lord have I been depressed, but I�ve never been the sort to run away, I�m definitely more of a �fuck it� sort, and stick it out. Know the poem about the guy whose head is bloody, but unbowed? That�s me, stubborn arse. So there was that. Then, there was the ghost poo. But I�m going to leave you hanging for a bit more, as I want to go over in my head the other events that transpired at the House.  As for right now, the Boss man wants me to sell 20 dishes. So far I sold one. I may be in trouble, but at least, today, I saw The Two Towers. Only nineteen more to go, right?    Also, the person that came up with brush on chocolate is a fricken genius.   That�s all for now, Happy New Year.   PS- Great to read your stuff, blogger newbies. Your best bet on posting sucessfully is to write it all in microsoft word, than pasting it rather than writing it all on the edit page.

      My Christmas Vacation   So, did I mention that I have really got a weak stomach? I think it�s an after-withdrawal recovery thing, but no matter. What is important is that I have a weak stomach, and Kurt is a shit connoisseur; he can tell type of animal, condition of said animal, and perhaps even what the animal has eaten all on the basis of a stool sample. These are the two important things to note when I explain a thing or three about Christmas this year. 	We were staying at Crazy Uncle Paul�s place. Paul has not, nor has ever been my uncle. He�s not crazy either, just pretty bizarre. He likes to scare people. He was pretty famous in my community for having a bunch of twenty something stoners always at his place. They�d get high, and Paul would fuck with them. He�d say stuff like he was the devil, that he controlled the weather. Explains a lot about me really; I have this tendency to lie to people I don�t respect, or when I�m really cranky. Not very nice, I admit. Once, I was in the airport with a doped-up Lucas, preparing for a six hour flight. I typically have Lucas� stripe in the middle of his head painted a color, purple or blue, but on this occasion, his stripe was pink. Prreeeeeetttyyy. It was five in the morning, and a stewardess asked me if Lucas had just had an operation. I told her that he was the first dog to be a recipient of a monkey brain. I AM A BITCH�she said �Really? He had a brain transplant?�   �No. Not really,� I bratted, and walked away.   Anyways, Paul is like this to a truly extraordinary degree. He�s the type of guy that, when you�re doing dishes, he�d stand behind you, really close, and not say anything. When you turn around, you�d get the living shit scared out of you.   Paul had one of these stoners hanging out with him a little more than the others. He had convinced himself that Paul was the devil. He stabbed Paul in the jugular. Paul, all 65 or so years of him walked the 45 meters to his brothers place, holding his hand to his neck, and his brother drove him to the hospital. Luckily, Paul had taken a month long respite from his alcoholism, and he lived. In the police statement, it was written that the stoner kid had whimpered �Oh no, he�s going to kill us all!� and vamoosed out of the house.   That�s the end of the digression, like I said, the important bits are that A) Kurt is a shit conniseur  and B) I have a weak stomach.   Oh, and the house is haunted, but tough shit, you�ll read about it tomorrow.

      The doctor was a short man with dead blue eyes, and he made no attempt to make me be a patient of his. It was a good meeting.  Going to go back home on Sunday, I think. Kurt�s a little bit worried that I�ll spontaneously combust or some such; the last time we went home, I had a meltdown. It�s wonderful there; the land, the friends, but every time I go home, I feel rootless, and that bothers me. No closure on the house I grew up in; it was sold and vacated, and moved in by new people all when I was in school. I never think it�ll be perfect, but I guess I always go home thinking it will be �relaxing�. The, my oversensitive ass will visit my grandmother, and I�ll become whingy.   Reading the Screwtape Letters, by C.S Lewis. It�s dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien, and on the first page there is a little blurb on the only way to beat the devil. Laughter is the key; the devil can�t handle mockery.  An excellent point, really. Shitty situations aren�t conducive to laughter, but damn, if you can muster some laughter up, you have that craptacular situation by the balls. One of the people I looked up to said that as well, the guy used o pick on me, and I�d try to pick back, and no go; he�d laugh at me. I learned this skill and applied it, I was virtually un-pickable for a while. It left, to a certain degree when I got sick, and everything became personal. Everything. The paint on the walls was a testament to how lame I was. My brain took everything my ears heard, and picked out the worst impossible interpretation. Oh well, I�m going to get that back. I�m not planning on becoming an insensitive ass, but my coping mechanisms have been shit for a few years, so a recapitulation is necessary.  I can�t wait to go  to the two towers!

        YESTERDAY  In a pretty maudlin mood lately, that�s why I haven�t been writing, I�d like to try to keep my whining at a minimum. But you know, I�m sitting here, listening to Sigur Ros, just after watching �It�s A Wonderful Life,� and I�m drifting off into sad sackness. Was thinking about my parents earlier, wondering if they�re okay. I talk to them, sure, but my parents are not the most vocal of people sometimes, especially when they think information they have may depress me. Understandable, but then I get to thinking about what sort of state their in, and my imagination is about 5 times worse than real life most days. Mom�s not putting up a tree this year, since I�m out, my sister is out, her boarder is out, and that leaves her and Dad. Usually, she has her friend and son over, but this year they�re Christmasing elsewhere. Mom and her brother are on the outs. So, pretty lonely time for them in the big bad city.  Landlord dropped by yesterday, we owe him a grand as of January first. Forget the other bills. Car insurance is up the 20th December, so I�m taking out a payday loan from money mart tomorrow.   I�m in sort of weird headspace right now. I want to go home, but at the same time, not. Home is where? No house where I  grew up in, my parents are provinces away, my extended family, oh sweet Jesus, my extended family- they made a large three hour production about how lazy I am  because I don�t match my socks. My grandmother greets me with either �You�ve gained weight.� Or, the more positive �You didn�t gain weight.� My sis is there, and three of my very dear friends, but the social niche I had there once is pretty shot. Nobody�s fault, stuff changes all the time, and I know I�ve not been the most charitable of friends. I completely lost patience with a friend I�ve has since adolescence. We have a longstanding disagreement. I think she�s an idiot. She thinks I�m an idiot. Somewhere along the way, our priorities changed. There�s a saying; your friends know your faults, and they like you anyway. Me and this girl (Let�s call her Cornflake Girl) got to that point where we saw each other�s faults, and couldn�t reconcile them anymore. I was too hurt, she was too henpecked by me, and there you go.  CG, however, is an integral part of the aforementioned social circle. There are three of us in this group. CG and I don�t get along. CG and Traveler don�t get along real well. And then there�s Closed Door. CD and CG get along all right, Traveler and CD are having troubles, and Traveler is also having the same sort of problem I had with CG. In other words, it�s sort of like an after-school drama gone horribly awry. And to be completely pragmatic, it�s a huge pain in the ass to go deal with.  But the ass pain is worth seeing Traveler, Sweetness, and Solace. Guess I�m just sick of things being one annoying slog after another. Ever notice how things seem heavier after a rough day, a bout of depression, or constipation? It�s like that, I think.  I know a few of you have been reading and thinking �Oh shit, she�s going to by a gun, and after killing everyone else that�s ever pissed her off, she�s going to turn the gun on herself� Not so. These articles are an excerpt, taken out of context. Don�t get me wrong, the feelings are real, but I�m not going to write about everything that happens, so that leaves out a lot of the good an indifferent stuff that happens during the run of the day. What ends up on these articles is stuff I can�t seem to shake off.  It�s easy for me, and unfortunate, that I forget the amazing sex I had this morning, the kid that I made faces with at the doctors office the other day, the most relieving pee I ever had yesterday, and petting the two adorable fat puppies in Ass End with Pink the other week.  Nah, that isn�t the stuff I end up thinking about at the end of the day. And it really should be, so, as a way to ease the minds of my Dear Avid Reader, I�ll put in one good thing I remember from the day I write. If there isn�t anything, I�ll put in a funny joke or website. Sound cool? All righty. I�ll start this tomorrow, or the next journal entry.     K, so since I didn�t get on last night to post, this is my next entry. In order to pay for insurance, I had to get a pay day loan, drove into Zee City, hung out with The Boy Named Sue for a while. Most of the day, actually. He�s going to ask his girl to marry him. Lucky girl, I thought, The Boy Named Sue is  an excellent catch. So, I spent many hours laughing my ass of at his jokes, drank green tea, it was nice. Nicer to come home to Kurt and the Zoo, though. I did not get the pay day loan, as I had out an out-of-province check, I haven�t been employed for six months, and I didn�t take a phone bill with me. These nuances would have been helpful on the phone, rather than driving 2 hours for little reason.  Boy named Sue, like many other people I know, wanted to get the skinny on being married.  I told him that it was the same as not being married, and living together, except it�s completely different. The difference is subtle, but all encompassing; like waking up one morning and seeing everything in color when you�re accoustmed to seeing in black and white. Your brain take a while to process it, and then, everything is new.  I go to the head shrinker tomorrow. I do not want to go, but it�s the right thing to do I suppose. Details to follow....

      We were promoted in the flea market world, instead of being banished to Siberia of the mall; we are now right by the front doors. The new view has a tantalizing glimpse of Tim Horton�s. Rockabilly Christmas music is tootling out of ceiling speakers and the last flea market of the season is not this week, as I anticipated, but next. There�s no way in hell I�m going next week. It was an act of supreme will to haul my ass out of bed this morning. 	Saw the movie �Blood: The Last Vampire� last night. It was one of those movies that qualify as an experience. Evidently, it took three years to produce, and worth every minute of production. I�m not a huge fan of anime, I�m pretty conservative, and stick with the mainstream anime releases. I always pick up on something inordinately alien about anime. I know the fact that it�s produced by a different culture and all that would account for this, but the alienness of it put me off a bit. With this movie that feeling was largely absent. There was, for example, no kinky cartoon on cartoon sex, and no creatures that were menacing, and somehow sexy at the same time. There were some pretty foul looking creatures, and there was the blood and gore associated with any vampire movie, but, as I said before, nothing alien. Reading this over, I realize that my complaint about anime is vague, and unsubstantial. Here�s an example though, that explains feelings and sensations close to how anime makes me feel; it�s like you�re leaning back in a chair, and suddenly, you get the impression you�re going to fall on the back of your head because you�ve been leaning too far back. As you scrabble around trying not to fall, reality reasserts itself, and you notice you�re in a rocking chair. Take these sense impressions, stretch them out for about and hour and a half, and you get the sense of exhilarating bewilderment that I have watching the-not-so mainstream anime. 	Anyways, �Blood� is a great movie. My only complaint is that it�s too short, it plays out like the first episode of a series. But in this complaint, there is a hope that it will become a series. I read some reviews of it, and the common complaint is that has too many loose ends. I like that about movies though, it makes a person think. (For the exact opposite- �Signs� EVERYTHING tied up perfectly in the end, and I really enjoyed that, too.) 	As for news and excitement, Kurt is finished with exams, and I�m almost done work for the vacation. And I just met a woman whose brother worked at the psychic line I worked at briefly. He is a numerology expert, and is absolutely dizzying with his accuracy. If you�re one of those folks that think that whole deal is full of hooey, contact me for the psychic line number, call it, and ask for Fredrick. You will never doubt again, just make sure you know your birthday, and what time of day you were born. 	I hate the term �psychic�. Intuitive is much, much better. I find people have this notion that we know the future, the lottery numbers, and so on and so forth. Personally, I haven�t met anyone like that. I was just about to write about what sort of gifts I have, but I�m pretty sure I can�t adequately describe them. I can say though, that sometimes, it�s a huge pain in the ass. Remind me to ramble on Disclosure sometime. 	5.22pm: Ate food, did NOOOO housework, and god damn it, I am sleeping in tomorrow. Sold two dishes at the flea market. It would have been three, but one asshole tried to open an account and it was in arrears, so no sale and a pain in my ass for me. Cordy has taken to climbing up on the backs of couches. Also, she likes to try to eat my hair. She�s a weird dog. 	And that�s it, loyal reader.

      Awoke at 4.30am, and for all intensive purposes, stayed awake. This was indeed most foul. Went back again to Ass End, minus Pink, and got one sale. Hairy is good company. Shared idiotic stories, made fun of people, each other, and so on. My impression of Supreme Boss Man was good, but I kept on wondering what his medic alert bracelet was for, and if he ever got it caught up in his arm hair. He was woolly mammoth hairy. Nice, seemed pretty flippant, and very carefully styled hair; it looked rather like he had separate the hair into clumps 5-9 hairs thick, gelled it, and carefully stood each clump on end in athesthetically pleasing porcupine quills. Why does Cordy get hiccups every three days?  I�m almost to tired to see, so buh bye for now.

       	Went to what felt like the Ass End of the Universe Wednesday, and walked the entire circumference of ass. Pink and me did the walking, and suffered the inevitable hip, foot and leg pain that followed. WHY are all port towns on a hill? I ask merely for information. Long story short: We came (7.00am-9.00am), we waited, (9.00am-11.00am) we walked, (11.00am-12.30pm, 12.30pm-4.30pm) we sucked. (All hours inclusive) Not a sale, not a person, not the remotest whiff of a possibility of talking to another human being. Pink complained endlessly, I sulked.  	Continuing my sulking vein, I pretended to sleep all the way home last night. Pink wailed on how the day�s work made us look bad, as we gained no sales, and Hairy gained five. I sulked. We got home, and two sales were waiting for me, pretty as you please. Sulking ceased. Went to sleep, woke up around five am, and stayed awake until approximately 9.30am. Fell asleep after I gained the knowledge that we were not returning to Ass End yesterday, talked to a client, and called tech support. Awoke around 1.30pm. Boss Man left three messages all in the tune of-you-never-call-me-back-you�ve-got-to-help-yourself and it�s-far-too-late-for-to be-in-bed. Called him back, explained my schedule, he hemmed and hawed, and there is the distinct possibility I�m on his shit list now. Went out to sell locally in the falling wet slushy snow around 2.30, came back at 4.30, no sale, one near-accident, and three people telling me the had a problem with our company, as the company put Its foot into their ass. Makes me wonder what my predecessors did to these trailer dwellers. No calls tonight, alas, and today; I�m back in Ass End, meeting Boss Man and Supreme Boss Man for breakfast tomorrow. The time of this meeting would be about 9am, so I must arise at the golden hour of 6.00am (It is 0600 hours. What does the 0 stand for? Oh my God, it�s early.) 	The need for meaningful employment is pressing down on my senses. It�s not like this job is torture, but its sheer meaningless makes me want to hork. I can�t get into funky salesgirl mode because, well, I suffer a profound amount of apathy when I consider the product. And the ambitions of my co-workers; to be Sales Rep of the Month, I find pretty laughable. I can�t seem to make myself take pride in the work I�m doing. Picky, Picky, you may be thinking. And, I suppose, you�d be right. However, as I consider the alternative of becoming all peachy with a big heaping side of keen on selling crap-in-a-box, I think, �Hey. Good. I�m not supposed to be all happy about being in retail for the rest of my life. This must mean something vaguely positive.� But, seriously, wouldn�t I be the luckiest carbon-based life form on the planet if sales were my thing? The love of my life? Wow-wee, would things be looking up in both the finances and the self-worth department. (And JP, self worth in this instance is tied in to being successful financially.) 	Go here:	  urlLink    You know what though? Yick. That thought appeals to me almost as much as having maggots for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the rest of my life, all 250 years of it. I�d rather be me, starving writer wannabe, beloved of Kurt, than a hunk-a-hunk-a burning sales rep with piles of money to roll around naked in. 	As for the water under the bridge thing, I�m going to be the mature person I know is lurking in here somewhere and not mention it to that psycho hose beast who besmirched my name. I�m going to sulk about it, probably write maudlin poetry about betrayal, then go have a nap. It�s not like the same thing hasn�t happened to me, you, the guy down the street, your neighbour�s dog, among others ten thousand times, right? No need to dwell, hold a grudge, use voodoo dolls, etc.   	Well, that�s it, that�s all. Off to Ass End I go, to sell dishes, and freeze my own ass end off.

      Hey hey kids,  Spent time with SB the other satellite guy, and since he is now number uno in the sales world, he is no longer SB. So, now I have to think of a new name for him. Perhaps Hairy, or Number 1. Working with him was awesome, is awesome, and I hope will stay fairly awesome. I guess it is his new attitude, and his willingness to make fun of me, himself, the world, etc. Him, Pink, and myself are off to a community an hour or so away, to spread the joy of satellite systems.   I am addicted to Age of Mythology, even though we just have the demo here at Casa Del Animala. So�if any of you Avid Readers want to get me a present, feel free to pick me up/burn/ steal a copy.  Still horribly behind on the rent, approximately 700 bucks. Forget about the phone, baby, no idea where that total is. Electric bill? Forget about it�.but I think, for the first time in a while, I�m okay about it. Talking to Boss man about my mental state, and his willingness to motivate me by pairing me up with people, sending all of us on these missions away, and, most importantly, his willingness to listen if I need to talk to him is really amazing (Although, I sort of doubt I�m going to be having any heart to heart conversations about me feeling like nut will happen much, if at all. It�s still comforting.)  Should water under the bridge remain so, even after new water is unearthed? Consider this a survey. To sum up, I found out new information, after a relationship had been mended. This information comes close to infuriating to me, mainly because I perceive a dip in opinion from a person I respect. So, should I let it go? Or should I do some confronting?    That�s it for now. Any suggestions for topics will be welcome.

      Another Sunday at the Flea market of lurrvveee. Well, no. The more appropriate title would be the flea market of Morning People, the flea market of  People Looking for Everything (including the kitchen sink, there�s a sweet little two-basin number across the way from us), or perhaps Flea Market For Those Who Have Nothing Better To Do On A Sunday Morning at 8am. I was thinking about the phenomena of morning people as we were driving here. I�m convinced they�re a different fricken species. Occasionally in my University days (or was it daze?) I�d shuffle into the Meal Hall at 7.30am, usually under duress. There were people there I had NEVER seen before. And on a campus of a thousand, that was interesting. The few other times I went I began to recognize them as those people who run at five am on a Saturday. I never see them at any other time of day, always between the hours of 5 to 8. Extraordinary, really. There�s an entire section of people who are up, awake, and astonishingly, engaging in PHYSICAL ACTIVITY! I wonder sometimes where these people go during normal hours. I suppose work, and school, the farm and suchlike. Maybe they fish. Or maybe, and this thought makes me feel better, they�re in bed.  It is now 10.11 in the am, and the place is crawling with fleas, erm, people. There�s a lady to the left of us selling Canadian geese with sprigs of a pine looking plant, and red berries coming out of its back. Charming.  Another chick is selling the toys that come free from Happy Meals, among various other assorted crap. I think she�s selling a bucket of loose legos. This is excitement. Truly.  Ok, well, I�m lying, the highlight of my day so far was a geriatric who had troubles with his remote, we discussed, and ascertained that his remote was killing batteries on him too fast.   I told the boss guy about being sick. He admitted that he didn�t understand what it was like, but he�ll help me out. He even said that he�d snap me out of it, which, hey, why not? Drugs haven�t worked, psychotherapy didn�t work, drugs and psychotherapy didn�t work, naturopathic medicine might have worked if I had have kept on the expensive diet and pills the guy had me on, perhaps it is a matter of selling satellites to sooth the soul. It reminds me of a story that Tom Robbins told in one of his books; I think it was Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates. Anyways, the story goes thusly; an Anthropologist goes to a small tribal community somewhere in the vast Third World. The natives liked him so much, they gave him a gift; Invisibility powder. The Anthropologist kept the powder on his mantelpiece; he never even tried it. The impression the author gave was that the guy was an idiot for not trying the powder. I�m inclined to agree. Sure, one could say that the powder probably wouldn�t work. But what if it did? It doesn�t make sense to me not to try a freely given miracle.   It is now 7.15pm. I cleaned the house, clipped puppy and dog nails, and now I�m here, and this is the extent of my excitement.

      Ever have the sort of day/week/month/year(s) where you feel like King Claudius? Let me refresh your memory. Claudius was the not-nice new king of Denmark, the cause of something rotten, as Hamlet always complained. Claudius killed his brother, married his sister-in-law, and alienated his new stepson, who hated him way before Daddy Spook came back and told him that Claudius slipped something poisonous in to the ex-king�s ear.   Why might someone feel like Claudius? Well, see, now, Hamlet is all bent on revenge, although he has a procrastination problem to get over. Hamlet sneaks up on Claudius as Claudius is praying. Hamlet thinks �Hey, can�t kill him now, if he�s sitting there repenting, I just bought him a ticket to Heaven, and we just can�t have that.� Thing is though, Claudius isn�t repenting. He�s on his knees, he�s asking for forgiveness, but in a real half-assed way; he doesn�t want to give up what he rightfully stolen. He feels bad for killing his brother, and stealing the kingdom, and what not, but he can�t feel truly repentant, since he really enjoys his current position.   The other day Kurt mentioned to me that it baffles him that I am in a job where, conceivably, I can make as much money as I want, and I don�t. Make as much money as I want, that is. Why?   I get discouraged quickly; I mean we�re talking faster than a speeding bullet. It takes two people to slam the door in my face to ruin my day. Or about three snotty hang ups when I�m calling. So there�s that. There�s also the sneaking suspicion that I�m selling something that does nothing for anybody, some people I sell to could use the money to buy their kids a haircut or some groceries. I�m right behind cigarette sellers, I�m not selling anything useful, nice, etc. Ignorance is bliss, so by that rationale, I guess you can say I�m making people happy, that is until they call me and complain that their remote is too complicated, the installer didn�t come when he said he would, satellite or no, there�s still nothing on TV. And another thing? I can go out all fricken day, get doors slammed, for eight hours straight, and not sell a single, blessed thing. I sit on my ass and make two phone calls, and boom; I sold two systems in 26 minutes.   Why don�t I go out there every single day and spend the full eight hours freezing my ass off and then go home and call for a few more hours? Why do I ask Kurt to come with me, drive me over to subdivisions, and come in with me to help me close a sale? I mean, I know part of it has to do with the fact that I can�t function properly on 3 hours sleep and half a day crying. I know that bit, but then there�s the other bit, the deep seated thought that I am lazy, because I don�t give a rat�s ass about how many dishes I sell so long as I sell some, and I don�t care how much money I make as long as we�re not starving to death.  I haven�t even got my shit together enough to bring my resume down to the bakery.  How does this tie in to Claudius? I have been doing stupid things, and although I�m sorry for them, I�m not doing much to make amends. To sum up, I give up too easily, I look to Kurt for support much more often than I should, I let myself get sad over this and other stupid things, further impeding my progress as a good salesperson, and I feel that selling dishes to a lot of people who could be using their money for something productive (yeah, I know I�m being a self righteous pig, but damn, there are more things important than 266 channels in digital, right? Anybody? Like making sure you don�t have lice and passing it along to some traveling sales rep�)  The landlady came in and asked why our apartment stank today. She happened to be standing by the kitty litter, but for some reason, I not only take personal offence at the remark, but also started to worry about the possibility of her and he husband deciding out we get because of our animals. (Right now we�re at three, Einstein is on the missing list for the last three days, we have our lovely fat Fida, Lucas, and Cordy, who the landlady thinks we�re fostering, when in truth, we�re pretty sure that Cordy would die, then I would if we were to part with her. She�s a pain in the ass, but I know what happens to dogs that aren�t puppies in the SPCA, and she makes up for all of her faults; not to mention her faults are improving.)  It seems to me when I have something to rely on; Kurt, my parents, etc, I rely on them too much. I think I have to not rely on them in order to keep myself going, but then I end up collapsing, and have to rely on them anyways.  And Kurt told me that his coming to school was a mistake. He�s probably right, but at the same time, I wonder if there ever would have been a good and right time for him to go to school. I sort of think excuses would happen, and he�d never go, and he�d be lost to what he truly excels at. But I also know that I�m not sure I have the ability to support us; I mean, I�m doing a pretty shitty job so far, and as soon as I really, really go the distance, I end up on my face.

       Met my new partner in the Biz, she�s awesome. She�s twenty, wears too much makeup, has beautiful blond hair, has higher blood pressure than her 55 year old dad, sarcastic, witty, and ambitious. Wow. She has her own car. She parties on the weekends, but not during the week. She gets laryngitis five times a year. She�s really cool, a definite improvement over Sad Bastard. SB is interested in hockey, getting drunk, and generally spends his time moping about his sales stats. He had the effect of making me feel guilty every time I made a sale. I noticed I�m susceptible to other people�s moods, so, being with SB didn�t help me in any way, shape, or form. This new girl, let�s call her Pink, has this amazing balance between wanting to sell a lot of dishes, and not letting the garbage part bother her. (Already, SB tried to make her look bad by telling the rest of us that she was a big bullshitter. This might have some thing to do with the fact that she already sold in one week more than he did his first month.)  Yesterday was spent with Pink, getting lost, and looking for a subdivision or a trailer park; somewhere we didn�t have to walk all that far to get from place to place. It was basically a pooch of a day, since neither of us knew the area we were trying to cover. Today, there was a fairly annoying amount of snow, so I turned to the phoning aspect of the job, and may just go out this evening, depending on how some call backs go.  Kurt is off visiting with his new mentor, the University Chaplain. The UC is the guy that set us up with the free food, and he is truly an amazing fellow. When I look at a picture of the Dalai Lama, or the current Pope, I always smile. They look genuinely happy and peaceful. The UC gives off this impression as well, only it�s a little more powerful because he�s live and in color, as opposed to a glossy print. It really does seem to me that this time in this town, I�m finally carving a niche. I felt pretty groundless when I went to school here, nothing made sense, I had no goals, I felt like a stranger. This time around I�m more comfortable. My goals are modest (keep apartment, keep the family fed, try to maintain saneness, get published) but they�re actual goals, not just vague ideas.

      Good morning,  This is actually instalment two of the day, alas, first post was lost. Usually, I write the whole thing in Word, then paste it into Blogger. I broke with tradition today, and paid the price, words were lost. Bloody hell. Well, not like there was anything stunning on the first post, but jeez�  Went to the market of fleas yesterday. There were no spittling patrons, no loudmouths, and happily sold four dishes. Kurt made a killing on the cards, as well, so we actually came out of it on top, rather than a few bucks in a the hole, as such is often the case.  I think I�m getting better, leastwise my endurance is going up. Yesterday I plummeted after all the salient items were done, I was able to eat a little more than usual. I still fee like liquid hell is sloshing around my cranial cavity, and only Zod knows what�s lurking in the digestive tract, but my capacity to deal has increased.   Yup yup. If anything exciting happens today, I�ll be sure to write about it.

      A year ago I was a nanny in the City. There were two children, a seven year old and a five year old. They played Grand Theft Auto on the playstation. The youngest kid refused to use  "I", it was "Me want this, Me no like that." The older kid tried to go home with his friends when I came to pick him up at school. The daddy of the the kids put the moves on me, and the mom paid me once, for two days, although I worked for her for close to two months, 12 hours a day. Went to the Labour Board about wages not paid, and it looks like they're going to close my case, because they moved. A lot. At night. With a lot of unpaid bills. For example, they owe a day-care center tab of about four grand. They owe me about 1200, and it looks like I'm not going to see it, unless I can come up with where they're at before April. Bloody hell.  In other news, might go back to busking to bring in some extra dough, but have fallen short of putting up the posters. The vim is gone, the desire to peddle the trade is gone. Need the cash, though, but I wonder if I still have the skill necessary to busk.  Blegghhhh. I'm in a funk. Funky funkmeister of the funky planet funkfunkfunk. Haven't been writing.. Whaton earth do i write about?  Ugh. I'm going to take a bath.

      Go here:  urlLink    This is to pre-empt yet another stupid internet rumor that's probably going to gain in popularity in the weeks to come. I'm not even going to dignify this piece of crappy reporting by quoting it here. The link is to my favorite advice columnist, Dan Savage. Dan is as queer as a three dollar bill, pulls no punches when offering sexual advice to the masses, and is a generally entertaining read. Of course, this issue is begging me to get on the subject of sexual orientation, so excuse me while i indulge myself on a rant here: I've come across a lot of gay folks in my day. A lot. University is the prime place to be questioning one's sexuality, along with everything else. University students have a tendancy to question everything; to try and figure out where they fit. Understandable, but common sense should come up and rattle these people a bit. I truly wholeheartedly believe that one's sexual orientation is NOT a choice, but there are a lot of fucked-up post teens who give it a go in the university scene. In this morass of stupid descisions, there are the folks who feel they just have to stand up and face the music, who have to admit that they are, in fact, gay, and that they're trying to get on wit their lives the best way they can. Good for them. My beef is the promiscuity issue. Promiscuity is wrong, and it's going to hurt people. A few of my guy friends who came out became sluts. There isn't a thing called safe sex, you're putting a piece of latex or sheepskin or whatever between yourself and a disease that will not only kill you, but probably make a lot of other people sick before you even realise you have it, and you're spreading it around.    Promiscuity is everywhere, not just in the gay side of things. Sex is used as a weapon, for power, for everything. I could have sold a lot more dishes with just the hint of sex, showing off my body, being flirtatious. Back home in Hick City, a guy's status is greatly elevated according to how many girls he's been with. (This only goes one way, girls are not cool by having multiple partners.) I had shocked and amazed people by stating that I would not date a particular fellow because he had been with too many girls. In university, a lot less had changed than I would have liked. Jocks at my school were supplied with bunnies who wanted them. The more bunnies they had, the more bunnies wanted them.  I'm of the mind that homosexuality, in and of itself is no more evil than any other thing. We're all sinners, right? It's the choices one makes that make it evil, or not. Be gay, be straight, be whatever your little heart desires, but be monogamous.

      Fida is sans uterus, and I just took one in the ass to refain from pregnancy; feels like I've been hit with something large and heavy. I can't help but wonder, since my attention has been put to all manner of things reproductive, why is it that the female of our species gets new and unique forms of mild torture known as birth control? I ask merely for information, I'm not overtly bitter or anything. But my common sense tells me "Hey. Boys' plumbing and chemistry is a lot easier to manage, so why not manage birth control?" Right now is probably not the best time to be speculating as my ass hurts, the drug is working though my system like a toxic molasses...on the upside NO PERIODS. None. Ingenius. Swelling, pain and dripping like a faucet is not a terrifc way to spend eight or so days a month. There's just no need.  Anyways. Mostly ignored the superbowl yesterday. I mean, I probably would have paid more attention if the first three quarters didn't suck, but there you go. I wanted good ol' Jerry Rice to be the only player to win three superboals on three seperate teams, but alas, poor Jerry, your team's heads were firmly stuck in the astro turf.  Age Of Mythology has a huge hold over my psyche. That game is more addictive than crack. I even dream about all my little Greeks running around, getting resources.   Sending mojo did not work for Chad. Miss Complicated accepted a written invitation to go to a romantic resturant, and then, at the end of the night, told Chad that his expectations were too high, and that he was putting undue pressure on her. I assume she accepted the invitation, (complete with romantic quasi-poem) to gain a free meal, the silly bint.   I saw, at the vet's today, that a dog named Bear needs a home. She's small, an exotic aussieshepard crossed with something equally exciting, and she's going to be 2 in Feburary. What do I do? (Besides, of course, hunt down and kill the bastard who hit her.) I  feel like I don't deserve any pets after what happened with Cordy. (Lucas isn't a pet, he's my first husband.) Fida I watch and worry over as if she's my kid, and she's got a terminal case. Would it be good for us to get another dog? Would it be, more importantly, good for Bear to come here and live with us?  Ok. Off I go, to build and destroy things.

      Went to  a friend, Granger's birthday party last night, and hada great time.   This is a peculiar state of affairs, as I normally don't being in public in general and bars in particular. But thanks to amazing company, and a moderate amount of beer, a good time was definitely had. And Granger is definitely Miz Popularity, she seemed very happy that her friends were around.   Landlord dropped by today, fixed the lock on the door, and informed us that the fuck downstairs is moving soon. Good for us, good for the neighbourhood kitties, this guy's a kicker. His wife seems fabulous, but I was too afraid to get to know her.   Much mojo goes to Chad today, as he makes another attempt at being with a girl he loves but is a huge pain in the ass. She's a smoker that's into natural healing, and yeah, that's basically how she is about everything, it seems. Complicated.   Found out what type of writer i want to be. I read a bit of WP Kinsella, and that's it. That's what i want, to bring magic into the every day, to invoke a sense of wonder about the world. WP brought us the only Kevin Costner movie I ever liked; "Field of Dreams". I'm not a baseball fan, and I think Kevin ought to be tied up and smacked with VHS copies of all the movies he's ever made, "waterworld' is worth five hits, same goes with 'the postman'. Ugh. That guy acts with all the passion of a phone book. Anyways, it's based on a short story called "Shoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa'. Read that, and  a few others, and Mr. Kinsella is my new favorite author, ousting John Irving.  All right, so this blog entry sucks ass. But I'm back.

      I got a job, unfortunately, it begins in March, three kids, all roughly of school age, they're  the intospective type,  also big on building and destroying things. Tomorrow, I eat lunch with the boys and their parents as a sort of orientation thing. I'm not looking forward to it, not because of the kids, or the drive, but Cordy.  I know life should continue, and will continue, whether I want it to or not,and maybe, according to some lifeless, souless bastards, a person can think about this obejectively and say 'Hey, it's only a dog," but I am emphatically not one of those people, and the profound lack of Cordy is a weight, a tear on my insides, and an ache on my head and heart. She was much too alive to be dead. I keep on thinking about whether or not she was in pain, whether she knew we were with her, if she was scared, I worry about that a lot, about many deaths; I think there can't be anything worse than dying scared. And, I keep wondering if things were Enough, did we do enough for her? Surely she didn't live enough. Did she eat enough, was she happy enough? Were we good enough for her? To her?  I know she would have been a water dog. She would have jumped with reckless abandon into streams and lakes; she would have jumped all over us with her damp lean body. She would have done many things, and I simply can not express how much I miss her, how much I want to see her ears finally stand up, to see her get another pre-growth spurt fat belly. So many things.  I sort of think that if I get over this, it will mean that I'm not sorry anymore, that I am not admitting my negligence. I know, deep down, that this is a lie, and it's virtually impossible to entirely get over something the way I feel I will, and, also, it's  utterly impossible for time to stop. Because of time, everything passes.   It is possible that i may stop writing new blogs for a while. Until this is over. If that's going to happen, I'm going to put pieces of crap I've been writing the last while on, so that way, you all know I've not found something sharp. (seriously, no threat, no worry of me damaging myself, there's no way i could do that to my family, and to kurt, so please, no concerned phone calls.)  Do you think she would have traded her life with us for something longer?

      Cordy   September 11, 2002 � January 17, 2003   She died about an hour ago. We had been training her to go outside unattended, but today Kurt had caught her on the road. Neither of us was paying attention when it happened; even after yelling at her about it today. The fucks that hit her didn�t stop. I think she was struck in the head. It�s funny, all those years of pre-hospital care, I was trained not to move a victim, but it wasn�t her spine that was the problem. Her eyes didn�t track when we got her inside. I kept thinking that we never took a picture of her. Not one.  She was a terror, Cordy was. She gave us fleas, she peed in our bed, she ate underwear, and she ate George, my bear who was dressed as an engineer, who sat with his arms in a loop around his knees. She ate his nose first, of course, and followed up with his eyes. She had a thing for chewing tacks, and if the ghost poo story is not to be believed, she had heroic sized bowels. She loved the shower; she�d try to get into it whenever some one was in there, sometimes, however, she was content to squint as the spray from the shower hit her in the face.  She was goofy looking, beautiful, and occasionally, one of her ears would make an attempt to stand up straight. This month, she finally grew into her head. There�s so much more to write about her, really, but I can�t.    She tried to beat up the shop vac, cats were her best friends. Lucas even liked her, eventually.  We both miss her so much already, we hardly know what to do with ourselves.

      Damn it.  That job, the one i was excited about, the one i asked for mojo to get is not an option. In order to get this job, a person has to be in receipt of EI benefits in the last 5 years. I've never been on pogey, so this disqualifies me immediately. The sad and horrid thing is that this is a trap. It's designed to be part of a program that gets folks off EI. However, the job placement lasts a mere 48 weeks, and those 48 weeks are not insurable; meaning that those weeks cannot be counted towards future EI benefits.   So, my word of the day is FUCK. Also, I called Mr. Freake's office. I am one of eighty applicants.   BUT, i do have a job interview as a nanny on Thursday at 4.00pm. It's minimum wage, which is about 6 bucks here, but it's also 40 hours a week, it's kids, and hey, it may be all right. Also, the lady from the Real Good Job wants to meet me anyways, so something may happen with that yet.

      The cat, Fida, goes haywire every night at about three fifteen. She tears around the house, tries to open up doors, and generally makes as much noise as felinely possible. i know this because not only has she woken me up, but the last few days, three am is when I got up.   My big plan for the week is to make a huge pot of stew for some superfriends that live about. I'm still in job limbo, sometimes paralysed with fear that I'm not going to get a job, as matter of fact, the thought has crossed my mind that Kurt and the animals and I will be living out of the civic come march. Oy.  I want that assistant job so badly I can taste it. I went to the church monday to show my face, and meet some salient people. Unfortunately, the person will be hired by a board, (2 by 4) so there was no one to introduce myself to. I'm phoning today to find out if The Powers That Be got my application ok. Please send much mojo, good vibes, prayers, and all that my way, I need this job, and I'd be GOOD at it. (Namely, I'd be doing research on the internet to find ways to fund charity programs, and being the plan co-ordinator's lackey.) Also, if there are any ideas on how to get this job, any little hints, let me know.  Also applied to be an admin assistant to an accountant. The man's name is unfortunate: Ian A. Freake. Mr. Freake. You've got to like that.   I haven't written a single solitary creative thing since...since...wow. A long time. Last thing I was working on I shut down because it was about Kali, and me being the ignorant fark that i am, didn't realise that kali worship is alive and well. Sure, i could modify it comepletely, but I've not had the engine to do anything of the sort in a long while. Then, there was a kid's story about a little girl who wants to be a fly on the wall, but again, the creative juices have slowed and thickened. Could be a winter thing, I suppose.

                   Woke up about an hour ago, I think sleeping is righting itself in a proper way, slowly, but it's happening. I woke up after a dream I had about the ocean. I'm always dreaming about the ocean, lots of different ocean themes cross over my sleepy mind. This one, a set of large waves were coming in, and an extremely foolish woman was trying to ride her horse out into the surf. The swells were increasing, the horse would drown soon, I knew. I swam up to her, and tried to talk her out of what she was planning. She couldn't hear me, and in the fashion of many of my dreams, I talked to the horse. I told it how to swim under the waves as they crash, how it's important not to panic, and I told it I would go with it where ever it went, to help it swim. The horse got me to cover its nostrils as a wave began to break, it told me how hard it was to carry the foolish woman. The horse and I formulated a plan, it swam along the shoreline, rembering to duck under as the waves came, and to wait for them to pass before emerging for a breath. I swam alongside, out of sight from the rider, and timed it so when a wave was just about to crash over top of the horse and rider, I surfed it, and grabbed the rider, and pulled her off the horse, using the force of the ocean to acomplish this. The horse, now riderless, made its way inshore. As the rider and I got pulled into shore, I punched her in the face a few times, my dream self remembering Kurt telling me how a knockout is really only a case of whiplash. I knocked her out, pulled her away from the surf. The horse was standing on top of a dune, and I took off its bridle, halter, saddle. It galloped away, assuring me it would never get caught again. I turned back to the ocean to see the waves growing in size, and lessening in frequency. Perfect, thought my dream self, and I went back in to surf the waves.  It's peculiar. I feel I should be angry about something. I'm not exactly one to get angry, I get annoyed, and it's safe to say I get annoyed frequently, and in this state I'm most verbose about what exactly it is that's annoying me. But anger is something completely different, something one should be serious about, and life is much too important to be taken seriously. But right now, I feel I should be angry about something, there should be a righteous ire building in me, but it seems to me I must have forgotten what it was I was supposed to be angry about. I suppose I'm angry with the Rider from my dream, I'm angry at Garp for not being more understanding towards Helen in the book I'm reading. I keep on thinking about conversations Kurt and I have about where women stand in society (It's far worse than most would even suspect, and the scary thing is that it's practically invisible). I am angry at the fact that women are rarely taken as authorities on anything, how an assertive woman is a bitch, an open woman needy, and how, two years ago, a white, upper middle class woman, complained to the class i was in that she was being oppressed because there were too many men in her electrian's class, and she had to 'settle' for University. (wear a burqua, bitch, then talk to me about being oppressed. Don't get me wrong, women are not on par with men anywhere on this flavored little planet, but opression is not the proper term to use when talking about too many men in one place.)  But this anger is cerebral, distant and off to the side. I feel, oddly enough, that is should be closer to me, I should take the plight of the poor, women, and the other injustices to heart and become passionate with anger, and jump up and do something about the State of Things. I won't though. The more pragmatic side says that life does, in fact, suck, and getting angry does nothing. Nothing. It's a useless emotion, in and of itself, and there are many ways one can make their own corner of the world better. Feeling a duty to help people out, to be compassionate, I think that's the better way to go about things. Getting angry and distributing leaflets and other things will not change matters. Helping your neighbour out does. In a tiny way, of course, but everything's made up of tiny things, right?

      And so i got this e-mail today from zee Boss:  Robyn   It has been 11 days since you have been back and have yet to return any calls of mine. I'm sorry but I think its time to move on and find someone else that wants the job that will be able to sell everyday. I have called you at least 7 times in the new year and have not heard from you at all.   I was a patient as possible and tried in everyway to help you along, I hope that you will find something that will be better for you.   Boss Man   Ok...had i got this a week ago, or for that matter, yesterday, I would have been devestated. (If it had have been the last few days, I probably would yammied all over the keyboard.) I mean, it's not snotty, but i definitely felt like i threw it all away. Not now. I feel like i made the right choice, underlined by the feeling of whoo i'm free...Freeeeeeeeeee..free to run down to the Baptist church the next town over and explain to them thatI would love to be a an adminstrative assistant to the Family Resource center. (I really would!) Of course, my dear Avid Reader, you may be thinking I'm off my gourd. Not so. The bills are taken care of till about Feburary. So, i have time. I hope it's enough time. I am aware it was perhaps idiotic to leave one job without having another one to run to, but it was to the point where i could not physically go to work. Nausea, wanting to drive the car off something or into something, a plethora of ill feelings and fears, not to mention my penchant for focusing on the negative; all of these things aided me in that helpless horrid feeling of my sanity unraveling. And, I feel I'm just putting my trust out There, and that makes me feel ok. Weird, right? I did a stupid thing, and I feel ok, becuase I'm trusting that I can find a better job, that i can do better then selling dishes. And I can do it before the safety net goes out. So, send mojo and happy thoughts my way.

      This is a graphic article. Be aware.  My sleep schedule is still cockeyed, but a couple days ago, I did the dishes, shampooed the carpet, vacuumed, did the laundry, and made supper. I was feeling more or less on the ball. Suddenly, I vomited supper, and spent the rest of the night and most of the morning puking. After that stopped, the muscle aches and the general feeling of �hoo boy, am I siiiiicccck� took over. And here I am, nauseated, ate three chocolate chip waffles very, very slowly, and that has been my sustenance for the last 72 hours. This morning, I was not able to keep down water. But, that was ok, when I puke water, it just takes like water; hardly any stomach acid gets in. My dad used to recommend eating bananas when I had the stomach flu, because �The taste as good coming up as they do going down.� This, by the way, is not entirely true, but if you have to eat something in between visits to the toilet, banana is pretty easy to handle, unlike tuna cassaerole. I don�t  think I�ll be able to eat that again for a long, long time.  So, I found out today, I haven�t been fired, not yet. I have to tell boss man my intentions today. Might still get fired, I suppose, but it�s nice to know I have a chance, if I need it, to keep my job. I hate it. I�ve listed the reasons why, but I need a job.   And then, I thought. Fuck it, Fuck boss man, and fuck everything to do with the company. I want to work for a non-PROFIT organisation. Lo and Behold, I found something; an ad to become an �administrative assistant� at a local family resource center. I�m getting this job.

      Boss, Here's the thing, I've been out of commsion since i got back from home. I flipped my sleep schedule over, so i can't sleep at night, and i've been nausated. Anyways, that's not an excuse, it's a reason. I'm doing the best I can, and I would like to continue to work for you. Thanks.  robyn   So, i can't summon the cajones to either call Boss man, or to face him in person. This email, is not a lie, not exactly. It is a lie of omission. The reason I've been ill IS the job. I omitted that I hate my job, want out of the job so badly i can almost taste it, and would rather be shovelling rhino poop than working for him. The company billed me for 135 extra dollars, they took it out of my account, and I can't get that back into my account, but they can credit me.   Kurt's back in classes,and I'm hoping to win the hearts and minds of the good people at the town office. The powers of the town are putting together a program where folks can help out younger kids by helping them into the workforce. It even includes drving them to places. I would like this job because the pay is steady, it sounds at LEAST passingly meaningful, and I would really, really like to be involved in something that could help another body out. It's right in Wolfville, and one uses the company car. I'm actually worried about getting my hopes up, seems whenever I do things don't work out. Send mojo for me, kids, I need a job that won't lead me to homicide.  A few days ago, I noticed the apartment is slightly barren. I got drawing stuff today, I'm hoping that will change some things.

      I have writer�s block, or so it would seem. Here is a transcript of the most exciting thing that happened today. Mollusk was my msn name of the day, the Angry Mallard is Jace, the guy that guest spotted here, and has his own damn blog, of which you can read if you go here:  ragingquack.blogspot.com  The Angry Mallard says: robynism! Mollusk says: g'day..  The Angry Mallard says: wussup? Mollusk says: writer's block, cried durning futurama, don't want to talk to my boss The Angry Mallard says: cried? Mollusk says: besides that, okey dokey Mollusk says: YUP.. sad, eh? Mollusk says: did you see it today? The Angry Mallard says: what about The Angry Mallard says: nope Mollusk says: Well, Frye's dog was found, and it was encased in something or other, so he was going to bring the dog back to life. The Angry Mallard says: uhhuh Mollusk says: finds out that the dog has lived 12 years after he was frozen... Mollusk says: so he decided not to bring him back to life because it was likely the dog forgot all about him. Mollusk says: Then, it goes to a scene where you see what happened to the dog for those twelve years Mollusk says: the dog waits there.  Mollusk says: and waits, and waits. Mollusk says: and dies Mollusk says: so, i cried. The Angry Mallard says: (insert crying smiley graphic here)      That�s it, seriously, the most interesting thing was that I talked to Jacen, and I discovered that I have a very soft heart (or head, perhaps?) I do have somewhat of a track record regarding movies. I cried during the original black and white production of �The Hunchback of Notre Dame�, as my Dad will attest. I was furious with that gypsy strumpet running of with Blond guy, when it was the hunchback who loved her, and who had saved her life. I was five at the time, and remember balling my fists, and biting my lip, and realizing that life sucks, better get a helmet. (K maybe not that last bit, I was five, after all.) After that, I never cried during a movie until �The Green Mile�.  I don�t think I ever cried during a TV show. Can�t say that anymore I guess. I thought the reason was chemical at first, since, hey, I might�ve skipped a pill, and, in the past, I was typically emotional the night before the first day of my period. However, I�ve not had a period in six months or so, and I didn�t skip the daily dose. So, I guess I�m a softie.  So, I�m reading �Skinny Legs and All� by Tom Robbins. Sometimes, I truly enjoy his work. Other times I want to beat him senseless. Flowery language surrounding bullshit ideas, but there�s just enough compelling, interesting stuff to make me like him, the jerk. Also, he�s a research based writer, which I long to be.   An example of this flowery bullshittyness was a bit I read last night. The gist was that folks who spend too much of their energies on the pursuit of Heaven will put the world through hell. For example, who cares about the environment, suffering of people, etc, when you have a notion that you�re going to Heaven? Consequences be damned; we�re just here for the trial. Real life begins after death.  I agree, to a certain extent, that too much emphasis on Heaven, and more secularly, the future, is a nasty ass place to be. It�s difficult for us, sure, because we can�t even experience the present, because the present is always slipping through our fingers at a steady rate. But, what the fuck Tom? Aren�t YOU sort of pining away at something, sort of like our friends who think too much about the afterlife? Basically, he�s saying things would be better IF. The Heaven/Future oriented are saying the same . Things would be better if we were dead, or older, or richer, or smarter, or skinner, or fatter, or if we didn�t think about the future so much. I guess what I took out of it is that one has to be mindful of right now, what�s going on. I think entirely disregarding the future is just as dangerous. The middle path is advised, which is sort of funny, Gotama Buddha said that something like for thousand years ago. Level headed guy, that.  I am going to work for the Evil today. Really. This is my plan, anyways. Of course, my sleep patterns are back to nocturnal, I hate my job, the boss, and everything else, and I have two visits to make for new potential employers. Right.  And for the daily does of positivity : There is a LOT of snow on the ground, and it is beautiful. Also, Magic is awesome.   Dorks rule.

      This is a version of the chad-sex-in-the-office story.	  The Confession  I�m always in the office in the afternoon. Pat, my advisor, was usually out, so it�s the best time to get work done. The creepy exchange down the hall, Juanita, is two offices down. She always sits in the dark, walking into her office is like walking into a cave. Nonetheless, into the cave I go, since she left me a note to see her in the faculty mailbox this morning. Probably wants to talk about my thesis. Almost every prof has, at some time, or another, wanted to talk to me about the thesis. It�s the first time that the Department has allowed for a thesis in English to be a creative project. 	So into the cave I go. She appears to be meditating, or napping. I knock on her door, she gestures for me to sit down. In my head, I go over what I had written so far on my thesis, about playing hockey, missing my ride because of drugs, the standoff I had with mom about the drugs. Right now, I�m writing about how my mom locked me in the basement to get me clean. So, I�m sort of grinning when I sit down, in part because of Juanita�s imperious gesture, but largely remembering how much my mom loved me to lock me in that basement, while I was screaming obscenities. 	I sit, waiting for her to start. Juanita sighs, flips back her long brown hair. She sighs again, and adjusts her glasses. I can�t help but think how weird she is, sitting in her cave, and not actually speaking to me. 	�You know, Charles, there have been a number of sexual assaults on campus the past through months.� My brain brings up solid. She has an accent, she�s from Venezuela, or somewhere else warm and Spanish speaking. Maybe I misheard.	 	�What?� 	�Sexual assaults.� She sighs again, leans back. Okay. I understood what she said. Why is she saying it to me? 	�I�m sorry, Juanita, but what are we discussing here? I thought we were going to discuss my thesis,� My mouth is quite dry, and my brain, after slamming into that mental wall, is scrabbling to make sense out of what she�s saying. 	�Well, Charles, I wish we could talk about your thesis, but this is far more serious. I see a girl hanging around the office with you sometimes, yes?� A girl. A girl. A girl. Jocelyn  works out of town, she never comes to see me at the office. She calls, to find out what we�re doing that evening. Classmates. A girl. Then it hits me.  	�A short girl, short blond hair? Reece?� 	�Yes, that would be her. I do not know her name.� 	�Yes, well, what about her? Wait a minute. What is being implied here?� 	�Charles, I spend many hours in this office, often late at night. I would prefer it if you did not bring girls to your office to have sex with them.� She�s leaning forward now. I�m trying really hard not to laugh, or puke on her desk. 	�What?� I say eloquently. It�s like what I hear about looking into the Grand Canyon, at first, a person�s brain is unable to process it, it�s too damn deep. This was difficult to process because it was too damn insane. 	�Why are you surprise Charles?� 	�Juanita, I am not having sex in my office. Or are you saying I assaulted her? What are you trying to say? She�s not even my girlfriend,� She raises a hand. 	�It is none of my business. I do find it unprofessional, however.� 	� Wait a minute. Wait one minute. Reece is my best friend. We play video games here. No sex. I have a fianc�e, and we live together.� She�s getting a bit uncomfortable now, probably has to do with the fact that I�m bewildered, and the bewilderment is making me sound high pitched and crazy. 	�Whatever you say, Charles. Just keep what I say in mind.� I stand up, walk out of her cave, hitting the doorframe with my shoulder on the way out. Then I call Reece, and tell her everything. The same crazy I heard in me, I heard in her. 	�Chazz, you can�t be serious? What the hell? Oh my God, Chazz, could this affect getting into grad schools next year?� 	I sigh. �I hadn�t even thought about that. But if Juanita goes to the head of the department, yeah, this could mean something bad.� 	�All right, fine. I�m going to see her tomorrow.� The next day passes, with me getting chills every time I pass that creepy woman�s office. At 4pm, almost on the nose, Reece walks in. She�s carrying a case of beer.  	�Drinks on me, lover boy.� Despite the tone, she looks nervous. Weirded out. 	�Don�t screw with me, what happened?� She grinned, sort of tightly around the corners. �I told her everything. She was taken pretty far aback. I started in on the whole if-she-thought-i-was-being-assaulted-why-the-hell-didn�t-she-call-security thing. She said she was going to, but she was worried about embarrassing us. Embarrassment! Can you imagine?� 	�It would have cleared things up pretty quick if she had.� 	�No kidding. But, it�s over now, anyways.� She�s not looking at me, and she�s looking sort of tense. 	�How?� 	�Like is said, Chazz, I told her everything. I told her that I was worried about your career, that we were playing video games, that nighttime is the best time to do that so we aren�t pissing anyone off. The last thing was the kicker.� She blushed. Reece is not the blushing type, but then again, we really don�t talk about much that would have that potential. 	� And I told her that I was a virgin, and had an appointment to see the doctor this evening to find out if there�s any tests, or whatever I could take to prove it. She got pretty uncomfortable, then, and told me that wouldn�t be necessary. I, uh, well. Here�s some beer.� 	She left then. I was too stunned to give chase. She didn�t answer her phone the next day, but Juanita cornered me in the printing room.   	�You have a very good friend. Not to worry about it, okay? It was my mistake.� I just smiled and nodded, and strangled her in my head. Then I left the office, bought a black forest cake, and went to find Reece.

      G�day mates,   Here�s the deal. I�ve been thinking, harder than usual, about quitting my job, since its been sucking my soul, and boss guy is a liar. Then there�s the lice, the public, the door knocking, etc. And Boss guy is pretty keen on daily communication, and I�m really not into that. I like to leave work elsewhere, and although it is not your standard 8 hour day, it is six days a week, and I�d like for it to fuck off when I�m not doing it. Right. Also, it is depressing to sell dishes to folks who need to buy their kids beds, rather than 274 channels. My first day of work, for example, (and I know, you�ve heard it thirty times) I sold a dish to a schizophrenic lady without a TV. And Boss told me he was proud.   So I talked to my parents, and my parents had an interesting take on it. Since I don�t care to be working for him, but need to find a new job, it�s time to stop caring, have fun with it, and act as though I had nothing left to lose. If he fires me, so be it, if not, buys me more time to looking for a job I don�t feel ashamed of having.  An Ode to Chad  I first met Chad at RA camp. All the people there had to toss their shoes into a pile, then the organizer separated the shoes into piles. My shoe was next to Chad�s. Clearly, we were a match made in Heaven. So we ended up in the same group, then we became partners for this annoying training game where you and your partner had to disclose embarrassing details about yourself. I learned he was sort of afraid of heights, he discovered I was dating a guy 11 years older than me. At the RA party, before the rest of the university students came, he looked at me and said �You know, sometimes, you look really sad. Sometime, I would like to know what makes you sad. If you ever need to talk, let me know.� Somewhere during that year, when I was busy cutting my hair to nil length and trying to avoid killing myself, Chad and I became friends. We were the uncouple, going to places with real couples, going out to bars together, talking on the phone ad nauseam, and driving, on his motorcycle, his car, the bus, whatever. There was also the Tim Horton�s/French prostitute ritual, and lots of hopeless chats about how mentally ill people shouldn�t date. The next year, we got accused of having sex in Chad�s office (wrote a story about that, will post after), he wrote his thesis, and basically, hilarity ensued. When I got engaged, he was happy for me.  I am lucky, or perhaps blessed, to have a friend that can talk about how to kill people, enjoys watching superman, and plays You don�t Know Jack, even though he regularly gets his ass booted all around the place.   I remember going through phases of understanding Chad. At first, I thought he was conceited. Then, I thought he wasn�t, he just pretending to be conceited to be funny. Then, I realised, he�s conceited, pretends to be not conceited, by taking his conceitedness to an extraordinary degree. Side note: He thinks it�s funny.  So here�s another happy fuzzy, you big geek. Now go burn Age of Mythology for me, or black and white two.

      I think I may have had the world�s best poutine last night. (Not the curds kind, the wimpy gravy and mozzerella kind.) Kurt and I had planned to go to a pub or some such for supper, alas, it being a holiday and all, there were few culinary choices. We went to this pizza place I dimly remembered from being a student. It was like finding a ten dollar bill in a jacket pocket; the food was amazing.   Saw The Two Towers a few nights ago. It pretty much knocked my socks off. I admit, though, I�m an anal retentive ass when it comes to movies about books I love. The Fellowship was great, but there were a few points about the movie that drove me nuts. Pippin and Mery were idiots in the first movie, unfair, considering that those two figured out Frodo�s secret in the book. I know the movie needed comic relief, as it was intense, but they could have used the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, like the did in the second, instead of making Pippin and Merry clueless dorks. But, on the other side of things, I�m glad Sam wasn�t a big old tard, which was the case in the cartoon adaptation. (If you haven�t seen that, by the way, go find it. It�s not the goofy Hobbit with crappy animation, but the one entitled Lord of the Rings. I�m pretty sure Peter Jackson took a few things from that movie. (Not a bad thing.)  I was told tonight by the Traveller that folks around home have been worried about the money situation. Odd how that�s comforting. (they care, they like me�) I�m not going to say that the money situation is all cleared up, but we are now caught up with rent, the phone bill, Kurt�s Alberta health care; and coming soon; the power and the wedding rings. I suppose right now my only real worry is the job. I hate it. I dislike working with my-co-workers, I caught god damned LICE,  and although my job is somewhat limitless with how much money I could make, it�s also floorless, giving no room for illness, or fatigue. And, boss man lied, told me initially that there would be no cold calling; that someone would be making appointments for me, and that they didn�t do any of that door-to-door shit�.

      The Ghost in the Cabin  All right, so Kurt went to sleep one night (morning) at 5am. Our Cordy is not one hundred percent housebroken, so there was a few poos on the loose. Kurt and I have often marvelled how such large poo can come out of such an eensy anus, but this is one of the mysteries Cordy holds. Kurt cleaned the couple o�poo, and he fell asleep. I awoke at eight, and let the dogs out to do their dirty deeds outdoors, they happily went out, and little Cordy had another hero-sized poo. Back to sleep went I, and awoke again around 11am. In that space, of a mere 3 hours, there were eight poos strewn about the hallway, strategically placed so, if Sis woke up and had to relieve her own bowels, she would be quite literally full of shit. I made a move to clean the poo, but Herr Gag reflex implored me to get assistance. I woke a semi-grumpy Kurt up to clean, and I let zee dogs out again. Kurt attested that there was more than one animal pooping on the floor in those three hours; could Lucas have regressed? I considered this point and deemed it unlikely, since Lucas is too prissy to even go outside when it�s raining, let alone crap in his own personal space (unless, of course, he were ill, or desperately seeking revenge.) As Kurt was cleaning the poo, getting more and more frustrated, I noticed that there was yet another poo that I had previously not spied, I warned him too late as he stepped backwards in some mess. I had not seen this poo before. I dropped my glance downwards, and there was a menacing poo at my feet, previously unnoticed. I was lucky enough not to step in it, and I heard Kurt groan as he flattened another poop. To bring this up to speed; there were now 11poos where previously eight questioned my stomach�s tenacity.  I counted. It was daylight. Another note; Cordy had not eaten since the night before. And she pooped approximately 13 times in 7 hours? The thought would be that this was a Diearrea sort of poo, but nope. These poos, were firm, human sized, and not the greasy smear that diaherrtic doggie poo usually announces itself. (K, so spell checker cacked when I tried to spell the poo word that begins with D�spelling suggestions, anyone?) All of the sudden, as I stared at the poop at my feet, I realised that this situation was entirely ridiculous. Insane. Unreal. And then, I had an epiphany; like someone had lifted the veil on the mystery of the poo. It was the fricken HOUSE pooing! A poltergeist with an overactive, corporeal bowel. A bad spirit with equally noxious intestines. Or, simpler; something in the house was changing things around to make frustration the prevailing theme. I mean, we left all the animals, three dogs and a cat alone, on full stomachs for over twelve hours the night previous. We came back to Paul�s where Cordy had eaten some paper, and peed on the floor once. ONCE. Also, as of the last two weeks or so before our holiday excursion, she was asking to go outside when she experienced full intestines. Our problem was that Cordy didn�t seem to get that pee was another bodily function not allowed in the house.  Ghost poo. You read it here first. Thus concludes the tale.    What's your New Year's Resolution? I never have one, leastwise, not one that begins on the New Year. But something I am going to try to do is remember the things that i find important. Intitutively, I would think that by virtue of things being important, I wouldn't forget them. Not so. One thing I�m ashamed of forgetting bit my ass today. The West Memphis Three are still in jail, have been in jail since 1993, and after finding about the case from my dear friend Roger Ebert, I promptly forgot all about it. Forgot that three guys around my age got tossed into jail wrongfully, and are likely to stay there until they die. And I forgot. Well, not this time, though. Go to the web page on these guys. Then, pray for justice for these, and the many others like them.     http://www.wm3.org/

      The kids of the Family are SICK. We're talking fever, snottiness irritabilty, and a general malaise that wafts throughout the house. The baby, being fussy, slept on me today; he didn't want to go back to his crib. Sitting there, with a feverish, snot ridden baby made me thing about maternal feelings, and whether or not I have them. I think I do, somewhere, I like kids, I espcially like when they're quiet, but they're gross a lot of the time, dirty most of the time, and loud a fair bit of the time. I enjoy kids and babies company overall, but I don't feel an overwhelming urge to cuddle them, pick them up and kiss them or anything, and, emphatically, newborns are not cute. They're weird little wrinkled pink things, more like alien raisins than  fellow human beings. But if I had to choose between being in a room with kids, or adults, kids would win. On the other hand, if it were kids, adults, and animals, animals would win, paws down.  Fricken Kurt needs an indoor voice; waking me up this morning at five am, talking with Jacen the mouth piece. However, he was ridicously happy to talk to Jacen, how could anyone be mad at that? I suppose I could blame Jacen and all his damn talking; but Jacen is the one person I can't seem to ever get mad at. Ever. God knows how he does it.  Reading "The Beauty Myth" by Naomi Wolf right now. It's good, but I refrained from taking it home, as I should moderate myself on reading or watching anything inflamatory. Watching "Bowling for Columbine" pissed me off about the World In General for weeks. "Bitch", well, I still think about "Bitch". What I need are some nice, quality comic books.   Anyways, that's it for now. Remember not to eat snow, and also, evil never wins. Ever.   Jeez, i wonder when the last time i had a shower was?

      Dreamt an ending to a story I have not written; about topics I never really thought I would ever write about; a serial killer. I'm not going to write the ending here in case it becomes one of those ideas that ferments in my consciousness until I have to write it down. It could be that around the time of dreaming, I was watching too much Law and Order.   Rent's still a sketchy thing; nothing short of a miracle will let us pay it on time. It will get paid, I have no doubt, but not on time. I suppose that doesn't really matter, as long as it does, in fact, get paid, but the sliding by on things is starting to get to me. I know I should not have allowed myself to get fired from The Dish Selling; at the same time I know I would have killed myself before the month was up had I stayed on. All the lying, the driving, the stupid people, the lice, the complaints, I know it wasn't worth it. But, it was decent pay, and that's something we need. I am also feeling a general doubt as to whether I can be a good, happy worker person. I was feeling all right about being a nanny, but it's the little things that get a person, right? I screwed up the molasses cookies last time I was over. They tasted pretty zarking foul. Not a big deal, so why does it feel like a big deal? Does my brain really need to create drama? And the Dad guy..why do I want to poke his beady little eyes out? I've got no concrete reason, other than he thinks animals are useless, and that he makes strikingly idiotic observations, whilst taking the 'I've seen it all stance'. He can't be completely bad guy; the kids love him, and so does the Mommy woman, but everytime I so much as see the guy, my hair hurts, my teeth itch, and pimples start exploding over my face.  I feel like I'm waiting for something.

      I think I may becoming increasingly more anti-social. Not exactly in the want-to-burn-things-down sort of way, but in the sort of stand-up comedian sort of way; I sort of hate people, they're stupid, and I don't want to interact with them ever. It could be the result of too much pop, and not enough vegetables or something.  Watched The Vigin Suicides again. I love that movie. Love it. Every emotion makes an entrance in that movie, and it is directed like a dream, or a particularily lovely but sad poem. I always feel an immense satisfaction after watching it, although it raises more questions than it answers.  Been thinking about a girl I knew in school a lot lately. Not sure if that means I should call her, or i'm just feeling nostalgic. Think I'll call her anyways. She's not too far from me now, and her sense of the positive is almost a physical thing, she is a person that can and will do things; all manners and sorts of things that are extraordinary, and special. There's another reason too. For the last six months or so, I feel a sense of panic when I think of someone I've not thought of for a while; I think they're dead. I don't think they're dead because we lost contact with one another, just that they've died. Another eccentricity to go one the list, I suppose.

      Ok.  Kurt is possibly gonig to get about 2 grand from Student Loan, evidently, there was a mixup in our favor. He was also awarded a 2000 dollar bursary Rent is looming, might be able to pay it by using the aforementioned bursary, through the grace of The Powers That Awarded said bursary. Waiting to get a check from mom, courtesy of co-op to cover car payment.  I think that's it on the finances. Phoebe has regained her sight, figure it was blurred vision from her surgery, and she lost an ear. We haven't found it yet. Babysat yesterday, cleaned the Family's house, did their laundry, entertained their kids, baked bad tasting cookies, and all of this for 6/hr. Makes me appericiate Moms, most of the time, they don't get paid at all. Nonetheless, I did work my ass off for little renumeration. And that sucks. The job is good, and it is satisfying in that i can see the day's work completed. That does not suck. As soon as i get a better paying job, I'm going to leave, that sucks; the dad is a prat, so that makes it not suck so badly.   Is it just me, or does life seem to be unecessarily complicated?  Also, Solace is having bad dreams similar to mine. We're both killing people a lot. No answers there, neither of us know where it's coming from. Not exactly worrisome, but makes one consdier carefully what one should eat before going to bed. We talked about Runes, you know, the ancient FUTHARK alphabet that a lot of modern languages come from. I've been in contact with runes since i was about 13. They've always been nice to ask advice of, offering consequences for asked-about actions. I had always assumed that this was a crude method of hearing whispers from the Divine, as a sort of conscience illustrating what i ought to do in a given situation. The other thought was that it was me, a sort of higher me, one that knew consequences better than I did. A Platonist Jiminy Cricket, i guess. Kurt offered another thought, though.. that perhaps the runes' are evil, or simply not good, or whatever. This throws me for a loop. I mean, I haven't even used them for a long time, and my other dalliance is easily explained using psychology; the runes are not. So where am I now? I've always liked the ceramic, one of the runes is where R comes from, the rune is called Raido, and it means journey. My sister's first letter is there too. The runes never acted like a voice in my head telling me to burn things, nor have they ever showed one particular destiny. What they had always done was show a call to action, and if the call to action was followed through, it showed the consequences of that action. Is that evil, or non good, or is it anything worth mentioning? is it the whispers i had taken them to be? Right now, my gut tells me that they are nothing worth mentioning, they never were, they were just a comforting toy, a glorified magic eight ball. An adolecent sooky-blanket. But they worked, or my brain found connections that had no business being there.  I still have them, largely unused, excepting on the occasions where i pick one up, and hope that it will be my first letter rune. They stay around like blind bear, or my wisdom teeth, or the book of fairy tales that used to facinate and frighten the shit out of me. (The Fairytales are the complete book of Grimm - not for the faint hearted.) I suppose, in the end, it doesn't largely matter where the info I was getting was coming from. If it was evil, good turned it round, and if it was good to begin with - good. The bottom line is that I don't need them any more to see the consequences of a particular action. Time to set aside childish things, i guess, but you don't have to throw them away.

      This getting up early in the morning crap has got to stop to spare my sanity. It's too cold to be real outside, there's nothing to do inside, and I can't seem to distract myself from feelings of 'I suck'ness. It could be boredom, cabin fever, or any one of those things that can get me feeling funky. After all, it is winter, and winter always gives me annoying feelings.  Phoebe appears to be blind. Her eyes react to light differences, but all she sees in general is a big blur. She is scared of Fida and to a lesser extent, Lucas, because she is unsure about what they're going to do. However, she still gets around ok, and she isn't in any pain, so,  we're ok too. Figure the cause of blindness was her operation, either a side effect from the anatheisa, a build up of spinal fluid pressure, or a combination. Talked to the vet myself, he wasa fucking idiot, and should never be near animals.  On the upside, she does seem to be coming around slowly. I hope i'm not just seeing what i want to see.

      Made it to the pub last night, although i came really close to not going; really glad I did. Did not get to talk to the Prof as much as I would like, but made new friends, enjoyed myself immensely, and felt relaxed.   Had a dream last night where I was doing an anti-war rally. I was yelling stuff from my soapbox, and I closed with "Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity!!" Kurt was awake for some reason, and he thought i was talking to him. Hilarity somewhat ensued, although I stayed asleep for the whole thing. I remember the dream, but do not remember sitting up in bed and yelling that to Kurt. It was confusing, Kurt said.  We have a new foster cat, her name is Phoebe. Her uterus is newly removed, and when she was found, she was starving to death, and her ears had severe frostbite. She's very mellow, although she doesn't know what to make of Lucas. Fida doesn't like her, but I figure they'll get along when everything settles down. Phoebe might yet lose her ears. They look a little wrong, not much, but they're hard and seem like they'll crumble if you nudge them. I'm a little worried about her losing them; she won't be overly adoptable then, because a cat without ears looks a lot like a wee, fuzzy alien. A lot of people don't like aliens. No worries for her though, if there isn't anyone to adopt her, we probably will. She's black and white, and like Fida, hasa nose that's part pink and part black. Her fur is so shiny is seems almost blue. She's still very skinny, but she seems to be pretty happy with attention, regular meals, and a warm place to sleep. We'll put a gut on her yet.  Keep thinking about when I'll have to ditch my job. I like it, a lot, but there's not enough money. It's six an hour, and there's EVERYTHING to be paid,  food to buy, and I have no idea how we're going to make rent on time in march. I'll be making 240 a week when i begin regularily, and with the rent being 500/month, the car payment being 300 something, utilites about 150/month, and plus ring payments and other crap that I always forget about but comes to chomp on my butt later, the pay is frighteningly low. It's not entirely fair that being a nanny isn't considered skilled work, there's so much to know, do, remember, and hell, you're looking after children, ensuring their safety, I tend to find it a little weird that grants aren't given out to moms to have their kids taken care of well. Such is life, though. I feel dishonest, though, i mean the Family hired me in good faith, they probably wouldn't have if they knew I was in the market for something higher paying.   There's no need to be worrying about this. It's not going to help allievate guilt, or help me in any way. Zoodles, however, will feed my hunger. So, to Zoodles I now turn.

      Did the first full day of the nanny thing, one of the kids is big on saliva. BIG. I asked him to watch where he was spraying whilst feeding zee baby, and the kid turned his face up, spat, and caught it in his mouth. Yargh. I also did the family's laundry, and was momentarily disgusted by doing other people's laundry. The Family isn't dirty, or anything like that, but man, i was touching their underwear.  Besides momentary lapses into being profoundly disgusted, it wasa good day. played, read a lot on Greek Myths, and boogied with the baby.   Tonight, possibly, Kurt and I go out to the pub to hang out with the english professor that scared the crap out of me when I was a frosh. He's scotch, soft voice, nice, but occasionally was given to screaming and bashing his fist off the desk in class. I also noticed that year that the man was a close talker, and never reffered to anyone by name. Out of class he'd nod and wink at me. He's a great teacher, wow. Took Literary Criticism (AKA Literary Cynicism) with him my second year, and I probably have never had so much fun in a class in my life, although eating brandy chocolates in German frosh year is a close second.  Car payments are coming up, rent in a little bit, and I'm still not working full time. This observation typically causes me to crap and want to crawl under a rock and die, but, with the exception of my student loan, and our engagement rings; we are up to date on every single solitary bill. Yay! Of course, doing laundry just willy-nilly would be excellent, but hey, I'm saving my quarters for a pint with the professor.  Nothing more to say today, feel free to write in with a topic you'd like to read, and i'll pontificate away. Except you,Chad. You as a topic is not an option. If you want to read about yourself, either hire someone to write about you, or write it yourself, and pretend it's someone who knows you and talks about you insessantly. Or come down and visit me, and I'll write about that.

      Bless internet piracy in all its glory; i have movies on my computer via d/c, an excellent p2p sharing community thingamabob. Been spending time watching movies, most noteably, the Disney version of Robin Hood. Ahh, such sweetness.   Been half-assedly trying to remedy A) My life as a recluse and B) I don't have a name for this yet, although it may come under the Lazy catergory; I have this tendancy to not do things unless i have to. So there you go, two post-new year resolutions.  Granger and Co. help facilitate my foray into the wonderful world of shared movies; Kurt and I went over to her place on Saturday. Her varied and interesting circle of friends played a VCR Star Trek game. Watching it, and them, was hilarious. It's dumb, though. I enjoy my time there immensely, and I like Granger and her friends, even though i can't remember most of their names. However, I always feel I'm imposing. Like I'm an alien from another planet. This feeling is not exclusive to Granger and her merry band of tards, there's another friend here that I've known for a long time. And I'd say about every third time I talk to her, I feel the Me-As-An-Alien thing happen, and I wonder why would she like me, want to spend time with me, etc. Yeah, yeah, I'm a complicated weirdo, call it one of my eccentricities. I'll work on it next year. It does sort of happen with everybody. I get it in my head i'm a nuisance, and I'll vanish.   I beat Age of Mythology. Only on moderate, though. It was zarking hard nonetheless. I'm not one of those folks that always had a game console in my house; it was junior high before i didn't die on the first level of mario. And then, for years, I was preoccupied with how, in Mario's worlds, there appears to be no fricton. If you get a mushroom stuck between two pipes it will bang off each one until the end of time. If there was fricton, eventually the mushroom would slow, and eventually stop.  I had a weird dream last night, about my mom giving me a fantasically ugly and huge St. Christopher's medallion. Isn't it funny how people will almost always say  "I had a WEIRD dream last night" ? Like you need weird in there.. it's a given, really.  Rambling has set it, time to throw in the towel. Good night, or, should I say Good Morning, since that's when chad reads this.  I miss Cordy.

      HAHAAAAAA! Stupid illness! HAW!  I'm not sick anymore, think I managed to kick the vestiges by sleeping and more sleeping. Of course, this means that I am not sleeping right now, at 4am, but it is a small price to pay for having the sensation of drowning in one's own mucus removed from one's person. Air is nice.    Been reading "Bitch" by Elizabeth Wurtzel. At times, I have to put the book down because it's like getting socked in the gut. I know I wrote this before, but I do forget, being a semi-functional shut-in and all, that being female sucks ass. One could say that about being a man, too, I suppose, but I have no experience of that, and a lot of experience having boobs. Reading "Bitch" reminded me of how I felt when I worked at the golfcourse. Every day when I was on matinence, I was asked by co-workers to have sex with them.They assumed, because I was female, that I didn't swear, couldn't pump gas, or drive. On one occasion, a co worker grabbed my ass and held on. Before that, another one stuck out two fingers and said "Why should you use these two fingers to masturbate?" I shook my head, I mean, what the fuck do you say to things like that? "Because they're mine," he said, this guy who was married to a woman who used to babysit me.  What do you say to that? How do you react? It's stupid, but comments like that scare the hell out of me. Someone tried to rape me when I was nine, when I was in second year university, a guy tried to get into the shower with me in my dorm. So, when some guy says something like that to me, it's my knee-jerk response to be hostile, better to be thought of as a bitch than have this guy thinking I like and want his skanky attentions. I have this fear that the minute I'm even remotely nice to someone who sidles up to me at a bar, or makes a remark, that I'm just opening myself up for more of the same. Being a mouth was not an option at the golfcourse, because, well, it was a small hick place there, and any one getting on the unpopular list was going to be in a world of hurt. If I had of reported the ass grab, there's no doubt in my mind that I would have been fired. The guy that did it was in the union, was senior to me by at least 15 years, and I was but a mere student peon. A few years before, a girl had been raped, actually raped, and The Powers That Be made her drop the suit. No one would come forward,on her behalf although there were other women that this guy handled. They didn't come forward because, one told me "Well, what would everybody think of me, then? What if he beat me up? i just can't."  I let the ass grab slide, although, I summoned up all my bravado, sounded off a fair amount of expletives at the Man With The Wandering Hands, and told him if he so much as breathed on me again, I would rupture his nutsack. (We were alone, otherwise, I would have just laughed it off) He mumbled something scornfully about me being one of 'those liberated women types' and in the weeks that followed, I began a rumor that professed my homosexuality.  In later years, I became the Beer Cart girl and Bartender. Guys from away, dressed in golfer clothes and sporting bitch tits told me where their hotel room was and that they would make a visit from me worth my while. Out drinking with my friends at the legion, the golfers would be there, drunken tourists, all remembering me because I had helped get them drunk in the first place. That summer, I got to slow dance with a plethora of bad smelling, drunken golfers, and I didn't even have the recourse to tell them to fuck off. My boss let me know that. On golfcourse, or off, it didn't matter, Beer Cart Girl must always be the polite public servant.  What I really notice now, in and after university, is that either you aren't taken seriously enough as a girl, or you're way too intense. I can't count how many times I've been told that I think too much. Guys who talk about puking and pooping their pants at the same time whilst drunk can't handle the fact that their girl might have tampons in her medicine cabinet. And girls who like sex, well, they're sluts. Girls who don't are frigid. I was a girl who didn't, and I was a 'Dyke'. Or frigid, depending on who you talked to.  Seriously, I know guys have it tough. I'm not going to sit here and pontificate on how girls have it way worse. I don't know, and I don't care, to be honest. Every single one of us has a bunch of problems, I think most can be attributed to socialization and bad choices, or whatever. I'm just saying: "I hate it." There's no reason why guys have to be paragons of machismo, there is no logical reason why women get paid 70 cents on the dollar. It sucks that it doesn't matter if you'll be a better cop, the native chick is going to get it first, although she couldn't pass the old physical standards. (They changed them, so that way, women could bet into the RCMP easier. Fuck that. I don't care if a cop is a male or female, but they had better be in shape, and be competent in their job. A woman trained and did *well* as a Navy SEAL in the US, you cannot reasonably tell me it's impossible for a woman to achieve the old standard of RCMP physicals. And, on a side note, those cops should stay in shape. I'm talking yearly physcials, you doughnut eating freaks.)    None of it is fair.

      I'm not sure if i metnioned this, but Paul's House, the house that freaks me out, has burnt to a crisp. This happened about a month ago. Evidently, Crazy Uncle Paul offered Sanctuary to a female aquaintence of his. She left, the house promptly burnt. My mother suggested sabotage involving insurance or some such, but Paul's place, or as my Dad called it, The House of the Heirs, was a big nasty dump, and consequently, wouldn't be worth the gas to light it up.   I AM STILL SICK. Am I right in saying I'm always sick?  In spite of the heroic amounts of echinaeca I imbibe when my throat gets scratchy, the vitiman C I've been eating ever since, and the liquid, oh, the liquid, I've been drinking to stave off dehydration.   In other news, the Vatican has offically said that Harry Potter is A-ok by them. Read all about it here:   http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=493&ncid=762&e=6&u=/ap/20030203/ap_en_mo/vatican_harry_potter  It is also interesting to note that all her negative spiritual press has been limited to North America. Also, rumors of her books insipring young minds to court the occult can be traced back to two SATIRE websites. The Onion web site published an article where thay claimed to interview children wanting to grow up and become witches. This satire was picked up by another satire site, called Landover Baptist, who quoted the Onion article as fact. A legitimate, if uninformed Baptist website, assumed Landover was a real website, and quoted again the satire originally written by the onion. All of the sudden, claims were made that JK Rowling was corrupting the youth of North America.  *sigh*. One of the many reasons why I do a ton of research on everything I find interesting. It's bullcrap like this that leads people to believe that, on the average, a person swallows seven spiders in her sleep in a lifetime.

      I want to rip my face off. I have a cold, sore throat, and i think that i may be always sick. Maybe I can get a bubble to live in.   Dr. St. Lisa, the lovely Greek professor, has an uncertain future at the University. Much love and mojo goes out to her as she states her case as a lingering faculty member here. If Kurt and I had a reason to come out here, to the vast, stinking Maritimes, it was to get an extraordinary puppy, and to spend time with the good St. Lisa. I have never seen a prof inspire such fervor and loyality among her students; and I'm one lucky wife of goober to have met her.  I want to study Cultural Anthropology as a future career. It's a job made for the silly Robyns of this planet. You, as an anthropologist observe a culture, or subculture by livng amongst the culture, or subculture you'd like to study. You ask questions, you observe. Then, you write down your observations, occasionally drawing conclusions. You get published in academic journals, you might teach.  This is THE perfect job for me. I want to observe and live among Drag Queens, Natives, the hiirja in India, the Trobriand Islanders, although the've been done to death; I'd also like to observe practicing voodouns, and ooohhhh, Bedouins. I know it's going to be interesting, and interesting times are a curse, but to be part of so many other people's lives as a recorder is vastly, wonderfully appealing, Of course, a large problem that I'm going to have to come across are language barriers, but i think i'd be ok at learning a language by living among the speakers. Another drawback is travel; at this point, Lucas travels better than I do, but hey, worrth getting over for this. Now, I have to find out what i have to do to get student loans to fund me, and what i have to do here to help me when i move to the new university offering this program.

      I slept for the majority of the day yesterday, and it was GLORIOUS!   Today, I decided to check the joint account, and it turns out Marcus from student loan withdrew another fabulous sum of cash, making us 487 dollars short on our april rent. In the month of march, that bastard has taken 909 dollars out of our account, all of it funds distrubuted to Kurt to get him through school. Any lawyers out there? Is this legal? Today's sunday, so there isn't a damn thing that can be done about it. I'm furious. i understand that i sucked and all that, and I'm deliquent in my student loan payments, but how does Marcus expect me to get the money to them if i get evicted from my apartment? How does that work? (It does not help my mood much that we already owe Jeckyl and Hyde 300 from last month.) And besides, Kurt's name is on that account too, how can he take money from it? I guess I just don't understand the intracies of owing money to bastard banks. Ahh, well, they'll be first against the wall when the revolution comes. Avoid Royal Bank, ladies and gentlemen, they're as dumb as a bag of doorknobs, uglier in motive than a hatful of arseholes, and represent Evil here on earth.  Learning the mystic art of side order making this evening. I'm excited, although, I'm sure I'm going to smell like something deep fried upon my return home. I think it's only going to be for a few hours, after all, it is sunday, and people just aren't as interested in pizza and greasy goodness as they are on other days.

      Aghhhhhhh.  I hate this non sleeping/ sleeping like a baby shiznit. Another restful two hours of sleep last night, and boy, am i just rarin' to go. The truly wicked thing is that I do not work again until tomorrow at five, so maybe, just maybe I won't feel like a corpse then.   Check this out: I like my job. I like my co-workers. The feelings of stupidity that go with the training process are kicking off at a regular rate, and I get to work with Kurt, and a plethora of Pretty Cool People. Even the lunkhead i mentioned a few post back is a prime example of Good People. Time will tell whether or not he is as dumb as I suspect he is. (He might not be, it could be just an 18-year-old-male thing). My back is crazy sore, however, the confidence and edification of this job are well worth the pain.  For the last 2 hours or so, I've been trying to find this tile game that was on my boyfriend's computer, when I was in high school. No luck, but if this sounds familiar to anyone, please, please PLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEASSSSSSEEEE let me know. Okay. You have a few tiles, on a board. You match the tiles according to symbol, or color, or both. You must make lines of five, (or six?) and after every move, the computer plunks down a few more random tiles, in random places. It's soothing to my brain to play, and I like the additive aspect of it, instead of trying to take tiles away, like in mah jongg solitare.  George Lucas ruined youth With the steaming pile of crap That is the Prequels*   * i am, i suppose, a hypocrite, or maybe just an insane optimist when i say i will be among the first in line to get tickets to episode three. Please, George, don't do anything stupid, and cause me a stroke.   I'm starting to wonder if i have worms. I'm hungry perpetually. Then again, I am gaining weight, so, maybe no worms. On the other hand, really, with what I have been eating lately, I should be probably be waaaaaaaaaaay fatter. So, maybe, they're just little worms. That's a vivid thought, isn't it? Anyways, yeah, think i gained about 5-10 pound in the last two weeks, because i have been eating donairs, pizza, and garlic fingers, and washing it all down with coke. Oh, and then some chocolate for dessert. And then, I stated work at the pizza place, where i get seven bucks of free food every day. Lord, it is time to grant your child restraint, please. There is the temptation to see how fat i can possibly get in, say, the next month, but it's one of those unhealthy urges, like the time I left the mac and cheese in the bowl for my entire month long Christmas vacation. Or those other urges, like to turn the car into oncoming traffic, to go down a one way street the wrong way, to shave off my eyebrows, or to take a big ol' poo in front of the arts building. I call these lemming urges. They seemed to have begun my second year of university. I was late for a job interview, across main street. There were cars coming. Something snapped in my head, and i ran across the road anyways, and avoided narrowly getting myself killed, not to mention narrowly avoiding causing a massive car pile up. I still feel guilty about it. Ever since, when i ave these counter productive urges, i tell someone about it, or write it down right away, to quash it down. It's worked, so far.  I'm gonna go eat.

      I like the pizza place, my back doesn't. One of the people there pointed out this evening that although i was hired first, Kurt has more hours than I do. I sort of stared at the kid blankly, and realized that HE didn't realize that Kurt and I have the same finances, so, any money that kurt or myself would be getting would be going to the same place. It's peculiar how your thinking changes after getting married. I remember when we were dating how I always felt crappy about myself when Kurt did the treating on dates, and I felt things were 'more equal' when it was my money, or even more laughably, my MOM'S money. Things are infinitely simpler now, that way, at least.  I, Robyn, mastered the breadmaker. Friends haven't been able to, largely to do with the odd requirement of the ingredients; they have to be room temperature, and, measured precisely. The bread still kind of tasted like ass, but since it was bread-in-a-box, I can't take responsibilty for it. Besides, with some peanut butter, it's splendid.  I've said it, i think, a thousand times. And, the thing is, I'm probably going to keep on saying it; i miss Cordy. Some days, like today, it feels like she just died yesterday, and i wish ferverently that I could put my fingers around the bastard driver's neck and squeeze until she came back. It's the one big hole in our state and definition of Happy. (being happy, in the world acording to Kurt and myself is not wanting to change anything about the situation a body is at that moment; not needing/wanting anything more, or less; being content.) Given the choice, I'm not so sure I'd be able to pass up having her little golden head, her lean black body drinking the bathwater, or crapping on the floor. What can I say? She was a puppy, she was just getting the hang of things, and she was Our Dog. Lucas loves Kurt, and the other way around, but Kurt is relatively new in our dynamic, and, for better, or worse, Lucas will always be My dog. Fida is Kurt's cat. I love her, of course, but the fact remains. Phoebe, for now, is our beloved Guest, and we've had many Beloved Guests. But Cordy, well, Cordy was Our dog, and we lost her, to stupidity, all the way around.   Perhaps that's why the Family got under my skin as much as they did; they were not animal people. The Dad didn't understand the attachment; an animal must be functional, a utility, or it should be destoyed. Nothing could be simpler. And I'll probably never understand that. (Hell, I *pray* I won't.) Animals, to me, are the only real innocents among us, even in their adulthood. Even when they're predators. I don't think I can explain.  There are lots of shitty human beings out there, but I've yet to see a dog that isn't a good dog, or a cat not a good cat, or any sort of animal that is not an exemplary example of that type of animal.

      Some Haikus, because I can...   Poor Kurt, feel better, I feel bad for making you sick Your sick snoring sucks (It's true, he's sicker than I am at this point. What is amusing is his continued bafflement at being sick, it's not something that happens to him. I bet it's the mold...)  Poo punched on face For his cash in his wallet Run faster next time  (My friend is feeling fairly outraged at been mugged over 12 bucks. If anyone has had a similar experience, write me, so I can tell him people do get over these things, somewhat. The rest of you, send mojo, before he goes all nuts and starts shooting...)  Granger wants romance Or she will become a nun Black *is* flattering...  (Alas, poor Granger, she wants to be wined and dined. She does deserve it, for the record, but maaaaaan, good luck with that.)  Exiled in London The Chad suffers from boredom It's Karma, baby.  (It's Karma for his corporate pig-ism! I predict more haikus about Chad... he loves the attention. )  Jacen wants to shine Says I never mention him Well, talk to me, punk!  (Jacen, if you've been reading the comments, has been bellyaching that i never mention him. however, since he never IMs me, I figure it's righteous retribution. That's right, ya bugger, I know you never sleep, so get on icq/messenger, and share the joy!)  If i missed you in this week's haikus, don't feel bad, or relieved, because, rest assured, I'll get you sometime.

      I am Jack's complete lack of an immune system. Yesterday, I played the role of Girl Dying. Wow. Got those red and yellow capsules, though, seems to be clearing this up, or a high fever has invaded my head. It would certainly explain my dreams; I got into a big fight with my grandmother over black rights in the US of A, in another dream, my entire family were fugitives, and I left them, because they wouldn't take Lucas to Mexico. But, you know what? It is five to nine in the am, and although I woke up for a few hours last night, and woke up a few hundered times besides, I feel rested, and slept between the hours of 11 till 8. Of course, it may be the fact that I've been eating advil like candy, but I think it's best not to dwell.  I have another job interview! This is for a careerish one about a half hour commute away. I'd be helping out with a Youth-At-Risk program, and it's a year long dealio. The interview is on April 2.   Another note on the living situation; there's a lady with a family and an acreage on the outskirts of town who might be willing to rent out a few rooms to myself and Kurt. I've got to talk to the lady about logistics and all, but there is a jacuzzi involved. I'm still undecided about how to mention to my Jeckyl and Hyde landlords about being released from the lease early, if we should even ask and all that. Thoughts? I mean, I do have that confirmation from Dr. Strange. However, the unpredicabilty of the landlords is a big, scary, factor. We're also behind on our rent 300 bucks, and although the two topics are mutually exclusive, it definitely contributes to my need to avoid them at all costs. (We'll be in the position to pay them back in the middle, or the end of April, we're not trying to escape without paying.)  I need new books to read.  First full night of work is happening this evening, four pm til closing. Send me mojo.   And on that note, sleep heals, I'm going to heal some more.

      Spent 3 HOURS at the clinic last night. The doctor was peculiar little close-talking hairy man with a great bedside manner, and bleached teeth. He agreed that permasick is most likely caused by the mold, but in order to get anything in writing, I must go see my family doctor. So do I wait til I get the shiznit in writing, or do I mention things to my landlord now?   Granger gave me the contact number for a new apartment, it's looking like a one bedroom dealio, in an apartment building half a block or so from where we're at now. The building is by the highway, but I have hopes that we'll not hear the road sounds. Not a terrifically big deal anyhow, sleeping in the City was all about the cars going zoom. The lady I spoke to has a dog, and we have a choice of either living in her basement apartment (no tub), or in the apartment building (closer to the highway) She's going to give me a call later on to set up a time where Kurt and I can go see the place.  Finally got to watch the She-Ra movie. I liked it, even though there was a lot of lame stuff in it. The title song is a duet, and it's Mike Bolton quality. It's amazingly terrible. It's stuck in my head. It's stuck in my head til the end of time. I still get the chills when he-man's transforming, and he reverbs "I have the POWER!!!" Yeah, I want a sword, a Battle Cat, and fight in a loincloth. Well, not that last one. And, I forgot that He-man is stronger than Superman, it's insane. She-Ra too, come to think of it. Anyways, I'm going to end this nerdy paragraph about a little known fact about She-Ra and He-Man's mom. Her name is Queen Marlena, and she's an astronaut that crashed on Eternia. She's from Earth. Evidently, the reason why Adam and Adora are special in their HeShe ways is because of their Mom's orgins.   The last three weeks or so, I've been drooling on my pillow. A lot. Even if i take special pains to sleep a certain way, I'll wake up a little damp on the side of the face. Perplexing.  Poor Jacen, I don't talk about him in my blog enough.

      So, you know how I'm always shiny mcwhinying about being sick all the time? I think I know why. Not why I'm whining about it, but why i'm permasick. My nose is typically runny, my cough will not go away, then there are the migraines, the rashes (on my face, Jacen, so shut it!). Perma flu. There's also the occasional barfage. Right. There's also some freaky shit growing on my walls. Black stuff, on the exterior walls, but on the inside, if you know what I mean.  I'm also a perma nerd as well as being perma sick, so I researched the freaky shit. The freaky shit is mold. Black, stupid mold, and I should note, at this point that it is spreading. Not much, but there you have it. (I think I may have even mentioned it before, even) I found an article on it, the website is this:   http://www.familyhandyman.com/200003/how_a_house_works/main.html  The quote that I was most interested in was this:  "One consultant we interviewed confessed he crawls around in moldy places day after day, month in and month out, and never suffers ill effects. Others�some estimate about 10 percent of the population�are severely allergic to mold. It�s primarily the dinky reproductive spores that people react to. Twenty of them sitting side by side could fit across the period at the end of this sentence. That means they�re hard to filter out. The spores also have an incredible �hang time� (as my teenage son would say); they�re able to stay suspended in midair for hours on end. That means they�re easily inhaled.   With even slight exposure to molds and spores, sensitive people may experience headaches, runny noses, skin rashes, nausea, sinus problems, memory loss and coughs. They may feel listless for long periods of time. In short, they feel as though they have a perpetual case of the flu."  Sweet son of God on a Honda. Well, there's no memory loss, anyways. What was I saying? Har Har Har Ho Ho.  I decided to keep on researching. I was thinking about the Mother of All Migranes I had a few weeks ago, the coughing,  the rashes, and the fact that Kurt got a wart on his foot now, and thought. Ok, there's got to be a way to clean it. Reading further on in the article, and in the other do-it-yourselfer website, the answer was NO. Not short of bringing down the walls, anyways. Great. I thought about phoning my landlord and telling him what was up, but I told him about the mold before, and he just kinda went 'Gee," and continued on his merry way, and so did I. Next Website, entitled Mold as A Threat To Human Health:   http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byorg/abbey/an/an18/an18-6/an18-602.html  "The American Medical Association's Family Medical Guide (1987 edition) discusses "Fungal Diseases of the Lungs" on p. 571, saying that there are several diseases that are caused by fungi, and they primarily infect the lungs. They include blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. (The fungus causing the last of these diseases is found, oddly enough, in semi-arid desert soil.) Fungal diseases (mycoses) often clear up without treatment, but may spread throughout the body in the bloodstream and cause dangerous complications. Sometimes there are no symptoms; sometimes there are flu-like symptoms; and sometimes a rash, ulcer or warts may appear on the skin. The infection may settle in parts of the body not directly exposed to the pathogen: the menenges (membranes surrounding the brain), liver, prostate gland or other organs. The good news is that such infections, if properly diagnosed, can be treated with intravenous or other antifungal medication."  mmmmmm menenges. Great word.   So, I'm going to a doctor this evening, and if said doctor confirms my suspisicions (Hypochondria?). I think then, my next action will be politely asking the landlord if Kurt and I can get out of the lease early, due to these problems. It's a little much to ask him to rip down the walls, after all. Most leases here run May-May, so, we have an okay chance of getting a place. There is a sweet piece of legislation in the Residential Tenancies Act:   Early termination for health reasons   10C Notwithstanding Section 10, where a tenant or a family member of a tenant in a year-to-year tenancy has suffered a significant deterioration in health that, in the opinion of a medical practitioner, results in the inability of the tenant to continue the lease or where the residential premises is [are] rendered inaccessible to the tenant, the tenant may terminate the tenancy by giving the owner  (a) one months notice to quit; and (b) a certificate of a qualified medical practitioner evidencing the significant deterioration of health. 1993, c. 40, s. 9.  You might be wondering why I'm so anal about the research thing and the legislation. I've had bad luck with finky landlords, and although this guy has been a bastion of patience with the horrors of newlywedded unemployed students for tenants, he's also been an expletitive about other things. Like, putting up blinds, being nice about the zoo, then going postal on us about the zoo, the whole lock thing, and the sporadic plowing of driveways. Little things. He's no fink, but I think if i went to him with out all this red tapey crap at my beck and call, he'll be feeding me the mold, and telling me the reason we have it is because of all the animals. Or something. Last thing I want to do is cause trouble for this guy and his gal, his baby and his dog. But if I'm right, I'm out of this apartment quicker than, I dunno, something quick.  LOVED the pizza place last night, although I was glassy eyed and stupid due to lack of sleep. First full night is Thursday, and Kurt has the job there as well. Pizza Mama is 23. She  looks her age, but has the air of a Lady-in-Profund-Control, though, and that gives her an air of maturity. Thought she was at least 28. She's amazing to be around, very open and full of quips. The other folks there were great as well, although one boy-man is about as dumb as lint. Really nice, but dumb.  I'm now sleeping like a baby; up every two hours. Hey, beats the shit out of the two hours total i've been getting the last little bit. Still don't know about the full disclosure thing I mentioned yesterday, still, you know, weighing and considering and suchlike.  Granger would make an exceptionally awful nun. Just so you know.

      Phobe and Fida's belly fur is finally growing back, i had no idea that their skin is the same color as the overgrowing fur. You learn something new everyday, or so they tell me.   I woke up again at three, i gave up and got up at four. Ugh. Have to go to work at four pm, I wonder if it's a good idea to sleep between now and then. I am leaning on the side of yeah, it is, because I have no idea how long I'm going to be there tonight, and I'd rather not collapse into a snoring heap, or cause some sort of kitchen catastrophe because I was tragically fatigued. I was just thinking, unless I happen to get day shift, which I kinda doubt will happen, it's not overly likely my sleep schedule will be that of your average person. This is disconcerting, but I suspect it will be less so after I get paid once or twice.   It will be really convient to get paid on a regular basis. I know now where money for car payments will come from, and that's a huge amount of relief. I still have the screaming heebie jeebies as to whether or not I'm capable of work on a regular basis. It's been a long time, and I feel fairly disturbed most of the time. Kurt keeps assuring me that there isn't anything wrong with me, and occasionally makes me say "There isn't anything wrong with me." Unfortunately, this isn't how things feel. There is an awful zarking amount of time where it does feel that there is something horribly awry in my head. Things make me sad, and it appears that I'm the only one that finds them sad. I think it's a lot like being burned; when that new flesh grows, it's tremendously sensitive, and a lot of everything hurts the burned place, even after the healing process has made a lot of progress. I guess it's just that it feels like my mind somewhere along the way has been burned. I think that may be part of the reason I'm such a homebody, the less stimuli, the less pain. No doubt that's a terrifically unhealthy, avoidant way of looking at things, but hey, I'm still here, so it must be working sort of ok  Is it unethical, or simply bad form to discuss personal difficulties with other individuals on here? I mean, i would if this were, strictly speaking, a journal. I pride myself on pulling no punches when discussing on here my current state of mind. A few times, though, it's bitten me rather firmly on the bum. Things like, you know, scaring the shit out of someone who hasn't talked to me in while, stumbles on my blog and thinks..."Hooooookay, Robyn went a little apeshitty in her past and did some fairly rash things. I wonder if she's going to jump out in front of a bus?"  Eeee. I know I've said this before, but this blog thing is not about scaring  the shit out of friends and family, but a way to work through the crap I find myself in. And, when I started, I had intended it to be exactly like journals I've had before. But, as of late, I've been wondering where that line is. I try to avoid saying things like "This person did this, what an asshole," or "So and so has a large, large ass," etc. I don't want to piss people off, for one, for another, what possible good can writing libel do? However, I wouldn't be adverse to discussing disagreements I've had, specific problems with other people. But, is that a good idea?  I lean toward it being theraputic, in the same vein as writing about current states of mind. But, I'm talking out of my ass. Feedback, please.

      It's snowing again AGAIN. It's wet, it's cold, roads are slimy, and it's all snow's fault.   Just got back from Zee Interview, and, as it turns out, it wasn't an interview. It was more of a "So, this is what you look like. Neat. Can you come in tomorrow?" So, I go in tomorrow, at four, and stay for a few hours, and decide whether or not I want to work there. I was deeply impressed with the Pizza Mama, she studied criminology, is a very straight shooter, is funny, and talked about how the kitchen at the pizza place is more of a home than a workplace. I glibly slimed Kurt's name in there, so after Pizza Mama talked to me, she talked to him, and, it looks fairly likely that he'll be hired full time there as well, it's just a question of talking to Pizza Daddy. They have a no couples hiring policy, but Pizza Mama, Kurt and I reckon that's more of a hiring boyfriend girlfriends thing than hiring husband wife thing. It may sound waaaaaaay co-dependant and stuff, but I really like the idea of working with Kurt. I worked with him in a kitchen before, and it was good, we do work well together. Added to which, the idea is comforting. Of course, it could be the case that we'll drive each other mental, but since we're already well on our way in that direction anyhow, it hardly seems to matter. Of course, on our way out, we got some supper things, and Pizza Mama recognized us from our order. Yeah. We eat there a lot. Going to have to stop, though, I figured I'm going to be a wide, wide humanish whale thing if we keep eating there the same frequency. I was planning on starting to run this week, but not with the zarking snow, no way. Snow and rain is not conducive to me running anywhere, except perhaps to run out of the rain/snow.   I have to get my sleep schedule back to semi-normal. Seriously. I would like to run, not feel dog ass tired, maybe go for a swim ocasionally, and, perhaps, even go out during the daytime.   Send me Haikus! Thanks to freaks for contributing, I was very happy when i saw them on the comments thingy. Ugh. Kurt just told be he wouldn't care if i turned into a largeish whale person. That's niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice. Well, sort of, but ew, i think. I did not like previous Robyn Roundness, and, as a matter of fact, there are several points where I find meself a little too squishy as is. Of course, it's been high school since i did anything to combat said squishy on a regular basis, so, I have no call to complain.   I will not become squishier. I will not become squishier. I will not eat pizza stuff alll day long. I will not drink pop for every thirsty instance, I will jog, or do something reasonably active three times a week. I will not become squishier, even though Kurt won't mind a bit, I will not become squishier. I will not eat garbage. I will not shed all over the place, and puke up stomach acid at five am...ok, well, those last three are what I would like Lucas' resolutions to be. Somehow, I doubt he'll give up his vices, though.

      Logically now, why would my blog keep disappearing? Is it possible the damn thing is allergic to virtually non-existant html skills?  Anyways, drank last night. Not exactly heroic amounts, but enough that the world indeed had a pleasant, fuzzy feeling to it. Paid for said indiscretion today, though. Not hangovers; hardly ever get them, but sometimes I get alcohol-induced paranoia, so i was a big ol' ball of live nerves today. Luckily, I didn't have to explain this to Kurt, he too was on an edge. Nothing that can't be cured with time and sleep though. It's one of the myriad reasons I do not drink often.   Dave vamoosed today, I'm feeling a little guilty, because of the sleep scheduling thing, he spent a lot of time playing video games with Kurt. They got along wonderfully, of course, but I felt that he could have easily taken offense at me ignoring him, or Kurt could have taken offense at me pawning off people to him to entertain. So, I spent as much time with him as  I could, then took a nap when i realised I had asked three seperate times what a mutual friend was doing work-wise. "He's a contractor............He's a contractor........................................he's a CONTRACTOR."  We spent a lot of time giggling like idiots in the bar, I  also think he really liked the Merry Band of Tards. (Who doesn't?) Today, I didn't see him before he left, as I didn't fall asleep until 12 or so. That would be pm. Argh.  Oh heeeeeeeey, got a call from a pizza place yesterday, tomorrow I have an interview. Yay! I like working in kitchens, they feel like home to me. Grandmother and Granfather had a resturant when I was a wee pup, so, there's something comforting about pizza ovens, deep fryers, BIIIIIGGG mixers, etc. It is not an Adult job. Well, it is, but it is not a Career Endeavor. Ok, well, it is for some, certainly, and I'm very pleased, but it feels out of tune with the jobs I've been applying for lately. But, I am proud to get called for a job there, in my opinon it is the BEST pizza place possibly anywhere, and I get (you know, if i get the job) to make these truly above par pizza pies. Plus, it's a job where a body makes stuff, so it'll be up there on the job satisfaction. The downsides are possibly smelling like fast food all the time, weird hours, and the possibility of being there all the time; the hours range from 30-60 a week. There's also the coping fear, I would be actually interacting with people all day long, and doing fairly hard work (They are the best, after all, they're busy people). So, send me mojo pretty please, that I get the job, and that I have the cojones and ability to keep the job.    many beers were drank and lots of friends were dancing Scotskins make us fat

      I've gone over the deep end in the job search; it's gotten to the point of applying for jobs that I have no real skills or experience for, simply because I think I'd be good at them, or that they're interesting. Well, both, actually. The newest victim is the position of Building inspector. As a resident of this town for a long while, i can safely attest that the shit that landlords pull off is obscene. The standard of living, in particular if you happen to be a student, is moderately appalling. And, I do know that there are a lot of dead beat land lords making life difficult for students and otherwise uninformed individuals.  Nocturnalism continues, looks like i'm just gonna have to stay up for the big two four to flip it on back, thing is I can't seem to ever do it; I start to vomit around noon or so. Time was, I was able to stay up for days on end without feeling an overt amount of ill effects, but alas, those days are passed, and I'm a big fricken wimp. Largish squishy whiny person. Whatever.  My ex-roomie has hair. This should not sound extraordinary, but Dave was a strict adherant to the Ways of The Shorn; he never had hair grow past 3 cm in the years that I've known him. Today promises to be interesting, as long as i manage to keep Lunch in the tummy, but before the guys get up, I'm going to give er one more attempt at sleeping.  Please God, if you're reading, knock me out with your divine skillet, and allow me at least four hours of uninterupted repose. Pretty please?  My ass be dog tired I can't sleep the night through, ever Cranberry juice sucks

      Being nocturnal is truly excellent if you're an owl. If you're me, it's moderately amusing with a side of terrible annoyance. The plus side is now I have a computer, an 64][, a playstation, and a moderate selcetion of channels, so it beats the hell out of insommnia in the past when i had none of these things. Spent a lot of time walking, as i recall. Lucas, in retrospect, was much skinnier then, but more confused. When the weather was inclement, I'd occasionally dress up in old prom dresses and sing (softly) tunes, and dance around, or play with magnetic poetry till the sun came up. Later on, when I had an apartment with a tub, I took many baths, complete with mask and snorkel. (Do NOT knock it, unless you try it.) Now I conquer, attempt to get black and white to work, whimper when it doesn't, watch pirated movies, download music, talk to people on icq, play games, watch late night buffy, and surf. Pointless things, I suppose, but time enjoyed at least somewhat, is not wasted time.  Many and much mojo goes to hiccup as she plods through the rest, and the last of her term. Hiccup, you're doing great, hauling your tired ass all through.But, when this is over, for the love of Trogdor, take a break, and stare at your navel for a bit. Much love, you whiny freak.  Feedback, people, I need feedback! Am i boring you to tears? Is there something you'd like to see me write about, or discuss? Want to tell me to take more prozac and get a grip? Let me know. Like it says on the border there, there is a lot of times where I feel like I'm in a pink floyd song, you know, when I'm not in a Jethro Tull song. (Everybody's on the stage and it seems you're the only person sitting in the audience...can't remember the tune's name, but sums me up nicely.) And hey, you can even send me haikus...remember, the format is 5 syllables, then 7, then 5 again, no rhyming necessary. They're really fun, for nerds like me, anyways. I'm working myself up to eventually post limericks.  Speaking of which:  Kurt is horking snot Phelgm has invaded his head and it's all my fault  Kurt is truly suffering. His fault, I figure, he was the one who maintained that he NEVER gets sick. See, now, where I come from, you simply don't make claims such as these, because, we all know that the Powers that Be, Fate, or God, (depending on affiliation), get a fair amount of amusment demonstrating to you that "never" is just not a realistic concept.    War. HUH...what is it good for? Absolutely nothing...SAY IT AGAIN...

      My heart nearly stopped yesterday, when a car hit a snowbank outside my house. I was frozen, on the couch, scared to death that I or Kurt had let Lucas outside. Lucas is not an adventurous person, he goes outside, he pees, he returns. On warm, sunny days, he alternately suns himself and rests in the shade. He by and large avoids the road, but in that second, I thought of how Cordy was one puppy length from the driveway.  Lucas was inside. And since, he doesn't go out by himself any more. Not because I don't trust him, but because I don't trust others. Not on our street. Tomorrow, I call the Town Office, and the police station to see if something can be done before another pet gets injured, or dies, or, even worse, a child. There's a condo complex just across the way, after all. To my knowledge, no human has been hit by the hurtling cars, but, it's better to close the barn door before the horses run out.  Granger is the editor of my resume, she re-formatted it, and gave me purty paper. Tomorrow is the day I attempt the Editorial Assistant job, armed with the purty paper and the new professional polish. I almost feel I have to buy a new outfit or soemthing to sucessfully offset the new look.

      Again with the bleeeccchhh. Still sicky, still concerned about the Late Night Phone Call, and I feel as though I really ought to stay away from books I know will stir my righteous ire. Right now, the literary culprit is "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore, the duder that brought about the movies "Roger and Me" and "Bowling for Columbine". Moore is brilliant, pithy, and has me convinced the world is going to hell in a handbasket, with the US being the chief weight of said handbasket. (Sorry Komnith, but your country is entirely un-sane)  Passed out resumes today: Two bookstores, two restuarants, and a re-application for the Infamous Baker job. I managed to apply last time, but, alas, did not get hired. The job is open again, so again I trooped on in, gave them another copy of my resume, and now the waiting begins. There's a larger sized job I'm going to apply for tomorrow, that of Editorial Assistant. I'd be good at it, I'm sure, but I've not any experience in a publishing house. But man, oh man, this is indeed something that is of Career status, so i'm not going to let silly underexperience stop me, oh no sirree.  I entirely missed St. Pat's this year. Peculiar, usually i head somewhere to get the irish groove on, but this year i had no idea even what day it was. Best St. Pat's was two years ago, Pol, Hee Soo, and other assorted Canadians and Koreans boogied the night away at the James Joyce. Hee Soo got kissed, something the rest of us found hilarious, and Hee Soo found it, well, disturbing. Especially since the kisser had questionable hyigene, and was a man about forty years Hee Soo's senior. Gratitude, we all discovered that evening, goes a long way.

      I'm still up at this, the golden hour of five, because I was a reciepient of a disturbing phone call.You know the one, the 2.30am one that stops your heart, and makes you wonder which member of the planet that you love has slid off. Lucky for me, it wasn't one of those calls. Instead, it was a call from someone who felt like she really ought to slide off. I spoke to her for two hours. I am more concerned about her now than I was before the phone call, worried that I somehow made things worse for her. Maybe not, though, certainly, from her view, things can't get all that worse. I know she thinks about killing herself a lot. She's a lot like how I am that way, thinking she is a burden to all, that her lot in life is to shut up and deal. She has shut up and dealt with a lot, losing her father to cancer when their relationship was just starting to be a good one, her husband getting cancer twice,  her husband getting into a car accident that broke his spine, she raised two kids, and for a long time was  the sole breadwinner in her family. Her kids never wanted for anything, they turned out pretty nice, but I'm not entirely sure she's ever been happy. She wants her Dad back, she wants a reason to quit drinking every night, and no one seems capable of giving her that reason.   What can be done? What can anyone do? Is there anything? Hope and pray and love her, somehow, that doesn't seem enough.  There really does seem to be a metric ton of garbage everywhere sometimes. Nothing fits, nothing seems right. Kurt often uses this negativity as a testament to God; he says we're like babies, in the womb, with lungs. The feelings of everything sucking is our lungs, and is proof that here, on this wild and weird mudball, isn't where we're supposed to be. That gives the garbage purpose, and i must say, it's a damn sight better theory than that whole "The Lord is testing us" crap. I've always hated that, and the other, equally trite and annoying sentiment of "We don't know God's mind...he works in mysterious ways" Yeah, I know. Definitely don't want to hear that when a tragedy happens, though.  I know, though, and this is really deep down, buried under a bunch of crap, but I know that there are amazing, beautiful hopeful things about this place that, if not make the garbage worthwhile, at least makes an attempt to balance it. And, I do really think God is the master oppourtunist, he finds ways of turning crap around, almost always, if you come to think about it. I mean, I can look all over my life and see the slime, but all that slime has made me who I am, showed me my friends, gave me Kurt, and Lucas, and showed me what family means. That's a least quasi miraculous, eh?  Well, enough highlighting the garbage inherent in my life. It's Haiku time.  Five in the morning Another night passes by Candy makes me fat

       urlLink    A fish, a carp to be exact, was found the other day spouting Hebrew apocalyptic warnings. A few days ago, The Vatican reported that they had lost the keys of Heaven given to St. Peter, by Jesus Christ. There also was an issue about a week ago about a statue of Mary having too-prominent nipples. By these three things, I would assume that the end is near, in particular with the advent of that new reality show where the US picks a contestant's future mate.  Had dinner at East Side Marios this evening, although, truly, the monies accrued must be better spent than on food and books. However, I can rationalize and say: It's been a long time since either of us relaxed about anything. Although we aren't exactly relaxing at present, shouldn't we give it a try? Besides, on Monday, we go make appointments to get our eyes checked...soon we must pay rent and other crap.. might as well do fun things while the getting's good. Or is that completely irresponsible? I can never tell.  Definitely in a strange headspace. That restless feeling is back, and I feel homesick, but I don't know where I'm homesick for, my parents, or the house I grew up in, or maybe just a time where there was a lot let to worry about and a lot less to be tired from. I'm not sure, of course, if that time ever actually occured.

      Ahh, thank heavens....we're back.  Sorry Chad, that I missed you before you headed off to Germany, everybody, give Chad mojo so he doesn't complicate his life further (He's a walking Seinfeld episode) and also, we'll need some non-terrorist mojo, just in case. Although, my fist thought is: Who would attack Germany?   Kurt's come down with the GluelikeSnot Illlness, and after some over-stepping my bounds yesterday, I to, am sicker. It's nice to be sick together, pasing the vapo rub and the orange juice, moaning and wailing our body's aches.   So, as I again, slept all day in the hopes of recovering, I am, again, without anything new to report.

      And, pouf! everything's fixed.  I think it's might be a matter of hanging on through the nasty bits, but screaming, yelling and generally flipping out does happen to pass the time. The miracle this time around was that we have recieved checks from Student Loan, for dear kurt's edamacation, and we're back on the positive side of the bank balance. For now. *insert spooky music and a bank teller laughing her orange lips off.*    And now for something completely different. Well, no, not as such. When I can't write for some odd brain block or another, I write about how hard it is to write. This little excerpt was for a creative writing portfolio from arandom year at uni; can't remember when, but I thought it was sort of funny. Just think, perhaps, someday, I'll post something I wrote that is less than two years old.   All I want to write are love stories.  I�m blocked, suffering from a verbal constipation that possibly only God and his Host can lift from my mind and fingers. I�ve been trying to think for months of something to write, something meaningful, pithy, humorous. Imbued in its hallowed characters, a noble Truth that I benevolently bestow on my Dear Avid Reader. But the thing is, all I want is for Buffy and Angel to stay together, for Romeo to have a little more gosh-durned patience, and for my sister to stop dating Goths, and get herself a guy who will treat her right, and not want to suck her blood.  I�ve been listening to sad songs, I�m drawn perversely to teenage melodrama, I�ve considered contacting old boyfriends, just to chat. I�m not in love right now. Sometimes (but only sometimes) I wonder if I ever was.  Maybe I want to write about love, because, well, because I�d make for damn sure they�d end happily, with the Little Mermaid doing the dishes, Romeo picking the kids up after school, and Petrarch and Laura renting a video together on a Saturday night, all pictures of domestic bliss. Domestic bliss. Is that a lie? False advertising? A myth? Fairytales? Is it even a goal, worthy of one�s ardent pursuit? (armed with charm and wit and sex appeal) What is it, I wonder, that twists my mind, and others as well, to find this Person, this shining paragon of similar interests, amicable behavior, interesting and diverting conversation, among other attributes. Scads of literature, art and music are devoted to the timeless themes of Boy-Meets-Girl, Boy-Loses-Girl. Variations are rampant. The boy can meet the girl, boy can meet another girl, gets distracted, ended up losing the first girl, who was, really, in fact, his true love, but this first girl find her true love in Mary, the Girl Down the Street. Boy finally finds Mary and Girl A in a sordid mess of sheets and sweat, and in a jealous rage, joins a nudist colony, and writes somber country songs for the remainder of his existence. Or something like that. Doesn�t help me, I�m still blocked worse than a toilet in an all-boys residence during frosh week, full of shit, and vomit. If I had another set of eyes, I�d roll them at myself.  It seems to me as though the entire Universe, including my poor, tired, mediocre brain is absolutely insisting that I write nothing but spurious crap till the final trump. I�ll be sitting next to the singing William fucking Shatner in limbo. And, that guy who wrote the song �I�m Gonna Write You the Ultimate Love Song,� No, wait. I�m pretty sure both those guys will be burning in the lake of fire for their atrocities. I�ll be next to Michael Bolton, and the writer of The Celestine Prophecy. No, they�ll be going to hell, too. I guess it�ll be me and the scores of writers who suck, but have fallen short of infernal reward.

      Holy Hell.   Kurt went a-way to purchase some insurance, and returned some hours later with no newly purchased insurance because the powers that bank put a hold on our joint checking account. Our insurance expires the fifteenth. The reasoning behind this is because I had some student loan payments that I had neglected to make. I neglected to make them because there has been horrendous unbalances in what i supposedly owe, and reality. For example, last summer i got a student loan of 7000 dollars, although i wasn't in school at the time, and didn't actually get a loan. Also, the semester before that, i applied for a student loan, and didn't get one, because I didn't apply, although i swear those hours in front of the computer were not hallucinations. Then, there was the stupid interest relief form, and I think I'll skip talking about that, although that pretty much brings us to where we're at now - my mom and I (Yes, my mom has got my back, there's nothing better) have been embroiled in red tape stupidity for a long time, and the mail that goes to mom's gets forwarded to me in big chunks, and i know i should have kept up with my correspondance with the banks and student loans, but i didn't because there seemed to be a lot going on in reality, and a lot of the same weird red tape bullshit going on in The Bank Dimension, so, like a good me, I thought "There is no problem that is so big it cannot be ignored indefinitely." Uh, yeah, right. Moves in the correct direction are going thusly: tomorrow my mom gets on the horn on my behalf, i start scaring up some forms that prove I haven't been entirely sane, and that's why my university school record looks like a mighty hunk of swiss cheese, and a lot of praying that the money gets magically unthawed by the 15th, or you know, trouble. That is to say, more trouble. Of a different sort. Yikes.   Which brings me to an interesting side note: While Kurt and i were running around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to make insurance payments, little did we know that we were insured for sweet buptkiss after november, because the car had been out of province for so long. It is pecuilar that AMA never actually mentioned this to us, but kept on blithely telling us to pay up due to our contractual obligations.   I think I've had enough. I recognize that this is part an parcel of being a grown up adult person, but the effect of getting penalized for honesty, for having to remove my nanny experience because it's dead weight on my resume as being unskilled labour, not getting hired to pay off student loans, but unable to go back to school to complete said education because of student loans. It's all insane. There's nothing remotely resembling peace in this little spot, at least, not yet. I think right now, i could definitely handle a dead end job for a while, as long as the bills were getting paid regularily, and we could go out to a movie every now and then, and maybe i could even buy a vacuum cleaner that works. Of course, said dead end job would be ideally something that didn't cause my hair to go gray, or to experience nervous nausea, but i think i'd be willing to make a few exceptions.   I miss Cordy.

      So, this morning, in a moment of clarity, I asked Kurt to phone the Family for an update as to my job status. I lost it. I lost my job, the job has been misplaced, the job is no longer my concern. There is an overwhelming sense of being penalized for doing the right thing, however, I can see from their viewpoint how I must've been a bad bet. Retrospectively, I believe they had no intentions of keeping me on, why else interview others after my insurance problem had beeen solved?  Another reason I can't really blame them is that I really was a bad bet. I was planning on taking my leave of them as soon as greener pastures materialised in the form of a job in town, or better pay, or both. I guess the thing is, I wasn't planning on leaving the job on their terms; I had planned to leave on mine.  There are a few postings on job bank that look tasty - a long time to hear back, but tasty nonetheless. After I am healed, and my voice returns, I'm going to drop off resumes at resturants here, compose killer cover letters for other non-food-service jobs, and keep all of my digits crossed. To be honest, though, I feel completely demoralised. There seems to be a somewhat unending succession of bad luck in the job market thing, and it's beginning to occur to me that it ISN'T bad luck, but either that A) I suck, or that B) I suck. Or perhaps C) The entire world sucks, and I am its bitch.   Basically, for the last year or so, I've been trying to get myself a little niche in the world of work. I quit most of my endeavors, for what I thought were reasonable and solidly good reasons. Could it be that they weren't? It could be the case that I am deficient in work ethic, or I'm too picky, or something. Or it could all seem that way because I have this tendancy to see events in the worst possible lighting.    Today's job posting goes thusly:  Title: Project administration officer (Coordinator)   Terms of Employment: Temporary, Full Time Salary: $10.00 Hourly for 32.5 hours per week  Anticipated Start Date: As soon as possible   Location: Another Commute of thirty minutes or so for me   Other Information: TERM: 42 weeks. Ability to provide administrative support for facilitators & program manager. Excellent keyboard skills & computer skills including MSOffice & database. Organizational & communication skills. Detail oriented. Ability to work in a fast paced, constantly changing environment. Interpersonal skills. An understanding of Priority/At Risk Youth.  Employer:Centre for Small Business & Entrepreneurship How to Apply:  	By Fax:  	By E-mail:  	Other: Deadline: March 21, 2003    Any ideas with the cover letter and suchlike would be greatly apperciated; I'll be bashing away at that for the part of the day I'm not asleep trying to purge myself of the Wold's Stickiest Illness.   That's it for now, it's now naptime for the sick. No, I haven't seen a doctor. Either it's viral, and they can't do anything, or I'll be contributing to the world's supervirus problem with antibiotics.

      Enjoy the silence For I still can't speak out loud Being sick sucks my ass.   But that's no reason to be un-haiku about it...  I am coughing a lot, but, no trout; at least, not yet. It's funny, I actually feel better but my outward symptoms seem worse. I am, however, fricken exhausted; coughing up one's internal organs is not an endeavor to be taken lightly. And, speaking of lightly, my head's floating about six inches above my neck. I'm going to have to write more later, because, well, because.

      oh my GAWD. My voice is now completely gone, my ears keep on getting all stuffy and weird, so i have to do that weird jaw moving thing to unplug them, (think cow meets cud) and that generic nyquil stuff may be just causing me to have visions...visions of kicking Jacen's honky ass all around town. Then again, he's not in town, so I might have to forgo the ass kicking. The nighttime cold/flu relief comes in a noxious "cherry" flavor. Yeah, cherry with a side of bitter death. It's awful, and it doesn't quite work, as i should be asleep right now, healing away, but instead, I'm awake, light headed and funky smelling. (the stuff had nothing to do with that; when I'm sick, i dislike being damp.) And yet, I have this strange compulsion to drink more of it, you know, because maybe in a higher dose it will work, and not make me feel like a cartoon. But it tastes bad, and I couldn't possibly deal with more light headedness.  So, in Chicago, i really noticed that the actors were beyond skinny. Rene Zellewigger had no breasts; Catherine Zeta-Jones' typically lovely curvy body was emaciated. I hope that it was because of the rigours of dancing or something, and they aren't planning on staying that way, because the sight of dancing skeletons is particularily vivid after seeing the show, and, well, drinking Cherry Flavored Generic Death In A Bottle. Keeping on the same tangent, Queen Latifah is a hot, hot woman. Like, smokin' hot.  There were times, however, I really thought she was in danger of smothering in her own breasts.  Finished reading a Terry Practchett novel; it was good, read like a Douglas Adams on anphetamines. It was funny, and made sense after a fashion, and I have no doubt I'll forget every single solitary thing about it in two weeks time. I liked how it was written, but it was so ornate that it may have overwhelmed my brain. Will have to read more, and this one again to make individual images and events stick.  This is madness. I think, perhaps, I'll go to a doctor later today. Or not. I saw my doctor last semester more than I saw one of my buddies here. That can't be a good sign. Then again, neither are any of these symptoms that have persisted for five days. Eh. We'll see when I regain consciousness the next time, i suppose.

      I lost my voice today, so now I sound like Ron Weasley in the second Harry Potter when it works, and Whispery Rob when it doesn't. There's a lot of croaking involved as well. There's no pain involved, so i enjoy it. I like funny voices.  I saw Chicago last night; it was truly splendid. Dark without being brooding, funny, cynical, and a-fricken-mazing to watch; I can see why people are attracted to plays, musicals, and shiny things that dance. It was pretty ugly in places, too. It sort of makes you realise how everything is for sale, even, especially justice. I kept thinking that little has changed from the time period of the movie and now. Better lawyers go to better paying customers.   Still haven't heard from the Family as to job status.   I'm taking this generic nyquil stuff to promote sleep, so, in theory, I'll heal quicker. Seems to me, though, that while it does assure a four hour bout with unconsciousness, it also promotes the dreaming of dreams that are even weirder than my norm. For example, last night, I went to sleep thinking about Chicago, and i awoke sort of holding a potato scrubber shaped cleverly like a potato that Catherine Zeta-Jones had given me. Then I really woke up and wondered why the hell i was dreaming about potato scrubbers in the first place. There was also a dream where I pulled an entire trout out of my mouth. You know that grossness when you're sick and you hork up phelgm? See, that was the plan, but i horked up a smallish sized trout instead. Perhaps my sub-conscious was hungry at the time.   Everyone's been talking about the war/police action. I've little to say about it, except, the sooner people realise that those in power are liars and murderers, the better. Kurt is right; fear sells, and we've got to be AFRAID of those big bad people who happen to have their thumbs on the oil.Nevermind the fact that we'd be fighting against folks the US armed in the first place. Anyways, shut off your damn TV, neither you, me or the guy down the street is getting even an eighth of the information we ought to be getting in order to make an inofrmed judgement call on whether we should go to war or not. I say not, but that's a generality; War is hell, anyone who says differently is selling something.

      Ahhh, sucess! now you all can comment on my crap if you're so inclined, and I have a handy dandy little hit counter, so I can see how popular I am. Still haven't figured out how to post links, though, I suppose, eventually I'll have to learn HTML or some such, but not right now. As it stands, all the interesting links will go in as something you can cut and paste.  Thanks to Chad for introducing me to Grovestand apple juice. For the record, I hate apple juice. Looks like pee, I don't like how it smells, it seems sticky, and unless it's ice cold, tastes moderately disgusting.Not as disgusting as, say, Ribena, but a foulness all its own. But not this stuff. Try it, it's tropicana, they make good juice. Be warned, however, the stuff's the color of earwax. And the consistancy of tomato juice.  A haiku for today:  Sexy yellow dog Shedding fur all over the place Lucas is moulting.  I need a new vaccum. I have a glorified dustbuster, and all it really seems to do is re-distribute the dog fur to other sections of carpet. Had access to the Shop Vac for a while, now that's cleaning POWER! God, I am such a housewife.  The following is an excerpt from a brief conversation with Fuzz, a fellow farker. I have a feeling I'll be using the pentultimate phrase frequently, so here is the offical first citing: Dorje Phamo says: yo Fuzz says: Hola Dorje Phamo says: sup? Fuzz says: Not much, week about to be very busy though Dorje Phamo says: sounds lovely Fuzz says: How goes on your end? Dorje Phamo says: aahh, lots of snots and boogers, but all right all-in-all Fuzz says: So, shits happening, but no diarhhea Dorje Phamo says: a perfect sentiment.  *note to Jeffy: Dorje Phamo means "The Thunderbolt Sow".   Supposed to hear back this weekend whether or not my honesty has cost me my job. Slight bitterness, with an incoming front of Ahhh-Well-Fuckit. The jobs on the job bank website are getting a little freaky though. I think, in the last three days, there has been as many ads for truckers. Time to get my class three, I reckon.  That's it, I'm going to return to drooling on my pillow and moaning about how I'm always sick. Or, maybe take a bath.

      it was not a snow day....damn it!  I was fiddling with the blog last night, and managed to not get last night's posted, erm, posted, so here i am, double posting away, all willy nilly...it could have been worse, I know someone who erased their whole blog by accident. His name ryhmes with "Jurt" So, haaaaahahaaha.  I met the kids grandaparents today, sweet folks, but man did i feel weird wandering around while they were there. I felt as thought I should have hightailed it out fast, but hey, i did want to get paid.  Nothing overtly exciting happened today; i was playing with kids and being all house keepy today. Oh, well, the Dad did ask me if i was an 'aspiring housewife' Ha ha ho har har. No. Why do i feel like i have to keep justifying my choice in this job? I didn't want to be out in public. I'd rather not be supervised; therefore child care is a marvellous answer. He seems to think that I'm doing this because that's all i can do, or something. Even if it was, it's still a lot, these weirdoes really want me took cook their food atop everything else - case in point, I baked a birthday cake for one of the kids. I'm not sure why it strikes me as odd, but I suppose part of it could be that one of my parents were always home.I can't imagine leaving my kids with a stranger eight hours a day, every day. The other thought is that The Dad sort of lets on that I'm a mom wannabe, like I'm practicing. Amongst these two vibes is the sense that he really tries to impress me with his intellectual prowess. Plllllllease. Why are you trying to impress your nanny/housekeeper? And, buddy, I'm not impressed that you teach grade ten, and don't believe novels are stimulating enough.  Agh. Anyways.  Thank goodness for the Saint. Was feeling like hell tossed into a freezer, than defrosted by microwave, and she fed me, and made me feel needed.

      [3/6/2003 11:54:48 PM | Robyn MacKrous] Today, on a very special clone high....   We got everything fixed, thanks to the graces of Kurt's freaky family. I'm very thankful, and marginally freaked out, and slightly worried for them, alothugh they did say that the monies given to us was 'rainy day money' and that we shouldn't be worried. So, i can keep my job, well, perhaps. I can keep my job after they interview somebody else, and if they decide that they like me more. See, I told them right away what the dealio was, so, the went off looking for another nanny straight away. That's fine, that's why I told them. But now, i feel very insecure in the job situation. At the same time, I also think the commute is a pain in the ass, and I'd dearly love a job right in town. Alas.   Well, that's it. i'm sick again, thank you kiddies, and i slept allllllllllllll day, so I'm rather short on anything new or exciting.   I hope tomorrow is a snow day.

Well, that's it. i'm sick again, thank you kiddies, and i slept allllllllllllll day, so I'm rather short on anything new or exciting.  I hope tomorrow is a snow day.

      and today, on a very special clone high....  Well, no.  I found out today that we may have to part with the civic, and in doing so, saying buh bye to the Family, as they live about a half hour away. Bloody insurance. Bloody moving across the fricken country. Bloody hell. I was thinking about the situation on the way home, and missed my exit. Bloody exits.  The deal goeth thusly: We're out of province, so AMA said go away, our term with them is up on March 15. To go to another insurerer here is not a wonderfully bright and shiny option; I had a case of extraordinary bad luck two years ago, and got into two fender benders in four months. Because of this, most insurance companies scream and run away when they hear me coming. This wouldn't be a problem, as I am a mere secondary driver, but alas, because of the job, I became the primary driver. After all, school is about a click and a half away, and I got meself a full-on commute. Bloody commutes.  So, it would appear that, no matter what, I must not be this prime driver in order to not be all expensive to insure and stuff. Kurt does all the other driving anyways, I don't know what the big is. And, I'm going to be penalized for my bad driving for another four years. So, I suck, the system sucks, and WHY do we have to change our plates and licences over?  Agh. Anyways, not such a bad scrape, really, but wildly agravating nonetheless. On top of the rent, the rings, the credit card, the food, the power, the other annoying ways that people want to get money from us. Well, at least I'm not pregnant.

      So, as of the last three days, I've had songs sung by kids in french stuck in my head. Since it's french, though, and I don't speak french, the soothing thing is that the songs can't stay there very long. The boys are all right, I'm sort of cranky, and that house is zarking cold. But, all in all, the work situation is satisfying. Still overwhelming to a certain extent...but easier to deal with than, say, retail.  Our lock was frozen last night. My poor Lucas, he waited for the usual nine hours for us to come home, then we didn't even walk in the door; we went away again. We came back to try again, and then Kurt came back, and still, no luck. Thanks to the lovely Misscriss, we got boiling water, dumped it over the lock, and then dried out the lock with a hairdryer. Misscriss also took us to pancakes at an aquaintence's house, and that girl makes the BEST pancakes on planet earth. That's right, the enitre globe. It worked out all right, but I was tired, and just wanted to bathe, I had little interest in pancakes, Kurt's and Sarade's endless discussions, but it was really nice to be out and about despite the fatigue.  Been thinking, over and over, that I need a career. Like i said, the job here doesn't suck, but more money is required, and I would, ideally, like something I can do for an extended period of time. At least, I think I want that. Or maybe, I want to want that.  A person died at Acadia a few days ago. (Let's call him CJ) I had a unique relationship with him, he stalked me for four months. Called 7+ times a day, came to my house at ANY hour, and was vaguely creepy. I had a like/creeped out feeling for him; he had a lot of brains, but they were skewed. Conspiracies were on his mind frequently. He was also delusional, he mentioned on several occasions that he was the decendant of the One and Only Jesus Christ, who did not, as popular thought would have it, die on the cross, but led a full and rich life with the reformed Mary Magdalene. Offical reports say that CJ died from exposure. He, evidently, went for a walk. He didn't drink, so I am sure he didn't pass out in a ditch. I am also sure, as are the authorities, that it was suicide. During my aquaintence with him, he had moments of clarity. During these, his depression was consuming. I have the sense that he had a little more than his average dose of clarity that night; but speculation is dumb; I'm just trying what everybody else is trying to do - explain.   I don't exactly miss him, exactly. He scared me on occasion, annoyed me on others. We did have some good talks. I remember him sitting in my kitchen, telling me that it was possible to overcome depression, as he did it himself, years ago. I remember him walking out of a classroom that required a little more computer lab time than was usual, and leaving a note on the prof's desk: "Machines don't give us grace." I remember not being able to sleep, and he'd come over at four am, because he saw my light on. I remember trying to get him to leave once by talking to another girl about feminine hygeine. He told me a lot about how the Vatican was entirely evil. I remember the few times he propositioned me. I remember him staring at my boobs. I remember him knocking on my door at least three times a day. (I should have been in class, but I was busy feeling vastly sorry for myself). I remember his obssession with the british military, and how that was the focal point of his existance; he wanted to be an elite assasin. He frequently told me how he'd go, have training, and come back to say hi, by ninjaing his way into my place, or dropping from a parachute while I walked to class. He would always dress in fatigues, green or camo, wore heavy black boots, had loooooooooooong hair, and a goatee. Maybe I should have realised that something was up when CJ, the warrior, cut off his hair.  No, I don't miss him, not exactly. But I am sorry he's gone, and I'm sorry he had no one to talk to about his hurt. I'm also sorry that his family said it was a relief he was finally gone. And I'm sorry that I feel a measure of relief that he's gone, even though his frequent communiques and visits had all but ceased when he discovered I had gotten married. I'm sorry the world wasn't a place he could better fit. And, of course, I'm sorry I wasn't as nice as I could have been to him, although that sentiment makes me sorrier; knowing what would happen to him would be the only reason I'd be kissing his ass.

      I think I figured out why I'm getting somewhat twitchy as of late, it's my first suicide attempt anniversary coming up on the ninth. Sick and sad that I remember maybe, but there you go. In honor, or whatever of this date, I'm going to post an essay I wrote after two suicide attempts, a slight psychotic episode, and after I shaved my head. Update to my state of mind after the essay.  It�s hard to explain sometimes, the worry, the  fever and the fret I feel. The boundless frustrations that may not have any basis in fact, but are as real to me as putting on my shoes. On days like this, it feels that every breath is bringing me closer to something awful, not death, because death would be a release, a sweet rest, an end to overwhelming grief. I tried to kill myself, on March 9th, 2000. I talked briefly to a good friend of mine. After I got off the phone, I poured myself a glass of water, set it on the toilet seat. I spread my St. John�s Wort, my Advil, and my paxil in neat little rows. I cried for my entire life then, a long time. I called another friend, got her machine, and apologized to it, and hung up. I picked up a pretty pink pill, and the orangey Advil, and thought to myself that it would get easier as I continued. It did. After those first two, it was as if the door had been thrown aside, and I could walk easily through it. I�m still not really sure why I phoned my parents. I believe it was to say goodbye, rather than a �cry for help�, since I believed I had all the help right there, in the form of pills and water. They talked me into calling 911. I listened to them. I phoned, and the voice on the other end told me they were sending police and ambulance. They asked me if I was going to attack anyone. I said no. The fat cops showed up first asked me a lot of questions. Why did you take your pills? Why tonight? What happened? Did you think it�d be fun? Why now? Why? Why did you call 911 if you wanted to die?  I cried a lot, most of my answers were �I don�t know.� It was true enough. I especially didn�t know why I called the ambulance. I couldn�t stop crying, and I cried all the way to the hospital, feeling idiotic, small, and hoping, wishing, that the pills I took would, at the very least, take my consciousness away. No such luck. I was wheeled into emergency, and spoke with a doctor that seemed almost bullied by me. I was released maybe an hour after I was admitted. I went back to my apartment, in a cab. And my friend was waiting for me, in tears. It is hard to explain clearly why I feel the way I do. I think maybe if I could, I wouldn�t feel like this anymore. I can describe it, though. It is a feeling of worthlessness. Each day that passes is the same as the one before it. Motivation to do anything is hard come by. Everything seems a fake, useless. All my best efforts turned to shit. Exerting myself to do the best work I could, to keep up social interactions, I couldn�t do. It seemed idiotic anyway. My concentration left me; I could not longer read. Or study, or write. I watched TV, I cried. I lost the ability to be responsible for myself. I was on a pill ration, and nothing stronger than Pepto Bismal was in my medicine cabinet. I�m staying with my family now. I flipped my sleep schedule over again, I sleep all day. I have no energy; I want to stop thinking about all I�m thinking. That I owe everyone money. I doubt I could hold down a job. My last academic year was almost a complete failure, and so has my entire life. I have nothing to look forward to, another meaningless year at university, then an entirely open future, where I have no resources to help myself.  	The second time around, I was determined not to repeat the mistakes I made the first time. This time, it was over 60 pills. Another trip to a brand new Alberta hospital. I only started crying when I realized I wasn�t going to die. I waited a while after I took the pills, waited, then went downstairs to tell my Dad I loved him. He knew something was up, and I got a trip.  The nurse told me about a boy who was admitted and lost his liver, and now will most likely die because of his OD, only now he doesn�t want to. I think I may have offered him my liver. My Mom was there with me, beautiful and fearless, and she wasn�t angry for my stupidity. The nurses drove an IV in my hand. I swallowed a tube, and tried not to gag. They ran water through, and encouraged me to �relax the back of your throat�. I forgot how to breathe through my nose, and the tube went so far down. I wanted to pull it out, but someone held my hands. It felt, at some points, that I wouldn�t be able to breathe at all. Tears and vomitus rolled into the bucket. Then, came the charcoal, a heavy black punch in the pit of my belly. They put a bin at my feet, in case I felt sick later.  I was sick later. Imagine chomping on barbecue briquettes, and washing it down with tar. Then, trying to throw it all up again. The weight of it caused a blood vessel in my eye to burst. I was astute enough to know that the charcoal was more of a deterrent than anything else was. The counselor I spoke with agreed with me, and remarked �It worked though, right? I bet you�ll never take an OD on pills again.� I managed to smile at her in agreement. The thing that was the same was the �Why� question. Everyone asked it. Of course if I had a nice, neat, answer , I�d probably be a more productive member of society. I wouldn�t be sick, I�d have it all figured out. THERE ARE NO NEAT ANSWERS. At least, not for me. I did discover an important fact, however. I do hate myself. I love life and air and all of that, but I guess I don�t believe I deserve it.  The next incident came because I was confused. I thought my mother was drinking and driving. And, she had a sixteen year old in the car with her. And they were driving, and it was all my fault, because I did not do the errand for my mother, and she went instead, and all I could picture was blood in my mother�s hair. I went for a walk to clear my head. When I had returned, my parents were looking for me.  I grabbed a knife, and scraped at my wrist. I could feel nothing except for despair. Then, it felt like I wasn�t there anymore, that some how I was watching myself do this, through my eyes, not feeling the little tiny rips as the knife pulled across my skin. I won myself another trip to the hospital. My mother was not so kind to me this time, however. I was a spoiled brat, that didn�t care about anyone. I spent the night under observation, wishing for all the world I could take back what I did, and make my mother love me. Or to die, and feel nothing. Nothing at all.  Cheery, huh?  Oy. I have the sense that being depressed is like a fucked up form of narscissicism. You can't get out of your head. Everything is your fault. Even if you weren't there, or had nothing to do with said shitty event, it was your fault. A few of my friends became ill in and around the same time I hit my low. For months I could not dismiss the feeling that I  was contagious; spreading ill feeling everywhere I went.  The thing that I didn't mention in that essay was my sister. She made the entire hellish experience bearable, and, in some instances, funny. She told off the nurses when my mom had an asthma attack; I think she also told one of them to shut up while they were telling me about Liver boy. She was allowed to come in and visit me in my isolated secure room. (No sharp edges, nothing in the room except a tub-like bed, and one blanket). She came in, drug a chair over, and sat next to me. She didn't say anything for a long time, and then burst into song. The song was the uplifting "Sit on My Face (And Tell Me That You  Love Me)" by Monty Python. This example of completely indecorous behaviour made me laugh til I threw up again, which wasn't a terrifcially long time.  I thought the hospital stay was hell, but in fact, I think there's nothing worse than being a failed suicide attempt. For a while, that was my entire self. I was the person who couldn't get my act together well enough to do something as simple as ending my life. My parents were living in fear of what I would do next. One of my best friends ditched my ass, telling me he wasn't ready to deal with me. We tried to be friends later on, after all the shit went down, but I lost respect for him as a caring human being, and he lost respect for me, feeling I was an idiot, and a weakling. Another friend of mine knew everything that happened, and refused to talk to me about it, or anything resembling depression. That summer, of the hospital trips, the headshaving, and the rest she never called once to see how i was. I was too ashamed to call her. When we were back in the same comunity, she made like nothing happened. When I tried to explain, to talk about it, she lost patience with me. She went on to alienate another friend of hers for the same reason. Both me and the other friend were 'too depressing' to be around.  I look back on it now, and I think those "friends" can lick my ass. And, I also think "Thank God for my friends that were there." Also, I'm grateful beyond belief for my family; without them, I'd be deader than Jacob Marley, and I heard he's as dead as a doornail.   I also look back, and think that I'm not nearly far away from that mindset as I would like, but perhaps further than I think. At least I hope so.  The conditioned response of the charcoal still affects me; I find it very hard to take any pills, and even the smell of tylenol makes me want to hurl.

      Went to Granger's last night with the girl's; a good idea all around, it keeps on occuring to me when I'm Out in a Social Situation that really don't go out much at all. And I hate the thought of going out. And, when I'm out, I don't hate it nearly as much as I thought I would, in fact, I rather like it. But, to quote the famous commerical, my get up and go got up and left.   Yeah.. I'll write more later, as my brain just shut off completely.

      So, i fell asleep around nine pm last night for all you 'normal' people, and woke up at midnight, remembering to go get a comforter out of the laundry room. As I walked down my stairs and onto my lawn, I hear someone call my name, and it's Herr Landlord. He looks like hell, his boots are unlaced, he doesn't look all that clean, nor does it look like he slept in a long time. He tells me about being eight thousand in debt, owing to incometax, the mortagage on his house, and his various financial difficulties. He's standing particularily close to me, I don't smell alcohol, but there is an overwhelming urge to run, kick at him, or kick at him, then run. I tried to extract myself from the conversation several times, and he asked me if Kurt was home. I told him he was at work, and my anxiety shot up -  he knew I was by myself. Lucas stayed really close, and that was moderately comforting. I know he wasn't trying to come on to me, or anything; he seemed extremely pitiable, but I was down right freaking scared. He repeated himself a lot, and repeated the phase 'I don't know what I'm going to do,'  I feel bad for the guy. But, I got my comforter, knocked on the Girls Downstairs' door, and asked to come in. I told them what happened, and how I felt pretty irrational, and they were not only sympathetic; they were nervous with him around. One of the girls saw him about around quarter to twelve, standing in the doorway of the laundry rooms, and looking, it seemed, in each window. She stood there, watching him watching the windows, for about ten minutes. He didn't move. When I knocked on the door about a half hour later, they weren't going to open the door; they thought I was him. I stayed with them until I heard Kurt come home. The Girls Downstairs told me about seeing porn on his computer when they went to pay the rent, and how he stops his truck in the middle of the road to talk to them. They can't put their finger on why he's creepy (besides the porn, and the aforementioned porn making inquiry) but they repeated what he had said to me earlier - that they don't know what he's going to do, or is capable of doing. Are we all alarmists?

      greetings and salutations.   bad belly maambajaamba, I feel all roly poly and pizza filled. it's okay though, as long as I don't look down. I have to clean out the fridge; I'm pretty sure that there is a functioning microecosystem in there. There's something vaguely liquidy happening, and I thought I heard little high pitched voices when I opened the fridge. I could crakc a mold joke here, but I'd imagine that you've already seen that angle coming, so I'm just going to say NO.  All the University people are gone, so the town is already five ziiiiiiiiiiiiiillllllllllllion times quieter. There are still asshats bombing through our street, but the cops have been lurking lately, and that is certainly all right by me. We're half assedly looking for a new place, out of the university scene, we've had enough of psycho neighbours yelling at four am, the parties, and the occasional drunken fuck who comes knocking on our door looking for someone else. (OOOHHHh...and ditching the Herr and Frauline Landlord) I am fully aware that psychos will be there no matter where we go; however, I do think there are quieter places we could be, and places with less traffic, and, you probably guessed it; there are definitely places with less mold.  Lucas is still being stubborn with the functions bodily. I plan to take a watch next time he decides he just can't hold it anymore, and time how long he pees for. It seems like he pees for an extraordinary length of time, but I like to be objective about such things.  I feel like I am entirely out of sync with the world. I sleep in four hour shifts; I'm up, not to mention asleep, at eccentric hours, I don't see very many people, and I haven't been in touch with family or friends in what seems like months. It has the effect of making me feel my lifestyle as of late is terribly unhealthy, and, at the same time, it feels eminently comfortable. There's always the sense of sleeping in, there's the familiarity of being in a routine, and when I do get a chance to speak to someone from the Outside, it's a special privledge. Clearly, a life of incarceration is ideal for me. Now...what crime to commit?

      Oy. I've got some kind of headache happening here, which may be a symptom of staying up too late, or drinking Ceasars. Or, hey, it could be both. Was told tonight as soon as I want full time hours, Lunkhead's off like a prom dress; Pizza Mama said she's had just about enough of his shit. I am an usurper, and all i can think is 'hey. that's cool.'   Spent Quality Time at work with Pizza Mama, and the newish girl i will call The Muppet; she's great. Very dry, flat sense of humor, stunning personality, and a phone voice that could qualify her as an operator for Victoria' Secret. A good time was had by all.  Kurt is offically done his first year University, and he is being courted by the Philosophy department to be a major.   Lucas is still keeping up his bodily protest; he hasn't pooped since the Poop of Power, nor has he peed since yesterday. I have the nearly overwhelming urge to squeeze the relief right out of him, but there's the thought that I'd traumatize him. It took an awfully long time to get rid of the submission pee in the first place; there's no need to go back down that road.  Yeahhh huh, I'm a boring, boring, boring person. Work sleep, video games, repeat. Occasionally, laundry and a bit of assorted nonesense too, but lately, yeah, my schedule has been beyond simple.  I did have a thought today, though, why is it that when men get together for an extended period of time in a semi or completely coerced situation, they seem to aah, well, 'turn gay?' I've got a few people I know in jail, and, evidently, the amount of homosexual activity is extraordinary. Another interesting point is that one is only 'gay' if on the recieving end of such attentions. My hunchy theory thingy is that men, as a gross, sweeping generalisation, lack sexual restraint. That is not to say they lack control, and are merely rutting animals, but there is a perchant for promiscuity, or seems to be. Kurt and I talked it over, and his response that it was plausible, and he also added that it seems that women may lack a restaint as well; a social restraint. Backstabbing, gossiping, generally stepping on one another to get ahead, that seems to be the case for females. Comments?

      Reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintence'. A friend of mine lent it to me in high school, and I tossed it aside, largely because I found it blathery and it wasn't a story. Almost ten years later, and it is still largely blathery, and it isn't much of a story, but it does make some interesting commentary on philosophy life, the universe, you know, everything.  Keeping my schedule close to being a wompire from tronsilwania. It feels okay, but I'm frequently alarmed that I'm keeping this schedule because I'm relapsing or some such. I'm not, just working until midnight or later is conducive to sleeping obscene amounts of time during the day.   Lucas has been extremely pouty since the Lockdown. For the last three days or so, he has put up a fine mental block, and refuses to relieve himself at all. It's like he's embarassed or something. Last night, around four, Kurt and i took him for a walk, and he finally unclenched his bowels, and in twenty minutes went number 2 five times. It was an extraordinary display of the stubborness inherent in my dog. I hope he doesn't make it a habit and cause himself internal injury.  Why do i keep on having dreams about losing my teeth?  Spring is here; there's peepers at night, there's snow melting during the day, and there's signs of greenness. Thank God, this winter was going on far too long. Besides, I need a tan.

      Woke up this morning (read 2.00pm). you know those mornings (afternoons), the ones where first you're afrid you're going to die; then you're afraid you aren't. Wasn't sure where the putressence was going to shot out from, and the headache, well, my eyes are still making creaking noises. I'm going back to bed momentarily. And, this is possibly the first time EVER I felt truly upset for calling in sick. I was thinking how I'd miss being down talking philosophy and pizza with Mama, improving the pizza technique, and generally feeling at home. Still, being extremely close to a toilet was beneficial.  I bet it was the mold. As soon as I'm fully conscious, and feeling Up to the Challenge, I'm going to Trisodium Phophate the fun right out of it/them. I also noticed today that there is mold growing in the toilet as well. I'm zarking well surrounded.  I bonked myself in the head with the wooden pizza shovel the other day. I was alone in the kitchen, being all ninja-y. I attempted to swing the shovel  from behind me, over my head to slam it down on the prep table, and it did, after I bounced it off my head. I'm glad it wasn't the metal pizza shovel, I figure it would have been a few stitches.    I'd write a haiku, but I'm way too tired. Good Night/morning.

      "I was over in Australia during Easter.. Interesting to know that they celebrate Easter the same way we do: commemerating the death and resurrection of Jesus by telling our children that a giant bunny rabbit left chocolate eggs in the night. Now.. I wonder why we're fucked up as a race. Why not say something like goldfish left lincoln logs in your sock-drawer? At least a goldfish dragging a lincoln log across the room and putting it in a sock drawer has miraculous connonations."  "Look! There's a lincoln log in my sock drawer! That's the story of Jesus." -Bill Hicks   Happy Easter.  Kurt and I were both off today, so we went and saw "Phone Booth" a truly excellent film that works well as a morality play. There is little movement, the entire thing was shot in ten days on a particular sidewalk in NYC, and the impact of the movie on my senses was astounding. I like movies that are mostly dialogue, but this one stands apart as being nearly an action film using solely dialogue. See it, especially if you're questioning your priorities; it makes everything wonderfully and scarily simple.  As predicted, I am level again. Is your brain you? Or even a part of you? If so, why does a part of me, or me myself want to fuck everything else about me up? It's a pretty specific and insidious malfunction. I read somewhere once that if one's stomach had its way, it would eat itself with its own acids. Is that how a person's brain is, too? That, if it had its way, if it was missing something simliar to the stomach's protective lining, it would simply consume itself? Brain ulcers?  Pizza Poppa let Kurt know that he knew that I was being set up by Lunkhead. That's nice. I still want to break Lunkhead's kneecaps, though.  Tomorrow, a phone payment must be made, or we get cut off. Glad it finally occured to me to actually read the bills that come in, rather than just see them on the table, and not really register that I have to pay for services such as communication. Not much sweat, really, what's going to be sweaty is the confrontation with Marcus on Tuesday. I'm sure he is not going to be fond of my attitude this time, either. I wonder if I'll freak out at him, or cry whilst on the phone with him. That would suck. My answer to thing like this is violence; I'd rather go into Marcus' office with a bat, and begin swinging, rather than confront him, and say "Um, you know that whole loan money thing that you had to put back because it was my husband's student loan? Well, you withdrew it again, and caused us to default on yet another payment. Can you put it back for real this time? Oh, and that means that you probably shouldn't remove it again. Yeah. Thanks." And as soon as the money comes back, you know, if it comes back, the damn account has to be closed before he puts us into overdraft or something the next time. God loves you Marcus, and I'm trying. Well, no, I'm trying not to have homicidal fantasies about you, me, and a chainsaw. (Ya gotta start somewhere, right?) Picture it: I run into his office, take off my trenchcoat, start the chain saw, and say to him in my best Ash voice: "Yo, she-bitch. Let's go."  Wow. What is with me and the violence lately? My dreams are "R" rated, I keep on thinking of how the Fight Club method of castration would be an effective means of dealing with Lunkhead, and I'm not even sure I want to lay eyes on Herr Landlord. Even thinking about him leads me to thinking about backing up over him with the fruity car repeatedly. Must be a springtime hormonal thing. At least, that's what I'll testify to in court.  I miss my parental units. I get to play my mom's agent and look in on some houses for her. I just hope I can stay awake long enough in the daytime hours to do it.

      Rantings of a Depressive  I would say that I've woken up on the wrong side of the bed, but this would imply that i had, in fact, slept. I missed a prozac, possibly two, and I feel undermined; everything is wrong, and of course, keeping up with the fucked up narcisscism that is my brain, that everything just happens to be me. When Kurt got home this morning from work, he left me know that Pizza Poppa was pissed off at me, because he told me to stay until three am. I did not, because the Lunkhead told me that I was to go home at twelve, because, never fear; Lunkhead was there. Pizza Mama had warned me a few shifts ago not to listen to ANYONE there regarding instructions of any kind, unless I had got confirmation from herself or Poppa. She had further told me that people, in particular, Lunkhead, was cuthroat when it came to hours, and would try to get as many from me as he possibly could. I forgot these salient points, and Lunkhead not only got me into a moderate to mild bit of trouble, he sharked hours that were mine. The latter is not so important, the former very much is. As long as the bills get paid eventually, and I do not develop a nervous breakdown, good. Having one of your bosses reckon you flaked out on him is Not Cool. I am planning on phoning tomorrow to explain what happened, and further plan to confront Lunkhead on that front, as well as the whole talking-to-me-like-i'm-a-complete-git thing. But fuck. I listened and Obeyed LUNKHEAD. Very dumb.  And, i know i mentioned it earlier, but do i ever feel like slime when i think of that old lady being afraid of Lucas. Wow. The term "sorry" I hardly ever use, because, literally, it means wretched and foul. For the most part, when I appologize, I do not feel like that, so I tend to say 'i appologize' rather than 'sorry'.  In this instance, I am extremely sorry.    i'm sick. My ear hurts, my back and chest hurt from coughing, I have a headache, my throat is sore, and I've just popped three extra strength advil to take the edge off. I don't want to touch the mold with a ten foot pole with a condom on it, but yet, it's gotta go, even if it does reappear in a week. My moronic landlord called all in a tizzy two nights ago for us to have certain items waiting for him on our step because he would be there in ten minutes to pick them up; it's still patiently waiting.   I feel right now like I am incapable of doing anything right. Bills loom, sickness lingers, I should have vaccumed my floor a week ago, and I'm on the little-to-no-sleep sleep schedule.   i've got a funky feelings like there's holes in my personality all over the place, that I lack in moral fiber, I'm iresponsible, that I'm a big meddler in other people's lives, I'm dumber than the lint in a dryer, am unlikeable, am worthless. These thoughts have nothing to set them off, and that somehow makes it worse; I'm just a freak who needs attention, is a mental hypochondriac, and have no rational, good, or solid reason to feel the way I do. There is no cause for this mental pain; I'm just being silly, oversensitive, whatever.  And I'll sleep in a bit, take my pill for the day, and be most evened out tomorrow. It just doesn't seem to make any sense at all that these feelings of self-pity and depression, as deep and all-consuming as they are, as they feel right now, can be exorcised with regular doses of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Neither does it make any sense that a pill I've relied on to even me out every day has pooped for no reason at all,. Paxil, Effexor, Zoloft, Celexa - each one lasted a certain amount of time, and i woke up one day, and it didn't work any more. On to the next: repeat. Celexa was the last, and lasted the longest; two years. I'm always in the state of waiting for the other shoe to drop. How can you escape feelings of dread and futility when the very thing you're relying on invariably becomes dreadful and futile?

      We did not close trhe bank account in time; Marcus put his foot up our asses again by taking the same money he took out before (Kurt's loan) and making us default on our car/insurance payment. On the other hand, if Herr Landlord hadn't 'inadvertantly cashed' out rent check early, well, we wouldn't be in this spot. I've been having violent dreams, where Herr Landlord's head explodes because my hands are squeezing his neck too hard. I assume I'm not dreaming about Marcus because I can't put a face to the voice.  We have opened up our window to let the cats out to play; Lucas has been using it as an escape route while we're out. We narrowly missed having a 200 fine, Lucas became a Dog Running At Large. A man with an 80-year old mama complained, because he is worried that Lucas will knock over his mom. I definitely can't blame him, and I feel like a rat's ass about it. Do you think the guy would apperciate a "I'm immensely sorry" card? I really want to get in touch with him and appoligize, but I'm chicken that he'll freak on me.   I was reading the town bi-law on the Dog subject, and this made my blood run cold - Let us say Lucas ran out of the house, just once. During this incident, he ran past that old bird, and knocked her over. I'm not even talking about a 'hi-how-ya-doing-belly-and-bag-tag', I'm talking an inadvertant run-by knockover. According to this bi-law, Lucas would then be considered a 'dangerous animal' and would, no exceptions, be killed. (They say 'destroyed', like he's an old chair or something). I am getting the FUCK out of vegas. I'm now caught with the fear that if Lucas does pull a naughty escape that he'd end up old chaired. I've been anal, he doesn't leave my sight ever once the escape had been discovered, and the animal control person got in touch with me. But still, the worst case scenario  should he escape, and do something as silly as run by someone old too fast, Lucas, my reason for living for six years would be killed. I'm deadly serious here; I don't know what I would be capable of if that were to happen. The bottom line is, though, I'm not going to let it happen.   I love work, I hate onions. Also learning to dislike intensely the smell of grease, although eating it is still hunky dory. And, give me donair meat morning, afternoon and night to eat, and I will be a happy, albeit bloated, camper. Working there has got to be a vegan's worst nightmare.

      burninating eyes sleeping in til three o'clock You would think I party...   Yep, it's noonish, and I feel like it's about six hours earlier. I'm so crawling back into bed. It's funny, i think the only reason why i'm a little annoyed with the back-to-the-night sleep schedule is that I promised myself I would get a tan this summer. The plan is to wake up around now, and relocate my sleepyness to the deck, and sleep some more in the sun once the weather becomes more agreeable. Don't bother telling me about skin cancer and all that premature aging and all, I need the sun, I need not too look like an albino with contacts and a wig, and my brain keeps telling me I look fatter when I'm pale. Stupid brain. Way more trouble than it's worth.  Herr Lanlord dropped off the stuff to clean the mold, Trisodium Phospate. It looks scary, and particularily toxic. I have a deep seated paranoia that the guy would happily posion the animals if he thought he could get away with it. Did I mention he asked the girls downstairs to be in a porn with him, and that he's been trying to get pictures of them? (This is what they tell us, anyways...i believe them, but will concede they may be lying freaks.)I think I'm going to do some more mold removal research before I put any of that shit on my walls. I have the feeling that just taking off the black stuff won't actually solve the problem, just band aid it, but we'll see, i guess.  For your moldly reading needs:  http://popularmechanics.com/home_improvement/home_improvement/2003/1/mold_removal/index2.phtml  http://www.affordablecomfort.org/html/mold-TB.html  I'm gonna go puke somewhere.

      That friggin landlord suggested what I bloody well knew he'd suggest; the ANIMALS are the cause of the mold. Moron. I'm mightily cheesed about it, I guess I take the critters and any criticism against the critters as a big slander to myself and Kurt. Besides, how do animals cause mold? Moisture causes mold, and the landlady let slip just before I talked to him that they had massive dampness problems, and that they already had to yank out a few walls previously to get rid of other mold. I looooove how all of the sudden it's the animals causing it, not just shoddy carpentry and dampness. If i ever go nuts and feel the need to sacrifice a dingleberry to the chicken gods, Herr Landlord and Frauline Landlady are going down faster than the Hindenburg. And then, I'd find Marcus.  There is precious little new to report; Kurt and I are trying to figure out how to keep our wedding bands. Doesn't sound complicated in theory, but we were very partial to the platinum wedding bands, with minimum payments of 160 a month. Genius. We now appear to be several months behind said minimum payments. Eh. Seemed like a good idea at the time, and I have some fairly good ideas about how to make the reprocession of the rings an oppurtunity to do really cool things. Besides, they've got to come across Canada to get them. Heh heh heh...bastards.

      aaah, bleh.  I keep on feeling that moving out of yon moldy apartment would be an excellent, healthy, good idea. However, moving actually involves actually, physically, moving, and that simply smacks of effort. There's also the fact that moving involves a bit of insecurity, too, what with worrying about where to go, how it realtes, what hidden problems lie in wait; in this case, I guess Kurt and I are sticking with the devil we know. I'm going to talk to the landlords about mold removal; i'm fairly sure that's within our right.  Work is pretty great, i enjoy my time there, and the friends I'm making are great. Got the whole useless vibe going on, though, and that sucks. I keep on thinking I'm too slow, i screw up orders, I don't do as much as I should, etc. Dumb, dumb dumber...  As for everything else, I'm not exactly in contact with the outside world. Well, there is a reality tv show that I really want to catch; Mr. Personality. One woman plays the bacheloerette, judges guys on everything, except their faces; they wear complete masks, you can't even see the color of their hair. And, it's hosted by Monica Lewinsky.

      Yeah, so, Morrowind, work, and sleep comprise my life, hence no updates for a while. i'm going to attempt to rectify this situation, and will write more when I'm off.   Work is great, although my feet and back still hurt. I'm such a wuss.  downstairs neighbours are very dramatic, screaming and throwing things on occasion.  I've now been sick for over a month. It's the MOLD!!!

      I think I've run out of things to complain about.  Gotcha.   More accurately, I think I'm at a loss as to what to write about lately. I mean, there's the standard " I did this and that today, took a long hard crap at around three twenty, then had a nap," sort of thing, or there's the "my soul is troubled and i feel that i'm not fully actualized as an individual," or, there's the third option of the Apathetic Online Journal Generator that can be found here:   http://brunching.com/journalgenerator.html  In the news, today, at the Pizza Palace, we ran out of cheese. I ate poutine, and pizza mama and i had another long, involved conversation that seems to emcompass all our shifts together. We're at the book exchanging stage in our relationship; I lent her "Bitch", and she lent me a number of her criminology books, so I can hold off on getting that library card for a little longer. I cannot express my gratitude enough about the whole workplace deal. I don't feel incompetant there, I feel needed and valued, and I can take satisfaction in working my ass off, and feeding the pizza deprived. Also, the pressure is minimal; I'm in a workplace that values its employees. My feet hurt a lot, and my back is no prize either, but I feel satisfied in what I'm doing. I worry that I will not be satisfied long, but that's still a distant greyish cloud.  I dreamt two nights ago that a white horse smiled at me, and we ran away together. A woman on a chesnut horse pursued us, and in a rage, the woman picked up her horse and slammed it into the dirt for not being fast enough to catch us. My horse and I saved the chesnut though; the white had healing powers. The three of us lived in a field near to the ocean; they ate grass, and I fished. I seem to recall something else about a really strange cult that had taken up residence in our field, but the details are somewhat blurry.  STILL haven't gotten around to cancelling the Royal Bank account. We will, I'm sure, but it doesn't seem that I'm all that conscious during Regular Banking Hours. I feel a little messed on the work schedule; I work from 4pm till whenever they let me go, and I frequently sleep in until about an hour or so before I go to work. I sort of want to be able to go to bed right from work, but not really. I want to hang out with kurt, read, and do other stuff before sleeping.   Speaking of sleep, it is 3am. Good night, Good morning, Good afternoon.

      didn't get the job. I'm okay with that, though; they told me that they really enjoyed my interview, but they went with someone with more experience. On friday, it was the nuttiest night so far at the pizza palace. We got bogged down, had only one driver (Kurt), and the orders got up to two hours late. Pizza Mama's head damn near exploded from stress, and, eventually, she gave up the stress in favor of  rye and ginger. The rest of the night went smoothly. After our shift was done, kurt and i stuck around for another hour, drinking and talking. On Saturday, I pulled the Retard Card on Granger; I bailed on before-made boozing plans. I went to bed at 11pm.  And such is my life, it seems. When I work, it's work and sleep, when I'm not, it's sleep and hmm, well, more sleep. And, for the last little bit, I've been haunted by my classmates from elementary. It happens periodically; I'll get all pensive, and start thinking about them; reliving the olde memories. To sum up in a word; yick. I didn't have fun in school. I was picked on, and segregated, and very quickly moved on to making myself more segregated, and that didn't help a smooth transition into my teenage years. developed a nasty chip on my shoulder, and have been trying to flick it off since my third year university.  I'm in a funk. Not good funk, like George Clinton, but nasty funk. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Kurt and I are employed, we are pretty much done the first year of Kurt's education, and although we aren't exactly on our feet yet, we are pulling ourselves into a standing position.   Ehh. bedtime.

      So, either the interview went really well, or I blew it. It gets dicey, I think, when you, as the applicant, uses a phrase like "farts in the bathtub." I guess what it comes down to is that I'm pretty sure the interviewers liked me, figured i was a quick learner and such, but I don't have any experience, and they know that. They want someone for monday, so I suppose it's a matter of waiting around to see if i get a phone call. Either way, I think I'm cool, I like the pizza place, and if i get this other job, i'll be doing something I was pretty pumped for.   More nightmares last night of the vaguer sort, when i 'remember' them, all i can think of is the fear. On the upside, i was only awake in the wee hours for about 2 and a half, so that's a definite improvement over sleeping two hours, awake for three, repeat.  Oh, yeah, no ex-girlfriends of indeterminate mental states yesterday.

      It's not my fault there was no post yesterday, some sort of weird technical difficulty.  Anyways, The Chad informed me that the interview later today (assistant helper thingee for youth-at-risk) might be starring his fricken psycho ex-girlfriend. Agh. She dated him the first year Chad and I were hanging, and I disliked her even before I found out she was a co-dependant freakshow. We tried to be friends, sort of, but that didn't work because she was obsessing that I was trying to steal Chad away, and my major issue was that she was doing things like reading his emails. Yick. They broke up twice, and a month or so after the second time, she threw a TV at Chad's head. And, she's a social worker. And I might get to see her today, or work with her in the future. I just hope she's not carrying any major home appliances.  Hmm. I wonder if anyone characteriszes me as a psycho ex-girlfriend? I mean, you hear about that species of deranged feminity all the time, makes a person wonder if ALL of these girls are actual, bona fide headcases. I'm not entirely sure I'd be classified as one, since, for the most part, I was painfully indifferent to the people I dated. Perhaps I'd qualify as "Ice Queen". Or, Hose Beast.   Kurt went to the doctor yesterday, because his pinkeye turned into ear ringing, and he looked like a semi-animated corpse, the doctor informed him that he has monster inflamed things because of post-nasal drip. Are there any three words more revolting, and given to nasty mucus mental images? I'm not helping much; when we cuddle, I have this image of mucus dripping on me. Post Nasal Dripping on me. I made the mistake of telling him that, and now he revels in making horking noises where ever he goes. Incidentally, his doctor's father was a doctor I saw on a regular basis on campus. He was a man with extremely bushy eyebrows, and his treatment for everything from plantar's warts to inner ear infections was to have a really hot shower, and hork, until you can't hork any more. Charming man.  I had vicious nightmares last night, both graphic and disturbing. In one, I was in a knife fight with Boy Named Sue, and in the other I had a miscarriage. I'm not going into details, because, well, I'm thinking about them enough as it is. You know how you aren't supposed to feel pain in a dream? I think as a consequence of those dreams, I'm in one of those pensive moods. My dreams own me, if they're bad, i can't shake them for days. At the same time, though, the goodish ones, the oddish ones and the dreams classifed as 'other' always makes for good story fodder. The bad ones typically inspire those "what does it mean" thoughts, and those thoughts quickly swell into "No, really, what does it mean? What does any of it mean?" thoughts that cause me to furrow my brow, dress all in black, pretend to be Albert Camus, and listen to excessive amounts of peculiar music. Although, to be fair, that was my entire 4th year of university, and I wasn't dreaming at all then.  Granger asked the other day how people get through the world. Ask a hundred people, get a hundred or so different answers. I was thinking though, that it isn't a question of getting through things; i mean, it takes way more effort to get the world to stop. Life sort of drags you on through no matter if you're ready, if you feel like it, or if you're sick and tired. And the world is full of fuckheads. But there are lovers in that mess of fuckheads, family, friends. Pets. People saying "Thank you" and meaning it. I guess my opinon is that at any given moment, there is a fuckhead somewhere. But, in the next moment, that fuckhead could be giving his kid a much-needed hug, or feeding the homeless, or doing something worthwhile. In the end, what makes your life a living hell, or hella living is hope, and love, and remembering that we're all fuckheads.

      Well, I called my dear fiend Marcus, and asked him if it was legal to pay one student loan (mine) with another (Kurt's). Imagine my non surprise when he stated it wasn't. I then told him that is precisely what he did. He said that he saw the money was in my account, so he pulled it out. I asked him if he thought that we had started selling drugs, or had won a modest lottery, as, all of a sudden there was about 3000 bucks in our account. He informed me that because I didn't return his phone calls (He called me once) and that I was owing money, he had every right to do what he did. I asked him if he thought withdrawing close to a grand in three weeks was standard policy, he re-iterated that I hadn't returned his phone call(s). I told him I didn't phone back, because nothing had changed in the eight hours from when he phoned me; that is to say that I didn't suddenly come up with what i was owing, I did not get a job (as of that point) and my forms to get everything all neat and consolidated hadn't materialised from Out West. He said I had a responsibility to phone the company I was owing money to, I said that I was going to when I actually had something to say. He mentioned my credit rating, and how it was going to suck, and something about seven years bad luck or something, and I said. "Look at my file. My credit already sucks, because of a mistake Royal Bank made A YEAR AGO, that still hasn't been resolved, and, if I'm not mistaken, where all of this current issue is coming from. All I want is to get this paid before I die, and I couldn't give a rat's ass about my credit rating." He again said something about my errant irresponsibilty in most unflattering terms. I said for the third time that it was ecessive to withdraw that much money from an account, in that length of time, in particular without sending off in writing, or a phone call, his intentions. He told me he didn't like my attitude, and that I had better get off the phone with him right away before he decided not to put (less than half) the money back.   He is going to be surprised when that account gets closed. After the rent is paid, I am never, ever, EVER going to be a customer of Royal Bank again. I have the feeling that if i did leave it open after the rent goes, Marcus would find a way to put me in overdraft, and I'd be fucked up the ass again next month. So, I figure I have nothing to lose, I might as well make things as difficult for Marcus as I possibly can. Goodness knows, he's doing the same for me. And that's what good customer service is all about, isn't it? Consideration, and doing all that's possible for your client.   Reading back on what I just wrote, I feel empowered that I stood up for myself. This guy has been an intimidating, evil asshole for months, I am inordinately glad I was able to hold my ground. However, I should mention what happened afterwards. I burst into tears, and stayed in tears for an hour. I'm not entirely sure I can explain why. Perhaps because I know that despite my little outburst, I'm in the same boat as before. Same time, next month. Also, I hate hating people, and I loathe Marcus, and I made sure he knew I loathed him. He had somehow turned me into an asshole, and I'm not even getting paid for it.   To rant: the fucking economy is a consensual hallucination, it means absolutely nothing. It doesn't help you when your personal economy is good, it just takes the "No Exit" signs off. And when it's bad, you get paid assholes like Marcus phoning you at eight in the morning on a Saturday, making sure you know that other people think you're a deadbeat, and otherwise a person of ill repute and many character flaws. Emotional fuckwittage.   During the Great Depression, there wasn't a lack of food, and people starved anyways. There were still people around to do the work, wheat rotted in the fields. It was although someone had walked into a kitchen, and placed an order for a pizza. The baker refuses, because he has no ounces. He has everything he needs, and he's capable of doing the task, but there is no precise method of measuring things, so it all goes to hell. Ridiculous, if you stop and think about it. The great depression was a hallucination that turned into a bad trip. I never really understood why people didn't at least try to put in a new system, you know, switch to metric. I guess, to connect the two bits of rant here, how far are you, (me, the guy down the street,) going to let these invisible people with numbers based on theoretics take you? I turned into a pile of mushy goo when I was told by a voice on the phone that I was, in effect, a bad person. That's an awful lot of power I let him have over me, and on the larger scale, it's scary how much power all these things have over us all.   I think it's things like these that gets Kurt's underwear all bunchy.   It's also interesting to note that Pizza Mama has had phone calls of a semi-harassing nature from Royal Bank. The disturbing coincidence is, he paid asshole's name is Marcus.   Worked for a few hours last night, with Lunkhead. I'm happy to say that he's not nearly as dumb as he puts off, like I mentioned before, it must be that peculiar 18-year-old thing. He's extremely fun to work with as well. I think, if i hadn't been overly concerned about the outward (As in what he was showing off as opposed to what he was really like), I would have realised that most people who are fun to work with are usually smart. I suppose that makes me the lunkhead.

      I sped right through yet another book. It's like I have brain worms or something, i keep reading, but the old brain just isn't satisfied. Hollow brain? No jokes, please, it's just too easy.  It's raining out. Sounds like pee. Luckily, it washed away the characteristic bovine poop smell that permeates this region, but it also means that the prospect of slipping and falling on one's face is high, due to the massive amounts of mud. Not that I've done it; well, not yet. With all the mud here I could possibly slide - penguin style all the way to work. I could figure out a way to market it as the only way to travel, cheaper and less annoying that transit. Just as smelly though.  Another day off passes, but today, five loads of laundry were done, the rest of the time spent holed up in my nice warm, unmuddy bed, newly comfortable thanks to a muli-textured foamy thing that minimizes the searing pain that cheap mattresses afford. Who came up with the brillant idea that we humans ought to spend our sweet respose sleeping on coiled metal springs?   Herr landlord was lurking today, in the dark of the laundry room. He was busted and had to turn on the lights when his cell phone rang. I happened to be looking out the window at the time, makes me wonder how long he was looking at me looking out the window. Didn't know he was there until the telltale ring.   Im working on getting all my stats up to one hundred before the big showdown with dagoth ur in morrowind. I'm not that geeky; kurt has been reading the DM's guide almost obsessively for days. Vote now: Who is geekier? Me, or Kurt?  Pleeeeeeeeeease, write me! Give me imput, appproval, a sign of life.. a kick in the bum, anything...  "It must be a Thursday. I never did get the hang of Thursdays."                                                            -Arthur Dent

      My jaw hurts, and now, oddly enough, my ear.   See now, I had my wisdom teeth removed when they were still impacted, which meant surgery, stitches, and a lot of post op drugs. There was a lot of pain-in-the-assness involved afer, though, when I hyper healed, produced a lot of scar tissue on the insides of my mouth, and began biting them a lot, causing infection, and a lot of annoying pain. Seems that I must have been biting the inside of my face a lot, becuase it hurts like hell, and now my ear hurts.  That's what I get for having my wisdom teeth removed in a mall. But I still have the teeth, in a little home-ec made medicine pouch, which hangs around the neck of my favorite stuffed animal of all time, Blind Bear.  I don't want to be on medication anymore. That is to say, I don't want to be on prozac anymore, or any other supposed medication that is designed to 'help' with the mood disorder that occasionally seems to encompass my entire life. The side effects are lousy; I'm jumpy, paranoid, and sometimes the prozac winds me up like several cups of coffee followed by a couple of jolt colas. This is not the worst of it. On paxil, I was hallucinating, on Celexa, my short term memory was all but anilhilated, Zoloft also screwed with my memory. Effexor did nothing side effects wise, but it did nothing for symptoms either. (It was a fuck you to effexor when i took them all at once during the summer of hell, i reckoned that if one a day didn't work, perhaps fifty might.)  Zips me up, makes for interesting problems in the mental process, creates the effect of trying to communicate through warm oatmeal; that's what these drugs have done, not to mention the stunning and horrid process of becoming unaddicted to an anti-psychotic that was wrong prescribed and inadquately doled out. All of this, and many more depressingly physcial side effects to boot, in exchange for having my moods somewhat, sort of regulated. Reminds me of Olean. This was a company that produced potato chips. Someone had the brillant idea of using a fat enzyme that couldn't be absorbed by the human body, thus rendering their potato chips fat free. There's always a tradeoff, though. Each package of chips had the ominous phrase written in red after the ingredigents: May cause anal leakage. No fat, but you're going to leak out of your butt, because, after all, the human body can't absorb the fat we put in there, so yeah, here are some Depends.  I sort of feel that I'm exposing myself to terrible consequences of being on a litany of new and exciting drugs. I'm waiting to find out what the long term effects are, and what effect being on this pharmacutical rainbow will be on my body. I know my short term memory still has pretty substantial holes in it. I'm waiting for my fingers to turn green and rot off, or something. I was even told by my optomitrist that the fact that I need glasses is something most likely caused by anti depressants.   It's depressing. Which, considering, is not particularily benifical. I know that if i went to the doctor, and told them my deal, they'd up my doseage, or prescribe something else. I'm not sure if i can go through another 4-6 weeks of adjustment to a new drug, waiting out the side effects that happen initally, trying to deal with the side effects that come in as a permanent addition to the little pill's original intent, and then, after about two months, trying to determine if the drug is actually doing its job in stablizing my sadness. There would certainly be time lost at work, time spent throwing up, pissing out of my bum, and various other slightly infirming symptoms, and weeks of them.  So, not an option. Upping the doseage to get the crying under control may be an option, but I'm sort of inclined not to. My interest in taking the damn things is definitely decreased. last week and a bit I have been experimenting with not taking them at all. Not an option, either. In fact, the non compliance with my precription may have just caused my lack of interest in taking them, if you follow the convolutions.   Work, and home, however, have been good. I do spend one of my days off almost exclusively in bed. Works, I feel pretty ready to go after this rest period, but it seems excessive. Silly thing to worry about, but that's me in a nutshell, worrying about every little thing until it finally slams into my skull that worrying is about as effective, and as useful as teaching a fish to whistle.  Supposed to write a story for Kurt. Anyone have any topic suggestions?

      Ate "The Lovely Bones" in a few hours. Despite being disturbing, and sad, this book is incredibly optimistic. A sweet book. Chick Flicky. And, I think, very Important to read if you're a body who's a little sad. Next on the menu is "Prozac Nation", a book that has been calling my name since I'm a part of the global prozac nation.  and, well, blah. Nothing to write here, move along.

      I can't imagine living in a place that does not have deep differences in seasons; I'd miss the inordinate amount of satisfaction that happens when the leaves burst out of their buds. For me, the change in seasons always remind me of  that saying 'a watched pot never boils'. In the depths of the snow, the dirty snow on the sidewalk, the horrible slippy cold mud that happens when it rains just enough to make the winter entirely unpleasant, there doesn't seem to be an end to the minus temperatures, the pain in the ass of wiping and scraping the snow and frost off the car, and the cold that seeps throughout my body, there is a pressing Need for spring, for summer, for slightly sweaty temperatures.   I wait and wait, while blizzards happen, my toes go dead from being cold, while the snow seems to pile up, sometimes looking very asthetically pleasing, but never pleasant enough. This need for lots of sun, green things, even blackfly and mosquito bites lasts for weeks. Then, I hunker down, and settle in, and dimly watch the dirty slush get redistrubuted by cars. When it first gets warm out, I don't dare hope that the season may actually be changing, I wait for another dump of snow. One day, I'll see that the grass is green. Then, it seems, within days, flowers are out, the birds start their tunes around 5.30 am, and it's been almost a month since I moaned about how cold I was. In short, every year, no matter the longing, and the wait, spring blindside tackles me, then runs off into summer so quickly, I get dizzy.  And every year, this tackle, this change makes me inordinately happy, right up until i get my first barrage of mosquito bites. Then, I think of how mercifully dead those little bastards are in the depths of winter.  And here's something I thought of after dreaming of the Architect: The A says 'please' when Our hero suggests the Mother is the Oracle, in such a way as to demonstrate contempt as in: "shaddup you silly meat popsicle that's too obvious", or "please,.don't call her the Oracle, that's a gay name", or please, as in "Neo, stop interuppting". Could the Mom be Persephone? There are speculations to this effect on Fark.com, if you're so inclined.  The lovely bones is a good book, semi-disturbing, which i happen to like in a book. i find that books that keep me slightly disturbed, on the edge, make for excellent thought processes, although I could just be thinking that i'm having interesting thought processes, when, in fact, I'm actually hooked up like a coppertop in a vat of goo with a lot of plugs everywhere.   Ok, sleep time.

      It is the end of an Era, plus a few days.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is over, and  I'm immensely sad about it. It was the most consistentaly well written show I had ever seen, it had heroes that were wonderful, flawed, and just like you or me, or Joe Public down the road. It was the only show that I was emotionally invested in, and thinking about it makes me all sad and wistful. I get like this when I finish a good book, I cry every time I finish the chronicles of narnia, or the world according to garp.  Ahh, Buffy. She's my hero.   Lunkhead is now possibly resting easily, the girl he supposedly knocked up is not so knocked up after all. To be honest, I've enjoyed his subduedness; it was less shrill in the store. But all good things must come to an end, so i suspect he'll be all mouthy and idiotic come the weekend.  Watched the matrix reloaded. They fairly pounded the idea of choice into the viewer's skull, not to mention purpose. I'l have to watch it again in order to make sense of what i saw, and more times beyond that to make any sort of in depth analysis. The movie was amazing, the stunts fraught with intensity, and I thought it an excellent compliment to the first. I also really appericated that the movie did not address the problem of agent smith; he gets to be the main focus of the next, due to be released in November. Do yourself a favor, kids - see this one on the big screen.  Prosaic is life, When you're a pizza vampire I'll never get a tan...  I love my job. Well, you know, not the burning, or the weird bastard customers who ask me out for coffee when i'm taking their orders because, evidently, i have a sexy voice, but the Muppet, Mama, and the lovely Delicious are wonderful friends who happen to be co-workers. And I know it sounds all co-dependant and clingy, but working with Kurt has been nothing else but awesome. For the first time since High School, I feel like i have a home. And by that, I do not mean I'll be sleeping under the pizza oven, i just feel all nice and tailored in. Now, if i could eliminate all debt, kill a few people and make it look like unfortunate accidents, start writing like i zarking mean it, and get a tan, I'll be set. My needs are simple.

      Everyone has issues.  I know on the outset that might seem to be a fairly obvious statement, but I know I don't think about it often. There's even a lame pop song to this effect, so, you know, it's on the minds of Amanda Marshall fans. People you, me and the buddy down the road have serious issues. Lunkhead, who is a high school dropout, and is under the age of majority almost peed in his pants today; he might be a dad. I got a confession from an aquaintence that she had an unwanted pregnancy while still in her teens, and had a subsequent miscarriage that still gives her nightmares. My boss' mom ran away with another woman. Almost every woman I've ever met have been sexually assaulted, or attacked.  I've always maintained that everyone has at least ten good stories, but I think it may be fair to say that everyone has at least one issue, and most have myriads. I guess it's more screamingly obvious evidence to the effect that we're deeply disturbed as a race. I'm not even going to get into the tragedies we all face.To paraphrase Chuck; over time everyone's survival rate drops to zero.  Had a dream where it was winter, i was home in hickville, and I was hitchhiking home, although there weren't any cars on the road. It was sunny, and winter, like the slushy march breaks I had as a kid, where i spent the whole time skiing, and had the winterface tan. Anyways, i round a turn, and there's a person in front of me, a good ways away, wearing a long, long jacket that's red, on the inside, when the wind blows it aside, i can see yellow. The hood is up, but i get the impression the other walker is female. I'm just noticing that i should be freezing my ass off (I'm only wearing jeans and a pink blouse) when the other walker stands on a guardrail. I start running towards her/him, because good god damn, we're on a cliff, and falling would be a sudden greasy stop, but I don't get to her in time. She's still falling down toward the rocks when i get there. I look at my feet, and see a card; like a baseball card, only theres something gold attached to it. On the card is something I can't read, and a classic picture of the Virgin Mary. I pick it up, and lean over the rail, trying to spot the jumper, if i can climb down, etc. All that's below me are clouds, and i wake up with one of those full body spazzes.

      Kurt bought me a book, a sci fi book he'll probably read next. It's refreshing to read a story, rather than dream analysis, sex techniques, or the canadian penal system; I don't understand those folks who only read non-fiction, straight, unmigitigated information is a nice, good thing, but it lacks something. I don't know, what, really, but, it rather feels sterile compared to the lovely messiness of fiction.  Living the life of the undead is a definitely benificial if you're a low grade agoraphobe, not so good if you ever want to do quasi-normal things like visit the post office and speak to a human. I'm not saying I want to, but it might be nice to have that as an option. Maybe. Does anyone know the detriments to sleeping all day, and up during the night? Is it bad for your body, or is it just a matter of getting the apporpriate number of Zzzs no matter the time of day or night? My sister says something along the lines of that ones has a tendancy to eat pretty piggy when you stay up late, but i hadn't noticed any major weight gains.  Speaking of dear province hopping Pol, she's going back to The City, dragging Boyfriend Number Two. Okay, that's not fair, he wants to go; but it is humorous that Pikey will be the second boy of Pol's to live in Chez Mommie and Daddie. Should be interesting, anyways. They're hopefully going to come down here and spend some time, and get to know the Pizza People.  Matrix on sunday....

      I was surprised, not to mention knocked out of a coma when Granger knocked on my door Sunday..thanks for coming by and waking our asses up, we needed some out time. Chinese food was had by all, it was lovely.  My wounds are healing, I'm not remembering my dreams as of late, and I'm near salivating with anticipation to see Matrix. This is the extent of excitement in my life, I have to live vicariously through my sister who is dragging Pikey back to Cowtown. Pikey would be boyfriend number Two that Pol's clubbed over the head and drug back to my parents house.  This one is leaps and bounds more agreeable to the wank spanking freak that took up perfectly usable space last winter. (To be fair, I liked the wank spanker, but there's a line, ya know?)  To my dear friend Chad, whom I have not spoken to since the Paleolithic Age: I am going to call you in the next few days, you had better be home and in a talkative mood and have many amusing stories for me.   My next night of pizza vampiring is Friday, which works, maybe I'll see daylight this week. Probably not, though, I keep on saying to myself "Geez, I ought to walk the dog/sunbathe/do laundry" Instead, I roll over and go to sleep, or play morrowind until i get dizzy.  Speaking of which, I'm off to pick pockets and make merry.

      Pizza Mama gave me  a dream dictonary to peruse the other day, and I found out, (you know, possibly,) about one of my reoccuring dreams. See, I frequently have this dream about cats. Not normal, cuddly, poop in a box in your house cats, but deformed, sick, dieased and dead cats. In the dream, I'm walking barefoot through the bottom floor of an old house, walking over these cat corpses and semi cat corpses. There's a lot of crunching noises. I have to get to the other end of the house, although when I arrive there, I will be excuted. In some versions of this dream, I am pregnant. Pretty damn weird, if you ask me. Anyways, the dream dictonary said that animals in one's dreams signify a specific personality trait in the dreamer. Deformed, diseased, etc, animals occur in dreams when the dreamer is disgusted, alarmed, or otherwise unhappy with that particular trait. Cats signify femininity. So, according to this dictonary, I'm more than a little bit bothered by the fact that I happen to be female, and have female characteristics. That's pretty dead on, I think, although I certainly haven't given it much thought. I mean, it's not like i sit down and moan, and dream of one day having a penis. Nope. It's more like I understand my limitations, and I really understand my limitations as being female. It's not so much the femalesness, rather the crap that goes with it. Being afraid in elevators when a guy or two gets in, and I'm by myself. Assholes- the ones that hit on me, and when I try and turn them down, they become hostile. Not being taken seriously, because I'm a girl, people way back in flea market days talking to Kurt, because they assumed he was the salesman. Never allowed having guy friends, because, men and women can't be friends, because all they really want to do ever is rut like the monkeys they're decended from. My best friend is a guy, and people might think it unseemly if we went and caught a movie together, particularily now, since I'm only supposed to be associating with my husband on a twosome basis. Well, fuck the world right in the ear, because that's not how the world should be. I can't change the world, I know that. But I can decide what bullshit I want to buy into, and what I'm going to ignore.   And, just because I'm here, on this rant, a very special fuck you goes out to the golfers who thought because I was a bartender somewhere touristy and expensive, that I was a whore, waiting for that all-important offer to go back to the golfer's hotel room, because he'd make it worth my while. And that fuck you can also extend to my boss when i was that bartender, who told me that I had to be ever so polite to these evil annoying  idiot pigs, on and off duty, lest the golfcourse be besmirched my me telling said pig golfers to stick their clubs elsewhere.  Work is groovy, no more injuries, but hey, I got lots of time to cut off my appendages, burn them, and spill hot oil over myself. There's a new girl at work who spells 'delivery' as 'diliverey'. She's a voice student at Acadia, and she's a muffinhead; she asked Pizza Mama about her educational background. Mama told her about her criminology degree, and the Voice Student said. "Wow. and now, you work in a pizza place." Mama corrected her and said, "No, I own my own business." I'm guessing the student is an idiot, or a bitch to come off with a burn such as that. Because of this and other stupid things, The Voice Student has not endeared herself to Mama. Or me either, as I have a degree, and I work in a pizza place, and hey, I like it. I think I would have jumped the gun and replied "And now, you're fired for shooting off your mouth so indiscriminately," but hey, Mama is a far more patient than I am.  I had a dream about a Corporate Plague. I think this is a result from spending too much time with conspiracy theorists; in the dream, I was a fly on the wall in a boardroom, and these people were discussing how to create need in their market; they decided they were going to release chemicals into the drinking water to get people to buy their stuff.  Playing video games all night Reading way too much Cosmo Garbage on my mind   Mojo goes to Emma as she's in the hospital for the first time in my life with exciting blood clots, and fabulous leg injuries. She's the focal point of the family; and a great role model on how to be a lady, and get whatever you want. She's a patient, sweet woman, who never swears, and calls the show "The Golden Girls" the "Four Old Bags Show".  Emma, give the nurses and doctors hell, and get out of the hospital.

      I am wounded.  I burnt my hand on the fricken oven the other day, blisters grew and exploded within seconds, and it looks ugly. I reacted very irrationally; I almost punched said offending oven, thank God I pulled back, I can just imagine how much THAT would have hurt. Today, I splashed my other hand with oil, then almost squished it in the window when it slammed shut. I swear that store is trying to get me.  Other than the homicidal urges the store has for me; i really love work. Pizza making is an excellent, satisfying activity, and I enjoy watching myself improve in the Art. However, I'm definitely making more mistakes, burning pizzas to carbon, and injuring myself.   Saw x-men 2...ooooohh yeah. Matrix is coming up, the interesting-looking League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hulk, aah, sweet action.  I wish i had something stunning to impart, or at least an amusing story of some kind, but I got nothin'. Nothing. Not much for the social interaction since I became a  vampire pizza cook. Even the grocery shopping happens at 1am or so.   May 6 is the aniversary of the Picts' sacking of Rome, and my parents' wedding. Coincidence?

      Much mojo goes to hiccup as she wings her way to beautiful and exotic Yellowknife, to be a substitute teacher for a month. Honey, fire that travel agent.   Things are getting greener and warmer here, I can't wait until i can bask in the sun, not to mention go swimming, and hopefully, maybe, go to the Island and spend time with Beach Family. Ahh, to be in the waves, and throw jellyfish at unassuming friends...  Finished reading "Fight Club" again. It was a hard book for me to read, since it deals with hitting bottom, trying to attain complete self-destructiveness. There were parts that made me cry, softie that i am, but it's one of those books that's worthwhile to read.  No sign of Herr Landlord. He makes me feel the same way CJ did, (CJ was the stalker who died of exposure a few months back) I feel bad for him,  his debts, and he seems like the sort of person that no one can relate to; and that's immensely sad. On the other side of things, he's a pain in the ass, creepy, and lately, scary. I have this weird hate-want-to-feel-compassion for him, but I can't, he scares me too much and has not been overtly nice in the past. I no longer have the need to squeeze his neck until his head pops off, though, and i think that's an improvement.  Creepy landlord man Watching people at midnight Time to buy a gun  Fridges, when they belong to me, are inherently, wildly frightening. I cleaned mine the other day. Never again will I let my fridge act as a compost heap, honest.

      My dreams have finally come true. I can become Ash, can kick deadite bum, with my trusty double barrelled shotgun from S-mart, and my heh heh 'handy' chainsaw. There's a lot of blood spurting in this game, and instead of feeling slightly nauseated, like I usually do, I find it tremendously satisfying. Kurt thinks it's because I feel a pressing need for evil things to suffer and die. I tend to agree. Buffy is my favorite superhero, next to superman, and Ash is my favorite anti-hero, even though if he were to talk to me, I'd probably want to kick his head in for being impertinent. Anyways, for the similarily blood thirsty, the game is called "Fistful of Boomstick" and you can get it for the PS2.  Read the new Potter in 14 hours or so. Damn fine book, but now I need another to feed my addiction. (Books that is, I enjoy the wait between Potter books, as long as it's not ridiculous.) I went to the library about two weeks ago though, and that was a big, sad, sorry zarking disappointment. It'd be great if I read romance novels, or lots and lots of childrens books. Their selection is abyssmal. I went in expecting at the least a lot of classic novels - you know those; it's 50-50 that you'll like the book or it will bore you so much you'll die. Alas. not even a copy of "Middlemarch" (That's on my list of most boring, tried reading it eight seperate times.) But, if I'm interested in heaving bosoms, and swashbucking brutal sailors who have tender sides and are capable of bring a woman to orgasm just by looking at her tenderly, weell, whoooooo eeeee, did i ever hit the jackpot. Yuck. So, now I'm reading "A Brief History of Time" again. Great book, but I want stories.  Saw the Hulk. Good solid movie, good special effects, and much more interesting than I would have thought, given it's about a big, green, angry fellow. It's a big screener; the special effects should not be wasted on my piddly 13 inch screen. I do have some criticisms of course, but it's a movie I'd happily gallavant off to see again.  And that's it.

      Staff meeting was long and pointless. There was some entertaining sword rattling, and emphasis  put on  better customer service, but it was an hour and a half I'd much prefered sleeping. We did come to a concensus in the after meeting unoffical meeting that every grieveance any worker has is either directly or indirectly caused by Lunkhead, and his cousin, Farm Boy. Aw, fuck kitchen politics, what it boils down to is that L & FB are not pulling their weight, everyone else suffers, we hate them, the end.  I really wish i had an issue, a burning insight, or something of import to place here. don't got it, though. Not the political type, not really passionate about anything much, and, as personal as I get here, I do not get personal enough - it's a rather sanitized version of what happens in my head, and in my immediate environment. So really, a person could say this blog is meaningless, entirely pointless, a utter waste of an overly-curious person's time.  Good thing I don't give it that much thought.  Minako - you're probably right. Oddly enough though, as right as you are, the other folks tell me I really ought to talk to this girl, get some closure. I've got to give it an excessive amount of thought. (not that I've not been obsessing already, but you know, everyone needs a hobby.)     Laundry on the floor Unwashed, stepped on, and ignored The pants are weeping.  I showed this haiku to jeff:   Jeffypoo says: weeping? Naked Nerd says: you know, crying? Naked Nerd says: also could mean oozing something nasty Jeffypoo says: eeewwww.. Jeffypoo says: that's cool.  Ass is expanding Pizza utterly to blame Fatness is my fate.  Well, not just pizza.. a liter of coke, donair meeeeeeeeaaaaaaat, donair sauce, garlic fingers. The list continues, but I'm salivating already. Did i mention groceries, particularily healthy groceries, are expensive?

      Went for a Sunday afternoon drive this evening, such getting lostness has not happened since the Days of Chad. Saw a sunset, saw horses in the distance, bought some quiche and ate it. Spent an hour outside, talked to my parental units - another fabulously exciting day off.   Have a staff meeting today, at the unholy hour of 8am. Yuck. We all work backshift, so I don't imagine any of us will be all that chipper. Unfortunately, it's the only time any of us aren't working, so, here we are, dazed by the spelendor of the morning. Maybe I'll be chipper...ah, who am i kidding? I'm never chipper, let alone before noon. We're learning how to make four different types of nachos, and Mama is addressing grievences she has with the staff. Ought to be a long meeting.  On the issue of Fate - been having dreams about this girl. She was the terror of my elementary years - I'm not even sure she has any idea how much my life was affected by her. In my dreams, we are the age we are now. And I'm usually at her house. We're talking, we're helping each other do things, get over things, we're close friends. I've been having dreams like that for six months. But, she's always been in my head, one of my writing excercises was about people who affect me, and I wrote a thing on her. here goes:  Most of my childhood centered around avoiding her barbs, her verbal and physical attacks. She was always much much taller than me, darker than me, and her hair was extraordinary, because, unlike the midrange muddy that almost everybody around home had, hers was a real black. Not just dark brown, when the sun hit it, it had a blue shine. I look back, and seem to think that she was beautiful, but I only watched her face for danger signs. I was in trouble if her lip curled to the right. It happened for only a flash, that curl, then the words started. I was a sasquatch, a nose picker, a weirdo, a freak, I didn�t go to church. She was physically intimidating, everyone I knew was smaller than she was, and so, more than half the class was under her control - a knot of people, trying not to be the object of her irritation. Her hair was always styled, even in grade six. She wore interesting clothes. She didn�t talk in class, except to her lessers, two cronies, if grade six girls with 80s crimped hair could be considered as such. They often did the picking if she was not feeling up to it, or was busy with something else, since I was always on the wrong side of things, picking on me was a surefire way to solidify her favor. 	The first time it got physical I tried to go around her in the stairwell. She reached for me, and I wasn�t fast enough to dodge.  She pulled me into a corner, and slapped me, with her huge hands, her painted fingernails, her rings, all fast moving towards my face, I was so scared, I froze completely, fists curled tightly under my chin, eyes shut tight. The slaps didn�t hurt, not that I remember, but many and fast they hit me, over and over again, until someone ventured into the stairwell. She was gone before I opened my hands.  Yeah. She was entirely fucking scary. I stood up to her eventually. Just before we went to the big school, to grade nine. I told her what her future would be. To my horror, it came true, to the letter. Haven't seen her since she dropped out. And then, the other day,  I was talking to a friend who lives a few hours away. This guy, Brewmaster, works with her brother. She lives a few hours from me. She's in contacting range. Do I open that can'o'worms because of my dreams, or do I think to myself "Concidence," and never, ever, ever even think about getting in touch with her? Is it entirely peculiar that I think about my dreams as much as I do? These are the questions, kids.  Great. It's six am, and I'm now offically tired. The truly rotten thing is, that frigging staff meeting happens at eight. BAH! I wentto bed at midnight, woke up at two, again at four, and stayed up at four because of some nasty dreams and excessive warmness. I don't sleep. I nap excessively.

      Crispy Minis- annoying spokesperson, lovely snack. I mean, gooooooooooood. I'm not into ricecakes, and i love these things. Speaking of rice cakes, and crap such as that, Kurt and I are going to battle our pizza blubs by beating each other up, (started that - I'm sore, got hit in the nose, and spent a lot of time flinching) swimming (it's too damn cold so far). We also notice that we eat like freaks - one meal a day, usually something from work, which means grease, carbs, and fat fat FAT. So, we're going to try some meal replacement shakes. you know, one for breakfast, one for lunch, and THEN, a nice, fatty supper. Well, we're going to try and stop that bit, but groceries are expensive, pizza tastes good, and pizza with the works with donair sauce is even better. And then, there's poutine, a myriad of other fried things, pop. You get the picture, I'm sure, and the picture is round. We reckon that eating things (or in this case, drinking said meal) might help with the blub. Or, we'll get so fat we'll explode. (Are you sure you don't want a wafer, sir? it's Waaaaafer thin!)  Mama is going through similar brain meltdowns for different reasons. She's not chemical, or, anyways, hasn't been diagnosed (diagnonsensed?) with anything. But, she runs her biz, deals with shit that way, has a baby, and a fun-filled family. And she lives above the shop - the woman gets no rest. Misery does love company, tonight we discussed various head-exploding topics, and although nothing was done, and little was said, the mutual sympathy helped.  Been dealing with inferiority issues. I think, sometimes, that no one is ever going to approve of myself and Kurt. His roomates, when we were first together pretty much had an intercession on his behalf, they were concerned for his spiritual well being. I was threatening his very Christianity. I'm still not over that. One of the roomates appologized to Kurt yesterday for his intercessions. All I could think of was "Good." Not cool, I admit. Still seething. I keep thinking those  jerks...those jerks...they never asked what I thought or believed, they didn't know me, how could they try and keep kurt away? What gave them the right to make me feel so unworthy? And, why did I let them? I know  their approval, in the long run, means less than a pair of fetid dingoes kidneys, and for the most part, I feel that. But when I'm down, I'm downer than down, and this becomes another reason why I should jump off a building. And then, I look at kurt, and he looks back, everything is back to Young Married Paradise, till the creditors call.   My parents approve, my family, some of my friends, though, emphatically, not others. Kurt's parents don't know me. I'm pretty sure, if they did, they wouldn't overly approve. I swear, I drink, I did Tarot cards as a job, played D&D, there's a lot of things they wouldn't understand. I've never been a church goer, not really. Not overly inclined to start, either. Heh. One of my first memories of church, besides my great grandmother's funeral was a sister asking me what my name was. I told her, and she got upset. mad, even. She yelled that my name was not a Christian name, and took me by my hand to find my mother. My mother looked vaguely embarassed, and told her my middle name was Marie. The sister, somewhat appeased, stalked off. Weird, huh? Perhaps that singular childhood event made me all approval crazy about Being Good. Well, no, probably not.

      Ugh. Nightmares and crying, and other associated crap has been baraging me for days (weeks, months, yeaaaaaaaaars). You know how you get a flu, and you have the flu for an inordinate amount of time, and it simply will not fuck off and die? Similar situation here. I'm sick of being sad, anxious, overwhelmingly grieved. I'm dead sick of waking up, and feeling Very Disappointed when I realise it's another day. And, boy, do I ever feel bad for the people around me, Kurt must ask me if I'm okay forty thousand times a day, he has to deal with my widely divergent insecurites day in, and day out, and my family, well, my family has been at it for years. And the worst bit is that I know, distantly, academically, that how I feel is somehow fake, it's a chemical screw up, and I'm not always going to feel like this forever, but, I can't bring that thought in close enough to be any comfort at all. Instead, I feel this need to feel anything else. This thought often pushes out other thoughts, and it's immmense.   Yeah, I know, depressing.  Everything else is fine, I'm getting On the Books at work, so as I can be all official, and draw pogey if ever i need it. (That will be in a million years, after 900 hours of work or so.) I'm happy about it, makes me feel secure, like I'm all invested in the job. Not that I'm not already emotionally invested - it's hard to explain. Anyways, the point: I feel good about it. Suggests to me I'm going to be there for a while, and I like that. On the other side of things I am terribly afraid something will happen, and i won't be able to work, or cope with work, and have to lie in a bed and stare at comfortable corners. Waiting for the other shoe to drop sucks, especially when it has dropped, with force and nastiness, a hundred times before.  Kurt and I are managing to slowly pay the bills. Slowly. The animals are healthy.   Also, Kurt's teaching me how to fight.

      Nothing new or exciting happening here. Well, I might be going bald, but we'll see. In lieu of crap about my life I usually write, here is another excerpt from my writing endeavors. It was just an excercise, no purpose required. What I had to do was write an almost-fight, you know, those discussions that come close to arguements, or those arguements that come close to fights. Enjoy.  It seems to me that we are always in the car when a "discussion" happens. I�m driving. 	�You know how horrible it is,� He�s looking at me. 	�Yes, I know that it kills you a bit slower than the disease, but I grew up around it, and it gives a person a chance.� I drive up to the intersection, give a three count at the stop sign. I think the conversation is over. It is not. 	�Well, actually, there is no causal evidence linking chemotherapy or radiation with eradication of the illness. When I worked at the funeral home, the cancer patients were always the worst; the insides of them were usually rotting.�  	�Enough.� I turn a corner, pass a car. �But it wasn�t the cancer that was doing the rotting. It was the treatment.� I stop at another intersection. 	�All right, enough. I know what the treatment does to people,� I can see him in my periphary. I know what he�s going to say. The funeral home. More grisly examples. �Shut up.� His mouth closes. �I also know what happens to people when they don�t get treatment. They die. Every single one of them. That  ten year old kid in Mexico who was on the news for refusing treatment, My grandfather. Sally�s father, a woman I grew up with. These people refused treatment, and folded under six months, some in three. I�m sorry I shut you up, you were saying?� 	He nods, I hold his hand for a moment, at the red, let go when I shift up. �I�m saying, personally, I wouldn�t do it. It doesn�t matter I guess, I�m not likely to get cancer.� �I can�t marry you.� I say, missing no beats. My brain flickers, checking for truth. It finds it, and I wonder how I could live with out him. �What?� He�s looking at me. �Think about it for a second. We�re married, you get cancer. You refuse treatment, you die. I�m sorry for thinking this, but where does that leave me, then?� 	�That isn�t fair,� he trails off, and is silent longer than a song on the radio. I ask what he is thinking, and he tells me he just reversed the situation. I now have cancer, and I refused treatment. 	�I�d want you to try,� he says simply, and touches my hand on the gearshift. 	�Exactly. We�re each other�s responsiblity now, aren�t we? And it is your duty, just like it�s mine, to say alive as long as possible.� He nods. I touch his face, by his ear, at the stop light. I think the conversation has ended. This time, I am right.

      Yay! Our rotors are not shot, we got new windshield wipers, and the Garage Guy politely focused his attention away from our lack of inspection sticker. Plus, mom is going to give us rent money, aaaaaaaannnnd it looks like we'll have enough money to pay our insurance/car payment. Lookin' good folks, looking good. Big time relief happened when Kurt came home from the garage, losing our car at this point would suck ass, as well as being somewhat long term.  All i found out so far is that the Dog's name is Angie. Played phone tag with the lady, going to call her back this evening.   Saw "Finding Nemo", and I must say that movie is pretty action-packed, but I can see a lot of kids refusing to eat fish for a while after seeing it. The hero of the story is a Daddy fish, pretty unconventional, and it has that nice edge that cartoon features have been missing for a while. I noticed disney has been getting a little more edgy with Lilo and Stitch, and it seems the sort of darkish humor there,  and the sense of life being very much less than perfect, gives the animated features way more depth, and a better moral compass for kids to go by. In short, the cartoons do not appear to be commericals anymore.  drive by body piercings...

      Here's a graphic image I must share because I know it will make Chad go "eeesh". There is this deposit of flour and snot on the inside of my nose, pulling at the little hairs, and absolutely 100% refuses to be expelled. It's hurty, vaguely gross, and it's been stuck in my right nostril for almost a week.   Anyways,  Calling the Lady about the dog today, after much deliberation, and a healthy disrespect for Herr and his freakiness, Kurt and I decided it's much better to give this dog a shot at some quality twilight years, rather than spend time in the SPCA. I'm just hoping the Dog will be into sitting, lying down, and being petted, since none of us here, human, or otherwise, are terrifically into physical activity. We go on drives, and outtings to the park, but we're all inclined to sit rather than run about. Lucas enjoys the sun, but not so much running about in it. My kind of dog - laaaaazy.  Brake appointment today. Send mojo - sort of worried they won't let the car ou of the garage without inspecting it. If it gets inspected, we will have to pay lots of money to bring it up to code, as it were. Kurt cracked the windshield explaining something. There's a bit of tail light missing. Little things, really, but, expensive little things to repair. Also, we got a call from our insurance telling us that we were initally quoted incorrectly, and we must hop to pay the difference, or be uninsured. This strikes me as being a little unfair, since it was their mistake, and all.  A few have been asking about my paranoia, its quality, whether or not I really believe I'll be aducted by aliens, in short, is it normal edgy, or crrrrrrrrrraaazzzzzy edgy? Here is the best explanation I've come up with so far: I'm pretty far from panic attacks...it's a lot like i ate a lot of expresso beans, drank a vat of coffee, watched a scary movie, and decided to spend some quality time in the woods immediately after. We're not talking people-are-out-to-get-me paranoia (although, honestly, my feelings about Herr and Farulein Landlord come close), but we are talking holy-shit-don't-sneak-up-behind-me-twitch-twitch paranoia. Which, incidently, may not be ACTUAL paranoia, just excessive jumpyness.  Had my first prank phone call at work last night, and it was a mother. It started out sort of funny, I had been playing along like I knew the person, and, i guess i sort of thought i did - like it was the friend of a staff member or some such. Got nasty about  two minutes into the call, my life was threatened, the guy said he was watching me, and him and his buddies were going to come and forcibily remove my attitude problem. Pizza Poppa came downstairs, took the phone, and the guy got funny again. Poppa thought it was funny, and I managed a wan, sick little smile, and didn't say much. All the way home, I kept thinking "It was a prank, relax," alternating with "Fuck, i want a gun to smite those asshats." Poo probably understands my feeling - my sense of security was undermined. The crappy thing is that it was undermined by a bunch of sexually frustrated, drunken assholes.   It is now 1:11pm. Time to go back to bed...ahhh, the life of a Wompire. I'd go outside, and bask, but there's no sun to bask in. And it's cold. And, there's wolves after me. Good night.

      Metal on metal is the sound of the brakes in the car. This cannot be a good thing, as Kurt pointed out. He is in fear of running the car into the ground, and he's got a point, on a busy night, 400 clicks on the car is well within credibility. So, later today, he's going to call garages and suchlike, and get the brake pads replaced, and, meanwhile, we'll have to hope real hard that the mechanics will let us drive out of the garage - the car is much overdue for an inspection, and we are not entirely sure we can front the cash to do things like fix the windshield. Bloody hell, if it isn't Life that will bum you out, it will be the frigging price of maintainence that will get you. Ever wonder why essential things like medicine or glasses cost money? Never made a terrific amount of sense to me. My mom tells me stories of the price of meds my grandfather had to take in between chemotherapy sessions, and the price of each zarking pill that was necessary to him having a chance of survivial was pure, unadulterated insanity. Then again, we do live in a place where there are directions for the correct usage of bacon bits.  Kurt mentioned tonight that he just couldn't picture spending the rest of his(our) life(lives) in North America. Uhmm. This doesn't surprise me, coming from Kurt, however, since I like Canada, haven't been anywhere else but Canada, i had no intentions of moving out of Canada. I mean, i had been toying with moving to teach English in Korea, as my brother is there, and I'm sure he'd be fun to hang with in his native country, and it'd be an efficient way of paying student loans, but never once did i consider moving out of Canada, and becoming a missionary, as Kurt suspects we're going to. Besides, I'd make one crappy missionary. And, the thought of being a missionary freaks me out, waaaay out. I'm not going to get in on all my beliefs, etc, nor am I going to get all pontificaty on Christian culture, but I will say, a lot of the time, the Christian culture seems to be heavy on the Holier-than-thou bullshit that is, strictly speaking, not about Jesus. The man hung out with the dregs of society, he upbraided his followers frequently for looking down their snoot at other people. I had a conversation with poo a while back, on the subject of maintaining a good reputation. When it comes down to it, and depression isn't a factor, i don't give a pair of stinking dingoes kidneys what other people think of me, my credibility, my hair, or me picking my nose in public. And what's more, I do not think anyone should have to. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think this pretty much renders me ineffective as a missionary. And, to really drive this nail home, and to beat that dead horse, I really do think the only person I'm accountable to is God. That's it. I am not going to try and be this Shining Paragon Of Virtue, because it's a lie, I'm going to fuck up somewhere, and blow my cover, and I think it would make anything I said about my beliefs hollow, twisted, and otherwise not good.  Right, so enough on that. I'm coming close to deleting everything I said above, because I keep thinking I'm going to bother someone. Or, more likely, that I was too blabbermouthy about personal stuff that I've been, for years, very quiet about, and that will scare somebody. Big dicotomy going there. I think I mentioned it before - one of my major struggles in life was talking about stuff. When I did start talking, a lot of people got uncomfortable. A few stopped being friends. I sort of became belligrent and bitter about that, so I became open and honest about things more. (And, I hope that my honesty is a good thing, and not something based on performance and silliness) Occasionally, my openess, in particular about stuff i've been through, scares me, and I feel the need to distance myself from others. So, I'll end up not talking to someone for months because I had expoused my motivations for doing or not doing a particular thing. I guess it's sort of like embarassment. I'm afraid I'm too intense, too MUCH, or that the friend will think I'm an attention whore. So, I'll hide. I'm working on it, ok?   Wow. Now I want to delete the last paragraph because i sound like an arse.  I've not called the lady with the fifteen year old dog yet. I want to run it by kurt again, and see if we should, i dunno, ask our landlord's permission. I don't want to do that, because, hey, the guy might say no. As they said when I was the seller of TV dishes "It is better to beg forgiveness than ask permission." But, it's the correct thing to do, call our landlord, ask permission to get a big dog when we already have three pets, and the rent's overdue. I'm SURE he'll say yes.   If I had a lot of money, I would make an animal sancturary, and take care of animals that people didn't want, or couldn't have. None would be put down, even the mean ones. The mean ones would get things to chew on, and be mean to, and they would have no one bother them, or try to hurt them. There would be places for feral cats to be feral, places where old dogs wouldn't have to even try to learn new tricks, and every animal would have enough food, company, and a warm place to sleep. I would have a vet on staff, and people coming by who wanted to help. I'd shovel the dog shit, and rub the old ones' bellies. There would be a place to bury them, and they'd have little markers that said they were loved, and taken care of, and not sunk down to the bottom of the world's utter shittiness. Dogs, cats, horses, stupid birds, any animal that had no home could have one. And no thirty day life span, no trip to the animal-baking room.  Why don't I care about people this much?

      It's 6.18am. Do you know where your laundry is?  Mine's washing. It's not going to dry there. Oh no, my laundry is too damn fine for the ineptitude of the dryers Down Below. I'm going to hang them on my deck (or Stoop as Kurt calls it. Why is it called a stoop? Deck makes more sense, dunit?)   Developing a full on nesting instinct. Our apartment is, hmm. Spartan. Then, Mama gave me milk crates, and now I have a funky shelf. And, I keep thinking about furniture, wall hangings, and Kurt and i broke down and bought some bamboo, and a venus flytrap. That's right kids, it's time to get DOMESTIC. We were going to get Cactii, as they are the easiest form of greenery to take care of, but since Phoebe lacks anything resembling feline grace, I thought it would not be best to have something interesting with pointy things on it.  Read a sad, sad thing in the local paper - an ad for a 15 year old shepard cross, free to good home. How can you spend fifteen years with a creature, feed it, shelter it, and then leave? I'm sure (I hope) those folks have good reason. I'm calling them later on today to see if I can take her home. I know Kurt and I aren't around a lot, but there are other animals around, and when we are home, we're most attentive.   It feels like I've been struggling a lot more lately. Everything is exhausting - driving to work, work, going out in public once a week. I want to stay in bed, and look at corners. I've not been diligent with my drugs, but I have been taking them the last three days, so now I'm keyed up, scared of Kurt getting into a car accident ever night he's on delivery, which is most nights. I dream about Lucas drowning, and I can't get to him. I don't like to shower, because I can't see through the curtain. I'm jumpy to the point of appearing on drugs, and hey, I suppose I am. It's becoming pretty obvious again why I wanted to stop taking the damn things, I seem to develop a medium-key anxiety that's around perpetually, and is bloody exhausting. Then again, as evidenced by the last little bit off prozac, thoughts of suicide, cutting, and other truly disturbing and depressing thoughts jump back into my head with staggering force and speed. It's a major case of The Giant's Drink, here. There's much support to be had, though, so it's not as bad as all that.

       So, last night watched "Bruce Almighty' with Pol, Pikey, and Kurt, and there was one scene in the movie that I was actually hoping would end because I was laughing so much, it was painful. Great movie, by the way, sappy, and freaking hilarious at times. Good date movie.  My landlord is sawing at brush as we speak. I've locked the doors,  made sure all the animals are in, and that all the windows are adquately covered, and now I'm hoping he'll disappear without talking to me, looking in any windows, or generally making me feel wildly uncomfortable.  Pol's back in the City now, it was great having her down, especially considering I made the excellent theft of a hoodie that she had rightfully stolen about a year ago. HAAAAAAAhahahahaa! I win the clothes game again! One thing I noticed about having her and pikey around is that I always seem to forget what a toxic, evil harpy she is when she wakes up. She manages to make every word she says into a vile, bloody epithet, and if looks could kill, you'd die before she even opens her eyes. Awfully fun to pick on though.  Our Phoebe must have gotten into a scrap of some sort, or had a run in with a door, as she now has absesses on her pretty body, and Kurt and I are beset with the horror of draining them. She's all right, though - she's eating, going to the bathroom, and drinking water at the usual frequency. Ahh, the animals. Life is good when you have  creatures around.  That's it folks. My life is dull.

      Okie, there were technical difficulties with posting on the blog...but I did save the entry.   It was supposed to be posted last week. F'n hell.  I kick off around three am, and here I am, tired as the proverbial dog, but can i sleep? Noooooooo. Instead, I wake up, ramble to kurt about "They Might Be Giants" and boot him off the computer so I can listen to geeky music from my misspent youth. And he didn't even have the courtesy to stay awake for my stroll down memory lane. I figure I'll take the CD to work, the girls simply must hear the song "Dead" (It's either I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want/ Or, I'm still alive, and there's nothing I want to do...) Not to mention the sheer artwork of "Istanbul", and "Someone Keeps Moving My Chair".  I keep dreaming about horses underwater. Last night, I had this monolithic, truly epic dream about an escaped princess who went nuts and killed her would be killers;  later on the princess turned into the Slayer, and then my character from Morrowind, but mostly, I remember watching the dream like a movie, and then getting directly involved when the main characters left their horse to drown. I had to get in there, and save the horse. Those bastards - the horse carried two of them to an island in the ocean, to exhaustion, and they didn't even try to get it on land. (For some reason, there were no beaches on this island.)  Pol is coming down sunday with the Pikey, and shelby the frisbee-catching wonder dog. Great dog, a little daft, nothing like The Lucas. For example, she's into playing and wrastling, Lucas is into basking, and receiving adoration. I think it will be great to have two dogs in the house again, even if it is just for a few days.  Oh holy hell, sleep would be awesome right now. I hate the exhausted feeling, especially when coupled with the ziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip feeling of my brain, the brain who clearly wants to leap out of my head, and go for a walk. I think my brain and body will have to at least try a trial seperation.  Prozac Nation let me know there is at least one person who has the same symptoms (well, of course, some are different), same worries, and same general outlook on that whole stinkass depression thing. For example, i was told by the plethora of doctors i saw that there was NO WAY I could have exhibited atypical depression (major) symptoms at the tender age of 8. You're supposed to manifest these symtoms around the ages of 19-24. There is at least one other person who exhibited these same symptoms at 11. It is quite possibly twisted and sad, but I have gleaned a fair amount of comfort from that, as well as the fact that Elizabeth Wurtzel was born in 1967, has a more severe case than I do, and, she's still alive. Ok that last bit not so twisted, but the first, perhaps a bit. That's what I need, i think, to know people survive this damn thing, lots of people do give it the recognition as an illness, not just some personal defect.   That's the big thing for me, seems like it always has been. I've been seeking legitimacy for this disease, and no matter how much I may get, there are still people who think I can just snap out of my 'mood', haul myself up by my bootstraps, and stop being so *weird* for Pete's sake. And then, I think, they're right, so many people have it so much worse than i do, why am I such a maladjusted fuck?   Maladjusted Fuck. Good name for a band, really.  It's 7.34am. No haikus today. Please feel free to write your own, and post them. Also, no word as to who is the bigger dork/nerd/geek, so come on, cast your votes now.

      aaah, bluh.  Was almost sorta kinda but not really fired from work on Tuesday. It's a long, agonizing story, so I won't bore you to death with it here. Suffice to say that Poppa is not only a prick but also a bitch, and I still have my job. Kurt, on the other hand, is out. He gave his two weeks, he's looking for other, part time work, and thus endeth the story.    Had a bath tonight, and Phoebe was interested. Being the jerkface that I am, i patted her with my wet hands. She Looooooooooooved it. Seriously. Kurt and I figured though, that she thinks I'm Mommy, and I was cleaning her off. It was extremely endearing, and now she smells minty fresh, if minty fresh smelled kind of like wet cat. God, I miss Fida. And Cordy...found the perfect sentiment for Cordy today, thanks to Fark:   Near this spot  Are deposited the Remains of one  Who possessed Beauty without Vanity,  Strength without Insolence,  Courage without Ferocity,  And all the Virtues of Man without his Vices.  This Praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery  If inscribed over human ashes,  Is but a just tribute to the Memory of  BOATSWAIN, a DOG  Who was born at Newfoundland, May, 1803,  And died at Newstead, Nov 18th, 1808.   I'd say something similar for Fida, except, well, it wasn't true. She was a snotbag in only the way a cat can. So the 'beauty without insolence' would be a definite exaggeration.  Animals are marvellous at being animals. Cats make perfect cats, fish are exlemplary fish, dogs are immaculate dogs.  Lots and lots of people are shitty humans. We're not animals, not entirely. We're not spirit, not exactly. We're not one thing or the other; not flesh, not fowl, not good red herring. It sucks.  Ok, been sitting in front of here for the last 20 minutes or so trying to think of something entertaining to write. Not gonna happen.

      Took sleeping pill at two am... Now i just feel like lightheaded insomniac.   Didn't do anything fun at work today, in other words; I worked with Poppa. If there's a mistake, I made it, he's always breathing down my neck, and working with him stresses me out. He doesn't have my back if it's busy, he's far too cool to talk with customers, even though I'm up to my eyes in stuff to do, and by the time i get back, stuff is ruined, it's my fault, make it again. And with the edgy paranoia thing, my lack of self worth feeling, going to work every day to face the guy is getting harder and harder. What I can't wrap my brain around is that I like him, he's fun to hang out with. Once he's at work, though, he powers up to Prick Mode. And, boy, does he love prick mode.  Kurt's again seriously considering quitting, and trying to talk me into it. He knows that he can't, in all seriousness, take orders from Poppa. Kurt believes, also, that working with Poppa is working on my brain in unhealthy, mental illness sorts of ways. I'm not entirely sure I can argue with him. Poppa does appear to be aggravating Zee Illness, but, on the other side of things, it may not be Poppa, it may be other factors, and if it IS Poppa, well, maybe I can get used to it. The terribly irionic thing is when I saw Doc, she was greatly impressed with my improvement, and ever since then I've been a sodden bundle of anxiety and waterworks. Maybe I jinxed it by agreeing that I thought I was doing better.   All right, I'm going to try to sleep. Wish me luck, send me mojo, and advice.

      Ye gods!  Tried the sleeping pill, and woke up around 3pm. Had an unfortunate amount of 'hangover time' however, and couldn't speak or have functional fine motor control for about three hours. Will NOT be taking them unless I happen to have three hours upon awakening to do my best impression of a vegetable undisturbed. Other than that, the pill worked great. Not sure yet as to how it relates to the excessive nervousness yet.  Didn't take one tonight, which, well, you know, explains why I'm tapping away at ten after five. I work with Poppa tomorrow evening, so the three hours of being a legume would open me up to ridicule and hollering from said Poppa. Besides, it didn't even occur to me to take it till three am, so, one's gotta ask. what's the point?  Thinking about changing the phone number. Is that cheating?  See, now, there was this woman I babysat for. She had her number unlisted, and it could not be requistioned by anyone, including the government. I'm sick of paid assholes calling me, even after I explain in explicit terms what has happened, that I'm real sorry, but fuck off, it's your mistake, do your homework. I would like, very much, to be inaccessible to these people by telephone. Still this is the method that woman used, and she is a criminal. Am I being a deadbeat, etc? Or should I keep up the song and dance routine?  We have quaretined Phoebe. She is unimpressed. I still have visions of Fida, and of Cordy, and I can't let Phoebe outside anymore. It is entirely selfish; I believe given the choice she would rather have freedom and risk death. I am far too weak to give it to her. (Kurt too.) But she's taken to meowing loudly, and pathetically, and she looks longingly to the outside, and all the dangers. Hopefully, when we get the kitten, she'll be too much in 'play' mode to notice.    The Poo summed up nicely where him, Kurt, myself, and many others are at financially: "At best, I'm in a position where I don't have to worry about starving to death.  And that's cuz i ignore my debts and live a couple notches above absolute poverty." That's about the extent of it. And Kurt's going to get further in debt before we can climb back out. My fortune favor the foolish, right?  Ok, going to go grab that insommnia by the balls.  Happy Birthday, Chad, you corporate pig.

      Ahh, yes, nothing like a pre-dawn swim, unless, well, it's in the ocean, and there's some sweet waves, and a few jellyfish to fling at friends. Anyways,  a good way to start/end a day.   Saw a doctor yesterday at the community clinic, and it was my family doctor. I've nto seen her in months, so it was fortunate I got to speak to her. She put me on some sleeping pills to battle the innsomnia. Like I said before, it's two hour naps at the most, and the Doc thinks that my lack of sleep and my anxiety are related. So, a ten day supply is at my disposal, and we'll see how the edgy lasts. if it does, then i trot on back and try something else. I'm not overly impressed with the idea of pills, but at this point, I've got to give it a go.   Man, I started this post thinking I had something to say, but my brain just shut off. So here's another excerpt from years-ago writing.   The girl walks in out of the sun. The shop has maroon carpet; movies fill every available space. The clerk sits at his usual spot, viewing one movie out of the multitude. The two know each other, once knew each other better, but now they no longer speak outside standard social pleasantries. Peering over top of her glasses, over movie shelves, she sees the back of his head, feet resting on a nearby counter. She turns away, browsing through the scores of movies, and trying not to think of the other across the room. People trickle into the medium-sized store, place watched movies on the counter, and exit quickly. The girl moves hair from her eyes, tucks errant strands behind her ears, curls in and out of movie rows. She makes a selection, places it upon the counter. The clerk pauses his movie. Blue eyes meet glass-clad brown ones. She is the first one to look down. She mutely hands over a bill, takes her change. Wonders during the exchange why friendships crumble � why this one crumbled. She turns toward the door sun marking a path between the girl and the outside. Then the clerk speaks not a good bye, but an inquiry. She turns, hoping that surprise didn�t register on her face. She answers slowly- he asks another question. The conversation rises. She doesn�t ask what she wants to, however. Decorum forbids it. The stage is not properly set. The conversation ends with the usual social sterility of a chat exchanged by strangers. The girl and boy stand quietly for a moment. The girl speaks then, reaches out with an invitation for coffee, already knowing the answer. She wonders as she speaks why it seems that the distance between them stretches even now, making him seem small, and indistinct - a person in the background of a photo. The boy says something. The answer, of course, is a negative. He�s tired, or busy, or some such, the girl can�t quite focus on the reason. They exchange meaningless formal parting language and the girl turns away. She walks on the trail of sunshine and into the blazing afternoon, closing the door carefully behind her.  That reminds me: I need to get new glasses. Been going almost 8 months without them, and I hate the 20/20 squint I've got to do to see things clearly. Our TV is 13 inches. Placed at the foot of the bed, the screen's sorta blurry. Irritating, but not hazardous to my driving or daily activities. Still, I think that's why I've not changed my driver's licence over. Another reason is I hardly ever drive. And, all the nonsense, paperwork and out-in-publicness is deeply unappealing.   Heh. I was just thinking about how vastly uninteresting my life is. Then, I thought: It could be worse - my life could be really interesting.

      I'm so hungry, I could eat a zickzaw.  Hot day at the palace of pizza yesterday, and the night was uneventful, save for the Glorious Confirmation that Lunkhead has been fired. Offically. 100%. I don't have to hear his whiny bitch voice on a semi regular basis. He's gone, baby, gone. And, there was much rejoicing.  In other happy news, I finally got black and white to work on this damn computer. More precisely, Kurt got the deed done. If I happen not to blog for a few days/weeks/months, it's probably because I'm playing with my sacred cow. (Right, that does sound perverted...)  Gave a statment to the cops, go to court in the fall if necessary. No one was hurt by the Drunk Guy. I think I'd feel pretty terrible if he had have hurt someone.I already feel derelict in my duties as a human since I didn't take the guy's keys. Anyways, no one is hurt.   And, my student loan has gone to collections. Again. Fuck them right in the ear. They used the whole good cop, bad cop thing on me, trying to convince me to ask my mom to take out a second mortage. Yaaah huh. They talked about going to small claims court, blah blah blah. I admit, I was initally quite upset, but Holy cow, I'm just not going to rob banks, sell dope,  my family, or myself to give them their money. Like I said before, I will pay it, but not until I'm in the position to pay for it. End of list, cats. My mom is fueled by a righteous fury right now, and hell hath no fury like Kathy's fury. After asking to talk to my mom on my behalf, and me telling the asshats that it wasn't a good idea, and continuing that stupid conversation for ten minutes, I told them "fine, go ahead. But she can't help me, she will not be happy hearing from you, and, quite frankly, I don't even want you to phone her." They asked me if i wanted time to give my mom a heads up. I said no, and phoned her anyways. The guy she talked to told her that I wanted her to mortage her condo. Mom said that she didn't think I said anything of the sort. Buddy went all postal worker, yelling at my mom, and asking her what kind of scam I was trying to pull, asking them to phone her. I reckon they were thinking that I told the truth when I told them I wouldn't be phoning mom to give her a heads up. The funny thing is, I wasn't going to, either, considering that mom can take care of herself, so assholes tremble before her. I had the sneaking suspicion though that those fucks would misrepresent me. I hate being right when it's shit like that. I can imagine my mom getting this call without a heads up, and the scenario would not play out well. Ultimately, she would believe me over them, that the last thing i want is to involve mom in my debt, but it would certainly cause friction. And the fragile trust we've built up would take a bit of a beating.   There's more to worth than either how much you make, or how much you owe. I'd like for me not to get into a funk about this, you know, have enough money to pay bills easily and suchlike - it's hard though. Feel like a deadbeat. I think i may have to consult a lawyer about this. Of course, this takes time, money, and at least half again the patience I have. Still, not sure I'm liking this. Considering changing my number. Not sleeping. Last time it went to collections, I had a breakdown, had to mess around with my meds so I wouldn't slice up my arms. On that basis alone, says Pizza Mama, I have a case against them, since it was their mistake in the first place that started all that jazz. Any lawyers wanting to give me a free consultation out there?  ....i really hate people.  Not you, of course. You're my favorite.

      Saturday was the worst work night ever. Poppa was on, he was cranky because Lunkhead is making his life more difficult. Kurt got yelled at by a cranky biatch, I was so tired I was gagging periodically. Then, the drunk driver came in.  I didn't know he was driving for sure until he got back into his car, but when I was talking to him, I got his name, and description, because, hey, I'm Hunch Girl. When he left I cranked into the dining room, me and Poppa discovered he was driving, and Poppa got his plate number. I called the cops. The drunk guy pulled into the center lane, hit a cab, went into a parking lot, almost sideswiped two oncoming cars on his way out of the parking lot, and destroyed some pylons. The cops came and took a statement from me. As far as I know, no one got hurt. I wish I was as confident as my hunches; I feel I really should have taken better action to ensure he didn't drive off. I mean, the guy was ossified; he only managed to say 'pizza', and 'slice' to me. In effect, it took him about ten minutes to order a slice. He had trouble standing without swaying. And I was almost positive when he came in that he was driving.   Kurt kinda sorta maybe not really wants to quit driving. The delivering is ruining the car. On a busy night, it's not peculiar to put on about 350kms, because the range of delivery is fairly extensive. He gets yelled at for mistakes we in the kitchen make, and he has to lift a lot of shit and do gruntwork. That wouldn't be all that irritating, save that he has a bad back, and he's been eating way more advil than is usual because of it.  Yargh, I say. But, the Powers that Be are still considering giving Kurt a stint in the kitchen. And that will be pleasant.   Still no decision on meds...Any thoughts?  The other thing; Kurt and I want to donate money to WAAG, and other charitable organisations. Of course, what little 'extra' money we have (The quotations are to highlight the fact that we NEVER should spend this money - it ought to go to bills) we spend on treats; ice cream, pop, junk food, and the occasional date. I'm selfish. i want to continue to buy these little treats because, they're treats, and we work nine hour shifts and we never do anything fun whiiiiiiiine whine whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneee. Giving the money away, though, has been discussed and agreed upon. We really ought to do it. The plan was to take tips and give it away. Hasn't worked so far. Seems very complicated, for such a simple matter - we said it, we should do it. Life keeps getting in the way, though.  I'm going to try and sleep. Wish me luck.

      I think I've figured out that feeling I've been having for what seems like months on end - that lost car keys feeling. It's more than boredom, and slightly less than fear. I think I just feel lost. Or homesick. I've got a few goals, namely get published, and write more, and really, that ought to be enough. It isn't though.  I feel as though I should be somewhere else, doing something else. God knows what. I've been thinking I need to volunteer at The Red Door (an organization that provides help and guidance to teens on sex issues), or at the SPCA, or, I dunno, do something to give back to the Valley that has become my home. Do Something Worthwhile. But I am lazy, there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day to have an adquate sleep and then drag myself off to work, let alone cleaning out animal poo, or whatever they'd have me do at the red door. There needs to be something there, though. At least, I think so.   I've also noticed during this period of self reflection that I'm a lot more scared of just about everything than I ever have been. When Kurt and I got lost the other night, I thought I could have induced a heart attack just on the thought of being lost. What's the worst thing that could have happened? We spend a night in the car, and asked for directions in the morning. I was still scared though. THen there's the thought of being put away,  because I'm just so bloody crazy. I have a deep unreasonable fear about getting pregnant. I feel, sometimes, that people are dead - friends I've not talked to for a while. Family members. You would think this would inspire me to call everyone, but there's the added on fear that if I do contact these people, they really will be dead. Right now they're in the  Schrodinger Cat Box in my head - safe, albeit static. Every car that passes by the store or our apartment is like little drops of acid on fraying nerves. I'm more at peace with that, speeders are on my Smite list til further notice. In other words, yeah, got a reason to hate and fear speeders.   But what about that other junk? Do i go to the wildly ineffective Shrink of the Valley, so he can toss more drugs at me? First impression: Hell No. But I have to concede that it's 98% likely that it's the fucking prozac working my brain into little worry knots. So, I could go to the doctor, and get put on something else, go through 3-6 weeks of hell and shit, and deal with new exciting side effects of a brand new drug.  Russian Roulette without the finality (hopefully). Maybe it'll be a cool side effect like weight loss, but most likely it will be memory problems, loss of fine motor control, dry mouth, changes in personality, thumbs rotting off... it's a gamble, basically. So is it to be the devil I know? I mean, I know I'm sick of being afraid to shower alone, and I used to love going for a long, pointless drives. New drug means new symptoms, or the slimmest of chances of no side effects at all.  Worth the risk? Or should I dance with the devil I know?   Maybe what I need is to go out, get dancing, be trashed for a few weekends. Put things into perspective. Have a little pub crawl, end up in a ditch or three. Be massively hung over, and regret all the silly things I said and did. But, just as likely, it will depress me huge, and point to how silly and meaningless my life is.   Thank God for Kurt, my family, (who needs to move here, damn it), my friends. My babies. They give me meaning, and the hope that I'm not going to be a wage slave forever. Man, I hope I'm talented, I'm far too lazy to survive this world of commerce.

      Ok, so, I'm a bit more calm now. Worked with Lunkhead, and he was downright submissive. We had good chats on controversial topics, he mentioned that he didn't think he could handle university; that he's too dumb. I don't like him. There are times when I want to like him, particularily after working with him, because, well, damn, he's an excellent worker when he's not an ass, but I'd have to say that Lunkhead is at least twice as smart as your average university student. He's young, terrifically daft, and a showoff to boot, and, I reiterate that I don't like the guy, but the fact that he thinks he's stupid is depressing, although enlightening - it certainly explains his show-offy daftness.   First year of marriage down, only, like 199 left to go. We went to dinner and an unmovie. Drank at dinner, I'm pleased to note that I am now a relatively cheap drunk. I was buzzing along nicely after two double ceasars. Kurt had two martinis, so we were in a similar boat. The first time I was ever drunk, I was twenty two, and six beers got me happy, and not hung over the next day, although I did have blackouts. Was drunk for the next year or two, and then pretty much stopped after getting picked up by the cops in my underwear. Now it's beer sometimes, wine even less, and ceasars twice in the last year. And it's easier for me to get drunk now than it was the first time. The unmovie was "Pirates of the Carribean". The theater was packed like sardines in a tin, so we moseyed off, got lost, and eventually went home. Movie later.   We are going to get a kitten/cat. This is not, of course, a replacement for Fida. But it would be a way of making a wrong thing better. There's a cat at the animal shelter who's eight. She needs a home. It's also kitten season in the Valley. The shelter was ridiculously full. There's a slight problem with adopting at the shelter, however - money. We simply cannot front the cash to pay for a kitten there- it's about 80 for a male, and a hundred for a female. The reason why it's so high is that the adoption fee includes the spaying/neutering of the animal, and its first round of vaccinations. I think it's a terrific policy, less to worry about in the long run, but Kurt and I are very much Mr Wendaling it. We're going to talk with the Humane society we're involved with and see if we can adopt, and hopefully house some going-to-be-adopted kittens. Last fall, before the onset of TV we had three fabulous kittens who eventually got adopted by kind people. They were at least twice as entertaining as the last season of Simpsons.  Every once and a while it hits me. I'm married. We're not even newlyweds. Fricken Kurt told everybody and her pet hamster that it was our anniversary, and much to my horror, the good folks at Jack Astor's made us stand on a chair while they sang the happy anniversary song. That song, by the way, is about as long and annoying as "The song that never ends". We got a muffin and a sucker, though. I was half cut, and that took the edge off my seething embarassment. Kurt giggled manically the entire time the resturant sang at us. I thought I was beyond embarassing - considering the years, and my traumatic childhood, I figured That was It. Nope. You know it's love when that particular person can make you near puke with embarassment. I guess it was revenge for those times I told everybody that Kurt squeezed me with his legs so hard I cried. (Those legs are skinny, but he's freakishly strong. or perhaps, just freakish.)  Been thinking a lot about control. I was listening to a song, and remembered singing class. Being able to sing is essentially not being tone deaf, and having control over one's voice. Gymnastics, dancing, martial art requires control over the body. Drawing is control over fine motor skills. All of these things also require a certain measure of control over one's mind. To succeed, to do something exceptionally well requires discipline - control. There's one exception that I can think of, though. I could be wrong, but I think the Arts may be that exception. Technique and learning the arts require control, but to actually tap into the arts, to be artistic requires a loss of control. I think of painting - highly skilled, highly technical, but at the same time, you might as well be painting walls unless you have the ability to relinquish control, and give over to the creative process. Writing, I find, is the same sort of deal. You got to let go of conventions, get all yoda-y with the unlearning, and go with the muses. Controlled loss of control perhaps?

      I think that I fucking hate people. No, wait, I *know* i fucking hate people.  Played D&D with the gang, and Muppet from work. She gave me the heads up that Gigantor and Lunkhead were laughing pretty hard about Fida getting killed. Found out later from Mama that they had actually planned to walk by Kurt, and say 'meow'. Apparently, though, before they said anything, they saw the gouges on his face, and decided otherwise.   I've got way too much anger happening. Kurt and I work with Lunkhead and his new paramour tomorrow. Joy. (No nick for her yet.) More antisocial fantasies abound, where I embed the pizza shovel into Lunkhead's skull. And, I was just starting to be able to be around him without daydreaming of violence. Now, thinking about her mangled body, and the thought that it could be funny to someone who sees us on a regular basis makes me want to projectile vomit all over the place, and have my head spin around. I felt bad for his silly ass when he might've got that chick pregnant. I could not be indifferent to something like this happening, but whatever, right? He's not me.  And ever time I attempt to go to sleep, or if there's nothing happening at that moment, I see her. She was so beautiful, and in death her face was caved in. She used to sleep in the tub , and she slept on the coffee table. She came to us on Kurt's birthday, when I was too poor to buy him a present.  And if that fuckhead was going the speed limit, she would not be dead. My husband came within hair's breadth of getting charged with assault, or worse. How is this funny?   I should not be ranting. I'm very grateful for Mama who came over to be with us, and Punner who undoubtably had a crappy visit with us sad sacks. I hadn't seen Punner in about five years. I could barely talk about anything else about what had happened, and how worried I was about Kurt - I sincerely wish we could have been at least slightly entertaining.   I'm sorry, i can't seem to talk about anything else.

      Guess I was being somewhat prophetic with that last post - things being shitty and all. Fida died last night. She was struck and killed almost instantly by a van. We were outside, Kurt was just dropping me home from work, I got off at 7pm. Fida was playing jerkface, and ran under the car. I always think that was her ploy to keep us from leaving. Anyways, she ran out from under the car, and was just barely on the road. Usually, she does this squeeze-and-crouch number when she's near the road - she had always been extremely road savvy. This time, though, she was startled, or lost her head, or something - she darted onto the road. I didn't see or hear the van until a split second before the impact. I had a crazy thought that she dodged the wheels. I mean, if any cat was smart enough to do that it was Fida. She knew her name, obeyed commands; she was brilliant.  Kurt chased the guy in the van down. I was on the road, sitting next to her as I did months ago, in the winter, with Cordy. Kurt screamed and screamed at the guy. Kurt, generally speaking, doesn't curse. He cursed a lot at the driver, called him a fucking asshole, and kept screaming mostly unintelligible obscenties at the driver. Kurt must've scared him; unshaven, blood running down his face (Fida had scratched him badly on the face and arms). I sat on the road with Fida until Kurt came back. I couldn't move. I had my hand on the fur of her belly. She had stopped breathing, of course, but she was warm. I made the mistake of trying to examine her. Old habits die hard, I guess, and I moved forward to close her eyes. Her jaw had been broken, and nearly torn away. I remember thinking that the fucker driver had not only killed her- he ruined her.   We were still outside when a lady came. She was in the van, and she came to tell us how sorry she was; that the driver was on vacation from Ontario, and he had tried as best he could not to hit Fida. I thought that was decent of her. There was something, though, that made me suspicious; she kept asking what exactly Kurt had yelled at the driver. It occured to me later that perhaps the driver and company were looking for a way to charge Kurt; uttering death threats or some such. Kurt didn't say anything of the sort of course, but he did almost attack the guy. He was moving in to hit him when he saw children looking out the back window of the van. Thank God for them, I'm not sure what would have happend if those kids weren't there.  I keep wondering if this is really what life's about; amassing horrible memories til your heart bursts. Fida's broken jaw, Cordy with blood leaking out her nose. Soon it will be people, right? Because that's the problem - over time everyone's survival rate drops to zero.  I think it's part of the disease (but it could be full on cowardice), but all I can think is that I have to get out of here now, away from people, animals, plants, everything, because I can't handle the loss. I'd say I want to drop dead, but there's a logic problem there; I'd be inflicting grief on some body else, and that's not right. But I would like to have people forget me, just kind of fade away while I move to a tiny island in the middle of nowhere.    I seriously feel like an ass. So many people in poverty, in fear, in agony and suffering, and I'm waxing dramatic about an end to a beloved pet's life; and end that was with very little pain, and a happy life before that. I still want to scream, though. I still want to wreak horrible revenge on speeders everywhere. I want to go to sleep, and then wake up with Fida licking my eyes, and Cordy farting. I want to punch through glass, through brick, through anything hard and unyielding.

      I have this habit, when I have nothing new to read. I re-read my old books. Problem is, since I zip through books like a greased ferret, I end up re-reading my stash a lot. I wonder if this mode of behaviour is counter productive. It's occured to me that re-reading could cause one to get locked down in thought patterns. Anyways. Reason why I'm thinking about it is because I just finished re-reading an ancedote about Darwin, and the process of him becoming an atheist. To sum up; he was doing his research thing, studying insects at this point. He came across a particularily nasty type of wasp. This wasp stung spiders. When it stung the spider, it layed eggs in the spider's body. Then, it left the spider alone, and more often than not the spider would heal up nicely. Then, the eggs turned into larvae, and burst out of the spider, killing it in what one can only conjecture would be a most painful and horrific death. Darwin evidently gave up on God after that. Can definitely see Darwin's point. I think, in times past, I would cite the spider and the wasp as fair proofs against the fact that either God does not give a shit, or there isn't a God to begin with. Now, I look at it another way. The spider and the wasp give fairly irrefuteable proofs that Things Are Not How They Ought To Be. The fact that I feel outraged and sickened by this tiny example of life's inequities suggest to me that I have an Idea of how things Ought to Be. Now, how did this idea get there, considering this is, in fact, how nature goes? I mean, it's not like I have any practical experience with Ideals, in fact, going entirely on what can be evidenced in my experience, life sucks, with moments of okayness, and more moments of ew and ickyness. And yet, this status quo isn't something I'm prepared to accept. I have this sense that really, there ought to be a better way for wasp eggs to gestate, and people should like each other, and atrocites shouldn't happen. The fact that I have these thoughts, if you're following along, and I'm being reasonably clear, is I rather think God put that idea in my head in the first place.   I am sick to deaaaaaaaaaaaaath of working for the public. When you're working in a medium-to-low end service job, people really tend to talk to you like you have the neural capacity of a head of lettuce. My view is quite fight club; service people are the backbone of society, and without them, you'd have nothing to eat, you'd be festering in your own trash, and nothing you owned would ever have a hope in hell of being fixed. Blue collar workers are the oil that keep things running smoothly. Do not fuck with them. Yeah, I know, I'm full of ranty, but holy shit, if another person asks me how long the slices have been out, I think I may have to jump across the counter and mortal kombat their asses. Lately I've been snide, asking if they ordered pizza often. Typically, folks say yeah. Then I mention how they eat that pizza for breakfast lunch or dinner the next day, so who gives a snail's keister if the slices have been out for 20 or 30 minutes? They're not dry, they certainly are moldering. Leave me alone. I would also like to mention that people who give me a hard time for shit I've nothing to do with have got to relax, sit down, and shut the fuck up. We're all working on what feels like to be on the mouth of hell, we're not making any serious coin, we're also crazy ass busy, do NOT call me and have my list off the specials to you, and do not rag on me because you ordered something that's three bucks, and we won't deliver it to you.   But, despite the ranting, I'm in a job that's satisfying, with enough hard work that you feel nice and tired, you aren't bored, plus there's not a lot of responsibility. There's fuckups, annoyances, and the bastard public, but it's fairly pleasant to be talking it up with smart people, drinking a few beers and making pizza. If I could just get out of the whole public bit, I'd be set.   Royal bank has called. Now it's a duder named Michael, and he left a message saying not to worry about ANYTHING, it's all going to be taken care of, no creditors, and that I should give him a call. I was all suffused with the milk of human kindness, but then, Admiral Ackbar whispered in my ear "It's a trap!" I should probably call the guy. "Yeah, hi. I work nights, so I'm not inclined to spend precious sleep time with Royal Bank. I've got no money to fix my credit rating, and I'm overwhelmingly tired of Royal Bank's foot being stuck up my arse. I'd love for all this to be taken care of, but Mike, buddy, let's be serious. I can't make rent, I'm not in any position to make student loan payments." Heh. What I should do is record the message, so that way I have proof they said no creditors. It's funny, I had the sick idea that Michael is really that fucker Marcus, who put on a fake accent so I'll talk to him. Mama and Kurt's paranoia are rubbing off on me.

      Since about first year university,  my sleep patterns have slowly flipped over, making me more often than not nocturnal. Now that I've spent a few months being nocturnal, evidently, I'm flipping it over again, so, theoretically, I may just eventually go back to having a regular night's sleep. (Haaa! last time I had a regular night's sleep was grade eight. I meant that I will start going to sleep around normal society's bedtime.) Before I get there, though, there is a problem. I can't sleep until about 1pm, and when you go to work at 4pm till at least 1am, you're one tired, tired pizza vampire.  In other news, scientists have discovered a cure to genius and criminal behaviour; leastwise in men. It's called marriage. Read all about it here:  http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,6729280^13762,00.html  Looked in the mirror yesterday, and decided to pluck out the grays. Moderate sucess, until I parted my hair another way. Flipped through my hair somewhat unbelieveing, to discover I'm gray all over - not uniformly gray, of course, but about 2% of my hair all over my head is devoid of pigment. It's not particularily troubling, but, wow. When I first strated getting grays when I was 17, it was all in one spot. I rather thought that the same deal was happening. Ironic really, since I look like I'm about sixteen and have the gray hair thing happening.  Read something interesting the other day: In a Fark forum someone had asked why 50s pinup girls had Very White skin. Another said that he was under the impression that as a society, we find what is beautiful is hard to accomplish. White white skin then was considered appealing because then the common person had a tan, becuase manual labour was the middle-of-the-road type of job. Later on, tans became appealing, because it indicated you were in a position to take vactions allowing for sun. I think this could also be applied to the fat/skinny problem happening now. In certain times, the more you weighed, the healthier you were; well, more accurately, the weathier you were - most people could afford to be fat. Now, we live in times where something healthy to eat is way more expensive than say, a burger, so skinniness is in. It's harder to be skinny, unless, of course, you've got the skinny genes. I think if I'm on the right tack with this it would also have implaications again of what we find attractive. The going theory is health is attractive, hence tans, curves, etc. But, I think that it's more that wealth is attractive. Sort of an ugly thought, really, that we may be just be as mercantile as all that. On the other side of things, it does in oblique way support the health thing. For instance, wealthy folks have better resources to maintain health. There's the Semi-Large thought of the day.  Been spending some hang time with the giraffe neighbour. Kurt keeps picking up that the dude has/had a crush on me. The neighbour is complimentary. (As a side note, Kurt's not threatend, likes the guy, etc. At the same time it's bit uncomfortable, and uncomfortable to me as well. Thing is though, it's done in such a way as not to be come ons, just niceness.)  At what point is that line crossed? Kurt has mentioned that a few people in the past has cornered and interogated  him about how he managed to marry me. He's of the mind that those guys are being vaguely disrespectful by mentioning such things, but judging by what those coversations said, it seems to me that the boys are being rather admiring of Kurt, a sort of pat on the back for a job well done. I'm starting to think Kurt has pretty unusual sensibilities about such things, or I do. At a wedding last year, one of Kurt's sisters-in-law was hugely and clumsily hitting on him, while I was around. It was about a month or two after we got married, and this girl did know we were newlyweds. It was even to the point where this girl was being overtly friendly to children I had previously befriended. I found the whole thing to be peculiar and humorous. Mostly humorous, though. Kurt on the other hand was filled with a full-on righteous rage - saying things to me such as "What kind of a man does she think I am?" and other similar questions.  I've been hit on a few times since our wedding, and I have to say, for the most part it's humorous. (Sometimes scary, because, well, I've always felt being hit on was scary.) But, on the other hand, should a person that knew myself and Kurt, knew that we were married, and crossed a line with me, I'd be murderous. It is, I think, only in these circumstances would I be pissed. If it were a guy friend, for example I'd have big betrayal issues, and so on and so forth. But since the girl at the wedding wasn't a friend, didn't know me, it was somehow okay, and sort of complimentary to me. Right. Got all that? Good. Now, tell me, does it make sense?

      Nicodemus says: What's new?  I say: very little, as a matter of fact... thinking i may win that most boring humanoid award  Nicodemus says: Well, you get out there, work hard, apply yourself and soon you may reach it. Well, I guess working hard and applying oneself would disqualify you.  By the way, about 95% of humans just go to work, play video games, and watch tv. You've got serious competition.  I say: ick...i don't like being human  Nicodemus says: Question - was it this boring when we were at University years ago?  I say:: no, i don't think so..  Nicodemus says: What's changed?  I say: dunno...got duller?    Nicodemus says: I have a theory that our perceptions have changed...but not the activities. Then = school, video games, movies, trips to Tim's.  Now = work, video games, movies, trips to Tim's.  I say: how have they changed, though?  Nicodemus says: Admittedly, you don't have me there to keep you entertained but still... We just suddenly see these things as dull and boring. It doesn't help that those idiots who make up the 5% are out traveling the world, rock climbing, and overthrowing governments. But who wants to do that really?  I say: i think the boredom may possibly stem from the thought that what ever growth i've experienced, i'm done..now, it's stagnation time  Nicodemus says: But you've done more than me over the past couple of years.   I say: yeah, but i think the novelty of Career has waned for you  Nicodemus says: Well, not really - I'm starting my own practice. But, that's besides the point. What's more exciting than starting a job, getting married, herding animals in a two bedroom apartment, writing a journal that gaining a serious readership, etc.. Jesus, I just realized that we may actually be doing more than years ago.  I say: so, what's the problem, then?  Nicodemus says: But you were the one that said you were bored and stagnating....stop confusing me.  I say: but my problem is i can't indentify the problem....pay attention   I'd say that I'm spinning my tires, but it's more like I'm idly wondering whether or not to put the key in the ignition. I feel sort of like I'm waiting for something, but Zod knows what, and I wonder if I'm wasting time waiting. But then, there doesn't seem like much I want to do either.  I think in school, it still felt like i was going somewhere, even though my marks were unnoteable, and my future was hazy. Now my future is not only hazy, but completely blank. Now What? Have a couple babies? Find a nice, high paying job that will annoy the life out of me inside a week? Or maybe I should just continue waiting. Wait for Kurt to finish school. Wait until something exciting happens. Wait for that kick to the ass I'm suspecting I'm needing.  I know, eventually I've got to get that last fricken credit to get my undergrad. There's problems there, though, finances, messes with student loan and royal bank. Say I get past these obstacles, and do the last credit. Then what? There are Universities that offer creative writing as a master's program. I know I would absorb a lot out of an endeavor such as that. But then, I wonder, am I good enough for that? Will it just be a matter of becoming qualified to teach creative writing, and not really write at all? Where am I going to drag Kurt off to next? Should he drag me off somewhere, because it's his turn? A while back, I was thinking cultural anthropology would be The Career for me. Not so much. The thought of travelling, of being uprooted, and without pets is not an option I care to deal with. Call me unadventurous, it's true, and that doesn't register a wet slap on my giveashit-o-meter. I'm not going anywhere until Lucas is finished with me, and that is final.  It's not an angry feeling right now. Not even a deep frustration. It's a vague sensation, like the feeling you get when you think - but you aren't entirely sure - that you're becoming nauseated. And there's a distant speculation as well, lots of maybes, what if's and hmms. It never gets intense, but it does promote, after a bit, an irritation much like when you've misplaced your keys, but you're damn postive you left them on the cupboard.  Inexplicably, they got up and left. You didn't touch them, you bloody well left them on the cupboard, so, where did they go?  So, i ask ask you, people: Where the fuck are my keys?

      bonjourno.  I've now become (again) one o the nerdlinger masses, as Sunday is now D&D day. We're talking hours of dice throwing, role playing, and general nerdage, and although I had reservations about starting up again, I'm now on that bad boy. I used to play when I was ten, with my uncle (who I knew, even then, was socially challenged) and his other, like-minded geek friends. We played every single day, that entire summer. The reason I sort of have bad connotations with the nerdage was, during that time, I was exposed in a slightly opague way that gaming was for the compulsive - the people that did it, as far as I could tell were into drugs, and alcohol, and although it was the highlight of my day to play, it still felt as though I was spending a lot of my time doing something fairly unhealthy. Played briefly in University, second year, but I backed out relatively quickly - it still felt unhealthy. (Even though these particular nerds were none prone to obsessive behaviour, much.)   But now, after this inital gaming session, I feel into it, and that it's not any different than any other game I like playing, and the people I play with don't have DTs, or the munchies,  or other not-so-endearing-compusions/obsessions, and none are all that soically inept. (Out of all of them, I may be the most socially inept with my pure hatred of crowds, and, well, people in general.) It's also one, maybe two days a week; hardly the all-encompassing nerdage of days gone by.  Survey question: would any be interested in reading of the nerdy exploits in story form? (I reckon it would take the form of a short story with commentary in parentheses)  If so, should I have a weekly installment here, or on another blog? Answer quick, people, so I can condense the first two sessions into one, given the interest is there.  I really thought one of the benefits of having the phone disconnected for a week would be that irritating people that are impatient to get our money would give up the whole calling us bit. It appears, however, that some are not as stupid as others. Ben Moss is still on our tail, although, for the time being, Royal Bank has given up on my deliquent ass. I am going to pay my student loan, kids, really. I had a service, I will pay. However, due to the fuckups and sheer assholery of the situation, and the people and Marcuses involved, I'm not going to, nor am I going to try, until the more immediate things are  taken care of, on a regular basis. This means paying our rent on time, and putting money on bills regularily. When that happens, then I will happily pay bits of my student loan. And, most likely, it will be in increments so small, I'll still be paying it off when the grandkids are earning their PHds. Nonetheless, it will get done. There is, of course, the thought that creditors will begin their calling on RB's behalf again, in which case, I feel legal action must be taken.  It is, because of a clerical error I had to start paying them as early as I did. (And they ate my credit, so now I couldn't get a store line of credit in a dollar store. They didn't fix this problem, and I still paid,  allbeit sporadically. I still have BAAAAAADDD credit.) And, it is because of another error that Kurt and I are behind in our rent, the fuckers took 1500 dollars of Kurt's student loan. (Which is illegal, but I digress.) It is, I think, primarily because of this that we are still behind on our rent, because, hey, that's where the frigging money was supposed to go. At this point, though, we're only one month behind. We're ok finances wise, not on top, but at least climbing to the surface. Kurt's marks are wonderful, we can assume the University will give us a hand. After all, they looked at his marks, and lent us the laptop for the summer, free of charge.  We had our first friday and saturday nights off in a while. Unsurprisingly, there isn't much difference having the weekend, as opposed to weekdays off. Still, it was nice. We missed the two most sweaty busy days, so, no complaints. On tonight, with the abscence of Mama - she's got a date with Papa. I'm working with Muppet. I leant her my autobio of Leonard Nimoy "I am Spock". I hope she found it as funny as I did.  Anyone else surprised it's July? Freaks me out, I keep on thinking we're due for another snowstorm.    Oooh, yeah: I tried being a fun fearless female a la cosmo yesterday. I covered our balcony all up with blankets,  more so than I usually do, slid a biiiiig board over the top of the stairs so it was completely enclosed and Lucas could keep watch and, for the first time, I sunbathed naked. Of course, I was freakishly paranoid, and managed to stay naked for all of thirty minutes, but hey, I did it. And, I may just do it again. For longer, even. Maybe. Hmm. Might not. More consideration has to be undertaken. I mean, I knooooooow I can't be seen, and I know Lucas woud give me warning as soon as someone even entered the driveway, and if not I'd hear them on the first stair up, but still; I'm freaking naked.   Naked sunbathing Should not be taken lightly Burnt boobs hurt a lot.  Exposed on the porch Obsessing over my fat ass Feeling very much nude.  Nudity is like Picking one's nose a whole lot Comfortable, but, well...

      Hello kids,  With that inspiring ultimatium from Minako, I'm now on the mend flu wise. (I think the timing may be coincidence, but that's neither here nor there.) Still boogery and all cough like, but it's disappating.   Got a new delivery driver at work, we'll call him Gigantor. He's polite, is a keener, and he's clean,  I've got no complaints. There's a few new girls on as well, so far they've been nothing but fun to work with, so All is Going Smoothly. Well, I almost got eaten by the Meat Freezer yesterday. Damn, I am short, and there is nothing that highlights it better than work at Mama's. I can't change the staff paper towel dispenser, I can't put a slice in the oven and have it remain round, or even remotely roundish, (a slice is the biggest ass pizza we make, we sell it by the slice, hence the imaginative name) and occasionally, the freezers try to eat me when I attempt to retrieve something from their frosty depths.  Summer is happening, which makes me happy. I'm lead to believe I really ought to live somewhere that's warm all the time, near an ocean. People are optional. Beaches, on the other hand, are a necessity.

      So, my phone was disconnected, I got the fu from hell, and things have been basically sucking ass. That's all right though, all has been rectified, save for the flu. There was no announcement or warning to the phone disconnection, incidently, it just sort of happened. The good thing about it was that I wasn't awoken by ringing phones in the wee hours (For you daytime dwellers, that would be morning and mid afternoon.  The anniversary is coming up, on July 16. We were hoping to get to PEI for the occasion, but I think now we'd settle for just some quality non-sick flakage time.   I'd write more, but i realy got to lie down.

      Went to Yum bakery today, but before that, had a bout of nervous stomach; almost didn't make it. In the end, though, I preservered, and happily went I to make hermit cookies and whoopie pies. They are a bakery that does bread, granola, cookies, muffins, and spreads of the nutty variety. Not sure about cakes, but didn't see any. Boss guy is nice, high strung, but nice, and not an idiot, which is a bonus. A negative, however is that he just may think I tumbled off the tuna truck. He tried pop quizzing me with multipication tables. I spazzed, and didn't even get one right. (He even asked me what four times twelve was, and I stuttered a lot.) I explained that I used to have panic attacks during math tests, I think he was pretty understanding, but it was baffling even to myself how much my brain didn't want to work for me. 4 times twelve. I fricken said twenty-four. The other folks in there were really nice, and they all are people who read, which I've never experienced in a workplace before. Back home, people would look at you like you sprouted an extra arm on your forehead if you carried a book around, let alone carried a book around whilst you were at work. The guys were reading "Dr Zhivago", and "The Lord of the Rings". The fellow that was reading the latter turned out to be a big geek, too, he's all about the nerdy, fun things in life. I didn't mess anything up, and I was fast at what I was doing. It seems, overall, to be a good, quiet place to work.   That's pretty much the extent of my excitement for today, 36 bucks richer, and the Boss guy will let me know either way if I got the job in a few days. Upon meeting boss guy, I'd have to say that him being a bitter bitter man was not entirely correct, but I do not think i was too far off; he seems like a guy who's been profoundly disappointed, and although is mainly content, is probably prone to self pity and freak-outism. If I get the job, he'll be certainly an interesting person to observe.  That's it for me. Not overly interesting, I know, but hey, there is that curse to think of. I'm just peachy with a side of keen on not being interesting.

      Poor Lucas is suffering. He's not shedding anymore, he's been full-on moulting. His skin is dry, he's itchy, his nose has been running. I've been telling folks that he's allergic to people, and putting baby lotion with aloe on his tenderer bits. The unfortunate thing is that he rather enjoys the taste of the baby lotion. We've been able to work around it by making him stay in the same room as us and not letting him eat it. It's been partially sucessful.  Phoned a place called Yum bakery yesterday morning; they'd like to see me on Wednesday for an interview, and possibly a bit of a day's work. No experience is necessary, and the pay is slightly above minimum. And there will be baking involved (This part is key). I talked to the boss guy, and I have to say that he seems a bitter, bitter man. He spent an inordinate time telling me that it is really important to show up on Wednesday. He highlighted this because three canidates or so have phoned to apply, then flaked out on the actual interview. He sounded like he got dumped. I suppose I'd be pissy too. The bakery is not the place I've applied to umpteen times, this is fresh blood.   Whooo Guy was out and about this evening, that asshole. I keep drifting from window to window in the apartment, wondering where I'd get the best shot. I figure on the roof of the laundry building, but there's this tree...ok, I don't really want to shoot him. Maybe just throw big rocks at him. Or smack him with paintballs.

      It's bloody cold for August the last few days, ironically, the cold seeped in when my neighbour had his air conditioner installed. Environment Canada says to expect frost in low lying areas next few nights. It's weird for this place; the heat usually lingers until late September. I find it nice, though, I'm glad Fall is showing up; it's my favorite season. It's not too cold, there isn't any snow, there's a freshness about the air that has no spring muddiness attached, and there aren't any insects to speak of. Twilights last longer. And there is a clarity with the fall - you can see the stars better, and everything seems cleaner after the stickyness of the summer. Did I mention the lack of insects? Yeah, no more scratching myself to scabs.   A friend of mine used to wear a shirt that said "Time Flies When You're in a Coma". I can't wrap my head around the passage of time; I guess my parents weren't kidding when they said time speeds up as you get older. It's been almost a year to the day since I've seen them. A year living in this sometime moldy, terribly unlucky apartment. A lot of friends/family say we really ought to haul ass back into the City, as we seem to have had a stretch of bad luck that can only be described as monolitic. Kurt's mom in particular believes our string of misfortune is a sign that we should not be here.  I'm not entirely sure what I think, but I know what we want, and that is to carve out some time here, rough as it may be. The University is good to Kurt, and promises to be better as he improves academically. He likes it. I like it here. I'm close to home, I recognize the change in seasons, and while I'm close to the University, I can't entirely give up the thought that I'll be back taking classes, and I need that particular optimism.  Kurt got a reply from student loans; they said that he must write and let them know how we're going to cover a shortfall of 2000 dollars or so. If his reply does not hold under scrutiny, the Powers will not give him funding. I read the notice and thought their phrasing to be moronic; the gist of it was how they hate to see a student withdraw mid-year due to lack of funds. So, they'd rather not give any than have Kurt take half a year. Made me think of late fees. "So, you can't pay your bill? We're just going to go ahead, and add more money to it, since you might be able to pay a larger amount than the smaller we orginally charged."  I have a plan for covering this shortfall, but I'm not going to divulge until I know it's going to work or not. It's a silly superstition thing. If I go public about my plan, it won't work. If I'm silent about it, it might. It's not anything illegal, so don't worry your purty little head.

      Yeeeeeeeah.  The computer done deaded on us; we lost our whole friggen hard drive. I don't know what they had to do to fix it, I do know they had to retemplate it four times, but I do not know what  other sort of technical voodoo had to be done to resurrect this silly machine. My portfolio, Kurt's stories, saved games from black and white, as well as icewind dale are gone, so are the movies I had collected, and the music. Brand new drive now, waiting to be corrupted by my grubby, semi-compuliterate hands.  As utterly irritating as this may be, there is a silver lining. I need a new portfolio, right? Now I have the time, the stories, and the will to write is beginning to arise because my shit's gone. Good. Now to shake off the cobwebs and get going.  Still no job, tomorrow I pass out resumes targeting the food and service industry. Ye gods! But, I figure, tips would be fabulous. I'm enjoying the time off, when I'm not being completely spastic about bills. There still is a problem with righting my backwards sleeping schedule. I can't seem to manage staying up twenty four hours to correct it; and before when I did that, I suffered, and the new sleeping schedule didn't take.  I've got no amusing stories at this time. Bed now, hopefully sleep like humans do.  G'night.

      Watched "The Thin Red Line" this morning with Kurt; very good movie if you feel like getting into the head of soldiers. I really like it; it's thoughtful and disjointed, mixed with moments of disgust and compassion, and a lot of fear. I would think that would be how an individual would experience a war. I think I understand a little better why it is the military so diligently brainwashes their recruits - otherwise, they'd be running to the hills to save themselves rather than, say running into enemy fire, all cannon fodder-y. Makes me think of ants, really. The way ants are set up would probably be ideal for the military; no indiviuals, protect the queen at all costs.   I would suck at being a soldier. Got major commitment problems, I dislike authority intensely. Dying for my country seems rather laughable, and there's that whole lazy thing. (Dying for your country is fine. Really, though, as of late, you're dying for your politicans, and that's just incorrect.) Makes me think of sports teams. In high school, I joined a few teams to have something to do rather than anything else. I'm not competitive, but in those days, I was not lazy. I wasn't very good at them. I was recruited for rugby in my first year, though, and i refused. Basically, I didn't want to drink, and if you're a rugby player, you may do that a shade more than actually playing the game. The other reason was that you were expected to go to every practice, whether you're sick or injured or whatever. Commitment problems. I have a deep seated need to not do what I'm obliged to, soley based on the fact that I'm 'supposed' to do it. If someone asks me for a favor, I will, if possible, bend over backwards to accomadate. (I need to be needed.) However, if something has to be done because it's expected, or someone tells me (or implies) I must, I won't do it, or, at least, do it under great duress. For example, when I was in residence, there were 'mandatory' floor meetings. I never went, unless the RA personally came up to me and asked me to go. Then, I guess I felt that it was ok, that I was needed to go. Weird, really. Never noticed how pathological this contrariness was until I started dating Kurt, and realised that if he said something postive "I love it when you rub my back," I'd avoid doing that particular thing unless he asked me. The fact that we got married at all suggests to me that he is a most persistant individual, and that I may be growing out of being contrary. At least, I hope so. How insane is that, that I can't comply with orders or suggestions? I don't think it's because I'm proud. (I hope I'm not proud...)  The loudmouth guy was silenced this evening. I believe other pissed off neighbours, faced with another night of the asshole yelling his face off, called the police. Cool. I've called the cops now twice in the last three weeks, I have no desire to keep doing so.     Commitment problems. Wow, did I have bunch. Still do if I think hard enough about it. I mean, there were a lot of nice boys saying nice things to me way back there. But, I refused them, told them off, scared the living crap out of them, and went after the ones that were mostly inaccessible because, hey, little risk of actual involvement. When involvement became an issue, I disappeared. When they cooled off, I'd resume my admiring. It must have been utterly infuriating.   You know, maybe that's why I'm not writing. I've got the time, I've got the stories. I'm just not DOING it. Commitment problems? (Laziness?)

      An Open Letter to an Unidentified Neighbour;   Shut up. For the love of God, and all that is Holy, shut up. For my peace of mind, shut up. For avoidance of spending time in the drunktank, shut UP. I'm sick of you, and your 'parties' that last until three in the morning, and mainly consist of you and your buddies yelling obscenities, and occasionally smashing bottles. I'm sick of the 11am wake up call - you screaming "Whooooooo!!!!!" I'm sick of you, and your ability to speak.  Frankly, although I've never seen you, don't know your name, or any personal infomation, you inspire a tremendous amount of loathing from me. I've already had numerous fastasies where violence done to you is the prevailing theme. I wonder if you go to university, and the thought that you might, inordinately depresses me. The fact that I hate you depresses me. Your volcabulary depresses me. Please, do me a favor, stop the hate, and shut up.

      At several points in my life, I believe I was under the delusion that i am a 'people person'. I've noticed the last few days that the unifying motif in my life is that I real am not a people person. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like malls, stores, bars and other places where people congregate. In updating my list of jobs and suchlike, I realised almost all my jobs have had to do with me dealing with the public. I was a lifeguard, a tour guide, a kiosk dork in a national park. Met a lot of cool people in those jobs, but there were an overwhelming amount of people that were fricken tards. I'd like to think that I'm a tolerant person, but perhaps when it comes down to the simple meat and potatoes of the matter, I have a tendancy to be intolerant of people I find to be irretrieveably stupid, and people who are intolerant. So, demographically speaking, the type of person I'd most likely want to kill during a rage would be a ditzy racist. So, you know, golfers.  The jobs I applied to today were retail, with the exception of the baker job. Mojo, people. You want cookies, right? I don't want to work retail. Aggh. The mere thought of morons not understanding things like prices or store policies makes my hair hurt. Maybe it's not so much people, but the masses that I've come to dislike intensely. The consuming masses in particular.   Great Zeus' kidneys, but I am cranky. I'm trying to go back to being a day person, it's working in the way that it isn't, and retail, or some hell similar seems to be my lot in life.

      Went blueberry picking on monday. Tried to get up Tuesday morning and flopped back down like a big dead fish. In short; we came, we saw, we picked, we slept, we paid the price. Picked 230 pounds of blueberries, which evidently isn't bad for the sparsely berried patch we were in. On a mature field, a person would easily get twice that.   We did get a hundred bucks out of it, likely that will go to advil, and muscle relaxants. Who would've thought that squatting, and creeping along would cause torrents of ridiculous pain, but it certainly made sense; i've not ever spent that much time stooping. I'm definitely not used to squatting for nine hours a day. Stoop, squat, rake rake rake, shuffle, repeat.  Kurt's in the same position, that postion being moaning when movement is required. I told the farmer guy we'd give it a try next year, provided we're in better shape.  Saw a job posting just now that involves taking care of puppies for 24hrs a week. Going to call tomorrow about it, find out why they aren't offering full time work. The place is a kennel/farm for llewellin setters - a very pretty type of bird dog. Here's the job description:   "Prepare food and feed animals, Clean and disinfect cages, pens, aquariums, kennels, runs, stall and enclosures, Assist animal breeders to handle and nurture animals, Monitor and document animal behaviour."  Now, I know the cleaning and disinfecting is not all that appealing. But, to be around dogs, and a lot of them for extended periods of time would be definitely up my alley. I'd be quite happy, rather ripe smelling, but happy.   You know, I rather think I have a mushy head.  If I had to choose between dealing with people or cleaning up dog shit eight hours a day, give me a pooper scooper. I keep thinking;  I have to set my standards high, get a job that has something at least marginally to do with my education. Or, a job high paying enough that I can continue to pay for my education. But no, I'm having poop scooping fantasies. (To be fair, I am going to look into learning the trade of dog breeding, finding all about it as a business, and what one has to do to become a trainer and so on and so forth, but really, I do want to play with dogs.) I want a job where I don't have to talk to very many people, where I do not have to sell shit, and something that involves using my mind, or my emotions. Ideally, using both emotions and intellect. Sounds an awful lot like a writer, doesn't it? I also want to play with animals, learn how to make/bake/cook stuff, and, well, just plain learn.  Any ideas, advice, etc? (Don't say 'go back to school, ya loser!' I can't, not until a chunk of this loan gets paid off, or I get some serious coin.)

      Last shift at the pizza place was last night. 11 hours. Will not be missing those. Even if it's a good night - and it's Friday, and it's drunks, so, never that good - it's 11 fricken hours. Could barely drag my ass in and out of the shower. Drank some brazilian beer, it's like Corona, and 4.5%, very pleasant. Nothing overly exciting happened in said shift, we were semi-busy, and, we all took quality time at various points in the evening to either stand in front of the fridge, or sit next to the air conditioner.   Today is sleepy time. Kurt finally managed to fall asleep around 11am today; I was doing better, i fell asleep around 8. He's doing better now, the jerkface is still asleep, and I feel like the newly-animated dead. It's sad how jealous a person can get of a loved one. I am deeply resentful of the fact that Kurt can fall asleep and stay asleep anywhere, any time, any position. When he moaned and wailed about being exhausted and not being able to sleep despite, I welcomed him to my world, and smirked. (HA! See how you like it, punk!)   Start blueberry picking monday, at 8am. Should be a healthy adjustment to my schedule, if I don't die in the re-adjustment period. The job lasts about three weeks, and we're guarenteed fifty bucks a day, which will be all right for the bills and so on. I saw that bakery job posted again on the job bank website, and I'm going to apply for it again; maybe third time really is the charm. Solace may never believe me, but I miss those early mornings from the golfcourse. An added bonus would be that with a bakery setting, I wouldn't have to mow greens. And, with ose hours, I wouldn't have to talk to people. An ideal setting, I think. Send me happy thoughts; if i get the job, I'll make you cookies!

      Got a phone call today from a farmer that wants Kurt and I to pick blueberries for him. I'm going to give him a call later on, find out the vitals of the situation. He mentioned on the message that the fun begins monday. It could be nice, outside for the rest of the summer, not to mention getting eaten by flies while being sunburnt doing back breaking labour. Yo ho! Well, we will see, anyhow, the sooner we leave the store, the better. It feels like an impending breakup, or nauseousness - want to get it over and done with, cleanly and quickly.  It was stickier than a Situation in the kitchen tonight, and comepletely unbusy. The highlight of the night was finding a MommyCat on the side of the road whilst driving Delicious home. Kurt, Delicious and I spent the better part of an hour trying to determine if the MommyCat was a stray, and where her kittens were. No luck determining either, and the cat went home with Delicious. Tomorrow, a search will be made. I'm sort of hoping for a kitten, or perhaps MommyCat herself. Selfish me. I wanted to take her home tonight. Unfair to her, of course, not to mention her family, both people and feline. (Assuming she has the people bit - she was in good shape, but reaaaaaaal skinny.)  I studied Philsophy in university, and I hate, loathe, de-fricken-spise debate. I wonder when that happened; I used to lie in wait for unsuspecting Mormons. I took an inordinate amount of glee running them about. I was a mediator for Philosophy Society. I was all about the debate, the thrill of the point well made. Not so much anymore. I have an internet friend who tried to debate ethics, the existance of God, and so on and so forth, and I find I really don't have the stomach for it anymore. I'm not learning anything from these debates, and my friend is certainly not broadening his world view, either. It's pointless. That would not have stopped me previously. Debate for debate's sake, and all that. Guess I'm getting older, and more mellow. Fine by me, really, in essence, all I seem to get from debates I've had in the last year or so is a severe case of irritation. And, unlike thoughts previous, i'm way more interested in finding out what another person thinks, rather than attempting to bend them to my way of thinking. Right now, I don't give a wet slap whether or not they think my beliefs are even credible. Mellowing out? Or getting lazy? You be the judge.

      I slept longer than two hours without meds!   Tomorrow, I conquer the world!  No news or excitement today, it's bloody hot and humid and sticky and raining on top of all that, no relief to be had. But the heat humidity and so on and so forth might be responsible for my excessive sleeping, so giddyap.  Had a dream in the form of eavesdropping this evening. I was in the head of a native girl who was widowed, at a sort of memorial service, a year or so after her husband's death. She's not all that welcomed there, she's only half native, and there appears to be something else going on, as well. There's a man there she knows, Johnny Stormcrow, who was her husband's friend. Johnny and the husband are quite a few years older than she was. She sees a man there, about her age, and he takes her hand when everyone came together for a circle. On the other side, there's a woman who hates her, and wouldn't take her hand. People chuckle at her, and she pulls away, and boots on out of there. I got out of her head for a minute, and the fellow who was holding her hand speaks briefly to Johnny. Johnny tells him to follow the girl, he  agrees; he was going to anyhow - he's facsinated by her. This guy happens to be Johnny's son, Johnny Jr. Basically he catches up to her and follows her home, and they tell each other stories. They're kinda sorta falling in love I guess, and I woke up just as they were on the outskirts of the reservation, close to her place. I know a few other things about her -  she married into the reservation, so she's an outsider, and the man she married was extremely popular, I reckon the girl stole him away as seen by the girls in the reservation.  So where the hell did THAT one come from? Good story, i think, anyhow...I want to write it out. And, speaking of writing, Kurt reallllllllllly wants me to write about Paul's place, and all the crazy that went down there. My grandmother, paul's sister is coming to visit, and i know she can tell me more about the house and its stories. It's funny, i made the decision to 'be more of a writer', and at least three stories plop in my lap. Now, the only thing is to get the disipline to write every day. Yeah, I write here, but i think that uses a different part of my brain.

      Yeah, well, according to Poppa, Kurt and I are in a cult, we steal cigarettes, I called in sick because I was moving things with my mind, and undoubtably I'll hear more colorful bullshit in the days to come. He's won, I gave my notice, because Mama told me that this is unlikely to simmer down, and, if I chose to stay, she believes Poppa will drive a wedge in our friendship. Rather than see that happen, off I go to greener pastures, or something.   Yeah, I'm pissed. But I am pretty convinced this isn't the hill to die on. I like working at the place, I enjoy and care for the people I work with. Had problems there, but yeah, no situation is going to be ideal.   The funny thing is, I still don't know what I did to piss the guy off so much. Kurt's convinced that Poppa has the fucked up idea that Mama and I are going to run off together, and there are some things that Mama said that back that up a bit. I had no idea, though, that he'd be such a bitch. He took things said in confidence by kurt about my illness, and made them into a joke. I'd like to think I'm pretty open about being depressed, about having weird thoughts, and trying to avoid weird impulses. I was not prepared to be on the ass end of Robyn-Is-Completely-Fucked-Up propaganda. And, of course, I'm feeling pretty wrong, and sick, and very very crazy. The power of suggestion, huh?   Hey, Granger, mojo to you mmmkay? Don't let the bastard kids beat you down. I'll go get my bat, we can have a Camper Bashing Day.  Bah! I'm bummed. I need chocolate, and some hired goons. Not to mention money to pay my bills, and a job that gives me some measure of personal satisfaction. Anyone with any information regarding these matters will have my undying gratitude. (What an odd word, gratitude.. sounds like a form of processed cheese.)

      It's raining. Was thinking "damn, it's raining, can't go to the lake," but since I only just woke up, I suppose that the rain is a good thing - at least I can't bitch about wasting another perfect summer day in bed.   Not working tonight, though I am scheduled in. Mama told me and Kurt to 'skip this one', as poppa's ire is still pretty ireful. It's only four hours, I guess, but it's the start of more hours lost since Mama thinks it best to avoid any confrontation for the time being. I agree with her, but I keep on thinking that it's ultimately stupid to continue working there. How long can I dodge Poppa? Why the whooping fuck should I even have to? Thing is, I don't even know what I did to piss him off in the first place. He's not talking to anyone about it. No one knows what I did to piss him off, which is pretty durn peculiar at work; usually someone knows something; and even more often everyone knows everything. Kurt thinks that Poppa was offended when I called in sick the other day. Poppa knows I don't like working with him, but the sick thing was really a sick thing, allbeit not a cold or flu.   Ahh well, it'll all come out in the wash. Or something.  The peace that has come with the change in numbers is extraordinary. I figured I'd be more relaxed, but holy cow, I'm pretty much blissful. The only possible canker left is that they do have my folks' number, and that is entirely uncool. However, my mother is the type of lady who truly enjoys telling people off, in particular, telling people who threaten her young in any way, shape or form off. I get my need to be needed thing from my mom. When people need her, she flourishes; I've never seen anyone so tough.   Applied to a photo place, alas, I applied with an unupdated resume, so the number is wrong. Left a slightly rambling message to inform them of my new number. Going to have to go down to visit them to explain further, I think. Besides, it will give me the oppurtunity to beg, wheedle and cajole for their job. The job is a general assistant type person, and there are plans for this assistant type person to become rather trained in photography, and film development.  There's likely to zillions of people applying, and I sort of doubt I'm qualified, but pllllllllease oh pllllllllllllleaaassseee give me this job, Lord, and I promise to be a very good girl. And an exceptional photo shop assistant type person. I love the idea of getting trained to do stuff, and photography is cool, and appealing, and I know I can be good at it. Dad had a slick ass minolta when I was growing up, I always wanted to master it. And the idea of developing one's own pictures - well, suffice to say, i really would like this job.

      Went to get my depo shot today. Despite all the amazingness of depo, it's still a needle every three months, in the ass, and I invariably awake the next two days feeling like I was smacked around with a large stick, after running a few kilometers. But, no period, which means no Cramps of Doom, and, hey, you know, bleeding every single month was not my idea of a good time, anyways.  Yesterday was my dad's, and Kurt's mom's birthday. Non-eventful in the celebrations, or so I hear. Did talk to members of the Clan I like, which was nice. I kept thinking how peculiar it was to have one side of the family be pleasant but distant, and the other side, well, lots of descriptive words pop into my head to describe my deep seated ire with the other side of the family, but none are terrifically apt. I love them, they're family, the make my teeth itch and hair hurt just thinking about going to visit them. Yeah, that sums it. Anyways, I find it surprising that one side of the family can cause ulcers, whereas the other side simply does not. Then, it surprises me that it surprises me. Sounds rather like I'm surprised frequently. That's surprising...anyways.  Got the book "American Gods" by Neil Gaiman. Yowza, kids. It's one of those take-to-the-bathroom books, causing hunger and eye strain because it somehow will not be put down. Yeah, I realise I put it down to write this, smartass, but the *sentiment* is true; I keep looking over to make sure it hasn't walked away or anything.  Here are some thoughts, suggestions, if you will, on how not to make the staff in a pizza place want to kill you:  1) Thou shalt not ask how old the slices are. (Fuck, man, you eat cold, day old pizza for breakfast. Why is it suddenly a bad thing to eat a slice that's been in a heated box for thirty minutes?)  2) Thou shalt not choose thy individual slice. ("Yeah, I'll take the third one from the left, on the middle rack, no no, your Other left,")  3) Thou shalt not take more than three slices upon a single order. (unless you're planning on coming on to the back room and making us a new one...)  4)Honour Thy Cashier, and Thy Pizza Cook (We work 9-11 hour shifts. We have more customers than you. Do not get all drunk and belligerent, and complain because you got coke instead of pepsi. We gave you a deal, we work in a furnance. We feed you. We bring the food your your bloody house. Drink the damn pop and shut up.)  5)Never shall you darken the shop's door early and demand thy order. (20 minutes is waaaaaaaaay different from 5 minutes. When we say 20, we mean twenty, and it really will not pop out any earlier because you've graced us with your presence.)  Aaah, that's enough for now. I'm feeling that fatigue thing, so I'm going to see if, indeed, I'm experiencing better living through chemicals.   Anyone know why you're only supposed to use draino twice? I wonder if the pipes will explode otherwise...

      If I had have done what I said I would do, it is very likely that I would be at work right now. I've noticed, though, that things hardly ever work out they way I want them to, or at least the way I intended.   After much deliberation with the husband type, I decided not to take the job with the bakery. Here's the thing: in addition the crap i mentioned earlier, i had the stunning realisation that I have to be unemployed in order to be eligible for the disablities fund. So, it was either take the job, and forgo finishing my degree, for a job that'll give me nine hours a week. Added to which, ever since I found out I got the job I've been in a nightmare, not sleeping, crying, and simply waiting for that other shoe to drop. The very thought of work had me paralysed. I suppose it doesn't say much about my work ethic. I got to thinking about the pizza place, and how eventually it got to me, the selling dishes door to door, and how that got to me, and basically, how everything has been getting to me, eventually allowing myself to spaz. Maybe, just maybe, I'm breaking that idiotic cycle by just waiting, and recovering, and, uh, recovering (navel gazing).

      I know I've been writing less in here. Consider it a good sign, though - I've less to whine and moan and complain about. No word on either Disabilities Fund or the morons who staff the Student Loan office. We got fifty bucks worth of groceries on the good graces of my mom (who got older yesterday), and I finally heard back from the bakery. Evidently, I was not their first choice, considering I came off as a complete and utter moron. God. What's 4 times 12?  24, says Robyn-the-Genius. Anyways, they are offering me temporary, part-time work. About 9-12 hours a week, for the next six mondays. Can't complain about that. A little money, not too stressful, and I want to work there. Or, leastwise, I did until the dude called me from the bakery today. It's the contrary thing again. I felt like I was a putz that he was just stringing along. He waited too long to phone me back, and now he's dangling just a wee tidbit of work for me.   Stupid, really, I don't even want to work any more; (for the time being, not be all home-y forever) I feel guilty for not working, but I can also recognize that I'm feeling better. I can drive a bit, I can handle crowds a bit more, and I've not wanted to slice myself, or take a heroic doseage of over-the-counter flu remedies in about a month. Kurt's done well in stifling my guilt about staying at home, and being a bum, and I think that's helped a lot. There's still the bills, though, and the feeling like everybody's on the stage, and I'm the only person sitting in the audience. But, there is the undeniable fact that the need to die is waning.   Flipped stupid sleep schedule over again, tracing back to the Night of the Floppy Rob. Arggh.  It's bound to get corrected with the oncoming early mondays, at least, I hope so, because the pain of pulling in 8-12 on little or no sleep is a painful thought, and hey, even more painful to do.  Minako has lent us the first season of "24". Never saw it before two nights ago; heard for a long time now that it's quality tv. (If that's not a contradiction in terms.) Kurt and I watched five hours of it. It's awesome. I'd take the time to think up asthetically pleasing ways to describe the show, but my eyes are getting bleary, and I seem to be reading the same sentance over and over again when I'm proofreading what I just wrote. So, bye bye for you.

      Seems like every time I say something definitive, the world becomes determined to prove me wrong. No news about the possibility of returning to school; my appointment got cancelled and moved ahead to a date undisclosed to me at this time. We did, however, talk to Student Loan. They lost the thingy that Kurt sent to them two weeks ago. You know, the crucial thingy that was supposed to be a priority - the crucial, priority thingy that enabled kurt to get his elusive student loan. From the bottom of my heart, I'd like to say, "thanks, assholes". It's humorous in the way that would be if it weren't happening to Kurt - he actually asked them if he ought to mail it, since faxes become misplaced. They assured him that no no no, they wouldn't lose such a valuble piece of documentation; they get faxes ALL the TIME, and he shouldn't worry his little head about it. And, it's a priority; they'll take care of it RIGHT away, because, well, now, most of the student loans are over and processed by now.   Yeah, the good people there are overworked, underpaid, and have their own myriad of horrible problems. Does not prevent me from wanting to mail steaming poo and black roses to their office, perhaps, some produce with a knife protruding, and a little note that says "You." Such anti-social behaviour is counter-productive, however satisfying it may be. Or so my therapist tells me.  The world of annoyance was banished for a few sweet, sweet hours whilst I hung out with Mama, and watched a movie with Kurt. Mama was hilarity in a cute outfit, the movie was "Memento" and it was just about the most disturbing thing I've seen the last little bit. I'm not even entirely sure I liked it. I can say though, that it was a damn good movie, just not so much sure if I want to see it again.  That's all she wrote.

      Crankyness continued. No food in the house, no gas in the car, and Student Loans are sitting around with various appendages sticking in assorted bodily orifices.  End of September is here, folks, and Kurt has no books, his shoes are falling apart, and it seems unbelieveably stupid that this has to continue for at least (AT LEAST) another week.  Agh.   On the positive side, it's an abject frustration that fills up my brain. Frustration is good, it means that I'm not going to sit down and weep, but i may feel the need just to say fuck it and have a nap. People are pissing me off in ways I've not experienced since high school, and that teenage attitude of "Screw off, world" is making a comeback. There's a certain vitality in this pissedoffedness, but I'm hoping it won't last; I don't have the energy to keep it up.  Oh hey, I can drive again! Well, mostly. I've not had any panic attacks whilst driving in the last month or so. I do, however have crazy cold sweat nightmares about driving, but since I'm not napping while I'm driving, it's not too much of a problem. I drove my own self to meetings with CaseWorker and Sidekick, through traffic, no less. Yeaaaaaaaaah, go me! Speaking of which, I may find out salient News tomorrow on whether or not I can complete the degree. Send prayers, mojo and happy vibes, pretty please.

      K, so found a job i want, applied, and now I'm waiting. Waiting. WAITING. Seems to be the tune in which I'm dancing to lately. This one is a literacy co-ordinator about forty minutes' commute away. Sounds like an amazing job, and it is something that I'm qualified for. Then again, that's how I felt about the last zillion or so jobs I've applied for.  The devious plan I mentioned before is now out of my hands, so I suppose now I can divulge it - I've applied, with the help of a case worker, to the Disabilities Fund; a project that is designed to help disabled people achieve career goals through funding. If I got it, I'd be able to finish my university degree, and They would also arrange for a modest sum of money as well to cover living expenses while I'm at school.  It's not particularily devious, but I feel like it is; any second now, someone will say "Ha! You're not disabled! You just suck! You lack moral fibre, and you're a very silly person! No help for you!"   It's funny how your thoughts, feelings, and occasionally body will try and kill you sometimes. Doesn't make any sense. My brain is trying to undermine me on a regular basis. Sometimes I believe I have a legitimate illness, along the same lines as diabetes; you know, constant maintainence without a cure. The rest of the time I feel like a lazy waste of space, inept at the most basic of tasks. Both points of view sort of suck.  I have to say, though, that the CaseWorker, and her Sidekick have been amazingly helpful, understanding, and nice. A rare find, most people I've come across in these sorts of 'helper' positions are anything but. I think they may even care what happens to me.

      Greetings and Salutations,  So much nothing is happening, I've been resigned to re-arranging the furniture in the living room, and vacuuming the floor repeatedly. I noticed today that I have a lot of sheets, and blankets, covering my windows and furniture. I think it has the over all effect of making everything bedroomlike, and causes people that visit nappish. Makes me nappish, anyways.  Been doing the daily online job search, and it is simply perverse what's posted. Wholesaler selling tanning products, door to door. Office cleaner. Factory worker packing chips or some such garbage. Yick. Kurt wants me to write, to forget about finding work, and I'm sorely tempted to do it, except, well, paranoia ensues. Technically, the student loan should cover all living expenses - however, reality has a tendancy to push technicalities away completely.  My life: expanses of boredom puncuated by moments of sheer terror.

      (original to follow by mail in case you need to fax it to Albert Students Finance Board)         September 9, 2003     Mr Kurt Holukoff       Dear Kurt:     This letter is to advise you that the Bursary and Loan Committee considered your application for financial assistance at its recent meeting and has agreed to award you a $2520 bursary of which $1260 will be applied towards your university account.     You will need to go to the Student Accounts Office located in University Hall after 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday to pick up a cheque for the balance of the funds ($1260 - to assist with first term book and living costs).

      Worst Case Scenario has become merely a fact, background information, another obstacle. Kurt's got an appointment today with the Bursary Lady, and he's mustered the support of the Dean, all of his profs, and profs from last year. It's looking all right.  Went out friday night, and got destroyed. It was amazing to relax, grin like an idiot, and talk to people, (also, i suspect, like an idiot) but it was slightly disturbing as to how hard the alcohol hit me - hours after I had finished drinking. Kurt tells me I turned into Robyn MacFloppy about fifty yards from the apartment, and I stayed rubbery until waking up the next day. We figured out later that I wasn't drugged, nor had I drank myself into a stupor, but, what had happened was that I did not eat all day. Also, cider's a peculiar thing; by drinking water, instead of ensuring a hangover free next day,  reactivates the alcoholic properties. So, four ciders, and a lot of water did not have the effect that was intended. Wasn't particularily hung over the next day, it was just that my body didn't work exactly the way it ought to, and I was light headed. It's safe to say that such alcoholic indulgences won't be repeated for a signifigant period of time.  Sarade can be my wife/mother/cook anytime; Sunday dinner was simply the best I had since moving out of the parental units' palatial palace. I think I've found a new love - Yorkshire puddings with an excessive amount of gravy. Thank you an exceeding amount.  Still have not heard from the bakery. I'm not going to be worried about it, my secret plan B is in effect, and moving forward, and besides, I enjoy being housewife extraordinare. Cleaning up the house, playing with the animals, and being safe in the home is cause for contentment. I'll be out doing the grind soon enough, might as well enjoy momhood without the screaming brood for the time being.  Today is Kurt's birthday, he's 27. In honor of the occasion, a date thing happens this evening. Suggestions for a Kurt worthy present are now being taken, so if any of you folks have any ideas, let me know.

      Remember that utterly asinine letter Student Loans sent Kurt? Worst-Case Scenario has offically set in. Kurt has been denied a student loan, unless he can produced written proof that someone will front 2 500 dollars. Also, there's a clock on the situation; act too late and Student Loan won't care if he has twice that amount.  The plan of attack is again appealing to the university for funds in the form of bursaries. Also, it has been recommended he go speak to the Dean of Arts, see if he can muster support, or see if the dean has any suggestions on this impending financial doom. Kurt's marks are superduper, he's got a fair shot at it. He's not worried; he's going to classes, letting his profs know his situation, and handling all of this exceedingly well.   I, unsurprisingly, am not.  I can't help but wonder what the fuck we were thinking when we came out here. True, we did not anticipate this shit unloading on us by the metric ton; but we knew it wasn't going to be Saturday morning cartoons or a day at the beach. I was delusional to a certain extent, though; I really thought that I would have, keep, and excell at a job that might help pay the bills. Maybe even go back to school. Alas, I am not provider extraordinare, in fact, I feel, with daily increases, that I'm more of a liability than anything else. I can't even drive the car during the day - I panic. Nor can I go out in public; like the grocery store during peak hours, and more recently, the movie theater has been scary. And that's newfound frosting on the stale cake of my illness. There are the old standby symptoms of overwhelming grief; ailments that can only be attributed to psychosomatics. Self-mutilation. New fucked-up symptoms happen monthly. Yeah, I'm an excellent canidate to provide for our little family.  Kurt hasn't stopped believing in me, though. I rather wish it were contagious. I could do with a nice solid dose of self-belief.   Minako and Granger - I hope you feel better soon.

      So, I called the bakery today, and the boss was in the City. I ordered a Big Mac, fries and a coke, and asked Movie Guy to let the boss know that I still wanted the job. A lot. Evidently there are more people to come in for a day's work, Movie Guy mentioned two people in the following days.   There are a few other possiblities mentioned in the Almighty job bank - a line cook at a pub, and an assistant manager of a newly-opened video rental place. I am busily trying to convince myself that I would be qualified for the rental place. I suppose I am, but I'm experiencing issues as to how to explain to someone else that I'd be good at it. Don't really feel like I'm all that stellar at anything at the moment; I just feel sick and tired, and worried. Stellar worrier, perhaps.  Kurt had his first day of classes today; unlike last year, he actually slept the night before. Last year, he was like a kid on Christmas Eve. I can really tell he's happy - he's being a jerk, and has been picking on me all day. He's been thinking about overloading, and attempting an early graduation. On the outset, seems like a good idea, save for he's unsure about what to do next, and shorting himself out on a couple of years can't come in handy when making decisions. At the same time, though, the sooner he graduates, the less student loans. It's not a decision anyone should have to make; wondering if you should speed up your education to save money. Education is supposed to be a right, right? Fucking reality, it always gets in the way of things.

      Haven't heard back from the bakery; they did say that they would let me know either way. I suspect I'll hear something tomorrow, nobody's in today.  And, for the last week or so, I've been a crank; this complete lack of meaningful employment has got my head spinning with thoughts of doom. There are few places left for me to drop my resume off, excluding fast food places. Fricken economy. It's times like this I wish I could bend over and kick my own ass for letting myself out of satelite tv hell; it sucked, I picked up lice, but it was a wage that could actually pay the bills. Of course, at this point, I'd probably be dead, wrapping the fruity purple civic around a tree or telephone pole out of sheer  frustration.   In other news, the Students are back in full force, being noisy assholes. I vacillitate between wanting to wring their mid-eighties born necks, and wanting to be a part of the fun. Is it loneliness? I'm not really sure. I know I miss school, as in the actual academic bits, and the thought that comes along with school; that the future is still open, and putty in a student's soon-to-be-educated hands. Still deciding, and moving toward What You Want To Be When You Grow Up.  Then again, it may be just that I want to smack the snooze alarm on Reality, and go back to the nice warm womb of university education, being all potential, and no actual. It winds back though my head that I really ought to be writing, but I'm still procrastinating, waiting for something, or something. It seems that I'm suffering from some sort of creative constipation that I can't work out with a pencil. I know everything is in place, or enough is in place to get bloody started. So, what's my major malfunction?  Enough of this navel gazing, I'm off to, well, navel gaze elsewhere.

      The furballs have been domesticated with a speed that seems entirely implausible. Not only do they enjoy human contact, but now they seek it out. They're still not so good at litterbox usage; they use it, but once or twice daily they end up with crap smeared all over their little kitty butts and tails. Kurt and I figure it's to do with the fact that they are long haired cats. It makes me wonder, though, how they ever learn not to poop all over themselves. They look for milk in people's appendages. They nibble and suck on toes, noses, fingers, ears, chins, and any other possible exposed fleshy bits. (Gently, though, they aren't ravening fiends.) They are entirely too cute to be in real life.  I still feel like death kept at a lukewarm temperature. It's bumming me out, but I guess it is the correct season to feel invalid-y - I don't want to go outside, it's too cold. So, I don't feel I'm missing out on the wonders of the great outdoors, I like viewing them from the window, inside, wearing flannel pyjamas.  Nothing new on the job front. I'm all right with that, the kittens are fairly full time, and I'd rather spend time with their poopy butts than serve customers in any capacity. Aaaah, the sweet balm of antisocial behaviour. Had a long talk with Minako last night, she made me feel better about being weird freaky me. I also got to hang out with That Girl on thursday, which was awesome; I had not expected to see her after the amends conversation. I feel pretty lucky.  No student loan at the end of this week. We're hoping it will come soon. We're running out of toilet paper again, and like i said before, a person can handle only so much rice. Kurt got an email from Student Accounts to make reparations right away, and the bills are knocking on our door in a polite but very persistant manner.  I need a costume for halloween. All my good ones are in the City. Suggestions are welcome.

      Once upon a time, there was a man who had a Very Bad dream. The dream was such a nightmare that he felt the need to swear that he would destroy the next thing to enter his room, on the condition that the dream would end, and trouble him no longer. The gods, or demons, heard his promise, and the man awaoke from his nightmare. He saw his only daughter before him, who had woke him from his terrible dream. But, a promise is a promise, and he tried to kill his daughter. The daughter ran from him, and a cherry tree in the garden called to her, and bore her away to an island where the cherry tree, and the daughter spent many a happy year. During this time, she learned to speak with the birds, and the animals, and in time, they brought her news of the world away from her safe island and her saviour cherry tree. Years went by. Then, a bird came to the girl (now a woman) and told her that her father was ill, and was on his death bed. The girl went to her father's side right away; and with her presence and administrations, he was soon in the very bloom of health. Upon his recovery, he slew his daughter, because, after all, a promise is a promise.   So, finally, we are blessed with 4 little furballs to take care of before they can be adopted. There are two white kittens; one with a grey smear on its head, and two different colored eyes. There are two black ones. They tend to cuddle together in lumps of two; one black, one white. They appear to be in good health, are approximately 4 weeks old, and they are wilder than your average raccoon. (A surgical toothed strike on my right pinky can attest to this.)  Apparently, the four were huddled in a barn, and with the help of sturdy gloves taken in by a volunteer in the same  in which organisation Kurt and I are a part. The lady had no room for our fierce little babies, so now they are sequestered in the spare room. We're to tame them, have them immunized, cleaned, and socialized. Then, off they go to worthy homes. They are, despite the dirt, beautiful animals, fluffy, with large, expressive eyes. Sharp teeth, though.  I did finish my application for the parent helper. I felt obligated to finish what I had begun, and I have the hope that in applying, and perhaps obtaining this employment would increase my opinon of myself somewhat. I can now say that I tried, instead of saying that I let it slide on by. Even if I don't get the job, I feel like, well, that I've done something active, instead of passively waiting for my brain to hurry up and heal. Blah. I sound hokey. You know what I mean, though, right? I feel like I'm sitting here with my thumb firmly implanted in my ass, so I've got to do a little something, even if it turns out I can't take the job. (For example, if i got my back-to-school funding.)  No news other than the Four Beasties. My stomah still feels achey, sore, and otherwise like it forcibly removing it would be a less painful option. Lucas' itchies are subsiding. Kurt is doing A-ok in school, and the family is good, the friends are likewise, and I learned today that Pascal's Wager is much more complicated than what I thought.

      Sick again.  Sick sick sicky sickeroo sick sick sickety sick. I've got a bunch of non-specific symptoms telling me buptkiss, save for misery and i are going steady, or something. Aghh. I'm so cranky about it I'd like to go out and infect the world. Come, everyone, share my cranky sickyness.   Had a job interview on Saturday. Went ok, still haven't completed my application in that I've not gotten around to emailing my resume and references. It seems inordinately tiring to do anything. Makes me figure "Hey, well, if I can't muster the energy to forward my application, i really, really shouldn't get the job, nor should I try." The position is that of a parental helper; basically, gopher and kid-chaser for a pregnant lady who can't lift anything. It's two days a week, and entails a whopping sum of 100 dollars a day. Nice family, nice kids, both parentals are doctors; a GP, and a head shrinker. (You know, I mean no disrespect when I use that term. It is simply because I can't spell the technical, nor am i inclined to be arsed about looking it up, sounding it out, or interupting my 'thought' processes to check it out. The more observant of you will notice that I can't spell. Why go for surprise?)  I applied in the first place for purely mercantile reasons, and I think my spirit is trying to make sure I don't do anything stupid. Like, take a job which i have no energy for. (And probably, ought not try for as I couldn't get funding for school, if that were the case.) Although, to be fair, since my birthday, I have been actually Doing Things, like keeping the apartment clean, walking the dog, and other assorted normal person stuff. Crashed out hard after a few days, though.   Phoned the Caseworker today to find out about funding. No news. She told me she was going to phone as soon as she found out. It's frustrating, but at the same time, I'm glad it is taking longer than shorter. It is my superstition that it takes a lot less time to say "No". I suppose I've got an all right chance to get the funding; it's typically for an entire training program at a college, and I just need one university course. I'm sort of wondering, though, that bad credit would make them say no. I don't think so, but wouldn't they look upon it as a lack of responsibilty, and decide I'd spend the alloted funds on smack or something?  The D&D supergroup is almost complete; we've got one person to jack up to eighth level. Last week it was much fun, but extremely chaotic and loud. Got extremely tired afterward. Also, despite the fact that everyone is friends in the supergroup, I felt very anxious, like i generally do in crowds. Not enough anixety to stop playing, though.  I am writing again. Not much at all, but it's there.

      My childish illusions are shattered.  There once was a girl who I dismissed,  and thought was more than a little daft, despite the fact that I recall good conversations with her. My friends told me she was an idiot, and I readily agreed. I think I knew better; but I don't suppose it matters. I had my head up my ass through most of those years.  We're now in the same place, and last night, we talked for hours. I realised that while I was going through Stuff, she was going through Stuff; and had we just communicated, I doubt she would have just been that girl, she would have been a friend.   I was a member of a clique who loved to make fun of her. We all new she was nice; that she could play a mean guitar, and that she was a great swimmer, but there was something about her that made her a target. Maybe it was the niceness, or her nervous way of talking, but we thought we smelled weakness, and went out for blood. I had nothing against her, but didn't like her by default, and I was blissfully igonorant of anything about her, she was just that girl that the girls I hung out with couldn't stand, and therefore, I could stand her either.  I met her almost ten years ago, and I am so sorry, so very sorry that I missed out on being this girl's friend. But, I had the best conversation last night that I've had in years, and I think that we might see more of each other, if we'll be able put the past where it belongs. Anyways, even if not, I got to appologize for the shittiness I dealt her, and she accepted. It's not every day that happens.  Makes everything else I did yesterday pale. (Of course, the only noteworthy thing I did yesterday was not have a nap; nonetheless had something Really Cool happend, I still think it would have been pretty anticlimatic.)  It's kind of funny. Sometimes you're in bullshit, but sometimes, just sometimes, you're the one causing it. I'm really glad TheGirlIMissed is giving me an oppurtunity to clean it up.

      Thanks for sending cards yesterday, everyone.  Thanksgiving dinner at the house of the Giraffe monday was awesome; I ate pumpkin pie for the first time, I possibly have a date to see the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and the evening was stupidly enjoyable, as well as certainly fattening. Tuesday was teryaki at Minako's, along with some season two 24. I still hate Kim. Yesterday the day was spent happily in bed, playing video games, talking, and sporadic napping. Ventured the great outdoors to buy cereal, and that was the extent of it - a good day.  We have a date - sort of - to expect Kurt's student loan. The Powers that Be have given us assurances that it will be in before the end of next week. As much as i love mini wheats, rice, and water; i will be very, very happy to purchase new food items. Superstore, watch out! It certainly appears that Murphy has punished us with the full extent of the law when it comes to finances.  There's been a lot of indirect madness happening because of the screw up; Kurt's fighting hard not to lose all focus when it comes to school, purchasing of medications had to be postponed, and generic stress has settled in like a big funky blanket. Both of us have really noticed that Things In General have a way of inccuring crappiness in rapid succesion; so for the time being, it is although we're shell shocked, and waiting for the next Event to happen, all the while knowing that there will be an Event immediately following the solution to the current Event. No rest for the weary, I guess.   Lucas' itchies have subsided, now we wait for the fur to grow back. You know, until he decides he's unbearably itchy again. Kurt is mostly convinced he gets itchy for the attention. I think he may be wrong, but what really goes through the mind of that most devious dog?  After watching Moulin Rouge again i want to dress up as a can-can dancer for Halloween. I think I may have trouble finding an adequate costume, though. Aah, Halloween, my favorite holiday.

      Sarade and Minako are roommates no longer; it is interesting to note that there has been no direct communication between these two ladies, despite four attempts made by Minako, and that they are in most classes together. One could almost conjecture that there would be no evidence supporting Sarade's Exodus; however, the lack of bed would imply otherwise. Interesting scenario, that. The issue went rather rapidly from Minako not wishing to share a space with Sarade's boyfriend, to Sarade's questioning of Minako's sanity. Evidently, it is not a far jump from space issues to slander.   Saw "Kill Bill" on Saturday night; if you're a Quentin Tarantino fan, and/or you love kung fu, over the top action, and cheese, this movie is it. I loved it. It did nothing new with content, characters, or dialogue, and the blood was very spurty; but I loved it. I got the sense that the film was not just made, but crafted. It was funny, it had adrenaline, and the dialogue ran in places like poorly translated Japanese. Aaah, yes. And it had the essential motif of Pretty Girls Kicking Ass. Great movie.  Sunday sucked. Woke up, and was treated to a stomach ache extraordinaire. Missed thanksgiving dinner Chez Minako's, and went back to sleep. When I woke up the second time, I listened to messages sent from Kurt from Minako's, and then curled up into a little sad ball and cried my little sad face off. I could hear people in the background on the message, and I thought about walking into the apartment, already crowded with people, and I couldn't do it. They had saved me food from dinner, and I thought, upon awakening, that I could at least assist with the cleanup. Dragged my sad little body into the shower, and cleaned it off, sat back on the bed upon drying, and cried some more. There were only three people I didn't know there, but somehow it became too much, and my brain reeled off all sorts of excuses; for example, I had asked Kurt to come back and get me - he didn't because of a miscommunication, and I took it as evidence that I wasn't really wanted there, anyways. Stupid, stupid. Minako sent Kurt back with a plate of food, and well wishes, and I felt depressed, hideously depressed, and I went back to sleep. Woke up again, and watched "28 Days" with Kurt, and our neighbours; Giraffe, and The Angry Man. Tomorrow, we're to go to the Giraffe's ancestral home, and eat; which is positively super in theory. In practice; I'm scared I'll wake up on the wrong side of my brain a little later, and decide I have to spend the entire day in seclusion.   So why the trauma? Beats the shit out of me. Going to have to attribute it to "Another One of Those Days." And I have to say, from my heart, that it sucks, and that reasoning is not satisfying. I also forgot to get a referral from the doctor to see a lady psychiatrist. I hope I can call to get one.   We've got word that Christmas in the City is a concrete possibilty. The estimated time of said stay would be a month. Looks like the appropriate thing would be to spend half or more of the holidays with Kurt's parents; the furnishers of said trip. I don't feel entirely comfortable with that. Kurt believes that I don't like his parents, and, when i first met them, all my defenses were up, and I didn't. A lot has changed since then, though, they don't seem quite so alien to me, and well, hey, I love them. But, I'm still terribly uncomfortable around them, I feel like we have very little common ground to stand on, and the thing I'm worried about most is that they're going to come face and eyes up against my illness, and well, I don't want that. It's embarassing. My own parents treated me like glass for years, how am I to expect any degree of normal behaviour from folks who really don't know me all that well? Yes, yes, I really ought to have more faith in people. Bottom line is, though, that I'm worried there will be another intercession for Kurt's well-being, and they'll politely suggest that he should run; not walk, away from me as fast as his skinny legs will carry him.   Hmm. For an awfully long time, I was of the mind that almost nothing embarassed me. I can see rather clearly right now that this is not the case. Being depressed embarasses me. I try to be open about it; I try not to hide it, or make issue of it; just like it's another fact of life, like I have brown hair, and my name is spelled with a 'y'. But, no one asks me why my hair is brown. They do ask why I'm sad. It seems like I never have a good reason; I'm just this person who spends a large portion of her life hysterical. I refer to being depressed as having bad chemicals, so that way there is a demarcation between being grieved or having my brain mess with me. When it's bad chemicals; there isn't any reason. That lack of reason is possibly the most frustrating aspect of my illness; it feels like I forever have to justify feeling sad, or that I can't legitimately feel sad, it's all a swamp of confused brain chemicals.  I've lost friends, because being depressed was too much for them to handle, or it wasn't real to them, or it was just too messy to get involved in. So, I'm embarassed, because every time I break, it seems people lose respect for me. Or they become uncomfortable, and  then I become uncomfortable, and it just gets stupid. I don't suppose it's anyone's fault. It does make me want to run and hide, though.

      Doctor said I really ought to be sleeping more, attributes all my symptoms to a lack of it, and gave me sleeping pills. Took one last night around twelve thirty, and I slept. And had nightmares all night long. I don't think the two are related; but possibly maybe the nightmares are why I never can sleep. It could be a conditioned response telling my subconsious to just back the fuck up and read all night. It is 8.03 in the pm, and I'm still feeling exhausted; but i suspect that after that full night of sleep, my body is longing for that elusive coma state.  We did get a call confirming that the fax has been recieved. Deep sigh of relief, and off to the land of waiting we go. I have no idea when we'll actually get Kurt's papers, but at least the wheels are turning. There is also less pressure, for Kurt got an email from Pam The Money Lady again:   October 7, 2003   Mr Kurt Sheldon Holukoff  Dear Kurt:     This letter is to advise you that the Bursary and Loan Committee reviewed your application for financial assistance again at its recent meeting and has agreed to provide you with a voucher for the Campus Store which will allow you to charge your first term books to your university account.    You will need to go to the Student Accounts Office located in University Hall to pick up the voucher.  I regret to advise you that we are unable to provide you with any further assistance for the fall semester of this academic year through this program.     cc Student Accounts Office   Pam   Financial Aid  University   So, no trouble for misappropriating funds, but we've been cut off from the financal teat of the university. We're ok with that. I was starting to run arrest scenarios in my head. I don't precisely see where Pam was coming from with her pissed offedness with Kurt; were we really expected to let the car go into arrears? Why didn't they do the voucher thing with the books right off, knowing that from rent alone, we'd eat up 1000 dollars? Were we that unreasonable? (I suppose not, considering they did give Kurt the voucher for his books.) Is it just me, though, or was that letter a bit on the bitter side?  Thank God for parents; otherwise I don't expect we would have eaten the last little bit. No worries for me, I've got a veritable camel hump, but Kurt has long ago lost his blub, and he's already self concious about his skinny legs.

      Between 4.05 and about 4.40, I woke up eight times. EIGHT. What is going on, Mr Sandman, what? Did I forget to pay my bill? It's weird that I kept falling back asleep, and then waking up in such incredibly short intervals. Stupid body, I'll get the last laugh...  A friend of mine recently went to Alabama to deflower a largish, not-so-attractive virgin, who lives in a trailer. Sounds like a joke or something. They met on the internet. He is taken aback by her honesty and generosity. So, he's at a loss, whether or not to maintain a Jerry-worthy long distance romance with the duckling, or let this one drift off into cyberspace. Classic case, I'm supposing, of appearences versus personality. Tough call. I mean, it's all wonderful to be non-superfical and say looks don't matter; but sometimes, I wonder if any of us are capable of ignoring a lack of chemistry in a relationship. Oh, and, apparently, her family is going to get a large hunk of coin for settling out of court on a medical malpractice case. I take the joke thing back, it sounds like the beginning of a sitcom. Good people, says my friend, the Deflowerer. And you thought your life was interesting.   Kurt had to re-fax that vital bit of info again, because, well, it got lost again. Considering the situation, The Powers That Be allowed him to fax the info to an actual person's office this time. Said person is supposed to phone us tomorrow with when we can expect it. I'm not going to hold my breath. Kurt also had a meeting with Pam yesterday, concerning the fact that Kurt hasn't got books yet. The plan was to politely ask to be able to put the books on account, and she upbraided him for using the bursary money to pay the car payment rather than buy his books. Kept on repeating "You had no right,". I'm concerned that we somehow got Kurt into trouble for misappropriation of funds, or something. At least we didn't spend it on smack.  It must be the time of year; two groups of friends are having moderate to severe roomate woes. In both cases, it comes down to space, and comfort levels.  I'm extremely thankful I never had such issues with my roomates; most of the time it was butting heads over what to cook for supper, what music to listen to, or whose turn it was to do the dishes. (I remember once my parents came to visit. They did the dishes. It was awesome.) Mojo to the warring factions; here's to peaceful co-existance, re-unification and mature ways of dealing with another's needs.

      Eventually, Kurt and the friendly neighbourhood Giraffe phoned the Mounteds to clear out The Most Popular Boys in the World's party. As far as I can tell it broke up pretty painlessly, no arrests, smashing, or anything untoward. Good on them.  Going to the doctor on Tuesday. Time to put together my list of symptoms, and questions. I dislike going to the doctor so much that I usually make for damn sure I've got at least three things wrong with me. So, let's see.  1) I pee at least four times a night. 2) No energy. 3) Trouble sleeping, and trouble staying asleep. 4)Every time I eat, my stomach hurts for hours. 5)Frequent headaches. 6) Frequent muscle spasms and back pain. 7)Percription renewal and checkup.  Seven lucky reasons. It reads like my body is falling apart, but I think most of my ailments, if not all are connected with being depressed. Everything sleep related certainly is, and I've noticed over the years that those random aches and pains are too. Helps to get checked out just in case, though. Wouldn't want to be running around with another disease, would I?   Finished watching the first season of 24. As minako puts it; it is the first show in a long time to come out where one is not one step ahead. There are hints, and things unravel very neatly, but I couldn't just sit there and figure out precisely what happens. It's also a show that is so watchable you can spend eight hours of your life immersed in it, and have no concept of the time that's past. Visual heroin. Poor Jack Bauer, though. The first 24 hours we get to know him, he goes through hell. Then, evidently, he goes through hell at least two other times in his life. I would think once was plausible, twice not so much, and three times ridiculous - but hey, I'm more than happy to let the show prove me wrong.   I'm home sick, and lonely for my parental units. It is a pity that home is a 6 hr car drive with no place to stay at the end of said trip; and parental units live six hours away by plane, and live in a completely landlocked city.

      Boom badaaaaaaaaa boom smack smack smack smack, booooooooooom badaaaaaaaaa booooooom, smack smack smack, whooooooooooooooo!  Downstairs, my neighbours (referred to as The Most Popular Boys In the World,) are having a party with 50 or so of their closest friends. It's slightly irritating, what with the rattling of the dishes and so on, but I'm not overly upset about it; no one's getting beat up, smashing things, or screaming obscenities; they're merely dancing their tails off, and cheering. And, well, stomping, evidently. And singing. Yeah, despite the irritation, it sounds like they're genuinely having a good time.   Mostly noneventful week, parental units kept us in groceries, and we even managed some treats. On Monday, Kurt calls the Powers That Be to find out how many seconds before the final trump the loan will come in. Maybe we'll be lucky, and they'll lose it again. No, wait. You know what'd be LUCKY? If they forgot entirely about Kurt when it comes to paying them. When that happens, don't worry about the pain in your rectum; it's just the monkeys getting ready to take off.   My poor Lucas has still got the itchies. He's pulling fur off his bum and other Very Itchy Places. I keep checking him for fleas, but to no avail. Either they're not there, or they are ninja fleas. Another reason to hope for the speedy delivery of the Loan; he's got to see a vet so we can all rest easier. Baby lotion with aloe seems to allievate some of the itch...I bet you'd like me to stop talking about my dog's ass now, eh? All right. We'll talk about MY ass.

      I slept, and my God, it was good.   Of course, it was for almost 16 hours, but i never did like to quibble over details. It was the first time in easily recalled memory that I woke up without that hit-by-a-truck feeling, and as an added bonus, from the hours of 3.30am to 11am, I didn't even kick. At 11am, i got up, felt unsick, unheadached, and unpainful. However, I was feeling exhausted anyways, and so, back to sleep I went. I've been in and out of consciousness all day. Beats the hell out of sleeping for three hours every couple of days as was my wont for about a week and a half.  My mother saved our asses with money to placate the power and phone companies. We aren't going to get disconnected. We now have no immediate bills, the next big one being the 15th Dec. Ok, so that's not all that far from now, but far enough that Kurt's getting his work done, and we're both sleeping. It isn't a huge reprieve, but it'll do.   Lucas got a dog sweater.The plane is going to be cold, and although I know he has fur, and all that jazz, I'm still preoccupied with the vision of him shivering in his carrier, pissed off at me for abandoning him, and plotting his revenge. The sweater is red, with blue and white stripes, and he loves it. If i pick it up, he waggles expectantly, and assumes the position for sweater placement. When he wears it, he prances, approaching everybody with his "I am sooooooo pretty" expression. The sweater doesn't exactly fit him, however. Lucas is a funny shaped dog, being all chest and neck, with his head being slightly too small, and his back legs just a shade taller than his front legs. The result is that his chest is too broad for the sweater to be a turtleneck; as it was on the picture. But, it covers his bare belly, it does keep him warm, and he looks damn pretty. Plus, he'll be wearing my bandanna around his neck, to keep that bit of him warm. One came with the sweater, but he doesn't like it; it's too small to be worn around his neck, and he refuses anything on his head.   That's it for now. I've been up for three solid hours, and I'm sleepy again.

      I am a doofus.  Even more doofy than usual. Went to this farm place to make contact with someone about learning how to knit, and helping out down there in exchange for learning things, and I was so friendly, so enthusiastic, that I pretty much drooled all over the chick I spoke to. "Spoke" might be too strong a word, I think i mostly gibbered at her. I think most of the time I'm pretty unflappable about things. Well, maybe mostly upset about things. Anyways, enthusiasm is about as easy for me as jumping out of a tree and flying, so actually being excited about something is novel, and, well, sort of embarassing. I had to keep a really tight rein on my mouth to refrain from asking her if she liked me, and wanted to be my friend.   Phoebe is liking her carrier. It's still very, very ugly.  Waiting to her from the Traveller to find out if I get some quality time with her. No word.   Two days to pay the power bill, and no coin to do it. Send mojo kids, we're waiting for a prescription refund, and that'll cover it perfectly, but it is entirely possible that that won't come in until after we return from the City. Looks like the phone is going out too. Can't remember when right off hand, but soon. We'll be able to get things reset when Student Loan, Part Deux comes in.

      Finished reading "Hotel New Hampshire" again. First time I read it, I told the owner of the book that I didn't read fiction, because, well, who wanted to read stuff that happens in real life? I was fifteen, and a voracious reader. I read fantasy and sci-fi, because that's what my dad read, and Dad taught me to read. First book I ever read was "The Hobbit", followed by the "Lord of the Rings", followed by "The Narnia Chronicles". Definitely set the beat that I've been dancing to ever since. It was on the beach, and I was fifteen, and this unearthly handsome lifeguard who was much older than me and seemingly infinitely wiser showed me that fiction was not only interesting, but vivid.  I still prefer fantasy, though. Fairy tales, happy endings, heroics. I think it's partially because of the way I see the novels I read; I picture them in cartoon. Fiction becomes like moving oil paintings, and the effect can be beautiful; but where it's at for me is always going to be where there's magic; sparkles, and glowing things and the unearthly nonglow of ring wraiths and other fell things.   But, Mike, where ever you're at now, thank you sincerely for "Hotel" and fiction.  The beginnings of Something Slightly Ambitious are brewing. I got all funk with out the George Clinton goodness the other day when I came the realization that I am, in fact, a lazy ass. Kept on thinking about it, and, upon further discovery, saw that I may not be lazy after all; I just need to be able to work from home. Or in other people's homes, away from people, the public, and supervisory types. I've not gotten into what that means; I�m content with identifying what my problem is.  So, I am going to work from home. This is most likely going to be a slow process, as I will be learning everything along the way. And since my superstitions about revealing plans seem to be correct, I'm not going to get into details. (For evidence on this particular superstition, recall the disabilities fund. I still haven't heard anything from those people. But, if I had have kept my mouth shut...)  Got Phoebe a carrier; it was the last one in the pet store, and it is ugly assed. We're talking flowers, and a lot of burgundy. Hideous. But it'll do the job, and is accepted all over the frigging place as far as airlines are concerned. She doesn't like it very much. Kurt thinks we ought to throw a blanket over it, because she really seems to dig tent-like places. We only got it yesterday, though, I'm sure she'll realize it's a fun place to be.  The press of bills are making it much harder for us to rest easy. I keep on kicking myself with that lack-of-job thing, but Kurt reminded me of something today: The University gave Kurt the money to cover the shortfall because I wasn't working; they were even considering not helping when they found out I was looking for gainful employment. Without that, there would be no loan at all this year. Also, Alberta gave us the maximum amount of funds based on that same rationale. In order for us to break even I'd have to have a job that racks in about 20$ an hour/ 40 hrs a week. Not only do I lack the ability to do that, finding a job like that is pretty much impossible here. Unless, of course, one is skilled.   What I can figure out is why there isn't help for me out there. Can't get welfare, Kurt's a student. Can't get disability, I haven't worked enough. So, sliding through the cracks is where we're at. Could be worse fates, I know, but having an eviction notice (although it didn't mean anything), having the phone cut off, and the power threatening to go too, all in the space of four months is enough to keep me nice and safely crazy. I have to call the province, and find out if they're hiding help from me, and harass Case Worker and Side Kick. It's intensely tiring. Did you know that to keep one prisoner in jail for 30 days costs 10 000 dollars? Maybe Jacen was on to something.   Wise man says much And to him, I have to say "Fuck, buddy, whatever."  Some time in the future, I'd like to move on to limericks, but I can't seem to get past the opening line. I'm aware that they can start any way the lyricist wishes, but I'm forever stuck on "There once was a man".

      Went to see Thespian's play, "Enemy of the People". Definitely good shit, wrought with superb performances. It seemed to take a lot of energy to perform, too; a lot of emoting, and a certain amount of pontificating. For two frigging hours. Most impressive. Despite being set in Europe, though, it seemed somehow American. It was as though there were ghostly American flags wafting in the background, nothing really concrete, but just vaguely American. Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about either.   I don't want a job. I want to want a job, though. Feeling sort of useless again. It would be entirely daft to get a job now, since we'll be off to the City for Christmas. Maybe I just want to take care of more cats. Animal therapy. I'm starting to think that perhaps i missed my calling; i think I'd make a good vet, although, i'm certain I'd be sad a lot of the time. Maybe a vet's assistant; but I'm not entirely sure there would be much of a job market. Maybe I should just talk to WAAG about how to get more involved.  My mom was telling me the other day that a dog in the City got poisoned by anti-freeze by some sick fucker; people are so entirely strange. When i was living there, someone kidnapped  three dogs, and took them to a huge park, where they were ripped up by coyotes. I think only one lived. What has to be going through your head to do something like that? Why would you poison a dog? And why is it easier for me to accept atrocities done to people than it is to animals? Soft heart, or soft head: you be the judge.

      Dumbo is a great movie. Not much talking, lots of fun stuff, and my favorite, The Pink Elephant Hallucination. But I have to say, there seems to be nothing as sad as sad elephant. Maybe it's wiping away tears with your trunk. There's a whole series of statues in the City that have crying elephants in various poses, and I can't walk by them without getting all snuffly.   Vicariously reading Blaise Pascal through Kurt; highly recommendable for anyone with a philosophic or theist bent. I won't get into it, but in this gem there's an excellent, truly excellent arguement against atheism. Typically, I've found the arguements supporting theism to leave me greatly unsatisfied. In them, it seems that it comes down to faith, a concept which has a wonderous amount of weight and value when discussing matters of a spiritual nature, but about as useful as forehead nipples when as a philosophical concept. Anyways, Pensees, by Blaise Pascal. Read it.   Nothing has been going on here, so thus endeth the blog of today.

      That flu was terrible. Made me imagine what amoebic dysenntry might be like. Kurt colorfully told the doctor "It sounds like she's pouring buckets of water into the toilet!" *sigh*  But it's over and done with, i hope.  Went to finally get my licence changed over. Turns out our marriage certificate is invalid because the lady that performed the ceremony forgot to write down Kurt's last name. I find it very peculiar that nothing, and I mean NOTHING in the last signifigant chunk of time has worked out as it should. I mean, the world is an imperfect place. I accept that. But to be completely backassward? Give me a break, seriously. Waiting for the other shoe to drop ought not to be considered a vocation. And besides, it's never the Big Bad that drives you over the ledge, it's always going to be some stupid thing that eventually wears down a sane person's resolve, and makes them want to bash in their fellows' brains in.  Or hey, maybe it's me.   It's entirely possible I overestimated how much customer service we were going to get at Wal-mart. I think that Wal-mart has the staff it does to in order to prevent shoplifting, rather than any form of customer service. I'm the first to admit that I'd rather be shoveling monkey crap that being the wonk who has to do the serving, but hot damn. We spent an hour of wandering aimlessly around the store, in hopes that some noble blue vest would answer whether or not Wal-mart carried soft cat carriers that are ok to use on a plane. Lots of people, no answers. Alas. Also, if the cat's my carry on, would it necessarily matter if it were airline approved? Could I, in fact, shove her in a book bag, provided I did not give a pair of fetid dingoes' kidneys about her comfort?  These are the questions.  I borrowed Minako's copy of "Dumbo", and I've got 'pink elephants' stuck in my head. Clippity-cloppity!

      This weekend's highlight was entirely the Guiness pub night. Nothing exciting, just good times. Woke up the next day with a particularily virulent stomach flu, one I've not had the constitution to throw off yet. Been spending a lot of my time in a semi-feverish state. If i could remember my dreams, I bet I'd have a plethora of images for slightly disturbing poetry.  Nothing overly exciting has been exposing itself in our lives at present, Kurt is struggling through the malaise that is second year, we're still scratching our heads, wondering how we're going to pay December's bills, and I'm probably not going to get any more kitties till after christmas. I almost don't want to do WAAG anymore, because of Sartre, but then i think of all the kittens running around freezing to death, and i figure i can handle the heartache if some of theses animals are saved, and going to homes where people will love them and make them pleasantly plump.   The vacation in the City looms like a largish nicotine cloud. I miss everyone, and yet the utter ass pain that such a trip entails makes me want to vomit. It could be worse, it could be overlaid with the frustration another Christmas in CB would entail, but i've just gotta say; a body at rest tends to stay at rest, and it likes it there. I'll be one of the first people to sign up for the star trek transporter, that's for sure. Two things to take care of before we're off: a soft carrier for phoebe to be my carry-on, and getting my driver's licence changed over to the Holukoff family name.   Bloodwork came back negative. I can safely say that i do not have diabetes, anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcers, and a couple other things I can't remember. One more test to come back. It's the one I'm worried about, but the peliminaries suggest a negatory. So good, yeah, very good. Except, if stuff is happening to me, and there's nothing evidently wrong, am I a hypochondriac? What's worse, having a disease, or having the symptoms with no diagnosis? Both suck. I march back into the doctor's on the fifth of december, and maybe some answers will turn up.   Gatorade tastes like dishwater.

      Remember on Sesame Street when they had the "This is your life" segment with Guy Smiley? I bet you do. In case you don't, let me refresh your memory; basically, the host would bring out a person, (muppet) and they would listen to voices from their past. Based on the voice, or voices, the contestant would guess who was speaking. So, bread remembers its sordid past with peanut butter and jam, or some such. There's a point here, be patient.  Basically, people from my past keep on jumping up and biting my ass. Poor choice of words, as the meetings are welcome, just unexpected, like a bite on the ass is bound to be. First there was the return of SD, my dear ex-roomie and partner in crime. Then comes ThatGirl, opening up the past and showing me rather clearly that I'm quite the git on occasion. And, even more importantly, allowing me to try and atone for past idiotic grieveances. Now, there's the return of a guy who i knew, liked, dated, broke up with, had a shaky friendhip with. Extremely cool fellow, came along at a point in my life when relationships were completely repellant. Tried to hang on to him as a friend, but i think i freaked him out, what with being a headcase and all. Kurt and i were driving back from bloodletting, and this guy walks in front of our fruity civic, and i make eyewitness testimony that this was this thespian guy i had dated for 10 whole, entire days. Thought i had saw him earlier in the semester, and made Kurt follow him for two blocks, trying to make a positive ID.   God, I sound insane. Completely insane.   Anyways, I being the internet savvy cat that I am, found him on icq, and messaged him. Told him I wanted to catch up, being since last intel I had on him was that he was a dance instructor somewhere peculiar, about three years ago. Luckily for me and my self esteem, he messaged back, and we're going to catch up. Now I don't have to follow him everywhere, and leave threatening messages on his porch. (And you're thinking, "Is she kidding?" You just never know...)  So I feel like I'm on Sesame Street, and I'm in "This Is Your Life." I figure all I need are some muppets to make the motif complete.  In other news, Minako has taken her leave of us, Wolfvegas, and her demented department. She's doing her practicum teaching theater, living out of her parent's place, and I say "Good." I already miss her, but she was seriously suffering at the hands of Evil Valley Syndrome, where everything about here starts to suck, and stays sucking until you get your fool hide out for an extended period of time. Sure she's going to be getting up early to teach whiny brats who don't want to be in school, but compared to the rigors she was hitting up here, she's on vacation.   I found out that the other poopsmiths are thriving. In fact, I can't call them poopsmiths anymore, they've kicked the poopies, much to the relief of their new fosters. Still will be a long wait to see if they develop FIP, but so far, so good. Thank God.  The traveller is moving a mere three hours away from here, so hopefully no more of that seeing her once a year bullshit. I'm going to try and go up to see her when she first relocates to help her feel more at home and settled in, and to make up for the time I won't be seeing her during Christmas. Quality time.  Anyone else see those "Foundation for a Better Life" commericals? Really good sentiments, but they invariably cause a chill of terror. Anyone else get this reaction?

      It's cold, I feel like I'm going to throw up, and I didn't sleep last night. I'm thinking that those sleeping pills have become a habit. It seems like it's getting harder to sleep without them. Or, you know, it isn't, and i'm just being a whiny asshole. Anyways, it feels like it's getting harder to sleep without them.   I got my bloodwork done, they took six vials of blood. SIX. God, I hate blood, needles, pointy things, and anything involving discomfort. I typically have my head turned when the blood comes out, but this time I happened to turn back just in time to see it penetrate. I flinched. (Well, I thought I flinched but Kurt assured me it was a full-body jolt). I pulled my arm back rather abruptly, realised what I was doing, and then shoved my arm forward to compensate. I couldn't bend my arm all that well for the rest of the day. Got a pretty neat bruise, too, and at the center there's that little puncture. I think next time I'll ask them to tie me down, and sedate me. With gas.  Went to Minako's last night and watched 24. It's been three episodes, and Kim hasn't done anything to make me want to kill her. After 24, Minako, Giraffe, Kurt, and SD watched videos on Much. It was definitely reminicint of high school. I think the bunch of us would make excellent commentators on crappy videos. We could get our own show, and have SD do the theme music.  Ok, enough crappy blogging. I'm going to try for a few more hours of sleep. Like, you know, eight.

      Got the rest of the loan on Thursday. After we pay all our bills owing, and coming in next month, we will have a grand total of 69 dollars left to buy groceries, a pet carrier, glasses, medication, christmas presents for family and friends, and other items. However, it's rather a moot point, since the aforementioned 69 has gone the way of the dodo.   The other poopsmiths have gone to a home without other cats. I've been assured that they will absolutely not be euthanised, unless the illnesses manifest, and they suffer for it. Otherwise, no fear of them being SPCA'd. I am thankful, although a little lonely. More than a little lonely. A lot lonely.  Went to the doctor yesterday, got prozac doubled, and happily, as of yet, no paranoia, and the negativity that depression so affords has been stifled. I go in for a bevy of bloodwork ASAP. (Branflakes, it turns out I do not have Google disease.)  Still no word on funding. Decided to take a slightly different route, and check on declaring myself disabled,  but it turns out I wouldn't get any financial help with that because I would have had to be working four out of the last six years. Don't know what else can be done. Didn't get the parent helper job, but they said they would keep my resume if they needed backup, or if this applicant doesn't work out.  I'm still scanning the want ads, but there's a lot of nothing to be had, unless I miraculously develop mad carpentering skills.

      Do you want good news or bad news first?  Good news: We have groceries, 200 dollars worth, as part of Kurt's student loan came in. The remainder is due friday, when we will pay our bills. We owe the landlord 1500 in rent, and he's already given us an eviction notice, but, according to him, it doesn't mean anything. Don't ask me, I have no idea. Anyways, it's getting worked out. The insurance on the car has been paid, we have the end of the month to pay off our power bill and phone bill, and the bank has been great about that whole student loan fubar. I get glasses soon. We're eating well. We went to Swiss Chalet yesterday, and it was simply awesome. Kurt and I ate like pigs.  But, Sartre "Smudge" Poopsmith died yesterday. She saw the vet again the night before last, as she was listless, and not all that interested in eating. Kurt and I got home from paying off the insurance people yesterday afternoon, and the little one was struggling to breathe. We got her down to the vet, only to be told there was nothing to be done. Sartre had feline distemper, as well as FIP, which is essentially the feline version of SARS. The vet euthanised her. It is quite possible we will lose the other three poopsmiths, and there is a possibility that our own cat, Phoebe will contract the infection as well. There isn't a cure, and there isn't even a reliable test to find out if the kittens, or any kittens for that matter has FIP.   There is no winning. I'm glad we took the poopsmiths in. But now it's ship them out of here, or keep phoebe far away, and wait to see if they die. The lady that is our contact in the animal group we're involved in wants to take the kittens to another house without any other cats, and hope for the best. I want them here, of course, but, I don't want to watch them die, kurt doesn't want that either, and we don't want to lose our big fat panda cat.   It's extremely difficult not to become embittered and disillusioned. I know we're working as volunteers, and that's the extent of the funding. I know some of them are sick, and lots of people in WAAG have lost entire litters despite their best efforts of keeping them healthy. We are trying to do the right thing, and give these kittens a chance, rather than enthanising them. SPCA does that. If a creature does not get adopted within a certain amount of time, or if they have certain illnesses, or if they're feral, SPCA's policy is to euthanise. That's a big reason why I don't support SPCA. There are better ways. WAAG is one of them.  Reality is much too harsh. She was so little, so thin, and very beautiful, despite her poopy, shaved ass. She was happy to spend the entire day on my shoulder. I was happy with that too, and I'm sorry she didn't get the home she deserved. I hope we made her happy for the little time she was here.

      It was a fairly sucky halloween. It was sucky in that I did not have a costume, nor did i venture out and view adult types with costumes on. I could have ventured out, costumeless, but I lacked the necessary drive to do so. We had no pumpkin, and treated were given to us by our friendly neighbourhood minako. The angry man, Stash, kurt, myself, and minako watched The Hunted, and part of a fairly tedious kung fu movie. Angry man, stash and kurt made it through the entire two hundred minutes of kung fu madness. People popped in and out of the angry man's apartment - it was nice to be marginally social, but all in all, i give this halloween a rating of C-.   The kittens, referred to as The Poopsmiths 1 Through 4, are doing marginally better in their fecal endeavors. One made a trip to the vet, as her running poopyness was more regular than the intermittant squits of her sisters. The vet shaved off her bum fur, and she's been pretty bashful lately as a result. But, no longer does she trail a festering glob of her own waste lodged in those particular hairs, which is lucky for all of us. The vet's diagnosis was that the kitten(s) were experiencing such distress due to the fact that that they are malnourished, and have nothing  left to fight off anything bad in their systems. This is particularily evident of the poopsmith the doctor examined. She is the smallest, and not only can one feel her bones, but count them with accuracy. They are all about the size of 4-5 week old kittens, but the vet assured us their actual age was closer to nine weeks. They haven't had enough food to grow. However, that's what we're here for.   I've been off prozac since the 25th. Not particularily intentional this time; we ran out of funds, and i decided now would be as good a time as any to figure out where i was at brain wise without the benefit of pharmacuticals. The paranoia i can now safely attribute to the prozac. Not a bit of the jitters, no feeling of someone sneaking up on me, and no false starts at standard noises. I can even handle the squeal of tires of moronic motorists without losing my marbles. However, my sleep schedule is even more erratic, i have a monstrous amount of overwhelming grief, even more fatigue, and the thought of crossing the street with the moronic motorists and their squealing tires has more than a passing appeal. My thoughts keep curling back to where I have secreted a piece of glass for mutilation purposes. I make frequent checks of how many pills are about the apartment, and what type. I don't think I'm in any immediate danger to myself, been on this train of thought enough times to know when to brace for the turns.  I'm throughly, wholeheartedly sick of this shit. At this point it really seems the only choice I have left is the orge's, so, in effect, no choice at all. Paranoia, general brain fuckwittage, or overwhelming grief and general brain fuckwittage. It has occured to me that i readily agree to doctor's tests and probings because i want there to be something else wrong with me, something more social acceptable, quantifiable, and hopefully treatable. Maybe I just want some fucking variety. I guess when it comes right down to it, i have some serious acceptance problems when it comes to this illness. If i had cancer, i wouldn't have people perpetually asking me what was wrong. If i had diabetes, no one would tell me to snap out of it. If i had, well, hell, just about anything else besides a mental illness, folks wouldn't say that I wasn't exactly 'lazy', just unmotivated. It's completely idiotic. There are parts of my consciousness that almost want that nice illness that everyone knows about. The other parts yell at these parts to stop being so bloody crazy. Those opposing bits duke it out, and I lapse into unconsciousness. My brain is trying to eat me.

      Feels like I've slept in thirty minute coughs; but the dreams were beautiful and vivid. I was where I grew up, wearing veils, and dancing. The road was empty, and although my dream self knew that it was the end of janurary the air was hot, and the leaves were on the trees, and I was heading to the beach.   There were other dreams, too, more indistinct - an old friend in trouble. I remember thinking in the dream how handsome, and how sad his face was; and how he wasn't as tall as I remembered. He told me I grew. (Yes indeedy, i broke that 5'2 mark...) There were whales in the ocean nearby. Depending on where I looked, it was night, then morning. I wasn't wearing shoes, and my feet were as brown as I remember them, not the perpetually surprising pale they've been now for years.  Tonight is the night, a wise man once said, where we celebrate the passing of one year into another by getting hopelessly obliterated, kissing fellow obliterates, and being Really Sick to herald the first morning of that brand new start. I think I'll go to bed early. And then, sleep in late.  I;ve been waffling greatly between wanting to be back in w/v, to dreading the bills, and wanting to hide out here in the parental's basement until the bill collectors give up on finding me. It can't be that bad as i think it's going to be, can it?  Well, that's all I got for now.

      Got up this morning 11.30am mountain time. Puttered a bit, flipped through the channels, read a bit, fell asleep. Woke up 6.30pm mountain time. I can safely say I'm not tired in the slightest.   Went to the airport last night to get some choice lost-and-found items. There is an entire wheel barrow stuffed to the brim with pointy objects like corkscrews, nail scissors, nail files, and detrius left from harried travellers. Our loot: A swiss army card, paintball gun set, a camera, swiss army knives, sewing kit, knitting needles, and Kurt's favorite, a Fish Bonker. Oh yeah, also picked up a PDA that may or may not work. Figure it's worth the effort to buy batteries.  ok, now I'm sleepy. Mono, anyone?

      This Christmas beat the shat right out of last Christmas.   Not that it's prefect or anything, but man, oh man, last Christmas sucked hard. Ghost poop everywhere; recovering from a drug addiction, defintitely not good times. This Christmas we've been fed, there's been virtually no poop compared to last year, and, well, yeah. I want to go back to our apartment now, though. I'm tired. I wouldn't be any less tired anywhere else, but I'm 'vegas-sick. Kurt and I have got our own space there, such as it is, until we get evicted for real. And there's privacy to be had there. Total 'it's-your-space' privacy.   I'm also sort of tired of being at the Family's beck and call. For the most part, we've had to avoid making plans due to some last minute familal commitment or another. I like them, they're good people. However, flopping on the couch, ignoring the relatives, and taking a big ol' nap isn't in good form.  Not so much on the news front. Kurt's got three marks so far: A, and two A-. Not bad, considering he hadn't his books for over half the semester. And I'm tired. Sleeping pill works, but only up to a point. I'm still waking up a lot; still sleeping fitfully with what seems to be an excessive amount of nightmares. I've got the energy of a post-turkey dinner couch potato all the time. But hey, I'm relaxed.  Worse festive fates than being drowned in eggnog: mistletoe poisoning head trauma by fruitcake bored to death by relatives strangled by garland electrocuted by Christmas lights trampled during Boxing week sales   Ok, little sidenote here, because I'm cranky, sad, tired, and feeling insecure. I'm a regular reader of Granger's blog. She's been getting shit on intermittently since her Horrid Camp Days on her 'shout outs'. This pisses me off. Sure, sure, free country and all that hoo haa, but fuck, calling her mean on HER blog, and not signing it, or leaving any sort of recourse for Granger to discuss why this person has a problem to begin with? Two words: chicken shit. Also, I find it hard to believe that Granger is the malicious type. Ok, end of pointless rant.

      I'm not dead, I've not been eaten by in-laws, or drowned in a pool of egg nog. I'm merely at Kurt's parents place, place of much room, weirdish people, and no internet. Today, however, I'm up at my folks' place, waiting to meet one of my Dad's friends, and preparing to clean at a lady's place with mom and pol.   The division of time between my folks' and kurt's parents is working out remarkably well, despite some shit at the beginning of the vacation. I have to admit, though, that being at Kurt's parents' place is awkward. There's no smoke, lots of space and privacy, but I always have the sense that my pants are down around my ankles, or I'm trying to eat with my feet. Nonspecific weirdness. Annie, K's mom's moronic mop of a dog is so happy with us, she greets us with excessive wagging and urinating. She's cute, but very insistant. Phoebe loathes her.   Knitting is going surprisingly well. I'm not overly terrific at it, but there is a steady improvement that keeps me interested. I have one stitch down, and I'm planning on mastering the reverse of it before leaving the City.  That's all for now. Will write again when i have an internet connection again.

      The City: it smells like pigeon poo, and it's busy, so busy it makes my eyes blurry and my throat dry. I wholeheartly wish my family didn't smoke. Lucas, Kurt, Phoebe, and I can only assume myself, are snoring at every possibility of unconciousness. Clothes smell smoky, I can feel it in my skin, and in my hair. Despite the discomfort both domestic and out-of-doors, it feels ok to be here.  Phoebe and Lucas are sliding into life here as easily as a wet seal through a well buttered tube. Phoebe is very interested in stairs, and the other occupants of the house; if someone is inaccessible to her, she meows piteously, and demands entry. She has her own special chair, and a perch on the landing, where she may observe everyone.  On Tuesday, we stay at Kurt's parent's place for about a week. No smoke there, but I do feel antsy and peculiar about staying there. It's just me being silly, I'm sure. Nonetheless, my parents are the devil I know, and there's comfort there.  More later.

      So I�m sitting in a bar, with a hideous bag in front of me. Phoebe, however, is content in her ugly ass carrier; she�s been mellow yellow since we got to the airport. The car ride was a different matter altogether; she tried to convince me to let her out of the bag many thousands of times. Now, she�s content to watch people, and let people pet her. (She�s drawing a significant amount of attention.)  The sleeping pills have been working really well; there�s no loss of control, or that smacked-upside-the-head-with-a-solid-plank feeling. However, I�ve been taking a full one the last few nights, and I�ve been one sleepy, sleepy individual. No coma, though.  My mom let me know that she was unimpressed with my choice to court the world of sleep medication. There�s irony there, folks. Deep seated irony.

      Just in case you weren't aware: No one wants to listen to your music. No one especially doesn't want to listen to your music when it's a syncopated back rythmn pulsating through the floor/walls/ceiling. No one particularily wants to have this rythmn pulsating through her consciousness at, say 10am. Or, come to think of it, 5am. On repeat. So do no one a favor, and buy some fucking headphones before no one shoves your stereo equipment, cds, and nearby furniture up your ass. Sideways.  I think I may have an agression problem. Or maybe I'm an old, bitter bat, yelling at the damn kids to get off the lawn, and wondering why more people don't listen to music at a reasonable volume, or, for heaven's sake, read a bloody book, do a puzzle, or something quiet. The most popular boys in the world are really, really getting to me, to the point where Kurt's calling attention to my whines and foul language whenever i hear anything from those asshats. I  think it began with the crap on repeat all night, hammering through my floor. Or, maybe it was when they pounded on their ceiling (my floor) for Kurt and Giraffe to be quiet after rocking the house all day long, and all the night previous. Or maybe it's simply because it's bad, bad music, and they shamelessly listen to this audio fecal matter allllllllll the frigging time.  Or like I said before, I could be bitter. (They are, after all, popular.)  Last of the blood tests came in, and i am offically disease free. Was shitting my pants over this last one; the doc and myself had the notion that i might have systemic lupus. But no, no lupus. Evidently, she still wants me to go back for more tests after Christmas, because it's a tricky disease to diagnose. But so far, disco.  Up since 5.00am this morning, and I feel like a corpse. Kurt's been watching me all day to make sure I don't nap. It's 7.30pm, and all i can think is "In an hour, I get to sleep." The doctor changed my meds around a bit. Remember high school, or perhaps maybe elementary, when all the cool kids exclaimed "take a Valium!" Now, I can. Well, it's not exactly valium. It's a habit-forming benzodiazepine which 'causes drowsiness during medical procedures.' I'm on to the big leagues now; soon I'll be smoking crack.  The kinder, gentler sleeping pills that only put me down for three hours on the outside have been shelved in favor of these rhino tranquilizers. I wonder what year I'll wake up after taking one...

      Woke up with my face stuck to a bedrooled pillow at 4am, haven't been back to sleep. I just don't understand my body. 18 hours of sleep, 16 hours of sleep, and just when i start to think that i might have mono, no sleep at all.   But, during my comatose state, I had the best dream ever. I'll level with you, it was a strange, peculiar dream, and makes no sense, but i think about it and i can't stop giggling like pigtailed schoolgirl. I dreamt I was in the bathroom, looking at my reflection. I had to sneeze, so i grabbed my nose. When I opened my eyes, my right ear had poufed up like a strange little ear balloon. As I stared at it, the poufyness subsided. I began to wonder how it happened, and thought maybe if i blew air through my nose while gripping my nose tightly, i could inflate the ear again. And, success! I poufed my ear up really, really large, and watched it slowly deflate, wondering why my left ear didn't pouf up as well. I can't tell who how many times I did it. It was frigging fun, anyways. But then, disaster struck. My ear refused to deflate. I squeezed the ear, no go, and it seemed to me if i kept pressing, I'd have an exploded ear spread over the side of my face. I could hear Kurt stirring in the bedroom, and I thought "Damn, he's going to kill me!" Covering my ear, i went to the Room of Pillows, and found a tack. I rushed back into the bathroom, locked the door, and poked a couple of holes in my ear. It deflated. I wiped away the bit of blood, and i thought to myself, "Well, hell. There's holes in there now, I wonder if it'll inflate again? I really shouldn't try." I tried it again, of course, and the ear poufed up real nice, and deflated on its own. I woke up then, completely happy, and content with the world. The moral of this tale? Inflated ears make a person happy.    urlLink   http://www3.telus.net/~dreamgrl/pages/dream.html#  Check out August. Raaaooowwwrrr!! This, my loyal readers, is a girl who is not only hot, but unbelieveably cool. Watch for her boobs in the upcoming Heidi Fleiss movie. And, she's lactose intolerant, so don't feed her cheesecake. (I wanted to tell the entire story, "August", but Pol said you'd cry. And if that happened, I fear you may kick my ass.)  Found a driver for our cross country excursion. I can't believe how hard it was trying to find someone who was free, and who actually drove a standard on a regular basis. The road to the airport is notorious for killing people, so putting someone inexpericed behind the wheel of that tricky, damn fruity civic wasn't something i was comfortable with.  Doctor visit tomorrow. I feel like i see that woman entirely too often.

      At four am three nights ago or so, i threw a shoe at a gorrilla-sized cat who was trying to eat Einstein's face. It never ceases to amaze me that cats can make such a wide variety of noises, at such a variety of volumes. The yowling was nowhere near one of my windows, and yet woke me from a drug induced sleep. This shoe throwing has become a semi-regular thing, too. I'm not sure where the gorrilla cat comes from, although my guess is some sort of hell dimension.   And yeah, I love animals. But I do eat them, and occasionally, i will throw a shoe or a rock or something at a creature that's attacking a creature with whom I have a relationship. Especially when it comes close to outweighing me. That was a BIG cat.  Welcome to December, Ladies and Gentlemen. It's true what they say, about time flying when you're in a coma. I think I'm still stuck over in June somewhere. I really didn't realise how years shoot by; I'm not sure if at this point I should be contemplating my mortality, or feeling old. Don't really feel like either, but it does seem that the world as I know it has somehow picked up speed.  Finding a person to drive the damn car to the airport is getting just plain silly. First nominee was Branflakes. I thought it would be more convient for Yojimbo to drive, so, i put Bran off, thinking, well, hey, it'd just be less fuss for Bran, and so on. We got our flight changed to get the pooch on the plane, and Yojimbo and Bran are no longer options, as they both have pesky, pesky exams. Everyone else appears to be either hopelessly engaged, or unable to drive a stick; it may come down to Kurt or myself teaching someone how to do it. Suggestions, of course, are always welcome.

      Ok, getting excited about the job thing; which means a slight increase in panic. So many ways to fuck it right up. I can't even conceive of what I'll be doing, but I'm damn scared. And looking forward to it. And panicking. And planning on where I'll put the new desk, where I'll WORK FROM HOME ON!! And worrying.  Mojo and warm fuzzy feelings to Morgan, who has a dr's appointment to discuss tests next week. That guy's been through enough already, and he has a shitty job. Take care, Morgan, and thanks for tuning in to As The Roblog Turns.  Question for everybody, and this is a toughie: Do i tell good stories? If so, what story should I tell at a spoken word concert? You people, so far, have sucked at commentary. This is a cry for assistance. Come on, give me advice, tell me what to do, rename my blog, and comment more! (Granger, Minako and Jeffypoo, keep up the good work.)  BassieDoc and therapy are going ok. I still really hate going. I'm agitated for the rest of the day when i talk to her. It doesn't seem that the therapy ends when i leave her office; it just keeps going on in my brain, analyzing, and getting under my skin. Nightmares have been starting up as well. I dream a lot. A lot of the dream are disturbing, and all that, but lately, I've had cold sweat nightmares. Two nights ago, I dreamt one of my favorite profs was hit by a car. Awful. Kurt ran to call the ambulance, and I was doing a c-spine on the prof, and taking of layers of clothing to keep him warm. The prof kept on trying to get up, and i remember that the back of his head was bloody. i woke up before the dream was resolved, and the nightmare is still bugging the shit out of me. It's not a question of what it means. It might have been that at first; but what's bothering me is the utter horror of watching someone get swatted by a car.  Man. From the age of about 14, all I wanted to do was be a paramedic or an emergency room doctor. My brain is still full of those skills. There was a satisfaction in that study, and in that practice, although there were scary times, crying times, and the deadend feeling times during those emergencies. I was good at it all. But there's no way, and I mean NONE that I'm mentally capable of handling such things now. I still have confidence in my abilites, no question. But the emotional aftermath, well, that's something else. Even when one of those deals goes well it still can rip every nerve out of your body. It seems to me that I don't have many of those nerves left.  It's 2.05am. Do you know where your spark is?

      Got a letter from the gov't the other day, opened it, read it, said they were suckers.  The jist: the fruity purple civic is roadworthy and insured until the end of march. Hopefully by that time, meaningful employment will be secured, and we can start paying for more insurance. And meaningful employment does look fairly good; thanks to Big Bad Red.  And speaking of floppy pancakes; I've been in bed all day. I was able to get up and put away the dishes, and let out the dog,and that was it for my energy levels. I cannot even begin to express my relief that this depletion of energy isn't something that a person of more strength could surpass.  Kurt did get awarded a bursary amounting to two months' rent and a car payment.  My mom is sending me a computer sans monitor, unless of course she can find me one in the next week or so.  and that's it for news.

      Did more research on fibromyaglia. It was depressing, but informative. Evidently, this disease is neurological; it waxes and wanes, and explains even more than I could have thought. For example, the last few months I've been falling down randomly, and running into doorframes. This would be pretty normal fare if I was taking a leak after a couple hours sleep, but no, I'd be all wide awake and bushy-tailed, inexplicably running into things. Other things too, that I figured were unrelated to anything else, and stuff I passed off as being psychosomatic turn out to be earmarks of this entirely baffling condition. I mean, who would have thought that memory problems could be connected to bowel problems, and those things could be connected to running into walls?  New D&D group on Fridays, with some cool people. Been to only one session so far, and aside from being completely whacked out exhausted by the end of the night; it was really fun. And an added bonus, I wasn't all jittery and antsy like I am typically when I leave the sanctity of my fortress of solitude. Added to this small victory, Kurt, Muppet and myself participated in the pre-bar birthday celebration of Granger, who can now enter a bar any damn place she wants to. Would have stayed for all the fun and excitement, and the dancing, but Kurt and I were feeling like floppy pancakes. We came home, he went directly to bed, and I managed to scrape together one more hour of consciousness, as S.D came over to get mulleted and photographed. He left with his hair in his bag, and two keepsake braids. I've never cut anyone's hair before. I must say it's liberating to do, especially when the desired haircut is supposed to be absolutely hideous.

      Ask, and you shall receive. After a number of tests, pokes and proddings, I have been diagnosed with Fibromyaglia, a disease I hve no prayer of ever saying correctly on a regular basis. According to the  F.N (http://www.fmnetnews.com/pages/basics.html) it is :  "FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome) is a widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue disorder for which the cause is still unknown. Fibromyalgia means pain in the muscles, ligaments, and tendons – the soft fibrous tissues in the body.   Most patients with FMS say that they ache all over. Their muscles may feel like they have been pulled or overworked. Sometimes the muscles twitch and at other times they burn. More women than men are afflicted with FMS, and it shows up in people of all ages.   To help your family and friends relate to your condition, have them think back to the last time they had a bad flu. Every muscle in their body shouted out in pain. In addition, they felt devoid of energy as though someone had unplugged their power supply. While the severity of symptoms fluctuate from person to person, FMS may resemble a post-viral state. This similarity is the reason experts in the field of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) believe that these two syndromes may be one and the same. Gulf War syndrome also overlaps with FMS/CFS. "   Mmmmm, post-viral states. Uncharacteristically, I've not done a shitload of research on it, at least, not yet. Evidently it won't kill me, there are treatments, and it explains a lot. Alas, it is a long term shitty deal, but it's a long term shitty deal that is all nice and tangible, and not at all in my head.   Granger: good point on that whole finishing my education thing; I guess I typically see my undergrad as being an inevidibility rather than a goal.  Not much other news is happening. We're waiting to hear back from bursary application, to see if we can continue to eat and pay bills for the rest of the semester. At this point in time, we've got about 90$ in the bank account, left over from student loans to pay bills and feed us til the end of the semester. Thank you, Alberta. This bursary program is new at the university, and isn't in the hands of the previous alloters; so appendages are crossed, prayers are being prayed, and wishes are being made on little tiny stars. Also, when i go back to BassieDoc I'm going to ask about gov't help with our situation.  It's 10.52; the latest I've stayed awake since christmas. Go me! Bed now.

      The assessment is over. According to the therapist, (we'll call her BassieDoc) I'm only half-treated. Lots has been done for me on the spinning lazy susan of drugs, but as for consistant cognitive therapy, i haven't had the experience of a sympathetic therapist with a few years under her belt. The good doctor, I'm led to believe, has seen lots of little fruitcakes like myself, and she was either intutive enough, or smart enough to know exactly how she could get me to go to therapy regularily; said "nothing else has worked, right? So why not try this?" and she's making me first on her cancellation list, so i can't really just sort of drift away.   God, do I hate it. I know it's worth doing, and I'm commited to doing it, but I hate it. Stuff is being dregged up that I thought I had either dealt with, or safely compartmentilized. Basically, I didn't deal with anything, just buried it down deep to become the product of weepy beer nights and bouts of self-pity and crankiness. I'd like to think i DID deal with these things. But I haven't, and I'm fifteen, or nine, or twenty one again, trying to figure out precisely what's making me feel like shit, and trying not to get frustrated with the figuring.  It's rather tiring.  The Most Popular Boys in the World had a party on Friday. I had the stomach flu, was not feeling the slightest bit neighbourly, and so called the cops. After a bit, the music had not stopped, and a guy showed up on my step. I assumed he was around for the party and came to the wrong door, as a few others did that night. I gave him directions, and he looked confused, so i sarted explain again. Turns out, though, that he was one of TMPBITW, coming to ask me for leniancy on the party. I sort of looked at him blankly and nodded a few times, the party rocked on until 2am or so. After this meeting, a few things occured to me; that A) the guy probably thought i was very confused, and wasn't the person who called the police, or B) I was sort of mental. I know he looked sufficiently confused when he left. I've been ruminating over my actions, i wasn't being nice, or charitable towards those guys, and I'm sort of sorry. I'm not entirely sure yet if I'm sorry enough to appologize. We'll see.  We're offically in Peasant Status; the insurance on the gay little civic has gone away, and we've no means to get some more. Saves money this way, but it's winter, and I'm a wuss, so expanding my horizions socially looks to be a far bigger task than ever it was. Besides, it's winter, and w/v is a hill. Part of my homework with the therapist addresses this issue;(not the hill issue, but the isolationist issue) before my next appointment, I'm to call the lady I near drooled over at the Sheep Fur Farm Place. I tried telling BassieDoc that my exuberance was more than likely unsettling to the Weaving Lady, BassieDoc told be to grow some cojones, and call anyways. Eeeeh. Maybe I'll email.  Another part of my homework is listing goals, no matter the feasiblity. Got any ideas? Send them my way, along with suggestions for a blog title. Get busy, people.  The goals so far are: Spending time in every national park in canada Get published Learn to crochet, weave, felt, and other things to facillitate me becoming a Craftsperson Buy a huge amount of land, so I can run a non-kill humane society; that way i can take any and all animals that need a home. Live in Trinidad Learn another language Take care of mine and Kurt's parents   That's all i can think of for now. You people know me, did i leave anything out?

      I would have written sooner, but I've spent most of the time since the City unconscious. found the cure for insommnia, anyways; evidently it's miserably long plane rides heading East. Still feel like I've been hit by a truck, though, rest is just not as restful as it ought.  Saw a brand-spanking-new therapist lady today, after 50 minutes, we're not complete her assesment of me. I'm complicated. Next time we get into my sordid past, and find out what makes me crazy/tick. She did say it was clear that I had a long term, chronic illness. So, i have that going for me, which is nice.  Lots and love and sympathy and virtual casseroles to Minako.

      Well, I'm home.  Important sentance, that. Took me a couple years to figure it out, but over the course of the holidays, I came to realise that W/V as much as i complain about it, is home.  Home has always been an important concept for me. My folks sold the house i grew up in when i was in university. Thought my home was that place. There really is no going home again. I love it there, no question, i dream of it, and I'd like to spend another chunk of my life there. But it's not home now. Other people live in that house, my grandparents' house is a memory, and the parents are halfway across the country. Eventually, I went to them, looking for home.   There is a piece of home with my family. Just a piece, though (A most important piece). Went sort of baskety wondering where the other pieces scurried off to. Found another one with Kurt, and I figure those two must have had babies, because between the dealio with my folks, and being in the vast, stinking Valley with Kurt, I'm awfully happy to be here. And here is home, right now w/v, but i think mainly home is with kurt, or my family.   We did not have a retarded layover of over a day in Winterpeg. That's what was originally planned, but the dear lady at Air Canada fixed our shit over so we got the red eye. Got home at 11am or so. I'm weeping, longing for bed, and I've got the flu to boot, but I'm going to try and hang on to conciousness as long as i can in hopes of repairing my sleep schedule. Ten million dollars says it's not going to happen..but i got goals, mister, i got goals.  Speaking of goals, knitting is ok. The backstitch is frigging hell, though. I get three rows, and its so tight i could snap the yarn, or the knitting needles. Practice is in order.

      I have this song stuck in my head.   No ordinary song, but a flash video called  "Badger, Badger,Badger,Badger,Badger, Mushroom, Snake". It's weird, and extremely catchy. For all you perverts out there, it isn't dirty. You can find it here :  urlLink  badger, mushroom, snake  Not much happening in the way of news. Work, sleep at odd hours, daily feelings of being pummeled, then run over by a buick, eating, dorking it up, more sleeping, more eating, work, and whining because, well, it feels like I've been excessively pummeled, and then after the pummelation, i was run over by a buick.  We are on the cusp, my gentlefriends, of becoming Us- Reliant; hopefully, in a few weeks/month, we'll be able to pay all our bills handily. Without the awful and necessary parental handouts. After that, the next goal is to pay off debts. (Let's not be hasty, though, yesterday we needed a church handout for foodstuffs. Thank God for people like Roger and Marilyn.  We purchased a large bag of tropical trail mix.  It's mostly gone, i'd say. Interesting thing about it though, it lists all the ingredients, which is well and good. There's even a breakdown of what goes in a banana chip. Nice and thorough, right? At the end of the list lies a mystery; it says " ....pineapple, dates, vegetable." I'm suspicious. Ought we know what type of vegetable it is? Isn't it peculiar that we aren't informed what type of this vegetable might be? I don't know about you, but I think it's time we break out the tinfoil hats.  Trazodonze is not proving to be as relieving as the doctor thought. It would be more accurate to say that it provides no relief at all, but i guess i should wait around for a while yet. I've figured out my predjudice about drugs, by the way; I think a large part of my hatred comes from the fact that my health and well being rely heavily on drugs, and i resent that reliance. So, when someone talks about taking drugs as a recreational thing, i have the sudden urge to squish their trachea. It doesn't help matters that i was addicted to seroquel for just over a year, either.  Strike at the university is offically on, and there are many whispers concerning the length. Most say that the strike will last weeks rather than days. The profs are pissed, and clearly unhappy with the turn of events; the students are pissed off, drunk, and making lots of noise; and who knows what the hell the adminstrating is doing.   Hopefully, Kurt and i will be able to benefit from the cessation of classes; we're getting the PC any day now, so he'll be able to work. Speaking of which, anyone got a desk i can borrow?  Oh, yes. The happy feeling regarding fibromyaglia has disappated. I'm all right with that; i was starting to think i was a little masochistic.  Don't eat any yellow snow.

      Usefulness has offically commenced, so YaY!   The province was in a State Of Emergency yesterday. Today, the fruity purple civic is covered to the top of its purple fruityness. I woulddearly love to hav a camera, and the means to post the pictures up here, but alas, you're just going to have to picture it. Kurt's hoping that Spring will assert itself and clean off the car for him; i sort of doubt it, though.  Gotta go be a D&D dork now.

      'New drug on the menu: Trazodone. Sounds rather like something Pinky would use as an expletitive. I give 'er a whirl tonight, and we'll see if it helps me sleep and lessens the fibro pain. I'm also hoping it'll aid in reversing my sleep schedule; both Kurt and i are nocturnal, and it sort of sucks. The drugs are courtesy of BassieDoc, and i must say, i hate going to see her. I hate talking. I hate, and i mean HATE obsessing about everything that was said in the session for the entire day afterward. One thing i like though; she yawns a few times every session, and she's an extremely proficient closed-mouth yawner - i love watching her. She is a really nice person, and a good doctor, but the thought of going to see her again pisses me off just thinking about it.  Completed the training stuff for work, been waiting since Monday to get assigned to something. Red and Aki assure me that sometime in the near future I'll be doing some work. Waiting sucks, though, I'm too excited about being useful, functional, and other good things to be overly patient about it. (Plus, i like coding; my brain says "Oh boy, a puzzle!") Kurt's still lollygagging in his training; but it's his spring break, can't say I blame him.  Speaking of breaks; it looks like Kurt and his fellow Students are getting an extend-a-break. According to one of Kurt's profs : 'A strike date has been set for this Monday morning.  This doesn't mean that a strike is 100% certain.  It is possible that the two sides could work out a deal in the interim.  But if that doesn't happen, the strike will commence Monday morning.' I hope the profs get what they've been fighting for, and I'm very thankful they weren't locked out- that would have be disastrous for the faculty.   Ich bin mude.

      I've been sitting in front of this dratted post for two days. I've got nothing to say. Or, at least, I'll try and type something, and whatever it was slides out of my brain. Stuff sliding out my brain seems to be somewhat the norm lately. Case in point; from here to the beginning of the post has taken me about 20 minutes.   I think it's due to lack of sleep, and an excess of crappy feeling. I go to the doctor tomorrow...but i can't seem to recall what time my appointment is. I phoned, though, so I'll probably get a call tomorrow morning.  That's it for now.

      Ok now, I'm not getting slack on keeping up with Bloggerland. It is simply that nothing has happened the last week or so, at least nothing overmuch in my immediate vicinity. Rest assured, if Stuff were happening, I'd be posting a few times a day at least.  Such is not the case, although last night was definitely in my books for being altogether odd. First oddity was that i babysat for Herr Landlord and Lady. First of all, Herr in this couple makes me freakishly uncomfortable; i'm talking Lana's kryptonite necklace around Clark in highschool. The man would come close to making me physically sick with unease. To this we add a Creepy Situation; where around midnight, i had my face chatted of by Herr, who was invading my personal space and being Intense. In the dark. While I was wearing pjs. When i escaped, i went to the apratment below us, where the 24 party people live now, but was then occupied by two gentle baker girls. The baker girls told me their own harrowing tales of Herr's creepiness, and i avoided him for about a year.  Anyways, sat on their babies i did, and  i got along with the Landlords famously. I think Herr still has the ability to make me vomit from uncomfort, but last night they moved to the People I Like and Care About catergory.  Driving home a few hours later, i was flagged down by a young couple. The female of this couple looked like a friend i hadn't seen in years, and the male of the couple looked just as familiar. I was flagged down because of a poor shoe choice, and the three of us chatted pleasantly all the way up the hill. We decided that meeting one another and looking familiar to one another was too interesting to merely shrug about, so we decided that we'd extend our aquaintence. I dropped them off, came home, and decided to call the number i was given by the couple at once. The person on the other end of the line and i became fast friends. There are tentative plans to meet in person.  So, three friends in twenty minutes. Not bad at all for a social recluse.   I may have to sell Phoebe to the gypsies. We've had her for roughly a year now, and it's been fairly recent since she began acting like a cat, and thusly becoming the bane of my existance. She's into things. She tears around the apartment chasing after something only she can see, and when we're cosy in our room, which is the only heated room in the winter, she demands to be let loose to run wildly about. She stands on her hind legs, and makes heroic attempts to reach the doorknob. When if becomes clear to her that she won't be growing any more, she lies down and scratches, and meows to be let out. And, she doesn't give up. I let her out, crawl back into bed, and just as i'm drifting off again the same demandingness happens on the other side of the door. She does NOT give up. Upon opening the door, she scurries back in, and cuddles up to Kurt's feet, satisfied she's rid the apartment of haunts for that night. This happens about four times a night. I can deal. However, in the last week and a bit, something has altered in her habits. The noise on the other side of the door happens. I open the door. She sits down, and begins licking herself. I bend to scoop her up, and she runs off to hide under furniture. I don't typically chase her. I'll close the door, and she'll start again, as soon as i'm back in bed and comfortable. It doesn't help my mood that the rest of the place is pretty damn cold, and my sense of balance has deteriorated. Fricken cat. She's also added another weirdness to herself, around 11pm, in the midst of her exising demons, she'll jump into the tub, and growl, for about 5-9 minutes a session. I know the phrase 'weird cat' is redundant, but man, she's a weird cat.

      Another busy week. I'm not complaining; but i did have a disturbing revelation: I've been happy. For a while, now. That's not the disturbing part. The disturbing part is that the start of this newfound happy and contentedness concides perfectly with the dianose of fibromyalgia.   "Robyn. You have a chronic, incurable illness. It won't kill you, but, it sucks."  "Are you sure, doctor?"  "Yes, yes I am."  "Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!"  I think i understand why i'm happy, though. Shit is offically explained. I've been achey, sleepy, feeling like crap, and sick all the time, and now, i know why. I can't remember who said it, but it has been said that people prefer an explained world to one that isn't - even if that world is very poorly explained.   I keep on thinking, though, what would happen if i walked into the doctor's office, and she told me that she had made a mistake in her diagnosis?   Went to training on Saturday. It was good, i learned a bunch and got to interact with Aki and Red. (Well, not so much Aki..) Kurt and i got lost twice, and i was violently ill; some sort of weird stomach flu bug. There were about four cars off the road on the highway heading home, the roads were utter shit, and i had the window wound down most of the way home due to nausea. I was so totally going to bed after i got off the phone with my folks. But, it was Saturday. Saturday is SD day, where he and Kurt play video games until dawn. An unexpected guest was CBG, and then, to round off the night, drunken minako came to crash. It was a veritable revolving door of friends. It was great. Well, despite the incessant feeling that i was going to puke some more. Minako took that over, though, she was one sick puppy.  She took us to the Big Stop for lunch today, and was much healthier than i would have expected.  I'm still excited about work.

      I feel like ass. And man, you do not want to know what my ass feels like. Off the horse tranqulizer sleeping pills, in order to get put on some newfangled medicine that will help me sleep, manage fibromynalgia symptoms (god, what a hard name to say; the only way i can remember how to say it is to think 'leggo my eggo' first...) and, you know, whatever else may crop up. (Inoperable brain cancer.)  Busy week for me so far, had either people over or went out somewhere every day since Thursday. It's been great, but i think i may die. Or sleep for a week or so. Granger helped me learn some mad html skills, at least, i think it was html; anyways, that's why the page looks different. Red and white, unless on a flag, looks pretty bright and obnoxious to me. I think, though that more changing of the chromatic kind is going to happen; black and gray and white look spiffy enough, but it reminds me a bit too much of my dressing-all-in-black-writing-horrifically-bad-poetry days. And yeah, Minako, the title is likely to continue vacillitating as well. 'Slippers in the snow' sounds nice, though, hey?   Got an email from a webmaster type the other day:  Hello,   I am creating a web directory, The-Insight.com, and would like to include your website Getahelmet.blogspot.com under the "spirituality/numerology" category. If you'd like to be added, please follow this url:   http://www.the-insight.com/add.cgi  We shall put all our efforts into having your link up in less than 24 hours; and if you find our site useful for your visitors, please add a reciprocal link.   Link Back :  urlLink  The-Insight.com   - A Spirituality Web Directory.  Thank you very much, James T webmaster  Didn't do it yet. I may not, because, well, numerology? What the hell? I don't even like numbers. The site seems all right, anyways, no porn pop ups or crap about healng stones or whatever.   Training for jobby thing this weekend. I can't help it, I'm all excited. Got high-speed internet yesterday for it, and the computer is still in calgary, but, Pol assures me it'll get here eventually. I want it yesterday. i want to get a fancy schmancy desk to put the computer on as well, but for now, the noble kitchen table will suffice.   Hmm. You know, I'm not entirely sure I think I'm lazy anymore. I reaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly want to be productive, and creative, and i want to be able to do stuff well, and i think that if i were lazy, i wouldn't so much be interested in anything. Making money is important insofar as it pays the bills and feeds us; but there is this hopeful feeling that I'll be helping Kurt out a lot more by doing something to pay the bills.   Of course, i may get lost, or the car may blow up on the way to training; i may hate it, Red may find me incompetant, and i may find the other people I'm in contact  with regarding work insufferable. Definitely worried about the incomptetence thing; but Red, and Aki have been very supportive, and assuring me that I'll be just fine.   Kurt is offically double honors in philosophy and political science. I am proud. Now he's got to fill out stupid scholarships forms.

      Good weekend. Despite reservations involving sickness and fatigue, managed to go shopping in three stores, and cooked dinner for a few people. It was some stew boogieage, and although the guests we somewhat off on their timing (SD didn't get to meet our new friend CBG) much enjoyment was had.   On Friday, we had D&D. Much fun. So tiring. Both days are going to require massive healing on my part, can barely move today, and although i promised to take Lucas for a walk, well, it just couldn't happen. It's winter, right? (Who wants to go outside in winter?)  Saw "The Butterfly Effect" on thursday. I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan. On his two shows so far he plays a dolt and and asshole, and i rather assumed he IS a dolt and an asshole. Well, if he is, he gave a bloody spectacular performance in the movie. If he's not a dolt and an asshole, still a great performace, along with the rest of the cast. It was one of those movies that are emotionally impacting, and it is not your typical Hollywood ending, which i apperciate. And, almost every character went through insane changes throughout the movie, so I think no one could accuse any person in it of having no range. Anyways, good movie. It's one of those movies where i'd say you're missing out if you haven't seen it.   Still trying to figure out what I should put together for the whole story telling thing, but I'm not entirely sure of how long it's supposed to be, and whether or not telling a children's story would be appropriate. And, can one read? Or is it supposed to be commited to memory?   Also, trying to strangle the excitement of the jobby thing. I don't want to get excited. I get excited, and Something kicks me in the keister and things end up sucking. I have to be all mellow yellow, and be keen, but not get excited, because that will lead to counting chickens before they're actually chickens, and making God laugh because i made plans. Yay, hysterics.

      So, i got  urlLink this  in my e-mail today. For those of you who don't want to get all linky, here's the gist. Antidepressants are causing the symptoms that they're supposed to help control. Among these are:  Prozac/Fluoxetine - What I'm on now Zoloft -been on it Paxil - Been on it:suicide attempt 1 Luvox - suicide attempt #3 Celexa - been there Lexapro  Wellbutrin  Effexor - Suicide attempt #2 Serzone  Remeron   I have noticed that a lot of anti-robyn behaviour occurs if there's any changes in meds.   Right, so I'm thinking, get off the drugs (but they seem to be keeping me on the level.) Also, were those suicide attempts because i was mentally unsound because of my condition, or my treatment? Looking back into old journals tells me that I never tried to kill myself until i was 4 months into paxil. Is it a coincidence, or what? Is there an action that needs to be taken?   On the plus side, instead of panic, I'm experiencing anger. Anyways.  Been getting largely heroic amounts of sleep. It's pretty nice, but I seem to be moving back into the land of the undead. Work is going nicely, I'm getting shit done, and i haven't gotten any batches back. (Yes! I'm a good coder!) I must say that this job is suited to me rather nicely. It excercise my brain in weirdish ways, and i've got that sense of accomplishment thing happening. I still want to go back to school, but I can definitely see me doing this for a long time.  If you have quicktime, and like the creepy, you have to see this. It's a mini-movie entitled  urlLink  The Cat With Hands . Be warned, though, it's damn creepy (Just ask Granger - sorry again!)  I'm scrounging around in my head to find any sort of interesting tidbits, and I got nothing. All I've been doing is working, doing homeish thing and nursing my isolationism to a largish sized loathing of the general populace. The last gross bits of snotty ungoodness are fading away, and Kurt's symptoms are at the pinnacle of disgusting. We went through more toilet paper that can be easily conceived.  The hand-me-down compy is still not working, and I'm almost beyond caring. I do know of a certain school that's selling these laptops for 650 at the end of the year, so it's a choice between saving up for that, or fixing the tower, buying a new monitor, etc. A monitor would be cheaper, but I'm much more familar with the laptop, it has much more space, and laptops are something I'm more accustomed to than a pc. Thoughts, anyone?  I'm waiting for spring.

      Robyn sick, but needs to blog anyways:  Today I'll be discussing skinny girls, dream jobs, old goodness, trancendental experiences of god, and some other random stuff.  Let's begin with skinny girls. I'm not one. Evidently I never was one, in the best of shape i was still fairly squat, and i heard the term 'brick shit house' applied to me more than once. i was strong, slow on the swim, but quick on the sprint, and had endurance. Go me. Then University happened, with its designated feeding times, and i no longer had any impetus to keep in shape so, i just stopped being active. Didn't really notice a change until i came home after first year. I did not bring home a 'frosh fifteen'; it was thirty five pounds. I became padded, and pretty much stayed that way.  Most of the time, I'm ok with that. I'm curvy, not heinous to look at. Bigger, yeah huh, but I'm happy to eat, happy to lounge, and i can still hike and swim which are really the only active things i enjoyed. Other training was strictly for being a decent lifeguard. I hate running. Swimming laps in a pool drive me nuts, and the gym makes me feel like a hamster. I'd  be happy to chop wood, and haul it in, but i live in an apartment. When kurt and i settle down, i want to live in a house, have barn, have some chickens, dogs, and a horse, as well as cats. Logistics of that are pending. Anyways, my point is, I'm happy with how i look.  Most of the time.  Skinny girls can wear anything they want, and have it still look good. I remember a chick i saw in a bar one summer. She was lovely, skinny, and she was wearing a bandanna as a shirt. It didn't look skanky, it looked comfortable, flirty, and covered plenty of area, while still showing the tanned skin on her back. It was nice. At the beach that summer, i saw plenty of girls wear cool looking two pieces, you know the ones; the boy shorts. Surfer girl clothes. I was envious. Still am. It's entirely too bad that i simply don't care enough to be that skinny.  My dad says it's because clohes look better on a hanger. True. But, can skinny girls wear cool clothes.  Dream jobs for me (in no particular order):  1) Run a HUGE no-kill humane society, where no animal gets the furnace, or injection. The mean ones can be mean, off in their own mean place. Nice ones can be kept or adopted out by people we interview. Weird feral cats can be weird and feral, sterilized, and we'd build a place where they can hide and be slinky. Big fenced in fields for friendly well, socialized dogs dogs that want to run, large porch, and a bunch of trees for those who don't. Warm places to sleep for everybody. A veterinarian on hand for emergencies and maintainence. A safe place, a place where old dogs can die in peace, and be buried under rose bushes. It'd be hard. And worth it.  2) Writer of novels, children's stories, movie review columns. Best sellers not required - but i do want to see the things i write published. And no vanity presses either. Also, i think it'd be cool to write an advice column. Why? That I don't know, but it sure seems to be interesting.  3) Stand up comedian. Without the travel, perhaps without the audience, and basically, without any basis in reality.  4) radio dj - for some alternative type of place, not, say Popular Crap 101. But, there is that audience problem...  5) a mom.  6) University prof - preferably a creative writing prof.  7) own and design t-shirts, and cool clothing that everyone can wear.  Kurt keeps telling me i can do it all. Sometimes i believe him. I find that right now, though, my biggest problem is what to do first.   On the topic of old goodness. Shit isn't made nearly as well as it could be, and a damn sight worse than it was. Take cars, for instance. Their frames are less durable, and they're likely to crumple in an accident. The premise is that the frame is absorbing the shock so it doesn't go through passengers' bodies. Doesn't that sound like horseshit? I was hit by a car a few years ago. The rig i was driving crumpled, and the guy that hit me didn't even have paint knocked off. He was driving a 70s monster, and i was driving a newish truckish thing. No one was hurt, but i had the overwhelming sense that if the guy didn't put on his brakes right away he would have ripped the vechicle i was driving in two. Here's the logic to making crappy cars: They wear out, and you buy another. You aren't satisfied, you're still in the market. What makes more money? A satisfied customer, or one that has to replace bits repeatedly? Now apply this premise to just about everything, and welcome to the market.  Wow. That was Kurtlike.  And now, a story :  It was the summer of hell, and i was working an overtime shift that finished just a little after dawn. I was on the green over by where the river leads into the ocean, and for that early in the morning it was hot. After my shift, i went to center beach, and went for a swim. The sun was rising right over the Island, and everything was gold. The water, my skin, the light on sand. It was much prettier than gold jewelery. I had this weird realisation, that i was part of the water, and the sand, and even the light that fell on everything. What happened next is weird, and a comepletely undescribeable Event; to put it bluntly, god donked me on the noggin, told me that i was a part of his plan, and that i was going to be taken care of. Sure I was small, but i fit perfectly. And then there was joy, and peace for a moment. It was an entirely perfect moment.  I went to school after that summer, and my roommate knew that there was something different floating around in my head. I told her what happend, and she got me to read stuff by Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau. The were perfect at describing what had happend to them, and it was the same occurance as mine, with slight variances. I went looking for god. Eventually he found me, but it took a long while after this experience. That is the reason i do believe in god; he popped up and said hi. I do not think that it would be possible any other way for me - i was such a rabid skeptic. It was also a crazy road in between; after that summer i fell into a depressed hole, and couldn't climb out again. Read everything i could handle on god and religions and buddhism and other related topics. Dodged suicide attempts. Eventually, i found what i was looking for; a cd liner that that this message on it. I don't remember it verbatim, but here's the gist: "I looked for Him on the cross, but He wasn't there. I looked under the Bodhi Tree but He wasn't there either. I searched everywhere for Him, only to look into my heart and find Him waiting for me there, all along."  Cry bullshit, believe me, or dimiss it. But He's there, waiting for you, and will wait as long as it takes.  And here comes a brief (hopefully) rant on Christian culture. It's exclusionary, breeds ignorance in the form of safety, and judgement where there ought to be acceptance. Christians do not have the monopoly on judemental behaviour; but they are awfully well known by it. Fact is, everyone judges. I judge, and i feel I'm right. You judge and do the same, but it's all dog farts in the end; a person can never know what's in another person's heart, soul or mind, it is something that is never entirely disclosed. Hell, you can  even surprise yourself. So don't tell me what the bible says about gay folks, or whatever else. It is far worse to abandon someone, a worse mistake to give up hope for other people. God loves everybody, even those freaks in the bible who wanted to bash kids' skulls on rocks, and give away their daughters.  Murderers, rapists. Every single person is loved by god, in the sense that they always have a chance, god always has hope for them. I'm not saying be God, and love these people. Just don't give up, on anybody. Always hope for them.  This is what i find lacking in christian culture; forgiveness, hopefullness, and the sense that we're all playing dress up, really - we aren't christ. We all make mistakes, and some of them are too hideous to imagine. We all miss the mark. So don't look down on anyone (I suppose i really ought to say 'try') unless, of course, you're helping that person up. Andthe point of that somewhat longish blurt - I decided i want to try to do the church thing in the form of a nice little chapel. I figure, well, at least if i'm in the culture, i can help, (oh arrogant but hopeful me) bring some people around to a more accepting way of thinking - without the visits to church, I doubt i'd either get a forum to speak, or a hearing if i spoke. (And you thought I didn't have a point...)  Right. I'll just  urlLink shut the fuck up  about this heavy stuffing now.  Go see "Hildago". Such a good movie.  I love horses. And Viggo, and stories where things are simple. (Well, i love any story, really, but there's something cleansing about a story that just involves a goal.) oh, and Viggo. You can tell that guy chooses movies he's in, just for the hell of it.Check out his filmography  urlLink here.   Enough! I am feverish, and you are crazy! Bedtime!!

      A dim but perceptible weirdness permeated the evening last night. Granger treated me to an up do and hair pulling; and i really started to understand what it is about spas, hairdressers, etc. that make women want to settle down and live in one. That is, if those places were like the place Granger and i went yesterday. The staff were our friends; not friendly, mind you; but friends. They gently teased, they chatted me up, they gave me honest, unedited opinions, and the atmosphere was entirely unlike any other environment i've been in. It was altogether appealing, and i'm going to go again, should my funds allow it. These people take care of you, want to help you look pretty, and i think can really help out with a lady's self esteem. The staff were happy to be working there, and it showed.  Dinner was chicken parmesan al forno, courtesy of Granger, and it was indeed Martha Stewartesque, without the criminal elements. Damn, it was good.  We moved on to the formal reception downstairs, and got into our limos, ten to a car. It was my first time in a limo, and even with ten people in it, it was the most comfortable 45 min or so ride i've ever had. That's saying a lot when one is wearing a dress and shoes that would serve admirably as torture devices.  It was in the reception area of Granger's res that things began to feel surreal. Kurt and I didn't know anyone, and it appeared that no one knew anyone else, either. The people sat in little knots, and there was virtually no interaction. The only person that made a gesture of communicativeness to me was a girl that had recent sent an e-mail to Granger telling her off the other week. Marvelous. I pretended not to know of the situation, and talked of how Granger lent me the dress, paid for my grooming, and fed me. I also pretended not to notice the sideways stare the girl was giving Granger the entire time we were sitting together. I complimented the girl on her dress, asked about her pets, and tried to think what a person ought to do in a situation like that one. I sort of felt like asking the girl probing questions on her bitter bitchiness towards Granger, but then lamed out and just sort of watched the two girls try not to notice one another.  Surrealness followed in the comfort of the limo, and beyond, to the Casino. I have the feeling that if hell were a physical place, it might be there. It was bright, noisy, and chaotic, and i got the sense that few people wanted to be there, but boredom or desperation led them there. (That's a big assumption though, perhaps i was just overwhelmed by the sense that i didn't want to be there.)  Minako came, and offered us a drive to the next spot on the formal's to do list. I enjoyed the club's decor, and the layout, but the bouncers were pure assholery, and well, i was barraged with the fact the eighties have resurfaced fashion wise. Hideous. Girls flounced by wearing clothes that suggested they were on sale, and men stalked by, looking for them. Since none of us could really talk over the music, i went into full observation mode, and started speculating on things. One thing i thought about is why i have less trouble in a bar anxiety-wise than i do in a mall. I came to the conclusion that, well, a person is terrifically anonymous in a bar, much more so than other places. The lighting, the music and the alcohol cause this blurring that's almost dreamlike to me. It's like I'm watching a movie that's surrounding me. This disassociation provides a measure of safety in my brain. There was other stuff floating around in my head as well, like how formal wear seems to be designed to highlight a person's frailty, particularly women, but that's a longish bit, so we'll leave it.   We went for food, and Granger's Boyfriend bought kurt and myself some fries. Good fries. If i were to rate the evening on food; one a scale of one to ten, it was definitely a solid ten. Encountered minako again, and also a girl i've not seen since i was about 17. After doing a brief and scattered catching up deal, the gang went for a tour of the town. We climbed back into the limos at two thirty, and were whisked back to 'vegas.  Did I have a good time? Yes. Would I do it again? I don't think so. I was too tired to dance, and that's my entire reason to go out to a club like dealio. It was too loud to talk, and that'd be my reason to hang out at a pub or coffee shop. Casinos are evil to me. All in all it was the odd bits that made the evening; making faces at The Boyfriend when Granger wasn't looking, the limo ride, the pampering, the dinner, Minako's autobiographical tour of the town. Seeing the town, and everything else for that matter, through tinted windows. Running into the girl from home. Watching the weird human aquarium of the club. And, definitely watching Granger and The Boyfriend curl up into a cuddly mass, and fall semi-asleep.   Other bits: If i continue to work dilligently, we might be straightend out financially by May. Perhaps even sooner if we get the compy up and running properly. That's a pretty big if at the moment. The tower needs fixing, and a new monitor needs to be gotten. The current monitor does work, but it's fuzzy, and in order to do the job, one needs a screen that has perfect resolution. Argh. If it's not one thing, it's usually another, right?  We had an intense D&D session the other night; a member of our party bought it, another went insane, and my own character might not be far behind. It was exhuasting. It re-enforced the notion that the story that the group is spinning ought to be written down. We'll see i guess. I have no idea how to write fight sequences.  That's it. Remember - out of all the people that come and visit this page, you're my favorite.

      There's something seductive and irritating about 'classmates.com'. It's seductive, because i keep on getting these bouncy emails commanding me to go to the site, because Something Interesting Awaits. I remember when i first went there, in old ought one, and thought ' this may be interesting'.   It really isn't.  Captain Obvious tells me that it's a badly run, glorified spam site, and the people who sign up were like me, bored, and got a new computer. They'll never go back, again, and if they do, they aren't going to contact me, since I was mostly invisible. When i wasn't invisible, I was aloof, and a big weirdo. There's a few people I haven't seen since high school, and i would like to see them again to catch up, find out what they're doing and wish them well, but Classmates is not the way to do it, since you're hip wading in crap, and, well, these folks are probably in the zarking telephone book.   Speaking of classmates, I haven't been plagued by moronic dreams of elementary school nightmares lately, I've moved on to famous people and superheros. Superheros i get, but the famous people bit is random; I don't watch tv, haven't seen a current movie in a while, and generally ignore The Outside World. But Madonna, Seth Greene, The cast of Happy Days (minus the Fonze), and various other people I don't normally think about waft in and out of my unconsciousness.   What does it all mean? Ahh, whole lot of 'who cares' is what it means. I'm glad my dreams are entertaining.

      Work, Sleep, Procrastinate, Work. Not a bad schedule, really. Been also hanging out with people like Minako, and CBG, and that's a-prettypretty good. This Saturday cometh the formal, and I'm not entirely sure how that's going to be - I'm entirely grateful for this gift that Granger's given, but me+a dress+drunken people I don't know+staying up real late+unknown variables = a person who's head will explode, OR a person having a terrific time. I mean, well, there ARE limos. But there's also a long nasty road in between, you know? I think pretty well everything i think of that will be good about it, i can offset with some stupid arsed worry that I can't dismiss. But, i do remember not feeling up to going to the Kiss concert, on their freakin' farewell tour. Pol all but kicked my ass to get me to go, and that was the best show ever. Perhaps i ought to avoid thinking about events until the event is upon me.  Got the compy parental units sent. Unfortunately, the keyboard input thingy got squished. Minako finagled me a new keyboard. So, compy's all set up, but for some inexplicable reason, it will not allow itself to read cds. And, Sabrina the Teenage Witch is taking up a signifigant amount of space, and it won't let me delete it. Or even run it, for that matter.  No more news for you. Come back one year.

      Been working. I suck at it. But before you tell me about my low self esteem, let me state why. In roughly ten days, I did thirty batches, and thoroughly enjoyed doing them. However, my concern for quality of work took the back burner, and it became a question of how much I could do. Since the job largely depends on people not making mistakes, this was an inordinately bad idea.   The peculiar thing was that i wasn't actually aware of my motivations, until i took a couple of days off, at Kurt's insistance. I knew I was worried about bills, but i was also had the notion that learning from my mistakes was the best way to go about it. It really isn't. Heaped on top of this was a fabulous inabilty to concentrate, remember, and process what i've been instructed to correct.  So I got this email telling me I was taken off the project. It went on to ask me about the manual - (the manual that I largely ignored because i figured i had to know everything..) whether or not it was clear enough. My reply:  Hi   I think the coding manual is pretty clear. It's me that's having the problems. Basically, I'm in a bad financial situation, and I've been blowing through these batches too fast. Also, I have trouble remembering things, and i have been going about coding the wrong way - I've not looked at the manual as much as i should have, believing that my mistakes will be my teachers. Clearly this is inadquate.   I realised today that in additon to my own failing; the ipro program is not letting me read the QCers notes completely. The arrow key to let me look at all the comments is greyed out, and entirely innaccessible. Basically, I'm only getting roughly one sentance of corrections, consequently missing half the instructions.   I did realise, though, that i ought to be much more careful, and be more diligent. Thanks for the concern, and I am truly sorry for driving you and all the other QCers mental. I am going to make sure I go through the batches slower, and refer to the manual much more often.   I was going to put in there somewhere that I didn't mean to excuse myself, but rather to give supporting reasons for my thickheadedness, but decided not to because of the that a statement like that can prove its own falseness. Again, here i am with fear being my major motivation. Sigh.   In additon to this little drama that played out in the wee hours of last night/this morning, I also went to see the doctor for advisement earlier that day. Lately, I've been immensely frustrated, upset, and, of course, tired and sore. Crying every day, slipping back into isolationist habits, and feeling entirely whacked out. Different from the lethargy of depression, but no less scary. She advised me to increase the nighttime pill, walk every evening, and make sure Kurt gives me backrubs. Sound advice, I think.   Have you noticed the horrible common thread in this post?  Fear is NOT something to base your actions on. If your in physical danger, or in an emergency, fear can kill you, although it does give you that extra energy so you can run away faster, or hit harder.  In the everyday world of making decisions, working, and other common, every day things, it's the touch of death. A wise man once said that 'Fear is to the Devil what Faith is to God'. I think no matter your thoughts on religion, that the statement in essence is true; let fear motivate you, and you're setting yourself up for bad decisions made, stupid mistakes, and carelessness, because you are stuck in 'fight of flight' mode.   In the spirit of last post, more demented links for you are on their way. Enjoy this one. Keep in mind that i'm not going to post any gross, overly explicit stuff without warning you.    urlLink Flying viking kittens would like to take you somewhere

      Nightmares of the unscary but disturbing kind are permeating my brain. So far, my babies have been ripped apart by cats, was forced to murder and torture children and people, had sex with a number of girls i can't stand, everything was violent, and, do i need to state that I've not been sleeping well?  Work has been happening, thank god. Things have been working ok. Expecting a "SaveRobyn" package from my parentals in the next little bit, stuff with canned goods, and more importantly, sweet, sweet chocolate.   I have heard news that the 24hrPartyPeople are moving out, soon. Someone quiet want to move in? Lemme know. The thing about them moving out in mere days has an interesting effect; instead of relaxing, and not complaining about them, I now want to trash their place, and urinate on their carpets. Ok, not exactly, but my active dislike of them has slid into loathing. It's not that i want them dead, it's just that i don't want them alive anymore.

      Step One - get the computer and accesorries. Step Two - get desk Step Three: profit.   Ok, not that simple, but i got the desk, got compy working, got router working, got Kurt's login working,(all with stunning expertise help) and so, here we are, ready and willing to work. Now, all we need is the Company to get lots and lots of work for us to do. Next cheque is a whopping 200 dollars. Fuck, I'm compelled to say, fuck indeed. However, The Powers That Be are keeping more in contact, so i have little to worry about the next little bit. It's nice to know when and when not a person will have work.  News: Nada, zip, zilch, the big goose egg. Go see doctor. Do work. All uninteresting, which is entirely more preferable than interesting. Just ask minako.

      Oh boy, did i find the fun, baby. I'm feeling better, hung out with CGB and his new feline friend, who was apparently abandoned, but in seemingly perfect health. Still waiting for my desk. Desk delivery guy is either really late, or decided to drive the van to mexico. Been a relatively nice non eventful day. Well, mostly...  Flux (This is me on messenger) says:  guess where i go on the 17 of may? 3 guesses  Gimpy says: cape breton  Flux says: nope Gimpy says: Halifax?  Flux says: noooooooooooooooooooooooope  Gimpy says: doctor?  Flux says: come on...that doesn't even count as a guess...i always go to the doctor  Gimpy says: antigonish?  Flux says: nope.  Gimpy says: then tell me damn it  Flux says: to court!  Flux says: i just got subpoenaed  Gimpy says: for what?  Flux says: drunk driver last summer.  Gimpy says: oh yeha  Oh, ye-haw is right, kids. You can read about said event  urlLink here , back in the mists of time. I'm thinking that i may not remember enough but, handily a copy of my statement was with the subpoena; so i can study. My thoughts when reading it was "Wow, this guy's handwriting is TERRIBLE." and, "If I speak like this, I should never talk again." Kinda, like, totally, yeah. Fuck. My mouth should be washed out with soap any time i say those words. I sound like I've had a pre-frontal lobotomy.   Anyways.   No work for the weekend, which would be, totally cool, but yeah, i kinda have no money to like, pay my rent. Poopy. The geeks at work have assured me that monday evening we should be swimming in it. All righty. Time to work those tail feathers. Kurt's going to finally start working for them as well as get a part time job. Maybe, just maybe, we'll get on top of things.  Or, just as likely, not, and have fun flipping around and around the poverty line. Mmmmm, loopy goodness.

      My brain's all mushy.  And today should have been awesome, but it wasn't. I was too tired, and there was too much work to catch up on,(never going to happen), and i felt all weird and whine whine whinerooo whiney whiney whine whine. Thanks for dinner, Granger, sorry i was so poopy.  Right now, I'm at an impass (Is there an "E" at the end of that, or what?) My brain hurts, I'm real tired. But, this project I'm working on ends tonight/early this morning, and the next one pays less than 20 cents a document. Hopefully it'll be zippy-quick. Actually, let's revise that; I hope I will be zippy-quick.  I am just never satisfied.   Before:  Not Sleeping = Whine. After: Lotta Sleep =Whine.  Before: No work = Whine. After: Lotta Work = Whine.  I have reasons, I think. (They could be rationalizations.) The lotta sleep isn't improving my over all well being, and well, 16 hours or so seems excessive. Try as i might to get up after 9 or 10 hours, I'm on the verge of collapse. The lotta work is crammed into one frigging day, a day which relates to my first excessive-sleep problem.   And another thing that gets my proverbial goat; in order to walk up the hill, i need a break. Today, I met a dog and two beautiful young lasses who wore rubber boots and tried hard to trash their tricycle on my walking break. It also took me more than 30 minutes to accomplish said walk. I'm pretty sure the distance was less than a kilometer. AAAAaaaaaGGggggHHHHH!!!!!!! I wasn't wheezy, or out-of-shape feeling, I was just sore. Every step seemed equal to a beating with a heavy stick.  I'm going to go and crawl back under my rock now.

      I'm now experiencing the feast part of my sleep cycle. Although there were intermittent interruptions, yesterday i woke up at two, went back to sleep at five, woke up at one, woke up at three, and here i am now at 8.30am. The day before was similar. I think the the fibro pills are the culprit; see i figure it's pointless to go through the feast if it doesn't make me any more energetic. I'd just as soon get four, since i feel pretty much the same anyways.

      Welcome to the land of physical and financial distress!!!  Yugga. No work for me today, at least not yet. I knew that the job isn't always consistant with work, but i didn't expect to not work for a week, after not being able to work much for two. It's more pissy timing rather than the company's fault, though. If i had a better pay this week, i wouldn't be whining. Also, when they say 'rush project' i really should just stay in the house and code it right away, instead of waiting til the next. I was feeling semi-ok yesterday, so i did errands, then went to bed really early to get a good start on the project today, and, well, damn, i was too slow, and it was already coded. Bloody hell.  Kurt is finished his term, and his year, and there is much rejoicing. Now, i expect the weather to co-operate, and give me summer promptly. None of this shilly-shallying between seasons. I want heat, and sun, and i want it now.  pet peeves (listed in no particular order):  1) doing dishes 2) pop-up ads 3) misuse of certain words, namely the word 'unique' 4) the sound of the fridge in this apartment 5) commercials. those damn things are at the movies.  I'm  sure there are more. Now, to offset, here are a few of my favorite things:  1) Kool-Aid, particularily the blue stuff 2) the woods 3) Beaches 4) chili lights 5) animals  Speaking of animals, Kurt and i were at the pet shop looking at beasts, and picking up a knuckle of some kind of creature that Lucas appreciates greatly. While there, i was looking at a pair of gigantic rats - siamese rats, evidently. The man of the store came over, and took one out for me.   Now, rodents don't freak me out, but their orange teeth scare me, and i haven't seriously ever thought of picking one up. I'm glad the guy handed one over to me, because i fell in love. This little creature snuffled happily in my ear, sat on my shoulder, and reached out her little hands to touch my face. It was improbably friendly, and affectionate, and smart, as well. Amazing. The rat was soft, and liked to be stroked, and well, I've always found rat's tails to be asthetically unappealing, but the tail felt really nice too. I'd love to get one, but i do worry that phoebe is a little to feral to accept a rat as part of the family. I suppose i'm going to have to do some research on the subject, just in case. Kurt wants to get one, and name it Scabbers, of course.

      Right, so i skipped a couple of days. You didn't miss much, save for Blinding Pain!!! Ugh. I think that when i become totally immobile, it has something to do with the weather. Pressure changes, or mositure changes, i don't know, but now I'm seriously thinking of places i can move to which have very sedate weather. Ideas?  Besides the Blinding Pain, I have done much at all. I was in bed, feeling sorry for myself and occasionally lamenting that ginger ale doesn't seem to cut it for curing all my ailments anymore. And I'm back to unsleeping, it's all about napping sporadically.  So today, let me tell you a story. It's working title is Lucas and The Fat Kid. Most of you probably know it, but I'm telling you to shut up and deal.  I was living in Cowtown, at my asshole uncle's place. The timeframe was the Beginning of Suicidal Summer. Not a particularily great time on my list. But this was slightly before the shit hit the proverbial fan. I was doing my turtle thing, I didn't know anyone in the city, I didn't want to meet anyone, and i shunned most human contact. Most days I sat in the back yard or my room, and read. Occasionally i planted things, and painted other things. I took Lucas for walks, we hung out the the backyard together.   It was before school was out for the kiddies. I used to watch them walk up from the bottom of my road in my turtle way. There was this one kid who was my next door neighbour. He was twelve years old said my mom, his parents came from jamaica said my asshole uncle, and I said 'That is one fat kid.' It was his discerning characteristic. He was tall, and he was fat. More fat than tall though. His parents were friendly, he was shy, and quite often my family would hear exchanges between his family, although there was a bit of lawn and, well, walls to go through. They weren't mean folks, I'm positive they were nice to their son, The Fat Kid, but merely were outstandingly loud in their verbosity. The fat kid, as far as we could tell, didn't talk much, or, seemingly at all.  Despite his long legs, he'd always be dead last shuffling up the hill. His jacket hung off one shoulder, he skuffed his feet when he walked. I feel the need to say at this point that he was NOT pathetic, or sad, or even lonely; it just seemed that while other kids were perhaps marching to different drummers, he might still be looking for his.  It was May, and i was sitting under a few trees, reading either 'Mere Christianity' or some book by his holiness, the Dalai Lama. Lucas had dug himself a little spot in the yard, and he was happily basking in the sunlight. Through the slats in the high fence dividing my asshole uncle's yard from the Jamaicans the fat kid had spotted Lucas. He started calling to the The Prince of Dogdom in the most melodic voice i had ever heard; 'Heeeeeeere, Doggie Doggie Doggie....' He'd wait a minute or two and call again. He got Lucas' attention, but he wasn't about to trot over to the neighbour's yard. When we first moved to the City, Lucas and i had a long talk about how going into other peoples' spaces was not a good idea, and neither was wandering the roads. He's good about obeying instructions. Lucas instead of walking over to the Fat Kid, came across the yard from where i was sitting in the shade. We discussed the various benefits and detriments of going over to vist the Fat Kid, and we agreed that when the Kid calls, Lucas was more than welcome to keep him company. So, Lucas walked back to where he was seen by the kid, and he waggled at him. (Lucas has a very fetching waggle). The Fat Kid exclaimed happiness at seeing Lucas again, and Lucas waggled even more. When the kid called Lucas again, he gave me a wink, and off he trotted.   He spent many an afternoon that summer at the Fat Kid's place. I spied a bit, and Lucas would be buried beneath adulation. The kid had the biggest, whitest grin, and he sang songs to lucas, all afternoon long, while stoking and petting Lucas, and feeding him leftovers. (I'm pretty sure the Fat Kid's mom was not so impressed with this.) The songs were always a tune made up by the kid, and floated gently across the summer days. Hours and hours they would sit together like that. Even now, if you were to sing, in a melodious voice 'here, doggie doggie' Lucas would have a special waggle for you. He misses the Fat Kid, and i bet when he dreams sometimes, he hears the tuneless singing, and feels the love that fat kid has for him.   If i could go back in time, I would have loved to meet the fat kid. His kindness, and love for my dog, and his sedate way of shuffling up the street is etched on my memory. If i could go back in time, I'd tell the kid Lucas' name and the stories about him. I would have helped him convince his parents to let him have dog of his own, and Lucas could teach that puppy the secret ways Lucas has. I'd let the kid know that Lucas loves him as much as he loves Lucas, and no matter where i go in this life, I will be grateful for his kindess, and his singing that made him happy, and made me happy.  I would have learned his name, too.    It is the little things that break a person down, but it seems to me that the little things can help a person up, too. I miss that kid, and his singing, and his soft voice while he said nice things to the dog. And I really hope good things are happening to him and for him.  on a completely different note: Granger, I was not on the computer yesterday, and I completely, utterly and totally forgot about your drumming dealio. I'm sorry.

      Must stay awake...  I managed not to sleep the afternoon away - however, it was more of a matter of couldn't rather that force of will. Didn't sleep last night, either, and the amount of non-work that's been happening might be a major factor. I don't think I've done anything since friday of last week. I think various anxieties would have been cut down greatly if i were being useful, and that the current pay check coming in wasn't going to suck, and, well, hell. Finances - the bane of my existance.   I have a problem. I dye my hair all the frigging time. I think i'd like to see the original color before my head turns all gray. Thing is, I haven't been able to handle just letting my hair grow out. So, the plan goeth thusly: clown hair. I'm going to get streaks of punkish hair happening, so that why, when the hair gets growing out, i will let it, because i won't want to color over my lovely, lovely streaks. An elaborate plan? Yes. Necessary? If i want to see my old hair again. I'm a bit weird about my hair. Every once and a while, i have to either cut it or dye it, and it's a hard urge to resist.   This superfical post brought to you by fatigue. Good night.

      I'm on the wrong side of the day now. It's very disorienting to get up when the sun goes down, but on the plus side, I've been staying up till about noon, so it's just that meddlesome afternoon bit I've dispensed with. Besides, it rained all day today, or at the least, was wet. And it's going to be like that for the rest of the week. Who needs it?  Kurt's got one paper left and three more exams; then second year becomes a memory. Ran into my old academic advisor yesterday evening, and it seems to me that he may put me in a burlap sack and beat me with reeds if I don't finish my B.A. It seems really simple for everyone else save for me about that. It's a money thing. One of my courses is tied up with another school, and won't be released until i pay them 600. Added to this is either paying off all the interest that has accrued with my student loan, or paying for a course up front, which comes out to be 1200 dollars, more or less. Probably more. I just can't seem to pull that sum out of my ass. But, if things go right the next couple of months, and we manage to put some cash in a hidey hole, well, hey, it'll be done like dinner.  On the other hand, my marks are mostly uncool. If i do get the degree, it isn't particularily giving me any benefit. I'd want to do a masters, and a 2.8 out of 4.0 is not going to get me there. I have a job I'm content with. I consider my time at university gave me the tools i need and want, why should i pick up that pain in the ass elective? Aahh, hell.  Interesting thing about my academic advisor; we've been living in the same community of w/v for two years, and i haven't seen him more than three times in that time frame. This man is amazing, gave me confidence to speak in class, knew about the non-wedding before anyone else, and i consider him to be a good friend and counseller type. He's been away from the university setting this past year, but kept office hours all last. So, why didn't I go visit? Because I am a sucker, that's why. Big old gulliable dumbass idiot person.

      Do you think I ought to write in here every day, despite the lack of goings on and opinions? Kurt pointed out to me yesterday that I don't write on here every day, and when i first started the blog, I did. Neither of us could rightly figure out why that had happened. I had originally started this to write about the fallout associated with drug addiction, and the sometimes idiotic struggles i have with being a headcase.   Ok, I'm starting to think I know why. You know all of this now. If I'm having an off day, it's one of the virtual hundreds that have been posted already. I think my set of mind is telling me to quit boring the nice people with petty stuff about me that's been said a million times.   I also feel like i have no opinons - Kurt's the guy for that, really. I don't have any shocking and interesting rants like the Misanthropic Bitch (look her up on google - great writer, very angry, and possibly full of shit.)  Hmm. Here are a list of opinons.   1) People suck. I just wrote a big long paragraph on the subject, and deleted it because it can be summed up simply. Too many people do not give a shit.  2) All advertising is a form of pornography.  3) The medical profession knows nothing about disease.  4) The way society is set up, with the working and paying of bills, and educating oneself, there's almost impossible to escape debt, and They want to keep as many people as possible there.  5) Reckless drivers should either be shot in the knee. Or the balls, I'm not sure which.   6) The odds are stacked heavily against single mothers.  7) Racism and sexism are still large and in control.  8) TV slowly eats away at your brain.  9) There are a lot of people who need to sit down, and shut the fuck up.  10) Most, if not all of the problems with our mendacious little planet relate to my first opinon; too many people do not give a shit.   And despite all of these negativities, the world is a beautiful, wonderful and utterly amazing place. There are people that do give a shit, like the guy who found out the guitar he bought was once stolen in 1966. He returned it to the owner. There's the boys who bandaged me up, and took care of me when i passed out looking for Lucas. (low blood sugar+low blood pressure+sudden injury like jamming my finger in a door, or spraining my ankle=unconcious person.) The people that search for survivors in the rubble. Mother Theresa (She's a statement, all by herself). People who say after doing something heroic 'It had to be done and I'm sure that anyone would have done the same thing in my place'. People like my parents who take people in when they need a place to stay. Volunteers. People like Sarah, who didn't know me well at all, and gave me a job.  Oh yeah, for the curious, Bassiedoc did use the word "cured". I think, more than anything else, she used that particular word to demonstrate to me that she was extremely confident in my recovery, and that she doesn't think I'll relapse again. It was comforting, but i think it's still bullshit. Maybe in five years or so I'll buy it.  Sexy yellow dog, you shed over all things; cause miasmas of fur.

      I got this scam, er, e-mail in my ol' hotmail box the other day. It goes as follows. The crappy editing and the misspelled words are not going to be fixed, i must share all my joy with you. THe subject was "Let's Talk On Messenger". I want to talk to this fella, i really do. Kurt figures even talking to the person is a large security risk, and so, I'm going to bow to my sissy husband's wishes and leave all my asshole questions in my head. Sigh. Anyways, here is this piece of comedy:  Attn. GENDER From:Barr: GABRIEL ARO , (Gabito Chambers and Solicitor) 59 Rue Boulevard Djankasse, B.P.50214, Lome-Togo. As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through the business directory at chamber of commerce and Industry here in Lome-Togo, where I was searching for a good reliable contact which I will entrust this business oppurtunity into its control, I was elated when I saw your address,and I picked a keen interest with confidence to solicit for your help in executing this oppurtunity.However,I was moved to contact you base on the present situation of this oppurtunity which I may say that it is God given time offer, their is a foreigner who lived here in Lome-Togo long ago called Arthur Billings by name,and it happened that the man registered to me as his private personal attorney,unfortunately the man died with his wife and their two kids in plain crash which happened on 30th October, 1999. Owing to the death of this man called Arthur Billings by name,his bank called on me for his balance with the bank as his attorney since January 2000,to invite his relatives to come and claim the money,I tried all I could to trace his family,but all my efforts proved arbortive,then from october last year 2003,till now,the bank has been pressurising me to look for his family because they realise that a lot of swindlers have been forwarding application to claim the money as his next of kin,but it happen that after much verification,they will find out that those people were rogues,because they cannot provide a legal evidence to prove that they were his bonafide relatives. Moreover,I have decided to use you as his next of kin to claim the money for my own personal use as it happen that his relatives were not available up till now,and I have all his documented memo in my file which will back you up before the bank as his next of kin,I will still obtain a genuine legal evidence which I will do with your name to certify that you are the rightful next of kin to the deceased. Furthermore,the amount involved is ($8 000.,000.00) EIGHT MILLION United State Dollars,therefore I will like you to furnish me with your full name and address , which I will use to secure the legal documents,as soon as I receive your address,I will form an application which you will submit to the concerned bank as his next of kin.Be rest assured that their is no risk involved as I have perfected and made the neccessary arrangements to back you up in claiming the fund. Finally,you have to maintain the high secret this business demands as the bank does not know that I am using you to claim the money on my own,besides,I will compensate you with 25% of the total money for your help and assistance,and I will like to invest my own part of the money in your country base on your advice.Therefore you can now forward the address and your full name,and I will furnish you with the application as soon as you reply this mail. Thanks as I await for your reply. Best Regards, BARR.GABRIEL ARO.   It's a little hard to follow, eh? If you didn't get all the way through, i fully understand. Here's the sum up. Guy will give me 25% of eight million if i lie and tell the authorites I'm a dead person's long lost relative. The question I'd ask him would be first and foremost how he got my email address. I'm relatively low on spam, and yeah, I'm curious. How many people actually fall for this sort of mess, i wonder?  Heh. Wouldn't it be funny if i was the guy's long lost relative for real? There's a stupid short story in there, i know it.  Kurt's been all student-y and doing lots of work the past while, so I've not had much of a chance to work. I cringe to think what this paycheck will be. I'm seeing getting caught up with the bills a more distant goal than it was. Eh. Well, I'm not dead, anyhow.   Speaking of which, Bassiedoc tells me I'm 'cured' - I'm not depressed any more. Of course, I still have to take my crazy pills and meet with her, allbeit every three weeks instead of every week or two. I keep on thinking that a person who sees me for an hour for a period of a couple months is probably not the best person to be assesing my day-to-day mood. Sure, I do feel better. But the moment I think I've got this beat, I have a tendancy to end up in the emergency room, trying desperately to push up daisies. It's good to hope. But I think it's too big a risk to put all my marbles in Bassiedoc's basket - I have heard this before.  As for knitting - fuck the backstitch right in the ear. I'm terrible at it.  Maybe the one needle loopy thing is simpler. That, or bite the bullet, and take lessons from someone extremely patient. I've started to write in a hardcover journal again, I hope this means an end to the constipation i've been feeling towards writing. Feast or famine, though, i bet when i do start writing creatively again, it'll be diarhhea. With a spell checker.  Tune in next time for the "people suck" rant. For homework, watch '28 days later'. Yes it is a zombie movie. But it's the best damn zombie movie I've ever seen.

      Welcome to April. It's wet.  Good weekend that just passed by, spent it with SD, CBG, and a pal from the Olden University Dayes - HiccupyW. We haven't hung out in years, it was damn good. There were very late nights, non existant mornings, and a lot of talking.  Work is going ok, not doing as much as i feel i should, but Kurt's at his end of term madness, so computer time is limited. Bills are...well, bills. Car is caught up, but that's it. Rent is a wee bit behind, other bills, as behind as they usually are. Poo.   That's it for now.  Thanks for your computer prowess, Mr. Flakes.

      We discovered just before the western conference in hockey that we get two channels - CTV and CBC. On the rough side it means i have to endure hockey, but on the plus side there's been shows that i like on. For example, 2 weeks ago, I caught "Dial 'M' For Murder"; a play-turned movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Cool. Then, I realised that "Law and Order" happens on one of those channels, "Wayne & Shuster" was on the other night, and there's this new show on, and i think i may love it. It's called "Cold Case" and i was going to link to the blurb, but it was written by tards. Basically, you got a detective, goes back to the old files, and, well hopefully solves them. Fine, that tells you NOTHING. The sad thing is, i can't tell you much more than that. It's funny, and smartly written, and i can't beleive i'm raving about something on TV but there you go. Amazing. I only saw the one episode, so i can say nothing about it as a whole, but if the episode i saw was any indication, it's phenomenal, and sure to get cancelled.  And i have to say, since i mentioned TV, that I just don't give a fuck about hockey.   It's still raining in W/V, and it's supposed to keep on raining until thursday. And it's cold, so this nice horrid damp pain feeling has permeated my very bones,and makes me feel as though i'll never be warm again. Or in any less pain. I'm still not taking my meds, and i'm thinking hard indeed about going back to them. I remember an article about a woman who had this and how the wind would hurt her. I thought that was insane. I'm at the place now, though, where jeans, or a touch from Kurt is pretty painful. I noticed this morning that where ever my body touched a surface it hurt - so, lying in bed is fairly excruciating; in a chair less so; and i think the problem could be solved by living my life immersed in warm water. Since that's not an option, (not yet, anyways) i think perhaps being good and being treated might be the way to go.   Of course, being good involves going back to the doctor...

      We're moving to a new apartment. It's on the same property as the one we're in; but with one less room, and what looks like wooden shingles on one of the walls. The kitchen and the living room are one longish room, in order to reach the bathroom, the wilds of the bedroom must be traversed. It's 100 dollars cheaper, a royal pain in the ass practically, and there's not much choice in the matter. It's a nice place, though - seems like it is better maintained than the one we're in currently. Might be newer, or some such.  I'm not feeling anything much about it. There is a lot of sentimentality attached to where we're at. We fostered kitties there. Cordy died in the living room. Our first apartment. Got to move out sooner or later, though. Besides, it has come to my attention that i have a morbid attachment to places, people and things.  The funk's still funk, with no sign of the good George Clinton anywhere. I hope it's the weather.

      Today is a day for wallowing. Abstract thought, sadness, worries, sickness, fatigue - all of these things mix together to create this perfect bit of mud that i can crawl into and cover up in.   I'm not getting along with my mom. I'm not paying my bills. I'm not writing a book.I'm not being productive. I'm not interested in hanging out with friends. I'm not resting. I'm not doing any Good in the World. I'm not being useful. I'm not being supportive. I'm not being a particularily good friend. I'm not thinking very well. I'm not planning my future, budget, or to do anything. I'm not doing anything even remotely enjoyable. I'm just sitting here, waiting for it to be late enough for me to fall asleep, and feeling slightly guilty for not finishing off the dishes.

      Ok, so, i want a family. Couple kids, boatloads of animals, yee haw, and all. But man, I just don't think I'm physically capable.   Been taking on the care of Seth the wonder toddler. Great kid. We're talking easy going, virtually a self-entertaining unit, good mobility and communication skills, and a all-around beauty baby.   But, he's heavy, and he smears food all over himself and anything close by, has the 2nd Most Grossest Poops Ever, and well, he's a toddler. Tie him up to a mad-scientist's energy device, and he could be the source of all of Hong Kong's electricity. Typical kid.   But i was thinking tonight, as i changed his shitty ass, that i just might not have it into me to go through night feedings, teething, bumps and bruises,and all the other assorted stuff that i don't even KNOW about because i am not a mom. Kurt and i are talking ankle biters in four years, hopefully sooner, and, well, holy hell, I think it's got to be later. God. Mama said something off handedly tonight about 'when Seth was going through his sleep-for-two-hours-only period'. Picture that when your husband has to maintain his GPA, and you, well you need twelve hours sleep just to pick the infant up. Ye gods!  My heartfelt respect goes to ever mom and pop out there who's raising one of those weird little creatures. May your supply of caffeine and valium never run out.  No work since monday. I'm doing the babysitting thing a few nights a week, but I'm starting to lose more and more faith in the 'full time job'. I knew it was not going to be steady work. I was ok with that. But it's been positively wretched since easter, no contact back from the head guy over at the ongoing project, and i feel left in bloody limbo again. I've got no choice now - I've got to call these people and ask them, politely to get me, and everyone else enough work to buy groceries, or pay rent, or something along those lines.  Met a cool girl down the Farmer's Market today, 18, did some home school stuff, nice as pie, and i think i may of did that whole spray-whilst-you-talk thing. You know, when your saliva jumps out, in a fine spray, upon another person? Yeah, that's me baby, although i think a stiff breeze might have spared the chickie poo from the spit shower. It's weird. Sometimes, I do all right in crowds. Never at first, but eventually i can come to a state where i can deal, speak coherently, and sometimes, just sometimes, I'm able to construct entire sentences. Today though, hoo boy wow. My brain could have been on mars, or maybe uranus.  Anyways, the girl, who will be known henceforth as Mermaid, for no apparent reason, is going to be my new knitting pal, and another avid movie watcher, who enjoys culinary delights. Sweet, I say. Survey question: At what point do you cut off friend potentials because of age differences?  Finished reading the Sillmarilleillilllllllllion, and despite coming off like a textbook, having a googol of names that all read similarilillllly, there were some great stories in there. Great stories. And it had the effect of adding another layer to Middle-Earth, the legend, and well, everything about "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings". I even re-read a few bits, and promptly jumped in to yet another slow and stately reading of the latter. You know, "The Hobbit" followed by the next three were the first set of novels i ever read, followed by "The Chronicles of Narnia". And I had two huge fairy tale books, the "Complete Brothers Grimm", and this beautiful book of fairy tales from around the world. The latter is sitting in storage, in a cabin somewhere. I hope one day to find it again.   I come by being a dork honestly, eh? Don't even get me stared on mythology...  I got to go and read up on getting pet insurance now. Or sleep. Or read. Or dress and drag, and do the hula. Luau!

      I should have known it was going to be a peculiar sort of day when I called CBG at quarter to nine in the MORNING, and he was awake. Not only was he awake, but i was awake, and Kurt was awake. So, we went to lunch. Before lunch, though, we wandered around downtown w/v, and found Dr. Tiggy Jones, Esq. in kitty jail.  Jones showed up at Moak's (aka CBG - i hate that pseudonom) place, and let him know that he was a proud cat owner. Jones, being cold, skinny and shivery was given a layman's exam by me, and he was duly fooded and watered. Jones pulled a littlest hobo, however, ran ran off into the Blue without even his pocket hankie, and Moak was left catless. Until today, that is. I make habit of visiting kitties in the shelter, and whislt kurt and moak were doing pre-lunch book window shopping, I was over smelling the cat pee, and feeling the love. One cat looked familar, and acted familar, and it promptly left my head. Moak and Kurt came in to fetch me, and Moak addresses Jones, and told him he was stupid. He decided to spring Jones (aka Tiggy to the good folks at the w/v animal hospital) from kitty jail after lunch.   We're walking on main, and we see a CBC van with all the trimmings, and two cameras, and a well-seen news anchor who wanted our thoughts on the upcoming election. (There is an election? Oh, please ask me my extremely educated opinon) I may or may not be seen on national tv with my hawaiian shirt on. Classy. Kurt and Moak said some reasonably intelligent things, i burbled at bit, then it really really was off to lunch, and errands, and the end of certain oddity. Rounded off the afternoon and evening with Seth the wonder toddler, watched him smear food substances everywhere conceiveable, laughed and watched cartoons while crashing trucks. A good day, by all accounts.  Now to fearlessly quash the evil of Gargerensis.

      So, I didn't have to testify the other day; the drunken driver changed his plea the day of the trial. I've heard that this is a common practice - that way the driver can eke out a year or so of driving before the trial. Assmonkey.  Been busy experiencing life as a person with mono - lots of sleep, no rest, and permanently tired. My dreams center around christmas in the summer time. And toothbrushes. I've been dreaming a lot about toothbrushes lately.  No real newness. Later for you.

      An amendment to the death penalty claim - I remember the stat. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name or the pertinent people in said study. So,I offically retract the 80% until i find it. If anyone has any clues, let me know, eh? Background on the study was a bunch of lawyer types started snooping in old, solved cases that ended up with an excution. They discoverd that 80% of those excutions had serious, mind-blowing errors in them, and the executed shouldn't have been. It was done this or last year. Anyways, here's a link and a blurb of what I did find.    “Since 1973, approximately 6,000 people have been sentenced to death.53 During this same period, 69 people have been released from death row with substantial evidence of their innocence. This translates to a rate of over 1 innocent death row inmate for every 100 death sentences. As the analysis above indicates, the rate may be considerably higher, since extraordinary efforts are generally needed to free a death row inmate, and most inmates do not have those extra resources available to them.”  – study/report 1997  Go  urlLink here  to get it that and a veritable wealth of depressing knowledge about the death penalty. The first thing i found shocking and pretty damn scary is 38 out 50 states allow it. The second - You wouldn't believe the stats involving race and excution.   That reminds me. Go  urlLink here.  It's important. For those of you too lazy; three boys have been convicted of savagely murdering three littler boys. There's one problem, though. The boys incarcerated are innocent. Please read it.  And i got nothing else at the moment. Next post will consist of sarcasm, trifles, and be exempt from any propaganda from me. No ISSUES, guarenteed!

       The following is a bunch of topics with thoughts on said topics. For the purpose of this article, we’re going to assume a ‘good or bad’ sort of scheme with it. A little background: Both commentators are white, male, mid-twenties. One’s a Christian, the other, a Gonzo. (Read: a Whatever.) Both guys are my friends, and I’ve asked permission to reproduce this material. They both asked me for my comments on the subjects below, and here it is, along with answer ratings and snarky comments. Your snarky comments are more than welcome in the comments section.       Abortion – Poo: If women really want to have control over their own bodies, they should have enough control to keep their legs closed, or just accept the consequences. 	      Duck: Damned straight! If you don't want kids, flush em. They're nothing more than parasitic nodes of flesh anyway. I hear people say things like 'they have a right to live too!' and bullshit like that, For fucks sakes, you dicksnacks, embryos are no more than lumps of pudge until they breath on their own, and are fully separate from the mother's body. Until then, she can do with them as she sees fit. It's just pre-emptive euthanasia. So get over it, it's not like you were aborted, and you should have been, so shut up and be grateful you dodged that bullet.  ME – Poo’s answer is bullshit. He’s not taking into account rape, whether it would be violent or coercion. Speaking of coercion, there is a lot going on. Boys need to be taught that it’s downright fucking evil to trick, beg, force, or whatever to get a girl to sleep with them. One could say that Poo’s answer is pretty sexist, considering the non-consequences a male has to go through in this situation. Also, he’s not directly commenting on the issue, just the crap around it. He gets a rating of F, for Flame on, readers! Duck’s answer is an answer, despite the smatterings of ad hominums. His rating is a D+. My answer: Abortion is shitty, and for me there is no satisfactory yes or no answer. The one point that I can really stand behind is that it should not, under any circumstances, be illegal. The illegality of abortion would simply cause a lot of women to die. History on the subject relates horrific and painful deaths because women went to back alley clinics or tried to get rid of the baby themselves. Would I get one? I doubt it. And I don’t think it’s a good idea. But it should never be illegal.   Death Penalty – Poo: If it was up to me, i wouldn't allow the death penalty anywhere, but then again, i'd do everything i could to make serious offenders pay for the expenses they incur. 		     Duck: You kill, you die. It's just that simple. If you choose to take another person's life, when they pose no threat to you and have no chance to defend themselves, then you are a coward and you deserve to die.  Me: Both guys give a satisfactory answer. Their ratings are A. My answer is a negatory for the death penalty. There are too many variables. If you do a google on studies of the death penalties in the states, you will find that a little over 80% of executions are carried out on innocent people. That’s pretty damn unacceptable. Also, I think a person ought to think about the executioner and the society that condones execution. Basically, execution is state-sanctioned murder, and in the process of eliminating one murderer, you’re creating another. Two wrongs do not make a right.  Prostitution - Poo: How can you justify sleeping with a woman you've only just met? and degrading one of God's greatest gifts to humanity by paying for it?                          Duck: I think that it should be legalized and regulated by the government. That way, all the negative effects of the practice will be moderated if not removed completely. As for the morality of the act, what difference does it make. If the partners are consensual, then have fun folks. Just be safe.  Me – I like Poo’s way of taking the viewpoint of the john, but at the same time it makes his answer weaker because this is something that needs examination on both sides.  B+ for both, because Duck did the same thing in reverse. My answer is a big NO to prostitution. However, the world as we know it does suck, and it’s going to be there unless some major and possibly inconceivable changes are made in society. I’m with the duck on this one – it does need to be regulated, I think, to move pimps out of their positions of power over these women. Also, with regulation there’d be medical help to be given where needed, and policing measures over illegal operations. Not the best solution, but we’re not in the best sort of place here.   Alcohol - Poo: Take responsibility for your actions. If you can't handle it, don't do it.                 Duck: Alcohol itself? Or the practice of being drunk? In and of itself, there is nothing inherently evil with alcohol. Just have the willpower to be responsible. I like being drunk with my friends, but if I am, it's at home, where I don't have to drive anywhere, and it's when I have nothing that I need to do the next day. Be smart, idiots. Me- Good answers, fellas. A for you. My answer is that alcohol probably isn’t a good thing. It’s just about the most useless drug there is, causing aaaaaaaaallll sorts of problems all over the place. However, it does seem that the alcohol brings out problems that are there already, so I’d have to say that drinking itself isn’t a problem, it’s how it’s used.   Marijuana - Poo: I don't like anything that takes away one's control over their own body. Hmm.. guess that includes alcohol. dang.                      Duck: I personally see no problem with it, provided you don't become dependant on it. Just don't do it around me, as I can't handle the smell. Me – Poo flakes out here, so gets a C-. Get off the fence, kiddo. Duck’s answer is okie doke, A for him. My answer is that I hate drugs, but I do not really understand why I do. Weed’s included in the hatreds of drugs thing. My answer, I suspect, gets an F. Oh, yeah, duck, what’s wrong with dependence? You’re pretty dependant on oxygen, not to mention food, and, er, pranic energy.  Other Drugs – Poo: Same. Or moreso, since a lot of them are even more harmful.                            Duck: Depends on the drug, but the sentiment remains the same. Be smart, don't let it take over, and have the will power to stop. Me – Good answers, but if we’re strict we’d have to dock some points off Poo of his squeamishness earlier. We’re not that strict, though, So A for everyone. My answer is that I still hate drugs. HATE THEM. I think they’re useless, and horrid. I’m coming from a prejudiced place though, I had the benefit of being addicted to prescription drugs. I have no idea why anyone would take any drugs for fucking fun.  Gay marriage – Poo: Civil unions are fine, but why do gay people want to get married in a church, if that church doesn't support, or completely support their union?                             Duck: That is an oxymoron. Gays can't marry. Marriage is a contract taken between a man and a woman and witnessed by God, with His blessing. Marriage is a religious institution, and it should not be taken out of that context. Unless one is truly committing to his/her partner, before God, one should not use the term marriage, not even hetros who get unions. As for the legal aspect, Civil Unions (whether hetro or homo) should not be seen any different than marriage in the eyes of the law.  Me- Some more good answers, and I tend to agree.  A for the boys.  Illegal Immigrants – Poo: It's not like we earned the right to live in this country just by being born in it. I don't want criminals and bums coming here, but Canada isn't ours to keep for ourselves                                   Duck: Kill them. If they don't have the respect for this country to become citizens through the system that is set up for that very purpose, then they do not have the right to be here. And if they don't want to go back, then they should be killed. If Illegals are executed, then they won't be so eager to try to sneak in here.   Me – I think the duck’s gone a bit postal on this one.  He’s ignoring why a lot of folks become illegal immigrants in the first place – there’s not enough time for them go through the process of by-the-book immigration. Most immigrants are in themselves extenuating circumstance, and they’re coming here to get help. The immigration system is also set up here in Canada to be selective. They want men, with education. C+ for you duck, and an A for Poo. As for me, well, it’s not like we don’t have any room here, but I don’t know a lot about what’s going on with the issues therein.   Smoking – Poo: What's the point to it, anyways? spend money, kill yourself slowly, pollute the air, take money away from MY healthcare system; gee, what's the downside?                    Duck: You're stupid, you're ugly, and you're not welcome around me while you smoke. You may be a nice person, but you know better than to smoke and yet you choose to do so anyway. And don't tell me you 'can't' quit. Don't be a pussy.  Me- An A for everybody, and I agree. I hate smoking, it interferes with other people’s well being, and it’s gross.  Drunk Driving – Poo: I think that's basically attempted murder. I'm not sure what the punishment should be, but whatever it is, i'm sure it's not severe enough.                            Duck: If you get caught, you should be charged with attempted murder. Me – Ditto.   Cloning – Poo: If God wanted more than one of you, he would have made more than one of you. And He does that sometimes, with twins, triplets, etc.                 Duck: Hmm. For the purposes of medicine, I see no problem with it. But for the idea of making clone armies or giving yourself a new body to live in, that's just stupid. As for genetic manipulation, which I don't think would be the same thing, go for it. I cannot wait for the day when each generation is designed by the last and are grown in tanks and raised in crèches. Sterilize the populace and only allow procreation through the crèche. That way it can be regulated and would eliminate many problems associated with reproduction. Teenage pregnancy, abortion, adoption; it would all be a thing of the past.  Me- Okie doke on the answers, although at this point I’m wondering if the duck hasn’t been sniffing glue or something. A for the answers, and as for me, I don’t have any real strong feelings on the subject, either way.  Racism – Poo: It seems pointless and stupid to differentiate between groups of people based on their appearance. that's a given, though. I don't think this is really a tough question.                 Duck: A person should be judged on his/her character, not the colour of his/her skin. That is why I have a fundamental disagreeance with affirmative action.  Me- An A for Poo, and a B- for duck – look up the purpose of affirmative action, will you?   Pre-Martial Sex- Poo: I'm not sure if the sex itself is the problem, it's all the crap that happens afterwards. Sex isn't something you get to do casually, it's a special gift from God.                            Duck: Who cares what you do? If it's consensual, then go for it. Just be prepared for the consequences. Be smart and be safe.  Me- No problems with the answers here, A for both. As for me, I think weird shit happens to a lot of people who have sex casually. I don’t exactly approve of it, it’s far too risky. I think that a person should be, at the very least, in a committed relationship.    Religion – Poo: It bugs me that people's inability to understand their own language makes them think that religion is bad. U see the worst examples of religion and think they're all like that                 Duck: Don't get me started. What a crock of shit religion is. It is merely a tool that has been developed by the powers that be for controlling the masses and attempting to instill a sense of goodwill in mankind. If there was really One True God who cared what happened to us, then religion would not have gone through such a wild evolution.  Me- Valid answers, both. A. My answer is that religion is broken, just like everything else. It has its truly awesome and miraculous points, and also its evil and horrid points. I think that religion is too broad a topic for the ‘good or bad’ category, so I’m going to say ‘spoon’, and leave it at that.  The War in Iraq – Poo: everything that Saddam did wrong, has been done just as bad by another country. the war was all about oil. email me for more thoughts.       Duck: Bomb the fuckers, but as a conquering power, treat the conquered with respect, or you sully your victory. No one likes a sore winner.  Me- Both answers are satisfactory, although I can’t help but think that Duck’s missed the point there. A is for answer. My answer is that war is war, and war is hell. War in general is something awful and evil. That goes for this war particularily.  Bush – Poo: I guess he's trying his best. He's not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree. a lot of my thoughts about him are related to the war.              Duck: I love bush. I wish that there was more bush on tv and in the media. Everyone says that sexuality is inappropriate subject matter, but I say to hell with them. Why would we want to make sex more taboo than violence? Oh wait, you mean Bush, as in the President of the USA. Hmm, well, why didn't you say that.  Me- F for Duck, although, hey sweet dodge there, fella. Poo’s is a satisfactory answer, but I feel compelled to comment that ‘not the brightest bulb on the tree’ is a glaring understatement. B-. My answer? At the risk of getting a visit from the secret service, I have to say he must be stopped. Stopped.  Downloading Music- Poo: Music is art, it should be available to the whole world. Everyone needs music, never mind wanting it. just don't resell it.                                   Duck: If you burn a cd and then sell it, you are going to hell. Other than that, go for it. It's not like you aren't buying less cds than you would normally.  Me- Nice answers. An A for all. I agree. The powers that be said the same thing about blank tapes.   The Legal Drinking Age – Poo: Dunno. 18, i guess. or 19. doesn't matter so much, now that i'm past it. i don't think it's a huge problem that our legal age is lower than the U.S.'s.                                           Duck: 18. Until then, your body is still developing (one could argue that it is still even after the age of 18) and regular alcohol use would be detrimental. Plus, hopefully, the majority of people would be mature enough to drink responsibly by then, but there are thousands of drunks who can disprove that point. Me- Ditto for marks and answers, for me I’d have to say that the legal drinking age thing is a load of crap. There really isn’t a need to have it as an offense, save that I’m sure it makes some asshole money somewhere. All the fines do is punish the parents, really, and I think by making it a legal issue it creates more of a problem. If any kid could buy beer, it wouldn’t be a big deal, and there would be no blowout on the 19th birthday, and no sense that it’s a taboo thing, and therefore not another tool for rebellious teens.   Porn- Poo: I'm not sure i can say much about this.. it'd be sort of hypocritical:) but the whole objectifying women, damaging their self esteem, hurting them in any way, pisses me off.            Duck: Love it. Nothing wrong with it, provided that the actors (and I use the term loosely) are aware of what they are doing and choose to do it. If you feel shame for making porn or watching it, then don't, but don't you DARE to condemn those of us who don't have a problem with it. Me: Poo loses points for skirting the issue. Wuss. He gets a D, which might have been a C- if he didn’t stick on that bullshitty crap at the end. I disagree completely with the Duck, but hey, it’s a complete answer, but he adds the crap at the end, so B+. As for me, porn might well be proof that we’re in Babylon. There’s nothing healthy about using people, and when you masturbate to an airbrushed girl who probably wouldn’t have gotten her fake tits if it weren’t for you and other losers like you whacking off, that’s exactly what you’re doing. That person in the photograph isn’t a person anymore, she is a means to your breathy, sticky end. I think there’s nothing wrong with masturbation, alone or with a friend. There is something distinctly wrong with the useage of porn.  Not only does it do no justice to women, It makes the guys have a sense of acceptance that’s completely false – those girls wouldn’t piss on your gums if your teeth were on fire. They don’t want to fuck you, they do not want to suck your dick, they do not want to be penetrated by your manhood. Using a porn is a reflection of something missing in your life, whether it’s acceptance from your girl, or rejection, or whatever. Re-enforcing these negativities is harmful to the porn consumer, and that’s all porn can  ever offer.     Suicide – Poo: Life is one of the greatest gifts God gave you, right up their with Salvation, and sex and all that. Don't throw it away, cuz there's always an alternative.                   Duck:  If you don't have the courage to face the world, then you deserve to die. No one wants you anyway, you pussy. But if you REALLY want to make a difference, show them that you can persevere. After all, dying's easy, it's living that's hard. Me – Both are answers, so A. for both. This is a topic that hits close to home. And despite the ratings for the answers, I think both answers are without thought or sense. I am not condoning suicide. But I have dealt with this issue personally, and there are a few things I can say with conviction.  	First of all, leading up to suicide is a disease. Your brain does not function properly, so you might as well leave the ethics of the situation. You wouldn’t, say, ask an Alzheimer’s  patient to remember to flush the toilet. By that same rationale, you can’t ask a suicidal person to give a wet slap about their own well being, or ask them politely to stop thinking about themselves.  And, well, guys, your reasoning sucks.	 Duck – Try and kill yourself, and then talk to me about cowardice. Poo- Ok, so you believe life is a gift from God. What makes you think that suicide isn’t also a gift to get out of this shitty existence? The Lord giveith, and the Lord takeith away, right?   Some final thoughts -  The winner is The Duck, with a GPA at 3.6, leading by only a beak to Poo, which was a manly 3.5. I think they’re both morons, but I suspect they knew that already, hence their fear of giving real answers most of the time. Generally, I think the Poo came off as an after school special by using God as a shield to hide behind. And the Duck, well, I did ask you previously if you stood behind your answers, and you said yes – but some of your answers reeked of bullshitty deception. How can I and my dear readers take answers like “We should sterilize everyone…” as a serious reply? 	As for myself , did learn a thing or three from this venture. I learned that being called a coward hurts a lot, and I’m not entirely sure why. I think I also may have discovered why Poo doesn’t have a girlfriend. Sexism is soooooo eighties, fella. I’ve got a lot of prejudices as well. Drugs and the discussion of the subject make me enraged. I don’t think clearly, and I get angry, and I want to stomp on things. But, inexplicably, drinking does not provoke this visceral reaction. I also discovered don’t know much of anything. I do not keep up with current events, unless those events get  urlLink Fark coverage. In short, I have come to the conclusion that I’m ignorant, and nasty.   Self knowledge is very important.

           I've been in a semi-comatose state for a few days now. When I have been awake, I've been reading Tolkien, and comic books, and debating whether or not to get a cane. There's also been a fair bit of moaning and wailing, for it feels as though i've been beaten repeatedly, but got no bruises to show. Some great headaches stopped by, and i remain entirely grateful that no matter the inconvenient and piss offs work has given me, I can still work from home, in my pjs, with a hot water bottle.       Lucas. Arrggghhhhhh. That dog drives me crazy! He's seven, so you'd think that he was a nice, sober, respectable member of society. For the most part you'd be right, but when he's not he's revolting.      He eats garbage. He doesn't have the opportunity to do this all the time. But sometimes, due to forgetfulness, we'll leave a garbage back on the kitchen floor, instead of disposing of it. When we return, he's hiding somewhere and a luxurious carpet of offal is waiting for us. Sometimes it's spread to other rooms. I have no idea why he keeps doing it - my only hypothesis is that his stomach overrides his brain on these occasions. Ok. So I tell him he's bad make loud noises, and other sorts of things, he gets a rap on the behind and gets sentenced to the bad dog corner. Months pass, and i leave garbage accessible. And we repeat the previous.     Annoying enough, but there's something else that he's been taken to doing that's worse, and I'm not sure how long he's been at it. He eats kitty poop. Kurt and i slowly figured it out, and we decided to set a trap for him to see if he does. The litter box is in the bathroom, the safest place from Lucas because he hates water, and loud noises, and loathes getting bathed. But it's dark and quiet and far less likely he'll be bathed when we're not home. Kurt fixed the litter box so if he slimed into the bathroom, he'd cause the door to shut, and shut himself in there. That, we supposed, would be a good punishment.      Alas, it was not to be. That little shit eater has locked himself in twice. This last time, though, we locked him in, soaked him, and booted his furry butt outside. I think if it occurs again, he's getting his mouth washed out with soap.      That's it for my excitement; a shit eating dog.

      How many people work in offices?  It's a lot, isn't it? I mean, you can go to the store, pick up a magazine, and there's always going to be something there about office politics, or some reference to it. Sometimes, when i pick up cosmo or maxim, I wonder about their readership, and if they alll work in these little cubes, day after day. Legions of cubicle people, reading cosmo, or maxim, or women's world, or whatever. Not while they're working, of course.    And then i think how entirely bizarre it is that all these people work in offices, in cubicles, with uncomfortable shoes and clothes, all these people, and yet, I've never worked in an office. I have a hard time picturing it. A minute amount of my friends work in offices. In fact, the job i got now is the closest thing to being an 'office job', and i can do that naked. And speaking of work, well, i mean, i look at documents, made by scores and scads, and masses of people, all of them working in cubicles, or offices, worried about office politics, and nice ties; and if i've come across their name, they're probably somewhat concerned about litigation.   I feel kind of hickish, not having any sort of frame of reference for these nine to five carpool people. Growing up, the main industries were tourist things and fishing. The only people that did office work were receptionists and doctors. Teachers had offices i suppose, but it doesn't seem to be the same thing.  I'm thankful. I couldn't deal with the people and the lights and buildings where you can't open windows.  Kurt got his marks back - I'm the proud wife of of an honors student. His grade point average is holding steady at 3.7. He's currently moaning and wailing about his two B plusses, and the fact that he didn't get an A+ on anything this semester. God. When i was in school, my GPA hovered around a 2.8. Of course, I wasn't a mature student with a wife to make proud of, nor did i in any real sense comprehend the dollar value of my education. I was more than a little batshit crazy at the time as well. Should i be given another go, I think I'd be all over the good marks.  The no pill thing is pretty much exactly the same as doing the pill thing. It is a little more painful, and way harder to sleep, but, I've got to see what I'm like under all that crap. And if it's any consolation to worried parties out there, i have done this before, it has always sucked, and i've gone running back time and time again, no harm no foul. Basically, i end up not being about to take the symptoms, and start taking the pills again. Every once in a while, though, I just have to 'see': see if i'm still depressed or it has thoughtfully poufed off elsewhere, to see if i'm physically addicted to the drugs I'm on, or if the drug is causing something I do't like, like excessive hair loss, or paranoia, or something. Kurt's watching me, as well, so no real worries of death and dismeberment. Besides, I'm cured, remember?  I think that may be why i flaked on my last appointment. Bassiedoc has somehow become less and less. Less what, I'm not sure of. Credible? Perhaps, but I would definitely recommend her to others for theraputic puposes; i think she's great. I figure it was either the  'you're cured' bit that did it, or perhaps her opinon on environmental factors. Maybe I'm just done. Maybe I'll see her again. Not in the immediate future, though.  That's all i got for now. If you see an office worker, give them a hug for me.

      The reason why the dreams i posted on Wednesday were merely disturbing has to do with a number of different factors. The pace of the dreams lacked intensity; i wasn't being hunted down, there was no sense of urgency, and there was a huge distancing between myself and the self i dreamed, know what i mean? I've been doing this thing since i was a kid - I know, almost always, when i'm dreaming. I knew then, as well, but i couldn't wake up, or take control of what was happening. A dream is typically scary if it wakes me up. It's also pretty terrible when i don't know it's a dream.  Oh, sweet song of silence! The 24hrPartyPeople left with surprisingly little noise. Didn't even realise they were gone, but the dead ringer was no ass music for two days. Homicidal urges are now within norms. Now awaiting new neighbours for me to bitch about and poop on. Eeeshh. I really hope I'm not one of those people. It's just that i like quiet, right? It's not that i have this down-deep need to hate everyone that moves within close proximity of me, right? I'm nice! Aren't I?  Got a better dealio with the job. Steady work. There's what they call an 'ongoing project' that going to last a couple of years. The project pays well, about 80$ a day if i keep my noodle on straight. Come ooooooonnnn noodle, I know you can focus!   I flaked on my last appointment with Bassiedoc. I came by it honestly - i slept in, but instead of just hurrying my bum down the road, I thought: "I hate therapy. I don't want any more pills. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to say 'fuck pills, doctors and therapists. Fuck them right in the ear.' " And with that statement over i turned and slept some more. Today is day three of pillessness. I feel just as bad as i did before, sleeping just as crappily, and i feel okie doke upstairs. We'll see how it goes. It might be an indignant response to bassiedoc saying that although I'm cured, I have to stay on the pills. As for the pills i take for the other disorder, they might as well be made of sugar. So, I'm seeing. Chances are i'll be a weepy little pain ball by the end of the week, and have to go shuffling back. But, I have to, you know, check.  And that's it. More topics please. (Except for you, Duck. You're fired.)

      Did i mention the car got reposessed?  Doesn't affect my life much, since it's been off the road since March. There's the sense of irresponsiblity happening, but i can dismiss it by reckoning that eating was far more important than paying for a car we weren't using.  Here's the thing though. The Powers that Be demand a Decision regarding said automobile. We can pay 700, and start making the payments again, or we can let them sell it, and pay the difference. We can also let them take legal action. I think we'd get a better price than they would, but 700 dollars is a remote impossiblity at this juncture, and i think the timeframe on getting the cash is a mite unreasonable.   Still can't wire the second jack right. Stupid thing. It seems simple enough - a bunch of colored wires, places where the wires should go. I think i may be missing something. Going to ask the Landlord to come by and take a look. My brand spanking new modem is awaiting me at the post office. And, I've been told by various sources that there are scads of work, so I've got some hopes here of doing catch up on the BILLLSSSS. I was looking at a budget thing i worked out a few months ago, after i started working, and by this time, i had honestly thought we'd be caught up on our damn bills. Would have to, if it weren't for those damn kids. Damn independant contracting, and vactioning lawyers! Damn them to Hades!  I had blue streaks put in my hair, to go with the blond and red streaks. The blue is much lighter than i'd like, but i do dig on the overall effect. No pictures - my webcam is a bit too prehistoric to show stuff like hair color. (No kncks here, baby, it was free, and has provided hours of pet-bothering entertainment)  Speaking of hours of entertainment, I've been watching "Firefly", and it just about beats the shit out of every show currently on TV.

      The wind blows across the artic tundra.... No, wait. That's just the fridge. It makes a soothing (and i'm not even being sarcastic here) whooooooooooooshing noise that comes and goes, like waves, only, well, not like waves, but the wind across the tundra.  I like the apartment.  The other place we lived in wasn't good. The more I'm here, the more i realise that. The other place seemed dirty somehow; even if Kurt and I cleaned, it still felt sort of unwholesome and dirty. Moak said something fairly mystic about it - that Kurt and I were at odds with some bad mojo, and we were only just breaking even. That explanation works as well as any, i suppose. Anyways, higher comfort level here. Darker, a bit last few days because since moving over, or perhaps a little before I've been getting monster headaches, and i'm definitely feeling the painness when the sun shines merrily in. (Love you Mr. Sun, I'm not complaining.)  Ok, holy SHIT. Been wracking my brain here for things to write about that are mildly entertaining. I decided to look back into one of my journals - maybe this time three years ago something happened that'd be funny to relate here.   Three years ago, I was really, really batshit crazy. And in love,or something kinda like it. Was working on a golfcourse for the summer, totally fucking hating it, and i was sick, very sick with depression and withdrawal symptoms. Here are some choice quotes from June/July of 01:  "The most striking image of the day was a deeply tanned man in golf shorts, shirt and cleats puffing whitely on a cigarette on the practice tee. He held the cigarette with a black gloved hand. As he turned to face me (although he did not look up to see the diminutive barmaid standing on the deck, waiting for rain) I could clearly see some sloppy, floppy tits jigging slightly with the movement of his turn. How Lovely."  "I'm sick of being sick. I should have died a year ago."  "I just wish she'd take her brain off neutral..."  "...he's finally clued in that I'm a lemon-flavored basket case"  Great stuff. Embarrassing to read, a bit. I wax pretty poetic about a number of young men, and it's not like i didn't feel what i wrote, but wow, i felt like THAT over someone who isn't Kurt? And some things i can't relate to anymore. Now that's a concept, my dear avid readers - have you ever thought for a second that you'd get to a point where you couldn't relate to yourself? And, holy hell the difference between Robyn then and Robyn now is three years. Three. A fart in a windtunnel.  I'm grateful.  In other news, I'm happy that friendly people come and visit me. Red and Ajax dropped by, Baka and Peasel came and ate stew and talked about stuffi want to know more about. Slight downside, though. I feel like my head is crammed hard up my ass when i talk to people lately. Or that my tongue is too thick for my mouth. There are a few people i see on a regular basis, and that feeling is not there, but i feel like i'm close to drooling if i attempt to have a Real Live Conversation with people i see but rarely. I guess I'm just excited.

      For any of you who ever thought that i might have been smart, here is proof that i really am daft. So, we moved, eh? Good, Aliant on strike and all of that, so we figured we'd be in for a bit of a go when it came to the phone.   Read this:  June 17, 2004   I’m in exile. Dramatics aside, since Saturday, I’ve been more out of step with the rest of the planet than I usually am. We’re now in our lovely one-bedroom apartment, two doors down from the original. It’s nicer here, somehow. The smaller space doesn’t seem smaller. The phone company is on strike, though, so getting our number reconnected is a bigger pain in the arse than it usually is. And the internet? Hoo boy. Evidently, I’m getting a new modem, e-mail address and internet start up kit. No one has yet given me a good reason why that is, but The Powers That Be assure me I will regain touch by the 15th or so. (Never mind the singular fact that the 15th was two days ago.) Haven’t called work for obvious reasons. I didn’t call them beforehand because I was under the delusion that the moving process wouldn’t eat up a significant chunk of time. Friends and family probably think I’m dead or in the depths of despair, and I can just hear my mother fairly cackle that I am such an ungrateful child, I didn’t even call my own father on Father’s Day. So, in a huge way, this all sucks.  In another, though, I’m enjoying the quiet time the move has afforded us. Kurt’s not home during the day anymore- he’s off doing handyman things 45 minutes away. I’ve been playing an excessive amount of Age of Mythology, and I’ve been spending time in front of Microsoft word; trying to trick myself into thinking I’m a writer. I haven’t been moping the floor, which I ought to, but I have been doing the dishes, and being a relatively good Susie Homemaker. I’ve had a lot of time to think. A lot of time to rest as well, but that hasn’t been happening.. I’m on the famine side of sleeping, and the most I can manage is about 2hrs sleep a night, and, if I’m exceedingly lucky, some Zz during the day. I’ve been spending a lot of times in sweltering baths. I was supposed to go put in some volunteer time at the shelter today, but my body informed me that there was no possible way I was getting down that hill and back. Didn’t call, for obvious reasons, and no one was at the neighbours to borrow their phone. Should I have mentioned that mobility was an issue? Bah.  The peace and quiet is awesome. It will become too much soon, I think. The next door neighbour is a quietish fella with more than a passing love of his van, a Chevrolet astro-something-or-other. No idea about the other people in the building.  We’re running low on groceries. We also need to get our tax money back before the University decides that we’ve stolen the laptop. And bills need to be paid, and Stuff transferred over – new mailing address, power bill. Little pains.   Yeah huh.  Here's the thing, though. The phone was ringing. Moak phoned us a few times, and it rang away, and Kurt, Moak and myself wondered where it could possibly be ringing to. We checked the phone every day. I waited for my internet package. And then, today, I pushed the connector so it actually went into the phone, and here i am, world. Connected again, although it took about two weeks to figure out that we were connected all along. Duuuuuuuuuuuuork. Still waiting for the internet connection, though. If there's work to be had, i want all over it.  Anyone, incidently, know how to fix a telephone jack?

      I promise I will not make little screaming noises as i cross the street.  I promise to follow doctors' orders.  I promise to stop looking up diseases on the internet.  I promise not to be secretly derisive of people who make a little line across the number seven.  I promise to walk Lucas more, and to tease him less.  I promise to tease Phoebe more.  I promise to actually answer the phone instead of just looking at it and thinking "Well, I'll see him/her on the internet later..."  I promise to floss at least once a week.  I promise to stop thinking that my time is a limited resource.  I promise to stop singing the theme to "Spongebob Squarepants"- at least, in public.  With the weather warming up, I'm feeling pretty homesick. I've been dreaming about the Beach, and summer evenings playing laser tag, and nightswimming. I'm starting to miss people i can't stand, even. Cape Breton hasn't been my home since i was 17, but it seems to be the framework in which i experience all reality. Everything is compared to Home. And it wholeheartedly sucks. It's a place I haven't been able to share with Kurt, so, Home becomes a bit of a sore point - he doesn't understand my attachment. Neither do i, to be honest. Beautiful land, dear friends, but those friends have moved on, and they are only a phone call away. So, why the attachment to the place?  Memories. I think that's it. The good and the bad instances, the amount of them, is an anchor that keeps me home. Sort of stuck-like. It feels like the greater part of myself is tethered there, and i think in the past that was all well and good - but now i want it back. I can't give myself entirely to my present, my future and my Kurt with such a handicap. Now I just have to figure out how to let it go.

      Welcome to my day of rest. Spent most of the day in bed, with the notable exceptions of letting in and out and in and out and in and out this psychotic little furball. Damn cat. She's been slipping further and further towards the Dark (and Annoying) side the last few days. She's insisting loudly that she's starving to death every possible moment, and she's been rather indecisive as to where she wants to sleep. Brat cat.  Volunteering at the vet's on thursday. I'm looking forward to it, although it does mean that there will be noxious smells to contend with. Lots of kittens, though, and i may be able to bring Lucas down for kitty visits.   Not much else is going on - Kurt is handymanning it, I'm hoping i'm not going to have to give up on the current job, but it's looking bleaker every day, and Lucas is a happy puppy.

      Since using Irish Spring, after every shower, I feel like I've been bathed in interestingly smelling fiberglass. I think it's time to shell out the coin for some pears. The soap, not the fruit.  It's finally a sunny day, and i feel better. Not exactly sure if the sun has something to do with it, or merely the fact that me and the gang got semi-trashed last night and watched hockey. Nothing embarassing happened, and i have to say that it was the first time ever that my body stopped hurting. The whole thing - even my back relaxed. I should be drunk all the time. There might be certain practical problems, but hey, i'd be comfortable.  Weird thing though, with the consumption of alcohol - I almost always feel guilty after. No harm done, no grim and dire consequences; but nonetheless i feel as if i did something wrong, sort of. Only sort of. It's like I did something stupid, and don't remember it. It doesn't happen if i have a beer or three, just in the cases where i achieve drunkenness. I suppose it is an excellent thing that drunkeness happens but once a year, thereabouts.  Nothing really has been happening since last i wrote. I've been in bed quite a bit. Bed, unfortunately, doesn't mean sleeping. I think I'm going to try and catch up with my GP in a clinic to get more meds for fibromyaglia. I was wrong when i thought the drugs weren't doing anything. They don't do much, but it is better than my current scenario.  Kurt is now gainfully employed as a handyman. Right now he's working off our rent and doing so beautifully, and as of monday, he works for real money. The downside is that he'll be a commuter, racing down the highway of doom twice a day. Another drawback is long hours, but he's happy as a clam doing what he's doing. Now if work would pick up, we'd be a-ok. For the time being though, i guess we'll settle for ok.

      I wasn't going to write about this.   I woke up on the17th with a bruise sort of pain. On my ass. I had no idea how a bruise would get on my ass, and in such a place on my ass, but i did recall that years ago, i had crashed a bike pretty damn good, and this was a similar pain, so i thought 'yeah, this is a bruise. '  I haven't ridden a bike in three years. So, the orgins of said bruise were wrapped in mystery Still, it was a bruise. On my ass. In between my cheeks. Right-o.  Days later. The pain, instead of going away has intensified to a whining scream. Weird, thought I, but since it's in such a funny place, it only stands to reason that the bruise wouldn't heal so good- there's perpetual pressure going on there.  On the 29th, i just about beat the poop out of my dog. For barking. Peculiar, since this is  something that dogs do, and i do encourage Lucas to be a watch dog. He was doing his guard dog job, and i thought about killing him (just for a second) to shut him up. The pain now has become absolutely excruciating, and nothing could relieve it. I had three scalding baths that day. I also blacked out a couple times.  Woke up the morning, of the 30th, and it was a countdown to 5pm, when the walk-in clinic opened. Walking in presented a problem. It took hours, and went sort of like this: Shuffle shuffle. "Lord, please strike me dead." Shuffle shuffle. "The last thing i want to do today is show a doctor my arse. It's a bruise. i'm overreacting." Shuffle shuffle. "I don't need to show these good people my ass." Shuffle shuffle. "I wonder, if i hitchhike, will someone pick me up?" Shuffle shuffle. "Owowowowowowow." Shuffle shuffle.  I get to the clinic. The receptionist does her receptionist thing, and asks "And what is the reason for your visit?" I lean over, and whisper. "I have a horrible pain in my bum." She blinks a few times. "I'm sorry? Could you say that again?" "I have a Bad Pain in my Bum" "Uh, you mean, down there?" "Yes," I hiss. "All right, please take a seat. Er..."  I was stunned by the speed of nonwaiting. I had come in behind a few people, and yet i had the dubious honor of being first to be called in. The nurse chatted me up, looked at my bum, andfussed over me a bit. "You walked HERE? You weren't taking anything at all for the pain? Bless your heart."  The doctor came in almost right away, and he looked at my bum. He  poufed , and came back with another doctor's name on a percription slip. Told me i had to go a town over to the hospital, and it wasn't in my best interests to wait. I had an abcess on my tender rear, and it had to be drained immediately. The doctor on the slip would fix me.  I phoned pizzamomma from the waiting room phone to ask her to come get me from the clinic and take me to Emergency. Worried, she asked me what was wrong. Embarassment hit again. (Waiting room with a few people in it. Was not going to mention to the room that i had something amounting to a HUGE pimple on my butt.) and i said not to worry, and that i'd tell her once she came and got me.  My doctor was Thai, with a Very Efficient manner, but quite friendly nonetheless. The nurses were not of the soul-sucking bitch variety i had encountered  countless time in C-City. They were nice, and they clucked their sympathy.  Eat fiber, folks. You do not want this happening to you. They taped my buttcheeks open. How's THAT for vulnerabilty...? The doctor applied local anasthetic, and i still ended up passing out from the pain. He let me know that this is something that becomes easier to get after the first time, and that i had to change my diet, and address my weight. 'And,' he added, 'The next time it will be an operation, and we'll have to put you to sleep.' Gahh.  All in all, it was an entirely unpleasant, embarassing and a horribly  bodily  experience. But, it was definitely funny. For instance, it was pizzamomma's birthday. At one point i moaned to her that this was no way to spend a birthday, but she told me that now she'll always remember her 25th.  They sent me home with a perscription for pennicilin, gauze between my buttcheeks, a list of things to buy from the pharmacy, and a new hole in my ass the size and shape of a cap of toothpaste. Standing up felt like a song - it didn't hurt any more!  Well, it hurt some. But not in comparison to previously.  Unfortunately, around11pm, the local anasthetic wore off. And that's where i'm at now - hobbling about in pain. In my ass.

      Sweetness opened the box, and the little guy hissed. Awww. He's full of rambunction, likes to cuddle near faces, and we've come to learn that hissing is really just his way of saying 'Hi'. No name as of yet, but we have the fall back of Monster should he remain nameless.  Lucas is slightly bewildered.   Phoebe is immensely pissed off, but extremely curious about the kittens' whereabouts and goings&nbsp;on.  In other news, I'm extremely tired, and sore, and may eventually drag my carcass to see the GP about controlling these funlike fibro symptoms. Or not. Right now, walking to the clinic and back is a laughable concept.  Happpppiiiiiiiiieee birthdays to Chad, Peasel, and my Daddio.   Back to bed i go i go.

      Still sleeping excessively. Feels odd, damn it, very odd. There's something that says to my body 'you're really gross' when i sleep during the day. There seems to be a relationship between sleep and pain; more sleep, less, pain.&nbsp;   I hate the sense of bewilderment upon waking. I never know what time of day it is, if it is day, or what day. A few times i woke and did not recognize my surroundings. Icky feelings.  I think i've been isolating myself again. A knock on the door causes a fairly signifigant anxiety response, same with the phone ringing. The regular visitors to the apartment are being largely avoided. Maybe i just don't want to hear about their days that are filled with stuff. I know it takes a lot of energy to talk - maybe i'm too tired.   Definitely too tired to be even remotely entertaining. Good night.  &nbsp;

      I've been eating and sleeping the last couple of days. Cutting in on my eating and sleeping is final fantasy ten which entertains and fascinates me, and drives me frigging crazy with the bad writing/dialogue/translation. (I'm not sure which to blame.) It's a great story, it's beautiful, but why, oh why does Tidus have to refer to his father as 'my old man' constantly? Can't he call him "Dad" just once?  Stillllllllllllllllllll waiting for the kitten. Give me the kitten! Show me the kitten! Kitteny goodness, come on!  There's not much else going on. I'd love to say i'm working, but not so much. Anyone know how to make microsoft outlook check for e-mails alla time, and make the damn thing ding when i get one? Today, there was a project that opened at 5pm. When i got the e-mail, at 9pm, the project was already closed. They're starving us. When we get something, everyone swoops down like so many vultures to pick the bones. But, looking at it from the Company's point of view, i suppose it's pretty effiecient to do it this way - projects get done a lot faster. Is it inappropriate, do you think, to find out who the boss is, and find out WTF is going on? File a complaint? Do something that will in all likelihood get ignored, but do it anyways?  It's frustrating. I love the work. I like working from home, and i find the work makes my brain happy. But trying to talk to any of the people is like banging my head up against a rather solid brick wall.  If you want to throughly depress yourself, read 'The Beauty Myth' by Naomi Wolf.&nbsp; Read an interesting section today, all about peoples' sexuality, and where it comes about, according to her, we&nbsp; have "...begun to be shaped in response to cues that are no longer human." She goes on further to say that sexual identity comes from magazines, and popular culture. Pictures of people no longer correspond to what people look like in actuality. Even the models that the pictures are taken of don't look like they do in those pictures, airbrushed, and cropped, and with the optimal lighting and that. She goes on to assert that this is causing deep seated problems with all aspects of sexual development from self-identification to relationships. If what the 'norm' of how a person looks isn't even human anymore, what does that do to us? Especially considering how these photos are taken - you know what i mean; unreal distortions of facial expressions; these ladies are supposed to look turned on, but they sort of looked pained. That's assuming that there's even a head in the photo - how many mostly naked torsos have you seen in advertisments? Just a leg, maybe?   We're in it now. Shit, i mean. Kids that are in grade six are 'hooking up' with one another and playing sex games,&nbsp; and porn, a sign that we are in Babylon, is getting more and more hardcore. for example, anal sex is swiftly becoming the norm, whereas even five years ago, it was something considered pretty kinky. And it seems at the frontline of porn that anal sex isn't enough, more degredation and humilation are where the jollies are.  That's enough on that. It's already too much.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I had another one of those dreams in which girls from elementary walked by me, shoved by me in the IGA without saying hello.  &nbsp; I was never invited to sleepovers. The only one i went to i brought a book. Bad idea. Luckily there was someone there to make the night exciting - the caper involved masking tape and the sleeping girls. I never went to a sleepover again, which, all-in-all, i think was a good thing.&nbsp;(At the time, however, i was devestated,and rejected, and thusly, revelled in reject status, cultivating that and the chip on my shoulder)&nbsp;Too many disturbing things happened at that one. Girls pulled other girls' pjamas off. There was some dancing to a song called 'push it' (remember that terrible, terrible song? ) that can&nbsp;was definitely naughty, but in retrospect, entirely ridiculous, due to the aforementioned pjs, and the fact that these tremendously naughty girls were all of thirteen. &nbsp; I never understood the importance of make-up, or coiffed hair. Or the coolness of underage drinking, and other things that seemed to captivate the hearts and minds of these other aliens in girl-form. The appeal of New Kids On The Block.  &nbsp; I wonder if that's why I'm plagued by these moronic dreams; dreaming of girls who didn't like me, didn't understand me, while i was entirely baffled by them. It's funny. Most who have a deep-seated dislike of school can trace their distaste to high school, at least, that's how it seems. For me it was the exquistite pain of elementary. In high school, there was a measure of acceptance, it was hell for entirely different reasons. &nbsp; Were these girls really all that different from me in actuality, do you think? Sometimes, I'm not so sure. Right now they seem a sort of homogenous;and light, and fluffy-&nbsp;like cotton candy. But that can't be right. I remember flashes&nbsp;of individuality, of at least insecurity - the girl who tried a new hairstyle, and whispered to me in the bathroom 'Do i really look like a dog with my hair like this?' There was the girl who was a lot tougher than most; she always went to school, ill or not. She threw up one day in class, she tried so hard to make it to the bathroom. She made it to the garbage can by the teacher's desk. The smell was awful, and one of the few boys in the class ran to the back of the room to open&nbsp;a window. Unfortunately, he underestimated the effect the puke smell would have on him. He shoved his nose under his t-shirt, but it didn't help. He puked, too. I don't remember him having a another&nbsp;shirt to change into. I hope he did. &nbsp; I remember having my lunch box made fun of on my first day of school, because it was a superman lunch box, and according to Them, it was a boy's lunchbox. That, i think, sort of set the tone. I skipped grade one, something i disuss seldom because there was a ton of garbage that went with it. The kids thought i had skipped because a few days before i talked and talked about a new unmanned submersible that could and did inspect the remains of the Titanic. It was the first to do so, and i had read all about it in my Dad's National Geographic. And then, i was moved forward.  &nbsp; And here ends that part of the story.

      I'm not sure where they are. &nbsp; I know they're here. Buzzing. Waiting for me to fall asleep so they can torture me upon awakening. The little bastards haveinflicted countless horrors upon me, and i am completely defenseless. Fucking mosquitos.  &nbsp; I've got at least two dozen war wounds on my feet, and they're driving me insane. I've got anti-itch stuff i rub on Lucas' hot spots, but the problem is that when i happen to touch any of the itchy spots - one foot touching my other foot whilst i nap, for instance, the rampant itching begins again. &nbsp; Little flybite trivia for you - did you know the reason why bite sitch is because most humans are allergic to buggy saliva? My uncle is one of the truly blessed people on this planet who aren't allergic. The guy could get bitten thousands of times, and never know it. &nbsp; Plans for the anniversary outing went as planned. The food was wonderful, and the company unparalled.  &nbsp; Little mr. kitten has yet to arrive.  &nbsp; Kurt brought home another way to rip my 'social life' away - he brought home final fantasy ten. I said today i'd play for a little while. Three hours later, i had to wrench myself from the TV. Good game, if you're a fan of pretty graphics, and good storytelling.  &nbsp; And now, time for bed. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      No kitty for us. Not yet. Sweetness assures little mr. kitty will be by before the end of the week, but i have a sneaking suspicison it'll be a mite longer than that. No worries, here, still need to think up a name and so on. (Suggestions welcome)  &nbsp;  Kurt and i will be married for two years tomorrow. It seems like the time isn't right - rather we should be married forever, or just yesterday. We're going to the local chic munchy-munchy for cheaper chic munchies - Tapas at the Tempest. Tasty food, and special, and not zillions of dollars expensive that we can't afford to spend. The plan is to eat like dirty rotten piggies when we get enough of our debts paid off. (You'll note i didn't say 'when we get our debts paid'. I fancy myself a realist.)  &nbsp;  Two years. On that day of bwessid awangement, that dweam wifin a dweam, Lucas was ring bearer, siblings were witnesses, and both myself and Kurt nearly threw up. I partially blacked out, and kurt couldn't stop laughing. And we cried a bunch. I can't imagine getting married in front of a whole whack of people, it was too personal. I think my prejudice springs from the fact that Kurt and i did go through a church wedding of sorts - his sister's wedding was in august of that same year. It was hell- and neither of us had any major part in it. The stress of bringing together two families, quarrels, the sheer PRICE of everything, not to mention strange backstabbing bridesmaids and endless shopping for crap you'll never wear ever again - wow. Not something that suggests anything marriage is supposed to represent. (Unless, of course, you're going for the whole marriage-is-a-huge-pain-in-the-ass motif.) It worked ok, don't get me wrong,&nbsp;Missy's&nbsp;wedding went off&nbsp;without a hitch, and it was lovely. Still - it was a huge pain in the ass. &nbsp;  I was going to put down here a poem i had written to Kurt after we first got engaged, but to my surprise, and well, relief, I can't find it. Here's an E.E. Cummings poem that sums things up much more nicely than i could&nbsp;instead:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  one's not half two.&nbsp; It's two are halves of one:  which halves reintegrating,shall occur  no death and any quantity;but than  all numerable mosts the actual more  &nbsp;  minds ignorant of stern miraculous  this every truth-beware of heartless them  (given the scalpel,they dissect a kiss;  or,sold the reason,they undream a dream)  &nbsp;  one is the song which fiends and angels sing:  all murdering lies by mortals told make two.  Let liars wilt,repaying life they're loaned;  we(by a gift called dying born)must grow  deep in dark least ourselves remembering  love only rides his year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All lose,whole find  &nbsp;

      Hopefully, we're getting a kitten today. Sweetness from last summer's pizza shop of love is coming over for dinner, and bringing four boy kittens that we can choose to be the newest member of our funny little family. However, Sweetness lives a good bit away, so there's no guarentee she'll make it in.  Went back to work on Friday - we're back in high-speed land - and i'm relieved to find that i still like the work, although communication problems within the Company are enough to drive a person to bloody homicidal rage. Case in point: I asked my supervisor to forward all my e-mail to an alternative address a month ago, so that way i wouldn't miss projects, info, etc. Never got any, which is entirely possible, since we were in a work drought. Got high speed back, and there's 30 e-mails waiting for me. Thanks, fella.  Kurt also started work with the company, so now we're both gainfully employed, Kurt twice over, even. Now to wait for the money to pour in, and then pour right back out as we attempt to become good little Capitalists. Fun stuff.   I'm still the Mistress of Peculiar Sleep Habits. It feels fundamentally wrong to sleep 16+ hours a few nights, then 2 the next, but i think I'm done arguing with my body. (It invariably wins, anyhow.)I'm getting a lot of odd-hour housework done. My bathroom has never been so clean.  One of the great joys of high speed is the fast-paced perusal of flash animations.  urlLink Here  you go. Enjoy. More forthcoming, as well as haikus for the masses.   Writing assignment for the bored: A haiku about spiderman 2. Remember kids, a haiku is dependant on its form. It must be three lines, with each line containing a set number of syllables - five for the first line, seven for the second, and five for the third line. Go forth, and spread haiku goodness to all the world.

      I've been good. I got up today at 3pm, which was a noble feat considering the way i've been zombified lately. My plan was a simple one: To sleep when my dear husband sleeps. And, hopefully by this to achieve the ultimate goal: To be awake when Kurt is awake. (Tertiary goals include enjoying the summertime by doing things during daylight, getting a tan - or at least to stop wearing the pallor of the undead, seeing friends during daylight hours, and so on.)  And although i was yawning at ten pm, and although it seemed that the night was wearing down rightly at 12am, 4am found me lying in bed, yawning, feeling a powerful urge to scrub the bathtub.   Here i am, at 4.56am, with a very clean tub that smells like pink. Dead serious on the pink thing. It's lysol, and i decided to get summer fresh lysol, because summer smells nice. According to the good folks at lysol, though, summer smells like pink chemicals came to die in an anti-bacterial spray.   Just kidding. I don't buy anti-bacterial crap. Bacteria is good for you, and the alternative to the bacteria we have are bigger, and far more scary bacteria.  Now i have this very clean slightly cloying pink smell wafting about. And pink smells sort of like someone ate something cute and decomposing, drank some lysol, then threw up. And yet i can't bring myself to throw the stuff out. Who knows when I'll see the inside of a grocery store again keeping the hours i do? By the time i get a lysol that smells less pink, all sorts of unsavory things will take up residence in my bathtub. And they will become an unholy army of darkness, and i'll have to be the overlord, and taking over the world is such a hassle, and really, who the hell needs that sort of responsibilty?  You know, Kurt has been telling me the last week or so not to look a gift horse in the mouth about the sleeping thing. (Hey, you know where that phrase comes from? You can tell a horse's age by its teeth, so if someone gave you a horse, you shouldn't be critical, because, hey, a horse is a horse, of course, of course.)Anyways, yeah. Kurt's been all about me enjoying this sleep, this gift from god. To sleep is to heal right? But, being the malcontent i am, I've been flossing the damn horse's teeth. And you know what? I'm not sleeping! Right now. Right now, I am not sleeping, and i'm dog ass tired. I think i'm cursed.  I'm going to go scrub the toilet.

      I feel restless, and i keep on having dreams where the Wanderer has decided not to speak to me; it is because I'm too tired to go hiking. She tells me that since I'm so tired all the time, i ought to just stay in bed because she's sick of being slowed down by me. This is NOT something she'd say in real life. Evidently, though, it is something that's concerning me. Think it has to do with me sleeping excessive amounts last little bit. It's frustrating; Kurt had a three day weekend, but i didn't have the energy to get up and do anything. There is considerably less pain, though.  We decided on letting the car go ahead and be sold by The Powers That Be. "Decision" is possibly too strong a word - there were simply no other viable options. Kurt's been wanting to unload the car pretty big the last year or so anyways, so it isn't a big deal at all; just sort of strange not seeing the fruity purple civic given up to entropy in the driveway. We are planning on purchasing a secondhand car when we can - ideally, a jetta that runson diesel.  The guy next door has done remarkable things to his van. I don't know technicalities, but it is shinier, has more lights in odd areas, and in short, looks sort of like a maroon alien space craft. He puts in full days working on it - the guy loves his van.  Started playing D&D with the boys again. I play a kender rogue, so i'm short, devoid of fear, and have the attention span of a goldfish. Been pretty fun so far. I have this bag that's magic, and therefore bottomless, and the stuff i end up picking up is surprising even to myself.  and that's it.

      Later today, i go back to  the hospital. They're putting me under,and cutting up my behind again.  I've never had to go under anasthesia before, and although this isn't a big deal, and although it's a very minor procedure, I'm absolutely terrified.  I had the follow up with the surgeon yesterday; i didn't heal so good, and there seems to be another abcess, hence the cutting. He tried to do some work on it today, but i was in far too much pain, and completely panic stricken.  Still pretty panic stricken. I'll give you a million dollars if you get me out of this.  You know, i did some reading on the subject of abcesses, and those glorified zits are a lot more than a pain in the ass. I guess left long enough, the putressence can seep into the bloodstream, causing blood poisioning, and that can kill you. I guess that explains the miraculous non-wait at the clinic.  I'm going to sleep. Think happy thoughts for me.
