      My awesome friend Jodi has been giving me a hard time about not doing the Blogger after she told me my last few journals sounded pathetic. So, after I sucked up my pride, I decided to give this thing another shot.  The last few weeks I have dedicated to slowing down somewhat and not taking on too much all at once. It gets hectic being ultra busy.  This week my projects are to apply to the Houston Press for a job as a staff writer. It's right up my alley-features, short news and A&E pieces and listings. Although Houston isn't my first choice for a place to live, I know people there, there's great culture and&nbsp;it's probably cheap to live. There's also this hottie that I have a bit of a crush on that lives there....  Well, I'm off to work. Ta, ta for now.

      It was Meaghan's birthday last night, so I met up with them for a few drinks after work at the Shoe Shop. Almost all the people who were there were friends of my ex-girlfriends, but I had spewed off about her the night before while hanging out with Jill and Kevin, so I made it my goal not to talk about her at all, although her name was mentioned several times. I figured, it's time to put it in the past and concentrate on the future. It ended up being quite lame at the elegant Shoe Shop, so we walked down the street to Stage Nine, which was the fifth time in two and a half weeks I had been there. The usual crowd was there for open mic night, which featured some great bands and some not-so-great bands. I saw Sean, a fellow employee of The Coast and a member of the Burdocks there with an extremely attractive lady. Unfortunately, he did not introduce me and I almost didn't mind. I'm quite apathetic to female kind right now. I figure, if something happens, then something happens. I'm not really at the point of making something happen. Soon enough, I suppose. Although it was a short night, I had a good night out with my friends. I am quite glad that I am still friends with my "ex-girlfriend crew." They are all very supportive and great people. As for tonight, it's a lonely night in. I'm making dinner, then going to the gym to get sexy. Fun, fun.

      I spent some time with two of my friends that just got married last night. Coincidently, I broke up with my girlfriend a week after their wedding. Perhaps it has some measure to do with being single again, but I noticed new things while I hanging out with them, mainly how happy they are together. It's the little things: as we sat on their patio, Kevin, the husband, asked us if we wanted another drink. Before he walked inside, he stopped to kiss his new wife. It was a simple, but sure sign and reminder of affection. They are extremely happy. It's as if they are in a constant state of afterglow. It makes it difficult to be around after a while, as I feel like a  voyeur, spying on their happily-ever-after life when I have nothing close to it. It happens a lot when couples get married. The single friends get relegated to the back of the emotional scrap heap. People like to say that they don't change when they get married, but they're only kidding themselves. Their priorities change to focus in on one another. All else is decoration, including the single friends. It's different amongst married couples when they are friends with other married couples. When this coven of happiness gets together, they can relate to the lifestyle they all have chosen. As a recent dumpee, I almost makes me ill to see how happy two people can be together. You can't help but dwell on the things that went wrong with your previous relationship. I love my married friends, but it hurts to hang out with two people that are at the point you hoped to be at one day with someone that used to be in love with you.

      Went out to the Marquee last night to see former Halifax resident Jill Barber, In-Flight Safety, Brian Borcherdt, Mardeen and Heavy Blinkers play. I couldn't stay late as I had to be at work at 8:30 the next morning, but I got to see Jill, Brian, Mardeen and some of In-Flight Safety before I left. Jill was her usual sultry self and told me before the show that things in Toronto were going well since she's been there. Mardeen wore their Strokes influences on their sleeves, but they are young and show some potential. Brian Borcherdt, I've never seen before, but plays good, emotive, Yarmouth rock that shares a lot of similarities to his Wintersleep/Kary brethren. I would definitely go see him play again. The best moment of the night, however, came when I finally talked to Eva, the extremely cute indie girl that works at Video Difference. She looked even better out in public and we had a nice chat. She had a friend with her, who was attractive, but I paid little attention to her as I was completely transfixed by her gorgeous, crystal blue eyes and inviting smile. The best moment of the night was unfortunately followed by the worst moment when Eva mentioned that her boyfriend was a friend of Borcherdt's. All hope of living happily ever after with a cute, interesting girl and free movies went down the drain. Just when things couldn't get much worse, I see her with her boyfriend, a paunchy, nerdy guy. She looked happy, however, and I'm not the kind of guy to go after another man's girl because I know exactly how it feels when you're the other guy. My luck can't get much worse right now. Like the Travis song says: Why does it always rain on me?
