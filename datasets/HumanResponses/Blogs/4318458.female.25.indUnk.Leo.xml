      Last night was one of the most dreadful nights in my life (actually last early morning cuz it happened during the wee hours of the night of aug. 24). This may sound pathetic or something to some (or most?!) of you guys around here, but to me it was something big and it's something that I wanna share :)  I know my baby might kill me coz of this but I really wanna share this. Anyways, my boyfriend and I had the most tiring, audacious, mind-wrecking, tear-jerking (for my part that is..haha!) and scariest fight we've ever had since we've been together. It started with just one petty misunderstanding that led to me telling him that I wanna cool off (or give some time alone).. Whoa! Yeah, whoa for me! I never expected that would come from my own mouth. It was the most tactless thing to say especially that it was something that I really didn't wanna do but I said it anyways. Well, it was also because I got so scared that he would get tired of our fights and suddenly leave me (yeah, yeah, sorta crazy but me being the paranoid type, that'll be the case then..in my mind). Anyways, he didn't wanna agree on my "bright" idea coz he didn't wanna risk our relationship with just one petty fight. It was really sweet, you know, how he didn't wanna let go and telling me how important I am to him. And so with all the talking and my crying, (that lasted till almost 5am!!) I finally got into my rational side and realized that I'm such a stupid girl to actually let go of this guy. We made so many promises already to each other and one of those is to never leave each other's side especially when we most needed each other and here I am leaving him when he most needed me.   To cut the story short, we both said our I love you's and the I'm Sorry's and we went to sleep with puffy eyes and red noses but with a happy smile and a peaceful thought coz we both know that no one will ever leave anyone..ever.. even if one tries to, the other won't bulge and instead put some sense to one's mind :)

      Woohoo! Lasalle won! Finally! Despite my not being able to watch it live with my bestfriend (for the 1st time! argh!), I guess it's ayt as long as they won over Ateneo and didn't stumbled down during the last few minutes. It would've been better if we were able to watch it live tho but as usual it's not really easy to get tickets especially if we're talking about the Ateneo vs. Lasalle game.   So, as I watch the game at home, I was shouting and jumping (my mom making me stop coz the neighbors might wonder what's going on in here.. haha!) when we led Ateneo a shocking 31 points at the end of the first half. I was also stunned by the way our team played and how the Ateneans stumbled down. It was unlikely of them to be like that. But as the 3rd quarter started, I kinda knew they'd be able to catch up.. and so they did.. and so I tried not to watch the game for a few minutes and instead go to the kitchen and fix my Food for the Gods (incase you're interested, I accept orders.. hehe.. talk about advertising my product! haha!). I was scared to see our team lose again after leading that long and that big (remember the first game?). But I guess our players are more confident now that they can do it and so at the end we won :) Animo Lasalle! Congrats to the team and to us! Finally we got a chance! And so me and my bestfriend got anxious again in watching game LIVE.. haha!
