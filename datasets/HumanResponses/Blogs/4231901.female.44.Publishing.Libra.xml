      Follow your bliss... no wiser words were ever spoken. Those who make themselves happy make others happy. We live in a world where most people expect someone else - their spouse, their kids, their boss, the government - to make them happy. Ain't gonna happen folks. You're responsible for your own happiness.  That's why I chose Blissful as my Blogger display name. I am usually a pretty happy person. I've followed my own bliss for the most part, especially in the past seven or eight years, and I always make sure I'm aware of my own good fortune in life, especially compared to that of others, even many of the people I know in person. The saying "if he didn't have bad luck, he wouldn't have any luck at all" is true for some people I know. So I always remind myself how lucky I am to have a job, a roof over my head, food in my belly and many, many, many other necessary and not-necessary things that make my life pleasurable and fruitful.  Ironically though, I don't usually feel compelled to blog when I'm feeling blissful. Been this way all my life. Anyone picking up my old hand-written diaries would probably conclude that I'm depressed, a moper and an incredible whiner. That, and lovesick. Bigtime.  I had a blog on another site and it didn't offer many services, so I came here after checking out a friend's blog. (We'll see if he finds MY blog among the others here.) I read over the entries yesterday and realized that the main reason I tend to blog is when I'm feeling lonesome, or hurt or whatever...because of a man, or because of the lack of a man.  LOL... pretty pathetic really. Here I am, going to be turning 45 in two months, moping about boys. But that's usually what I'm compelled to write about. Hopefully I'll come up with some other more interesting fodder for those of you who take the time to read me. I *am* a writer, published, so I should be able to at least make my boy-blogs somewhat entertaining to read. If nothing else.  I liked the fact that people can comment on the blogs on this site. I'm vain enough to think a few folks might take a moment to share their thoughts on something I've said. I'd welcome that, if any of you are so inclined. And I may move the entries from the othe blog site over here, just to keep everything all in one place. I like things to be organized (says she who has at least 5 different email addresses).  So... read on McDuff. I hope you find it mildly entertaining, amusing, perhaps a little bit insightful now and then. And maybe I'll be drinking in your words one of these times...you never know.
