      hmm...jenna left me at rehearsal tonight that kinda sucked. britt ended up having to take me to my car at jenna's dad's. so i didn't get home til almost midnight. and on top of that i smashed my leg on a freaken stool. and let me tell you it hurt like a ..well you know what. good thing that knee was already screwed up if not i might have been in trouble. wow. my ex who i was with for almost 2 years decided to step back in my life tuesday night and ever since then my life has been on a down slide...imagine that. then there's my other ex..he's a jerk. but he won't go away. what can i say i attract winners. now i've had to enlist drew's help to find out if aaron's going to date me or if i'm wasting my time. oh yea i dyed my hair last night...its now "Plum" haha its basically burgendy. haha yes sexy. j/k. haha i was a complete b...the other night it was great. we were at crockett's cuz it was kareoke night and then of course the guys blew us off and julissa and aaron were fighting along with the rest of the world and so we were all outside 'cept for court and aaron and i walked in and i was like its almost midnight and you have to&nbsp; be home in like 5 minutes. and then we were walking out and she was like i was talking to aaron and i was like i saw that i don't honestly give a f*** but i saw that. haha anger management. i probably should take a course in that. i'm honestly about to give up on aaron. he's so freaken confusing and guys talk about girls being confusing. ha we aren't have as bad as them. oh yea les mis opens in a week...we only have 2 rehearsals left...uh oh...

      well. the soap opera continues...i found out aaron's other "option" he was thinking about going back out with julissa but then lets just say that doesn't look very promising. but then again "me and aaron" doesn't seem very likely to happen either. but hey on the "bright" side i got to see my ex boyfriend who i dated off and on for almost 2 years. yea he seems to always "pop" up when i start to get happy. he showed up at rehearsal last night and all i wanted to do was cry. i think part of it was because for a split second i almost wished i was still in his arms but i know thats not a good idea. i really wish aaron would date me but i don't think thats going to happen. i'm dying my hair "Plum" tomorrow. and les mis opens in a little over a week. but we go back to school next wednesday.tear. jen has to work tonight, court and britt are going to a concert so i'm alone. so there's a good chance i'll be back later.

      i'm not mad at court anymore...or aaron.aaron finally stopped ignoring me. in fact he was joking around like he use to. oh yea i went to the doctor friday...i have a viral infection, an ulcer on my tonsil, and laryngitis. fun fun especially when les mis opens in 2 weeks. so yeah my doctor put me on some antibotics and now i spend most of my time trying not to puke on myself.

      and the soap opera continues...apparently jenna talked to aaron the night he took court home. she told him that i have feelings for him and that he really hurt me. and he told her he didn't know if he liked me or not. and then monday night i asked him if he liked court. and the conversation was over...and then he called me at 1 in the morning to ask if there was another reason i asked. so i told him i liked him and he was like well like i said i have other options and he was gonna think about it. well last night at rehearsal he didn't so much as look at me. so i guess h's thinking no.  oh yea and on top of that i lost my voice at rehearsal last night and now i sound like minnie mouse and my throat hurts. stupid throat who needs it anyway. its kinda like my heart...smashed into the ground.

      who needs enemies with friends like mine...maybe i'm just a loser. but i'm about to be a loser with one less friend. have you ever had someone pick your friend over you? i have&nbsp; not once or twice but...6 times...ah yes the beauty of being the "sweet" one. everyone feels like they can walk all over you and you won't mind. or "you'll take it better". geez and people wonder why i don't like civilization. this should be a hint. i might as well run head first into a wall. there's always the convent if it came down to it though.&nbsp; maybe what i need to do is look for guys outside my circle of friends. hmm i think everyone in my group's picked someone over me anyways. oh yea and the friend list u can now ignore the court part and hell if you want forget aaron too. put dustin in their place. and brian even though he keeps refering to me as "biscuit" but thats a story for a happier day. and today isn't happy today is pissed off. chris just told me that apparently aaron likes court even though he was thinking about dating me. how the hell does that happen this many times. chris did that to me twice. and then he decided to tell me he was in love with my best friend. yea my life is great...really. i told you it was a soap opera. yea so now i'm pissed at court and aaron well lets just say i'm about to be done with aaron. drew says he feels bad that this keeps happening to me..even though he's the one that started it a couple months ago. so i think i have somewhat of a right to blame him. he was the first to pick jenna over me. then aaron with julissa and now court, chris followed w/amanda and then becca. and i'm sure there's someone else that did it i just don't remember who right now. hmm...oh yea josh he liked court more too. its sad when you consider ditching all of your friends so that it won't hurt as much when a guy picks them over you. as for court...lets just say i'm done. i've felt sorry for her long enough. i never realized how badly it would hurt though until i saw aaron taking court home. i guess i'll go ahead and end this before i start to cry again.

      Yeah so Jenna and Courtney are back...wow...who knows what can happen when parents are out of town...lets see saturday night everyone went to dustin's but me and jen went to a movie w/her sister so we only stayed at dustin's for like 20 minutes and after the movie we went back but i got pissed and we left(long story) but from what i've been told aaron ran around dustin's backyard naked&nbsp;w/slick chasing after him.last night was aaron's house. aaron got naked and ran around his house(maybe you're seeing a pattern).&nbsp; well chris's and aaron's parents are gone for the next week...fun fun...

      haha i'm back again. this is what happens when your friends leave you for a week at the beach. you sit around and end up doing odd things. jenna and court have spent the last week at the beach. but thats okay cuz that gave me and britt time to hang out...with the guys. chris got back from the bahamas saturday, drew got back from gulf shores on saturday. so for a little while it was just me, britt, aaron, and dustin. it was definitely an interesting few days. maybe i should explain that in about a month most of them are leaving me for college.tear. yea lets see britt, chris, drew and aaron start college this fall and dustin goes back to college. so that leaves me, jen, and court. jen graduates this year, i graduate the next year leaving poor court to get through her last year by herself. i would normally be at walmart, usually with aaron, by now but aaron's sick so i'm sitting home watching some odd soap opera waiting for him to get home from the doctor. woohoo now people are starting to get online. but anyway back to what i was saying...aaron, walmart..haha they use to have dolphins that had sex at wally world. that was quality entertainment. no i'm not some sick twisted pervert it was just one of those you never thought you'd see things...so in case you hadn't i informed you that they do in fact exist. maybe i should tell you that i hit my head about a month ago and i tend to forget what i'm saying. haha it was funny how it happened though. picture this...we thought we were smart so we were gonna get on each others backs, so jack gets on slicks back and i got on jacks..slick lost his balance and we fell backwards...and i landed on my head. it was definitely an interesting day...i almost puked in chris's car, chris told me if i died he was gonna kill slick and then kill himself, i guess it was one of those you had to be there things...well i guess i'll go now and find something to do...but i'll be back..dun dun dun

      A little while after i posted my last "comment" i got a phone call from the director of les mis...asking me for chris's number because the guy that plays marius was in a car accident and didn't think he could do it...so we were switching parts around...so we all freaked about that all day..and when the director called me all he said was it screwed up his face so i was crying and really worried about him but i talked to him that night and i felt alot better about it...so after school yesterday a bunch of us end up at the arts center and we find out that josh(the guy in the wreck) was going to do the part. so the show wasn't "too" bad last night. tonight is another happy "performance" only 3 left.

      well...noah's alright...and we resume performing tomorrow night...without a pick up rehearsal which seems like a mistake to me...my throat is rather "sexy" now. i have blisters on my throat and on my tongue...i ended up getting into the motlow class so i had to change my schedule around. so now i have drew's aunt first period and the only reason she let me in was cuz i'm friends with drew. i spent 10 minutes talking to the guidance counselor about shopping at goodwill yesterday..that was amusing.i ate a cough drop this morning and i started spazing cuz it hurt my throat so much.oh yea and apparently aaron still isn't sure if he wants to date me...how long does it take to decide if you want to freaken date someone? anyways...i guess i'll go ahead and go away but i'll be back...

      i thought opening night's "accident" was bad...yesterday the show was going alright no big catastrophes and then i hear this not so right sound but i don't pay too much attention until i see warren run up on stage and then i realize the barricade had gone over the front of the stage...so a guy jumps off the barcade in the middle of the show and starts pushing it back on, a bunch of people in costume run on stage to start pulling it back. as we're pulling it noah...our stage manager and basically the whole tech crew got his foot ran over by the barricade and so did stephanie...my skirt got caught under the barricade so julissa's mom had to run out there to try to get my skirt free. so we got the barricade back and the music kept messing up. and then i go out to sing "turning"...and i start crying...i look for a chair that me and noah take out in the last scene and i can't find it so i start cussing at kenny and i scare him pretty good...haha. sorry anyways we got through the end of the show and later on i find out that steph will be fine and noah was suppose to go to the doctor today but i haven't talked to him yet. oh yea i went into yesterday's show feeling horrible and then last night i was up half the night puking and then i overslept this morning so i only had like 10 minutes to get ready and fly to school. now my stomach is swollen and i look fat/pregnant. not very attractive. but what are you gonna do...

      so yeah...i went to put in an application for a motlow class this morning...and the class was full.so i'm on the waiting list even though my gpa and act score are higher then the people in the class. yea yea the world hates me. les mis opens thursday and lets just say i'm nervous about that...the music is sloppy..i can't figure out my freaken music cue in one song. i have to go to school tomorrow for 2 hours..stupid school. the first full day is friday. haha my voice keeps breaking which is just beautiful since tonight is the last rehearsal before we open.jenna left me at the arts center again last night..the second time in less than a week.that kinda pissed me off. but oh well i might as well get over it. i got invited to join in the "happy ultimate frisbee game" today but i have a feeling i'm gonna pass it up.  frisbee's great i'm just not in the mood to go watch it since i'm a gimp and i can't run and play. haha but thats okay cuz matt invited me even though i'm "closer" to drew, chris,and i guess aaron even though he's been having worse mood swings than a woman lately. oh well i guess i'm off since jen wants me to go to wally world with her...

      les mis opens thursday...agghh...we go back to school wednesday...tear...but any who...i went to the movies friday night to see the village. or atleast me,jen,britt, and julissa oh yea and noah went to see it. if you haven't seen it you prolly should.interesting movie. 'specially when you keep getting texts from people who aren't there. haha we had to split up when we got there cuz there weren't enough seats together. so jen sat with jon, britt and noah sat together and that left me and julissa so we were sitting together and i'm pretty sure we had most of the people around us convinced we were on a date. then i almost wrecked my brother's car..that would have been a sad day in tellatubby land. yesterday me and britt went to see jen at work...lol then we sat at courtney's house talking to her mom for a couple hours. i got a text from aaron while we were there asking if&nbsp;me,jen,britt, and court&nbsp;wanted to come over and watch a movie with him and chris. but jen was at work and court was with her grandparents. me and britt were gonna go by but we lost track of time and when i realized what time it was i was suppose to have been home 10 minutes before. then i talked to chris and he told me how him and aaron had sat outside burning things waiting for us to get there. so i felt kinda bad.but atleast aaron's talking to me again.
