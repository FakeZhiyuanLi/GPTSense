      I need to quit spending time with my best friend. He is like a vicious manipulative beast that forces his worthless knowledge on you. When he is finished with you you will be able to recognize all White Wolf game symbols on site and your thirst for horror will be something that even the Wolfman couldn't sate. And all of that is fine but the motherfucker has gone too fucking far! I took another test.   Timelord .  urlLink       Well, you are definitely a fan, but not as obsessed as some. Don't worry, that's a good thing.   Lord help, and I don't mean a time one. Jeremy made this quiz and I enjoyed it but I knew way too many of the answers (at least that's how I felt). Though if you are a fan do so yourself and we can all be losers together.

      Just took another of the old OKCupid's tests and did well for myself. Of course I realize it is just a test and I shouldn't get too excited but I need a little ego boost to make it through the day.   Here what it says about me.   Bangable .   slightly rebellious, flirtatious, ingraspable.... & yet you are entirely bangable. you are shrewd in your dealing with others only b'cuz it may hinder your chance for more freedom... of sexual liasons, of thought, of roaming the land. therefore you are the perfect bang.    urlLink     This was a happy thing to learn. It also said this.   Of the users who took the test and are male, straight, and in your age group, 100% scored lower than you did.  Heh, sweet...

      Who knew waking up by noon would be a challenge worthy of Fear Factor? I have to do something about this sleeping late thing. I was doing good before, when I got back from Canada. Now I have no clue how I am going to be able to awake early enough for mornings in Fall.

       Little One   Is she talking about my dude? If so I'll have her know that I am proudly average. Anyway took another test,'The are you a SOUL FUCKER Test'. And I am not a soul fucker, though I think my Ani Difranco answer didn't help. Anyway this is what it said when I won...I mean finished and scored 73%.   urlLink     "Based on the trivial information gathered from this assesment I could date you, but I doubt I would ever truely love you. We could however be good friends, which is in so many senses sooooo much better."  For all eternity I shall be dubbed "Little One" ...uh,  fuck .

      I've taken this test many times and now I've come up as something new. Has my life changed so dramatically that I have become another person? I dunno. I guess it is just an online test.  I've been thinking a lot about my personality and the things I want to change about it. I guess I came to realise the other night with a friend that I don't want to change who I am, but just the little things that I find negative about me. It's not disliking myself, which I do a lot, but more of a focused progress. Does that make sense?  Anyway here are my results:   urlLink OKcupid test results for 'paperclipmaker'   I'll probably take it again, I always do.

      (sigh) How come I never get to my blog when I'm feeling a little less.   Anyway, I'm here now and Whitney Houston is blasting on the stereo downstairs. God I love her voice. I wonder why she is with Bobby. It's seems that ever since she married him she has gone down hill.   I know that there are men out there like that. They have so much chaos and self injury in their lives that they can only drag those around them into their pain. Moth to a flame type thing.   Ehh...I guess I've been thinking about relationships right now.

      I have aquired a new roommate. It is a kitten of incredibly small size. She also has only one working eye at the momment. She might have been born that way. When I heard about her I knew that I wanted her. Actually, I don't even know if it is a her. I have an appointment with the Vet tommorrow and she is going to look at her eye and tell me her sex.  She doesn't have a name at this time but it will come.

      I started moving on Thursday.  &nbsp;  The apartment on the end opened up. I had always wanted to move into one of those if one of them became available. It happened. Now I will have my own bedroom instead of just an open space.  &nbsp;  Zac and I dominate the downstairs area. It is decorated with many posters and such. I like that it is cooler, as in temperature, and that we have our own entrance. It has a lot of work that needs done on it. Our last place was definitely in better shape but&nbsp;I like the idea of working on it.  &nbsp;  Zac's room is a lot like my old room as in that it isn't a bedroom but more of a living room. It also has a gas fireplace, sweet huh!  &nbsp;  Tavish is in the same room and he hasn't change his setup at all. Banality at it's finest. There is a spare room where Zac's use to be. We are looking for a roommate to fill that. Then rent should be pretty sweet. In talks with Jer but he likes to hide his feelings about such things. Hmmm...  &nbsp;  Well, as soon as I get everything settled, tomorrow or the next day, I'll have to see what I am going to do about a barbecue.

      Being a grow up is very difficult. Today I received two text messages from Liz. The first on reads:   We are having a hard time today   This was probably sent to me before she left for work. Later, much later actually, I received another.   She has cried from 8 in the morning till now this is really hard   Of course I called her after each of these to see what was up, anything she might need. You see my daughter is teething, bad. When I saw her last I could get her to smile and I would see the teeth just under the gums. She'll probably have two teeth by the end of the week. She is having a hard time with this, just as Liz had said. Of course this will pass and she will have no memories of it but it difficult for a parent none the less.  Liz is doing an amazing job as a mother. Nobody in this world could do better. I owe her everything and one day when the world is mine, I will give it to her. She raises my daughter like it was her only purpose in life, something that very few do anymore. I envy her, I wish I could do the same.

      Late last night I had the chance to witness something beautiful.  I watched Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence.  Those who know me will realize this is a big deal in my life. I can sit and talk with anyone for hours about the manga and anime versions of this story. Innocence is still in the theater in Japan. Though it was played at Cannes Film Festival it won't be getting a very big theater release here in America. So, a friend found it online and I got the chance to watch it last night. Wow. My Japanese in little to none, but I like to think that I got the majority of the story.  It may be days before I get to watch it with a fan sub but I feel like I experienced it. Now it is a matter of filling the holes. I know it isn't an adaptation of Man Machine Interface. I finished that a few days ago and it seems to be a completely different story. This is more Oshii than Shirow.
