      My nice sister-in-law, Lynn, and I made a pact this week. See, we compared notes and found out that Brown Cow has been trashing both of us behind our backs. It appears that we're responsible for a whole myriad of sins that our respective husbands have committed. These include such oversights as gaining a bit of weight, not pursuing one's parental-given talents in the visual arts, and/or not choosing to forego all personal vacation plans for the supreme fun of joining the Cow and Henry for the whoop-de-family-reunion in Boringavia this summer.  At the very least, Brown Cow wants the boys to write up a short biographical sketch which will showcase just what a paragon of a mother she's been here in the New World. Right. And that's going to happen riiiight  now .  So the pact is that we're simply not going to grace any more of Brown Cow's bullshit with a legitimate response. She starts trashing Lynn to Aldo and me, and we're duty-bound to stop her. Vice-versa also. No defending against any allegations, as we've all done in the past. After all, most of her accusations are so stupid they don't even deserve the dignity of a response -  any  sort of response.  Treat them with the dismissiveness they deserve. The trashing may not go away, but at least we're not a part of it anymore. And we won't have to listen to that shit.  After all, I can't honestly say I care much about what Brown Cow thinks; I just don't want to deal with the aftermath of her stupid gossip.

      This is the journal nobody I know is supposed to see. It's like the Lambada - the phoney baloney dance no one was doing ten years ago when it was alleged to be popular. If that Dave Letterman reference jogs your memory, you'll probably be able to guess my age, within five years or so, anyway. Except this thing is supposed to allow me to talk about the things I don't discuss in my other "legitimate" journal. In other words, no phoney baloney. Oh, my, lucky you.  Is my name Claudine? Fuck, no. That's a damn pretty name, though, don't you think?  Lately my mother has gone somewhat berserk. I love her. She's a really interesting person and, sometimes, a good mother. Still, she's crazy as a loon. And I should know. I live in Canada, and we have loons here. Especially in Regina, which is where I live. I didn't just pick that town because it has a funny name (well, pronunciation of the name).  With only one crazy parent, I'm way ahead of my spouse, though. His mother is a bully galore, and his father is totally pussy-whipped. I used to call him "hen-pecked," but now my nice sister-in-law has latched on to the word "pussy-whipped," and, somewhat unfortunately, that's become completely lodged in my brain.  The punchline is that poor Hen-pecked Henry insists that both his daughters-in-law are complete bullies who run their men ragged. Boo-fucking-hoo. I'm sure that's just what his wife is telling him to say.  For reasons too lengthy to get into right now, I'm going to call my husband Aldo. And I'm going to call Aldo's mother Brown Cow. I have to tell you the story behind that one, though.  Aldo was raking leaves once with his brother. Since they were 7 years old at the time, I guess they weren't being quite efficient enough. Yeah! They were 7, okay? Aldo's mom came out and started chastizing them for, you know, not being efficient enough. Aldo got so pissed that he wanted to yell at her with some sort of insult. However, the only thing that came to his 7-year-old's head was to call her a "Brown Cow." Means nothing, right? That still didn't stop her from beating him.  More later.

      I'm Claudine. This is my blog.  Can you believe how few blogs have the phrase "train wreck" associated with them? I was pretty surprised myself, though I really shouldn't be. It's usually  other  people that apply that phrase to them.  Honestly, who wants to think her own life is a train wreck?

      I get to have lunch with the Cow and Hen-pecked Henry (H2) this weekend. Woo! Yeah! Uch.  Sigh. Yeah, uch.  It's been a while, so for that I'm grateful. Also, I'm grateful for the fact that Aldo has seen the 'rents already since their return from Boringavia and has been subject to all the photographic  boredom   excitement that the ol' family reunion entailed.  Now that all the gratefulness is taken care of, though, can I mention how annoyed I am that they're back in town? And, obviously, that I have to see them, unfortunately, in a setting that does not involve cream pies being thrown on their annoying faces, all  Three's Company  '70s sitcom-style.  I was all prepared to let everything go on longer -- much, much longer -- before I'd have to see them. But now it's all ruined.  I've been trying to get Lynn and Aldo all hooked on the joys of lying. That's kind of ironic, really.  At the start of our relationship, I was all about making Aldo  not  lie to me. Well, duh, you don't want your boyfriend lying to you. Right? Well, now I think I might have done a better job than I expected because, well, I'm having lunch with the loathed in-laws tomorrow.  Don't get me wrong. I still want a spouse who treats me with the same respect with which I treat him. But I'd kind of like him to use his old-school lying skills on the parents. After all, it's not like Aldo has to even expend any effort with that. The 'rents are not sophisticated enough to cope with even the most rudimentary of lies.  I mean, how hard would it have been to say that we're vacationing on Mars this weekend?
