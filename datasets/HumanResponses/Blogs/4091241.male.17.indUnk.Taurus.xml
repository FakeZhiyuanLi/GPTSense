       urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/Beware.jpg  I looked at the paper yesterday(as usual), and ended up reading a story about Americans suing people (as usual). But this story had a twist. It seemed that a 17 year old guy (Warren Leblanc) had killed a 14 year old (Stefan Pakeerah)with a claw hammer and knife, after luring him to a park (with candy and puppies, probably).  Who’s to blame you ask? “Lebanc of course!” you may say. But no. This case has more to it than you may think. This case has roots…..sinister roots…… it is linked to the devil’s will that is….THE GAMING INDUSTRY. As Detective Duke delved more and more into the 1/3rd of a page article, he read that this bloodthirsty killing machine was in fact, an innocent little boy, who fell into the abyss that is the warped world of games. I, however, prefer to call him an idiot.  The reason the Leblanc killed Pakeerah was because he had become obsessed with the game Manhunt.  urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/ItsHim.jpg  Despite what the media is telling people, Manhunt has no scoring system. This on it’s own tells us that they couldn’t have bothered their ass to actually play the game before trying to liquidate Rockstar Games, the game’s developer. Despite this, they were right that you have to kill people to play the game. It’s the whole point of the game. That’s why it’s rated 18. Not 15, not 17. If the game was rated 18, then it must mean that Rockstar officials, dressed in black, trapped this poor boy to a chair, sellotaped his eyelids open, and forced him to watch footage of the game, before giving him thorough lessons on how to kill someone. I mean, how else could he know that hitting someone with a hammer and stabbing them with a knife would kill them? It must be the game! Or maybe it’s the fact Leblanc was a dumbass who decided to kill Pakeerah because he saw someone else doing it. In which case, better keep him away from TVs, couldn’t have him watching the news and going off to bomb a building or something. If he is allowed to see it, he WILL go and do it, right? That’s what we’re being told. Idiot see, idiot do.  On a more serious note now people. I’ll try my best to ignore the fact that the monkey offed someone of his own free will and it’s Rockstar’s fault.  Other things that could have been done to prevent this: ·Supervision. Leblanc’s mom or dad could have bothered their ass to look at what he was playing, saw how incredibly violent it was, acted like a parent and taken the game away from him. ·Investigation. If the parents saw how much he was playing it (and it takes a LOT of play time to be obsessed with a game, unless you find it so interesting you live your life by it the second you see it, in which case you need to join a cult), and asked his friends if he was having problems or something like that. ·Exploration. Leblanc could have read Nintaldo’s post and realised that if it’s not Nintendo, it’s nothing. ·Medical Help. Leblanc’s friends (or anyone paying attention) could have realised that he was unstable, and told of his concerns to his parents, getting him the help he needs. ·Professional Pride: The people who sold him the game could have expelled a life-altering syllable and said ‘No’. It’s rated 18 for a reason.  But alas, people go for the easy way out and blame the richest, most vulnerable suspect of all, the gaming industry. Suing Rockstar won’t change the fact that these games are fun, and this will happen again (watch your back, Punisher). But suing the parents of the murderer will, as will locking him away, of suing the game shops and have them clean up their act.  So, once again, the gaming industry is under unjustified fire. As the global IQ drops and drops, these things will happen more and more often. But hey, at least they found the culprit this time- the guy who made Tetris never faced charges for encouraging teens to drop bricks onto cars from bridges.  Remember everyone:  urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/IdleHands2.jpg   EDIT: In the end, that whore (Pakeerah's mam) sued SONY (What the hell?) for 50 MILLION DOLLERS! Christ, Sony just make the console, not the game! Dumb bitch put a price on her son's life. I would encourage and appriciate people who agree that games do not make killers to sign this petition to have the Daily Mail (The paper that made this bullshit famous) banned. I did it, all I got was a thank you email. It's genuine, no spam. Thanks!  (All characters and game titles portrayed in images and text belong to their respective copyright)

       Headline: IQ of innocent internet browsers plummeting, fanboy at fault!       You can find the offending page here:  urlLink http://tendomfg.blogspot.com/  After reading his posts of Halo2 and FPS in general, I decided to entertain myself by replying in a more public and direct way. 'Hook, line and sinker, fool.' you may think. Of course, you're right! But then again, someone has to kick this clowns ass. First off, I used to be a PS2 fanboy. Using empty, thoughtless arguments to defend my idiot and biased opinions that I had never thought about. Then, I was invited by a friend to play Halo with our friends. I now have an Xbox, with many good games in my collection. I am also now thinking of getting a GameCube.Back to another idiotic, biased fanboy. Nintaldo's post mainly consist of changing the names of popular non-Nintendo games to denounce them. "Gaylo, you say?! I would never buy a game so easily made fun of! I'm going to run off and buy a Nintendo! No wait, I'm gonna buy a (wait for it....) GOLDEN NINTENDO!! OMFG! It comes with a copy of Mario Party!!!11!!!!!1!!!one!". Holy shit, I think I just came. Mission accomplished, Nintaldo. Onto Halo2 then. "Bungie made Marathon, which is dumb ". Well, Nintendo made Mario into a 3d game, forever tarnishing his legend and devaluing an icon by making shitty games.  "Master Chief is a boring character that never talks ". The Master Chief is a ruthless war machine fighting for the fate of makind, and talks frequently.  "Halo 2 has not ghosts ". It is a well known fact that if ghosts and dumbass grammatical errors are not in a game, it is not even worth pissing on. But Halo does have ghosts:  urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/Halo_Ghosts.jpg   "Geist lets players control other bodies ". Having the ability to play as other bodies in a game adds different perspectives to a story. Another alternative is to build up one single strong body, and make him a likeable body, so the players won't care that they only have on body to control. On another note altogether, multiple characters are a plus in games.  "Geist is made by the same developers that made Mary Kate & Ashlee: Magical Mystery Mall ". Unlike Halo, all Mary Kate and Ashley games are made by people wanting to bring value to the games market, have a lot of work put into them, and are not just a quick buck. We should all sell our soles to keep companies like this on their feet.  "Halo 2 is GAY ". Another AIR-HEADED and INANE post by this RETARDED waster of web space.  "Geist is a more pure first person game. Halo 2 has stupid stuff like two guns controllings and vehicles. Is it a fps or a stupid racing game? Geist is pure 100% shooter! ". I think I'm gonna let you kick your own ass this time: "FPS games are boring.", "No FPS ever created has ever been innovative", "where's the adventure?", "FPS games don't offer the varities of gameplay that other genres do. ". Smooth like butter.  "Geist looks better than Halo 2 ". Doubtful. Everyone knows that the Xbox has the highest graphical power out of the 3 current selling consoles. I myself don't give a shit about how games look.  Here's a gem. "Geist doesn't have stupid online play. Online play is just a fad. Nintendo said so themselves."    urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/NintendoEgo2.jpg   "I mean who wants to play online like some PC nerd? I know I don't. Plus Xbox Live has lots of lag. My friend's friend told me that his Xbox caught on fire once. ". I know what you mean. I was playing Yuri's Revenge on my PC the other day, and was purposely setting kids on fire, by bringing them into my high speed matches that their computers couldn't keep up with. You're friends Xbox caught on fire because your friend was too blind to see that he wasn't giving his Xbox enough ventilation. That and he's an idiot. At least he knows a good console when he sees one. Online play? That sucks. You know what doesn't? Hauling furniture around, setting up multiple power supplies to one room, and bitching at my friends to bring over controllers and consoles to my place so we can have a worthwhile multiplayer game session.  "Geist sounds cooler than Halo! ". A halo is the symbol of goodness, and is the golden ring above an angel's head. What the hell is a geist?  "PonyhayStation Goo and Xbomb fans cry away, GameCube is here to stay". Gaylube. DOOMED. Way-low. Shame-o Sicks. Ninja Gay-den. Have I earned your respect?

      Mario. Sonic. Zelda. I weep for you.  Like the music industry, the world of gaming is hardly what it used to be. Now, good games are rendered asunder buy utter sell out shit. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, Westlife, Sabrina, Samuri Jack, Simpsons,  Futurama, to name a few, are games made for the sake of making a game. Only idiots buy this shit. Dumbass kids who should listen to their older brothers who actually know about games before goading their parents into buying this shit. Formula for lots of money and disgrace to gamers everywhere: Shit game+ famous face+ idiots= Jackpot.  Sonic used to be great. So did Mario. Sonic ran real fast, has shields and stuff, and great characters. With a unique style of gaming, Sonic was a legend. Now, look at Sonic Heroes. Blatent use of the characters,put in a shit game. If Sonics blue spikey face wasn't on that cover, that game would never have gone anywhere. Same for all the new Mario games. If the fat plumber didn't star in these dry platformers, it would never have sold a copy. It's not a mario game. That's just a disgrace to Mario's origional ground breaking gameplay.  Please, stop making these games.

      Music. Turn on your radio. What do you hear? Not music. You hear repetitive and computerised sounds, clashing and whirring over and over again while some some guy (usually black) talks quickly, and there's an off chance of a woman in the back wailing to add more annoying sound. This is the shit I have to put up with everyday. R+B, rap, techno, dance. AKA shit.  What happened to  music ? Instruments! Singing! Emotional creations! They're all pretty much gone. While there is still many bands out there that produce good music (Franz Ferdinand, QOTSA, Radiohead, Muse, Mew, to name a few), they have been drowned in a sea of idiots shitting on about themselves. Music was origionally (and still is) suppossed to be a form of art. Expressing oneself in another way. You feel sad, you make a sad song, people listen to it and understand because they feel bad at times too. Now, it's all about getting something on the air, getting jack rich from it, and mostly, it's about the image. With the exception of Eminem (who still writes about real stuff that happened to him), pretty much all of the aforementioned music is soulless and bland. I can't remember the last time a new song was timeless. All the crap out these days will be dead and gone soon enough, only to be heard again in a tribute to their creator when they die from ODing.  I miss Led Zepplin, G&R, Jimi Hedrix, and Oasis. I will never miss Beyonce. (Speaking of which, I havn't heard a song by her in a while. Guess people already got tired of her.)  Poor music. I weep for you.  (Hello to readers once again. My internet broke for a while but I'm back once again, telling it as I see it. Grammer and correct spellings come free, as always.)

      Well, it seems that the threads of the Manhunt Sham weave a bigger web then first thought!  You can find my earlier Manhunt post here:  urlLink http://cycloneduke.blogspot.com/2004/07/manhunt-sham.html   In police investigation, it was revelealed that Warren Leblanc (psycho murderer) never even had the game. Police say that the most probable motive was money, a drug deal gone wrong. American+drugs+easy way out = trouble and a bigass lawsuit  You can find the reports here:  urlLink http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=pub&amp;aid=3918   urlLink http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/04/manhunt_murder_claim/   Will add pics as I find time and inspiration!

       urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/BestGame2.jpg  Final Fantasy 7. An RPG, the 7th in it's series. Developed by Squaresoft (now merged with another company to become SquareEnix), and launched on the PlayStation in 1997. Hailed by many people (who can think) as the best game ever made. I have played many many RPGs, and tons of other games of course, but no game I have ever seen can hold a candle to FF7. Why?  Multiple reasons. ·Story: Much better than that crappy Bible (best story ever told my ass!). The story is very imaginative, with each character being interesting and having their own story to tell. As status quo for all (good) RPGs, the story is the most important contributing factor the all-over game. A simple story of revenge at the start, but it unfolds into something much bigger, with many plot twists.  ·The Ability Learning System: The ALS in FF7 is another thing that takes FF7 above all other RPGs. The materia system uses AP to level up each piece of materia equipped to the fighting characters. All characters can equip any materia they like, and each materia levels up to give stronger magic. Genius.  ·Length: Some games, you play for about one week and you’re finished. Unless this game has astonishing replay value, you just pissed your money down the drain. All FF games give at least 30 hours first time through.  ·Replay Value: Damn, there’s just so much to do in these games. In FF7 you have Ruby and Emerald Weapon to kill, flyers to collect, chocobos to breed, and materia to find. Never gets tiring.  ·Graphics: The one and only low point in the game. The cast look terrible while on the field. Square blocks for hands…ugghh… However, all is fine in battles and in cutscenes. If you remember one thing while playing FF7, it’s that fat chicks need love too.  Now onto my favourite part, ripping the piss out of fanboys. Once again, today we are picking on someone from "TendOMFG". After asking what they thought of the Final Fantasy series, MarioOMFG posted this :  urlLink http://tendomfg.blogspot.com/2004/08/top-10-reasons-why-final-fantasy-sucks.html  -the 10 tops reason why FF sucks….. not realising that FF was born and raised on the NES,SNES, and gameboy. FFCC is also a well selling new game on the Gamecube. Niiiiiiiiiiiice. Let’s take a look at this list.  “10. Yay, let's stand around and hit a menu so the idiots fight! I mean, you can't even jump and butt-stomp at monsters. What kind of idiocy is this?” It’s called a battle. Tends to be less repetitive than making a fat plumber jump on monsters, then jumping on another monster, then (here’s a badass change) jumping on a flying monster. FF employs Limit breaks, a wide variety of magic, different weapons, items… and so forth. A tad bit better than having your only means of attack your overweight ass.  “9. Random battles are stoopid. When i walk through fields in real life thinking about how awesome Reggie is, I don't run into stupid monsters. OMG!” Random battles add an element of surprise to the world map. And when I’m walking along drainpipe avenue thinking about how retarded fanboys are, I don’t run into walking turtles and oversized plants. OMG!  “8. So it's called FINAL.. so END IT ALREADY! LOL!” It’s called Super Mario Bros..so why aren’t they super!? ROFLMAO!!  “7. You can't scratch Wario's back in it.” This is another bad thing about the FF games. They rob me of the opportunity to scratch Wario’s back. Damn you SQUAAAAAARE!!!!  urlLink http://www.thankshey.com/picturefolder/23/SquareWario2.jpg   “6. Story? More like BORY! HAHA! Every game is stupid and dumb and boring because i say so.” This is the same tactic that Nintendo used to come up with Wario’s name. Says a lot, doesn’t it? Stories make you want to play a game. Notice that all games have stories, including one’s Reggie makes. Better go use your air-headed arguments to persuade him to boot storylines.  “5. Squaresoft is Square! (and soft!) lol” Squaresoft is a company, and is incapable of taking on shape, of texture. If the word square was used to mean uncool, it seems that your loosing your touch, and now are resorting to using out dated phrases to make a rhyme………..lol  “4. Reggie didn't mention Final Fantasy in the press conference, therefore it's dumb” I’m sure that Reggie (?) mentioned FF Crystal Chronicles in many press conferences leading up to the games release on the GAMECUBE, therefore you are dumb.  “3. Final Fantasy isn't about taking names” Yes it is. In Mario, you take someone’s name and then go to their castle to jump on them until their pixels stretch out, and they fall off the screen. In FF, you take someone’s name, chase them across the world, hunt them down to the centre of the earth, then slash them apart with impressive attacks.  “2. The game is too long. Who wants to play the same stupid game for 50 hours? lol!” I take it you suck at Mario because this is how long it takes to master the games. And it’s called (say it with me) ‘getting your money’s worth’  “1. NO MARIO!” Another downer. I enjoy making a fat guy with a shit job haul his sweaty unfit ass over scrolling screens with about 10 sound effects and songs to listen to while I do this. Damn you SQUAAAAAARE!!!!
