      I can't imagine a world without coffee, its 9:00 am 2 cups of coffee, the fog is starting to clear in my head. Trying to put off my responsibilities. I just want to keep on web surfing, and playing collaspe. Escape from another load of laundry,ah yuck another fun filled day! Here I go again,in robot mode. I think I'll blast the stereo get a little grove on. Ah, the beat of the drums so primal. My feet start to dance to there own choreography. Up Up in away in my beautiful balloon. Here I go to begin my day. See what this day will bring.

      I actualy got time on the computer in the middle of the day. Nobody needing me at the moment! Its so quiet right now, unbelievable. I LOVE IT. Well this blogging thing, I don't do it every day just no time. Does anyone care to know why. The list is endless. I have three kids easy enough to manage. Its all the other stuff. My father-in-law lives with us, who I adore he really is know problem. He just keeps me even busier with he's needs, Dr.'s appts. etc... If that isn't enough too My husband's sister moved in with us a year ago. She has terminal cancer. So I deal with her Dr.'s appts. Taking care of her needs. It sounds to unbelievable when I tell people. Most people blow me off, when I  rarely explain all this to those I thought would care to know. I think people are selfish, into their own world and dont' want to be bothered. Is it because they can't handle reality. The ugly side of life, like cancer. Or god forbid I might ask for help. This is what I think! I don't have the nerve to ask. So I second guess. On top of all of that I have M.S. (See I said its too unreal to believe) I have been dealing with that for the past 11 years. Still I count my blessing I'am not in a wheel chair yet. I truly try everyday to stay up beat. Some days its easier then others. My niece tells me all the time I'am going to have the most beautiful angel wings ever! For awhile now I have been saving up for a kickass tattoo of wings to be done on my back. I can't wait.

      I was reading differant blogs tonight and came across one in which this women spoke of her cousin who committed suicide. It was very moving. I began to wonder how many people have had a family member or friend that committed suicide. How many of us seriously think about actualy doing it too.                                           I personally have know a couple people who did it. When I was in 6th or 7th grade a favorite teacher I had committed suicide. She was so sweet all the kids liked her. It was so tragic her daughter found, she was really young too she was my age.         When I was older and meet my husband to-be he had a good friend who hung himself. I also knew the young man through school. At the time so many poeple who knew him stated that they had know idea that he was unhappy, what was going on inside him? It really is hard for me to understand how they never tell someone, anyone. Why they don't reach out for help? Or do they and know one is listening.                                                                                                            Today my daughter let me read some of her poems, she's 12 here is one I like                                                                                              I am an original You are not I don't follow the crowd You do I don't care what other people think of me You do I am an original You aren't.  My daughter also likes to write stories, she has one an award for them too. I am pretty proud of her! I have two sons also and they may drive me crazy at times but I am also very proud of them. I am truly lucky for having them. Being a parent I think is one of the hardest job we will ever do. I know alot of people who complain about how hard and don't see the reward in it. For me personaly it is watching them develope into individuals, and the unique person they are becoming.

      Another day has began. What will it bring? I was looking at my blog its title and everything,yuck! It seems so impersonal and almost robotic. I like the name, but the descibtion is so...   I have read other blogs, Some are set up so much better then mine more creative. It speaks more of who they are. I'am going to try and see if I can do something a little more like me. I would like to include pics, and other stuff I'am into. I wish I wrote more eloquently. Its seems so dictated. Kinda removed from myself boring! I wonder if anyone has read my blog? If so what is your opinion?  We just set up a above ground pool. Now the fun begins, keeping the damn chemicals balanced.  We got a puppy a month ago,a female who's part lab and german shepard her name is Tonia. She looks more lab then anything. Her personality really is starting to show. I wish I could afford to have more animals and more children for that matter kids, I must be  having a moment of insanity. Though I have enough love to go around, at this time to many things are agaisnt that. Well I started out wondering what today will bring, its going to be the same old shit another day in the life of a domestic engineer. I apologize for any grammtical errors.
