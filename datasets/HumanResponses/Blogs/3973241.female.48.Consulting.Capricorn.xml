      When you are looking at your summary one page, one thing that stands out in the components section at the top are any red numbers in the last column.  (PS if you still have the graphical version of Summary One - with bars instead of numbers on the COMPONENTS, let sarah.jury@elaura.com know and we can send you a replacement)  These REVERSALS are scores where your reactive behaviour - what happens when your underlying need isn't met - is likely to be the opposite of what we would expect if we knew what the need was. So for example, with an Esteem reversal, the person who needs direct communication becomes very evasive and indirect, or with an Authority reversal the person who needs easy going workplace relationships becomes domineering.   We'll write some blogs on specific reversals, but the starting point is to take these scores seriously.   Firstly, they are one more area where other people will misread you, and react in the wrong way. When you become evasive, they start treating you more and more diplomatically, which is the last thing you need - to get back into your usual productive behaviour, you need them to give you the plain unvarnished facts. The more they soft-pedal, the further into outer space you go.  And secondly - a reversal means that under stress you are directly harming yourself. The more you behave in the opposite mode to your underlying need, the further you are pushing what you need away from yourself. Ouch!  So what to do? Look at your Usual and Needs scores. If they are close together or at least the same side of 50 (both high or both low) then by focussing on behaving in your Usual style, you will be helping meet your underlying need.   It is a little harder when your Usual score is opposite to your Needs (and the same side of 50 as your Reversal). That is a score where both your Usual and Stress behaviours do nothing for your Needs, and also where you and other people may find it hard to distinguish what is normal and what is stress. I would make sure two or three people close to you at work and home understand your scores in this area and the importance of meeting the underlying need. They may be able to do for you what you cannot do yourself - for example, sticking with our Esteem reversal, by telling you what the situation is in clear and direct terms, and establishing the parameters for you. "Yes there is a problem, got to fix it, not the end of the world or even your job."  Elaura - take your people to the top

      Does your Needs marker (the circle) sit close to the centre of the Life-Style Grid? if it does then the needs page in your report will simply say something like "You are most comfortable when other people avoid extremes".   Now that need can be a great asset in keeping a diverse group together. You will tend to rein in those who go to an extreme, which will be a blessing for those whose needs lie at the diagonally opposite extreme.   On the other hand - you put a value on "balance" that is not self-evident to others. While the word itself is a motherhood statement - it is hard to argue against some balance - not everyone feels comfortable with balance any more than you feel comfortable with extremes. You may well find that you surround yourself with other "balanced" people... and like any tendency, that can have some negative results.  And of course you should be aware that you may be saying "caution" when "action" is what is in fact required. There may be times when your love of balance is the last thing your organisation needs. In fact we work with one organisation where the entire six-person senior management group are Central Needs. That happens to be appropriate for the kind of work they are doing - they are a non-profit working on family issues - so balance (versus any kind of instability) is actually very positive for them, both viz a vis their clients and as a key element of their organisational culture. It still makes it challenging sometimes when they know that something approaching a radical decision has to be made.  So if you are a "Centrist", make sure you have a few extremists around you  - people whose Usual and Needs scores are well away from the middle of the grid. Let them each have a say on a regular basis, and learn to say something like "I don't feel comfortable - but I can see the logic / feel the passion and we had better move on this..."

      We are setting up this blog as a fast way to get Birkman Method insights up on the web for our clients. All the time we find that issues come up in the context of individual or group feedbacks which are widely applicable. Come back here often to see what we are up to. I've included the Birkman URL because there is now a growing body of research material up there - definitely worth a look when you have time.

      Got someone with  Blue Needs  (the circle on the Life-Style Grid) in your  Virtual Team ? Oh dear!  Blue Needs people need - above all else - a sense of connection. Some will love working in groups, some will choose to work on individual assignments - but don't be fooled, even the Blue Needs person who really seems to prefer their own company needs to feel connected to something larger, and to receive support from that group or at least key individuals within it.   This isn't to say that Blue Needs and Virtual Teams can't work - but it takes extra work. If you can establish genuine team identity and a sense of mutual care and support, then that Blue Needs person will feel at home even in a Virtual Team. But if Virtual also means impersonal, and if work - rather than how team-members are doing - is the constant focus, expect that Blue Needs person to either go ballistic or go AWOL, sooner or later.

      A little exercise we sometimes do with teams is to find someone with a very Green profile (or at least a Green Usual -the diamond- Style), and get them to try selling a holiday in a foreign destination to someone who is very Yellow (or at the least Yellow in their Needs -the circle).  Green people tend to enthuse; they are thinking competitive advantage and USPs (unique selling propositions), and expect their hearers to do the same. After they have gone on for a few minutes we stop them and ask the Yellow person, "is this meeting your needs? Are they answering the questions you haven't yet had a chance to ask?" Invariably the answer is "No!" So we discuss what those questions are, and then ask the Green to start again. Some of them become amazingly tongue-tied to start with, but are often astonished by how quickly they can adapt.  Green people live in the NOW; Yellow people on the other hand regard the PAST as an excellent indicator of future performance. They want to know what they can expect, based on the experience of others. So whereas the Green person may think that the chance to be the first to try out the NEW ultramodern facilities or go somewhere that Westerners have never yet visited is terribly compelling, the Yellow person would rather place their holiday bet on something proven.  Of course, the point here applies much more generally than just selling holidays. In an organisation, there are many people you may carry with you on the basis of the excitement of the new and the untried; but the Yellows won't be among them. And there is some safety there; the most successful new ideas in the short and medium term are generally those that are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, so the discipline of finding examples of how your idea builds on a lot of proven successes can keep you from trouble.  There is a wider and more profound point as well, and that is encapsulated in the fact that the Green person can try adapting their style to meet the Yellow person's needs. Whatever our profile, once we understand another person's Needs, we can adapt our Usual Style to meet those Needs.   Asking people to suspend their Needs in order to accommodate our Usual behaviour is a non-starter, albeit the way most of us operate by default. If we used Birkman ONLY to understand the Needs of those we communicate with, it would still deliver a huge return on our investment...  Elaura - take your people to the top

      Blue people (ie with one or more markers in the Blue Quadrant on the life-style grid, but especially those with 3/4 Blue markers) tend to be very ideas oriented. Of course, ideas and execution can be two different things. Here is an example that just came up in conversation, which I have heard in various forms on numerous occasions from Blues.   "I'd love to have my own business." That's great. But worth checking which you love - the  idea  of having a business, or the  reality  of running one. Plenty of Blues do run businesses, and very successfully, but there are things those who are strongly Blue find particularly onerous. Admin is one. That's Yellow. Selling is another. That's Green. Finishing one job before starting the next - that's Red.   Getting someone in to help with Admin is an easy starting point for a Blue entrepreneur, and often that person will be more of a "getting things done" person, so that can help with the Red side of things. It can be a little harder to solve the Selling issue, because in a small business start-up, if the owner isn't selling, the business is unlikely to last (it is a matter of conviction - if the owner doesn't believe in the product enough to sell it, who will?). In other words, finding someone to get on the phones or knock the doors isn't going to be the whole solution even if it is possible.  What is the answer? Play to your strengths, of course. What do strongly Blue people do well? They build one-to-one relationships, for a start. The sense of connection matters at lot to Blues, so they are often wonderful at building a network of individual friends. Secondly, Blues tend to be great at supporting roles, so if you can find a business that puts you in that context viz a vis your customers (whether they are the general public or other businesses) you are on a winner. And thirdly, they are creative and future-oriented people who can often see beyond the horizon or think outside the box. If you can put those three things together and be yourself, you will tend to invest yourself in people (giving them time, support and insight) who will then buy from you (as opposed to you selling to them). Because at the end of the day, the Blue business-person is happiest when someone phones  them  up and says "we would like to you do / supply / create x for us".   So why not work at creating the conditions where that will happen, and at least enjoy yourself as you do it!  Elaura - take your people to the top

      Just a note on a handful of scores that are likely to influence how you see "politics" (primarily organisational politics, but this does of course extrapolate to local and national politics as well) and, more importantly, whether you are comfortable engaging in political activity at any level.  Corporate Adaptability (Interview Guide) - a high score here indicates that you, amongst others things, appreciate that "how things get done around here" is how you can actually get things done. You won't be flummoxed if the line between two points A and B takes on some byzantine twists and curls, because you understand that - in this context - that is actually the shortest distance between the two points. People like myself on the other hand, with a very low CA score are under the impression (misapprehension?) that a straight line is the shortest distance between points. So high CA people tend to get things done the way that they can be done, given the chain of command and other political realities; low CA people tend to say "let's just do it!" And then wonder why the wheels come off as they reach the 80%-complete mark.  There is a component score that impacts this area as well. No, not Authority or Structure, which is what you may have been thinking, but rather FREEDOM. A LOW Freedom Usual score suggests that you will be at your most productive fitting in and belonging, which is a precondition for political success. This may come as a surprise - many of the politicians who stick in our minds are the ones who stand out, surely? Think harder - the standing out usually goes with the political wilderness - think Tony Benn for the past quarter century or Churchill in the thirties. Generally speaking, advancement in a "political" context goes with "paying your dues", "pulling your weight" and so on. So LOW Freedom Usual is another indicator that political success is possible.  SO - you have a high CA score, coupled with Low Freedom Usual? Yes, Prime Minister? If you are aspiring for the top job in a large organisation or indeed in the country, there is one more score you should look for: high Public Contact (Interview Guide). Harold Wilson was famously agressive towards anyone who tried doorstopping him (including minor physical assault it seems - not something he could have got away with now) which suggests he may have been a High Detail / Low PC person. For most CEOs and PMs though, a High PC score (indicating a willingness to front up to the public without time to sort or the detail and a readiness to think on your feet) is a necessity - think questions without notice, Naughtie and Humphreys spinning them in from the rough, ITN microphone in your face as they break the news that your product has been linked to cancer.   If this is disappointing - you are a low CA, high Freedom, high Detail kind of person - just remember there are lots of less stressful ways to earn a living!

      Doing a review, several months on from their initial feedback, with two people with Low Usual, High Needs on Advantage this morning, neither of whom seemed very comfortable with the "needs tangible rewards and recognition" part of it. When we went back to the Strength and Needs pages in their reports, one of them had ticked the sentence about needing the support of a competitive environment and put a cross by the rest of the needs paragraph. And that was it - neither of them was conscious of needing reward (or even of needing to keep score) themselves, but they REALLY, REALLY appreciated working with a bunch of healthily competitive people - whose High Usual Styles they complemented with their own Low Usual styles.

      If your team grid (Usual and Needs) is below the mid point, ie Blue / Yellow, you are almost certainly a Low Authority bunch. We work with a number of teams like this.   A wise person we know described a key attribute of Low Usual Authority groups as "The Dead Goat under the Table". In other words, because a Low Authority group won't want to confront issues, there could be a dead goat under the table, and EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM WOULD KNOW there was a dead goat under the table - but noone would want to be the one to mention it. Wouldn't stop them feeling pretty stressed by it. A high Authority person on the other hand is much more likely to say "hey guys, dead goat in here, lets get rid of it so we can all breathe again."   Low Authority Need across a group can also make life interesting; this is a group who prefer leadership by suggestion and who may take offence at anything stronger. They are likely also to face periods of organisational change with some nervousness, fearing the IMPOSITION of change, more than the actual changes.  Put the two together and it can be hard to know how to cope with situations requiring significant change, whether you are part of the group, or the person tasked to lead them through the change. One key strategy is for the Low Authority team to learn active communication. That involves saying "when you said x, I felt y; is that what you meant to communicate". That then opens up constructive dialogue.  "When you mentioned the dead goat, I felt you were blaming me for its presence under the table; is that what you meant to communicate?"  "No, not at all - I was concerned about how you were coping with the smell and just wanted to make things more bearable for you... Was it an issue for you?"  "Well yes, it was. I would love to see it gone, provided..."  Elaura - take your people to the top

      This, unprompted, from a high 90s Outdoor Interest the other day:  "My job is a means of paying for all my outdoor activities."  That is one way - probably the most direct - of reconciling a high Outdoor score with a deskbound job. But getting a view from your desk, getting out at lunch and coffee breaks, and making a point of getting out to see clients rather than vice versa whenever possible can all help to grease the wheels as well.

      In a seminar the other day we had just shown some movie clips and invited the team to guess the characters Birkman Usual and Needs colours, and they had come up with some compelling suggestions. But then one team member - one of two Greens in this largely Blue/Yellow group - made a complaint:   "All the Green characters you chose were negative role models - how about some positive Green examples?"  Fair point. But thinking about it, I started to wonder if in fact Hollywood (or Pinewood) had any to offer. Is there a stereotype at work that means typical Green characteristics (for example, being competitive, persuasive, motivational and high advantage/ high authority) normally equate to "villain", "cad" or at least flawed supporting character. No trouble thinking of Green anti-heros like Gordon Gekko, but Green heroes are a little harder.  By the end of the day we had (from the original questioner) Harold Abrahams from Chariots of Fire as a Green Usual, but even there it is arguable that it is only when his more Blue-looking Needs come to the fore that he becomes a sympathetic character. Not a big haul - so send your suggestions to  urlLink GreenHero@elaura.com    And folks - The Incredible Hulk may be Green in pigmentation terms, but that is Blue Stress behaviour ("ignores social conventions") you are observing...

      When we talk about how you might relate to a group, the first score that comes to mind is your Acceptance Usual and Need. This is a measure of Sociability. Generally speaking, high score people choose (Usual) or need (Needs) to work in groups and on team projects, low score people on their own assignments. Combinations to be aware of are: the person with High Usual, Low Need (if you want to keep them functioning positively in group settings, give them some assignments they can go off and do alone); and the person with a Reversal (Low Usual, Higher Need and Red 25 for Stress) - they seem like they prefer to work on their own, and under stress will withdraw even more, but if you want to keep them positive and productive you need to include them in the group (what someone characterised as "don't ask this person if they are coming to the pub just once - they are bound to say no - ask three times to be sure").  There is another score that can affect your  appearance  of Sociability and that is Social Adaptability (Interview Guide). The underlying measure here is actually of your internal reserves for coping with stress. Huh?   People with high Social Adaptability generally have good internal resources for coping with stressful situations. As a result, they don't have to rely on the stability of their "identity group" (the primary grouping they identify themselves with, maybe coworkers or extended family or a group of close friends) for their own stability.   LOW Social Adaptability people on the other hand are more likely to have as their primary coping mechanism their relationships within their identity group - because their internal stress coping resources are not so great. It is the group that helps them get by.  Now in fact, both High and Low Social Adaptability people may look Sociable most of the time; but where Low SA people will LOOK much less Sociable is if their identity group suffers change - people leaving, new people being included. At that point they may have difficulty responding positively to the newcomers or to the group as a whole, and appear somewhat anti-social or withdrawn. The point is not actually about Sociability, but about how they adapt to  changes  in their primary social grouping - in other words Social ADAPTABILITY.

      You have probably heard the story somewhere of the CEO who started disappearing from the office every Wednesday afternoon, with no explanation given. His secretary and close colleagues began to assume that he was having an affair, but were worried because this seemed so out of character. The story ends with the revelation that the CEO had in fact rented a small workshop unit near his office and set up a woodturning lathe there. Every Wednesday afternoon he went to his workshop and turned out beautiful bowls and chair legs. Why did he do it? He had discovered that this un-CEO like activity kept his batteries charged for the rest of the working week.  Many of us operate at far less than our full potential paradoxically because we are too focussed on the main task. We lack the wisdom and self-understanding of the CEO in the story who knew that something other than his main job was the most powerful way of keeping himself motivated. The key to accessing this insght for yourself is found in the Areas of Interest section of your report. (I'm sure that CEO had a high Mechanical score)  Any score over 90, and at least your top two scores are interests that are particularly effective in keeping you motivated. For example, my top two scores are Musical and Outdoor; recognising the power of these scores has meant I have been able to make myself much more effective. Instead of pushing myself harder when I start to flag, I am now more likely to go out for a walk or take a few minutes to play some music; the net result is far more (and better) work than if I ploughed on regardless.  We don't all have that kind of freedom in our workplace (although the question WHY not? presents itself... smart management works on results, not the number of hours chained to the galley's oars) but we can all give ourselves permission to make time for things that can refresh us. If you ever find yourself thinking "I wish I could... but that would be selfish / show a lack of commitment to the job / the family / whatever", just stop and think whether this is an expression of those high Interest scores and whether the effect of charging your batteries up might bring more benefits to everyone involved than simply boxing on.

      Many of our jobs involve systems and we either love them or resent them.... or do we?  You may be one of those who really enjoys designing systems but when it comes to following, using and maintaining them you inwardly groan!  Surprising?  Not really, lets look at the scores which will influence this. If you have yellow interests you may well like systems - putting them in place  and  following them - how can life work without them?. If you have blue interests you may well like to design and create systems  but  when it comes to running them you probably have something new and much more interesting to think about!  Take a look at your  structure  score too. High usual score and you will be systematic and ordered in your approach and if your need is high too you will  want  those systems and procedures to follow, they will really help.  However, if your need is low, you may be the most systematic person there is but you will not want  other people's  systems imposed on you!   For those with the low usual/high need it'll be the other way. You'll operate in a seeming muddle to the high score people but it works for you and what will help you is having system and procedure  in the background  . If that's not there watch out for real chaos!    Elaura - take your people to the top

      Does your behaviour sometimes take you completely by surprise? Where did that come from you wonder.  Take a person with a reversal on their authority score, for example. Their usual style may be pleasant, easygoing, ageeable; they avoid open clashes and are generally eager to please. Their  need  is to experience the same from others and it is when they don't that the switch can occur!   Someone begins getting antagonistic towards them, laying down the law, becoming confrontational with them, perhaps assuming that pleasant, easygoing person will simply cave in and back down. How wrong they are!  What is more likely is that they will receive a mouthful back, an aggressive argument, a domineering response and this will surprise them and probably the other person too!  As with all reversals, if that need isn't met,  the stress behaviour  will be extremely opposite to the person's need and  will definitely work against getting that need met.  They  need  low-key, they have  created  fierce-key!  The solution? Try to spot that reversal stress behaviour as it wells up and determine to keep calm, excuse yourself to come back and tackle the situation later when things aren't so charged. When you've done that a few times you'll begin to spot the pattern and catch yourself before the fireworks begin!  Elaura - take your people to the top

      I am normally up and running at the crack of dawn, but the last week I have been struggling to sit up and drink my tea, let alone race into action. And I have been pretty clunky all day. This morning I was lying there wondering why I was so inert, and suddenly realised that although my body wasn't moving, my mind had been ranging far and wide... and it struck me that this might be my very high Thought Need (and very low Activity Need - both of which mean time for reflection is crucial) demanding to be met.   Further reflection (you see!) then brought to mind the fact that after an intensive and thought provoking business seminar early last week, I had then launched into a camping trip with the family which had - unusually - provided little or no "thinking" time. Back at work this week and trying to be my Usual low Thought/ high Activity self with a head full of underprocessed data did not work. So don't call me tomorrow, I'm away over the hills on Dartmoor to do some "processing"...  There is a moral of this little tale, namely that any time you are finding it hard to be what you consider to be your "normal" self, reflect on what you are "being" instead - and then try matching that manifested Need with what your Birkman Report says (try your Coaching Page or Needs at a Glance Page if you are less confident about the raw scores).

      Your Challenge score is arguably the most important in your profile; Challenge tends to overlay every other score. Fundamentally it is an indication of how you construct your view of yourself. Low Challenge people tend to look internally, be pretty happy with what they find there and therefore come across as confident and comfortable inside their own skins. High Challenge people on the other hand construct their view of themselves by looking outside themselves, at what they have accomplished.  So what happens when things go wrong and you have made a mistake? Well, if you are high Challenge you aren't particularly taken aback, you may well be self-critical, but there will be a tendency to say "...so I better try again right now and do better this time..."  Low Challenge people take it a little differently. Bringing home failure to a Low Challenge person can be quite devastating for them - and take you some time. (I remember a colleague whose response to every approach along the lines of "we have a bit of a problem here" was "yes, you do have a problem"...)  If you are Low Challenge your first and second line of defence is likely to be "not my fault". If it begins to dawn on you that it is your fault, then you may try to justify why you couldn't have been expected to cope with that situation. If serious failure gets through to you, it may leave you feeling quite shattered - because funnily enough it is the Low Challenge, internally oriented person who finds failure hard. The externally oriented High Challenge person accepts failure as part of the territory. In fact, if you are a 97 Challenge or higher, you may even expect to fail constantly... which can present some problems of its own.  Curious thing I have observed about some 1 or 2 (ie very low) Challenge people is that they may actually take all the responsibility when things go wrong. Their view of themselves viz most other people is so strongly positive that they feel they should take responsibility for everything that goes wrong - unlike the slightly higher Low Challenge person who is clear it wasn't their fault.  If this is making you think that Challenge is not as straightforward as the other Birkman components - you are absolutely correct!  btw, the Guide Pages report (which is more or less  the  original Birkman Report) is an excellent example of how Challenge overlays other scores, as well as how the other scores interact with one another. Not for the faint of heart, though - you tend to see your stress behaviours in glorious living Technicolor&reg; in this report!  Elaura - take your people to the top

      My better half spotted this one - the other morning I walked out the front door and found three drill attachments (a wire brush and two sanding pads) lying on the footpath outside. They were all covered in a film of rust, as if they had been lying in water. My immediate response was to spin around and look up, saying as I did, "oh no, have we lost a gutter in the night?"  Sarah pointed out that a normal (by which she meant less extreme Global) response to this situation would be to say, "someone dropped some rubbish outside my house during the night", and that it took a very high Global score to spot the rusty watermarks and then want to find a comprehensive big picture which explained the immediately observable phenomenon - in this case "the guy we bought the house from was a bit of a cowboy, I wouldn't put it past him to have left some tools in the guttering when he was mending the roof, now the guttering has fallen and here are the rusty tools on the footpath."   Of course, as soon as I saw the gutters were all still in place, this theory went out the window - but too late, she had already caught me out. That's okay - my next post will be how a low Challenge person responds when they realise that they alone were responsible for letting a virus loose on the network...(ow! stop! I was joking...)

      A very experienced Birkman consultant once explained "low Empathy Need" to a class I was in by telling us about the time she was asked to give a speech about Dr Birkman at the Birkman International 40th anniversary dinner. No sooner had she started speaking than she became choked up, starting crying uncontrollably and had to leave the stage. On her return, Dr Birkman came over to her and said, "you low Empathy Need people are so sentimental..."  She was a bit surprised by this - low Empathy scores are normally presented as being about objectivity over subjectivity - but she asked a few questions and came to realise that Empathy Need is fundamentally an indication of emotional capacity. High scores are those who not only need lots of outlets for their subjective feelings and will be very aware of the emotional climate around them, but also can cope with having a lot of raw emotion in the environment... and still keep functioning. Low Needs on the other hand reach emotional overload much sooner; and emotional overload for many people converts to tears. So, she told us, low Empathy Need people are often the first to weep in a weepy movie - they just can't handle the emotional overload.  The corollary to this of course is that very high Empathy Need people may well cry in movies as well. What's the difference? The Low Empathy Need folks hate the fact that they have started weeping; us High Empathy Needs people actually rather enjoy it!  Elaura - take your people to the top

      Hayley Hanson (see previous four blogs) has just finished her second year as a Psychology student at University of Plymouth. She spent the last week working with Elaura with a view to working part time with us through her final year from September. Writing a daily blog was one of her assignments, intended as a means of reinforcing her learning. We were deeply impressed by both the speed with which she picked up the detail of the Birkman and especially the connections she was able to make between different parts of the instrument - something that normally takes some time. We look forward to working with Hayley as an assistant over the next 12 months. With a Social Service Interest score of 99, helping others understand themselves better is a pretty strong motivator for her!  If you are calling the office from September you may well get to speak to Liz Barnes as well, who has been keeping the books for us since 2003 but is joining us now as our office administrator. Liz's Blue Usual style fits in well with the rest of us, but her 99 scores on both Numerical and Clerical signal someone who is much more likely to keep the systems and numbers in shape than I am!

      Isn't it amazing how you never realise how much effort goes into the finished product. I never spare a thought for how much effort went into baking and icing a birthday cake, i simply take a huge big bite and enjoy!! When i was given the feedback on my Birkman profile, i never realised how much work had gone into preparing it and the time my consultant had spent trying to gain a better understanding of my profile. Well today i've been having a go myself and i've begun to realise how complex we as people are. There's just so many possibilities and so many things that seem to interplay.   The more i study profiles the more i start to see the links between components, such as structure, activity, etc and how these components can also be linked with peoples interests and usual behaviours. As much as i'm starting to realise that there's definite relationships that may occur. I'm also trying to learn that certain scores are not predictive of others. For example i may expect that as my usual behaviour is in the blue quadrant; which tends to suggest i'm  quite creative and thoughtful, that i would be highly interested in an Artistic area, however I actually score quite low in this area. This does not mean that my profile is wrong, it simply shows that my creative behaviour can be seen in other interests, for example, i have higher scores on musical and literary interests. This just reminded me of how natural it is for us to try to predict other people's behaviour, we do it all the time! However i must remember that everyone is individual and will react to things in their own unique way.   Elaura - take your people to the top

      Today i've been looking through my stress pages. Yes, it sounds bad but there's actually more than one page! I've found them very useful in not only highlighting the areas in which i can get stressed and what my needs are. Oh no, these pages go one step further and give suggestions on how to manage my stress behaviour and find ways to meet my needs. There are specific suggestions which can be applied to your daily life.   For example, I have high stress and needs scores for Esteem and Acceptance, which results in a stress behaviour in the area of Interpersonal relationships. I tend to need acceptance, approval, genuine respect and recognition from others. When these needs aren't met, for example, if somebody is quite blunt with me and i don't feel accepted or appreciated, I will tend to get my feelings hurt quite easily. The stress pages suggested things like spending more time with that special person who makes you feel good about yourself. It made me realise that although it seems like common sense to do these things, i'm most likely to acknowledge how i'm feeling and not do anything about it! However when you have suggestions sitting straight in front of you, it seems obvious that you are much more likely to take action to resolve the problem.  I just wanted to highlight the usefulness of these pages as i think that at first sight you may only see one or two things which you could implement. However given more attention and as usually happens when you re-read information, you'll tend to absorb more of it and find yourself able to apply suggestions to further areas of your life. Hopefully resulting in smoother runnings! It's great to be aware of our behaviour but isn't it even better when we find ways of managing unproductive behaviour?

      Wow! I've just realised how important it is to let people know what you really need from them! I have been using my summary one sheet to try and develop my action plan. (A tool i think most people would find very useful! I know it takes time but it's not that long and as they always say , the more you put into it, the more you'll reap in return.)   Anyway, i was examining two of my components, where i have quite low scores for my usual behaviour and fairly high scores for my needs (there's got to be a difference of 40 between the two scores); basically meaning i can be a wee bit unpredictable at times and people are likely to misread the signs i send out. This can cause problems sometimes and i'm sure is the root of much confusion in many relationships.   I really believe that simply making sure we are aware of these areas and alerting those close to us of what our real needs are is a huge step in eliminating much of our own stress which occurs when those hidden needs aren't met. The Action Planner designates an area for us to highlight the specific components where we are likely to be misread. If you think other people never give you what you need this is definitely for you! When you realise what you really need don't keep it to yourself, tell others so they can try to understand you too.   Elaura - take your people to the top

      Whilst trying to gain a better understanding of my scores today, I was reading through the coaching guide. I kept trying to make sure I had clear defintions of the areas of interest to see how I could relate them back to myself. Suddenly it clicked, certain areas of interest seemed to be related for me.  Reading the definition of Literary, i realised that my relatively high interest in this area may be a factor that also influences my interest in persuasiveness. I am able to use writing and language skills that i have previously learnt to help me feel more confident in public speaking, therefore often more effective at formal persuasion and debating. I made a link between these two areas whilst reading their definitions and when i went back to look at my scores to check, sure enough there was only a difference of 1!   I am glad that i have had the opportunity to develop these literary skills and am now more aware of how useful they are in aiding my persuasiveness and increasing my interest in this area also. Are there any areas of interest in your report where you can see a link. Maybe your interest in one area can be related to another area that you find motivating. I feel this may give you better understanding of how your interests can interplay. Resulting in a fuller picture for yourself.  Elaura - take your people to the top

      I was talking to a partner at a professional services firm last friday who said "yes, I saw one of your Birkman Reports last week." He then mentioned the name of the client, who was indeed a client of ours also.  I was pleased, for at least two reasons. One was that Elaura has covered enough ground that a client we have met through one channel can talk about us to a prospective client we then meet through a completely unrelated channel(if you market professional services you may understand the significance!) - and that in a city a long way from Plymouth .   But the more fundamental reason for celebration was that our client was using his Birkman Report to explain himself, his needs and motivations to a professional who was going to have to advise him on major decisions. In effect he was saying - "this  is me! "  Sparked another thought of course - we are currently redesigning our web presence, and have realised that we should be giving prominence to our professional clients who are "Birkman aware" - ie if you have found your Birkman insightful and need legal / accounting / financial or whatever advice, consider using a firm whose staff have been through the Birkman themselves and will understand what yours says about you.

      As you may have noticed, we tend to be somewhat erratic in the posting of new blogs - not that we can't think of things to say, just that there aren't always enough hours in the day in which to say them. The good news is that Birkman like the idea of the blog and have asked if we can open it up to other Birkman-certified consultants and corporate end-users. This creates the possibility of a growing dialogue, rather than the monologue it has been so far. Blog content will be available not only to other consultants but to their clients as well - a win-win-win scenario.  Speaking of change - I'm one of those lucky people with a change reversal, ie who look responsive, need a surprising degree of stability and focus and when even small surprises are sprung on them, start second guessing and changing everything in sight (which of course only makes things worse). However this kind of change - throwing open our Blog to the rest of the world - doesn't count because I was involved in the process. So if you have a change reversal or have to live or deal with someone who has one, that's the secret - if you can see that something previously agreed needs to change, keep them in the loop before anything is decided and let them help drive the process. They'll be wonderfully responsive, rather than disruptively reactive!   Elaura - take your people to the top

      I am still amazed how readily people often recognise themselves in their Birkman scores and will describe themselves to you in that, "Yes, that's exactly it" kind of way!   My latest example is a lady with a challenge score of 6 and authority and advantage need scores of 81 and 96 ( high authority and advantage need are the&nbsp;"need to win" combination!).  &nbsp; Her literary score was 97. She talked about her love for reading and how she had written some childrens books but never sent them off to a publisher. When I probed further she explained that although people had encouraged her to do so,&nbsp;she was too worried that they would be rejected. "I would never write again if that happened". (That's the&nbsp;low challenge "fear of failure"!)  &nbsp; However, when a school motto competition was announced at her children's school she couldn't wait to submit her entry. Why the difference?  &nbsp; "I knew it would come in the top three," she said, "and as it happened it won. I need to be sure I'll win!"  &nbsp; Isn't that exactly it with that low challenge and that high authority and advantage needs scores?

      Here's an illustration of how a high structure score can express itself as "selectively" structured! &nbsp; My client had an 85 on Structure Usual. He had just moved to a new job and described how he tended to delay the administrative tasks that landed on his desk - on other words, despite his High Structure Usual,&nbsp;he struggled to be systematic about those.  &nbsp; However, as we talked further he revealed that at home he had large collections of CDs, maps, geographical and mountain climbing books which he carefully ordered alphabetically and could find at a moments notice should the need arise. In this area he was incredibly structured! We looked at his interest scores; his bottom two were clerical and numerical; his top three were literary, musical and outdoor. It mattered to him that he was structured about these topics but being structured about his work responsibilities wasn't half so appealing!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Elaura - take your people to the top

      This post is for all the new contributing members of the blog.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am assuming you have already accepted your invitation to join - if not, do it now!   Day 1. Get Blogger to remember who you are (don't do this from a shared PC)!Go to  urlLink www.blogger.com . At top right you will see "Already have an account? Sign in:"Simply enter your username and password in the boxes, and then check the "Remember me" checkbox. Now click the "sign in" button. Next time you go to  urlLink www.blogger.com  (from this computer) it will sign you in automatically. &nbsp;  Day 2. Get the rest of us to remember who you are. Go to  urlLink www.blogger.com  and - assuming you completed Day 1. above - it will take you straight to the blogger "dashboard". Over on the right you will see "Edit your profile". Click that link and you will be taken to a page where you can enter as much or as little personal data as you like. But it means if someone likes one of your posts, they can find out more about you. &nbsp;  Day 3. Go on - blog a little. Get to the blogger dashboard as per the above, but this time click on the green "+" sign to the right of "Elaura's Birkman Method Blog". This will load the form that allows you to make a new post to the blog. Give it a "title", leave "link" blank - unless you are writing about something which refers to a specific page on the web - and then type your post in the big box below. You can delete the "Elaura - take your people to the top" bit, that is just how we have been signing off our posts when the blog was just us.But what to write? Okay, here's your exercise: tell us how long you have been using the Birkman Method and what you find most helpful about it for your clients (internal clients if you are a corporate user). You can even give us the link to your home page or other relevant web page in the "link" box. If you want to get sophisticated, experiment with the text formatting and other buttons above the big "content" box. &nbsp;  Day 4. Have your say - you can add comments to other people's posts. Instead of having to go into blogger, you can just go straight to the blog itself -  urlLink www.elaura.com/blog/blogger.asp . After each existing post you will see the time of posting and then "0 comments" or however many comments there are. Clicking that link will take you to a page showing existing comments plus a "Post a Comment" link - click and then enter your comment. (I would prefer you to post using your username, ie not anonymously).  Day 5. Go on - blog a lot. When you are with clients and they give you a vivid illustration of how a particular score works for them, make a note to blog it (with identifying details removed, of course.). When you get to your PC, go to  urlLink www.blogger.com  and... blog away!  Elaura - take your people to the top

      If you have reversals in your profile (red 75 or 25 in the stress column) you will know that these are the areas where your stress behaviour actually makes things worse for you, because your behaviour is the opposite of what you need. But what happens when reversals hunt in packs?   I had to think about this a couple of weeks ago when I saw two (completely unrelated) clients on the same day, each of whom had five reversals, including a triad of Change / Freedom / Thought.   So think about this - your underlying needs are: the opportunity to focus with no surprises (low Change), to be in the organisational loop and feel you belong (low Freedom) and to get quickly to closure and not be left in the air with decisions (low Thought).   Some stressors may indeed only trigger one of these reversals - for example, a decision which you are perfectly in the loop on and have seen coming is nonetheless on hold indefinitely, thereby failing to meet just your thought need for closure and triggering your "rabbit caught in the headlights" indecisive stress behaviour (think "moose in the headlights" if that is more relevant in your location!)   But what about an email that comes in mid morning saying simply "as some of you will know [but not you - you're out of the loop] we are planning a major reorganisation of the department [unforeseen changes]. This email is just to let you know that the timeframe for this has been put back 6 months [it will be at least that long before we get any closure]&nbsp;because of... [and by now it doesn't matter what the reason is, you are already somewhere out past the spiral arm of the galaxy, powered by the thermonuclear power of your triple reversal].   I am sure you can come up with other combinations of reversals that might have this kind of mutually reinforcing effect; the broader&nbsp;point is that some needs can be violated and stress triggered by the same event, and what looks like 2 or 3 discrete behavioural components may present at times as a single hot-spot!

      Recently, I asked a lifelong friend of mine to take The Birkman.  We have known each other since we were six years old.  We have always been great friends but there were aspects about her personality that drove me crazy and vice versa.  I just knew that when I got her Birkman report back, I was going to find that we were polar opposites!     To my complete shock I discovered that we only had 1 difference in terms of our component scores...our Authority.  I am 6/6 and she is 72/91.  Immediately, it all made sense!  She was always annoyed with me because I wouldn't just speak my mind and I with her because she was so bossy.     The Differences to Watch report summed it up perfectly,  she is " self-assertive, stimulated by debate, covets influence over others; an aggressive thinker ".  I, on the other hand, " hold to my own opinion, am self-directive, prefer pleasant, agreeable relationships and am anxious to please ."  Under stress she is likely to see me as " evasive, reluctant to speak up, and passively resistant ."  Under stress, I am likely to see her as, " overly aggressive, argumentative, and debating just to challenge ."   If only I had asked her to take The Birkman before my wedding!  She felt like she was doing me a favor when she told me that she didn't like the bridesmaids dress I had chosen.  After all, she felt she owed it to me to tell me what she was thinking.  I on the other hand felt sick to my stomach.  How could someone actually tell their friend that?  I like  pleasant, agreeable , relationships!  Doesn't everyone?  The truth is that in terms of our authority score, rarely does my usual behavior meet her need and vice versa.   Now that I am aware of our scores, it has helped tremendously.  I don't feel bad anymore when I decline an offer to go out, or have dinner together.  I know she would do the same, and now that I know how high her need is; 91, I know that she expects and needs me to be up front about my thinking.   It's amazing to see how even one component can affect so many aspects of our friendship.  But if we hadn't had The Birkman, I think we just might have driven eachother crazy for the rest of our lives, and we might never have even known why!

       People have always described me as quiet and relatively shy, the consummate Introvert.&nbsp; The funny part is that I love groups, teams, and being around other people.&nbsp; It wasn't until I had taken The Birkman Method that I understood more about myself.&nbsp; I realized that with my high Esteem score (57) and my high Acceptance score (84), I participated in groups but often the quiet one of the group.  This was a major "a-ha'" moment for me at the time because it explained so much.&nbsp; Since then I have used Birkman for the past 8 years and have seen hundreds of reports with every pattern imaginable.&nbsp; I often look at my scores and receive new insight but recently I had an encounter with a consultant that made me understand much more about myself.&nbsp; I could never get over my initial discomfort with groups.&nbsp; I started facilitating Birkman training sessions several years ago and I learned quickly that it was difficult working&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;a large group of people.&nbsp; The strange thing was, I have no problem when in front of other office team members.&nbsp; The consultant put it in perspective for me.&nbsp;   With the combination of the higher Esteem and higher Acceptance, I am drawn towards groups and other people.&nbsp; The Esteem score is important because it suggests that I work best when I have one-on-one interactions.&nbsp; It then clicked!&nbsp; The groups I do best in, and feel the most comfortable in front of, are the ones where I have had an opportunity to get to know the members on a personal level before working in the group setting.&nbsp; That was the reason that facilitation of a training session was so difficult, there was no opportunity to relate to the participants and get to know them ahead of time.  So, the next time you register for a Birkman training course that I happen to facilitate, expect my call!

      An outpouring, or "blogging" of my thoughts on sustainable success.  For a long time I assumed that the environment around me&nbsp;played an integral&nbsp;part in&nbsp;the success or non-success&nbsp;potential of my life. I&nbsp;knew from the&nbsp;beginning that my ability to achieve success and the ability to sustain it comfortably over time&nbsp;might not&nbsp;rest&nbsp;solely upon my own personal initiative, skills and experience.&nbsp;Those would be important but not the only ones.&nbsp;So what are the other factors.  The organizations that I've been a part of have stressed experience and skills as the path to success. Thus, time, energy&nbsp;and money were invested into&nbsp;equipping me with the experience (direct or vicarious) and skills to bring about higher potential for success. I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;fortunate to have succeeded (according to my organization's measurement criteria for success) in each role that I have been in, but the success (for myself) was not sustainable. My experience and skills increased but something was still missing for me. Something more personal.  In&nbsp;June 2001 I experienced The Birkman Method for myself.&nbsp;After&nbsp;receiving my interpretive feedback my vision of how&nbsp;to obtain sustainable success expanded. More specifically, it was when I learned about Needs. Birkman describes Needs as, " how the person wants or needs others to act toward them and what types of behaviors the person wants to be required to express for extended periods of time ".&nbsp;This was my&nbsp;"aha" moment.   I learned that being myself and living that every day will be&nbsp;the most&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;component of achieving sustainable success for me. That, in fact, if the environment around me does not allow for me to meet my Needs (be myself), I will not obtain sustainable success. I can comfortably and honestly make a more&nbsp;informed decision about if an environment is right or wrong for me.   In&nbsp;most respects, I am a "what you see is what you get" individual. My Usual behavior scores often mirror closely my Needs scores. For example, I have a 5 Esteem Usual and 13 Esteem Need. The remainder of my Usual/Need scores do the same.&nbsp;It has increased my&nbsp;self-awareness along with my awareness that most people are  not  like me (most people are not "what you see is what you get"; for example they may have a 5 Esteem Usual, but their Esteem Need is 75). This information&nbsp;has been helpful for me in navigating the environments that I participate in. Keeps me tuning in to others potential needs when I don't have The Birkman Method in hand.

      A recent career transition client with a 44-9-75 Esteem score, (representing a departure from norm as you can see) shared a  story illustrating the dynamics of this component during the termination meeting with his boss.  Having anticipated the subject and purpose of the meeting, he grabbed the reins early in the session saying, " I know you are going to notify me today that I no longer have a job and I want you to know I am ok with it." I was very impressed with his finding a way to combine sensitivity to his boss' probable dread of passing on unpleasant news while taking care of his own need for minimum sentiment and directness on the issue.
