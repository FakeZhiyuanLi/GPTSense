         Well, it seems that I can't access my web page from any computer in Shanghai...I must be a threat to the communist way of life.   &nbsp;   Today was a looong day...lots and lots of walking.&nbsp; Shanghai is a huge city and much much more modern than I thought.&nbsp; While walking down Huaihai Ave. felt like I was back in Tokyo on Omotesando or Ginza.&nbsp; Mr. Donut, Big Echo, MacDonalds, and KFC were everywhere.&nbsp; Lots of stylish botiques, cafes, and other shops dot the avenue with huge buildings every where you look.&nbsp; I had a hard time even finding some local eats in this area (but I did...and it was gooood).   &nbsp;   I spend the morning walkiing from my hostel to The People's Square.&nbsp; On the way I passed a small market that was cool.&nbsp; I sat down in a little restaraunt for some "breakfast"...I find it really cool that I can actually kind of sort of look at menus and get an idea of what might show up on my plate...my kanji skills are coming in useful...   &nbsp;   After I got to the peoples square, I went to check out the Shanghai Museum.&nbsp; This is a really impressive museum, and absolutely gigantic.&nbsp; You could easily spend over 4hrs in there if you wanted to look at each exhibit and read all the explanations (all written in very good English, I might add.&nbsp; Japan, take a lesson!).&nbsp; I got a bit tired after 2hrs and kind of breezed through the exhibits.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   As I left the exhibit, I got approached by a young girl and an even younger boy who wanted to chat and practice English.&nbsp; They were really nice and I enjoyed talking with them in teh Peoples Square.&nbsp; Our conversation seemed to attract attention as people would sort of stop and watch us talk for a few minutes, and then move on...we did attract one interesting fellow.&nbsp; This old man spoke very good english, although he had a sort of speaking impairment.&nbsp; The man claims he was just let out of a Chinese Prision 5 months ago; where he has been for the last 15 years.&nbsp; He used to be a teacher at an International Language School in Beijing.&nbsp; Apparently, he helped organize and motivate some students during the student revolutino in Tienanmen Square.&nbsp; The man spoke in a very confident and intelligent manner...his eyes looked like he has seen some hard times and his stench and clothes suggest that he hasnt been allowed to reenter society, so to speak.&nbsp; He told me he is writing a book...he wants the world to know what goes on in Chinese prisons.&nbsp; I am not sure what to believe from this whole story.&nbsp; In the end, he did ask me for money, but he said it was so he could buy an English magazine to translate; he can get paid for that kind of work.&nbsp; I gave him my leftover yen, which he gladly accepted saying he has a friend in Hong Kong who could exchange it.&nbsp; He gave me his address and we parted ways.&nbsp; He was interesting to talk with, but after a while I felt like he was invading my space, and I was eager to leave him.&nbsp; Maybe I will write him a letter and see if he finished his book...you never know!   &nbsp;   -------------------------   &nbsp;   After thinking what to do next, I decided that I must follow my heart and journey to Shaolin-shi.&nbsp; I am going to study kung-fu for a day.&nbsp; I hope to at least master one technique like Buddha Palm or Dragon Leaping over the Mountain...if they refuse to teach me I will challenge the head monk to a fight; he will not be able to refuse.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   I am guessing it might be near a week before I can see a computer again...so hold tight.   &nbsp;   dan

       Made it into Shanghai last night after a short flight from Tokyo.    I do not reccomend anyone to fly China Eastern Airlines.  I am not even sure what kind of planes they use.  I usually like to try and grab the emergency exit row seats when I am forced to fly with the peasants in economy class, but this exit row actually had me frightened.  I will not even talk about how you are supposed to "Arm" or "Disarm" the door, like it is a piece of artilary, but rather focus on the dangers of actually opening it in the event of an emergency.  There is a big red warning that says "Residual Cabin Pressue will cause violent door opening!"  I had images of the plane crashing and me being responsible for opening the door, only to be violently ejected due to residual cabin pressue.  This is of course if I could even figure out how to open it, as it was the most complicated door I have ever seen....Anyway, I made it alright..but never again will I fly China Eastern.  On to Shanghai.  Ever since I arrived the city has been shrouded in a dense cloud/fog.  It makes for a real surreal skyline at night.  My impression of the city is that it has one foot in the future, and one in the past, stradling the Huangpo River.  There are modern sky scrapers, and old architecture that reminds me of the 1930s (just what I imagine at least).  The streets are bustling with people, bikes, cars, and taxis with very useful interactive TV sets.  The food is cheap and delicious...I ate a feast last night for about $2.50 including beer!  Anecdote of the Day:  Getting my head shaved...  I decided to chop off my balding mane of hair and go for the Shaolin look.  While strolling through one of the many alleyways in old shanghai, I found a salon with a little style and tried my luck.  Before I knew it I had a cheering section of about 5 people...it took only a few minutes to communicate how I wanted my hear, and 30min and $1 dollar later I have more of a Bruce Willis look than Jet Li, but mission accomplished!  enough for now... dan  p.s.  I wish I could post some pictures, but this cafe does not have the technology...I will as soon as I have the opportunity

        urlLink    Ishikawa, Japan&nbsp; urlLink     More than 3 years have gone by and my time in Japan is finally coming to an end.  Japan will always have a special place in my heart.  The friends I made here, the people I loved, places I've seen, the sounds, smells, and tastes, and the fluffy white powdery snow have all made an impact on me; enough to last me a lifetime.  Although I am sad to leave, I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my life.  In September I will be in Seattle at the University of Washington trying to get a PhD. in Aero-Astro Engineering.  Before that I am going to do a little travel.  1 month in China followed by a week in Thailand, 1 week in Bali, and then 2 weeks in Australia to visit my Sister.  Should be a good trip!!

       I recently had the pleasure and honor to see the Derek Trucks Band play live TWICE here in Tokyo.  His second performance was part of the annual Hibiya Blues Carnival.  There is something to be said about this young master, especially when a blues legend like Otis Rush stops what he is doing to watch the phenom at work.    Derek Trucks is on the cutting edge of the Jam Band music scene sliding along gracefuly.  Danz   urlLink    I am not worthy  &nbsp; urlLink

       Thailand has been an interesting trip so far.  My first 2 nights were spent in Bangkok living the rock-star lifestyle.  I stayed at Dans friends house who is a DJ/Producer in Bangkok.  He lives in this incredible 5 story house that is very European looking with white walls and huge windows.  I watched him spin at this one club called Mystique my first night.  It was filled with many many beautiful women and was quite stylish...especially after coming from china.  I was going through a little bit of culture shock.  The next day was spent recovering and just cruising around the city.  Nothing special...my time in Thailand is short and I wanted to get down south to my friends place as soon as possible.  I ended up taking a flight, as it was only $15 more than the 13hr train ride...  -------  My friends family live in the small town of Nong-Chik, which is about 8 km from Pattani.  The southern 4 provinces have been plagued recently with war and unrest.  Near the border of Malaysia, there is a very large Muslim population there (some areas are more than 90% Muslim).  Only 2 months ago in Pattani over 100 people were killed in a massive firefight between the Police and activists.  Needless to say this environment does not produce a very safe-feeling atmosphere.  My host family kept me on a very short leash and would not let me go anywhere alone.  They told me stories of how just last month you could go jogging in the morning, but now it was too dangerous.  Everything was too dangerous; drive by shootings, riots, you name it!  It sounds more like compton than Thailand to me.  Despite the situation there, it was a very nice time.  My host family was very hospitable.  They live in a very simple house on stilts, with an annex on the ground.  The "shower" is really just a deep well where you pull up buckets of water to wash with.  There are small chicks running around and of course, palm trees everywhere.  The family unit seems very important, as all the neighbours seemed to be related some how.    I would have liked to explore the town on my own, but ended up been driven around everywhere.  They took me to some Wat, town center, and a very very empty beach about 30 minutes away.  Of course, they fed me constantly as well.  Under different circumstances I would have loved to stay longer.  They were such gracious hosts, but I felt a bit stiffled and imposing by having to be driven around everywhere.  Maybe when things settle down here I will visit again.  ------  Timing so had it that I am in Thailand during a full moon.  That means Full Moon Parties!!!  So I am now at the source, Ko Pha-Ngam (well, I will go there tomorrow).  Time to paaar-tiiii

         Amazingly, the first month of my trip is over and I leave China tomorrow.&nbsp; Time really flew here and I wish I could spend at least another 3 months in China.&nbsp; This country is just too big for 1 month...there is so much more I wanted to see, taste, and experience here.&nbsp; Next time...   &nbsp;   Tomorrow I head to Bangkok for a week in paradise.&nbsp; My new friend Dan happens to be going there as well.&nbsp; Bangkok is almost like a second home to him so he his putting me up at his place and we are going to hit the town hard tomorrow.&nbsp; From there I head waaaay down south to visit a small village of a friend I made when I was in Cambodia a few months ago.&nbsp; It is near Malaysia and is a mix of Malay, Thai, Muslim, and Buddhist culture.&nbsp; Sounds like a good time!&nbsp; Hopefully I can get some pics up then....   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         I just spent 2 days at Longji, Dragon Backbone Terraces.&nbsp; What an incredible place.&nbsp; I have never seen Human intervention in such a beautiful natural landscape of this scale before.&nbsp; There is something incredibly beautiful about all those ordered parallel curves&nbsp;hugging the contours of the mountain.&nbsp; It looks like a topographical map!&nbsp;  The town itself is just a few clusters of large wooden houses.&nbsp; The minority group there where colorful skirts and put their hair up in a neat little pattern ontop of their heads.&nbsp; The weather is very very warm and sticky, and all that sitting water means lots of mosquitoes and bugs...   &nbsp;   I went with excellent company...2 auzie blokes and an american artist...it really was a great group and we had lots of fun (and beers...) together.&nbsp; It really was a great 2 days spent, such a nice change from the touristy mess in yangshuo...   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         Yangshuo is considered the ultimate backpackers/travellers paradise in China...and I can see why.&nbsp; The scenery is spectacular, the town is very nice, and the ammeneties are plentifull...lots of shops, lots of hostels, and lots of places to eat and drink (including plenty of western food).&nbsp; I am going to chill here for a few days before making my way back to Guangzhou and on to Thailand.&nbsp; Because of the popularity, prices here are a bit steeper than the ultimate rural areas, and I already feel like I am spending more here...but its nice, and it still isnt really that expensive...   &nbsp;   I got in late last night, and it turned into a long one as I made friends with 3 ozzies.&nbsp; I gotta hand it to the ozzies, they are the best people in the world to just bump into and get wasted with.&nbsp; Good fellas, all of them.&nbsp; Anyway, we drank late into the night, played a chinese dice drinking game with some locals...that was cool..a great game!   &nbsp;   The driniking made it a bit rought to get an early start, so I didnt make my way out of bed until near noon.&nbsp; After a big breakfast I rented a bike and with a local and very friendly guide, cycled around the outskirts of the town.&nbsp; This place is soooo beautiful, just like what I imagined China would be like from all those scroll paintings and stuff.&nbsp; Did a small little tour of Buddha-Water Cave...saw some stalagtites and got a break from the nasty heat and humidity outside.   &nbsp;   Plenty to do here...and good interenet too, so I will keep things current.&nbsp; With pictures!!   &nbsp;   mata ne...   &nbsp;   dan

         Anyone who went to MIT with me knows of the one and only Pu Pu Hot Pot.&nbsp; For 5 years a standard part of my diet was supplied by Pu Pu.&nbsp; I never really knew what this whole Hot Pot thing was, just thought it was some silly chinese name...but I have finally come to the Hot Pot mecca and truly understand...why I never tried it there, I dont know (and maybe its a good idea to stay away!).   &nbsp;   Hot Pot is one of the famous Sizuan cuisines...it is basdically a hot pot (duh...) of boiling-super-spicey-make-you-sweat-just-looking-at-it oil and you throw in various stuff into it from noodles to intestines and eat.&nbsp; Kato-san and I went to this famous all0-you-can-eat place.&nbsp; 29 yuan for all you can eat and drink (soft-drinks).&nbsp; If you want beer, you can get a 1.5 liter pitcher for 8 yuan (that is less than 1buck!).&nbsp; This place is massive!!&nbsp; And it totally seems very un-communist to me...it makes good old american buffets look like snacks.&nbsp; It is pure excess...if I just think of the amount of food I didnt finish at that dinner it makes me a little sick!&nbsp;    &nbsp;   The food was good...I even got to try some dog-meat...tastes like turkey to me.&nbsp; It was kind of strange pointing to the roasted dog and then watching the guy chop up some parts...there were dumplings, various soups and chinese curries, fruits, cakes, deserts, and of course , the hot pot skewers...JKato and I drank and ate until we were basically imobile (by&nbsp;the way, kato again proved to me that Japanese, regardless of their size, can put down more food than any other people I have met).   &nbsp;   -------   &nbsp;   Due to various time and cost issues, I decided to hop a flight to Guilin the next day (save myself the 30+ hr train ride again).&nbsp; I didnt do much in Chengdu besides recover from my hotpot experience.&nbsp; I did spend a few hours in one of the tea-houses in The Peoples Park.&nbsp; They are really a nice way to kick back and relax (except for the guy trying to clean my ears and give me a massage every 30 min...very annoying).   &nbsp;   Finally able to post some more pics...but only a few.&nbsp; Just burned a CD and the computer has no cd rom, so only the most recent pics made it on...enjoy!

         So I have tried to write an update in 3 different towns over the past 3 days, and have been very unsuccessful.&nbsp; Computers here are pretty ghetto, especially after being in Japan.&nbsp; Its getting very annoying...   &nbsp;   The trip from Langmusi back to Chengdu took a day longer than Chengdu to Langmusi...I finally saw why so many people say travelling around these parts can be really difficult.&nbsp; Busses are unreliable, and the roads are terrible.&nbsp; But, as they say in japan, shyou ga nai!&nbsp; (it cant be helped).   &nbsp;   My journey started in Langmusi at around 6am.&nbsp; I was supposed to catch a bus to the next "town" (actually, it was just a fork in the road, with 2 restaraunts, a "hotel", and a small shop.&nbsp; After waiting for about 2.5 hrs and watching a few sheep and yak heards make their way down the street, I came to the conclusion my bus wasnt comming.&nbsp; The helpful lady at the hotel assured me that the bus to Zoige at the next town would wait for me, and I should just get on a taxi.&nbsp; Of course, there were no taxi drivers...she said they were all asleep now.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; Finally, an hour later, we (there was a german couple in the same sitaation) got a ride to the "town"...and you guessed it, there was no bus waiting for us.&nbsp; On top of that, 10 minutes later, the bus I wanted to take to that fork in the road shows up, dropping off another traveller that would turn out t obe my companion for the next few days...Kato-san from japan.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   To our luck, there was a young chinese couple from chengdu that spoke excellent english.&nbsp; They told us the next bus was going to come around 1pm.&nbsp; Instead of just hanging around ,they invited us to check out this local horse race in the village down the road a few minutes.&nbsp; Kato-san and I went, while the germans (an older couple) stayed behind.   &nbsp;   This horse race was honestly very uneventful and not to exciting.&nbsp; It was, however, really cool just hanging around all the local townspeople, watching and listeniging.&nbsp; The race itself had multiple heats of 5 riders...none of the races were close...but the winner got 5 bushells of Horse Tea (or something to that effect).&nbsp; Sweet!   &nbsp;   Before the race people slowly gathered in the field...the men in their oversized tibetan jackets on their Honda motercycles, the children in their school jumpers with snot running down their noses and icecream popsicles in hand, and the women in their colorful ethnic dresses.&nbsp; As soon as I pulled out my camera, the little kids went nuts! They could not get enough of it...being in pictures or taking them...and when they say my digital camera they were truly astonished.&nbsp; The instant feedback really got them going.&nbsp; Even the women would get into it, but generally were much shier than the kids.&nbsp; I laughed and played with them as the kids went from pose to pose...very fun.   &nbsp;   After a few hours of that we decided to head back to make our 1pm bus...we got there just as the bus arrived.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; All we had to do was grab our bags from the hotel we left them in and we were on our way.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; Except, the young female monk who ran the place was at the horse race festival with the keys...and we were stuck...again.&nbsp; Shyou ga nai!&nbsp; Next bus, around 4pm.   &nbsp;   Now we decided to chill at the fork in the road and get some eats.&nbsp; Lke I said in my last post, this area is Truly Tibet...and all the local fare is tibetan.&nbsp; We started out our lunch with Suyou-cha, Tibetan Yak-butter Tea.&nbsp; This a drink that Tibetanas have all the time...gives them energy supposedly.&nbsp; It is made from (you guessed it...) yak butter, horse tea, and some rice-based flour-esque stuff.&nbsp; It is sweet, and has a strong buttery taste...Ill pass...The other stuff we tried was Zamba...a playdoey substance made from the same ingredients as the tea...it tastes like a mixture of soil, playdoe, and yup, yak butter...Kato-san and I looked at eachother and decided the best thing to do was to dig into the 40cent beers and plain old noodles...much better.   &nbsp;   After lunch Kato-san started strumming on his guitar, attracting the attention of the whole fork-in-the-road.&nbsp; It was really cool seing the tibetans get down to some Japanese music.&nbsp; Music truly transcends all cultural boundries...I wish I could play the harmonica or something...   &nbsp;   At around 5pm the bus to Zoige finally showed up...it was the dirtiest smelliest bus I have been on yet.&nbsp; The guy sitting behind me was spitting out his lungs for the entire ride too (on the floor of course...)...I am sure I caught some type of cold on that bus.&nbsp; Curses!   &nbsp;   We got to zoige at night...found a cheap hotel, and had some grub.&nbsp; The locals got a kick out of us sweating and coughing as we tried to down their local spicy cuisine...ha ha ha...After spending the night we planned to catch a direct bus to Chengdu...so we got up an hour before the bus departure time (6:30) thinking we could get our tickets no problem.&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; Sold out literally 1 minute before I got to the ticket window.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; Our other option was to go back through Songpan.&nbsp; Time is so valuable when you travel that it really sucks having to back-track a few days...but, shyou ga nai!&nbsp; So we got on the bus and made the journey back.   &nbsp;   At songpan we were lucky to get a connecting bus to the small town of Maowen, set deep in the mountains along that fast moving river.&nbsp; Maowen is not even an afterthought in all the Chjina travel books, but it was quite nice staying there.&nbsp; I think it is home to the Qiang minority group, but I really am not sure.&nbsp; They looked and dressed completely different than the Tibetans.&nbsp; Their dress was almost persian-like.&nbsp; They had big head turbines and colorful vests...very beautiful.&nbsp; Our hotel was the grimiest dirtiest hole in the wall I have ever stayed in.&nbsp; The toilet caused me to almost lose my lunch from the past week a few times...dry heaves are the worst!   &nbsp;   We cruised around town that evening...and had dinner at this small outdoor stand.&nbsp; It was a mixture of frying and grilling skewered stuff...from eggplant to horse tripe...I think.&nbsp; It was really cheap and really good...lots of people just hanging around and eating.&nbsp; And even a good old fashioned drunken fight broke out with yelling, and broken beer bottles and crowds...very cool :)   &nbsp;   The next morning we finally got on a bus to Chengdu...what a journey.&nbsp; We got to Chengdu before noon, and the first thing I did when I got to the hostel was take a shower...It is amazing how different the weather is...just 2 days earlier I was freezing to death and now in Chengdu it was hot and humid.&nbsp; The other shock came from all the western clothing people were wearing.&nbsp; The last week I had been surrounded by small minority cultures in their colorful clothes and old traditions...the change is actually really shocking....   &nbsp;   ok...next update gets its own page...   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         After the horse trek in Songpan, I decided to make my way north into real Tibetan country to the town of Langmusi.&nbsp; Lets start at the begining...   &nbsp;   The bus ride from Songpan to Lanmusi is another long one...12 hours including a bus change in the town of Zoige.&nbsp; The road is not really a road, but just another dirt path...the busses are small and crowded.&nbsp; People smoke, spit on the floors, and eat sunflower seeds the entire way.&nbsp; The actual ride, although painful and uncomftorable, was increadibly beautfiul!!&nbsp;    &nbsp;   From Songpan you start to climb up into the mountains until you reach this incredible Grassland Plateu that stretches for miles.&nbsp; Thiis is already geographically part of the Tibetan plateu.&nbsp; Imagine the greenest of green fields stretching out to the horizon, with hills and mountains at the very edge.&nbsp; Yaks, horses, and sheeps are grazing everywhere...there are thousands of them.&nbsp; The landscape is dotted with tents, nomadic Tibetans.&nbsp; It was sooo beautiful.&nbsp; What I didnt understand is why they made the road so windy in an area that is sooo flat.&nbsp; It was supposedly 100 km or so from Songpan to Zoige, but my guess is that distance is how the crow flies...with the condition of the roads it took 6.5 hrs to get to Zoige.   &nbsp;   Zoige is a real small town in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; The first thing I noticed is that there are NO Han Chinese here...the town is Tibetan and Hui Chinese (muslim).&nbsp; Everyone wears these enormous Tibetan Jackets, Cowboy Hats, and a big knife tucked in their Shaft...real cowboys out here...despite what everyone in Songpan and even the Lonely Planet told us, there was actually a bus in the afternoon from Zoige to Langmusi...   &nbsp;   This ride was 80km and took 4.5 hrs...again, gorgeous ride as we climbed a hill at the edge of the grasslands and descended into a deep green valley surrounded by mountains...welcome to Langmusi!   &nbsp;   Langmusi, although geo-politically part of China (straddling Sizuan and Gansu Province), is Ethnically, Culturally, Religiously, and even Geographcially Tibet.&nbsp; People here do not speak Chinese, they speak tibetan...there are no Han chinese to be seen.&nbsp; Kim, my korean friend whom I met on the Horse trek (and my personal translator...this guy picked up chinese in 3 months!!!) said he felt scared sometimes because the Tibetan people think he is Chinese, and they really hate the chinese...on the flipside, the Han Chinese are scared to death of the Tibetan people (they carry knives!!), which is why the only tourists around here are "westerners".   &nbsp;   Langmusi is incredible...today was the first day I actually saw blue sky, and what a place to see it.&nbsp; All around is green...if you walk in 10 minutes in any direction you can find yourself in the middle of a green field, or at the bottom of a huge gorge, or the foot of a large moujntian!&nbsp; There are 2 large tibetan temples/schools here (one in Sizuan, 1 in Gansu), and they are living and breathing Tibet!!&nbsp; Monks and older men and women walk from prayer wheel to prayer wheel always spinning them clockwise...they circle holy buildings and relics (again, always clockwise).&nbsp; Some carry portable prayer wheels that they spin as they walik through the town, mumbling some tibetan prayers.   &nbsp;   At the top of one mountain I came across a Tibetan Sky Burial area.&nbsp; In buddhism, your physical body is just a vehicle for your soul/spirit.&nbsp; To contribute to the great karmic circle of life, the tibetans have a sky burial ritual...they chop the deceased body into small chunks and leave them for the vultures to devour.&nbsp; There was a ritual yesterday, and when I reached the burial grounds ther skeltal remains were still there.&nbsp; The Chinese Govt likes to refer to this ritual when trying to show how primative Tibetan Culture is...   &nbsp;   Moving over some more hills I spot a monk on top of a mountain throwing square colored pieces of paper with a picture of a horse and some tibetan writing on it into the air...he is doing this over and over agina, reciting some tantra along the way.&nbsp; This monk was very friendly, and let me try as well...then he gave Kim and I a tour of the monestary.&nbsp; What an incredible place!!&nbsp; The inside of the large temple hall was like nothing I have ever seen...soo many colors...later the monk took us to his house where we shared a cup of tea, took pictures, and talked (or rather, Kim tried to talk chinese with him, and then translated for me :) ).   &nbsp;   What a beautiful place...what friendly people...coming here it is easy to understand why Tibetan people want to split from China.&nbsp; It is ironic that the tibetan people here in Sizuan and Gansu province actually have more freedom than those living in Tibet...   &nbsp;   -------   &nbsp;   I wish I could stay here longer, but time is running out!! 1 month just doesnt cut it for China...I am going to make my way back to chengdu, stopping at Maerkang on the way to break things up.&nbsp; Then hopefully spend a few days in Yangshuo before making my way back to guangzhou...

         Just got back from my 4-day horse trek!&nbsp; What can I say, it was incredible!&nbsp; One of the most beautiful places I have ever been.&nbsp; The mountains here are huge!!&nbsp; Green, lush, and fertile down low, steep and snow capped up high.&nbsp; In many ways it reminds me of Wyoming or Colorado, but some of the trees are different...like pine trees, but the pine needles kind of drape over the branches...very beautiful.   &nbsp;   I am not sure what to write about...I wish I could post pictures.&nbsp; I will leave this one short...the guides were incredible smiling friendly and always singing.&nbsp; The scenary was spectacular!&nbsp; The food was great, but we were force fed too much of it.&nbsp; Tibetan prayer flags, yaks, and horses dot the landscape.&nbsp; It was good to be outdoors...away from the cities.&nbsp; Amazing...   &nbsp;   dan

         Believe it or not there is internet here in Songpan, and before I head off to a 4 day horse trek I wanted to write about todays journey...   &nbsp;   It was long...very long...It was on a very crowded bus....it was on a trecherous road winding along an even more trecherous river.&nbsp; The road had huge slabs of granite and other rock that fell from the towering mountains above...and the whole journey took 9 hours!! now my ass hurts.   &nbsp;   The ride was absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp; The mountains were shrouded in a heavy mist and cloud, and it was raining most of the day.&nbsp; With every bend of the river the mountains got steeper and taller...they are huge.&nbsp; Every now and then I could even catcha a glimpse of some snowy peaks in the distance.&nbsp; The most amazing part was that many of the mountains were terraced all the way to the top...the soil does not look friendly, but it was clear these mountains had been worked for years...&nbsp; The people on the bus were so nice...different faces than the common Han chinese face you get used to seeing here...I was treated to a delicious lunch on the way as well...   &nbsp;   Songpan is a large village of around 60,000 nesstled in the mountains.&nbsp; It is an area of a few minority cultures...Lehan, Tibetan, and Muslim.&nbsp; The elevation here, 2,900 meters, means a very strong sun, as evident by the super rosey cheeks everyone has, especially the woman.&nbsp; At first I thought it was make-up, but David, a friendly local who works at one of the tourist restaraunts, told me it wsa perma-burn.&nbsp; Songpan is also under massive construction, which is a shame as all the roads are basically dug-up mud pits now.&nbsp; But the colors here are incredible.&nbsp; The locals dress in very colorful robes...I hope I can snap some pics.&nbsp; Children are all smiles...the atmosphere here is very nice.   &nbsp;   I am going on a 4-day trek from tomorrow...cant wait!   &nbsp;   dan

         I am in Chengdu now which is yet another massive city.&nbsp; This city does have a slightly different feel than the other big cities I have been to, the pace is a little slower, but it still feels like a city.&nbsp; Instead of taxis, you can ride on 3-wheeled&nbsp;carts that are manually pedalled...very nice.&nbsp; The food is super spicey and super cheap...and there is a gigantic statue of my good friend&nbsp;Chairman Mao that&nbsp;is kind of watching over the city as it is being&nbsp;gutted...construction is everywhere here!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;I have had enough so am going to bypass Chengdu for now and head straight to Songpan tomorrow morning.&nbsp; They have these multi-day horse treks that I have only heard amazing things about.&nbsp; Songpan is in the northern Sizuan and is where the mountains start to appear...elevation climbs to over 2000 meters around here, and after Songpan I plan on trying to get to the tibetan haven of Langmusi, where the elevation I think tops out at around 4000 meters!!&nbsp; Beter buy that fake north face fleece soon!&nbsp; I will be lucky if I get a shower in the next week, so dont expect too much in the way of updates until I get back to Chengdu.&nbsp; I am hoping my shaolin legs feel beter, because until now I have managed to avoid the nasty squat toilets, but I think my luck is about to run out from what I hear...   &nbsp;   I just wanted to give my impression of the Chinese people so far.&nbsp; China, as you probably guessed, has lots of people.&nbsp; There are people everywhere.&nbsp; These people are very loud and not shy at all.&nbsp; A big smile can go a long way here as people generally seem friendly.&nbsp; On trains your bunkmates become your best friends.&nbsp; I would say they are even more social than in the states...certainly than Japan.&nbsp; I really wish I could speak the language!!&nbsp; I was so lucky to have studied Japanese and had the freedom to explore not only the sights of japan, but also the people because I could communicate.&nbsp; The only thing I can really say confidently here is Thank-you, and "I dont want it!"...not a good start for developing personal relationships.&nbsp; I have seen other travelers get really frustrated, and that frustration just gets reflected right back, but in a more aggresive manner.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with the notion of "face".&nbsp; The days of Mao hats and jackets seem long gone, at least in the big cities.&nbsp; Everywhere you go there is evidence of foriegn investments, from Macdonalds to Japanese department stores like Jusco.&nbsp; Consumerism is everywhere, and so are the homeless that I thought were supposed to be taken care of by The Peoples Government.&nbsp; The charm of city alleyways are being paved over by super-wide roads, and neon-clad pedestrian arcades.&nbsp; Some parts of the city look like skeletons during the day time, as they were specifically designed to be viewed at night.&nbsp; As soon as you duck into an alleyway it feels like you took a few steps backwards.&nbsp; Instead of high-rise concrete buildings you have crumbling apartments...instead of flourescent lit shops you have hawkers and small markets selling everything from leeche nuts to underware.&nbsp; This type of old marketplace inevitably spills out into the main "new" streets, but are diffused quickly.   &nbsp;   Eating here, like all of asia, is a really big deal.&nbsp; And the chinese dont mess around when it comes to food.&nbsp; The get down and dirty at dinner...there is no table etiquite that I have seen...I think if you dont leave your table a mess at a meal, it means that it was no good...food is cheap even by chinese standards, and unless I get out of the city I will become too fat to leave this country.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   What else...you can definetly feel a huge changes are sweeping through this country.&nbsp; I am itching to get into the countryside to see the other side of the coin.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Alright...over and out...   &nbsp;   dan

       Its been a few days since my last update...so I will try and bring you up to speed.  No pictures this time.  I still cant believe that the best computer facilities I have seen have been at the shaolin temple in a building that should probably be condemend for more than 1 reason...  So after my day of hard-core training I decided to practice the Shaolin Tourist Stance.  I hobbled out of my bed and made my way to the old Shaolin Temple, All Directions Meditation Hall, and the Pagoda Forest.  This was not a very pleasant experience, and not because of the incredible pain in my body from working out the previous day.  The Shaolin temple is under massive renovations so the entire area is a large construction site.  On top of that, it is overrun by chinese tourists.  As they say here in china, they like things Hot and Noisy...and that is what it was like.  Stalls selling everything from swords and prayer beads, to T-shirts and Mao Pins.  The chinese, like the Japanese, like to travel in large tourist group tours...with a guide and lots of cameras.  Also, walking through the grounds I realized that after more than 3 years in Japan I am really templed out!  I would not feel like I missed anything if I skipped more temples from here on out...there weren't even any moonks practicing kung-fu!! WEAK!  After the temples I thought about trying to climb a mountain to check out the Dharma Cave where chan (zen) buddhism apparently came to china...but my legs suggested I just go to my room and watch chinese soap-operas instead...I listened to my body.  My last night there I got together with the other 3 brits for a dinner at the hotel restaraunt...we ordered a feast and plenty of beers...food was ok, but it left me with a bit of a funny stomach that took about 2 days to settle...  The next day I hopped on a train to Guangzhou.  It was a 17hr trip on another sleeper train.  Again I got to meet some really nice people who spoke very good english.  There was one family of 3 (always 3 here...)...the father was a professor of Control Systems...so we had stuff to talk about.  Very interesting...  Now I am in Guangzhou, and I am still soar!!!  Damn shaolin!  My main reason for swinging through Guangzhou is to hang out with my very good friends Mickey and Dovie.  They have been incredible hosts and it is always good to hang out with these guys.  I always feel so lucky to be able to call this beautiful couple my good friends!  Thanks guys for everything!! (except your damn cats :) )  Dovie works for the foreign service and is now responsible for deciding who gets immigrant visas and who doesnt...sounds pretty stressful to me.  They have an amazing place in the US Consulate General...it is also connected to the White Swan Hotel (a very posh hotel here)...and they have access to some of the facilities, like the pool and hot-tub!  Good stuff...nice to see where some of my tax dollars are going.  They took me out sat. night for a night on the town...quite the experience.  The highlight definetly was Tang Club.  A large 4 story building with a live band on the bottom floor.  Picture this...a band of cubans (I think...) all dressed in snazzy blue jackets and dancing like the 4-tops during the numbers...but the song selection was the best part.  When they broke into Men at Work and Dire Straights, they had the room hopping!  It is quite a site to see the local ex-pat crowd grinding to Queen...I guess you have to make due with what you got...my tokyo brothers would not approve of the night life here!  This morning I walked along the pearl river and watched the retired population practicing tai-chi, among other exercises.  Some use swords, some use fans, some empty handed...then there is the high-energy tai-chi that looks more like a cross between dancing and arobics...and then there are the people that are walking backwards, spinning in circles, waving their arms in strange motions, rubbing their faces over and over and over...it actually feels a bit like a looney-bin here...but on the other hand it is really nice to see so many people just outside trying to exercise.  ------  Tomorrow I hop on a flight to Chengdu.  After much consultation and thinking, it seemed like the best idea to fly instead of braving the 30+ hr train ride.  Chengdu is in Sizuan Province and will be the launching pad of hopefully a very scenic and authentic part of China.  Apparently lots of Tibetan culture to be found in the mountains of Sizuan.  Maybe I will find some capable computers in some tibetan monestary and get some more pics up....  see ya...

       OK.  I dont even know where to start.  This place is absolutely incerdible!  I feel like I am in a National Geographic magazine. I am staying in a legitmate kung-fu school. These kids train about 9 hours a day!  It is run like a boot camp.  Red shirts come pouring out into the open=air courtyard at like 5:15am at the sound of a blaring PA system pumping out some scratchy old chinese horn.  Formations are made, most likely by grade (age), and training begins.  Usually running and stretching.  Then throughout the day all sorts of crazy weapons come out, boxing gloves and kicking pads, big mats, you name it.  This place is HARD CORE!  The "cafeteria" is just some small stalls with simple foods like dumplings, various steamed and fried breads, rice and vegetables, and the very popular watermelon!  You can eat 3 good meals a day for under $1!  Incerdible.  The kids are all smiles as you wonder around...if you stand still long enough you will find yourself surrounded by red shirted 8 year olds, carrying their bags and weapons, just looking at you.  Apparently, there is supposed to be lots of tourism here, but I havent seen out.  Around noon, some chinese tourists show up for the Kung-Fu demonstration, but after that its just pure training.  Now on to my day.  I paid for a full day of training...and now I am in more pain than I can explain.  Here is a run down of the day  5:00  Wake up...sun is not out yet, and trying not to cringe at the whiney trumpet.  5:25  My trainer shows up, and me, Ed (a british dude also training for the first day), and a crazy guy from Amsterdam who has been here 7months start our jog.  The sun is rising behind the mountains, there are hundreds of red shirts jogging in formation around me, and I am thinking this is the coolest thing ever.  This, of course, lasts about 2 minutes.  After that I start panting and cursing my out of shape fat body.  5:45  We arrive to the outside courtyard of one of the old shaolin temples, and for about 40 minutes we learn various stances, punches and kicks...my legs are trembling...I havent worked out like this in a long time, and it is not even morning!  6:00  Breakfast...like I described above  7:30  (ok...losing track of time now...)  We go into the "foreigner" training room.  Me and the other 2 dudes, Johnny and a chick just got here 2 days ago, the chick is an anthropologist spending 3 months here, and 2 japanese guys, 1 who has been here 2 years, one for 1 month.  We start more stretching, stance, and kicking drills.  Then we move on to learning the Continous Form, or something like that.  Although physically my body was in much pain, I was happy to see that my previous martial arts training helped me pick up moves much faster than my beginner counterparts.  Not to brag or anything ;)  Ok...this time schedule thing is taking too long.  Basically, we trained until 11, had a long 3 hr break, and then trianed again until 6:30.  I am wrecked now.  I was planning on doing some hiking and tourist stuff, but I will be lucky if I can walk tomorrow!  Alright...signing off...  dan   urlLink    Me sporting my Shaolin trainer, and my shadow boxing stance!&nbsp; urlLink

         My last day in Shanghai felt more like killing time until my train ride.&nbsp; I did the touristy thing...did the Bund Tourist "Psychedellic" tunnel, and also went to the top of the tallest building in China.&nbsp; It is actually pretty cool.&nbsp; The top 35 floors or so belong to the hyatt hotel, and has the largest atrium in the world.&nbsp; Think of the scene in Starwars I or II when JarJar Binks gives power to the evil dude...Anyway, the top of the building gives an extraordinary view of Shanghai.&nbsp; It is a very very big city.   &nbsp;   In the afternoon the clouds finally cleared up and I actually saw the sun for the first time.&nbsp; Shanghai can be very beautiful under blue skies.&nbsp; The rest of my day was spent waiting for my train to ZhengZhou.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   The Shanghai train station is incredible.&nbsp; It is an absolute madhouse.&nbsp; People everywhere, and has a very cold, communist feel to it.&nbsp; My train was an overnight train...13hr trip.&nbsp; The cars are filled with 3=level bunk beds.&nbsp; The chinese like to chat, a very stark difference to train behaviour in Japan.&nbsp; I met 2 nice chinese men who spoke english.&nbsp; We shared a beer, shared some laughs, and then went to sleep.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   One of the guys was from Zhengzhou, and he proved to be a real life savor for me.&nbsp; He helped me buy my train ticket to Guangzhou (which I leave for on Friday), and sort out my bus ticket to Shaolin-shi.&nbsp; On top of that, he and his friend treated me to an amazing lunch...Nice guy...   &nbsp;   So now I am in the rattiest smelliest hotel I have ever seen.&nbsp; But it doesnt matter, because I am in the middle of the largest Kung-Fu school in the world!&nbsp; I spent the entire afternoon watching literally thousands of kids from age 4 to 26 practicing outside.&nbsp; The training grounds reek of urine and are surrounded by rouble and collapsed buildings.&nbsp; Kind of strange...   &nbsp;   Tomorrow I start my full day of kung-fu training!&nbsp; Kick Ass!!! only costs 12 bucks...   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   dan

        urlLink     &nbsp;  After spending the better part of 3 and a half years in asia, with only a few visits back home, it feels real nice to be back in the "western" world.&nbsp;&nbsp; People here look like me, signs are in English, and the food looks familiar.&nbsp; However, there are enough things here in Oz that are different enough to make things a bit unsettling at times.&nbsp; Entres are appetizers, Hungry Jacks is Burger King, koalas on the road, and everyone talks funny here.&nbsp; I look around and swear I am back in America sometimes, but everything has an Aussie twist that is just different.&nbsp; TV and radio here is terrible...every bad commerical, song, and TV show is redone here with an Aussie accent.&nbsp; The #1 song on the top 40 here last week was from a Christan Rock Band and Big Brother is the top show on TV.&nbsp; Many American scrubs in the music and sports industry come here and take off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, none of this is meant as a slight to my aussie friends :) &nbsp; The people here are super friendly, and the landscape is stunning.&nbsp; I just spent a weekend on the Great Ocean Road outside of Melbourne.&nbsp; The coast is incredible, and I have&nbsp;never seen as many rainbows in my life as I did this past weekend.&nbsp; I can understand why my sister doesnt want to leave this place!&nbsp; Sydney is a beautiful and clean city with wonderful bush walks and great weather (while I have been here...). &nbsp; ---- &nbsp; In just over a week I will be back home in the US...I actually can't wait.&nbsp; First order of business will be a slice of NY Style pizza!!&nbsp; Sorry, but Australia scores only a few points higher in the Pizza department than Japan....and that is not saying much.

       Unfortunatly, my last 2 days in Bali left a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth... A very elaborate motor-bike scam took me for a lot of money, and I also got a bit fed up with people trying to sell me stuff...it was a bit much.  Its too bad, because overall I really enjoyed Bali and would love to come back.  Now I am in Australia, trying to recover from a nasty cold.  Sydney seems like a beautiful city, and my sisters town of Manly is gorgeous.  Once I kick this cold I will be ready for some exploring.

       Last 4 days have been incredible....  Long straight roads lined with tall coconut trees.  Deep blue ocean with black sands, and looming volcanoes dominating the center of the island.  Empty beeches and total seclusion, beautiful sunsets and amazing stargazing.  A small fishing village where everyone is smiles, the fisherman like to drink before they work, and the kids are just magic.  A long drive to the top of a volcano with a crater lake and some bike problems...  Bali is really an amazing place...like everywhere else, I wish I could spend more time here.  2 more days and its off to Sydney!!

       One of the real pleasures of having your own transport is the freedom to stop where and when you please.  Renting this motor bike really makes me miss my trips on pedals...ultimate freedom.  As I was zooming up the roads I passed a procession/parade of locals dressed up in what must be their best.  I pulled my bike over and followed them.    Now is the time in Bali where they have what is known as the Cremation Ceremony (Bali is Hindi, but they have alot of unique local flavor to their religion that is different from India).  From what I gathered, they dig up the bones from graves that are 3 years old, and over the course of the next weeek will burn them.  The grave digging involves lots of cheering and offererings of various stuff, from rice to flowers to alcohol.  There is balanese music (gamelan...lots of bells and drums...really cool) and the atmosphere is actually very festive.  I walked around the grounds, took lots of pics, and got to chat with the always smiling and very friendly locals.  I was the only white guy and people defintly noticed me.  It was funny, cause in Ubud, they were offering toured services for 50,000 rpl (the currency here is mad) to see the same thing...  It was really interesting and I am glad I got to see it.  After hanging out there and having some eats I continued on to Padang Bai, where I am now....

       On the beautiful Island of Bali now... After a very nice flight on Garuda Airlines, I got into Bali at around 9pm.  Rather then spend the night at the surfer/party/tourist haven of Kuta, I decided to head straight to the "Culinary and Cultural capital of Bali", Ubud.  I love the fact that this island is small enough to get anywhere in an hour...soooo much nicer than those 12hr+ bus/train rides earlier in my trip.  Anyway, Ubud is really hyped up in the lonely planet, but I wasnt too impressed.  It is a small town filled with honeymooners and japanese tourists (the auzies are surfin their waves...).  The place is lined with arts and crafts stores, galleries, and restaraunts.  Its a nice place if you are into shopping and getting "authentic" looking souveniers.  In fact, I am sure you can get some really nice stuff here, but I hate shopping...never have liked it...I never know what to do.   I saw the monkey sanctuary, biked around beautiful rice fields lined with coconut trees, and capped my evening off with some traditional balanese dance.  Bali is more expensive than Thailand and China and my days of $1 meals or less are definetly over...the food is good, but I would rather be in China for the eats.  I thought I would spend 2 days in Ubud but quickly realized there is not much that interests me here.  So, I am trying something different.  I rented a motorbike for 4 days and am going to cruise the island at my own pace, without having to deal with the hassle of tourist groups, price negotiations, and no AC.  The bike is cheap...only $4/day (with insurance)...I picked up a nice little overtheshoulder bag and filled it with a bathing suite, towel ,and toilet paper and cruised away...  Just as I got the hang of riding this thing, cruising at 70km/hr, enjoying the blue skies, puffy white clouds, tall green coconut trees, flat rice paddies, locals in batiks, a white dog decides to stroll out into the road.  I couldnt avoid it, I swear...a collision, crash, dog whinning, me trying to figure out what is going on...the dog is ok...in fact he seems much better off than I.  I limped off the word not feeling any pain yet because adrenaline was still pumping through me.  Before I even got my bike off the road a local shop owner rushed to my aide with a small bottle of iodine.  just a scrape on my left arm, and probably a really big bruise on my left thigh...a couple of nods of disapproval from some locals, but everyone was generally really nice and helpful.  When the adrenaline wore off the pain settled in just a bit...and then to add insult to injury I found out I was going in the wrong direction!  Hard to do on an island this small...  Anyway, got back on my back and sped off towards the east side of the island...

       Thailand really blew by me...it almost feels like I didnt really do anything.  This is my 2nd time here and I still haven't done Thailand right...its always kind of been a stopover to some other destination.  The Thai people are still some of the friendliest people I have met.  The way the greet eachother has to be the warmest, most sincere greeting in the world.  Everything really slows down when you say hello here...they look you in the eye with a warm smile, hands clasped together in a Buddhist pose, and finish with a friendly Sawadi Kaap (not sure on the spelling).  I could spend my days just saying hi to people here...  Anyway, I couldnt really do anythin in Bangkok today because I hit my first major travel issue.  Somehow I managed to loose one of my travellers Cheque Books...a bit of a headache dealing with it all...but luckily China was even cheaper than I thought and I should have enough cash to make it to Oz where I can mooch off my sister for the rest of the time...  Onward to Bali tomorrow...now if only I could find a cheap Bali guide book...

       Now I am recovering from one of the craziest parties I have ever seen.  The Full Moon Party on Ko Pha-Ngam delivers.  It is a massive and wild mess of kids getting wasted on everything imaginable.  The entire Hat Rin Beach is transformed into a large dance floor with different musical venues to satisfy almost anyone.  It is not the best party I have been to, but certainly one of the most massive and out of control ones I have seen.  I am not sure what I think of the whole event...there is no way that beach will be able to sustain that kind of debauchary very long.  The place gets absolutely trashed, and it is almost sad to think about what might become of what is otherwise a really beautiful beach.  Anyway, it was good fun.  Now I am on my way back to Bangkok for one more day in Thailand.  My time here was a blur...too short really.  1 week is not enough time to do anything!

        urlLink     What a great way to ease back into America... Old friends and lots of booze. Jim's wedding was beautiful, and the reception was high-class.  The SUV limo for the wedding party was a very nice touch.   Congradulations to the both of yas!  It was great to hang with some old friends too.   My MIT boys and girl...good to have some laughs and forget about my jetlag and all those intimidating foreigners that I have to deal with now.  Kowaii!!  The pizza is good, the beer even better, and the weather is beautiful.  Time to relax....
