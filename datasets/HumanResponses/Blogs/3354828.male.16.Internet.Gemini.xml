        I hope you guys can read this, I just wanted to say that the WASL, was A LOT easier than I thought. So it's ok. Everyone was all making a big deal about it. Maybe the second half is harder we have 3 periods straight taking it. So now we have another 3.

        Ugh my throat hurts. After we went swimming me Dawn, and Ian went for pizza, then we came home and watched a movie. And finally he went home and here I am. You all know Dawn in my sister right? Just for those who don't know.....I was gonna bring Michelle too but she forgot. Then I was gonna bring Carli, but I didn't give her enough notice. Soooo yeah. AND I have a dance this Friday, the last one with the 7th and 8th graders combined. Then we have one just 8th graders at the high school. Woo the theme for the dance is like....A night in Paradise. Maybe I should wear a turban and a toga. Lol, that would be interesting. I need to think of some songs to put down on my cd, but every time I ask someone they say songs I already have....DAMN YOU PEOPLE I HAVE ASKED!! Well I'm gonna go look for some more songs I like.

        Oook Well I'm in class it's 5th period It's gonna be lunch in 11 minutes. And I'm kinda going back and forth between working and goofing off. No one minds though. I have Jazz combo today after I eat lunch which is when I go in for my lunch break and play music with some other select players. I think I'm gonna join the talent show and play Jazz Improv. On my clarinet. It should be fun. I wonder if I'll be able to do it.....oh well! Well I'm gonna go, lata playas

So at least now he knows who I am. I think I'm gonna drop the crush and persue my real dream....=D they know who they are, and I don't even know if they're reading this lately. Soo yeah.

         Ugh I'm in such a bad mood. I think I'm gonna die because everything is bugging me. I need to like....go to sleep and vent on someone. But it's so damn hot in here. It's like 79-81 degrees F. Ugh....I've been sucking and rubbing ice cubes on me all day. I kept spelling "cubes" "cubs" too. Lol. I think everyone knew and didn't correct me. Oh well I think I'm gonna go lie down. Lata playas

         Oook I'm running out of colors. I don't even know if this is a real color! Oh well it should still show up.....I hope. I'm in the library since I forgot money for lunch....so hungry..... Well nothings going down here there's only two people in here....make that three. Ok four. And there's another class in a seperate room.....They're 7th graders. I never got to go in there for MY communication classes.....How unfair. Well it was also a different teacher. Since I'm in band, Jazz band and AVID, I can't be in social studies or an encore class. Since you only get two. Which is why I don't have social studies. Well I have WASL testing on thursay and friday (Washington Assesment Student Learning) Ugh....It's the science WASL, I'm gonna crash and burn on it. My math teacher was going to show us a copy of the 10th grade WASL, but someone was talking........I'm not saying who....*cough* George *cough*. Oh sorry, I think I'm coming down with something....:D Well I gotta go. ^_^

Good thing I wore a sports bra underneath....phew. We weren't the only people there though.....and I brought some friends. *sigh* they couldn't stop laughing....until I made them lol, j/k.

And the 7th graders are in the library also....boy are they noisey. But the one I 'kinda' like is in here. The one I like because they remind me of someone I really really like. Ya know? Am I the only one in the world that does this.....Ah well, it's only looks-wise, I don't even know the guy....I'm weird huh? Well I'm gonna go do other things.....Bye!

My next class is Jazz band but in Concert Band our director (Ms. McFeely) Gave up and said she was done for the day....and we waited in class for the last 5-10 minutes waiting for the bell to ring.....It was scary. Now I'm kinda scared to go back =S. Well....Wish me luck!

        Oy, today was harsh, the days go by soooo slooow when it's close to summer. Jeez....two more months exactly in 4 days. I don't know if I can last! =(   Language Arts Well we didn't do anything in that class what really went down was passing time (the time I get to go from one class to the next)  Language Arts to Math Passing Time (4 minutes after class ends) Well I saw Andrew* and Josh*. Krista likes Josh * and I kinda like Andrew*, But I only like Andrew* because he reminds me of someone else I really like....only in looks. I don't even really know Andrew* = \ Weird huh?   Math We took notes on this whole other theory, irrational numbers, which we've talked about but havn't really looked into. And I finally understand what they really ARE. And we got a really long homework assignment. 6-26 even numbers only. and we have a review sheet. We actually learned all this stuff last year. Mr. Roberts is just trying to get us ready for high school.  Passing Time Math to Science (4 min.) I saw Anndrew again, but he didn't see me. I saw Krista look at Josh* too, it's kinda funny when she asks me all about him, when I really have no clue who he really is. Odd I know.   Science God this class is boring, well not really boring, the teacher just makes it boring his name is Mr. Moore btw (A.K.A Mr. Snooore) we're just filling out the blanks in worksheets and he's giving us the answers. But me and Krista actually just wrote notes back in forth since we sit next to each other every day. The notes were mainly about "Who likes Krista" "who Krista should go to the dance with" "What she should do" And I give her a lot of advice, which is weird, since I need to listen to the advice I'm giving, so I won't make fun of her if she can't do anything about her crush, since I wouldn't be able to do anything about mine. But I can talk to her crushes just fine....maybe she could talk to mine. Maaaaybe not, I don't think I want them talking to Krista, I'm a very possessive person.   Passing time from Science to Concert Band Lol I said hi to Austin, who is a seventh grader that Krista knows, and I only know his name because we went to the same elementry school, only....he doesn't know mine lol, so I just mess with him ^_^ Quite fun really.  Concert Band We got a new piece and she can't decide between these two pieces one is called Quintero the other is like.....Shining of the Stars or something....I like Quintero better because I like playing in 5/4 time.   Passing time from Concert Band to AVID Well nothing really happened here, I said hi to Krista, Carli, Kelli, Ian and some others that I saw. But that's about it  AVID We had a guest speaker today. A congress man for our district, He was kinda cool, and I was a panel person (there was like 10 people out of the class that actually got to talk to him...all hand-picked) Which reminds me, I have to write a thank you letter to him. He talked to me after class, he congragulated me on something only I don't really know what it is....ah well.   Lunch I tried to eat fast and get to the library and meet Krista and Alisha, we were using the computers together to check our e-mail. We wrote back and forth for a while until 5 minutes before the bell, when we went outside and waited for Ryan to come out, Only when he did, it didn't go according to plan, so we'll probably do it tomorrow.  Jazz Band Ohhh this was really fun, we started all new stuff, we got two new songs, One is like Pamalaya. the other is......Pink Panther! Which we begged her to get. WOoOoOo, after that we worked it out, but I had to switch with the other Tenor Sax player (Michelle) Because she can't play the "low notes" see, I had the first part, but she took it. Oh well I still have a cool part either way, so it's cool.   Passing time from Jazz Band to P.E Oy nothing happened here, I just....walked to the gym lol.  P.E All we did here was another pacer test (last of the year!! WOoo) I beat my old score, Krista beat her brother,and ummm Becca and Amie are totally awesome, they seem to think i'm the funniest person on the planet....weird....well i'm done woooo

Which reminds me...I still havn't finished Eragon....I'd like to sometime. But I'll have to get the book from somewhere. I liked that book quite a lot too.

Instead of having to enter the tags and stuff...And now you can enter pictures directly from your thingy instead of going through an ftp. Which...I think you had to do, but I'm not entirely sure.
