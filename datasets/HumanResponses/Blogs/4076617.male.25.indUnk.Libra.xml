      I was reading about the chaos theory tonight. It seems that it is a very interesting subject. To me it seems that it may be impossible to ever figure out such a complex and diverse train of thought. When it comes down to it there is really no possible way to make a mathematical formula because it is not really based on mathematics in the end being so random and depending on so many factors given the circumstances of any said situation. When I began reading I knew really nothing of the theory and now it seems I know little more. I mean when people are trying to figure this out what really could they unlock with such a endless knowledge of the unexplained.&nbsp;&nbsp;If someday they would figure this out the possibilities are endless, I mean say they figure out how to write this down or just how to apply it&nbsp;(I dought it could happen), they could solve some of the questions that make the universe, how our bodies and environment change, and really how the process of our own free will is determined. I feel that if this was the case it could mean the beginning and end of it all. If you have never read into the subject I would recommend it just to open your mind to something new.

      well today me and a few friends went to the county fair.... Had some fun watched the demolition derby, saw a fist fight (involving around 6-8 people) which was started by the referees decision on the second event (heh what did you expect from a bunch of rednecks in Ohio lmao). Right after all that I had to go and talk to someone, well here goes. Ok, my little sister and cousin (both of them are 14years old) have pretty much been hanging at the fair for the first few days it was open I mean aint shit to do around here so I don't blame them. They both came up to me and told me about this guy that worked at a game stand that had been making some rude comments to them. So I asked them to tell me what was going on. They said this guy keeps hitting on them and was asking them to go out and shit like that (turns out this guy is 27 years old). So being the big brother I had them point the guy out and I proceeded to talk to him , I could tell right off the bat the guy looked like a weasel and I would just tear his head off. Iasked him if he's every seen them before. He says yeah he's seen them around. So to make a long story short I told him how these 2 girls were related to me and that they were both in my heart. I told him that he didn't need to talk to them anymore during the duration of the fair and that if they had any problems that I would be back and that he didn't want me to come back there. He said well its my job to talk to all the people that's how I make money, My response was that he needed to especially make it his job not to talk to these 2 girls because if I return it will not be a good thing and to accept this little talk we had as a warning. I mean I really don't think I was out of line being as my sis and cousin are so young and this guy was making remarks to them. Actually I wanted to just pull the guy out of his little game stand and beat his fuckin face in to the point his mother wouldn't recognize him. So in the end this jerkoff had me steamed the rest of the night and kinda ruined my fun day at the fair. I have told my sis and cousin that if this guy even says a word to them to tell me, as I will resort to (PLAN B) and resume with the beating he needs, regardless of the consequences. In closing if anyone reads this please post any thoughts on the matter, I mean think about if it were your little sis and cousin, or even someone else u love having this done to them.
