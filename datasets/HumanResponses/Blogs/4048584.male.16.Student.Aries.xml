Later guys and gals! once i get back home, im going to have alot of gifts to give out. so enjoy all! im still scrambling to find gifts, like shot glasses, and according to my host family they dont have shot glasses, so ill find a sake glass that looks like a shot glass.

       well its official, ive been kicked out of high school in japan, because of my studness. well not really i got kicked out of high school because a certian teacher who i had been meeting has left to go to his vacation, and i cant go to the high school (which by the way in my opinion is stupid) and heres quote on quote "please find something else to do" when an english teacher at the high school was translating the words from a japanese teacher... oh well i didnt know i wasnt supposed to be in the school, neither did my host family. it wasnt our fault! we thought if that teacher wasnt at the school, i couldnt go swimming. oh well screw them. ive got less than a week left and im going to rock the rest of my time here by shopping for all you friends! sorry i cant find shot glasses, but i can find sake glasses... ok for you guys? they look like shot glasses except theyre not clear and theyre for sake (hence the name sake glasses)... oh well thats all for now!

       Hello all if your wondering why I havent been on AIM... It's for a sad/depressing reason. My grandfather who is around 80ish has to go soon (very saddening for me since ive known him all my life and hes my last of my grandparents to survivie). but hey what can we do? thats life... we cant do anything about it either... which kinda its sucky.... its just hard for me to see my last grandparent to see him on that hospital bed just sleeping and not doing so well... well this is jason, signing off from NYC... Peace. Best of luck to all!

       well all i know i have to think about the future, but i just cant stop thinking about the life i made here in japan, the friends, breaking down the language barrier and the strong bond that my HF and i share. im going to miss all of this life. reflecting back i wish i had more time in japan. thats my only wish more time in japan. even though that may hurt some of your feelings, my friends, but its true i wish i had more time to bridge bigger gaps between my chinese/american culture, and the japanese culutre. its just so sad that i have to leave after what seems to me of 1 week of deep submersion in the japanese culture. im just sad i only have 1 more full day...
