      Today's a very happy day!!  My best friend Shauna came over this morning and woke me up at 8:30!!,  but I was still pumped to see her...it's 2 weeks since we've hung out!  Craziness!  So I was pumped about that,  plus the fact that I got my pictures from camp...and they are awesome!  So many good memories,  right stoked for next year t0o.   Can't wait to see all the Peggers next time I'm in the city.  We'll hit the bars...I might be able to pass for 18.  We'll see won't we?        So yeah me and my boyfriend just broke up over stupid fucking people that don't know how to tell the truth.  Not sure whats going to happen.  He hates me right now.  I'd really like to still be friends with him but I think it's going to take a while for that to happen.  I fucked up really bad and I am really sorry for the shit I've caused.  Not exactly sure whats going to happen with the guy I met.  Quite interested at the moment,  hope he feels the same way too.  Maybe,  maybe not.  We'll see about that as well.        Still missin' all ma buddehs....talk to everyone soon.  MUAH!!
