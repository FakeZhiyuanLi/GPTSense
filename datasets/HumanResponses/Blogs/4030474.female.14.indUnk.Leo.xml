       this week is so arg! though there is quite little homework and a bit slack, this week sux cause i screwed it up..totally...why didn't i think before i said it...sigh* now i'm being thought as a irritating brat who dosent keep her promises...that sux! sigh* now i dunno wad to do and sigh* WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO....? apologise? i already did..maybe i didn't sound sincere enough..mayb...ok...i do keep promises..but i make mistakes sometimes...it's not that i dun want to go..it's juz that its another thing...another thing...i know you dun get it...i noe you're still mad at me...i think...but i hope not...*cryz* ...anyway...next week's a killer with oral,maths and scinece tests..hope i can do well...from wad my bro juz told me about oral...i am super scared now...i gonna fail my chinese..thinking of dropping HCL, cause i noe i am not fit to me in...cause the highest i EVER got was 59.9..which is like lousy...super lousy...chao lousy...right...and the worset thing is that year end exam is 2A and 2B...before i even start traking my final year...i could like juz disappear from the face of the earth...sigh* how i really wish to be like Liz..you control your own time and not pple control the time for you...you decide wad to do and not others. rite..and the government says that this is a "good education system" :S...right...guess there would be more metal cases, more teenagers committing sucide and pple going crazy...pple would juz stress themselves....and juz forgetting wad is the meaning of life...life would juz be no meaning.....everyday, you study like crazy cause you want to get the best mark, better than your friends. sigh* wad is the world coming to? a better world? BLEAX! you call this a better education system? right...pple get smarter...get stressed and die faster...die of stress rather than old age.sigh* hope the second coming of Jesus is nearing, so He'll take away all our sufferings and we'll be in heaven worshipping Him day and night... =)
