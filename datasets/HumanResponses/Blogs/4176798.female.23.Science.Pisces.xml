       It is a proven fact : i cannot stay in the same place for more than a few hours without loosing my mind. im not joking either.ive been home for 2 days and im already depressed. the house is a mess, the dishes are piled up in the sink, and instead of taking care of all that im sitting here in front of my computer typing a letter to nobody bitching about my life,,,,,,,,, makes a whole lot of gaddam sense, right?it seems to me that i get like this whenever scott has to work and im left here with the kids. it wouldnt be so bad if he wasnt working nights. i hate sleeping alone. and because im working on his off days i really dont ever see him and it makes me feel so lonely.geez i guess i dont have much to say now...................................

       so it has been one long day... my daughter has been sick and in one of those moods where she wants to be held all day. so of corse nothing got done as far as housework or anything else for that matter. although i did make an appointment with my dermatologist for monday. ive got a place on my shoulder that has come up and im pretty sure its a skin cancer. so im gonna get that sucker removed mui el pronto.If i havent mentioned this befor. im a diabetic and have some serious kidney problems. my doctor says if i can loose alot of weight the kidneys may heal themselves and i wont need a transplant. ive been threatened with diyalisis many times but i know once it starts i won heal at all and i might aswell just give up.i like to have some kinda hope.ive been dealing with myself stuffing my face almost compulsively lately.i dont know why. its period week and i tend to munch alot then and i started back working this week too more satress but i definately needed to get out of the house. i am sooooooo not a stay at home mom. i love my babies, i really do, but domestic goddes just isnt in the cards for me.i need to be around other adults and talk about things other than sesame street  and peanut butter sandwiches. i didnt even mind the 12 hour shifts!id go in first thing in the morning bright eyed and all fresh feeling. with my huge 24 once raspberry mocha coffe feelin glorious.i am so totally back on the caffine bandwagon.. when i first started having kidney problems i quit drinking caffine and pretty much anything that wasnt watter... but now its a must have if im going to work.im worried im going to start gaining weight again though. i lost like 30 pounds a month ago but have been even for a while.not gainng but havent been making an effort to loose really either.i need to. of corse i need several things....... but that is for another time.....................

        so scott and i went through this period where we never NEVER had sex.EVER. then when we started again it was so-so, but usually the tv was on and it was a half-hearted attemtpt at best.so we started researching tantric sex. well actually , i started researchign it and e mailing the articles to him. urlLink http://www.tantra.com . i didnt really see much of a difference at first. e tried and i tried but mentally it just wasnt happening. i was having to go to the bathroom and finish myself off after it was all over because i faked it quite a few times.i think really and truly i was treying to hard and being too serious about it. i mean its not like scott was the first man i ever slept with. There were a few. ok more than a few but not so much that i should be so bored with it already right? anyhow.......about 2 weeks ago we finally had a breakthrough. nobody tried to do anything in particular and it was intense!!!!! i mean  HOT HOT HOT  ! it had never been that way with him. our sex life has always been ok. but nothing i would deem earth moving. but im totally in love with him so the sex wasnt an issue with me.untill we stoped. then i turned into a supernympho.lol!!!!! i couldnt get enough.well the other night we had an expierience i am not soon to forget. we didnt have sex, he just went down on me. this isnt unusual for him, he likes to give, and i like to recieve, and it is usually pretty good but this time was incredible, that dosent even do it justice!!!!!i cant even describe what he was doing, and i mean it must have went on for an hour or better but i mean my legs were shaking and quivering and i was speaking jibberish and at one point i coudlnt breathe and forgot where the hell i was!!!!then, at the BIG FINISH i think i passed out. i know you think im full of shit but its true!!!!i dont know if it was the books on tantra, the fact that i ( and he) finally just let go or what but whatever it was it worked.

        ok, so i admit it , i met my husband on the internet. but heres ther funny part, neither one of us are those pathetic people that usually cruise the internet for a date( not everyone who does this is pathetic, but generally speaking its still a weird way to meet somone with all the whackos out there). i had maybe been out with one other guy i met online, and he worked with a girlfriend of mine so i had her check him out first so i dont really count that one. anyhoo, i met him online one night in a yahoo chatroom. he made some smartass coment about my screen name and i told him to fuck off, but every time i got online thereafter he would always im me to say hello or something. after about a month of ignoring his ims i got online really late one night and he was the only one on.so i talked to him. i mean really talked..for like four hours. he was so smart and funny and interesting.after talking online for about 2 weeks, and never admiting to anyone i was starting to develop a huge crush on this guy who i didnt even know what he looked like!!!i finally gave in and we exchanged phone numbers and began talking on the phone. and of corsewe talked alot. hours at a time usually 4 times a week, with a few shorter calls here and there. this went on for about a month or so and his birthday was coming up and he said the only thing he wanted was to meet me. of corse i was so nervous, id never even seen a picture of this guy, what if he was creepy, or i was not really his type, so many things ran through my mind really. but after a week he convinced me. he lived about an hour and a half from where i was living at the time. i had never been to his town befor so i got lost on the way there, but eventually found myway. when i pulled upto his apartment, i almost turned around and left because i was a little scared to meet him, here i was in the middle fo nowhere at this guys apartment and no one knew him or where i was!!! anyhoo. i got the nerve to walk up to the door and give it a knock and he waspractically waiting by the door for me.lol. i could tell he was nervous to , but i was glad to see he didnt look like a creep and he apeared to be just as nervous about meeting me as i was about meeting him. he will deny that  to this day, but its true.the first thing that impressed me about him was, when we walked into his living room, there were four huge bookcases,overflowing qwith books, and the spines were all bent, so i know he read them,.he loved hunter s thompson( im a huge fan as well) and philosophy and we just sat on his couch and talked for hours.i really felt like i was in the right place. i dont have to tell you that we ended up sleeping together that night ( i know i am such a whore!!!).we got dressed after and went and got frosties and drove around for hours talking. i feel for him so hard,so of corse, i did the asme thing any person who found their soul mate would do. i ran. i avoided him like the pague. never returned his phone calls. said mean things about him to my oh-so-important friends ( whom i never see anymore). i blocked him on my computer. but i did all this because i knew I KNEW that it was all over. i was going to marry him. it scared me. first of all, he was alot older than me ( he was 35 and i was 21 when we met). i wasnt sure what he wanted or if it was going to last. i ddidnt want to gamble it. i had a child from a previous long term relationship that went sour so i was totally leary of anything seeming permenant.anyhoo. after a month or so of avoiding him i gave in ( well actually i got horny lol)so i agreed to see him again.from then on we pretty much saw each other weekly. he gave me a key to his apartment( he worked nights) so on the weekends my son went to go visit his grandparents i would drive an hour and a half to his apartment and spend the night waiting on him to get home. he spoiled me. we had long weekends in chalets, we would go shopping and hed buy me anything i wanted. was so good to me. one night we were driving around and decided it would be fun to get a room at a cheap sleazy motel and scew our brains out. there we were in this place with cinderblock walls and cigarette burns on the sheets, humping like bunnies, and out of nowhere, way out of left field he looks right at me and says : "i love you, you know that right?" well of corse i knew it but it was the first time he said it.we layed there for hours watching an osbornes marathon, and making out, and i know it dosent sound very romantic, but it is such a great memory. my son and i moved in with him a few months later. and after living together for about 4 months we found out i was pregnant with our daughter. we got married in a cheap little chapel.it was great.were pretty happy. he really is the smartest person i know. and being married is so great, hes my best friend and we really are as close as you could possibly be. not to say we dont have our fights,lifes not perfect and sometimes it would be easier to be on my own, but i would really miss him.

        so here it is. everything about me and what im going to ramble aimlessly about in this blog, which no one will probably read but here goes anyhow..... im 23 , married female with 2 children, Liam who is almost 4 years, and Ella-Blue who is almost 7 months now. untill recently i was a stay -at -home mom, but have returned to my career in pharmacology. sounds totally exciting i know but such is life. my husband, scott, and i have been married for a little over a year, and have been together for over 2 years now.i guess the reason im talking out in the open this way instead of keeping a diary is that i really have no friends ( where we live, way up in the country,  far far away from where i grew up), and sometimes i just have random thoughts and no one to share them with.i like to write short stories, poems, haikus and stuff. i love punk music ( not pop punk, the good shit) but im a total girly girl, i love shopping and makeup and shoes and all that, but still im not a total airhead.lol. i read alot, watch quirky movies, my husband works nights so i dont really sleep much, so there will prolly be veery looooong boring posts on here with me talking about stupid  things like how i wish we had cable so i could just put my brain on auto pilot for a few hours and get some sleep....... to be continued tomorrow night........
