      I truly believe this. I am horrifed, awestruck, and inspired by its power. Technology is such a tricky business. I remember the changeover from cassette tapes to CDs. I remember being, like, 11 and thinking, "Nice, the world is definitely getting way better". I listened to Amy Grant on repeat. I could listen to the same song over and over, all night, and never get out of bed. Then when I was about 15, the Internet appeared. It was so sketchy then, people. So new. My dad got AOL and my end began. I stayed up marathon hours IMing strange men and being sketchy and anonymous. The anonymity was what was so empowering. I met a nice boy, Matt, from Michigan. Our friendship started innocently enough--we had a common interest in the Dave Matthews Band. Then one night I was feeling frisky and dropped the Peter North bomb. From then on it was "cybersex", which is so fucking weird anyway, and even elaborate schemes to have PHONE SEX (I was 16! This was the mid-90s! My dad was sleeping upstairs---AGGGHHHHH!!!). I am an "adventurous" girl. These internet trysts were a part of growing up for me. A new puberty. Puberty for the millenium, if you will. Imagine if the first time you got yourself off you were perched in front of your computer, rubbing away to 10-second free porn clips! (I actually think my boyfriend, six years my junior, probably started this way--which is wicked fucking scary, too!) I did it the old-fashioned way! I found my brother's magazines and shoved them into a drawer when I heard a car pull in the driveway. But now, technology is moving faster than our skimpy human shells can handle (in my opinion). Will my children call upon digital prostitutes for lap dances at 10, 11 years old??? They grow up so fast...

      Somehow this makes sense. What a freakin' week. So much bad and so much good. For the bad, my beloved supervisor was laid off from the company. This is disgusting for so many reasons. For the good, I got me a new job and I will be "outta heah" in less than two weeks. How do you spell relief??? R-E-S-I-G-N-A-T-I-O-N. Yes, I will be handing in my letter of resignation either today or tomorrow, and will be beginning a hopefully long and successful career molding the minds of this country's fine youths.  Exactly two weeks til Evan is home. Can I get a "praise Jesus"? Amen.  Alyssa's bachelorette party is this weekend. I feel as though there will be penises dangling from every possible danglifiable surface. And lots of booze. And raunch. ; )  On that note, I will publicly vent, for my own therapeutic purposes, about the fact that I do not like to "go out". I am a busy girl. I work twelve hours days most of the week, and when that's done, I come home and there's more stuff for me to do--eat dinner, pay bills, write emails, spend time with my cat, make lists, set out my clothing for the next day, etc. Now forgive me if I sound like a 40-year-old woman. I actually believe that I  AM  a forty year old woman and have been since the day I popped out.  I don't like to go out . Occasionally I think it's fun. Of course getting hammered and crude for my best friend's bach. party is awesome. But I am just tired of being treated like an alien (by no one in particular) because I would rather read or hang out by myself when I get home from work. I am  NOT  an alien. I am just forty. I think I shall make myself a t-shirt. "It's not you; I'm just forty" is what it shall say. Maybe then I could escape the guilt I feel when I turn down offers to have these crazy good times. I have found two other 20-somethings who are actually forty. We will be beginning an alliance. Leave me a message if you would like to join.  Off to buy arthritis cream...

      Ruff! I am such a bad little blogstress, aren't I? I don't know what I should say here today. I'm about to eat lunch and am thrilled to death about it.  This weekend will be a wonderful reunion of all my best friends from high school. Alyssa is marrying Chris (a man whose GIVEN name has absolutely nothing to do with the word Chris). There will be showers, parties, presents, food, love, lots of joy, and, hopefully, some bawdy, raucous lewdness; I can't f-ing wait.  In other news, I'm trying to get laid off so I can get a new damn job. I've got an interview on Tuesday at a SCHOOL, dear Lord yes, and am muy pumped.  Also. Read East of Eden. Don't just sit there. Do it. Ridic. Steinbeck, where are you? Come be my sugar daddy. Can I sit on your lap and take drags of your cigarette and bask in your simple wisdom and be your sugar baby? Let's do it all in California. John, if you're out there, I'm waiting.  My boyfriend has been gone since May 15.  He finally comes back to me in three weeks. In the words of the great Jean Val Jean, Bring that motherfucker home.  It is the most beautiful day today. It's one of those summer/fall cuspers that tickles my insides and makes me feel equal parts invincible, beautiful, whole, and melancholy. Oh my God. In the words of the great Jean Val Jean, Fuckin-A; fall.  I think it's time for me to write that book I've been talking about since I could pick up a pencil. In fifth grade my ambitions in the middle school yearbook were to be an author and a housewife. How was I so brilliant even at 10 years old? (I paid for it by becoming a sumo wrestler for a span of 5 years after that).  Never make a deal with the devil.
