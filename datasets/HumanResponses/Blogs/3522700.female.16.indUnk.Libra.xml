      went cineleisure to do project work today. yeah... u may wonder what a place for project work. but i thot the ambience of the cafe was quite good. jiaying agrees too. but i think the boys dun. anyway, true enuff, our whole group juz stone there. seems like our group is known to be the stoner group in class. we stoned for like 15mins b4 we finally start talking. but really, there isnt much talking. much of the time, there's pauses and silence. but i think we'll manage to scrape thru in the end. after the meeting, jiaying n i decided to visit the library to do more research. luckily, we found some really useful materials. den i also made a reservation on the book  can you keep a secret  by  sohpie kinsella .i really love the author. though i dun read often. ive only read one of her books, 'shopaholic ties the knot' and i think it's really one of the best books ive read so far.  anyway, its already so late at nite and early in the morning. 1.41am now. damn. n i have not managed to finish my revision on literature. im going to  WILD WILD WET  later with xiaoyun and meiling. have to wake up at 7.30!! damn....ml la....insist on going there early. haha.... so i have like five hrs to sleep! damn.... n i wanna start on my lit revision now cuz i m kinda energetic now.  (weird...)  but wateva.....i think the waters will prevent me from dozing off tml.

      project work really sucks. the tiger beer head of advertising is pushing her job to someone else n now, it seems tat our project is getting nowhere. this is really scary, to think tat it's gonna be counted in our A level results.  anyway, clarence called yesterday and told me he has started studying for exams. this really freak me out.  clarence chew  has started studying for exams but i have not. im so dead. ok...maybe i have started a teeny weeny bit on GP but i guess it's still not enuff. since  clarence  has started studying, i guess the rest of the ppl have started mugging weeks ago. but im really tired. everytime i wanna sit down n study, i feel like sleeping again. and i finally have an excuse for sleeping in class next time: i went to the doc tat day n he said tat i have low blood pressure. so it means tat i feel tired easily and too much exercise can actually make me faint. =S. didnt know im  tat  weak. anyway, i think i shall start studying today. if possible.  to clarence : congrats on winning the bball match. yeah, n u scored the  most  pts. so proud of u. hahaha...

      went to tj dance nite with xiaoyun yesterday. finally got to see her, so happy! xy didnt change much, still so cute and sporty. =) anyway, the dance nite was quite spectacular. there's this break dance and seriously, those dancers were much better than the break dancers from vj music fest. i only know two dancers there, sookching and  shella . shella can really dance well! ( durrrr ) actually, i didnt know she can dance hip hop so well. you go, girl! as for sook, not bad also. she likes to smile alot, tat's wat i know. saw boon keng her bf there too. come to think abt it, they've been together for quite some time.  anyway, rj dance club performed too. wat the hell.. all the girls were wearing adidas stuff from head to toe. show off! den i remembered how marianne and i actually tried to do the rj slang in front of rj tat time. haha. oh..den i saw  pengyu  also. haha. it was quite awkward for me to wave to him. all bcuz of charmaine! haha. go tell him i said he looks like mark lee. i saw alot of ppl i know at the dance nite. think i saw jan siau too. haha... but she looks slimmer, so i dunno whether i got the right one. anyway, xiaoyun really got loud frens huh? haha...  daphne  and  khim rong  and  olivia . haha.. it's been like, few yrs since i last saw khim rong. she kept asking me whether she has grown fatter. haha... hard question. as for daphne, she's really cool. she looks pretty. but i guess she'll prefer ppl to say she's  handsome . =)  gotta rush for my hist essay now. tata!

      we should have won. we could have won. but we lost. yeah, the  inter-ct captain's ball tournament . cant believe that we actually got kicked out at the second round. we were winning in the first half but perhaps the opponents were too strong or their cheerleaders were simply too loud.&nbsp;our class&nbsp;did not have any supporters at all. still, we should have won. but we lost. still, you guys were terrific:   fariza, marianne, clarence, max, zav, jianyong .  we are such a great team. haha.  the taiwanese student is coming tml. cant wait for it. juz know her name but dunno how she looks like. she's called  xiao ning . sounds so demure. im not sure where to bring her these two weeks. seems like they've already toured orchard almost every night this week so now, i dunno where to bring&nbsp;her to shop. but char said we'll take her to take neoprints! haha. char n her can take all they want. i hate taking neoprints. talking abt char. i really do stupid things whenever im with her la (and she still said it's she always do stupid things whenever she's with me). anyway, the vj snack machine is a horror. we thot the opening was only a small gap and couldnt pull out the cup of instant noodle. so in the end, we tried pulling n squeezing the cup of noodle out of the snack machine for 15 minutes! everyone ard us was looking at us. den i realised that the opening could actually be pushed further and both of us started laughing like mad women. few ppl ard us were laughing hysterically as well. -_- haha. den before that, jun wei, char n i were talking at the stone table. and char n i were talking abt my 'f maths' again. n she didnt tell me junwei was from dhs also! juz hope junwei doesnt tell 'f maths' abt it. =) see? i always make a fool of myself whenever im with charmaine. hahaha... but you're still so sweet la. tried to cheer me up after the game today. really appreciated that! lurve ya!  today's already friday and max still hasnt get big-head girl's number. loser la u. hahaha.... max broke my heart man. he kept saying that 'f maths' is damn ugly.  damn ugly.  how can it be! i think he's  damn cool  la. even krys agrees with me rite? haha.

      life's quite stressful now. especially after getting back the result slip. yeah, though i didnt fail any subject, i still think i did really badly. dunno how to break the news to my mother. i really wanna concentrate n study but i juz feel damn tired n not movitated. promos is juz&nbsp;9 more weeks away, can u ever imagine tat? damn... n im gonna waste two full weeks to entertain the taiwanese student. n tat leaves me with like 7 weeks. horror of horrors! maybe i shld drop a subject. i have been thinking of dropping history since im really not into this subject at all. i&nbsp;know it is interesting to understand n stuff but to study for it makes me puke. i cant see myself memorising every single event in the pages of history. tat's juz so ridiculous. i wanna drop lit too but i noe i shldnt give up on lit easily since ive pulled thru it for Os. man.....why am i even thinking abt dropping subjects? whatever it is, all rite......i shall tell myself this: im gonna work hard in two week's time, after the taiwanese student leave. im gonna mug all day n all nite, regardless of how tired i am. but i need someone or something to motivate me. hmmm...i think ive found it. yup. cheer for me, guys!

      today was college day. man....that was one boring ceremony. since the performing theatre cld only contain 800 ppl, the rest of the sch was assigned to stay in other lect theatres to watch the ceremony. everyone was not really paying attention...chattting and playing cards on their own. after that, went parkway with charmaine. we laughed alot on stupid things, like 'yours' and 'mine' hehe... she was telling me abt jaron. that he always skip sch but still so clever. takes two S papers...my god! one of them was phy somemore. smart guy. suddenly, im so inspired to be like him. haha. going my grandma's bdae party tml. have not seen my relatives for quite some time. but i think it's gonna be kinda boring. since the ppl going to the party is dwindling each yr. the adults juz seemed to have sth on n will not go. how unfilial. luckily, my whole family will be going.  anyway, lots of hw to do! wanna finish them by tonite. dunno can or not. let's see. i shall do econs drq...den i'll do chinese compo. den if i have time i shall attempt to do the vectors assignment, though i still have no clue wat vectors is abt.

      Vj had  half day off  today cuz we’ve been winning quite a lot of titles n awards recently. So went back to zhss with daryl and aaron to collect the leaving cert. The school didn’t change much, still as lifeless and dull. So I dun really miss the environment, it’s the ppl tat I miss. Anyway, the first teacher we saw was   mr lim yong khern  . He’s still as charming and handsome as ever. Really melts my heart. Haha… as usual, he was scolding this boy n making him run round the parade square. He was like, ‘harlow!’ to us and then turned ard and shouted at the boy. -_- contrast. We didn’t get to see other teachers cuz apparently, they’re having some conferencing.  Anyway, aaron is leaving for Australia soon. Cant believe it. Two of my closest guy frens are leaving spore. =(&nbsp; feel very sad for cindy also. But im sure they’ll be able to keep up with the long distance relationship. Asked aaron why does he have to go but his reasons are kinda vague. Dunno what he talking abt also. But I’ll wish him all the best. Oh yeah, charmaine is  so  sweet. she asked me out tml cuz she knows I went shopping alone today. Haha. But seriously, I really like to shop alone… I think it’s rather fun. After some time, I realized im not tat monophobic anymore. =)

        BEAUTIFUL ICE PRINCESS/PRINCE .You need distance between you and your partner in your relationship. You are very difficult to get. You have big requirements and this one you love must try hard to get you. But after she/he melt your heart she/he will be the most happy person in the world. You need someone who shoes you that you are special&nbsp; and it makes you feel good to see that you are loved. She/He shall know that you could easily get another girl/boyfriend but you wont&nbsp; as long as you love him.&nbsp; when she/he hurts you you will hurt him too, but in general you dont get hurt. If your partner cheated you ,you would react cold and immediately (try to) forget&nbsp;him  urlLink  &nbsp;~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

WON BIN ROCKS!!!    he's so damn freaking handsome in the show, even with blood smeared all over his face n body. luckily, he didnt die in the end, unlike wat krys told me. haha. but his brother died. so sad.... anyway, after learning abt the korean war during hist, seems like ive got a better understanding of the movie and why his bro became a communist in the end. hmm... at least find some good uses of studying hist. and once again..... WON BIN ROCKS!!!!  i'll give the movie four popcorns!  &nbsp;

      Tired of this barrier between -us- Sinister clouds litter above, with no one to clear the sky. We're treading on a no man's land: Any attempt to cross it meant death. We're dead, dead in the heart and soul, for the hurt has erased our happiness and we-  Wait, since when is there happiness?  Please, allow me to close my eyes. All these pains and sufferings have induced me to sleep. An endless walk with no light, no one to guide me through. An endless fight against no one, winning nothing. Perhaps, it shall end soon.  In the end, i will still lie A l o n e .
