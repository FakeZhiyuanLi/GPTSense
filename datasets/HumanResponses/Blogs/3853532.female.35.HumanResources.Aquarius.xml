      I want to be one of those old hippies who wears mumus because they're comfortable and wears her hair long even though it's gone grey.  Is it weird that I'm looking forward to aging? I mean, I'm not looking forward to aches and pains, and I'm not hoping to rush the process or anything. But it seems like I will feel less pressure to be "pretty" when I'm old.   I know that a lot of women feel it's the opposite: that it's easy to be young and hard to age (and if I worked in Hollywood--where a career can be ruined by the natural aging process--I might agree). But I think it's terribly difficult to be young and not fit cultural standards, physically speaking. People look at you more when you're young. It's when you're supposed to be finding a mate and orchestrating your fairy tale ending. A task that poor self esteem makes quite dicey, I must add.  When you're old, all that stuff is--supposedly--over and done. Decided. There's no pressure.  Maybe I'm just delusional. It's easy to pontificate this way from 24 years old. I might feel differently when I'm 60.

      I hate to diet. I absolutely  abhor  it.  It seems like I am always setting myself up for failure. I set goals--sometimes tiny, sometimes enormous and unrealistic--and when I fall short, I feel guilty.  Guilt and dieting, for me, go hand in hand.  I think I have built up a resentment to the entire concept of dieting  because  of the guilt I feel when I break the regimen.   It's a bit silly really, because I have had self-imposed dietary restrictions for as long as I can remember. I limit my dairy intake (because of lactose intolerance, and also, dairy isn't that good for you!), I don't eat red meat or pork, and I limit my carbohydrate intake (despite constantly craving carbs). This is just something I do, but if I called it a diet, I'd eat half a cow and a tub of ice cream tomorrow, just in spite of myself.  I wonder why?

      Here's the deal: I have never been supermodel material.  I look at women who spend their days on the catwalks and my mind boggles. No amount of proper eating, exercise or metabolism-enhancing pills will ever give me their physique. And being so bombared with adverts and images telling me I'm TOO FAT and I need to LOSE WEIGHT FAST puts me into sensory overload.  I can't be all bad, because I've had boyfriends, and people tell me I'm pretty quite frequently. But I don't feel attractive, and I haven't for as long as I can remember. I have never been, in my estimation, a pretty girl.  But why the fuck am I so hard on myself? Why are we all so hard on ourselves? When did life become a constant obsession with dieting, instead of something to be lived and loved and  enjoyed ? When did Atkins become more important than God?   I recently met a man on the Internet, and he's really wonderful. I'm so enjoying getting to know him that we're slated to meet in person in early Autumn. Already I'm worrying--will I compare to other women he's been with? Will he be disappointed? Mind you I went through all of these worries with my ex boyfriends, and it was all for naught. They still took me to bed (where I work magic, because nothing makes me feel better about myself than pleasing my mate), and in some cases, took me into their hearts.  I decided to start this blog because I'm tired of being holed up in this prison of poor self-image, which in turn just fuels the fire of depression (which seems to come and go cyclically). I've asked some friends to come on board and join the "Strangely Shaped Girl" team to post their thoughts too, so that together we can all start to reform our bodies, minds, and spirits, one post at a time.

      I've been thinking a lot about relationships lately. Specifically, I've been thinking about what I bring to the table, and why I have a hard time selling myself to potential partners.  I've been blessed to have some really meaningful relationships in my short life. And I think they've bene formative, too. I've learned a lot about how I behave in a partnership with another human being. All in all, I think I make a pretty good S/O.  I am kind and caring. I am compassionate. I am generous. I am passionate. I am faithful. I am honest. I am supportive. I'm a very good lover (and honestly, I probably wouldn't be if I were catwalk material and all I had to bring to the bed were my looks). I'm attentive. I listen well. I give good feedback. I love to experiment. I am adventurous when able so to be. I am open-minded. I am willing to compromise. I appreciate little things. I like to rise to a challenge.  So if I bring all of those qualities (and more) with me to a relationship, a sort of personality dowry, why has it always been so hard for me to be confident about seeking and securing a partner? I read through personals adverts and a lot of men are looking for the sort of things I have to offer.   I am getting better, though. A little bit every day. I can't take all the credit for my development, though. I have friends who do a great job at boosting my ego!

       A Palm Beach Post writer, making the point that America's obesity problem is not limited to humans, reported from the Boca Greens Animal Hospital (Boca Raton, Fla.) in June that "Pumpkin," a 12-pound Chihuahua, was up and moving well after her recent liposuction surgery. However, the 12 ounces of fat she lost still left her among South Florida's overweight pets, said to be two-thirds of their population. As Pumpkin's owner was reminded, surgery is not to be a substitute for sensible exercise and a modest number of treats. [Palm Beach Post, 6-22-04]   urlLink Click Here for More   What the heck? Honestly, it's not bad enough they're doing liposuction in the stupidest places on people now, but dogs? DOGS?

      Self-esteem, for me, seems to come and go. Almost as cyclically as depression (which, mercifully, I haven't suffered from in quite some time).  Sometimes my self-confidence shifts multiple times in a day. It depends what I'm doing, who I'm with...if I am working on something and accomplishing a lot, I feel very self-confident and proud. Somehow that all spills over to my body image and I feel better about myself. Probably more realistically about myself--because I am my own worst critic.  If I am with someone romantically I can easily feel good about myself, if not great about myself. Love is quite a tonic. There was a bit on  Xena  earlier on in the show's life, wherein Xena tells Gabrielle (paraphrase) that she can only believe in herself when someone else believes in her, first. Written out like this it sounds rather sad, but I can relate to that. Having someone fancy me makes me feel like maybe I'm decent human being material after all.

      Many people tell me that one symptom of depression is a lack of libido. For it, it's always been the exact opposite. When I'm very depressed, I am hypersexual, because giving another person pleasure makes me feel good about myself. I get a sort of high from it, not unlike being buzzed on drugs or alcohol.  As a general matter of course I'm a sexual/sensual being. I love sex and I love making a man feel good. Even when I'm not depressed, nothing makes me feel sexier than to watch a man's face when I'm doing something naughty to him.   But sex, to me, is only good when it's with someone I care about. I can't derive the same boost of self-confidence from attempting to please someone I know nothing about. It just feels hollow and lacking in any substance.  When I am not depressed, sex becomes almost a holy act, for me. I can escape into a "sexual trance" where the only thing that matters is what I'm doing and what's being done to me, focusing entirely on the union of my lover's body with mine. Being in that moment, sharing something so personal...it really is the stuff of dreams.  I haven't been in a deep depression in a long time, and I am making so many positive changes in my life, I don't think I'll be sliding down that slope again anytime soon. Hopefully, if I ever do, I'll be in a relationship with someone who can recognise the depressive tendencies in me and help me to nip it in the bud (either by himself or by encouraging me to seek therapy) before it gets out of hand.  Meanwhile, as I continue to make positive changes and sound steps forward, I am finding my self-confidence creeping towards a better place. The support of loved ones helps immeasurably, but at the end of the day, I've had to be responsible for my own happiness--or misery--and now that I am starting to attain some joy, I'm working even harder at doing what must be done to hold on to it.

         Here is a picture of me at my thinnest. I was 15, 4'11", and 115#. You really can't see it in that picture, but that sweater was literally just hanging off of me in bags, as were my jeans. This is what I'm  supposed  to look like according to all of those wonderful-happy charts. Gag me with a spoon. (can you see the circles under my eyes?)

      So I was tooling around on MSNBC.com's Health news section the other day and came across this little bit of news:  ""Anyone with a body mass index (a ratio between your height and weight) of 25 or above - that’s someone, for example, who is 5-foot-4 and 145 pounds - is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. Anyone with a body mass index of 30 or above - such as someone who is 5-foot-6 and 186 pounds - is considered obese.""  Isn't that happy news??  Honestly, I sat here and cried. It made me think of me waaaaay back when I was a teenager (20 years ago). An anorexic teenager. I was anorexic because I never felt like I was good enough. I was always too fat, too short, too stupid, too something, too anything, too nothing.  I feel bad enough about weighing 220# as it is, although I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm that heavy - people look at me and can't believe I'm that heavy; I must "carry it well" or something. But then I read articles like the one I quoted,and I end up feeling completely devestated. According to all the so-called "health charts" someone my height is supposed to way somewhere in the vacinity of 110-120#. At the height of my anorexia years, I weighed 115#. I looked awful. I looked like I had one foot in the grave. And I was *not* healthy. My freshman year of college, my swim teacher/coach did that body fat thing they do with callipers, and I came up with *negative* body fat; there wasn't anything on me to pinch!  Reading this made me think of Dina's post about self-image. The American woman is bombarded almost constantly with images and sound-bites about diet and appearance, or at least it seems that way. Ultra-thin women on magazine covers, in advertisements. Advertisements for weightloss supplements and diets, 99% of which never work.  I honestly think that the biggest reason I've had trouble losing weight, aside from not getting more exercise, is that somewhere in the back of my head, I'm terrified of becoming anorexic again. I admitted that to myself a couple of years ago and erroneously thought, "HA! I admitted it, now maybe I can lose weight!" Nope. I've gained 15# since then. And lost it. And gained it back. And lost it. And ... well, you see ... :sigh: Too, I've heard quite often since Tayler was born 13 years ago that women who have c-sections have a hell of a time losing weight, especially when they're given a vertical cut like I was. Maybe I've stuck that into the back of my head and my subconscious hangs on to that for some reason.  I have no idea.  I do know that at one point I lost 75#. I'm not sure how. I do know, though, that 40# of it came right back.  I don't know what it is. I don't overeat; in fact, if anything, I don't eat as much as I should. I eat an apple with every meal. I drink almost two gallons of water every day. I don't drink soda anymore. I pay attention to what snackfoods I eat - I don't eat very many of those anymore, and I make sure I don't eat more than the given "serving size" listed on the nutrition panel (sometimes I don't even eat that much). I don't eat a lot of candy, but what candy I do eat is the new kinds which are sweetened with Splenda. I've cut my caffeine consumption down by 95% - something I thought I'd never do nor ever be able to do. I stopped smoking this time last year; I don't even crave cigarettes. I do Yoga every day, and I bellydance like a maniac once a week. I'm supposed to take a walk every morning, but I refuse to do so during the summer while it's 90* out; with the climate where I live, that's a good way to kill yourself, and I *did* give up being suicidal a long time ago. :sigh:  At this point, I honestly don't know what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong. I had a long talk with both of my doctors - once in April and once in June - and they both agree that I *look* good, that losing weight shouldn't be my focus, that being healthy should be. Honestly, right now, my only huge concerns are my blood pressure and my on-going, continuing problems with panic disorder; and truly, everybody seems to agree that my blood pressure problems are largely due to stress issues. (which sets off my anxiety problems ....)  Anyway. I'm glad this blog is here just for this, and that we're here to help and support each other. That means a lot.

      In 3 weeks I'll be leaving for Paris. Tanning, primping & preening, getting myself into some sort of shape (whatever shape it may be, remains to be seen). Three weeks! Cannot possibly be coming that quickly...can it?  I can't help but think back to the AbFab season 4 episode where Edina decides to go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. (Though that's hardly what I've been doing for the past few months, there's very little "crash" about it...) Quote: "In three weeks I want to be on the cusp of organ failure."  Good old Eddie.

      The "BodyFlex" exercise routine marketers just plain got greedy. And it's a shame, too, because they have a product that I think genuinely works.  When I bought the BodyFlex videos & isometrics bar a long while ago, they weren't making any outrageous claims. They were simply telling the facts: increased oxygen into your body is good! Add resistance for muscle building and you'll have a sure-fire way to fight flab. I had been practicing pranayama for some time, and it seemed like a natural thing to combine both structured breathing and physical exercise. Plus, isometrics just feels  soooooooooo good . (As does deep breathing!)  I was immediately thrilled with the BodyFlex program and loved the isometric "gym bar". It's a little wonder. And I liked the sensbility of it all--no hype, no pressure, just a lot of positive reinforcement and good vibes. Greer Childers, the spokeswoman, has a very gentle way about her. Her little words of encouragement are quite nice, despite the fact that she looks  exactly  like Barbie, right down to the unnatural proportions. She's still huffing and puffing away whilst doing the exercises with you and that's kinda neat.  Plus, you do the entire routine sitting in a chair, but at the end your heart is pumping, you're feeling the burn, and you're definitely aerobic--no doubts about it. It's cardio in its own oxygenated way.   Then the marketers decided to try the tactic of "lose 7-14 inches in 7 days without dieting", which is ludicrous. Of course, the FTC sued. I don't think the BodyFlex program is still being produced, which is a pity. If they hadn't tried the gimmick, they'd still be selling the product--and at not an inconsiderable profit (but people would be feeling good about it instead of feeling cheated).  FWIW, I did not lose 7-14 inches in 7 days, but I did lose a combined total of 25 inches (from all measured points) in the first month, just doing BodyFlex by itself. I still do the routine and still like it very much. It, alone, is not enough to cause substantial weight loss, despite my initial dramatic results (they were not sustainable). It takes proper nutrition & diet, lots of water, and I find that if I do yoga after the BodyFlex routine the results are much more permanent. It's always a combination of things.  Nowadays it's hard to weed out the genuine treasures from the hyped-up junk. Every company seems to be trying to one-up the competition with increasingly incredulous claims. The FTC must have several full-time employees doing nothing but sueing fitness companies. But I consider "BodyFlex" to be a gem. YMMV, of course, because exercise is nothing if not utterly subjective!  I do not think I would have purchased "BodyFlex" had the claim of 7-14 inches in the first week been front and centre when I bought it. I don't recall that phrase being bandied about on the web site or infomercial. I wonder when the parent company decided to jump on the hype bandwagon? At any rate, there is no magic bullet for weight loss, and every time we try a gimmick & fail, we just run the risk of feeling worse about ourselves ("why does this work for them, but not for me?").   I try to steer clear of any product that raises the "too good to be true" red flags. But if you like breathing exercises and you like stretching & resistance training, look for a BodyFlex kit on eBay. You'll want the instructional videos and the "gym bar" (sometimes referred to as "BodyFlex Plus"). Just don't expect to lose 7-14 inches in 7 days--I'm not sure that's possible unless you're dead!
