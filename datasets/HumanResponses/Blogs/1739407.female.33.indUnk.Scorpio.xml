      If you have visited my blog before you've probably seen the name acronym link.  I decided to look up all the words for CmdrSue to see how well I thought it fit me.    Cheesy   1. Containing or resembling cheese.  2. Of poor quality; shoddy.  I always thought of cheesy as also meaning sort of goofy, but perhaps this was because I grew up with Chester Cheetah around.  If you agree that it means goofy then I will say that I do in fact contain or resemble cheese.   Mystical   1. Of or having a spiritual reality or import not apparent to the intelligence or senses.  2. Of, relating to, or stemming from direct communion with ultimate reality or God: a mystical religion.  3. Enigmatic; obscure: mystical theories about the securities market.  4. Of or relating to mystic rites or practices.  5. Unintelligible; cryptic.   Oh yes.  Absolutely.   Devious   1. Not straightforward; shifty: a devious character.  2. Departing from the correct or accepted way; erring: achieved success by devious means.  3. Deviating from the straight or direct course; roundabout: a devious route.  4. Away from a main road or course; distant or removed.   I didn't react well to this one the first time I saw it, but I do often say that I'm clever.  I don't use a direct attack on anything unless it is absolutely necessary.  Does that mean that I'm devious?  I don't like the connotations of the word, but if we go with definitions 3 or 4 I have to say it is pretty much true.   Relaxing   1. To make lax or loose.  2. To make less severe or strict.  3. To reduce in intensity; slacken.  4. To relieve from tension or strain.   From what I understand, I give good vibe.  Sometimes people just like to have me around because I calm them.  I don't understand quite how this works, just that it is something that happens.   Sultry   1. Very humid and hot.  2. Extremely hot; torrid.  3. Expressing or arousing desire.  "The night was sultry..."  Every Scorpio wants to think that this is true of them.  Is it?  How in the heck would I know?  In the eye of the beholder, baby.   Unusual   1. Not usual, common, or ordinary.  Well, ain't that the truth.  Why be normal?  What is normal, anyway?  When I was younger I took normal as the most dire insult you could give me.   Exhausting   1. To wear out completely. 2. To drain of resources or properties; deplete.  3. To use up completely.  4. To treat completely.  5. To draw out the contents of; drain.  6. To let out or draw off.  How could I be both relaxing and exhausting?  I dunno.  But I think that I am.  When "on task" I can be tenacious and energetic.  Very, very, very tenacious.  So that's it.  I think yeah, I own my acronym.  It's pretty much me.  And if this post wasn't cheesy, I don't know what is...

      Now let me tell you a little something that may not be apparent if you're a reader of my blog.  The way that I make my bread and butter (and a little marmalade) is by providing analysis and recommendations to executives.  Sometimes I get hired for different reasons - financial analysis, systems implementation, budget development - since those are all skills that I've developed, but analysis and recommendation is what I always end up  doing .  Why?  Because I'm cautious, analytical, reasoned, visionary, and judicious.  I don't make things up, I look them up.  So when I say that I'm a member of a wild-eyed coalition it should give people some pause.  Being me, of course, I turned to Dictionary.com to give some insight.  Wild-eyed 1.  Glaring in or as if in anger, terror, or madness.  2.  Extreme and passionate in belief or advocacy.  Coalition 1.  An alliance, especially a temporary one, of people, factions, parties, or nations.  2.  A combination into one body; a union.   Bill Clinton once said that the fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans is that "Democrats fall in love.  Republicans fall in line."  What this administration has done, essentially, is make the Democrats act like Republicans.  We are beginning to fall in line.  Why?  Because we're mad - about the lies, the insane spending and debts, and the crippling of important programs like public education.  We're so mad that we are willing to set aside various moderate to extreme liberal agendas to form a passionate alliance, an extreme union, a glaring body, for the sole purpose of setting our political house to rights.  To this administration and the Republicans in the Congress I have to say - You told us that you would be the moral party, the grown up party.  Fool us once, shame on you.  Fool us twice... Go f#*@ yourself.

      These Irish eyes are smiling, because the natives of my ancestral homeland  urlLink protested Bush's visit .    Rallying under the  urlLink "Stop Bush Campaign"  banner, the crowd of about 10,000 waved signs denouncing Bush as a warmonger and calling for an end to American military flights though Shannon Airport, a strategic refueling point used by thousands of U.S. troops each month...  "Good people of America," read one placard, "vote that son of a Bush out."  "If we don't speak out, our silence will be taken as consent," Dublin Mayor Andrew Montague told the crowd. "This president lied to the world about the reasons for invading Iraq."  ...Leaders of Green Party handed out copies of a mock set of instructions advising protesters how to make a "citizen's arrest" of Bush if they meet him.   This reminds me of something Bono from U2 said once.  The difference between an American and an Irishman is that the American sees the rich man on the hill and says, "One day I'm going to be that man."  The Irishman says, "One day I'm going to get that man..."

       CmdrSue tests out as a Chaotic Good Elf Ranger Bard     Alignment:   Chaotic Good  characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.   Race:   Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.   Primary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.   Secondary Class:   Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.

      Robert Reich is on The Daily Show right now with his new book:                           It got me to thinking I've been meaning to look up liberal/liberalism and conservative/conservatism since I think most people are talking from perceptions, not facts.  Ultimately what is important is that the communication is effective but I think it's also good to know the true definitions.    Liberalism:  A political theory founded on the natural goodness of humans and the autonomy of the individual and favoring civil and political liberties, government by law with the consent of the governed, and protection from arbitrary authority.    Conservatism:   A political orientation advocating the preservation of the best in society and opposing radical changes.  This confirms for me that I'm a Conservative Liberal.

      Yesterday's brain fuzziness wasn't just a lack of coffee.  By the afternoon I was running a fever and today I'm home with tea, vitamin C, and the dvd player.  We have more dvds than any rational person would, and now seems a good time to enjoy it.  Right now we're watching  Beverly Hills Cop .  Work is unending so I'm running reports and updating spreadsheets.  Life sucks.  Except for the dvd player.

      I lived in Mississippi (of and on) for about ten years and I can't tell you how many people sidled up to me and asked me if I was Baptist.  This is particularly odd since it started with my 7-year-old classmates.  I found that a blank look worked best.  Engaging any of them in a theological discussion was, well... pointless.    Having been raised with an excess of dogma herself, my Mom wanted us to have the opportunity to think for ourselves.  We didn't go to church, but we did talk about God.  Of the three of us, two turned out very deeply spiritual and the other one I'll call agnostic because he still can't decide where he falls on the whole God issue.  He loves to discuss it deep into the night - calling on physics, metaphysics, history, and large quantities of beer.  Our Mom has decided she is an atheist, but I think that's just her code for Angry With God.  You can imagine that our family in a small town of the Deep South full of Southern Baptists was not a good fit.  Now the Southern Baptist contingent has decided to  urlLink leave the Baptist World Alliance   because "some members of the loose, global association had adopted liberal theology and "anti-American" thinking" .  In the great "Life of Brian" comedy, the Southern Baptists are worshipping Brian's shoe.  That's right, I'm saying that they don't "get it".   "Paige Patterson, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, said the SBC (Southern Baptist Convention) should not give money or endorsement to an organization that includes liberals.  He also complained that the American Baptist Churches, a U.S. denomination, includes "gay-friendly congregations," and that other members of the world alliance call the inerrancy of Scripture into question."   How, exactly, can you read the teachings of Jesus and not conclude that he was a liberal?  And not just any liberal.  He was a do-or-die liberal.  I only have the satisfaction of knowing that Jesus very clearly outlined how to live a good life.

Thoughts aren't really stuck in my head today, they are sort of wandering around like lost prehistoric tribesmen.   Howard Dean is going to be in Washington, DC on July 14th.  I'm trying to decide if I want to go.   I haven't been to the Florida beach or the Bahamas in 10 years.  What the hell?

      Sheila Samples has a great article called  urlLink "Has anybody here seen my old friend God?"  posted over at Smirking Chimp.  I recommend reading the whole thing, but here's a sample:     Is there not one Christian who will dare to point out that, in his foolish crusade to rid the world of evil -- a task that only God can perform -- Bush has murdered more innocent people in the last two years than all terrorists combined?...Is there not even one Christian who misses God and His blessed influence in everything around us -- the poetry of life, the music, the sun-lit laughter inspired by goodness and mercy -- the sheer joy of reaching out to help those in need -- the most vulnerable among us?   She calls the issue "faith-shattering".  Amen, sister.  Amen.

       urlLink Joe Bageant  brought up some information that goes in my 'Thing That Make You Cry' file.    Forty-six percent of the American dead in Iraq came from towns of less than 40,000. Yet these towns make up only 25% of our population. Most of the young soldiers were fleeing economically depressed places, or dead end jobs...These so-called volunteers are part of this nation's de facto draft---economic conscription.   I would like to point out that these towns have some of the lowest populations of youth, too, so I'm sure they have been very hard hit by these losses.  Since I've never lived anywhere small, or any particular place for more than a few years, it is hard for me to imagine how these deaths have affected their communities.  But when I try to imagine it, it hurts.  Joe very quickly falls out of favor with me, though, because he dismisses the American soldier's ability to follow their dreams by using the GI-Bill.  Those kids, like all the rest, need to hear that of COURSE they can achieve their dreams.  The key is determination.  And it's hard to keep your chin up when smirking know-it-all writers say,  "I suppose lots of poor kids do go to college on their military benefits. But personally speaking, I can count the number I know who actually did it on one hand. Let's be honest here: graduating from a small town redneck white high school not knowing where Alaska is on a map of the US is not exactly the path to the fountain at Harvard Yard."   Thanks for the stats, Joe, but shame on you for dismissing ANYONE's ambition to improve themselves.  Shame, shame, shame.  Seeds can only grow with proper nurturance, and you aren't helping.

      After our dinner celebrating  urlLink The Mighty Duo of Wonderfulness' results  in the  Urban Challenge, our gang walked over to the the theater to take in  urlLink "Super Size Me" .  I had seen  urlLink Morgan Spurlock  on The Daily Show a few nights before and thought that he was a lot of fun.  And, of course, I had heard a lot of the "buzz" about the film.  Especially since Nevsky had been buzzing from two cubes away for over a month now.  But I really hadn't expected to like the film so damn much.  It was both funny and informative.  And, if you know me, that's sort of like saying it was both great and wonderful.  As an indication of what a datahead I am, when they mentioned the increase in American's eating out I was hopping up and down in my seat whispering to my husband, "That's all tracked by the USDA.  I have the report and graphs at home!  Why aren't they talking about the change in food sold in grocery stores?"  Yes, I wanted them to whip the graphs up on the screen and talk about how even our home cooked food has changed to processed 'easy' stuff.  The information that he presents will definitely make you think twice about the next thing you eat.  I was raised on health food but have  M A J O R L Y  slid into a bad modern American diet.  Three out of three smiley faces for "Super Size Me"!

      It's the poem that got a teacher fired... and blacklisted.  It sent (parts of) the school into a furor.  She was called 'UnAmerican'.  They want her mother to find the poem and destroy it.    How can she be UnAmerican, when protection of  urlLink Freedom of Speech  is fundamental to our way of life?  It's called the  urlLink Bill of Rights , not the  urlLink Bill of No Rights .  Anway, I leave it to the young lady:     urlLink REVOLUTION X   Bush said no child would be left behind  And yet kids from inner-city schools  Work on Central Avenue  Jingling cans that read  Please sir, may I have some more?  They hand out diplomas like toilet paper  And lower school standards  Because  Underpaid, unrespected teachers  Are afraid of losing their jobs  Funded by the standardized tests  That shows our competency  When I'm in detox.  This is the Land of the Free ...  Where the statute of limitations for rape is only five damn years!  And immigrants can't run for President.  Where Muslims are hunted because  Some suicidal men decided they didn't like  Our arrogant bid for modern imperialism.  This is the Land of the Free ...  You drive by a car whose  Bumper screams  God bless America!  Well, you can scratch out the B  And make it Godless  Because God left this country a long time ago.  The founding fathers made this nation  On a dream and now  Freedom of Speech  Lets Nazis burn crosses, but  Calls police to  Gay pride parades.  We somehow  Can afford war with Iraq  But we can't afford to pay the teachers  Who educate the young who hold the guns  Against the "Axis of Evil"  Land of the Free ...  This is the land  If you're politically assertive  They call you a traitor and  Damn you to ostracism.  Say good-bye to Johnny Walker Lindh  And his family.  Bye Bye  American Pie.  So maybe  My ideas about this nation  Don't resolve around perfection  But at least I know  Education is more important  Than money.  Land of the Free . . .  If this was utopia  We'd have to see each other naked  Before we got married  But instead, we see each other naked all the time  Because the government has my social security number  And the name of my dog!  And then we make babies,  But don't worry, they won't be left behind  And they grow up saying  God bless America!  But they don't know who Bush is  Because they never learned the Presidents.  And they will ride the ship Amistad  To our dreamland shores  Bearing the same shackles as us.  I'm here to say that  Generation X  Is pissed and we are taking over,  Ripping down the American illusion of perfection  We are the future generation  I have my qualifications  I know it looks like Angel Soft paper,  But don't worry  It's a diploma  Do I look qualified?  You can take our toilet paper,  But you can't take our Revolution.

      Allen Snyder's  urlLink Deadly Sinful Bush is No Christian  is a great read.  As a teacher of philosophy and ethics, he is understandably upset that Bush presents himself as 'a good Christian'.  I have to say, though, that it's quite often the 'good Christians' that scare me.  I would rather deal with a militant agnostic (I don't know and you don't either!), a questing new-ager (we are all God...), or perhaps a raging Tasmanian Devil.

      I just got a link that speaks straight to my heart from  urlLink An Old Soul , a diatribe on American education from  urlLink The Vast Dairy State Conspiracy .  In her post "Testing Everything, Achieving Nothing" Stacie questions the validity of testing for judging teaching or public education.  Why?  Because the well-fed, library at home, parents read to them, curious, natural test-takers make their teachers/schools look good while the students whose lives are at the other end of the spectrum make their teachers/schools look bad.  That's sort of like planting two cacti - one in the desert and one in a swamp, and then denigrating the one in the swamp because it isn't growing well.  This brings into question - are the issues with American education an educational system issue?  Or a social issue?  One reason that is so close to my heart is that I was bored OUT OF MY MIND in public school.  I was the youngest in the family by seven years - a family that prized intelligence.  Like Stacie, I can't remember a time when I couldn't read.  By third grade I was dragging my brother's geometry book around, proclaiming that I could teach myself geometry faster than they would ever teach it to me in school.  My mother tried to get them to skip me at least a grade ahead but apparently southern Mississippi was too provincial for that.  By seventh grade I convinced my parents to send me to a private school.  The first one, Coast Episcopal, was pretty good.  At least I got to learn some Latin.  Then I moved to Alabama and started eighth grade at St. Paul's Episcopal.  Mid-year my educational pursuits came to a screeching halt with the following conversation in Chemistry class(me in italics):    "I thought we were supposed to memorize the whole table of elements."  "No, just the first ten.  We'll do more later."  "Why didn't you just assign them all at once? I memorized them all over the weekend."  "Susan, we have to teach to the lowest common denominator."   Really,  I thought.   My father is paying through the nose so that you can teach me to the lowest common denominator?   If I'd been in public school I wouldn't have had that last thought.  But I had already given up on public schools (at least the ones I was near) giving me the academic challenge that I needed.  Now I had to give up private schools.  When I mentioned to my mother recently that most people can't understand how my parents could let me quit school so young (13) she said wearily, "They didn't know you, honey.  They just didn't know you..."  Obviously just remembering the curious, headstrong girl that I was made her tired.  They tried to pull that truancy trump card on me, so I brought them code citations proving that there were no laws forcing me to go to school.  So, as Mark Twain said, "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."   More's the pity for the schools.  They lost one of their premo test takers while I took my sabbatical.  (My mind is perfectly geared to school tests - I learn quickly, memorize quickly, and then after a short period my brain purges all information, like a neat-freak cleaning out a refrigerator.  This is in contrast to my husband's brain, which is more like a neat-freak organizing their CD collection.  The stuff he can remember makes my brain hurt.)  While on sabbatical I did a lot of reading and art, and tried very hard to get my writing career off the ground.  By the time I was 15 I had a pretty good collection of rejection letters.  By 17 I took a bunch of tests and started college six months ahead of my "class".  What I've taken from this experience isn't that we need to do more for the smart people.  I feel that we need to value ALL of our students/children for their unique talents, interests, situations, and desires.  I'm not saying I know how to do that, but obviously someone does because those are the teachers that get stories written about them and movies made about them.  If "education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire", then those are the teachers who know how to light those fires.  From what I can tell it doesn't have anything to do with tests, structure, and systems.  It has to do with faith, passion, and dedication.  But it's also true that all the faith, passion, and dedication in the world can't make a cactus grow in a swamp.

      Just took another one of those darn addictive internet tests,  urlLink The Wedding Etiquette Test .  I got an A+.   My results: Here comes the bride, short fat and... wait, you would never say that! You seem to have the utmost respect for the sacred vow of marriage, or at least recognize the importance couples place on their "big day". Emotions are often running high at these once-in-a-lifetime events and, in addition to your gown or swanky suit, you slip into your best behavior. An invitation, after all, means that your presence is appreciated, and you want to contribute to the warm and fuzzy feelings of the day by following all the rules of etiquette. Essentially, you are well-mannered and, even when tempted, put your own desires and motives aside for the sake of the bride and groom's bliss. This is the only way to be - good job!

        The latest Iraqi attempts to recover control of the country's oil revenues from the United States appear to have hit a dead end with a special delegation being rebuffed in its bid to secure UN help.   urlLink Smirking Chimp   Yeah, so this whole thing.  It was NEVER about the oil.  No oil involved.  Not a bit of it.  Oh, by the way, did we mention that American oil companies posted  urlLink incredible profits ??  Not just increased revenue (sales) but profit (the stuff they keep).  Check my math here.  If the ExxonMobil revenue in 2003 was $65.95 billion and profit was $21.51 billion that means that profit was 32.6% of revenue.  Right?  So - if they actually got everything you paid at the pump that would mean for every $1 you put in your tank they made 32.6 cents in profit.  (There are other things in there, I'm sure, but let's keep this simple.)  My recommendation is that you drive less and invest in more energy stock.  Unless, of course, you prefer to use Cognizant Consumerism in which case you would neither invest in evil energy stock (like oil, etc) or use it.  Anyone got any alternative energy stocks to sell me?

      I knew that WalMart was evil and probably wouldn't fit into my new theory  Cognizant Consumerism (R) , and now I can see exactly how right I am in  urlLink this article . So I have to find out where the nearest CostCo is. Why should I give money to a company that is going to run out and give it to the politicians I can't stand? As well as WalMart I know that this applies to Dell Computers.

      Finally, something to get excited about again.  I missed Gore and Carter because I had to work late (and I would love to know where I can get video online because they are my favorites), but I did get to see both Clintons and tons of clips.  Bring it on?  Consider it brought.    While I was watching Bill Clinton I couldn't help but to repeat a little mantra in my head.  "Oh yeah, this is what a President is supposed to sound like."  Intelligent, articulate, and able to draw together complex international issues into a simple framework that would allow us to all work together.    I look forward to more good things from this convention.

      My Dad swears by the  urlLink Pew Research Center .  After  urlLink Jon's  little bit tonight about "America is safer!" I thought you might like to take a look at  urlLink this report  that Pew did in March 2004.  An excerpt:   A year after the war in Iraq, discontent with America and its policies has intensified rather than diminished... Perceptions of American unilateralism remain widespread in European and Muslim nations, and the war in Iraq has undermined America’s credibility abroad. Doubts about the motives behind the U.S.-led war on terrorism abound, and a growing percentage of Europeans want foreign policy and security arrangements independent from the United States.   And think.  This was BEFORE the realization that we had 'bad intelligence'.  Oh, and by the way, THIS part of the report shouldn't be any surprise:   Americans have a far different view of the war’s impact – on the war on terrorism and the global standing of the U.S. – than do people in the other surveyed countries. Generally, Americans think the war helped in the fight against terrorism, illustrated the power of the U.S. military, and revealed America to be trustworthy and supportive of democracy around the world.   These notions are not shared elsewhere. Majorities in Germany, Turkey and France – and half of the British and Russians – believe the conflict in Iraq undermined the war on terrorism. At least half the respondents in the eight other countries view the U.S. as less trustworthy as a consequence of the war. For the most part, even U.S. military prowess is not seen in a better light as a result of the war in Iraq.

      In case you haven't heard about it (what, are you living under a rock?), some Deanites at  urlLink My Vote is My Voice  have organized a gathering  urlLink near  the Democratic National Convention.

      "As I see it, a person's culture represents his appraisal of the things that make up his life. And a fellow becomes cultured, I believe, by selecting that which is fine and beautiful in life and throwing aside that which is mediocre or phony. Sort of a series of free, very personal choices, you might say. If this is true, then I think it follows that 'freedom' is the most precious word to culture. Freedom to believe what you choose. In America, we are guaranteed these freedoms. It is the constitutional privilege of every American to become cultured or grow up like Donald Duck. I believe that this is our greatest cultural blessing. Therefore, it seems to me, that the first duty of culture is to defend freedom and resist all tyranny." ~  urlLink Walt Disney

      Analyzing Kerry using astrology.  (This will be fun, go with me now.)  Kerry is a Sagittarius.  First, this means it is statistically unlikely he would be in the White House.  (Look up all those birthdays and get back to me.  There might be two.  Compare that to all the Scorpios and Pisces.)  This isn't to say that Sagittarians can't be great leaders and visionaries.  Ever hear of Winston Churchill or Walt Disney?  But I can see where there would be problems getting them into office.  So let's see how we can meet the challenges.  And what advantages he might have...  The first and most important force at work in any Sagittarian's life is the ability to, nay, the inability-not-to --- put their foot in their mouths.  They need to wear peppermint flavored tennies because at some point in the day they are going to say something that goes over like a ton of bricks.  With Kerry this has manifested with alternatively being pissy (snowboarding, anyone?) and being obsequious (flip-flop, flip-flop, flip-flop).  Any Sagittarius will tell you that when you're 95% charming and fun, but 5%... something else, it's always the 5% that seems to have unequal weight.  Secondly, Sagittarius is famed for being clumsy.  It's not just about that gangly, colt-like "grace" they have.  It includes tripping over feelings and anything else that is around while they have their eyes firmly fixed on the horizon of possibilities.  It looks like Kerry has chosen to meet these challenges (at least partially) by bringing in the most charming and affable of the Democratic contenders as his running mate.  John Edwards, typical of Gemini with his quick mind and glib tongue, should be able to ride those political waves almost effortlessly.  The most important advantage in their lives is luck.  Luck, luck, and more luck.  When they miss a train they end up meeting the most important person in their lives waiting for the next one.  When they trip over a curb (and they will - often) they'll find a $20 bill in the gutter    Ain't it lucky how everyone has rushed to see  Fahrenheit 9/11 ?

       urlLink This essay  almost made me cry.  Breslin questions the Republican's use of Jesus and the Lord in their campaigning.  Aren't we instructed not to take the Lord's name in vain?  Dictionary.com tells me that "in vain" (an idiom) means  In an irreverent or disrespectful manner .  Doesn't it disrespect Jesus to ignore his teachings and instead use him as a brandname for your campaign?

      You see them whispering among themselves.  They seem to be up to something, holding furtive meetings and saying more through body language than they would ever commit to paper or even speech.  They seek alternate news sources and sneak into movies like "Fahrenheit 9/11".  They are planning an action in 2004 that they previously thought abhorent to them.  But they have thought it through and they are resolved.  When the time comes they will push the button, pull the lever, whatever it takes.  Who are they?  Republicans.  The ones who have the lost the faith and are going to vote ABB.  They aren't just going to stay home in November.  They are frustrated enough that they will go out and vote to get someone from their party out of office.  Those of us with a liberal bent need to remember how traumatic this is for them.  Most of them aren't naturally rebellious people.  It's almost paramount to going to church and voting out God.  They have lost their faith and are wandering in a political desert.  To a great extent the current administration shouldn't be worried about the Coalition of the Wild-Eyed.  We may be loud and proud, and it is certainly necessary that we vote to be the underlying block, but the deciding factor will be the disillusioned.  They want to hold this administration accountable.  Right now it really sucks to be a moderate Republican.

      I certainly hope that people understand why some Dems respect McCain. I may not agree with him on political positions, but when it comes to matters of principle I always respect what he has to say. For instance, today's report that  urlLink McCain condemned ads that attacked Kerry's military record .   Asked if the White House knew about the ad or helped find financing for it, McCain said, "I hope not, but I don't know. But I think the Bush campaign should specifically condemn the ad."  But methinks this is a silly statement:   Later, McCain said the Bush campaign has denied any involvement and added, "I can't believe the president would pull such a cheap stunt."  Riiight.  Karl Rove is just a little snoogie-bear.

      I was up later than usual tonight and caught most of the Bill Maher show.  The panel tonight included Michael Moore, Kim Campbell (former Prime Minister of Canada), ..... and some Republican representative.  The back and forth was fascinating, especially the part where the Congressman said something like 'Farenheit 9/11 was a documentary the way that Pravda was a newspaper during the Cold War'.  Them's fightin' words.  Especially since the guy hadn't seen the movie.  Way to go, schmuck boy.  The other interesting point in the show was when they trotted out Nader and both Maher and Moore literally got down on their knees and begged him to stop running for president in 2004.  Honestly, I didn't know that Maher had the pull to get such an interesting assortment of people in the same place at the same time.  I guess everyone is making the rounds as the election season heats up.  In a somewhat related item, Bill Clinton was on David Letterman.  Although I always enjoy hearing Clinton speak, especially the parts where he can pronounce foreign countries, he said, "I agree with John Kerry" so many times I expect Jon Stewart to have an official count on his show tomorrow.

      As I've pointed out before, John Kerry is a member of that wonderful, intelligent, goofy astrological group - the Sagittarians (the Archers). They have a great sense of wonder, look for the Cosmic Truth in everything they experience, and have minds like steel traps. If I had to sum up the Sagittarian energy in one word it would be: Inspire! Hopefully the whole nation will start to see these colors from Kerry soon, because we all know we need some inspiration.  Meanwhile, I salute the Archers with some great quotes from them:     "We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire...Give us the tools and we will finish the job." -- Sir Winston Churchill,  BBC radio broadcast, Feb 9, 1941    "Tomorrow will be better for as long as America keeps alive the ideals of freedom and a better life." —Walt Disney  "Terror is an efficiacious agent only when it doesn't last. In the long run there is more terror in threats than in execution, for when you get used to terror your emotions get dulled." --Mark Twain     "(Terrorists) are planning to disrupt our democratic process. It's scary I know, but we're not going to let al Qaeda tell us what to do. In fact, our government has decided that if al Qaeda attempts to disrupt our democratic process, we are going to respond by disrupting it first." —Jon Stewart             "It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried ."   -- Sir Winston Churchill         "You don't build it for yourself. You know what the people want and you build it for them."  —Walt Disney      "The empires of the future are the empires of the mind."  --Sir Winston Churchill      "The issue of Kerry's military service has spawned a number of recent news-like events which have led to Republican charges the decorated war hero has something to hide. Because if there is one thing the Bush administration will not tolerate, it is ... other people's secrecy." —Jon Stewart  "Never hold discussions with the monkey when the organ grinder is in the room." -- Sir Winston Churchill (it's like he heard about the joint Bush/Cheney testimony!!

      When I read the AP article  urlLink "Intel That Sparked Alert Dates to 2000"  my first thought was of those silly "Born On Date" ads for beer. I was always under the impression that timing was a very important part of the spy game. You want the right information at the right place at the right time.... right? If a beer would be skunky and a soda would be flat - and both would be 'out of date' - within four years, what up with the intel??  Maybe they found an accompanying memo for "Bin Laden Determined to Strike Inside United States". Or maybe it was a memo called, "Your Administration is Toast When the Public Realizes What You've Been Doing". Not politically motivated. Right.  Furthermore, if you've had this information in hand FOR YEARS, what have you been DOING about it??  How can it represent a clear and present danger now when a few years ago it was, 'Eh, whatever...'?  It's stuff like this that may jolly well send me around the bend.

      In what I thought was a poignant reminder - the  urlLink count of American casualties in Iraq  on the day John Kerry accepted the Democratic Nomination was  911 .   urlLink Another soldier died that day .  Spc. Joseph F. Herndon, II, 21, of Derby, Kan., died July 29, in Hawijah, Iraq, when he was shot while on guard duty.  So at midnight, shortly after Kerry accepted the nomination, the counter went up to 912.
