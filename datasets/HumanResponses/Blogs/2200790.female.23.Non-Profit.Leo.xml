        1. Setting    Club. Disco. Bar. Beach. Something where the mood is everybody is just chillin’ out. The ratio of both opposite sex should be balanced. Much more okay if the statistics were unattached or just plain looking for adventure and momentary good time. Mine happened somewhere in a beach, white beach. Much, much more erotic.     2. Choose a perfect target    At huwag na huwag kang magmamaganda kung mabasa mo man ang article na 'to . You weren’t my target in the first place. Actually, I didn’t even have plans of engaging in a one-night stand. It just…  came . You came. So far in choosing the perfect target, I think you were the one who chose me. Perfect. Me? Snotty, bitchy, demanding pero sobrang pacute, caught your beautiful eyes. Or my black bikini caught your eyes. Anyway, one-night stands are based on physical attraction and not on brains or personality.   And if I ever did plan to jump in the sack for just once and period, it would be with your friend who looked like Dao Ming Si. All those flirty laughs and strutting my butt in front of your nipa called your attention, not his since he is already attached. Crossed Dao Ming Si off the list. However, you weren’t bad: tall, dark, and yeah, it did not hurt you were handsome. You just wouldn’t fall to my usual mestizo, submissive type. A first.     3. Pick-up Line    You actually used two:   Scenario 1  Annoyed that I never got pass more than one San Mig Light since I was the assigned person for the night  (lecheng Jack en Poy yan!) to make sure everyone is sound asleep inside each bedrooms before two in the morning,  I decided to get a few winks and come back for them later. You called out from the hammock I was using earlier that day for a nap.  “ Miss, hello. Ah, me yosi kapa?” “ Wala na last one nalang 'to eh.”   “ Hati nalang tayo.”  You smiled. As if that bedimpled smile would melt me. Broke the stick into half and handed him the other. Immediate smile in your face confirming both that I’m a bitch and at the same time looking for a good time. You laughed. I walked away while lighting a fresh stick.   Scenario 2  Since I cannot sleep alone, let alone in my first night in a resort and had just seen the Halloween Episode of  Magandang Gabi Bayan , I decided to go out and swim. It was a humid night, and I was only donned in my bikini and a skirt. The beach was dark and the waves were calm which was conducive for a few strokes. I sat on the sand and was trying to make breathing exercises. Relaxation. Inhale. Exhale. You suddenly plopped down beside me and handed me a cigarette. “ Since you were sooooo kind to share a used cigarette, I’m returning the favor.” I laughed. This time, I heard a tinge of flirtiness which I don’t usually hear being used to strangers. I smelled a one-night stand even if I’ve never done it before.  “ Boobsie, right?” “ How did you know?” Raised eyebrows which I doubt he saw since it was dark. “ Well, you really live up to your name… and I heard your friends call you that.” No comment. Making circling motions in the sand with my toes. “ I’m Martin, in case you want to know.” Handshake. Bingo.    4. Conversation   If the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, the way to my heart is through books. You discussed Poor Dad, Rich Dad which is like your bible. You’ve read the Alchemist which is my bible. We’ve read the same books. We both write poetry. We both share the joy of watching movies alone ( Ayaw natin yung mga may nagtatanong “Sino yun?”; “Anong nangyari?”).  We both love to eat weird food. We both patronize Pinoy music. We both don’t have time for relationships. And we swapped sexual experiences and gave advice to one another. We immediately hit it off, like long-lost friends picking up from where they left. It was funny since I really felt so at ease with you. So at ease that when you put your arms around me I did not move. So at ease that when you leaned over, I leaned forward. I could do this forever. But since we only have one night,  mag-iinarte pa ba naman ako?   Besides, I’m already smittened. Time for the next level.    5. The Birds and the Bees   I was the one who actually asked if we could walk. I was thinking that maybe we could go to the bar where my friends were having the time of their lives.  But you insisted we go the other way… the, ehhhemm, seductive part of the beach. Endless stretch of white sand and cold, romantic air. We walked and we talked and we walked some more and we talked some more. Till we reached a secluded spot. Just after the sole bonfire in the area. Strings were pulled free. Fabrics that were used to cover were stripped. To spit or to swallow. Who’s on top. Smiles.    6. The Morning After   They say that women fall in-love after sex. It’s different in my case. I didn’t. Or I thought I didn’t. Well, it was good, afterall. You were good.  And I know I WAS good . Anyway, it all ended in that note. The next day, both our friends saw us in the hammock, sleeping while holding hands. But that was the end of it. After I left the hammock, I knew that I left you with it. But not my heart.  Funny how you told me you love me when we were getting freaky. Hehehe. Men.   Sometimes I think about you, wondering if and when we are still going to see each other. But I guess it all depends on the deities of LUV. Wahahahaha. Love.  Diba hindi nga ako nain-love?      Shit, why am I writing this crap?!

       They.  They are getting married. And I am invited. I mean, I should go, right? I don’t know. My decision to go or not would confirm if I am really over him. But I’m definitely over him! I think… This just sucks! Me, the ever goody-two shoes person befriending the current of my ex. And where did that land me? To a wedding invitation I didn’t even have nightmares to dream about! An invitation. Maybe I should pretend I didn’t get it. No, the bride personally gave it to me. An excuse that I’m sick? Too old and used to be used as an excuse. I don’t wanna go to the wedding! It would mean seeing his old friends again that became my friends then my ex-friends when he became my ex-boyfriend. I just know they are going to laugh behind my back and snicker when I pass by them. Was it my fault? I just saved the both of us a lifetime of misery and regret when I turned down his marriage proposal. Commitment is really not my thing and at least I had the decency to stay in the relationship for exactly a year (returning the ring exactly a day after our first year anniversary which was a day old in my finger). Of course I hated myself afterwards! I even tried to get him back! But he was so mad at me that he almost hit me. But he didn’t. Because way back then, he still loved me. He loves me not now.  He said I was right: We weren’t meant for each other, not now not ever, not even when we were together. We just compliment each other and were physically perfect in bed. And we proved it again last night when we jumped into bed faster than you could say fast. But the again, how could I best wish her bride when I just  best wished  her man the night before they move in to the house they supposedly would start building a happy family?  How?

      I'm so irritated right now. I dunno why pero sobrang na-iirritate ako. It's Christmas and we just had our Christmas party in the office earlier today. I was supposed to host the party but i felt so fucked-up that I didn't even wanna much move the whole day, much less eat. Well, at least I saw my  ultimate crush . SHET so papable talaga ang lolo mo na walang panahon. Actually, I really like him a lot. But he still treats me like a kid, kulang nalang is that he gives me a pat in the head. Kakainis talaga! Nweis, he's just 8 years my senior noh, at nasa calendar pa naman yung age niya. Tang na pa, ang cute cute ko kanina (i was wearing this white halter blouse) ang banat ba naman "San ka magbe-beach?" Ay pucha, pasalamat siya hindi ko sya sinunggaban. Wekhehehehe. Basta. Di naman ako in-love dahil wala sa bokabularyo ko yun. Pero grabe, he makes me feel so special talaga. Most expensive date, siya. I always, always blush when he gets near. Gets sweaty when he's talking to me. At naka-4 kiss na ako sa kanya yehey! 3 sa cheek, 1 beside the lips. Shet, pathetic, hanggang dun lang ako. Torpe for the first time! Pucha, when he asked for yosi nga kanina, he placed his hand on my thigh for more than 5 seconds! Sick ko  noh? Pero sobrang infatuated talaga ako. He's not that good-looking naman, pero grabe lakas ng sex appeal mala-vortex of power sucking me to its depths.  BAGAY TALAGA KME . I mean  BAGAY TALAGA . Our offsprings would be giants. HAhahahaha.   Dish ish not hafening! I canut pol en lab! Hindi nga!   Three days lang to cleanse myself again and get rid of thougts about him, then up and about na naman ako! BUt I think, I think, I might be eating my words this time around... Boobsie, get a hold of yourself: He's getting married next year. Cannot be. Borrow 1 from 2.  If you ever get to read this KUYA, I'm in-love with you right this minute. Shet, baka mabasa nya

      New year, new hopes, new resolutions. I, for one, promise to find a fulfiling job this year since I resigned from my NGO work without a fall-back. Cool noh? Hehehe. Not really without a fall-back. I actually have 5 scripts in line costing P3,000 each. The problem is I don't know where to start. Just today, I ate my word of not joining the band wagon: I applied for a CSR position. Good money, flexi time, sounds ok to me.   PUTANG INA  . I graduated from the  best university  in the country and I'll just end up giving directions to some american who was born in this cruel world without the sense of logistics. Shet talaga. Pero ok ang pera. A classmate of mine (from UP ah!) told me he'll eat a live chicken given the right price (which is just 20 kiaw). Ganyan naba ka importante and kwarta ngayon? Mukha na tayo Ninoy lahat, kulay dilaw pa. I'm planning to move somewhere south after 2 years. Aklan or Davao basta as far away from Manila as possible. Labong koneksyon.  *****  Naiirita ako wala parin Peyups.  *****  I'm sad right now. My ex and I are not in speaking terms. Haven't yet gotten my last pay. Shet.  *****  Got accepted for a CRS position. Unlike other people who is desperately looking for employment, I'm actually sad I got accepted.

      People, people bear with me since I'm a music lover, narrowing my top ten fave songs proved to be a difficult feat for me (much like the way I had my first snorkling experience).

I just hope she's coming round again       I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my taoes      Everyday's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace      There's no swimming in the bottle, it's just someplace we all drown      I lost myself in sorrow, lost my confidence in doubt  10. 'Til There Was You   (Rod Stewart)             There were bells on the hills      But I never heard them ringing      No, I never heard them before      'Til there was you

        Dear Burn,    Hayup ka, nag-iba kana pala ng number hindi mo man lang nasabi sakin!!!! I tried to trace it. Nung tinawagan ko si Mike, ayun nagalit pa kasi nakikipag-dyug siya nung tinanong ko ang isang napakawalang importanteng question sa ganung panahon. Talaga oh, sus. Bakit naman ganyan, akala ko ba ako ang bestpwen mo doon? Kakainis naaalala pa naman kita lately, sa mga bagay na pinagsamahan natin at hindi.  Naaalala mo pa ba nung ako ang nag-introduce sayo sa kagandahan ng fair? Pucha, isang San Mig Light lang taob kana, ako pa kelangan mag-alaga sayo lagi kahit nakakatatlong bote palang ako. Naaalala mo pa ba nung hinabol natin si Dindin sa backstage tapos humingi ka ng autograph sa 100 mo, tapos hindi na  niya binalik??? Wahahaha, miss ko na yun grabe tawa ako ng tawa. Eh nung tang-na jamming na tapos nakikihalo tayo sa mga lalake kahit nagpapatayan na sila sa kakahead-bang? Tapos si Marx yung sumasangga sa kanila (as if naman kaya sanggain ng payat niyang katawan) yung mga lalakeng bumabangga satin? Astig un grabe. Tapos nung lasing na tayo pareho at puputok na malapit ang ating mga water bags hehehe, umakyat tayo sa Vinzon's at naki-weewee sa CR ng mga lalake kahit may mga lalake dun. Tapos pag mga 2 na, retreat na tayo sa tambayan para matulog kasi sarado na ang dorm mo; dun lang tayo nila Ferdz hanggang kainin ng maraming lamok. Those were really the days.  Eh, yung first Chritmas Gift ko sayo, yung bottle opener na mga liquid design sa loob na regattas? Anu ba yun? "  Our friendship is like a freshly opened bottle  ." Naks. Eh yung regatta design? Wala lang, just wanna share with you my love for beaches. Dami narin natin pinagdaanan, pero kahit kelan, dipa tayo nag-away. Pano ba naman eh puro kababawan ang alam natin pareho.  Pero naaalala ko nung anjan ka nung sobrang malungkot na ako nung umalis si Rhett papuntang Canada and I never got the chance to tell him na mahal ko siya kasi natatakot ako dahil matanda na siya at 3 years siya dun baka mapunta lang sa wala?  2nd sem, 3rd year . Hayyyy. Sabi mo okay lang yun, kung kami talaga, wala na makakapigil pa nun. Tapos nung nain-love ka dun kay Randy pero may dyowa. Tang-na ramdam na ramdam ko ang sakit mo nun habang umiiyak ka: feeling ko, ako ikaw. Ayokong nakikita kang malungkot kasi hindi ganun yung friendship natin, lagi lang tayo tawa ng tawa. Tayo ang buhay ng tambayan diba, lalo na isama mo si Eli, Habs, Jefer at ang honoraria member na si Pat? Shet, gulo 'to at galit na naman ang katabing tambayan!!!! Hehehehehe. Miss ko na talaga yun, yung mga kabastusan natin. Sana nga minsan, college ulit.   Tsaka nung umiral ang pagiging inggitera mo nung gumagawa kami ni Mike ng radio commercial ko, yung Nokia-Sapatos na tawa kami nang tawa kaya napagdesisyunan mong mag-BC kasi yun talaga ang course na bagay sayo? Eh ba't nung bumalik ako sa UP, Phil. Studies kana? Hmmpppp. Isang taon lang tayo nag-hiwalay eh, nag-iba kana. Pero iba yung feeling nung nakita ulit kita last June sa OUR, naiyak ako sa pagkakamiss sa iyo. Kaya nga nag-absent ako sa office para makasama ka ng buong araw sa enrollment. Pero dumating yung bf mo. Diba usapan kung tayong dalawa lang, wala na iba pwede sumingit? Hindi ko nga dinadala bf ko sa fair kasi ikaw gusto ko kasama. Hindi ako nagseselos, nagpapaliwanag lang kung bakit irita ako nung araw na yun. Pero thank you narin nung binili mo ako ng choknut na  Choklet  ang pangalan, hehehehe. Tawa nang tawa yung bf ko nun.  Ayan at hindi na naman tayo nagkikita. Every Sat ay nasa UP ako, ang haba pa ng break ko, pero parang pareho tayo walang common schedule. Minsan nga pag-gumigimik ako, tumitingin ako sa paligid baka sakaling anjan ka lang. Pero wala eh. Sa Bargo, sa Kels, sa Biology, sa Bayside, sa Trellis, sa Fussion, sa Sarah's, sa Treehouse, sa Gerry's, sa karinderia kung san minsan nagvivideoke ako, sa Starbucks, sa Seattle's, sa Goldilocks, sa Dunkin' Donut, sa McDo Philcoa, sa Mang Jimmy's, sa Rodics, sa Molave, sa Yakal, minsan sa Narra, sa Vinzon's, sa Powerbooks, sa National Bookstore, sa Adonis,kahit nung nagpunta ako Davao, hinahanap parin kita. Ganun kita ka-miss. Pag nagpunta ako Camiguin, malamang hanapin na naman kita. Hayyyyyy.  Bakit ba kita naiisip ng ganito?  Ang dami ko kasi pinagdadaanan ngayon, mga personal issues. I'm taking them all seriously. Actually, sinisira ko nga buhay ko ngayon eh. Sana anjan ka para mag-usap tayo, wala lang para gumaan na naman yung feeling ko, yung tipong sa sobrang light ng isip ko, nakakapag-isip ako lalo ng maayos. Ganun ako pagkasama kita eh, masaya at magaan. Sana nga mahanap ko na yung number mo para magkita naman tayo. Miss na talaga kita eh.   Miss na miss.    Nga pala, tuloy paba ang pagsasama natin kung wala pa tayo significant other pagdating ng 30?    Sana....

      Ako'y isang damakmak na gaga. Wala akong ginagawang matino. What if tapusin ko mga scripts ko? Tang na gusto ko na burahin Friendster account ko ang gago kasi. Hindi ko mahanap si Karen, hindi ko mahanap si Bot, si Alex, si Dayds, si Dindin, si Trace, si Kim, si Paul, si Jomar, si Aweqs, si Buryong 2003. Pakshet oh.  *****  Pati Peyups nabobore na ako. Toma nalang ako later after editing.  *****  Miss ko na si Cla, Juli, Carol at Marty. Pati si Mommy Malou ko. Anu ba yan.  *****  Gusto ko na mag-quit sa Yosi, hindi ko lang alam kung kelan. Panu ba naman, halos lahat ng barkada ko nagyoyosi. Si JP na pinsan ko, nagyoyosi. Yung sis ko, nagyoyosi (humihits pa nga sakin). Si Gardo na mahal ko, nagyoyosi. Si Ronald na classmate ko sa SOLAIR, yosi-mate ko in-between breaks. Si Arthur na kasama ko sa Galera, nagyoyosi na ngayon dahil sa impluwensya ko. Nakakayosi naman ako sa harap ni Mama kaya lang ngayon eh may rule na wag ko raw gagawin yun kasi papangasab nya raw sakin pagnakita nya raw ulit akong nag-yosi sa harap niya. Si Mike at Burn na tropa ko sa Lakan, nagyoyosi. Si Juli na officemate at confidante ko ngayon, nagyoyosi. Si Marty na mahal na mahal ako kasi nakikita nya raw yung anak niya sakin, nagyoyosi (binigyan pa nga ako Capri). Yung Syota ni Carol, binigyan pa ako ng 2 kahang Dunhill (da best). Si Mommy Malou, marunong ng kung anu-anong tricks sa yosi. Si Majal binigyan ako ng isang kahang YSL. Si Alvin na pinaglalawayan ko sa pagnanasa, lagi akong inaalok ng West Ice. Si Skipp paborito ang Strawberry DJ Mix. At ako ang walang patumanggang babaeng mahilig sa Lucky's or Marlboro basta menthol. Sarap hithitin.   Sarap magyosi pag nag-aaral. Sarap mag-yosi kung tumotoma or kung busog ka. Sarap ng yosi kung may kasamang masarap na kwento. Sarap ng yosi after a good laid. Sarap ng yosi kung wala kang magawa at kelangan mong mag-isip. Gusto ko naman mag-yosi pero ang isa sa mga New Year's Resolution ko ay bawasan ang pagyoyosi. Kaya tuwing weekends nalang ako magyosi. Dati, nakakatatlong kaha ako a week. Ngayon, goodluck kung maubos ko ang isa.  *****  Song of Lani Misalucha in the background. Positive one, himala.  *****  Namimiss ko si Eli. Kapag me kailangan akong Film Term na laging nasa tip of my tongue, siya ang nilalapitan ko. Boy Bastos, magparamdam ka naman oh. Ganda ng Kill Bill! Alam ko napanood mo na yun, kaw pa?  *****  Kasama ko ang kaibigan ni Ben kaninang umaga. Humingi ako ng payo.   *****  Pagdating ng 4am kanina, tinext ko si EJ. Sabi ko samahan niya akong mag-isip. Ok lang sa kanya kaya tinakas niya yung motor ng utol niya. Pagdating ng 5, we were traversing Luneta na. Ang dala ko lang ay P100 pero gusto ko sumakay ng kalesa. Mabuti nalang mabait si Manong Kalesa at pumayag sa P50 for a 30minute joy-ride. Ang sarap ng hangin at ang mga panaka-nakang busina ng mga bus. Ipinikit ko ga mata ko tsaka nalang ako naiyak. Tinanong ako ni EJ kung bakit. Sabi ko, nahihiya ako ke Rhett. Padating na siya sa April. Wala na siya aabutan kase binaboy ko na ang sarili ko. Natawa siya. Bata pa raw ako. Maiintindihan ni Rhett ang lahat kase  pinanganak daw yun sa mundo para intindihin ako . Natawa ako. Hinawakan ni EJ ang kamay ko habang pinupunasan ang mga luha ko.   *****  Bago umalis si Rhett, 19 palang ako nun at wala pang experience whatsoever. Sabi nya, we should give each other daw the freedom to test the waters around us. Sabi ko, water na kasing laki ba ng balde? Sabi niya, mala-bathtub naman daw. Ok, fine. Di niya alam,  sa Pacific Ocean ako naglaro .  *****  Pumili ka: Japan or US. Sana makuha ko na ang scholarship ko for next year sa Japan. Or baka I'll stay for good na sa Philly next month. Choices, choices, choices.  *****  Trabaho muna.

      Ayusin ko na raw buhay ko sabi ni Jovan. Masyado raw akong karnal. Pucha, naloka ako nung na-mention niya yung word na Karnal. This is coming from a guy na resident puta ng barkada. Last year, apat-apat ang syota. Tumaas nalang kilay ko.   Sinundo niya ako kanina sa Philcoa after a tryst with a schoolmate. 1am yun Day! Ganyan naman sa barkada eh, saluhan kung sino ang nasa alangan. Mahal naman nila ako. They have no other choice, ako lang ang  babae samin. Nung nakita niya ako, kulang nalang batukan ako. Minura nalang niya ako. Pagnalaman daw ni Badong to, hihimatayin daw yun sakin. Irespeto ko naman daw sarili ko. Puta, mga hayup tong mga lecheng to.   *****  Minsan habang naghihintay sa class, kausap ko yung mega Kras ko na si Merryl Boy. Nagtataka siya kung bakit daw ako nasa Social Development World, in fact, nagtaka pa ang gago kse nasa SOLAIR ako. Hayup. Ang packaging ko raw kase pang-theatre. Oo na, chikadora to the max ako pero pare, may laman naman utak to. Certified 100% UPCAT passer and UP Graduate to! Nahinto nalang ako sa sinabi nya. Ang naibanat ko nalang ay isang mataray na "What's that supposed to mean?" Kung director ako at siya ang artista, malamang isang malutong na mura ang natanggap niya sa pagbu-buckle ng sagot niya.   Cut direk! Pack-up nato!  *****  Wait lang, magtatrabaho muna ako. See ya later.  *****  Naloka ako sa training ko kanina. I'm just editing this piece kaya malamang yung registered time nito ay dapat 8 hours after. Ayun, with a pool of writers from different broadsheets and tabloids, I felt totally outta place. Cellphone ko lang hawak ko samantalang sila ay mga Palm Pilots.

      A while ago, I was standing in front of the mirror with an electric shaver in my hand. I was staring hard and was planning to shave my head shitless. I thought that this would help me solve the problems bothering me for quite a time now. I'm emotionally unstable and nobody knows. I don't want them to know. Actually, nobody can help. I'm in a destructive mood to punish myself for all of the sinful things I've done.  Suddenly, my cousin knocked on the door.   "Ate, phone. CSE daw."  I put down the shaver, but before doing this, I intentionally slashed a bit of skin on my left wrist. It left a dry, but stinging mark.  *****  I just replied to Buryong's e-mail. Hopefully, he'll find time to tour me around Maryland next month.   He recommended that I see the film Love Actually. One of his recent finds. It wouldn't be shown here until next month.   I'm in US next month. The film had stopped screening there. So tell me, pano ko sya mapapanood?  *****  Life is starting to tire me.  *****  On the other hand, I can't shave my head completely. I have a small keloid at the back of my head. From stitches given when I was two when I slipped and bonked my head on the bathroom floor.  Sagwa tignan.  *****  A couple of days ago, I passed by Paz market on the way to Paco Church for the 630 mass. There was this woman selling windchimes (the wooden kind) for only 30 bucks. I was tempted to buy one. I used to give windchimes as gifts to my close friends. Ewan ko ba, pero the sound of a windchime soothes me. Until now.  But I live in Manila. No use buying one since hindi siya magki-kingle: wala hangin.  *****  Peaches is the only girl I loved in my entire life. I think she loved me too.

      Last night, I was with a few highschool friends in Bulacan for a small gathering. Actually, a handful of guys were there, including Delton, one of my Katarantaduhan mates in school (with Cris Leo, triumvirate kame). It was one of those kitaan moments na wala lang, hang out, foodtrip, videoke. Me, Delton, Conrad, Nesh, and Alex were belting out Ogie Alcasid, Celine Dion and Avril Lavigne songs. Mga adik nga kame last night.  One of those in attendance, who shall remained unnamed, is the girlfriend of the guy I loved for almost 10 years to date. She was one of those who weren't participating in the fun: KJ to the max. Actually, bitter pa ako ng konti. Kung sa pagandahan lang naman eh, rosy cheeks lang siya. Hanapin niya ako pag-summer, lagi akong rosy cheeks!  Nweis, I tried to push this girl to the limits of revealing the status of her relationship with DA GUY. Not bad: 5 years and going stronger by the day. No sex yet (which, for some reason, I actually believe), no plans of marriage, and the relationship is illegal on the girl's side. So far so good.  A small conversation transpired between the two of us. Maybe tama lang ng San Mig Light and Growers yun, but I still remember everything that was said.   ME:   Gurl, si Che, tibo (chika lang). Mahal natin lahat yan. Panu kung ang paraan lang para maging babae yan eh isang gabi ke DA GUY?    GIRL WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED:   Ummmmm    ME:   Hindi na pinag-iisipan yan, magkakaibigan tayo lahat dito. Oo lang o hindi....    GWMNBN:   Siguro. Sige. Kaibigan ko naman si Che eh.    ME:   Ako rin diba? Friend mo?    GWMNBN :  Oo naman.    ME:   Gurl, tibo rin ako.   Tumahimik si Gurl. Nilayuan na ako buong gabi.  *****  Alam ng mga highschool friends ko kung gaano ako ka-baliw ke DA GUY. Nung nag-comment nga si Gurl last night na wala nang popogi sa boyfriend niya, mega agree ako. Kulang nalang magpagawa ako ng imahe ni DA GUY. Hanggang ngayon kapag nakikita ko si DA GUY, walang patumangga ang pagba-blush ko.   Mahal ko si DA GUY. Minsan nga kaya ko iniisip na wala akong matinong relasyon, kase lagi kong hinahanap si DA GUY (hindi lang yung qualities) sa bawat isa sa kanila.  I'm such a romantic freakazoid.  *****  Was in DLSU earlier this morning. I remembered Rhett. Last time I was there, we were getting his TOR. When I stepped on his campus, I felt totally outta place. I know I don't belong in his world.   He's coming back this summer. I miss the pratt terribly.   *****   You're in-love, that's the way it should be Coz I want you to be happy You're in-love and I know That you're not in-love with me Ohhh, it's enough for me to know That you're in-love I can let you go Now I know that you're in-love     -- Wilson Phillips

      Are you ready?   Are you in?  *****  I was just reading the Friendster account of my cousin (who is also must not be named) since he has a reputation to protect. He was a heartthrob of Engg in UP (aha!clue), and undeniably good-looks run in the family hehehehe. My gash! My cousin is now a Civil Engineer! At ang pogi pa! Luckily, he gained some weight thus, more good-of-a-catch than before.  But before I shower this guy with flowery praises, I just wanna ask,  " Are you gay?"   You know cousin, I love you too much to condemn you (Aba, line yata un sa Drakula). You said you are  in a relationship . Mars told me that you are very picky when it comes to girls, and you never had a girlfriend in your entire 5 years stay in our beloved university. So, ummm, I'm gonna ask it point blank (again)  " 'San, bading ka ba?"  Your pictures in friendster are with guys, or some other pose that I know screams too much like  "I'm a friggin' model. A friggin', gorgeous gay model at that!"   Sobrang ok lang cousin. Hindi naman ako dinis-own ng family when I confessed that I was a lesbian at one point of my life. Pero sana sabihin mo sakin. Sobrang proud yata ako sayo, alam mo ba un? Ok lang yan sakin.   Pero ang cute mo talaga. Buti nalang pinsan kita! Hehehehe.  Patusin ba?   *****  Cla, remind me again why I don't wanna work in Makati.    1. Dress Code.   Can't possibly wear those corporate attires unless I'm a CEO. And all of my clothes are either too casual, or too pang-gimmik. Or too formal (I love dresses and I love dressing up for an occasion). Too lame but this is my primary reason. And I can't wear make-up. I don't want to. Last time my mother gave me this huge Estee Lauder make-up case, I literally got lost on what and where to put and use this and that. I can manage with lip gloss. Don't dare give me a lipstick, pang-uungguyan ko lang yan. And I can't wear heels. I'm too tall for heels! Hell heels. I'll look like a giantess! And I love the feel of air between my toes. Maganda naman kuko sa paa eh.    2.  It's all about the Money.   You know, all those people working looked like they have so many money when in fact, all they have are a bunch of bills and a gazillion credit cards wherein payment racks their brains. In our work, at least kahit mukang kalat tayo, madatung naman tayo. Makapal ang wallet sa bills, hindi sa credit cards.    3.  I can't Financially Survive.   I mean, I can't talaga. I'll be forced to drink Starbucks coffee everyday. I'll be forced to eat those moist cookies of Mrs. Fields. I'll be forced to save up for a Burberry bag and umbrella. I'll forced to buy original CDs. I'll be forced to eat in fine dining restaurants almost everyweek, when I only do this once a month. I'll be forced to visit all the gimmick spots in Makati like the Dream Bar, Temple, Tequila Joe's, etc. instead of the diversified crowded areas of Nakpil and Adriatico. I'll be forced to read intellectual sounding books like umm I don't know! when I just enjoy digesting pinoy authors with book titles like Ladlad, Virgintarian, Dogeaters, Bongga ka day!, and Gagamba. Cannot be. (Shakes head)    4.  I wasn't born to serve imperialist/capitalist.    *****  One of the quotes in an e-mail forwarded by a friend:   "Di na kita hinintay kase napapagod na ako. Yoko na masaktan kase ayoko na umasa. I'll try to move on pero babagalan ko --  para kung sakali, mahabol mo pa ako ."   *****   Are you sad that you rejected June?    Actually, hindi ko siya ni-reject. Parang nainis lang ako sa ginawa niya nung humingi siya ng tulong sa pinsan ko na magpaligaw. Parang, hindi paba obvious na gusto rin kita? Ang shonga! Nag-wawanportri narin ako, nagtatanong pa kung pwedeng manligaw?! At tingin ko nairita nung nalaman yung nangyari sakin sa Galera.  Nakita ko yung account niya sa Friendster a few weeks after that. May girlfriend na siya at mukhang mahal na mahal siya ni girl. Ok lang, he deserves to be loved because he has so much love to give. Yung testi nga nung girl sa kanya yung kanta ni Keith Martin na "Because of You." Nung una, corning-corni ako. Pero lately, tumatagos na yung message nung song.  Sabi niya sa kin before ang kanta niya raw sa "Officially Missin' You" ni Tamia. Ang hirit ko kanta yun ng babae kase nag-break sila ng guy. Ngayon ko nalaman na kanta ko pala yun sa kanya.  Sorry, yes or no lang yung sagot dapat, mejo napahaba, hehehehe.    Ok lang, at least nakaidlip ako ng konti. Next question: are you ready and are you sure?    Yes. I'm ready and I'm sure....    Sige. Pano na si Baby mo?    Umm, si D____? Nung nakipag-break ako last Christmas, nagunaw yata ang mundo. Ang ganda ko diba? Well, he tried to get me back. Pero ayaw ko na talaga. Nasasakal ako sa relasyon namin. Ang daming bawal. Di ba ang dapat na bawal lang ay bawal na gamot? Naku, sa kanya lahat bawal. Bawal gumimik. Dapat asa bahay na ako ng ganitong oras. Bawal kausapin ang mga X. Sakin mo pa binawal yun, eh Ms. Friendship kaya ako?  Katext ko lang siya kagabi. Two weeks ago lang ay hatid-sundo ako. Pero lately, hindi man lang magpaparamdam kung hindi pa ako magmi-missed call. Tinanong ko siya kung me problema. Nagalit kase naaalala ko lang daw siya kung wala ako magawa. Tama naman siya.    Tinanong ko rin siya kung may iba na. Hindi na siya nag-reply.    So, anu tingin mo dun sa sagot niya?    Obvious ba? Ayun at nagsyota na ang lolo mo. To think sabi niya hihintayin niya raw ako kahit ilang years pa! Ang gagu.    Kasalanan mo gaga! Bago kapa makahirit, next question. Masaya ka ba ngayon?    Impossible as it may sound, I can't further elaborate on the question. Pending.    Baket?    Ang happiness ay relative. Pero kahit relative na nga yun, hindi ko masabi kung masaya ako ngayon. Masaya ako kanina kase nakita ko dun sa opening ng park malapit sa bahay namin, pininturahan yung fish na parang slide ng stripes ni Nemo. Small things make me happy.... momentarily. But general happiness? Malabo.    Inaantok kana ba?    Hindi pa, pero I need rest kase may medical check-up ako bukas.

      Wanna-be instrument player ako. Napakalaking balakid sa buhay ko ang hindi ko pagkakaroon ng talento na maglaro ng isang musical tool. Pero nasubukan ko na ang mag-try.   1st Attempt:  1st year HS. Matiyaga ang lalakeng mahal ko magturo ng gitara kung matiyaga ako matuto. Pero hindi. Juice ko! Why would I waste my time trying to memorize the guitar chords when the time could be spent boy-scoping?? Bear with me, kaka-enter ko lang ng adolescence niyan kaya nauunawaan nyo ako. I know.   2nd Attempt:   4th year College. Wala akong magawa, hiniram ko guitara ni Lad at chordchart ni Komang. Nabuo ko naman yung kanta ng  Parokya na "Harana" at yung "Follow Me" ni Uncle Kracker . Pero tapos nun, nahumaling naman ako sa mundo na pelikula. Mas gusto kong gumawa ng weirdong anggulo sa videocam at mag-iksperimento ng iba't-ibang ilaw. Imbes na bumili ng bagong guitara sa Cebu, minabuti kong mag-Boracay para kumuha ng inspirasyon sa plano kong debut Art Film.   3rd Attempt:   1st year MA. kinokontrata pa namin ni Delgado si Don na turuan kaming mag-drums. Actually, sinubukan ko rin tong instrumento na to sa tulong si Tone nung College. Kaya lang, nabali ko yung binili kong drumsticks sa inis sa kanya. Ang labo kase niya eh. Pabili pa naman ako ng drumkit nun. Nweis, sana nga matulungan kame ni Don. Mabait naman si Don. Kaya lang, may HD siya ke Delgado at baka puro googly-eyes lang ang makita ko. Understudy pa itong option na ito.  *****  My mom started playing the piano when she was still in elementary. She started with the Mary Had a Little Lamb piece. Eventually, she moved on to sonatas of Beethoven and great musicians alike. She knew her power in front of the keys.  I was the unlucky child chosen to be forced to study piano. My mom hired a tutor when I was in Grade 4. The tutor eventually gave-up after a few weeks of futile attempts to get through the Happy Birthday piece. I was always unattentive.  My mind was wandering to places I dreamt of going to.  But at that time, I always imagined I was in Disneyland. I was singing the Bambi soundtrack.  My mom was quite disappointed. I think I still disappoint her up to now.  *****   In memory of those who are  FEARLESS    *****  The results of my medical check-up were ok. My hemoglobin deficiency is gone (yehey) and but I have to go back after 10 days for another urine sample. The Medical Technician said that there were  Too Many To Count   ummmm I dunno what the hell.  *****  I'm so fucking bored!!!!!!! I want coffee.  Coffee! Coffee! Coffee!   One Kafeng Varako plez?  *****  I was playing charades the other day with friends, most of them were gay. Grabe, ang saya. The theme was Pinoy movie titles. Ang gulo sobra!!! Imagine how could you act  Calvento Files: The Movie ? Of course the other group rebuked with  Maggie dela Riva Story.  Ang saya. Eventually, everyone decided to stop using  THE MOVIES  or else no group will score.  My group lost.  But it was worth the fun.  *****  ....I like the innocent way that you cry from sappy, old movies you've seen thousand of times.  ....I could list a million things I loved to like about you. But they all come down to one reason: I could never live without you.  *****  I really need coffee. Blog is getting in the way of work and studies. I'm depressed again.  *****  I will never forget the look of my stool sample. I can't believe that thing came out of me.

      I've been staring at the monitor for 2 solid hours.  TWO SOLID HOURS . I'm not even surfing the net, just staring....  I wanted to write something about what had happened between us. Sayang, blog entry pa rin.   But still, inspiration escapes me.   May dapat bang isulat? Kasulat-sulat ba?    You asked me if I'm gonna write our escapade here. Actually, I really forgot the details. Honestly. I can't even remember your face! All I could think of was how itchy your beard was and how hot it was in your room.  Wala eh.   You know who you are.  But I doubt if you'll get to read this.

      Saw the latest version of  "Eto ang beat sabay-sabay"  of Coca-Cola with the nuns. Was laughing my head off even after a few viewings.  Bet ko talaga. Even yung first version. Another  Karen-Gina  success in the TV commercial biz.  *****  I can do good Irish accent impersonation. It makes Cecil laugh. Even Reni. And Joey. Ay, Joey laughs pala on my Hindu accent impersonation. Sometimes British, but not that good. American slang? A bit but I tend to get  too maarte.   *****  Naiirita ako ke Don. Sobrang tinira niya ko last Saturday. Hayup yun. Ginago ako. Binalahura pagkatao ko. Panu ba naman ha, nung nagtanong si Teodosio what we are currently reading right now, sabi ba naman ako raw Xerex. Pakshet talaga yung lalakeng yun. Don, malapit kana buminggo ah!   1.   Nung sinigaw mo sa hallway na tama na ang sex ko. Pakshet, dapat you, of all people, should know na may image nako sa lecheng lugar na yan. Dagdagan mo pa.   2.   Nung tumawag ka na asa Boracay ako para itanong lang yung number nung isa nating classmate. New Year yun pare, sana man lang binati mo muna ako noh.   3.   Nung binuking mo na naging kame ni X minsan. Dinedeny ko nga yun hanggang ngayon eh tapos pagkakalat mo? Daig mo pa si Boy Abunda.   4.   Nung hindi mo binalik yung readings ko nung first sem sa 201. Exam pa the next day.  Grrrr.   Kung tutuusin marami pa akong bagay na pwedeng isulat dito kung bakit ako naiirita sayo. Pero sayang sa blog space. Atsaka binabasa mo rin to. Minsan nga inisip ko yung mga magagandang bagay na nagawa mo sakin. Naoover-ride naman niya yung mga katarantaduhan na binibigay mo.  Tinanong ako dati no Delgado kung type kita. Actually naging Kras talaga kita kase akala ko Mountaineer ka, ganun kase porma mo. Then you had to open your mouth! As the line goes,  the rest is history.  Downfall na after nun. Buti pa si Merryll Boy.   *****  Napakadali kong kausap na tao. Ako yan. Madali kausap. Kung ano gusto mo, sige dun narin ako. Ganun ako. Kaya naman wala masaydo nag-aalangan humingi ng tulong sakin. Or magpasama kung san-san.   "Boobsie, samahan mo ako sa Raon. Kelangan ko ng RCA cables."  "Eh, baba kalang Raon tapos hanapin mo yung James Electronics. Yun meron, 25 lang isa."  "Naman Boobsie! Sige na, baka mawala ako! Tsaka magaling ka tumawad eh."  "Me papers akong deadline bukas. Tapos nag-uwi pa ako ng work. Tsaka hindi ka mawawala, kilala yung store na yun. Wala ring kikidnap sayo, ang laki mong  bakulaw."  "Sige.... Pero pag si Boy...."  "Bwiset! Sige na nga! Ayan na naman tayo! Sandali lang magkita nalang tayo sa Dunkin sa Taft, 30 minutes."   In the end, napapaikot din ako. Ayoko kase na may tampo ang tao sakin. Masyadong maikli ang buhay para aksayahin mo na may nagagalit sayo. Tsaka ang hirap matulog knowing isang tao na parte ng buhay mo ay nagtatampo sayo. Pero madali naman akong kausap kung ayaw ng tao sakin. Kahit anung rason, ok na sakin. Hindi ako yung tipong  We Could Work This Out, Trust Me.  Kung ayaw mo sakin, kahapon pa ayaw ko na sayo.   "Boobsie,  I think I need space...."  (Tse! Space? Eh halos 2 weeks kang hindi nagpakita at bihira ka magtext o tumawag! Tsaka nakita kapa ng pinsan ko sa G4 sa premier na Tomb Raider na me kasamang babae na halata raw na hindi mo pinsan. Me narinig kaba sakin?! Wala!)   "Cge...."  (Ayan na Space mo!)   "Yun lang sasabihin mo? Hindi ka ba magtatanong kung baket?"    "Baket pa? Hahaba pa. Kung ayaw mo na, ok lang.  (Takes his hands into mine and looks straight into his eyes)  Mahirap aksayahin ang oras sa taong ayaw naman sayo. Kung pipilitin ko, in the end pareho tayong miserable. Mabuti na yung ganito. At least kahit isa satin masaya...."    "I'm sorry. Hindi naman ikaw yung problema eh."    "Alam ko. Ikaw."  (Natulala si X)  Like what I said, napakadali ko kausap. Kung ayaw mo sakin kase minsan hindi color-coordinated mga damit ko, ok! Diwag! Pero bago ka manlait,  pa-rebond ka muna.   *****  I remembered who bad you treated me.  But all of that was erased when one night I woke up ang caught you staring at me while I was sleeping. You were rubbing my ear. When I opened my eyes, I caught you. But you immediately closed yours.  That's when I realized that you still weren't ready.  Weren't ready to admit that you're over her and that someone new just came into your life.   *****  Pangarap ko magkaron ng Becker surfboard. Hopefully makakapag-aral akong mag-surf this summer sa Camiguin or in Siargao. Hirap din ng anda kase baka mag-summer classes din ako.  Nag-email na ako sa tita ko na pangarap ko ang isang surfboard, kahit secondhand Maui Longboard. Sana...

      Sabi nga ni John Steinbeck  " All people have this common longing to travel someday, free and unanchored, not toward something but away from something."  Dumating na sa akin tong pagnananasang ito.  Ngayon na.   *****  Galing lang ako sa SOLAIR kanina para kunin yung report ko about the effects of Globalization in a Capitalistic setting ni Robbins. Ok yung reading, easy to comprehend and gawan ng summary. Parang mala-annual report ng ADB. Nweis, pagkatapos ko dun ay nagpunta ako ng SC para ipa-repeat image yung picture ng kuya ko, dun sa may Florophoto. Sabi ng babae dun, ang pogi raw ng boyfriend ko. Ngumiti lang ako. Kaaway ko nga yan eh! Pero kung hindi ko siya kapatid at nakita ko siya hmmmm  ewwwww  ayoko parin. Mukang isang español na masama ang ugali.  Pagkatapos dun ay dapat magsisimba ako. Kaya lang ay 3'o clock na. Baka humabol ako sa 6'o clock mass. Lumakad ako papunta sa Eng'g Computer Center babay ang gilid ng simbahan. Sa may kanto kung san andun ang Yakal, mantakin mo ba naman na nakita ko si Shao?! Aba-aba nga naman. Si Shao ay classmate ko kay Yllanan sa Arnis. Bonding-bondingan kame nito! Taga-Baguio ang hitad na ito kaya nung nagpunta ako ng Baguio two summers ago, napagdesisyunan kong hantingin siya. Pero ang gaga ay nag-summer classes pala. Hayun at mega chika at nag-exchange pa kame ng numbers. Naloka siya sa cellfone ko, kase nun ako ang pinaka-jolog sa aking 3210.  Pagkatapos nun ay nagpatuloy na ako sa Computer Center. Kinuha ko ang e-mail address ko ng UP at ang pincode ko dahil baka sakaling payagan na ako umalis ng bansa ay makapag-enrol man lang ako online.  Nung matapos ko kunin lahat-lahat, plano ko pumunta ng Vinzon's dahil may unfinished business ako sa Kule. Napadpad and tingin ko sa likod ng Law, ang dream College ko. Pero dumapo ang mga mata ko kung saan natamay si Den, mga ganitong panahon din. Three years ago na yata. Abangan ng dalawang frat. Naalala ko yun kase isa si Den sa mga bagong mem ng org. At Fair pa nun. Balak ng org isang ransakan lang sa Fair. Pero nawala si Den. Hanggang ngayon hindi parin ayos yung kaso. Ang naalala ko, Den wasn't just stabbed: he was hacked.  Hacked . The word just gives me the chills.  Nilakad ko papuntang Vinzon's na ang daan ay sa harap ng Eng'g Center. Nakita ko mga nagpi-frisbee sa Sunken, Badminton, Jog, Bike, at kung anik-anik pa. Ang dami kong memories ng Sunken dahil tabi lang tambayan namin yun. Tuwing malapit na ang summer, kame kame nila Eli, Habs at Burn minsan si Mike, nagpapalipad ng saranggola dun. Sem-ender panata na namin ng mga anak ko sa org ang pagtulog sa Sunken. Minsan pag walang klase ay nagaagawan-base kame jan or kung dala ni Randy gitara niya, ayun tumitipa ang ugok sa himig ng Parokya o Eheads. Nasulit ko ang Sunken nun college palang ako. Ngayon, nakatayo na ang haligi ng fair, na nasulit ko rin. Puti nga lang yung haligi, tsaka gawa sa plywood. Nuon kase eh yero lang yan. Tsaka may malaking parachute ng Globe. Parang gusto ko tuloy sakyan pag nag-Fair ako sa Friday.  Nung makarating ako sa Vinzon's, nakita ko ang isang ka-collegemate from Film, si Bokalbs, nagwiwithdraw ng pera sa ATM. Nakilala ako pero dinedma ako. Ok lang. Hindi naman talaga kame close eh. Pero teka, batchmate ko yun ha? Bat andito pa? Hmmmmmmm. Napansin ko rin na marami me dala ng videocams at SLR cams nila. Honga pala, Wednesday ngaun, a blessing for all shooters. Peborit ng taga-Broad at Film ang araw na ito dahil konti ang tao at madali makapag-shoot. Naalala ko tuloy ang BC121, 124, 131, 133, Film 110 at thesis. Hay. Those were the days na ngarag at laging walang pera kaya nagtiya-tiyaga kame sa monay ni manong na may keso. Kebs lang!  Sumakay ako dahil me pupuntahan ako sa Bliss. Nung napadaan ang jeep sa Yakal, nakita ko si Alvin. Naknampucha naman talaga oh. Haktwali, gusto ko sumigaw nung nakita ko siya, buti nalang eh me katabi akong cute. Isa ito sa kabiruan ko sa Org kahit inis kame dati sa jowabelle niya. Walang pinagbago si gago. Teka?! Eh one year ahead saki to ah! Bat andito pa? Tsk tsk tsk. Minsan iniisip ko rin bakit hindi ko nasagad ang MRR sa UP. Pagbaba ko ng Phicoa, nakita ko si Paulo. Nung 4th HS ako, Grade-6 tong batang ito. Naku, binatang-binata na ngayon. Aba ay may goatee pa! Hindi ko na kinalabit kase baka kagatin ako.  I miss UP so much. I grew up here, my mind that is. Pag-Saturday kase, konti lang ang tao. Ang sarap talaga ng mga panahong ganito.  *****  May isang kanta ng Parokya yung aging pumapasok sa isip ko, yung  "Tungkol Sa Iyo"  mula sa album na Edgar, Edgar Musikahan. Ito ang peborit kong album ng Parokya. Naalala ko si Leo. Kamusta na kaya siya? Sana hindi na siya suicidal. Five years na kame wala communication. Pero bigla ko siyang na-miss. Minahal ko kase ang taong to. Kahit alam ko nun na may mahal siyang iba. Ganun naman eh, masaya kana dapat kung masaya ang mahal mo, kahit sa iba. Okay lang sakin yun. At least nabigyan ako ng pagkakataon na alagaan siya.  Leo, alam mo ba na ang pinakamaganda kong tulang nagawa ay para sa iyo?   *****  Kilala niyo ba si Cid Real? Natagpuan ko yung book of love poems niya sa Filipiniana section nung 2nd year ako. Naalala ko yung poem niyang  "Fake."  For you.  *****    TOGETHER   Cid Real (QC, June 1992)     It doesn't matter That we walk aimlessly to nowhere... For all  care, we can walk aimlessly forever. What matters, Love, is that we walk, even if aimlessly, together...   *****   "We're allowed to make a lot of mistakes in our lives except the mistake that will destroy us."   --- Paulo Coehlo, Veronica Decides to Die

       "Sa panahon ng krisis, bawal magkasakit...."   *****   RECORD OF OPERATION  *****    DAY 1: January 27 (Tuesday)   The Patient (Px) had her first mentruation after a week of delay. She reported to be only soaking at least a pad a day. It was just normal spotting, as to signify that a period is coming.  *****    DAY 2: January 28 (Wednesday)   Equipped with a stool sample placed in an imported Japanese tupperware, the Px had an executive check-up somewhere near the Department of Labor and Employment. There she was made to undergo a series of tests which are the following: Chest X-ray (Thank God her Yosi days is not yet over), Urinalysis (Not pregnant but will have to go back after 10 days for another test since Px is mentrusting), Stool Analysis (Normal), Blood Analysis (Hemoglobin Deficiency gone), Dental Check-up (Needs a few Pasta), and others which are of minute importance for this report.  *****    DAY 6: January 31 (Saturday)   The Px noticed that her menustration is getting heavier. There are several abnormal-sized "blobs" coming out of her. She already had soaked 3 pads for the day and it was getting worse. Even her classmate, Don, noticed her discomfort. Unfortunately for the Px, the classmate made fun of the incident, imitating a spoof commercial of Heart Evangletista's sanitary napkin product.  After classes, the Px met up with a friend in McDonald's Philcoa. They were to go home together. The friend also noticed the discomfort of the Px. The Px just dismissed it as menstrual cramps. The Px could now feel several "blobs" coming out of her while she walked. She had to position her sitting in a specific way as to not stain her favorite demin short dress which was given by a friend of her sister. When she got of the PUV in front of her house, she left a big stain on the seat and the lower back part of the clothing was soaked with menstruation. The Px could feel that the pad was really soaked and that one could almost squeeze it like a wet towel.  *****    DAY 8: February 2 (Monday)   After the Px took a bath and was dressing for work, she noticed a trickle of blood running down her left leg. She just put on a fresh sanitary pad. The mother of the Px suggested that she use a diaper instead of the usual protection. When the Px reached Quiapo (after an hour and a half of travel time) she had to change again her diaper. There were unsually sized "blobs" comming out. The Px is starting to be scared to her wits.  From this day on, the Px started wearing diapers as substitute to sanitary napkins. She consummes 4-5 diapers a day.  *****    DAY 10: February 4 (Wednesday)   The first day in another NGO for the Px. She just stayed for half day and called her mother to bring her to the hospital. The Px experienced labored breathing and she felt that her hands were getting cold.  The mother brought the Px to a nearby OB-Gyne. After an IE, the OB kept asking the Px when was her last contact; did she know she pregnant; how long had her period been delayed; did she take anything that would anticipate an abortion. The OB also advised that condom is the safest protection, not withdrawal. The Px was annoyed. She called upon her mother to confess that, she, the ever black sheep of the family, is not anymore a virgin (3 years ago, to be exact). The mother fell silent; but she did not reprimand the Px. Instead, asked the OB on the next step to do inorder to help her daughter. The OB suggested an ultrasound. The Px underwent an ultrasound and had the following results: Normal-sized anteverted uterus with thickened endometrium, follicular cyst in the left, normal right ovary. The ultrasonologist suggested that the Px undergo a pregnancy test.  The Px then resumed to normal activities after the ultrasound. She even had the strength to attend to one of her students. But after that, the mother felt that she needed to rush her daughter to the hospital. The Px's pale complexion scared the mother. After packing a few stuff, the Px was then rushed to Lourdes Hospital in Mandaluyong.  After several test, it was found that the hemoglobin count of the Px dropped to 74 from the normal 162. The Px was then given one unit of type B+ blood. The hospital OB also advised that the Px undergo a pregnancy test (which also resulted to negative). However, the doctor suggested an operation (Dilatation and Curettage) the next day to stop the bleeding.  *****    DAY 11: February 5 (Thursday)   Operation underwent at exactly 2pm. The Px was in labor room filled with mothers about to give birth in a normal procedure. After a 3-hour wait, the Px was then rolled in in the Operating Room. Arms streched out like Jesus Christ in the cross, legs with stocking like covering, the Px was then given an intravenous anesthesia and eventually woke up in the recovery room with an oxygen inhalers down her nostrils. The doctor told her that her utheral lining was 1cm thick, 0.5 cm thicker than the normal lining. It was the placenta. The nurses were asking the Px if there is anything the matter. The Px just went on crying....silently. For the lost of a week old baby. It is called abortion even if wasn't induced. That's why the urinalysis was negative. There is nothing more there. Another unit of blood was transferred since the Px experienced another bleeding during the operating procedure.  *****    Day 12: February 6 (Friday)   For a month: No swimming, no badminton, no frisbee, no sex, no nicotine, no alcohol, no caffeine, less salt.  The Px'x life is over... . for a month. Weekly consultation and IE for the Px. 30 mg iron supplements were also required.  *****   You know what hurts me most? The look in my father's eyes. It was saying "I can't believe my daughter got pregnant..." I would do anything to erase that moment.   My father and I, we have similar eyes. They are expressive, unable to contain the emotion being felt inside. Our eyes don't lie: They never did. So it was the uttermost painful event in my life when I saw that look.  My father took me home in Bulacan. Actually, I was under house arrest. Highschool friends visited and comforted; others were angry and were giving snide remarks. Nevertheless, it was a reunion.   Last Sunday, I was in the living room watching cable. I was still feeling a little bit groggy from some of the medications. I was half asleep when I felt somebody jumped in my lap. It was a girl, in kindergarten age, in school uniforn with her little backpack and small lunchbox embracing me after a day's work in school.  I could still hear her.   "Mommy, mommy, look oh..."   That thought still remains with me up until now.  It haunts me .

Nakikita mo ba yang sole star sa sky? Akin yan. Star ko yan .   Mmmmmm....    Minsan iniisip ko, do I deserve this life? Sometimes, do I deserve what is happening to me? Yung iba nga jan mga anak ng putang kapitalista tapos lalo pang yumayaman. Ako naman na walang ginagawang masama eh.... You know what I mean....    (Forehead Kiss; Puts arm around her shoulder; Silence)  Minsan iniisip ko, bakit maraming taong nagbabago. I know that change is something permanent pero sana kung ganun rin lang, hindi na Niya tayo kinundisyon na umasa na stable ang lahat, lalo na yung magagandang nangyayari.    This too shall pass....    Perfect example, ikaw. Warfreak ka nung highschool ka, kinakatakutan ka sa katarayan mo.

In the first place, I wasn't supposed to be wearing any jewelry. Pero Sunday yun, bawal magpa-formation ng COCC. Hahahaha, talaga naman oh....   (Laughter)  Eh yung inaway mo si Teacher Cecil?

Hopo, sinabi mo na yan kanina. Ba't kaba napadpad dito? Nagkita lang tayo, like what? Two Sundays ago? Ambilis mo naman ako ma-miss.    Iba ka eh.... hehehehe. Pare, sino first kiss mo?

Pangarap ko lang naman ay sumaya. Maging Happy. Yung paggising ko sa umaga wala akong nararamdamang bigat sa loob. Yun lang. Simple pero mahirap.... I can't even remember the last time I was happy...    Highschool, paglagi mo nakikita si Sir Ducanes....  (Snickers)   Hindi eh. Hindi ko nga alam kung bakit pagkatapos niya, wala, void na ako.... Incapable of loving another  GREATER  than the way I loved him...    Serious ha, ma-ICU ka nyan!  (Silence)  He doesn't know how great a loss he has without you in his life, kahit kaibigan lang...    Thanks Earl. I needed that one...  (Hugs)   *****  I first tasted ultimate freedom when I went to Davao for the first time after I graduated. That was my graduation gift. I was given the option of going to New York, Bangkok, Hongkong, or Sydney. I opted for something closer at home. Besides, from the former options, I will be chaperoned; while in Davao, I'm free to fend for myself.  So Davao it is.  With a plane ticket and enough dough to last me a month, a bravely faced the idea of going somewhere,  ALONE , for the first time in my life. I plan to swim in Samal Island and eventually end my visit in my Tita's place in Digos.   Once in Davao City, I checked-in in Manor Hotel. Twas quite expensive since they don't have single rooms. I went snorkling and saw the pawikans in Samal Island. The Taxi was cheap (there were non-aircon taxis). I visited almost all the malls in the city. Then off I go to Digos. The place of my Tita was postcard pretty. Walking distance to Mt. Apo. I stayed there for almost three weeks.   The best time in my life...  *****  I take that back, Boracay was the best time in my life...  *****  I take that back too!  Galera was the best...   *****   Dear Boom,   If ever you get to read this, I want to thank you for what you said last Wednesday. I really needed that. Nweis, I hope I can get through this. My friends miss the old me. I also think you do; I'm your cheery-upper, right? Btw, I thought you're gonna write an article about us? Our ummm Cosmic Connection, as I put it? ;)  *****   Pinalitan ang position ko. Ako ay isang   Business Development Officer  . Dunno what the hell I'm supposed to do!!!

      Nagising ako kagabi sa pagriring ng cell ko. Unfamiliar yung number na nagreregister pero hindi ko na naabutan pa yung caller para sumagot. Four missed calls na siya. I texted the person to ask kung sino siya. Then tumawag siya. Si Carlo. Hmmmmm.... Dalawa lang ang Carlong kilala ko sa buhay. Yung isa ay hindi ko pa close. Yung isa ay nasa China at nagpapaka-mongha. So sino sa dalawa? Wala. Ibang Carlo pala.  Naalala ko na kung sino siya. Itong Carlong to, naliligaw sa pinsan ko si Trish. Minsan, ayaw labasin ni Trish to, kaya naabutan ko paggaling ako sa office sa labas ng gate namin. Eventually, nakapag-usap kame ni Carlo. Marami kame similarities. Okay naman siya eh. Matalino pa. Adik nga lang. Minsan pagwala siya magawa, tatawagan niya ako at mag-uusap kame till 3am. Madalas rin ang joyride namin nito. Tinatakas niya Revo ng tatay niya at hayun at nag-iiikot kame sa lugar namin or pupunta kame Parañaque para manggulo sa iba niyang kaibigan.  Nawalan kame ng communication nung nalaman kong may feelings parin siya ke Trish. Sabi ko nga, madali akong kausap. Kung ayaw mo sakin, sorry nalang ako. Mahal ko rin naman ang sarili ko kahit papano, ayokong back-up girl lang ako.   Pero nagulat talaga ako kagabi. Sabi niya nasa labas na raw siya ng bahay. Sabi ko busina siya kung totoo.   At andun nga ang gago.   Pero hindi na ako pwedeng lumabas. Sabi ko nalang, naka-lock na yung gate namin.   *****  Speaking of vantage points, kakaiba ang vantage point ko, iba kase akong nilalang. For a person na may eye for details at alam ang minute details lalo na kung pina-edit ng video or pinaproofread, iba na ako pagnaglalakad, mas nagiging focused ako sa destination kesa sa mga taong nasa paligid ko. Nung last Saturday lang nga sa SOLAIR papunta ako ng lib. May humatak sa braso ko, si Nands pala! Nakabalik na galing Davao. Di raw ako namamansin sabi niya. Nye, hindi ko lang talaga siya napansin. Minsan rin nung bumaba ako ng jeep sa Philcoa at paakyat na ako ng overpass, may pumalo sa pwet ko. Mananapak na sana ako nung nakita ko si Marx, ang Superman namin ni Burn. Dinaanan ko lang daw siya! Ganyan talaga ako, wag mo ako asahan na mapapansin kita kung may pupuntahan ako. Suplada ako pag naglalakad.  Pero ika nga ng kantang Amazing ng Aerosmith   "Life's a journey; not a destination."    *****  Tinanong mo ako kung nasaktan mo ba ako. Sabi ko, okay lang yun, malakas ka naman sa akin. Ngumiti ka. Pero katulad ng line ni Tom Cruise sa Vanilla Sky, " That smile would be the end of me ." Nasasaktan ako kase sa halos ilang taon rin kitang hinintay, iba rin pala ang pipiliin mo. Alam ko naman na may possibility na ganun nga ang mangyari. Sus, ang laki ng Canada, marami pa magaganda at charming na babae na pwedeng numakaw ng puso mo. At meron nga. Hindi naman kita masisisi eh. Tsaka sabi mo, mahal mo parin ako. Pero iba ang pagmamahal mo sa kanya: alam mo na para kayo sa isa't-isa.   Makakapalag pa ba naman ako?   Hindi mo nga nasabi sa akin yun kahit minsan eh. Okay lang. Dun ka masaya eh. Hindi ko pa nakita na ganyan ka kasaya. Mabuti na na isa sa atin masaya kaysa ipaglaban ko pa at pareho tayong magdusa. Sana alagaan ka niya. Sana huwag ka niya sasaktan. Sana malaman niya na gusto mo niyayakap ka sa likod kung natutulog. Sana i-surprise ka niya lagi ng munchkins na choco-honey glazed kase yun ang paborito mo. Sana alam narin niya na mahilig sa Tito, Vic and Joey kase yun ang kinalakihan mo. Sana alam din niya na iniyakan mo si Tyson, yung baby pitbull mo na binigay ko. Sana alam niya na mahilig ka sa Johnson's baby cologne Regular na amoy sa unan mo. Sana alam niya na mahal na mahal mo ang bunso mong kapatid na si Pao. Sana alam niya na hindi mo pinangarap yumaman, katulad ko.   Kase yan lahat, alam ko.   Sana malaman niya na sinabi mo na mahal mo parin ako. Na hanggang ngayon ay nag-iisip ka pa. Na ako lang ang babaeng iniyakan mo.   Kase kung hindi, sasabihin ko...  *****    "It's nice to hold somebody's hand even if it's cold..."

      Hala sige! Umiyak ka! Ganyan ka naman lagi eh! Hindi mo na ginalang ang sarili mo! Lagi ka nalang nagpapagago! Ilang beses ko bang uulitin na walang relasyong pwedeng mabuo sa inyong dalawa kase and pangit ng foundation niyo? Kung hindi ka ba naman malandi eh sumama kana agad sa bahay niya, nakipagsex ka agad! Tanga! Mauulit nang mauulit yan!  Tang na, nirespeto ka ba niya?  Binastos ka pa nga! Obvious naman na wala kayong common ground at walang pwedeng patunguhan kung ano man ang namamagitan sa inyong dalawa!   Pero umasa ka parin...   At hayun, nung niyaya ka niya ulit, sumama ka. Magbababuyan lang kayo, hindi mo pa naisip na mag-condom! Tanga ka nga! Wala ka bang isip? Isa kang matinong babae dati ah? Anung nangyari? Iniwan ka lang ni Bob para sa asawa niya, iniwan ka lang ni April dahil ginago mo siya, iniwan ka lang ni Charles kase lagi kang late, iniwan ka lang ni Rhett para sa Canada niya,  tinarantado mo na ang sarili mo!  Puta, sabi mo sa mga kaibigan mo, wag kang papakaloko sa mga lalake. Eh ba't ikaw ngayon, kulang nalang gumulong ang pwet mo kung wala kang lalake? Anu ang naging problema? Pare naman,  bago ka mapagmamahal ng iba, mahalin mo muna sarili mo.  Ano, sasabihin mo mahal mo sarili mo? Please lang, please lang... Kung ganyan ang pagmamahal, wala silang pagkakaiba ng pagpapakamatay! Eh kinamusta kana ba niya after nun ha? Hindi ah! Pinabasa mo sa kanya yung entry mo tungkol sa nangyari sayo, wala siyang comment, parang hindi siya marunong magbasa!  Ano ka ba?! Iiyak ka naman?! Kagagawan mo yan, kaya pagbayaran mo! Ano sabi mo? Sana ma-realize niya ang loss niya dahil pinabayaan ka niya?  Sus, day wag ka na mangarap . Malamang ibang babae naman ang kinakalantaryo niyan ngayon! Lalaki yan pare! Kailangan niya ng butas!  Ayusin mo naman buhay mo.  Binibigyan ka ng bagong start, hindi mo ba nararamdaman? Hindi mo ba namamalayan?  Anjan, inaabot na sa iyo. Tama na muna ang mga lalake, makakapaghintay yang mga yan. Masaya ka naman diba? Wala ka na mahihiling sa buhay mo. Kung titignan mo ang daming nagmamahal sayo. Anjan si Delmar, magpapkamatay na nga sayo yan. Si EJ, tawagan mo lang, magkukumaripas umuwi yan dito sa Pinas. Si Carlo Reyes Haircutter. Si Robert. Marami naman ah. Gusto mo talaga yung hindi ka mahal!  Tanga tanga mo.... Eto bente, bumili ka ng maraming Alaxan, instant anaesthesia yun, dedo ka agad. Tumulad ka sa idol mong si  Buloy...   *****   "Bakla, biniboy, bading, badaf, syoding.

       Kuya,   Masakit yung PM mo sakin kanina. I'm crying while typing this. Kase alam ko may tinge ng truth yung sinabi mo. Pero ayaw ko parin maniwala. Denial queen ako eh. Pero masakit, Kuya. Kunsabagay, sino ba naman magtatanggol sa akin kundi ikaw? Kapatid mo ako eh. Pero Kuya, hindi ko siya mahal: hindi na pwede, may mahal na siya iba. Alam mo naman na madali akong kausapin diba? Kung ayaw sakin, okay lang. Pero na-attach ako sa tao. Kuya, for the record ulit, I don't fuck every guy I meet. At the very least, infatuated ako sa kanila. Yung mga escapades ko, hindi yun ginawa out of lust. May emotional and mental attachment din ako sa kanila. Kilala mo ba yung si Martin? Sa Puerto? Kung hindi ko pa nakilala yung sinasabi mong kalimutan ko na, malamang hanggang ngayon iniisip ko pa yun. Madali akong makuha. Weakness ko yung feeling na importante ako sa isang tao, in a non-platonic way. Siguro vulnerability narin. Ngayon kase sobrang attention nakukuha ko sa opposite sex. Flashback like 4 years ago, ako ang babaeng pang-barkada lang, never the girlfriend material. Sabi ko nun, tang na magsisisi kayo bat di niyo ko niligawan. Eventually, most of them did, modesty aside. Most of them wanted to bed me. Pero like what I said, pinipili ko naman yung pinapatulan ko. I enjoyed the attention, I still am. Pero that doesn't make me a puta.   Kuya, hindi ko siya mahal. Affected lang ako sa nangyari sa akin. Pero honestly, kung nalaman kong preggy ako and it wasn't aborted, I'll tell him and maybe try to establish some sort of a relationship with him. Pero kung ayaw niya, hindi ko pipilitin. Pero I'll give it  a shot.   Mejo pathetic nga ako, pag nakikita ko ung post ko sinundan niya, iniisip ko kung binabasa ba niya mga posts ko. Pag bigla siya nag-YM sakin, iniisip ko siguro nahihiya lang siya i-YM ako before. Pathetic pero what can I do? Smittened na ako. Bakit ko naman idedeny ang sarili ko sa katotohanang yun?  Bakit naman sa sarili ko pa ako magsisinungaling?  Hindi ko siya mahal pero may feelings ako sa kanya. Yan! Happy? Wala na ba sermon? Di ko nga alam kung bakit eh. Naiinis ako sa sarili ko. Kanina nga binabasa ko yung thread na kung sino ang crush mo sa peyups. Nakita ko na crush siya ni Alpha. Gustong kong hantingin yung Alphang yun at sabunutan at sabihing teritoryo ko na siya! Gusto ko nga i-PM. Pero ano nga ba naman ako? Wala naman ako sa kanya. Aminado na ako dun. Malamang may iba na siya sinasama sa apartment niya. Ok lang. Bawal pa naman ako eh.   Basta, bahala na.  Kung kame naman diba, kame? Pero wag sana. Kahit gusto ko, wag sana.  Kase nakatatak na sa isip ko yung baby. At kung gaano siya ka indifferent sa nangyari.  Alam ko naman anjan ka para sakyan ang topak ko. Help me out nalang, wala na sermon, please? Mahal naman kita eh.   *****   "You can walk the streets and find so much to criticize: but that would be the easy thing to do..."    -- Hardcore Poetry

      I met up with some of my groupmates this morning in Jollibee Philcoa. As usual, I was the ever late among the members. But I had a pretty good excuse: I came from Cavite to do some research work. But all irkness was erased when I set foot in the second floor landing of the (in)famous fast-food chain. My hair was sticking out in all ends. Instead of looking like a cutey Betty Boop, I ended up looking like Astro Boy. Talk about a bad hair day!!!!!!!!  *****  Wish ko bang makita ka ulit? Probably. Siguro. Right now, iniisip ako na kahit papano ay thankful ako at nakita kita last Sat, kahit biglaan. Kahit muka akong kalat, di pa ako nagsusuklay, I think you were also happy to see me again, after 4 long, uncommunicative years. Hay. Hanggang ngayon napapabuntong hininga parin ako. Mga dalawang linggo rin ako ganito.  Buti nalang sumama ako ke Burn sa Molave para sunduin si Mike. Kundi, hindi pa tayo magkikita ulit. Ano nga ba pinagbago mo? Wala, yun parin ang smile mo na kinalokohan ng napakaraming babae, kalbo ko na nga lang ngayon, mejo pumayat at pumuti ka pero same jolly person I remember:  ikaw parin yan   Anu ba pinagbago ko na napansin mo? Sus, ang dami diba? So, nagagandahan kana sakin ngayon ha? Hehehehe. Nung umalis ka, I kept making up situationers kung saan and kailan makikita mo ako ulit tapos iba na ako. Sabi mo ang girly-girly ko na ngayon, na-ditch na ang cargo pants, sneakers, at loose shirts. Pero sabi mo, iisa parin yung mata ko, yung nagustuhan mo. Hay, dami ko nami-miss sayo.  May closure ba tayo, tinanong mo. Sabi ko, yung nangyari ba,  dapat isarado, lagyan ng tuldok?  Ngumiti ka naman.  Time heals all wounds . Tama nga yung saying na yun. Kase nung nakita kita sa messhall ng Molave, ang gusto ko lang tumakbo papunta sayo, yakapin at amuyin ka. Yun diba yung lagi ko ginagawa sayo? Miss ko na yun. Nawala yung away natin 4 years ago. Nakakatawa talaga yun noh?  Panu ba nagsimula? Ayun, hindi ko dumating sa tamang oras sa tambayan ko. Ewan ko ba bat ako nag-inarte eh hindi mo naman ako girlfriend. Pero things started to fall apart after that. Meron tayong gustong i-define pero hindi pa natin kaya yung consequences nun. Nag-dedmahan; nag-iba ka ng sked ng GEs; nag-shift ako ng course. Sayang nga lang, we weren't able to spend precious college time with each other: ma-pride kase tayo pareho. Kaya naparami yung tropa mo sa Arki at nagkaron ako ng barkada sa FA, kase iniiwasan natin pareho ang AS. Nakakatawa nga eh, pareho tayong nawala sa mukha ng AS.  Tinanong mo kung may special someone ako. Sabi ko wala. Ikaw, naman tatay na, nasa US nga lang ang mag-ina mo. Dami ko na-miss, umalis ka ng UP para pagpalit sa bansa ng mga imperyalista, hindi ka man lang nagpaalam. Nakapagsorry sana tayo sa isa't-isa. Pero nung nagkita tayo, parang hindi na importante yun. Pinatawad na natin ang isa't-isa sa tagal ng panahon. Nung nakita kita, ang dami ko gusto ikwento. Marami rin ako gusto itanong. Sobrang dami. Pero kulang sa oras. May exam pa ako ng 4. Hiningi mo yung number ko. Kamalas-malasan eh nawala pa yung cellphone ko. Nweis, I know naman where to look for you. Jan ka lang sa Molave. Katulad ng dati, anjan ka lang lagi. Kaya lang nahihiya ako sayo lumapit.   Napanood ko nga pala yung Monsters Inc. last month. Yun yung huling alaala mo sakin bago kita makita sa Molave. Yun yung suot mong t-shirt sa CASAA nun, papunta ka CR. Pare, I wasn't able to say this nung nag-uusap tayo but I really did miss you. Kilala mo naman ako diba? Sana ikaw rin.  *****   I chose not to choose life. Reasons? I don't have reasons...    -- Trainspotting

      Yun nga! Halos lahat ng nakikilala ko ngayon, ang mga problema ay related sa sex life nila,  sometimes the lack of it.  Si RC, ayun at nagkukumahong magkulong sa kwarto para paligayahin ang sarili. Minsan nga pinipilit ko na siyang iset-up sa sandamakmak kong mga kakilala na gustong magpakamot. Ang gusto niya, makilala muna niya yung  DA ONE.  Sows! Kung ganyan ang siste eh wag ka magreklamo sa non-existent sex life mo! Napapagod na tenga ko. Si Lemuel naman was led to believe (by the girls he slept with) na ok lang sa babae ang one-night stands kase they usually daw don't wanna talk about it afterwards. Kaya ang sex sa kanya ay isang commodity done without feelings. I was about to be suaded by this outlook, buti nalang... Wala na siyang feeling. Pero, teka. Diba yun naman talaga gusto ng mga lalake? Ang labo, hindi ko sila maintindihan talaga. Eto namang si Rx, ayaw din magkwento pero sex-related din: He finally learned his lesson daw.   Minsan totoo nga naman yung kasabihan na  Birds of the same feather flock together . Ako? Anong problema ko sa sex life? Dati marami, sobrang dami. Hindi ko alam kung kelan ko pipigilan. Ngayon, I'm rooting for 2004 celibacy, nag-start 2 weeks ago. Hopefully I can fulfill that.  Like Rx, I also learned my lesson.  Mahirap pala if you're playing with fire. Syempre, nakasanayan ko na yung lagi may ka-do. Hindi ko maiiwasan minsan na ma-miss yun. Pero ang katapat lang nun, isipin ko yung nangyari sa akin sa hospital (see Record of Operation post), nawawalan na ako ng gana. Impak, wala na nga ako gana sa lalake. Dati, sobra akong pa-cute kung me cute or kung anjan Kras ko. Pero lately, wala na. Feeling ko nga, sinusubukan Niya din ako. For the past two weeks, 2 old flings came back to my peaceful existence. Two. Pero pareho ko rin iniwan. Bakit pa? Ayoko na rin naman.   Nagulat nga yung isa kong friend kase TIIS daw ako. Natawa ako kase iba pala meaning niya ng  TIIS: Tang Ina I'm Single!!!  Hehehehe. Himala at wala akong boyfriend. Honga, himala. Pero ayoko na. Tama na lahat pinagdaanan ko. Wala na ako gana. I'm never to love again. Never na.   *****  Miss ko na si June. Yung mga late night talks namin; yung pagtawag namin sa isa't-isa ng Panget; yung Bob Marley songs niya; yung Madonna version ng "If You Forget" ni Pablo Neruda; yung chocolate ko; yung Hanzel Mocha ko na pinaghirapan niyang hanapin; yung nasa Sunken siya habang me class ako at naghihintay; yung late-nights niya sa office at pagtulog sa ilalim ng table niya; yung free blueprint ng future house ko; yung dapat sasama siya sa Galera sakin; yung e-mails niya; yung pagbasa niya sa posts ko sa peyups; yung mga text niya early in the morning; yung linya niyang  "Eh mahal kita eh! Wag ka nga makialam!"   Miss ko na lahat yun . Nagkamali ba ako ha, June? I'm bad for you. You're too damned good to be true. Bihira nalang ang lalakeng tulad mo at ang swerte ng girlfriend mo ngayon. Na-realize ko yan noon palang; hindi lang talaga ako pwede sayo. Kakaiba ako eh.  Sorry parin sa lahat. I know I broke your heart. I hope that eventually, you'll realize that what I did was right....  for both of us.    *****   "And she believes in me; I'll never know what she sees in me...."

      I'm bored to death right now. I'm supposed to be starting my ppt for my 207.1 report this Sat but all I'm doing right now is waiting for Clebs and Mapaet to be on-line sa that we could chat. Haim so fuckin' bored!!!!! I'm wearing a white skirt and I look like a mess. Remind me never to wear anything white since you usually like to get down and dirty. Not even a shirt. The last time you actually didn't mess up a white piece of clothing was the tube you wore in Galera to cover that skimpy black bikini top. But that wasn't even white! Cream yata. Never to wear white again. But it makes me look virginal and clean....naks! But  everything is against me when it comes to statements pertaining to that . Even the hospital gown I had to don during my sick days was light blue. Hmmmm.   *****  Plans, plans, plans. Do I have one right now? None actually. Just wish to be able to get through the financial trouble I'm in right now before summer. I won't be enrolling this summer: conflict in sked. Hopefully, I can get enough out-of-town experience this season. My mom is set in going to Bangkok, envy her but I can't come. Don't have that enough finances yet. My sister and dad will be going with her. My friend in SOLAIR will be going to London to follow her oldie boyfriend.   Galera will be best this summer, I could stretch my budget for Galera. Or maybe Cecil will plan one of those package tours offered by WOW Philippines. Last year, we went to Hundred Islands and  EVERY CENT WAS WORTH THE TRIP.  Maybe I'll visit Corregidor. Check. I'll do that alone. Next will be Sonia's Garden and Palace in the Sky in Tagaytay. Maybe with my sister. I might go to Pagudpod with Brian and Philipp (cross-fingers). However, these two are pressuring me for Borocay this summer. I can't; not now for the meantime. Or I'll just drink myself to death and watch all the movies I want. Nice options, Boobsie...  *****  Kupal talaga si Charles. Etong hayup na to walang patawad. Sa edad na bente-syete, syotain ba naman ay ten years his junior? Sows. Haba na ng istorya namin ng gagong.

Binigyan ko rin to ng creamer kahit hindi siya nagkakape. Nairita to sakin kase pinaghintay ko sa Vinzons ng tatlong araw. Pinaghintay naman niya ako sa Main Lib! Gagu.

After being single for almost a year, my beloved sibling has finally found a guy she could spend boring hours with.  I was jealous . Green with envy at that. I can't believe that she actually found a replacement for Dong and Brian. I have yet to find the one who'll replace Botbot. Shet. It has been 10 long years of waiting in vain. And I still have feelings for the asshole.  My friend said that the trouble with me is that I keep looking for  Mr. Right  when actually he could be  Mr. Right-Here-in-Front-of-You . First of all, I'm not putting a gender on the next person that I'll ummm "share" feelings with. Especially if she is a total imitation of Peaches  (that would be nice...).  But as of now, I think what I really need is to discover and love myself. The other night I was counting how many boyfriends, MUs, and guys I played around for fun I had. I actually had to text some of them to ask what was our standing before. I was writing it down on my journal: in case I die, my legacy will live on to the next batch of crazy/pseudo-depressed/abnormal/weird/early-20s/commitment-phobic(not!) cases.   Then I remembered that most of these people have offered me the best promises one could pray to hear. But I was deaf to them.   Because what I really wanted was silence.   A time to hear myself.

      I should have never gone to SM Manila last night. Since I was so persisitent in looking for the book "What Color is Your Parachute?", I decided against the best to pursue the adventure in finding this treasured literary. Twas almost 8pm but I still trudged the jammed area of city hall. As luck would take it, I saw Mae. Mae, the sister of an X. With a boyfriend.   Ate Boobsie! Kamusta kana?    (Disoriented)  Ah, eh, ok lang. Ikaw? Musta kana? Musta na mommy mo?    Ok lang po. Ate Boobsie, si George, boyfriend . (To George)  Ah, umm friend siya ni Kuya...    Hi...    Nakuha mo na?    Ang alin?  (I was worrying that I wouldn't have enough time to look for the book)   Yung invitation ni Kuya. Kakasal na siya ha, sa Saturday.    Hinde...  (silence)  Paki sabi nalang congratulations ha. Text ko nalang siya.     Ah, ok.  (Reaches out)  Sana kayo na to dapat diba?   I just smiled and left the question hanging. Her brother and me had the best of times in our lives. We weren't to separate until he had an offer in Canada he couldn't refuse. It was a new relationship so I let go.  We let go . But still we continued to e-mail each other. Last time we saw each other, he already has a special someone he left in Vancouver. I was also attached at that time. But still, the feelings were there. But that was it. It wasn't gonna work out anyway.  I think at least he should have informed me that he's back in the country. I was expecting him this May. But he's back early.  To get married . What a surprise.   Now, where's that book...  *****   Mga Pers taym ko. Wala, napagtripan ko lang magmuni-muni sa mga anporgetabol ekspiryenses ko.    1.  Pers Memori  -- I think I was 3 at time. I was in the hospital and my mom just gave birth to my sister. I remember vague images of the event: me visiting her in the hospital. The memory is still hazy.   2.  Pers Hospitalization  -- I was fooling around with my brother while taking a bath. I was also 3 years old then. I bonked my head on the toilet and had to get stitches. That's the reason why I can't shave my head. I have this centipede keloid at the back of my head.    3.  Pers Boypren  -- I can't believe I'm writing this. I was in 4th year highschool and he was just a freshie. We both moved in the same circles in school. I was in the school paper and he was the youngest member of the basketball varsity.  Talk about corruption of minor!    4.  Pers 5  -- For an achiever way back in highshool, it was hard to me to accept that I actually failed two subjects in my first semester in UP. Natsci 1 and Badminton. If you knew my professor in badminton, you'll probably wouldn't ask why I failed. She derives pleasure in seeing her students fail. The Natsci thing is another story. I missed 3 exams out of the 5. I thought I could still pass but.... Nweis, I took it up the following sem and made sure that I take and pass all the 5.   5.  Pers Yosi  --  Kadiri Hope . I should have rolled a piece of paper and lit it up. It was in my 2nd year college moment; I was contemplating if I shifted in the right course. From Linguistic to BC? Hmmmm...   6.  Pers Toma --  7 years old and I knew I was an up and coming tomador. I was swimming in our backyard pool. My uncle left his San Miguel in the table. I took a sip, took a gulp.... and spit it out.  Well, some of it.    7.  Pers Kis  -- Nightmare on Elm Street? I was tired from a project with some schoolmates. I took a short nap when I felt something touch my lips, with the tongue eventually going down my throat.  Kinalimutan ko na to.    8.  Pers Taym --  Comedy Shop of Horrors! 3rd Bf (I hope he'll not read this). We were in his boarding house and he was helping me out in transcribing my thesis. After making out, one thing led to another and then...  *****   "I can feel this narcolepsy slide into another nightmare."    -- Third Eye Blind

      Euphoria would be the best word to describe it. I don't know which plane of existence I'm in right now: Past? Present? Future? I don't care because all I know is that I'm happy. I'm happy that I have you, even in a limited way.  I didn't ask for you to come. You were my protector and that was it. But still, this senseless border started fading as we reached to grasp what was already there from the start.   I don't want to ask where do we go after here.  I'm perfectly happy where I am right now.

       Grant me the serenity to change the things I can, to accept the things I can't change   And the wisdom to know the difference....    *****  I've been reading your posts and I tried to picture you one last time:  your hand clutching mine, the way I play with your lips, they way you go silent everytime I say something crazy.  Definitely, I will miss all of these. As a  matter of fact, I've been missing a lot of things about you.   I miss the usual texts : good morning MY JOY, lunch kana MY JOY, out-of the-blue I Love Yous, when I sleep I'll be dreaming of you MY JOY, anything that would catch my attention. Now, I'm lucky to receive just a text from you a day.  Heck, three messages from me would equal to just one reply from you!    I miss the fone calls . I'm not obliging you call me every so often but I just miss that you sometimes call when I'm in the middle of my work for no apparent reason. It's something sweet.... and exciting.And calls now just last a maximum of an hour. Unlike before when you were pleading that I talk to you for another minute....   I miss the way you make me feel special.  Like the mere fact of my leaving you would really kill you. That when I put down the fone on you, you would immediately call back. Now.... I think that for us, the past is just something to laugh about.   I miss the LOVE that once was there . I was feeling it before, like I could touch it, keep it my pocket.... keep it in my heart. But now, doubts are really clouding me and my instincts tells me that happy days are over.  I'm crying as I write this because I now know that those days are gone. Gone are the texts, the calls, the way you make me feel special, the love.  Gone is YOU . And I have to live with that and accept the fact that I never did once have you. Because you love her. Our hearts are made to accomodate one person at a time. My turn with yours never came. I now believe in that.  Sometimes I've been thinking if loving you was the right thing. If going beyond what I believe would be worth it.  You told me that this ride would sure be interesting and worth it in the end.   Thinking about it now, I believe that that is one of the saddest things anyone had said and promised me.  Sad because it isn't true. Sad that I would not see that day come. And this is what I believe.  I'm praying very hard that He will grant me the strength to ignore and avoid you. Because that would give me my freedom, my peace of mind, and my heart back. I know I can. I just hope I can do it...  *****   I have two appointments for the night:    1.  With my ex-boyfriend  (who just turned an ex two hours ago) -- He's supposed to pick me up in my office but I lied and said I went on field work.   2.  With this Girl  -- We had breakfast so I thought it wouldn't be that of a blow if I cancel dinner.  Can't go out. Too mental right now. Too emotional. Too depressed.  *****    "....And I'm shattered like, shatterred like your promises."     --- Rivermaya   *****   (Song playing on my mp3. Sang by Nyoy Volante and Mannos, I never really did appreciate this song before until their remake)    LOST IN YOUR EYES   I get lost in your eyes, and I feel my spirits rise And so like the wind, is this love that I am in? I get weak in a glance, is it this what's called romance? Will I be found when I get lost in your eyes?  I don't mind not knowin' what I'm headed for You can take me to the sky It's like being lost in heaven When I'm lost in your eyes  And if I can't find my way If salvation seems worlds away Will I be found When I'm lost in your eyes?....

       Tinatanong mo kung may problema ba.   Oo, may problema. May problema ako sa sarili ko. Lately kase, lumilipad ang katinuan ko. Pero ngayon, masyado akong nafo-focus sa isang bagay para ma-shut out ko lahat ng nasa paligid ko. Siguro yan lang talaga ang kailangan ko. Kasya naman patuloy kong saktan ang sarili ko.    Bakit ba?   Diba sabi ko naman na madali akong kausap? Pero dense akong tao. Weird noh? What I mean is, kung sasabihin mo STRAIGHFORWARD kung ano talaga ang gusto mo, eh di dun tayo. Ayoko na kasi yung pinapahula pa ako. Yung tipong kakapain ko pa bang bawat change ng norm na sinet mo para satin. Nahihirapan ako dun eh. Totoo lang.    Ano ba kase ginawa ko?   Dyan siguro tayo magtatalo. Kase wala ka nga ginawa. Wala kang ginawa para patotohanan mo ang mga pangako mo. Kase ako yung klase ng taong naniniwala sa pangako (kahit maraming beses na ako na-disappoint). Pero anong magagawa ko? Ganyan ang nature mo.   Eh ganito nga ako eh…..   Yun nga, ganyan ka. Ganyan ka hinubog, ganyan na ang kinagisnan mo. Kaya anu mang bagay ang gawin ko, bale wala parin. Balewala talaga. Ok lang. Nasaktan lang naman ako, feeling ko pati ninuno ko ginago. Malupit ako magdamdam. Sorry nalang.   Oo nga, sorry ka nalang…..   Kaya nga nagpapaalam ako sayo. Kase hindi ko na makaya. Sana yung konting memorya mo sakin, me respeto pa ako sayo. Kaya ko nga ginagawa to. Kase ako talaga ang lugi.  Pero that doesn’t mean na kawawa ako.  Lugi lang sa parteng ito.  Alam mo ba na history repeats itself? Sa pitong naging boypren ko, ni isa wala ako minahal. Minahal the way I was supposed to love them. Yung mga minahal ko, kahit kelan hindi naging kame. Ewan ko ba kung bakit I keep repeating the same mistake…..   Did I hear that right? Mistake?    -----------------   *****    Dear Cla,     Totoo pala yung text mga almost 2 months ago. Nung nakipag-break sayo yung mokong na yun. Yung hindi ka makahinga sa sama ng loob. Yan ang nararamdaman ko ngayon. Tipong gumagawa ako ng CER ng mga client ko, bigla nalang aagos ang luha sa mga mata ko. Tapos punta ako CR para dun umiyak. Masakit pala talaga. Parang pagkatapos ng lahat, in the end talo ka.   Ngayon ay naniniwala na ako sayo.   Pero kahit papano, may pinagsamahan naman kayo. Alam mo na kahit konti lang, naging mahalaga ka rin naman sa kanya. Kaya wala kang ibang gawin kundi ipagdasal mo nalang na makapasa siya at maka-top sa Bar Exams dahil minsan sinabi niya sayo na ikaw ang inspirasyon niya para makapasa rito; na maging masaya sila nung fiancée niya kase minsan pinangarap mo na ikaw yon; na sana matupad lahat ng pangarap niya sa buhay dahil kahit galit na galit ka ngayon at pinapangarap mo na mamatay na siya,  mas malakas parin yung panalangin mo na maging masaya siya.  Kase yun na ang pinakamagandang bagay na mabibigay mo para sa kanya sa sitwasyon niyo ngayon: ang ipagdasal ang kabutihan niya.  *****  In the end, I have no recourse but to be happy. To be happy for you. To be happy for you both. To be happy for you both because you two are meant for each other. To be happy for you both because you two are meant for each other, to cultivate and love each other’s existence.   I almost de-railed your path.   *****   "Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart."    -- Marcus Aelius Aurelius (121-180 AD), Roman emperor, philosopher

      Who says I can't be like him? As a matter of fact, I'm him. Lately, I've been turning into him. This whole FUBU thing is really getting in the way of work.  However, this entry is not about him. It's bad enough that we almost had a baby.   Last night, I met up the Ex of one of my two bestfriends in highschool. My girl was really devastated that this asshole left her without a reason. But she still very much loves the piece of shit. Just to stop my friend from bawling, I agreed to her request that I go talk to the guy.  And so I did. We met at McDonald's Taft around 7:00pm. Futile attempts to ask him what really happened led me to an almost walk-out. I said I was going home and he offered to take me home.   But he didn't take me home. He took me somewhere in a place I'm quite familiar with. And we did it.  With easy persuasion and no qualms from yours truly , I was able to consummate with someone I barely knew (I really don't know much about him).  I bet the next question from you would be  did I enjoy it?  I enjoyed the foreplay part, I usually do. But when it came to the actual fucking....  well, that's another story . You see, eventhough he is so far the biggest uhmmm thing that had entered me, I wasn't able to enjoy it as much. As a proof that he's really big, I feel like I'm a deconstructed recently virgin right now.   But still, this is not the point of the blog. Thinking about it now, I have only slept with like 7 guys in my nearly 23 years of existence in this mine-stripped planet. When I say slept with, it means that they were able to penetrate me. Disregard all those countless playing around.   I'm a sorta sex addict and I admit it.   When I came home last night after the quickie, I just realized that again, I didn't come. I wasn't able to reach my climax. I think it was far from it. Maybe the reason why I sleep around is my actual search for the Big O. I'm an actress and I have tried every trick on the book to look like  "I'm Gettin' There."  Right now, I'm running low on tricks. And I don't think I could pull another one again. Sad but my search for physical satisfaction hasn't been fulfilled yet.  There was this time when this guy I really liked went down on me and started trying to please me. I was starting to like it but then I realized that I cannot share this feeling with this guy. I loved him too much. Our relationship was on an emotional and mental plane.  Sad that I think sex is just something I do with someone I don't have emotional intimacy with. It's too carnal. But this carnality is something I enjoy and something I always look for.  It's sick and I'm sick. And I know it.  Maybe I'll stop when I meet the one who I'll be ready to share all of myself... physical  and  emotional.  *****  Funny but I'm singing the song of Britney Spears "Toxic" in my brain right now. The lines are so apt for my entry!!!  With a taste from your lips I'm on a ride Your toxic tongue slipping on mine With  a taste for a poison paradise   I'm addicted to you  Don't you know that you're toxic    I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now

      It was like this nga kanina. My boss suddenly called upon me in her office. She wanted to talk to me daw about this issue running around the office.  I was so kaba when I entered the office. Grabe! As in  my heart was beating loudly  and I can dinig it near exploding na. It was so kakakaba at kakainis at the same time. Anyways, I entered the room and there she was seating in her usual trono chair.  Yun pala she wanted to ask my commitment lang! As in yun lang! She wanted me to stay in the company for I guess more than a year. I was like WHATEVER!!!!!!!! I was making isip kanina pa what the meeting was all about. Yun lang pala. Kakainis ever!!!!! Wait lang ha, I think I’m oily na, need to retouch.  *****  Itembang lolito mo ha. Plez, plez, plez. I can tell that this guy’s inlove with me pare! Ano ba ang kakelotan at halatang may I chancing ang arrive to mech kaninatch noh when you were fooling around regarding the Siamese reason na ala Stuck on You film in Greg and Matt? Reasons, reasons, reasons. And I hate to think na you don’t like me eventhough I know you do. Kilig to the bones! Wait lang, cannot and will not understand myself. Lately I’m like this. The kuketches sa paa niko nga ay may I paint kanina with fire engine red color. But my gash, my gash! It was bloody red pala.    Yun, the kuketches ended up looking like they were murdered and eaten by termites.   *****  Naghahahap ka ba ng  ULTIMATE SUMMER KALYE  dito sa Pinas????? Pwes, look no further!!!! Punta ka lang sa kalye namin sa Paco Roman at matatagpuan mo na ang  ULTIMATE SUMMER KALYE  sa Pinas!!!!!! Yes, mga kaibigan, ito ang  ULTIMATE SUMMER KALYE  sa Pinas!!!  Mula alas-4 ng hapon ay nagsisimula na ang mga palaro dito. Anjan ang piko, tumbang preso, agawan base, badminton, touch ball at kung anu-ano pa! Pagdating ng gabi ay oras naman ng mga matatanda! Bukod sa mga mamang hubad na nag-iinuman sa kanto at baranggay-tanod, anjan din ang laro ng volleyball, taguan, at syempre, ang usong-usong  SQUIRT GUN CHALLENGE !!!! Ngunit ang maaring sumali lamang sa huling laro sa yung may mga Tsunami Blasters. Mas maganda kung Tsunamin XX Blaster. Anjan din ang mga nagbubungang summer flings!! (Jeric loves Maybel! Woohoo! Uwi rin yan sa probinsya niya pagtapos ng bakasyon!)  Kaya anu pang hinihintay niyo? Halina’t bisitahin ang  ULTIMATE SUMMER KALYE !!!!! Libre entrans!!!! Sakay na!  *****  I was chatting with a schoolmate and a friend last night who was in Maryland. It was the usual nonsense chitchat. In a desperate search for something to talk about, I ended up describing the contents of the current bag I’m using. The bag is a square white bag with the words New York splashed on the edges of the bag owned by my sister. So here it goes:  -- black rollerbrush (three years old) -- black JadeDuck Wallet (five years old) -- round and puffed violet Harry Potter coinpurse given by a cousin as a birthday gift last year -- papermate black pen -- Barbie notepad -- compact mirror given by mom’s school adviser when she graduated in elementary -- white kerchief with orange polka dots -- paperfan from Japan -- bodyshop lip balm (Last Strawberry/ peace Cla!) -- spray perfume (Lavender éklat) -- a bottle of hair glow -- keys to my office drawers and house -- Marks and Spencer Peach Bloom hand and nail cream given by Cla last Christmas -- brochures of my current affiliation -- Susan Baker teabags -- Bench facial absorbent paper -- yoyo  I don’t have an actual kikay kit like what he was expecting but I think what I have is enough to keep me going for the day. I can’t leave the house if one of these is absent.  Life revolves around these.   *****  Defense for clients meeting ended way past lunchtime. Me and my sparring partner were easily exhausted from the battle of queries and trying to find answers to unexpected questions thrown by the panel of the Credit Committee. After the harassment, I went back to my designated secluded spot to relax and compose my thoughts before battling out for the McDonald’s line in Taft.  My mobile was beeping. Three same messages:   “Hi! M Jake fr QC. Cld u b my soulm8?”   It was a fresh approach from the usual texts I receive wanting to be my Significant Other. I remembered that there was this instance that a guy texted me and said that he got my number from the bus he was riding and was challenging me to meet him. I asked him what was written and he replied saying that I give good head to any guy who wants to.  It was a total blow for me . I changed my number after that.  Another instance happened in Malate. I was in this bar called Fussion which was along the side of Remedios Circle. My group was in the balcony drinking their hearts out. I was wearing black pants and a green kerchief blouse that night. When I went to the washroom, this guy (who was making eyes on me all night) immediately followed me and offered me a drink. After a small talk, he whispered that he could do me in his car if I wanted him to. I was shocked because this was the very first time a guy approached me wanting to have a good time. It was tempting because it was something new but I gracefully refused.  Refused after we made out in one of the cubicles in the washroom.   My friend once told me that I have this aura of seduction and that I looked like I would sleep with anybody who wants to behind my aristocratic face. Hmmmm. I’ve been thinking about that comment.  Actually, I just don’t sleep with anybody. At the very least, I should be attracted to him even for just a little itty-bitty bit. I think I had said this before.  Through the course of my exchange of texts with this Jake, in the end the asshole knows me and wanted to show me his, as he put it, “GREATEST PERFORMANCE IN BED.”  Darling, I’ve heard that line like a thousand times already.  But it raised the question  why do I get this type of approaches from men ? From texts to small conversations, all boils down to us hooking up.    Punyeta.   My replies were all sarcastic and offending. But that didn’t hamper him from delivering his objective. With resignation combined with irritation, I had no choice but to turn my unit off.  *****    So, will I give in to the whim of this reader?  I’ve been thinking about it, been thinking hard about it, in fact.   You see, this certain person sent me a message saying that s/he reads my blog every once in a while. S/he was asking if I could expound on what really happened on my previous entry. The juicy details in other words.  But you see,  that would defeat the whole purpose of this website . This is a medium to express my latest sentiments from my very disorganized mind putting into words the current happenings in my mad existence! Your request is against my style of writing. It would be something planned, some anticipated. Which are total opposites in my terms.  Proposing in a non-offending but still charming way, I’m sad to say that it will not be possible for me to accommodate your request. All entries are encoded straight from recently fresh brain cells. Maybe some other time…   *****  But then again, I’m not that difficult to talk to. You really wanna know what happened? Well, here it goes….  It has been a while since I visited our vast land in a province somewhere North, but not that far from Manila. In this place where I finished my secondary education, I met a lot of faces, got to know different people, but cultivated only a few relationships from them. Nesh, a classmate since gradeschool, was one of them.   Anyway, I loved going home because I get to see my dad, our “asong-ulol” dogs and our backyard pool. This happened around two months ago. Nesh and I got together to do some catching-up. Suddenly, she started crying over this guy, JM, who I still haven’t met. He left my friend because, according to him, she was too good for him. My friend wasn’t convinced. She asked me if I could talk to this JM. Apparently, this guy knows me and keeps telling Nesh that we are friends.  Curiosity seeped in and that ticked me to actually go on with the favor being asked. I got his number and texted him. Surprise, surprise! He turned out to be one of those prank texters who keeps sending me quotes with lewd innuendoes. Immediately, we came to an agreement to meet after I get back from SF (which was last Monday). But before that, JM started calling me every so often and was asking if I would go out with him. I wouldn’t reply as respect to my friend, of course.   However, every text led me closer to what he was like. We both know certain friends. That became a way for me to reply to his persistence. Eventually, we got into talking about our sex lives: what we like, what our partners lack; what we need. Which eventually led to his invitation.   When I got back, I was determined not jump into bed with him. It was, afterall, the very first time we are gonna meet.  But when I saw him, when I saw him, when I saw him….    *****   “Give me chastity and continence, but not yet.”    -- Saint Augustine

       13 days to go!!!!!! Summer Place here I come (again)!   *****  I'm unfair. I just realized that last night. That I'm unfair. I'm unfair to all the guys I've met; I'm unfair to all my boyfriends; I'm unfair to myself.  That after comtemplating long and hard why he is so much different from the way things used to be (even before the Queensland incident).   I'm young. I just entered my 20s. Would I be worth it for him to leave his girlfriend of 5 years? Ask me that two weeks ago and I'll answer you with  "HELL YES!"  But now, I believe that I'm not. I'm too much of a risk. I know myself. When I get bored, when I fall out of love, when I see somebody new, I'll find a flimsy excuse to leave him. He's way past marrying age, while I'm having the time of my life fooling around. It'll be unfair for him.  *****  If I remember it correctly, it was During. I think. The name of the storm that time. We were onboard a plane bound for Caticlan. August 2002. The storm was During. A 12-seater Cebu Pacific full of Koreans with the exception of me and Phillip. We braved the scary weather to finally see Boracay. To see if all the shittalk wasn't just shittalk afterall.   *****  The situation is like this:  This Saturday is her birthday .  And HE is invited . How did I know he was invited to this drinking party? Well, she told me that she invited him. Actually, they have been quite in touch these past few days. She told me. And she is wishing and praying that they get back together.  Will I attend to this pseudo-party that I, myself, organized? I was ready and reeling to go. I already know what I will be wearing. But when I found out he was invited…  My life is too bad to be true. That I can say. Scenarios are playing in my mind on how will I react when see him this Saturday. Will I act like nothing happened between us just last Monday? Will I secretly smile when we pass by each other, knowing we shared something very intimate; more intimate than the two of them had shared? Will I shudder everytime our elbows, hands, arms suddenly brushed? It will be very difficult to behave normally.    I’ll keep remembering the Nestle Yogurt, the way it flowed along untrespassable contours. The shower, where the first kiss happened with the soap, bubbles and all. The bed, how I clung to the headboard for dear life during the countless times you keyed in. How we did it with my back in the mirror.  It was an event worth replaying a thousand times over until I find another adventure to suffice this hunger.    I might not resist when you give me another look. That look which will mean that “ I’m lusting and you’re bordering on lusting, so what the heck are we doing here when we can go someplace where we can surrender ourselves to delirious satisfaction?”  That is one way to put it. What if the look will mean like  “we both know something ensued between us and I don’t care what your friend will think (I don’t love her anyway) just as long as I tell her because she needs to know what a snakelike friend she has in your existence?”  My reputation would send me whirling out of the Squa Friendship circle.  The probing question for the day remained unanswered. I’m dumbfounded as I find myself in the same dilemma that happened just a few months ago. I’m caught between two persons but I don’t wanna get caught. Luckily, I have four more days to decide.  *****   Corporate employee or call-center agent?  I was wrongly labeled to be belonging to either one of these occupations since I kicked my butt out of undergraduate school. It was a source of constant amazement to all (disappointment to my parents) that all my life, I either worked as a honoraria volunteer and an NGO Officer. I graduated with a degree in Broadcasting. What the hell am I doing slaving off in a type of work where there is no pension plan, no over-time pay, minor salary increase, little room for promotions and no other incentives private and GO employees usually get?    I wouldn’t say that it was a calling.  But this is something I really enjoy doing. I do have the option to work in corporate offices in Makati, Ortigas, or Alabang if I put my heart into it. I was actually given the option. After I left my work with the street children last year, I applied for different companies in Makati. I got accepted in 2 multinationals. The pay was twice as much as what I was receiving in my former work. I didn’t tell this to my mother. I was looking for an NGO work. So when I saw the opening for a Public Relations Officer in my current affiliation, I wasn’t hesitant to apply for it. Like any other work, there are days that will kill you, like there is no end with the piles and piles of paperwork on CERs and Impact Evaluation. It is definitely hardwork. Like this article, this is hardwork so I’m gonna stop now.  *****  For Oracle:   "A poet's business is not to save the soul of man, but to make it worth saving."    --- James Elroy Flecker

      Dumarating yung mga pagkakataon na minsan akala mo masaya ka, tapos bigla ka nalang tatahimik kase maaalala mo siya. Maaalala mo yung mga pinagsamahan niyo. Yung mga usual things na ginagawa niya na naging ritwal na sayo. Kase kahit aminin mong tapos na yung yugto ng buhay mo na kunwari hindi mo siya mahal, alam mo, sa puso mo, siya parin ang laman nito. Hindi ka maaaring magkamali.  Minsan iniisip mo kaya ganyan na ang pakikitungo niya sa iyo dahil bumabalik ka na naman sa mga one night stands mo. Ang tanong: alam ba niya ang mga ito? Hindi na siguro maaalis sa iyo yan pero kung hihingin niyang tumigil ka....  alam mo pipilitin mo para sa kanya.   Ganyan mo siya kamahal. Minsan iniisip mo kung bakit kailangan mo pang dumaan sa ganitong pagsubok para lang ma-realize na hindi pala talaga kayo para sa isa't-isa. Siya parin ang mahal niya. At kung ikukumpara ka lang sa kanya, baka mapahiya kapa.  Ang tunay at kumpletong kalungkutan ay nararamdaman mo bago ka matulog sa gabi. Tama ang sinabi ng kapatid mo. Hindi ka makatulog kase parang three weeks ago, hindi ka niya pinapatulog sa kakatelebabad niyo. Umaabot kayo ng alas-kwarto. Paikot-ikot ka sa kama kase hindi ka makatulog sa kakaisip sa kanya. Kung iniisip karin niya. Tatayo ka para nasahin yung libro ni Sionil na sampung beses mo na yata nababasa para makatulog ka. Minsan, bababa kapa para manood ng TV. Minsan kukunin mo yung electric fan kase yung aircon nakakadagdag sa kalungkutan mo. Minsan pagbinuksan mo yung radio, sumasakto ang kanta ni Tamia na Officially Missin' You.... at maiiyak ka kase parang ginawa yung kanta para sa inyong dalawa. Masakit diba?  Kelan kaba huling nagkaganito? Matagal-tagal narin, kay Rhett pa. Matagal na yun ha. Minsan naaawa narin ako sa iyo kase kung anu-anong kagagahan ang pinapasukan mo. Kung tutuusin, marami naman dyan ang may gusto sayo, wala pang sabit. Hindi ko malamam kung bakit sa mga committed kapa nalalaglag.  Minsan nga mag-isip ka. Nakakaawa ka. Magaling kang magmahal, masarap kang magmahal, alam na namin yon. Pero ang tanong:  Nahanap mo na ba ang taong kayang suklian ang pagmamahal mo?    Malamang hindi pa. Kase hindi ka na naman umiimik, nag-iisip ka na naman. Tama na nga iyan. At pwede ba, ibang Sionil na libro naman ang basahin mo?! Wag kang umasang mapapanood mo pa ang School of Rock na kasama siya. Itigil mo na yung palihim mong pagpasok sa YM para tignan kung andun siya! Maawa ka naman sa sarili mo. Hindi naman ito para sa akin eh.... para sa iyo.   (If my conscience could speak....)   *****   I'm lettin go, help me to let go....

       Was it when I was playing with the keys in the keyboard when you suddenly touched my hands, feeling the way I slide my fingers along those cream colored electronic controlled squares that I realized that maybe, just maybe, there is more to this than the foregoing friendship of six years?   Our nicknames spell the same, save for one letter. But that didn't mean that we were, are, meant to belong to this cruel but torelable world? We should have stopped it when we realized what was happening....   Who are you anyway?  You were just the only guy I trust and who knows me inside-out in the barkada. You were the one I turn to when I'm heart-broken, disillusioned, or depressed. You were the guy who will, without qualms, pick-up me up when I'm in need of a ride or when I'm stuck in an unknown spot. You were the guy who scans all my pictures. You were the first guy who carried Ian. You were the guy who had seen me in my naked glory. You were the guy who gives me Icepops when I need cheering up. You were the guy who said that I look beautiful when I'm quiet and thinking, or when I kid around with the guys, or when I'm so angry with all of you that I hurl anything that my hand touches, or when the I'm reading that Tully book you gave me, or when I'm memorizing labor laws, or when I'm behind that candlelight in a Malate diner. I was beautiful in your eyes. But again, you were the guy my neighbors know as my boyfriend. You were the guy who gets angry when I'm wearing revealing clothes. The guy who fights for me when I get agitated and irritated by the other guys. You were the guy who told me that you'll be there even after all the things that I've been through. You were the guy who tells me you love me everytime we part. You even paid two months of my phone bill.  You're THAT guy.    How come I cannot force myself to fall in-love with you? I love you but I'm not in-love with you.    I saw the pain in your eyes when you leaned forward and tried to kiss me but then I turned away.   *****   Jay,  I'm so sorry. Really, I am. I didn't mean it to be this way. Maybe it was my fault. Eventually, I'll have the courage to finish this entry. But for now....

      10 years ago.  Almost 10 years ago. Twas ten years ago since my mom walked in Central Park, my dad carefully drove in Snake Road. The apartment and the dentist clinic in Philadelphia. The flee markets, Macy’s, Thanksgiving, Martha’s Vineyard, Coney Island. That was ten years ago. After that, they went back here in Manila, due to home sickness. Sometimes, I could see my dad’s eyes twinkle every American scene played in cable, terribly missing the place.   Who could blame him?   Recently, the family has been discussing the possibility of migrating to the States. The scenario in not really new. This issue had been discussed a thousand times over holidays, family celabrations, even Sunday dinners. This time around, my grandma (the matriach of the family), laid down her willingness to move permanently in the East Coast of the so-called land of Milk and Honey. And since I’m only just a new member of the Sunday Table Dinner, I had no choice but to hide my grimace over the mechado lola cooked. Her decision was accepted without hesitation from all. Except from my violently reacting mind.  I cannot imagine leaving the country. Not ever. Or maybe not right now. I grew up here! How can I survive without the isaw? The balut? How about the year-round pool parks? Conveniently available sari-sari stores? Ice tubig? My not-even-halfway-thru island hopping? Sunken Garden? Baywalk? My friends? Only a few of them are in US, mostly in the West Coast. The decision was really impossible if the main consideration is my continued survival in this planet.   Well, they could leave me this house....  *****   Dear Bri,   What can I say? Una-unahan nga lang ba? I’ll be once again stepping in the white fine-combed sands, foamy lapping waves of Boracay this weekend. Willy’s Rock, Jonah’s, Station 2, Summer Place, Hey Jude, the Mall. Memories, memories, memories. Early the day, I found myself flipping through the Boracy Photo album. Pictures of you and your model (phew!) poses; the shot wherein you were in the sand, laughiug your head off with this “BRIAN!” joke I kept on repeating (LOL while typing this); La Reserve and that french guy Bernand; the mugged Korean; against all odds swimming in the night; the choco-banana crepe in that barista’s hut; Monica aka Bruno? Hahahahaha. Even with the typhoon, everything was worth the trip.   I remember on our second night when we went dancing in Summer Place and this surfer guy started dancing with me and you immediately cut in. How bout Vlad’s look-alike who had a, ehemm, crush on me?   I was actually having second thoughts whether to tag along in this trip. It would mean betrayal in the spit-compact we made in the place, swearing we are not stepping on that place again unless if we’re together. Should I say sorry? Okay, sorry ka nalang..... hehehehe. But I promise this July, together....  *****  Sige na. Mas excited pa kayo sakin. Sige, kayo magpaparty. Tutal mukang yung mga gusto niyo na naman ang masusunod, tulad last year. Ang hirap kase sa inyo, nagdikit-dikit ang mga beerday ninyo sa buwan ng BER. So ang unang hurrah ng barkada, mangagaling sa akin ngayong July. It’s annoying enough that I’ll be adding another year to my already old, old age. Ayan at may Grand Painom pa!  Para bang hindi pa kayo nagsasawa sa monthly toma sessions natin pang nagkikita-kita tayo, kelan pang isumbat ang birthday ko at bigyan ako ng listahan ng mga tomang dapat present. Nataranta ako bigla bago ko ma-realize na May palang pala. Wala pa ngang kalahati ang May! Hala, anu tong mga nakasulat? Absolut Koran and Raspberry; San Mig Light and Strong Ice; Kahlua; Heineken; Fundador, Red Horse; Colt 45; Tequila; Maria Clara; Red and White Wine.... teka-teka, may-ari ba ako ng isang alcohol distillery at anak ba ako ng isang beer magnate para pag-produce-sin niyo ako ng mga ganio. Okay lang kayo?! Hindi naman kayo mga sunog-bago noh? Napansin ko lang.  Naisip ko tuloy last birthday ko. Masaya naman tayo dun sa San Mig Light at Tequila ah. Ba’t parang ang dami yata ngayon? Tsaka patok yung entertainment natin last year: Videoke; Baraha; Bingo; Charades; Agawan Base; Marathon ng Simpsons. Ayus na yun kung replay. Masyado kayo magastos.    Teka, makapagbudget nga.   *****  It’s not a sexual need. I don’t love him. But I just came into a realization that he is the only guy I imagined waking up to the rest of my life. No questions about that. During the course of our three times sexual stint, I always find myself not sleeping. It was enough for me that I’m laying beside him, touching his right earlobe, seeing him twitch as if he’s dreaming of something bad. It wasn’t love.  But it was contentment . I was contented to be in that way for the rest of my life. Not talking but just sleeping together.   I miss him right now. Miss even how bad he treated me. Somehow, I’ll never grow tired of that, it will be a bad habit I’m looking forward to feeling. Like you.  *****   In the Libre comic strip of Nano Gang today :   I hope that this darkness would end soon…  …so that I could see you again.

       "No happy moment is ever really gone if it leaves a lonely memory."    --- Robin St.John   *****  Sa saliw ng "No Woman, No Cry" ni Marley, nagkakilala tayo. Nasa ikatlong shot na ako ng Silk Panty at bumubwelo para sa straight na Orgasm sa hamon ni Manong Bartender. Umuulan. Sarado ang ibang bars at ang Wave ay may private party. Masyadong malayo ang Mangas sa Station 1 at medyo lahat na yata ng tao sa Summer Place ay kilala ko na. Napagkamalan nga akong naka-Party nung ibang Americans kase sobrang lupit ang hataw ko sa sayaw kagabi. Kaya napatambay ako sa bar ng tito ko. At andun ka, kasama ang bote ng Red Horse, iba mong mga kaibigan, at ang billiard table.  Ilang tinginan na rin ang nagpalitan sa atin bago ka nagkaroon ng lakas ng loob na magpakilala. Okay lang naman. Hindi nagkakalayo ang edad natin at pareho naman tayo nasa mood makipagkwentuhan. San ba tayo nakarating? Sa mga idealisms natin, sa buhay mo, sa buhay ko, sa mga katarantaduhan natin, sa Boracay, kahit yung mga gagong tanong na "If the seal is broken, will you accept it?". Ewan basta ang gaan na talaga ng loob ko sa yo. Hinatid mo pa ako sa cabin ko nung matapos ang kwentuhan ng alas-tres ng umaga. Nakakantiyawan pa nga yung mga barkada mo.  Akala ko hanggang dun nalang. Yung isang usap ng isang gabing walang magawa. Kinabukasan, habang nagpapahenna ako sa likod bigla ka nalang dumating at hinalikan ang pisngi ko.  Close ba tayo?  Pero natuwa ako kase kanina pa talaga kita hinahanap nung nasa Talipapa ako at sa d'Mall. Nakalimutan ko kase kung san ka naka-stay kaya hindi kita ma-hunting at ma-spy on. Kaya nagulat ako. At natuwa. Sabay abot ka sa Watermelon-Mango Shake without milk na kinuwento ka sayo na the best ang lasa. Sabi mo hindi mo type kaya binibigay mo sakin. Ok lang. Kinilig parin ako kase yung effort na subukan mo yung shake na dun ko rin din natikman, tumalon na ang puso ko. Sabi mo astig yung henna ko na spiral backbone sa likod. Sabi mo swerte naman nung nag-hehenna sakin. Charing ka talaga. Kagabi kapa. Ang haba na ng buhok.  Magkasama na tayo buong maghapon. Nakatambay tayo sa cabin ko. Ikaw nagsu-sway ng hammock ko, sinamahan mo akong bumili ng souvenirs, at kahit ayaw mong mag-swimming dahil may sipon at ubo kana kakanight swimming, ikaw nalang yung nagbantay ng sarong ko habang ako'y nagpapakaligaya kasama ang konting lumot at ang maputi at pinong buhangin ng Aklan.  Binilan mo pa nga ako ng isang Pawa Necklace yung may red na string. Kase sabi mo bagay sa kulay ng pisngi ko. Mahal na yata kita. Nung gabi, naglakad tayo sa Cafe del Sol, sabi mo kase may sasabihin ka kaya sumama ako.   Tama ka:  Kung nasa paraiso ka tulad ng Boracay, nakakalimutan mo ang lahat. Nawawala pandalian ang mga problemang laging nandyan kung gigising ka sa isang ordinaryong araw sa Maynila. Na parang lahat pwedeng magyari sa lugar na yon.  Magical  nga, yun ang sabi mo. Sumangayon naman ako sa iyo.    Kase lahat yan nararamdaman ko.   Sabi mo isa akong taong kakaiba. Bihira lang ang mga taong may takbo ng pag-iisip na katulad ko. Na malamang kahit hindi mo hingin ang number ko, gagawa ka ng paraan para mahanap ako. Napangiti lang ako.   Eto na naman...   Hinatid mo ako sa cabin ko sabay halik sakin.  Kung pwede lang talaga,  sabi mo.   Oo nga kung pwede lang. Kaya lang ayoko na maging third party ulit. Parang nakakasawa na. Sabi mo, kung wala lang siya, di imposibleng ako nasa buhay mo nga. Napangiti lang ako sabay pasok sa pinto. Hanggang dito nalang muna siguro. Kung tayo, tayo. Pero hindi nga pwede.    Dahil maputol man ang kamay mo na may singsing na simbolo ng pangako mo, nanjan parin ang alaala ng tanging nilalang na makakaramdam ng habangbuhay sa piling mo.

       Every breath you take Every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I’ll be watching you.     Baka naman ako ang dream girl  mo…    Oh, can’t you see, you belong to me How my poor heart aches, with every step you take   Kakaiba ako    1. Hindi ako high-maintenance –  as a matter of fact, hindi nga ako nagmumuk-ap! Luho na yung maliit na lalagyan ng body shop lip gloss at tapos na. Ang mga damit ko ay ukay-ukay. Yung mga Tommy, Guess, Benetton, Mango na nakikita mong gamit at suot ko, bigay lang lahat yan.    2. Hindi ako mapili sa pagkain  – naku lahat nalang yata kinakain ko. Pati yata penguin kakainin ko para sayo. Kung ang plane nga nating dalawa ay nag-crash, without batting an eyelash, kakainin ko yang mga taba ng puwet mo. Alive ba? Im pak, kung tumatanggap lang ng non-US citizens ang fear factor at survivor at kung kainan lang ng wirdong delicacies ang laban, baka sampung beses na akong nanalo!    3. Marunong ako mag-swimming –  pwede nga akong sumide-line sa pagmumuro-ami sa lalim ng sisid ko. At kung wala lang akong malaking boobs at maliit lang ang balakang ko, malamang ay napasama pa ako sa Olympics. Kung magka-crash man ang plane natin sa tubig, aba! Kayang-kaya itang sagipin. Tuturuan pa kita magswimming. Superwoman na yan ha.    4. Me kasama ka sa inuman.  Ako pa! Sunog-baga nga yata ako. From Gin Bulag to Cali to San Mig Strong Ice to Amaretto 7 to Tequila Sunrise to Tequla Sunset, kakang-kaya kong tungain para sa iyo. Yun ba ang gusto mo? Marunong din akong mag-yosi, di nga lang ako marunong gumawa ng bilog na usok pero pag-aaralan ko yan para sa iyo.   5. Maganda naman ako  – sabi nga nila kamuka ko raw si Judy Ann, si Kelly Osbourne, si Betty Boop, si Dominic Ochoa, si Jordan Herrera…kung sino-sino pa! Malaki nga lang balakang ko pero pwede na siguro. Hindi naman ako nakakahiyang ipakilala bilang SO mo.   6. Music lover naman ako  – Lahat na yata ng uri ng musika ay alam ko. Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Matt Moroe, Tom Jones, Eraserheads, Parokya ni Edgar, Bob Marley, The Wallflowers, The Cure, Peter Paul and Mary, Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Michael V., Andrew E., Adam Sandler, Voices of Theory, Oasis, U2, The Police, Rod Stewart, Supergrass, Rizal Underground, Salbakuta, kahit ang Jaboom Twins alam  ko ang kanta yung  "Sumusunod sa galaw mo, sumusunod sa galaw mo..."  Soundtrip pa tayo buong araw okay lang, gagawin ko yan.   7. Matalino naman ako –  siguro, matalino ako. Sabi nila weird daw yung pagkatalino ko. Sabi nga ng barkada ko, meron daw akong contingency brain: kaya kong mag-isip ng mga solusyon sa mga kumplikadong sitwasyon na baliw lang talaga ang makakaisip. Pero epektib naman. Tsaka marami narin akong nabasang mga libro, from Bob Ong to John Steinbeck pwede ako, samahan mo pa ng Mario Puzo. Kahit Xerex at latest printed offense ng Toro, alam ko.    Anu pa naman ang hihilingin mo? Dream girl na dream girl diba?  Eh, ako kaya kelan ko mahahanap dream girl ko?    Ay, nadulas!

       Dear A1,   Pasensya kana na text kita kanina ha. Binabasa ko kase yung mga letters na binigay mo sakin nun eh. Parang apat na taon din yung napunta sa wala. Nagsimula tayo bilang magkaibigan, ngayon, parang hindi na nga tayo magkakilala. Siguro busy ka sa kanya. Okay lang naman sakin yun eh. Alam ko. Kase dati, sa akin ka busy.   Tinatanong ko nga sarili ko bakit ko pa tinatago lahat ng mga sulat mo eh. Nandun lahat ng mga pangako mo. Yung forever na sinabi mo. Pero ngayon, isang minuto lang.... Sandali lang ha, naiiyak ako. Naaalala na naman kase kita. Naaalala mo pa ba nung kasama kita sa car ni Jake nung hahatid niya ako sa bahay nung nanliligaw pa siya? Bestfriend palang kita nun pero alam ko, naramdaman ko, yung mga tingin mo, na sobrang selos ka. Tapos nun, naging tayo.  Ang dami narin nating pinagdaanan. Malayo ka palang, alam ko nandyan kana. Konti lang naman kase ang nagbi-bike pumasok sa Ateneo. Yung laptop mo na lagi mong dinadala sa loob ng campus kase unlimited internet access. Yung condo. Yung bank account natin na malapit na ipaghiwalay ngayon. Yung mga pictures natin sa digicam ko. Diba nagpaparamihan pa nga tayo ng friends nun sa friendster? Isang malungkot na ngiti nalang ang nakikita ko sa salamin pag tinitignan ko sarili ko tuwing naaalala kita.  Siguro nga hindi ako para sayo. Masyado ka kasing mabait, masyado kang perpekto, parang hindi na kita maabot. Nung hindi pa tayo gumagradweyt, iisa lang ang pangarap natin pareho. Pero pagkatapos nun, marami kang hinanap, maraming kang iniba;  at kasama ako na may kapalit sa puso mo.   Hindi ko lang inaasahan na ipagpapalit mo ako.Mahalin ka sana niya tulad ng pagmamahal na ginawa ko at patuloy kong ginagawa. Kung tutuusin, something good came out of this:  one of your dreams came true . Diba college palang tayo ay gustong-gusto mo na siya? Masaya ako para sayo. Huwag kang mag-alala sakin. Okay lang ako. Kuntento na akong makita na may ibang aura ang taong dating nagmamahal sakin. Siguro kayo nga talaga.   Tama lang ang apat na taon nating pinagsamahan. Nakilala natin ang isa't-isang mabuti.  Those were the happiest moments in my life . At kung bibigyan ako ng pagkakataon na papiliin kung gusto kong daanan lahat ng pinagdaan ko makapiling ka lang, kahit sampung beses pa. Ganyan eh, parte kana talaga. Swerte lahat ng taong mamahalin mo. Mapalad ako na naging ako yun kahit minsan.  Ayoko na ngang umuwi ng bahay kase lahat ng nakikita ko sa kwarto ko, halos lahat galing sa iyo. Pati pa yung ibang bigay mo sa mga kapatid ko at mga parents ko. Yung mga korni mong texts, buburahin ko ba? Minsan nga sinasanay ko nan pumirma na gamit ang apelido mo.   Ayokong tapusin ito. Kase pagtinapos ko ito, parang tinapos ko narin ang mga alaala nating dalawa. Bibigay mo na sakin yun. Yun nalang ang thank you mo sa mga bagay na....    (For Cla, I feel for you...Honestly)    *****   Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all when in the end, you have lost everything?

       “Madam, kahit nakahubad na kayo, para parin kayong nakadamit.”   This was the comment of the masseuse attending at me in a spa somewhere in Shaw. I was there last Saturday getting a full-body massage for 200 bucks that I wasn’t able to get in Boracay. Throw in a couple of hundred more and you’ll also get to experience the soothing world of acupuncture. However, I decided to settle for the former since I have this fear of needles after the blood transfusion I had three months ago without IV. Imagine pure blood running from a cold bag though your veins, without a dextrose to lessen the pain.   Anyway, it was just the massage I was looking forward since I came back from Visayas last Tuesday afternoon. To think one of objectives in going to the beach haven is to get a good backrub. The lady really got my sore spots, and for the first time since I arrived in Manila from this long pending vacation, I was able to sleep two hours straight.  It’s funny looking at my skin tone right now. There is a break of a skimpy bikini bra in my bust area and an obvious hint that I was wearing shorts all along. I also requested that she try to erase the henna in my back since it will attending this formal event and I will be wearing a backless dress for that evening. Going back, I never had this type of skin tone before. I’m like a walking, glistening firewood. Up until now, my sunburn is yet to peel. Actually, it’s a tan, not a sunburn. The difference is that sunburn is actual damage to the skin while tan is affects the outer skin and the melanin composition. Maybe it’s a tan. But I don’t usually get a tan. Typically, three days after every summer swim, I’m like a snake shedding skin.   This time around, I wasn’t.   My family was surprised that my dark tone is taking its time in staying. My friends christened me with another nickname: from the old Matet (I kept constantly making this Halimaw sa Banga jokes) to Neg-Neg. Talk about discrimination, my friends are really walking contradictions coming from a socialist setting. My skin tone is not that of a problem. In fact, I’m getting a lot of compliments how it suits me. But then again, the color of my clothes goes well with fair-skin. So how am I gonna get through this dilemma?  Who cares?! My fashion style wasn’t dictated by anyone I idolize or I know before, so why should I be concerned now?! Might as well wear that hideous dress I was forced to don for the debut of a certain friend.  *****  During my four days, three nights stay in one of the best beaches in the world, I got to meet different set of personalities that I know would tide me with laughter and lonely reminiscing moments for a few more months. With all of the friendly people I’ve met, the following are my personal favorites;   1.  Martilyo Boys  – We were in Wave dancing our hearts out with this song going like “I’m a gigolo spending lots of dough…”  When these three guys tried penetrating our dancing group, one of them immediately went behind my back and started dancing on me. Common guys, use your imagination. My friend shouted something like ‘Minamartilyo kana niyan ha!” We transferred to Summer Place and surprise, surprise! They were there already. We got to know each other and found ourselves hanging out with them the following morning, building a sand castle. They all are working in Ortigas and were classmates in UST. We had fun since they were flirty and they shared the passion of running after swelling waves and jumping on them. Last time I saw them was in the airport. Their flight got cancelled the previous day and they were stranded.   2.  Foreign Bodies – Seen a cabaret dance? Combined with hiphop moves equals to my movement that night. I was really crazy, considering I had just only taken 2 swigs of San Mig Superdry. An Australian and I think an Israeli girl came up to me and asked if I have anymore Party Drug left. Like duh?! Party Drug? I’m having a hard time swallowing aspilet and now you’re asking me if I had taken any ecstasy? Hello? I had to try hard to stifle the snort already bursting to crack.  The following day, I saw these girls in d’Mall and they waved so I had to wave back. Great girls. (It’s raining sarcasm here).   3.  Highschool Boys  – four 16 year old rich kids occupying the hut opposite ours. One took a picture of me when I was braless when my friend was flirting with them. Kids nowadays are so unbelievable! They were drinking redhorse and owned fones that costs my whole Master’s tuition and had expressions like ‘Steady Lang’ or ‘Tripping’. Labo talaga. I really felt my age when I was talking to them. They were quite surprised when they realized they were flirting with someone as old as their fathers’ mistresses (Charing Lang!).  But it was an event worth remembering since I was able to learn a bit of billiards, known the latest teenage craze (I really miss those days), and got to add additional personalities in my friendster! Huwaw! Deep!   4.  Gurlilettes –  sisters of the highschool boys, they are really not the worth space. But they really look beautiful during the night, with all the porma. Don’t ask me during the mornings.   5.  Boga Boys –  Made them run for their money since I get to drink all the Coconut Killers that I want, and these guys challenging me to a patumbahan drinking spree, they eventually gave up when they realized they won’t be able to beat me. A shot costs 90 bucks. I was on my fifth and it was for free. They were nearing but splurging 500 bucks for a single type of drink isn’t practical. So they gave up and we finished the night with Lucky’s Menthol.   A Coconut Killer is a straight shot of rum, tequila, brandy, Malibu and a special ingredient which gives a sweet Coconut aftertaste. Warning: don’t dare standing up after three shots or you’ll be kissing the floor afterwards.   6. Kiteskiing Boy –  he just took my breath, skiing in the hurtful waves, rain beating hard against his skin. I was watching all along while he was there, making love with the waves. I was oblivious of the weather, that I was also getting wet and that seafoam is creeping up inside my shorts. I was gaping at him: every spin and turn and flip and airborne maneuvers. I was awed, amazed smittened, in-love, envious, jealous and hurting all at the same time.  When he went back to shore, I was surprised to see that he was one of the guys I was drinking with last night. He smiled and rushed to me. I can’t look up because it was raining. But I knew right then and there that I was again falling it the of those forlorn souls who had nothing better to do but to hurt themselves in the process of getting to know this special person when likely in the end they’ll probably wanna forget everything like it was all a bad dream, similar to a stolen mobile fone.  But I think I’ve already said too much about him in a previous entry.  *****   I bet you didn’t know this….   When we first met, when we first did it, when we first kissed, you took my heart with you. Every inch, every ounce and every essence of my being was suddenly pawned for your keeping.   It was more than I wanted, and I felt that I didn’t deserve you. You don’t deserve someone as low as me. But what we felt at that time was able to transcend what initially was the hindrance. And it didn’t matter that you were with her, that I was like this, what we want was right there.  *****  Tama na siguro na pinagbigyan kita kahapon. Birthday mo naman eh. Parang last hurrah na ng pinagsamahan natin. Nagulat nga ako sa request mo na kung pwede dun ako matulog sa inyo, malungkot ka lang sobra sa birthday mo. Kaya pumunta ako.  Sakto nga naman na walang tao sa inyo. Pero nung sinalubong mo ako sa gate, nakita ko na na iba ang dating mo, matamlay na matamlay. Pagbukas mo ng gate, wala kang nagawa kundi ng lumuhod sa harap ko para umiyak. Sabi mo nagsisisi ka sa ginawa mo. Wag mo ako luhuran, hindi ako karapat-dapat sa mga tangis mo. Tumayo ka at niyakap ako, humihingi ng tawad.  Ano nga ba naman ang gusto mong gawin ko? Magpakagaga ulit sayo? Nung minahal kita, alam ko, ikaw na yung taong higit na sa pwede nang mga nakikilala ko. Na kaya kong isuko kahit ano man ang prinsipyo ko para sayo, na gagawin kong lahat pati na ang lumipad mahalin mo man lang ako tulad ng pagmamahal ko sayo. Lahat sinubukan ko para sa iyo. Minahal ko yang lecheng team ng Ginebrang yan kahit tang na hindi ako mahilig sa basketball. Pinapanood kita sa mga games mo kahit alam mo na may mga exams ako. Hindi ako nakakatanggi kung inaalok mo ako ng beer, ikaw nga nagturo sakin uminom. Kahit gusto kong sumama sa Tagaytay nun dahil anniversary ng parents ko, sinamahan kita kase sabi mo depressed ka dahil parang hindi mo ma-achieve yung mga goals mo sa buhay, na tipong parang wala kang kwentang tao. Andun ako para sabihin na nagkakamali ka, na isipin mo nalang kung  ANO AKO KUNG WALA KA SA BUHAY KO . Anjan ako kapag may sakit ka, kapag wala kang kasama, kapag kailangan mo ng tutor, kapag wala kang pera, kapag inaaway ka ng mga kapatid mo, kapag pinapalayas kana ng mga magulang mo, kapag gusto mo ng sex, kapag gusto mo lang may masigawan at masaktan dahil sa sama ng loob mo.  Pero hindi mo ba alam, pagdating sa akin niyang mga yan, doble ang balik sa akin. Mga problema mo, kargo pa ng responsibilidad ng mangyayari sa iyo kapag iniwan kita, pati narin ng panghihinayang sa mga pinagsamahan natin.  Wala akong nagawa kundi ang damayan ka.    Totoo na kapag nagmamahal ka, nagiging tanga ka. Naramdaman ko yan sayo. Na kahit pigang piga na ako, na wala na talaga akong matakbuhan, na minsan gusto ko nang sumuko, wala akong ibang gagawin kundi ang bumalik sa iyo at sabihing kakayanin natin ang mga ito.  Na kakayanin ko ito para sa iyo.   Pero anong ginawa mo? Halata ba na gusto mong makipaghiwalay sa akin? Makikipagdate ka lang, dun pa sa alam mong lagi kong pinupuntahan sa araw na iyon. Marami naman ibang kapihan, ba’t kailangan dun pa? Nagpaalam pa nga ako sa iyo nung umagang yon. Kailangan ba na mag-pretend ka na hindi mo ako kilala nung dumaan ako sa table niyo na alam ko naman nakita mo ako? Pero pinatawad kita pagkatapos nun. Kahit sabi pa ng mga kaibigan ko na nakikita ka nila na may kasamang iba-ibang babae. Okay lang.  Hangga’t hindi ko mismo nakikita, wala akong dapat ipagalala.   Tadhana narin siguro ang nagsadya na makita kong hinahalikan mo siya bago siya bumaba sa taxi sa Main Lib. Yun nalang siguro ang kailangan ko. Wala na akong lakas para magalit o magwala kase pagod na pagod na ako. Wala rin naming patutunguhan diba? Ayoko na ginanawang tanga at ayoko na magpakatanga. Hindi na kita hinarap. Nawala nalang ako bigla sa buhay mo. Buti nalang ay gagraduate na ako. Hindi na kita makikita. Hindi mo na ako masasaktan, na sabi mo hindi mo alam na nagagawa mo. Iniba ko pati number ko. Bumalik ako sa lola ko para hindi mo na ako masundan. Tama na siguro na iniwan mo akong sugatan.  Tapos bigla kita ulit nakita nung pagpasok ng taon. Ibang-iba kana. Na parang kaya mo nang tumanggap ng responsibilidad sa buhay. Nagulat ka nung makita ako. Hindi ka makapaniwala. Kung hindi pa kita nilapitan, hindi mo siguro ako papansinin, sabi mo. Pero anong magagawa ko? Kung pwede ko lang sunugin yung lugar, sinunog ko para isiping ang lahat ay pawing masamang panaginip. Pero nanjan ka sa harap ko: totoo at humihinga.  Kahapon, nung sinamahan kita. Nung umiyak ka ng todo sa harapan ko at sinasabing pagbigyan ulit kita kahit isang beses pa, na nagbago ka na at kayang patunayan yun ng lahat ng tao sa paligid mo, wala nang epekto sakin. Kase pinatay mo na ako. Wala na akong abilidad na maintindihan ang mga sinasabi mo dahil lason na lahat ang lumalabas sa bibig mo. Dahil sa iyo, nawlan ako ng tiwala sa tao, ang lahat ng lalake ay sex lang ang gusto. Na wala akong kwentang tao dahil hindi kita naisalba.  Hindi pala ako Diyos para gawin yon. Ang pilitin kong tulungan ka. Dahil nahirapan ako dahil sa akin mo pinatong ang responsibilidad. Pero pano ko nga ba naman tutulungan ang taong ayaw tulungan ang sarili niya? Hindi ko kayang maging malakas para sa ating dalawa; kahit sarili mo nalang isipin mo, okay na ako.  Kaya nung iniwan kita kaninang madaling araw, wala akong nagawa kundi maiyak. Kase kahit anong sakit ang binigay mo sa akin, alam ko na isa sa misyon ng buhay nating dalawa ang paligayahin ang isa't-isa.... sa kahit anong paraan.  Binigo ko sila.   Dahil hindi ko nakikitang magiging masaya ako kung laging buntot ang anino ng mga alaala mo.

       Leo,    Kagabi pagkatapos kong madisconnect sa net, naalala na naman kita. Mag-aanim na taon na mula nung huli kitang nakita at nakausap pero parang nanjan ka lang sa harap ko, pwede kong hawakan at yakapin tulad ng ginagawa ko dati.   Minsan iniisip ko kung hindi ba tayo ngakahiwalay, tayo parin ba ngayon? Bata pa tayo nun pero ang saya-saya natin. Sabi nga nila,  may isang taong sadyang ginawa lamang para makapiling mo habang buhay.  At ikaw ang taong yon. Dahil sa iyo, namulat ako sa katotohanang na maari palang isipin ko lang ang kapakanan ng isang tao, na mawawala ang pagiging self-centered ko. Lahat gusto kong ibigay sa iyo. Kungsabagay, hindi naman talaga naging tayo. Walang pormal pagkakataon na ibinigay ko sa iyo ang OO ko. Hindi na kase kailangan nun eh. Bakit pa natin bibigyan ng tawag ang isang pangyayaring alam natin na talagang tadhanang maganap? Simula nang magkakilala tayo, hindi na nila tayo mapaghiwalay.  Ngunit lahat ayaw sa nangyayari. Papasok palang ako sa UP, ikaw hindi kana magco-college pero pagpaptuloy mo nalang ang negosyo ng tatay mo. Sabi nila wala raw akong mapapala sa iyo, na maghanap daw ako ng ka lebel ko. Sabi nila sa iyo, iiwanan kita pagkagraduate ko. Tignan mo, bata palang tayo nun pero nakita na nila ang kaseryosohang bumabalot sa ating pagsasama. Kaya nagkaroon ako bigla ng curfew; ikaw naman ay balak na pauwiin sa Batangas. Mahahadlangan pa kaya nila tayo?  Pagkatapos ng pagtuturo mo sa akin ng basic Nihonngo? Pagkatapos mo ako bigyan ng first kiss ko? Pagkatapos ng pagtakas natin nung pumunta tayo sa Baguio? Pagkatapos nung samahan mo ako nung first month ko sa UP, kahit nanjan ka lang sa tabi naghihintay? Pagkatapos nung mahuli tayo ng kapatid mo sa SM papasok  at manood ng sine? Pagkatapos nating planuhin kung ano ang mga pangarap natin sa buhay, ang negosyo natin ng bar, pati mga pangalan ng anak natin at kung saan sila mag-aaral? Nangako tayo na pagkatapos ng pitong taon ay dadalin mo ako sa Paris. Kahit anong pilit pa ang gawin ko, hindi na pwedeng mangyari ang mga yan.  Pumapalagay ang kalooban ko kung naiisip ko nasa mas mabuti kang lugar kaysa sa kinalalagyan mo noong tayo magkasama. Dapat lang na nanjan ka. Sapat na ang paghihirap na dinaanan mo. Pero dahil sa mga iyon, naging matatag ka; at ako kasama mo sa pagiging matatag mo.   Akala ko kase iniwan mo ako, na sumunod kana sa gusto ng pamilya mo. Alam mo ba na ayoko na mag-aral pagkatapos nun? Na walang kwenta ang lahat dahil nawalan ako ng direksyon dahil nawala ka? Mababaliw na yata ako nun. Buti nalang sinabi sa akin ni Bien ang lahat-lahat.  Patawarin mo ako nung nakapagsabi ako sa iyo ng mga masasamang salita, hindi ko sinasadya dahil hindi ko naman alam ang nangyari. Nung sunugin ko ang mga sulat mo, pati narin ang yung tulang ginawa mo nung naramdaman mong mahal mo na pala ako. Patawarin mo ako. Na kulang nalang ay sunugin ko pati kaluluwa mo sa galit ko sa iyo.  Lahat ng mga yan ay may kasamang pagsisisi.    Nasabi ko ba sa iyo kung gaano ka ka importante sa buhay ko? Na dahil sa pagtuturo mo ng Nihonggo gusto ko na tuloy ituloy ang Linguistics? Na pinaframe ko yung tula mo? Na yung original nun nasa wallet ko? Na pagnakikita kita naiiyak ako kase hindi ko akalaing makakapagmahal ako ng tao na higit pa sa sarili ko? Na kapag niyayakap mo ako, parang ayoko na umalis sa mga bisig mo kase alam ko, kahit walang pali-paliwanag, naduon ang kaligayahan ng buhay ko? Na kapag nakikita kitang nasasaktan dahil gusto tayong paghiwalayin, gusto ko nang mamatay dahil ayokong nakikita kang nasasaktan, lalo na ng mga taong dapat na nakakaintindi sa iyo? Na hindi ako nababaduyan nung sabihin mong themesong natin yung ‘All My Life’ ni KC and Jojo kahit na ang sabi ko ay punong-puno ka ng kaewanan? Na alam ko nasaktan kita nung sinapak kita sa galit ko sa iyo nung nalaman kong nakipagkita ka dun sa x mo para ibalik ang mga bigay niya? Na bawat salita mo, bawat aksyon mo, bawat pikit ng mata at emosyon na lumalabas sayo, alam ko dahil yon ang kinabubuhay ko?   Ngayon alam mo na.    Pero may silbi paba ang lahat ngayong wala kana? Na kinuha na Niya?   Humihingi ako ng tawad kase hindi na kita nabibisita. Pagkatapos ng unang dalaw ko sa iyo, hindi na nasundan pa. Sana kahit sa panaginip, magkita tayo. Ang dami kong ikukwento sa iyo. Baka nga batukan mo pa ako.  Pano, hanggang dito nalang siguro. Naiiyak na naman ako; taon narin nung huli kitang maalala. Maligaya kana, at ako, ayun, tinatahak na sana ang daan ay patungo sa kaligayahan.   Huwag kang mag-alala, pupunta ako ng Paris para tuparin ang pangarap mo. Makikita mo ang kagandahan ng lugar na ito sa pamamagitan ng mata ko.   Salamat sa lahat, sa pagpapakilala ng buhay sa akin. Tandaan mo ang bulaklak sa kamay; alam mo na yun, tanging sikretong unang namagitan sa ating dalawa.  *****    In Memoriam     Leo Orencia  August 15, 1980 – June 25, 1998

      Wearing her loose maong blouse and maroon skirt, the girl walked in the library. She was wearing earrings on the secondary holes of each lobe, two silver bangles and once necklace with a red string given to her by a lover stranger when she went to seek the sun more than a week ago.  The weather was gloomy and there was a drizzle of the deities’ tears in her shoulders. But that didn’t hinder her from strutting with confidence and  a purpose inside the bound-and-written packed location. She sat down in a long table opposite the pony-tailed lad. The latter immediately looked up to view the intruder of his lonely existence.  And there she was! Heart beating suddenly fast and loud, he tried stealing glances of the girl. Eyes on the chinky side, lips red without lipstick with the lower lip being bitten, a bit of tan in her cheeks, button but chiseled nose, and her short, wavy hair put in place by a blue rubber headband, she was in full concentration of the bundles of creased paper she kept on shuffling since she started her habitation in the house of intellect a few minutes ago.   Excuse me miss, but do I know you?   The girl gave the guy a confused look.  “Ah…come again?”    Boobsie?     Huh?    It’s me, Eric. Eric Fernandez.    Uhmm, no you must have mistaken me for someone.   With a bit a rush, the girl suddenly stood up with a worried expression on her face.  The past should not haunt her anymore.  *****  Hindi ko iniexpect na ibigay mo sa akin ang lahat-lahat. Kase kung iniexpect mo nagagawin ko lahat ng mga ginagawa mo para sa akin...     MAG-ISIP KA  ...  I'll give you one minute and forty five years.

      Nakakainis. Leading kasi yung sig mo. Tapos yung mga hirit mo na I think that you're actually, really, (whatever!) hitting on me. Hindi pwede. Hindi na pwede. Hindi kaba nagbabasa ng testis ko sa Friendster? I'm always, always the third party. And in your case, (and if you persist with your hirits) I might actually be one again. Bad yun, alam mo ba yun?  This isn't supposed to be happening because we had already transcended the border of attraction even way before our heated debate about our presidential bets for the recent carnival party.   Not again....  *****  Exact thing my boss in my other work said:   "(My Surname)! Are you fucking crazy?! Hindi nga pwede to kase wholesome ang image ni (teenstar)! Pohtah ka, palitan mo yan ah kundi papaarte ko yan lahat sayo sa harap ng starquestors! Sicko...."     *****   Haberdei Ian!   *****   Uy, love is in the air

        Make the most out of everything.    Words I've been living by these past few days. Positive, yes. Dark, very. I have to extort on everything that I have because I have no other choice but to live with it. Happy, never. Accumulation of corrugated braincells, as a friend would put it. Don't ask. I myself can't even understand anything he says. He just loves to draw and he drew Boracay for me like like he was just watching the sunset on the shore. Guilt striken, I contemplated why I'm complaining about my life and my problems which I thought are not that simple but quite obviously, they are, very. I have a simple life. But I'm the one making it complicated. Hell, there's no friggin' reason why one should walk this forsaken existence when you lead a routinary solitude. Head on the floor, I kept on banging until I heard my cousin coming. And stopped. And seated upright. And tried reading that Kundera book for the nth time. I cannot remember the last time I was this neurotic. JS maybe. So long ago. Hafta leave everything behind. Leave all attachments. Kinda like the e-mail. Then again, why do I hafta tolerate this madness? I could just pop a pill, the whole bottle and wait till my heart stops beating and my nerves harden. Musings, musings, bitching. Popularity is outta the question since I was born in the spotlight. The FX earlier the morning was moving in a fast but steady pace. When I passed by Quezon Bridge, I knew that I had entered my world. Repeated world. And I have nothing but the memory and the tears to accompany me.  *****  Bwiset. Nakakainis. Sa totoo lang. Naniwala talaga ako. Dun sa sinabi mo? Remember? Na isa ako sa pinakamaganda. Pinakamagandang babaeng nakita mo? Shet. Compliment. Totoo lang. Naniniwala ako kapag galing sa inyo. Sa mga babae. Ang ganung comment. Diba? Kung sa lalake. Hay naku. Gudlak! Wala. Bola. Sobra. Halatang-halata. Pa-cute lang nila. Kakainis din minsan. Kaka-blush din minsan. Pero iba. Nung sinabi mo yun kanina. Parang at last. Isang taong nauto ng panlabas na kaanyuan. Ok lang. Ayus nga eh. Mega blush ako inside. Outside deadma. Kase hindi ako sanay. Kung galing sa babae. Parang yun na yata. Isa sa mga pinakamagandang bagay na narinig ko tungkol sakin. Humaba. Hair na maikli. Sana. Walang lokohan. Sana.

       "We all come in from the cold We come down from the wire and everybody warms themselves to a different fire..."   The sig of this particular person I know from peyups. So apt for everyone.  *****  For the first time since like a few years ago, I saw myself crying again. I was watching myself in the mirror, my eyes squinting with anguish and pain until all the bearings in my heart materialized to tears. I've never felt this sad before, not even when they told me that he left me, he left us, for good. I was reading the testimonials my friends conjured for my friendster account when I suddenly broke down.   It was different. And weird. And different.   I felt like my soul is trying to escape my body and that I have no recourse but to (eventually) let it go. My body and my soul are two separate entities. But unlike the latter, my body cannot function without my soul. My soul is my torture chamber for everything that I've been doing in this physical existence. It's a storage box for my mistakes. It accounts all my wrong doings. And my body seems to be more than happy to see that everything is accumulating, waiting to explode.  On the other hand, my brain, my mind, is quite nebulous. 360 degree turns every so often, both body and soul cannot cope up. So the two of them, instead of conspiring with the thinktankers, decided to do away with their own.   At best, what I have right now is harmony in disharmony.    But it still brought me to tears knowing that all of them took control of me. And I have no choice but to watch them slowly kill me....  with ultimate, sick pleasure.   *****  Thank you nga pala kagabi ha. At least may isang taong kayang sakyan ang topak ko lately. Kahit gabi na, sinamahan mo parin ako sa bus station at sinubukang piliting wag na naman sumakay ng bus na hindi ko alam kung san ang patutunguhan. Parang ganyan na kase ang buhay ko lately. Lalo na nung na-realize ko na off-target ako sa goals ko. Na kung hindi ako makakapili nga area of specialization sa Master's ko eh mabuti pang itigil ko na ang kahibangan ng pag-aaral muli. Na kung hindi pa ako magsisimulang mag-ipon, malabong makakuha ako ng diver's license by next year. Na kung patuloy kong mamahalin ang trabaho ko ngayon, malamang mawala yung misyon ko na tumulong sa mga batang lansangan at ang dream job ko sa ILO-IPEC, dahil mas pinili ko ang budding entrepreneurs ng bansa. Na kung iisipin ko lagi siya, malamang tuluyan na akong mabaliw dahil aminin mo na na wala talaga kaming patutunguhan.  Kaya nga nagpapasalamat ako. Nagkaron ako ng grounding nung kasama kita. Salamat ha. Kahit minsan ako ang nagsisimula ng pang-iinis sa iyo na ikaw ay isang kalaryot sa tropa. Kahit madalas ay hindi ako nagrereply sa mga text mo at bihira dumating sa yaya mo sa bahay mo kung may inuman o simpleng kwentuhan. Kahit hindi ko pa nababalik yung libro mong The Hobbit kase talagang hindi ko kayang simulan pero promise sisimulan ko na next month. Kahit nakalimutan kitang bigyan ng gift nung Christmas dahil sa dami ng iniisip ko. Kahit puro katarantaduhan ang mga pinagsasasabi ko kung lasing ako.    Sa sobrang kahit diko na matapos ang pagtethank you ko sayo....

      I'm biting my finger while putting this blog into an entry.  Today had been one of the worst days of my life and I dunno why I'm not doing anything to end this misery . There are so many things to consider and in the end, it all boils down on what would make me happy. My mom recently asked when do I plan to get married. I think she's still shocked when I finally mustered enough hoopla to tell her that I don't plan to tie the yellow ribbon down the old oak tree.   Marriage might bring me satisfaction, but not happiness.   Exactly what I told her. She was dumbfounded. Still, her reaction did not move me to apologize and tell her that her eldest daughter will be walking down the aisle and be bearing bouncy babies anytime soon because I would just shatter her illusions (delusions if you ask me).  My friend asked if I enjoy torturing people around me. Why I don't open up and push away those persons who love me. It's just fair. Why would I dare share and let up to anyone when they really don't know what I'm feeling? It's not symphathy, not even emphathy.  But apathy . That's right, apathy. They feel sorry for me because they don't wanna be experiencing the same situation. And who could blame them? The pain I've been through in this 22 years of existence in this lifetime is enough for a dozen people, all past the age of forty. And I'm still standing. That's something I'm proud of. The reason why I'm not opening to anyone is that simply because they can't relate. And they will never understand because they haven't been there. No matter how hard they try to, and how hard I let them learn to, no one will ever get to know what I'm feeling.  Happiness is floating around me but I don't want it.  Let sadness engulf me . And I wanna go back to UP and walk down Sunken, letting the light rain sink down my skin.   I'm crying right now because I have this inner conflict. What I've been doing lately are so against in what I believe in.  Basked sunlight.  Lemme sleep in sweet yellow slumber even for just a while....   *****   "Yoshimi, they don't believe me.

      Nung makita kitang kasama na mo  siya  nung birthday mo last Saturday, alam ko na  I passed on the chance to have you in my life.  Kung tutuusin, dumating ang pagkakataong hiningi mong maging parte ng buhay ko. Pero hindi talaga pwede. Magkaibigan tayo at bawal sa barkada yun. Marami tayong mga taong sasagasaan at taong sasaktan. Tama na siguro yung tayong dalawa nalang ang magtiis kesa magkawatak-watak ang pagkakaibigang matagal nang nabuo at patuloy na nagiging matatag.  Pero nung nakaraan sabado nga, hindi ko lubos maiisip kung bakit kailangan isampal sa akin ang katotohanang nagiging masaya ang mga taong nagmamahal sa akin ng lubusan....  hindi nga lamang sa piling ko.  Pinilit kong ngumiti at maging masaya buong gabi kase birthday mo. First time kong umattend ng birthday mo. At ito pa ang masasaksihan ko.  Kung sabagay, maganda naman siya. Cute. Makinis. Maputi. Tsaka pa-girl. Yun yung importante sayo diba? Dapat ang babae ay parang laging damsel in distress. Yun ang bagay na hinihingi mo sa akin. Pero shempre, hindi pwede. Barako kayong mga kasama ko, why expect me to act differently? Definitely hindi pwede.  Pinana ang puso ko nung pumasok ako sa salas mo na eksatong nagbubulungan kayo. Alam mo yun? Yung tipong pangpelikulang eksena? Tang na, ang corni nga eh. Pero wala naman akong nagawa. Kinalabit ako ni Ron para pumasok at i-greet ka sa masayang araw mo na ito. Tapos nung kumakain na, siya yung kinunan mo ng pagkain. Eh ako lang yata yung ginagawan mo niyan ah. Nung pinakilala mo ako, parang in-passing lang, na parang hindi ka nain-love sa akin.  Pohtah! Alam mo ba nung kabulungan mo yung babaeng yun, gusto ko isang sugurin at sabihing  "Gaga kaba? Ako mahal niyan noh! Panakip butas ka lang! Pinapaselos lang niya ako!"  Tapos nung kinunan mo siya ng pagkain, gusto kong kunin yung plato at ingudngud yung mukha niya dun. Nung pinakilala mo siya, gusto ko siyang tarayan at sabihin na wala siyang karapatan na hawakan ang kamay mo dahil ako lang, AKO LANG, ang tugma kung kayakap ng palad mo ang palad ko? Alam mo ba yun?   Pero hindi ko ginawa. Kase pagkapasok ko palang, nung nakita kong binubulungan mo siya, nakita ko Jake, nakita ko, yung isang uri ng kinang sa mata mo nakikita ko nun pagtinitignan mo ako. Kapag sinasabi mong mahal mo ako at hindi mo alam kung bakit o paano o kung kelan hihinto ito. Basta ang alam mo, bawat paggising mo sa umaga, ako agad ang laman ng isip mo. Na kahit sa simpleng pag-inom mo ng tubig, mukha ko ang lumalabas sa guni-guni mo. Kakaiba ang nararamdaman mo. Magaan sa puso. At parang pagmagkasama tayo, gusto mong tumigil ang pag-ikot ng mundo.  Kaya nga nung nakita ko ulit yung kakarampot na saya sa mata mo nung gabing yun, hindi ko maipagkakait ang bagay na yon na makakapagpaligaya sa iyo. Na makakapagpalaya sa iyo. Kase alam ko kung ano ang hirap na pinagdaanan mo para lang pigilan ang nararamdaman mo. Sabi ko naman sayo yun diba? Na makakahanap ka ng iba ng higit pa sa akin? Ok lang naman Jake, okay lang. At least hindi ko na iisipin kung ano pa yung mga pwedeng mangyari kung sakaling dumating yung panahon na mahalin kita.  Nung pauwi na kami, tinanong ako ni Ron kung bakit tahimik ako buong gabi. Sabi niya, siguro nagseselos daw ako sa girlfriend mo kase dati close daw tayo.  As usual, deny naman ako.  Pero pagtingin ko sa rearview mirror ng kotse ni Ron, nakita ko, sa mga mata ko, ang dating kinang na nakikita ko kapag sinasabi mong ako lang ang tanging taong ginawa para bigyan ng halaga ang pagkabuhay mo sa mundo.

       My constant unawareness for all the actions I've been doing and the usually anticipated consequences lead me to this misery....   -- My latest Vandal in a table in GenRef, MainLib last Saturday  *****  Siguro mababaliw lahat ng tao sa paligid ko kung bigla akong mawawala at gagawin ang lahat ng gusto ko. Sa Friday ay binibigyan ulit ako ng chance na gawin yun. Dumating ang isa kong milyonaryong kamag-anak (ang natatanging milyonaryo sa pamilya) at lahat kame ay iilibre sa Boracay sa darating na weekend. Makakarating na naman ako sa aking lupang sinilangan (isang hallucination) at malamang ay sabay na maghanap ng trabaho dun.  Yun lang ang gusto ko: Ang tumira sa Boracay, matutong mag-surf at ipagpatuloy ang snorkling at magkaron ng lisensya sa diving. Malamang dun narin mag-asawa, who knows? At malamang maghanap ng NGO para sa mga IP, lalo na yung sa Manok-manok, tabi ng seashore. Yun ang gusto ko. Ang tuluyang manirahan sa tabi ng isang dagat para tuwing pagising ko sa umaga, ang tunog ng mga alon ang naririnig ko. Pagbangon ko, sanay na ako sa lugar. Makakapaglakad na ako ng nakapikit pamunta sa mapuputing buhangin at patuloy kong gigisingin ang aking araw sa pamamagitan ng sariling pagbibinyag sa luha ng mga serena. At higit sa lahat, sakyan ang mga alon na dulot ng pag-aaway ng mga likhang nilalang na na naninirahan sa ilalim ng tinatahak ko.   Ngunit hindi pa pwede. Hindi muna.    *****   You said you didn't know. That after reading my entry about you, all you wanna do is take me in your arms and never let me go. That perhaps, perhaps,   WE   are meant to be and that she was just there to throw us off track. I almost believed you. I did. Because you said this when your eyes were shining, tears nearing to slide down. But of course, I didn't.  But how could you expect me to? The whole night you acted as if I'm just one of those friends you invited for your birthday. That everything you did for me was done out of boredom and not out of love. That maybe, what you did was out of pity. That you're really sorry for what is happening in my life and that you just wish to save me again from misery and pain that I usually go through.  But that didn't move me. Didn't make me believe that what you were saying was true. I just looked at you straight in the eye, my heart full of hatred for what you did. You promised you'll wait for me. You said that not even a month ago. And I end up seeing you with a girlfriend?  *****   Parang ayoko na yata Nakakasawa rin pala ang iyong mukha At kung may balak ka pang ulitin sakin yon May ibubulong ako sayo  Putang Ina Mo     ---- Parang Ayoko na Yata, Parokya Ni Edgar

       I was in the mood to annoy people.  Haven't gotten any sleep when he texted and asked if I could meet him outside, drizzling and cold, so that he could have someone by his side to share his loneliness. True to the fact that I'm more than a good friend, I readily agreed to his proposal.  He thinks that his girl is having an affair. Since I was in the mood to bitch, I told him that I saw her in the mall, with this guy and they were holding hands and sharing a good laugh. He asked when was this.  About three weeks ago . He was surprised. And angry. Guess to whom?  Yours fucking truly.   Better try me in a good mood. Better yet, ask me something like if there is no available water around you and all you got is a surrounding of oil spills, will you drink from it?    SAGOT!     Will you ever learn?   *****  It was karma. I was annoying all living creatures that came across my senses last night, even with this friend who is a Joross lookalike. Nothing beats a good laugh when you're really tired and you wanna sleep but your eyes and spirit seemed not to cooperate. Aside from the bitchy remarks I laid on everyone during the AA meeting, Joross lookalike I bet is thinking if he should have had me deposited in Mental last night.  Too mental.   So when I received the text of Mike that I was in the headline of tabloid today, I couldn't help but think that this is just a pseudo-but-not-nearly a backfire.   "Boobsie, headline ka talaga!  Boobsie, Pinulutan sa Resort ."    To hell with them.   *****  It has been three weeks since I last saw my room clean. Three heavenly-like weeks. Now, now?  I'm living in a dumpster.    Bed:  Don't make me start. I literally cannot see what my bedsheet is with all the piles of clothes, pillows, shoes, and books atop of it. Set them aside every night for a small space to sleep in. I actually broke two CDs last night because I slept on them. What will I be breaking next?   Cabinet:  Do you know how many pairs of attire I go through every morning before I finally settle to  DA ONE ? Five on the average.  On the average.  After that, I stuff, no, throw them all back in the cabinet without even folding them. And they keep on piling up. I actually saw the pink sleeve of a favorite cardigan earlier. Had been looking for this months ago. And I can't believe I have soooo many bags. Bags. Even found a the partner of my white stiletto which I thought I left in a friend's house.   Table:  Labor Code, Kundera Book, Beads, Jewelries, Stuffed Toys, Frisbee, Nursing Books, Basketball, Hammock, Nail Polish, Pens, Pencils, Drawing Books, Styrofoam, Glue gun, FHMs, Newspapers, Papers, Papers, Papers.... All in one table.   Grabe. I need a day off to clean this mess.  *****   "It's easy for me to love you because you're beautiful."    -- A guy who once courted me last year said.

I miss walking down Sunken and playing with that red frisbee you gave me. I miss Rodic's. I miss all those loose change that you let me have just so that my purse will be full.

      Kaninang madaling-madaling araw, nag-ring ang mobile ko. Isang unknown number na naman ang tumatawag. At sa lakas ng kulo ng adbentyur sa dugo ko, bigla akong nagising at sinagot ang call. Si Jamek pala. Ayun at lango na naman sa kalungkutan ang aking perennial star-watching-buddy sa Sunken tuwing depressed.  As usual, sumaklolo naman ako.   Sabi niya na pagod na raw siya sa Maynila. Ang bawat hinaing ng mga taong nangangailangan ay natatakpan ng usok ng polusyon at nababalot sa mga pangako ng mga politikong kahit kailan man ay hindi magiging statesmen. Na kahit anong pagpupumilit ang gawin niya, hindi na niya kayang isalba ang buhay ng mga bata dahil sila mismo ay hindi kumikilos para sa sarili nila.  Hindi ako nakaimik.  Nanggaling ito sa taong kaparehong-kapareho ng prinsipyo ko.  Na walang pinangarap sa buhay kundi maiangat ang kalagayan ng mga nangangailangan. At ngayon ay nadi-disillusion siya. Wala naman akong magawa dahil alam ko na may bahid (BAHID LANG HA!) ng katotohanan ang mga sinabi niya. Gusto na niyang sumama sa akin sa mga plano ko. Pero minsan napag-isip-isip ko na pano mo nga ba naman tutulungan ang mga taong ayaw tulungan ang mga sarili nila? Iba-iba ang uri ng tao at pagkatao, at ang isang bagay na makakabuti para sa isa ay hindi nangangahulugang makakabuti sa susunod. Sabi pa nga ng Law Profs ko, Those who have less in life should have more in laws.  Hay naku, wateber.    Kaya tuloy naisip ko na ang lahat ng mga sinusuong ng mga advocates ay mga bagay na wala silang alam. Gusto nilang umangat lahat ng mga entrepreneurs pero alam ba nila ang magiging setting ng mundo kung lahat na sila ay maunlad? Gusto nating mawala ang mga street children pero do you actually believe that the world would be a better place less them? Ang mga bagay na pinapangarap natin ay mga bagay na hindi pa nag-eexist sa ating karanasan. Kaya nga tayo puro teorya at assumptions.  Sabi ko sa kanya, kung sasama ka sa akin sa _______, ako mismo, ngayon palang, nag-aalangan kung ano ang kahaharapin ko. Kase ang hakbang na gagawin ko ay isang bagay na hindi ko alam; gusto ko siya maramdaman at mangyari pero hindi ko alam kung ano siya.    Wala akong kaalam-alam.   Nung tanungin ko ulit siya kung handa na ba siyang sumama sa pakikibaka ko sa isang unknown na buhay, hindi niya alam ang sisasagot dahil mismong ang pag-submit sa plano ng isang taong katulad ko ay isang bagay na hindi niya alam ngunit naninimbang na ayaw maranasan.  *****   I'm missing sex . Yes guys, I'm missing sex. Ang haven't been completely truthful with my coital standing to most of you. Common press releases:   To those who warned me after the January event:  No sex after D n C.   To those who didn't know what had happened:  Two months ago.   Closest friends:  Last weekend.   People I barely knew:  Virgin to the max.  Honestly, I last slept with someone three Saturdays ago. With an ex.  (Note: Don't bother texting me, it would never happen again I bet my life on that one). It was the call of the flesh on his part. And I was a willing victim to submit to his whims.  My conscience was bugging me last night since I knew that he already is living with his girlfriend and they have a three-month old baby. Who cares?! For all we know he's not the father of the kid  (Oooopppsss).   Nweis, I came to a decision to fulfill my Midyear Resolution of celibacy for the rest of the year. I was already resolved and was prepared to wear a mental chastity belt when I heard the song beat   "All day long I think about sex... and all night long I dream about sex...."    I slammed the door of my room and lay down in bed. A ritual of mine before going to my night-reading is scanning cable channels to see if anything good is on. Maybe faith and all the karma gods were against me that night when the remote stopped at MYX and the program was featuring old music videos. Timing as what all of you might say but I had no choice but to hum along with the (in)famous song of the Divinyls:    "Oh, I don't want anybody else... When I think about you I touch myself...."     Please close the lights and let me experience euphoria...

It has been a while since I thought about you. Heck, I wouldn't even have thought about you if hadn't called. Two hours from now, you'll be in front of our gate, making a missed call in my mobile. I hafta admit that I did miss this.  It has been a while. Two weeks? And still counting since I last saw you. With that stupid long mane trailing down that muscled back. That strong hands, with the grip always finding a way to mine's. That manly laugh that comes out of that sweet, small mouth everytime I lay a crazy idea.     What is the morality behind loving someone besides the one you're currently with?   This was the last text that I got from you. Last Sunday. And it moved me to tears knowing that this one who had once been a part of my life is feeling that same pain that I was going thru at that moment.   Should I love you again or should I not love you?  This question had been bugging me for almost an hour already.In the end, all you have to think about is that are you willing to be a third party again?  *****   Confirm the bitchiness of this queen, please....

      Wala na siguro salitang pwede kong masabi sa iyo kundi maraming salamat. Maraming salamat sa lahat-lahat ng bagay na binigay mo, sa mga memoryang iniwan mo, sa mga payong dadalin ko kung umabot man ako sa katandaan, sa init na nagmula sayo. Yan lamang, at salamat.   Kailan ko ba naisip na ito ang pinakamabuting bagay na maririnig mo sa akin pagkatapos ng lahat?  Naaalala ko na: nung nakita kitang umiiyak at sinabing bigyan pa kita ng isang pagkakataon dahil alam mo na alam ko na tayo ay kabilang sa mga taong iisa lang ang dahilan kung bakit ginawa sa mundo. At kung totoo nga ang teoryang si Eba ay mula sa tadyang ni Adan, tayong dalawa ang nabuhay para bigyan ng kahulugan ang kuro-kurong nilikha ng kasulatang ito. At nung sabihin mo ring hihiwalayan mo siya, bigyan lang kita ng panahon at ipapakita mo kung gaano mo ako kamahal at pati narin ang pagsisisi mo kung bakit hindi ka naghintay. Matapos ang lahat ng mga sinabi mo, wala akong ibang naramdaman at gustong sabihin kundi ang   salamat  .  Salamat dahil sayo, nalaman kong may mga luhang hindi totoo. Na nung umiiyak ako sa iyo dahil hindi ko alam ang patutunguhan ng buhay ko, umiyak karin, dahil... yun ang dapat . At nung umiyak ka nung nasa bus station tayo nung balak ko nang iwan ang lahat, drama lang yun. Salamat dahil ipinakita mo sa akin ang kapaitan ng ibig sabihin kapag may lumalabas kuno na hinanakit diyan sa mga mata mo. Pawang pisikal at hindi emosyonal.  Salamat din dahil narin sayo, natuto akong huwag agad maniwala sa mga pangako. Na may mga salitang binibitawan ngunit wala naman talagang kahulugan. Na kahit alam kong hindi mo maaaring sungkitin ang buwan para sa akin, ang simpleng paghawak at pagpisil mo nalang sa kamay ko nung sinabi mo yun, kasinungalingan na. Salamat dahil sayo, nalaman ko na ang salita ay pawang mga simbolong tinawag na letra na inimbentuhan ng tunog at para mas masaya, binigyan kuno ng kahulugan.... ngunit hindi naman talaga nagpapakita ng tunay na nararamdaman.  Kaya nung umiyak ako sa iyo kagabi, nung sabihin kong hihintayin kita, lahat yun ay puro mga kasinungalingan. Kasinungalingang itunuro mo at nanggaling sa iyo. Dahil wala na sigurong ibang paraan para malaman mo hindi ako para sa iyo. Na may mga bagay na sadyang pinaglalaruan dahil hindi maatim ng pusong may nasasaktan.    Ngunit salamat.  Sa pagbabalat-kayo, sa kunwaring pagdamay, sa pekeng pakikihati ng kalungkutan, sa kaluluwang nagmamaang-maangan. Sa huli, ang ikabubuo ng mga bagay na natutunan ko sa iyo ay ang pagiging isang taong walang puso, puno ng hinanakit at napaka  sarkastiko .   Ay, baka makalimutan ko,  SALAMAT .

        Madness ka Jake, madness ka....     &nbsp;  *****   It was the usual bi-monthly Friday night dinners with friends. I went straight from a visit from a client as to that I arrived late in Tree House. We were all complete, except for one.&nbsp;Except for you. And they knew. They knew what had happened between us and they asked if it's still happening.  &nbsp; No, I said in half shrug and half certainty. Certainty. I was okay that night. Surprisingly, I didn't get drunk but you wouldn't know and you wouldn't care because you weren't there. &nbsp; Then you called. You were just outside and you wanted to talk.   Could I leave early?   &nbsp; As usual, stupid me followed your suggestion. &nbsp; And there you are, outside, with a slight drizzle falling down those shoulders, one hand in your pocket and the other holding a folded umbrella, hair still a bit messy from the wind, with a half-pretty-sad smile painted on that beautiful face. You still never fail to take my breath away. And you're more beautiful looking lonely. You hurriedly approached me, opening the umbrella in the process.  &nbsp;   "C'mon....I have a surprise for you."   &nbsp; Without any hesitation, I let you held my hand, pressing them both tight like young lovers meeting at a rendezvous. Again, exactly at that time, I felt that I could do this foreve; walk with you aimlessly to nowhere. But then again, there is the fact that I don't have you anymore. &nbsp; You finally found the chords of  Drops of Jupiter . And you were serenading me with the song, my song. I was really lucky to hold back tears because if they would gush out, all I'll do next is to run in your arms and tell you to run away with me. But I held them. My tears and my pain. I slept beside you that night, in Pat's house. I woke up finding you looking at me. &nbsp;   I could do this everyday  , you told me. &nbsp; But then again, I don't have you and I can never be your forever. I died the day you celebrated your birth. Or maybe, I just realized that we weren't meant to be...   &nbsp;

      I hate umbrellas. There was an instance I left a Western Union umbrella in the bus deliberately because I despised,  DESPISED , carrying it. I hate umbrellas. Even the folded ones. &nbsp; ***** &nbsp; I remember walking in the rain No umbrella with your arms around me How can I forget that was the last time? &nbsp;   -- No Umbrella, Cynthia Alexander   &nbsp; ***** &nbsp; Posible bang magmahal ng dalawa ng sabay?  &nbsp;   Pwede Pwede   &nbsp;

      Minsan darating ka sa punto ng buhay mo na magtatanong ka kung bakit kailangan mong mapagod ng ganito. Na inaakala ng mga tao na sila ang sinasaktan mo, hindi nila alam na sila pala ang nananakit sayo.  Ngayon, tunay kong masasabi na pagod na ako. Pagod na ako sa mga taong nangangako, sa mga taong nagsasabing mahal ako, at sa mga taong inaasahan kong nandiyan kung kelan nasa punto na ako ng kawalang pag-asa at gusto ng magpakamatay. Dahil narin siguro dito, hindi maiaalis na maging ganito ang reaksyon ko sa mga tao.   Siguro isang tulak pa, susundin ko na ang gusto ko kahit hindi dapat. Naiinis at naiiyak akong isipin na walang taong makaintindi sakin at walang taong gusto talagang subukan na gawin yun. Siguro masyadong mahirap para gawin ito.&nbsp; Nararamdaman ko nga minsan na burden ang sa ibang tao ang existence ko.    Kunsabagay, hindi ko naman hiningi sa mundo na buhayin ako....   *****   Wanted:   Pallbearers for my upcoming funeral

      "Tis said of love that it sometimes goes, sometimes flies; runs with one, walks gravely with another; turns a third into ice, and sets a fourth in a flame; it wounds one, another it kills; like lightning it begins and ends in the same moment; it makes that fort yield at night which it besieged   But in the morning,  for there is   No force able to resist it.     --&nbsp; Miguel Cervantes    *****  I think that I'm starting to fall......  Should I like this long-lost but so familiar feeling?     I don gib a pak!

        (Warning: If you don't know the Carpenters, better not&nbsp;read this)        &nbsp;   Name:  R****** D*******   Relationship Span:  April 1, 2002- April 5, 2003   Hobby:  Teaching (patawa)   Best Trait:  Remembers everything I say (said)   *****     Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you    Nice to know somebody loves me    Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do    Run and find the one who loves me     -- Rainy Days and Mondays    I arrived home late last night from work. You had been calling for the past two hours or so, my cousin said. I dunno how to contact you since it had been a while since we last talked and saw each other. While I have had the same mobile number for nearly&nbsp;a year now, you had been one of those in constant itch to change those seven digits every so often. And you haven't been able to keep me updated during those changes.  (What's new?)    But somehow, it still shocked me that you remembered my landline. And as predictable as your usual grimace everytime I bite your shoulder, you called again no sooner than I put my big bag down. You said you missed me and you wanted to greet me personally. You were just in Starbucks Adriatico. You could come by in about 10 minutes. The sudden surge of seeing a former love, I was so excited that even in that minimal time, I was able to take a shower and change in my favorite&nbsp;powder blue halter dress. And of course &nbsp;I was able to spritz the Hugo Red of my sister in my wrists. And was able to slip on that silver bangel Marty gave my last November.     And when the evening comes we smile,    So much of life ahead    We'll find a place where there's room to grow    And yes, We've just begun     -- We've Only Just Begun    I remembered our plans. Live-in set-up after you graduate. Six kids. A restaurant business.&nbsp; Then we'll travel in Europe. You'll tell that I'm secured when I sleep and everything would be alright when you're there. You were my first and though you weren't that good, everything just became better everytime we share special&nbsp;physical (combined with emotional)....   emissions.  &nbsp;We were&nbsp;more than&nbsp;in-love: we were mature enough to handle such concrete plans. &nbsp;Who would have thought that after a year and a few months, you and our dreams would just be....  just dreams?      Love, look at the two of us    Strangers in many ways     -- For All We Know    Then the daily lunches became twice to once a week. Dates diminished from weekly to bi-monthly. I became engrossed with work, while you with your thesis. Calls before sleeping were no longer anticipated. I love you texts suddenly felt routinary. I missed the old  US  but I guess this was part of growing up:   to be able to set your priorities and neglect those that wouldn't contribute much to your future.   Though I was forcing to resist the reality, you all along, had just been looking for a way to soften the blow.     Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?    You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby    Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby    I love you, I really do     -- Superstar    The break-up was inevitable. It was coming, I had no other choice but to let it be. I can see the struggle in your eyes: the struggle to get out of this commitment that had turned-out to be a mess. Actually,&nbsp; I was also longing for it. Our relationship was for reference; sometime ago, I had a more-than-a-year-boyfriend. A few days after the anniversary, we both decided to we were too young to take each other seriously. And this relationship seriously.   What pained me most is something I had known way after the break-up. It was just this March. I saw you in G4. You already have a nine-month old baby girl.  So let's do the math :   (1)   We broke up 11 months ago   (2)   Nine months to carry a baby   (3)   Nine months is your kid. Answer:   (A)   You cheated on me   (B)   You had sex with someone and therefore please refer to A.  Guess what's the answer?      It's going to take some time this time    No matter what I've planned    But like the young trees in the wintertime    I'll learn how to bend     -- It's Going to Take Some Time    Who cares?! I was just shocked that you actually cheated on me. But hey, after you, I also had my fair share of cheating too  (hindi nga lang sayo).  Suddenly, long&nbsp;after that fateful day, you decided to contact me to greet me a happy birthday. And you said you missed me. And I missed you too. So it wasn't that hard for me to decide to let you see me.     I think I'm gonna be sad    I think it's today, yeh    The boy that's driving me mad    Is going away     -- Ticket to Ride (Remake)    You actually looked good. Heck, I was actually contemplating on sleeping with you last night  (thank juice you don't know about my blog!).  You were leaving for Cali (for good) next week and you wanted to see me. You had that silly grin in your face as you leaned over and gave me a birthday peck on the..... Just then, I realized that everything I went through with you was worth it, and would repeat it a thousand times over, even the cheating. Like what I said, I'm thankful that I've met you and definitely I'm going to miss you. That's it.  As basic as that .   Seeing you leave was a&nbsp;lonely memory for me. That boy, that man, had taught so many things to me in life. Thankful and loved, he'll always be a part of my "awakenings" and will always bring a blush every fleeting memory of us comes along the way.     I'll say goodbye to love    No one ever cared if I should live or die    Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by    And all I know of love is how to live without it      I just can't seem to find it .    -- Goodbye to Love    *****     (Honestly, these songs were on my mind when I was with him and thinking about our past. Effect of listening to the Singles Album of the Carpenters the whole day yesterday.)

       I see myself....   Learning to ride the waves for the first time. Taking in the scorching sun and the knifing beat of the sea water against my skin.   I see you....   Watching me in the shore, beaming with pride with the goal I've finally had been dreaming to accomplish, coming to life before your eyes.  *****   Thanks for holding my hand last night.   I love you.

      Hindi ko maintindihan kun bakit kailangan ko pang maghintay ng isang taon. Bakit kaya? Siguro hadlang ako sa mga pangarap niya kung nanjan ako sa buhay niya. Kakainis kaseng maghintay eh. Daming beses ko naring narinig sa mga taong pinagkatiwalaan ko na hintayin sila. Para sa wala. Si Rhett, tatlong taon ako pinaghintay kase may contract siya sa Ontario for 3 years. After 2 years, bumalik. Para magpakasal. Si Roberto, hintayin ko lang daw na iwan niya yung girlfriend niya. Ayun at nagpunta sa celebration ng girlfriend sa Pangasinan, pagbalik eh nakalimutan na yata ako. Ni ha, ni ho, wala man lang lakas na ipaalam na mas mahal pala niya yun kase sa akin. Si Jake, maghintay daw kame ng tamang panahon sa aming dalawa, paglingon ko lang ay may syowa na. Tang ina naman. Wala naman sanang bastusan.  Kaya nung hiniling niya ang isang tao, parang "eto na naman tayo." Pero ako kase, hindi ko pinipilit ang isang tao sa isang bagay na hindi pa siya handa. O sa sabing hindi pa raw siya handa. Hindi ko naman kase makita ang point na bakit kailangan ko pang maghintay. Wala naman akong hinihingi sa kanila. Wala naman silang dapat patunayan. Kadalasan naman, wala naman masyadong hadlang. Kaya nagtataka ako kung humihingi lagi ang mga lecheng ito ng panahon. Eh paano naman ako diba? What if tanungin nila ako kung payag ba ako na maghintay. Katulad ni Rhett, ok naman sa akin ang isang long-distance relationship ah, bakit kailangan na kapag bumalik pa siya, dun palang dapat na magsimula kame ng relasyon? Jake is a classic example too. Bakit kailangan pa namin maghintay eh sabi ko naman sa kanya na kung mahal kame ng mga ugok naming kaibigan, maiintindihan nila yung nangyayari sa aming dalawa. Hindi ba? Simple lang naman eh. Yun lang naman. Hindi naman ako humingi ng braso o binti nila. Wala namang perang kasama. Bakit ba sangkatutak ang mga arte nila.  Eto namang si ******, isa pa. Sobrang isa pa. Tatlong taon na nadwindle sa isang taon. Marami pa raw siyang gagawin sa buhay niya. Parang shet, so hadlang pa pala ako? Pakshet talaga. Parang lahat ba sila, hindi nila  kayang makuha lahat ng mga gusto nila kung nanjan ako. Tang na. Sawang-sawa na ako maghintay. Lahat ng hinihintay ko, iniiwan ako. Traumatic na yung linyang mga "let's wait a while." Ang tanong lang naman kase kung gusto mo o ayaw mo. Yun lang. Walang apprehensions. Walang arte. Lahat ng mga taong pinaghintay ako, naiinis sa mga arte ko. Ginagamit ko kase ang neuroticism ko to the extreme degree kung sila kasama ko. Pero yun nalang siguro ang coping mechanism ko. Na inisin sila dahil inis na inis na ako.  Sandali lang, hindi ko matapos ang entry na ito. Could you like wait for two years?  *****  Love makes time pass but Time makes love pass...
