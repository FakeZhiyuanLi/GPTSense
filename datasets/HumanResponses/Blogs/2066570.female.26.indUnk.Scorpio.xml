      Welcome to the newly redesigned uberbliss.com.  I've simplified the main page a bit, since all of the uberbliss posters (what are you people called anyway?) have such different and varied site designs.  If there are any questions or suggestions, please send an email to info@uberbliss.com.  Enjoy!

      Things are slowing down a bit this summer, a few less posts on the various uberbliss sites...clear evidence of a beautiful summer. No worries, we will soon have 1-2 more people throwing down.  And who knows, maybe a few stray authors will come back into the fold.

      Happy Birthday to Jeff Judge. The only date in the calender that could be given as a command to troops. March fourth!  For those of you who don't know Jeff, he is the Most Rockingest, sweetest, Fred Flinstone lookingest, bad mouthed mother that you could ever EVER hope to meet in a dark alley behind an erotic cake shop. Love you Jeff, hope to get very inebriated with you soon. And I mean VERY; the kind of drunk where you don't remember where you live or how to operate a phone to call someone to tell you where it is that you live and you end up passing out on a bench on the subway train and you just ride around all night and are so hung over the next day, that once you do finally get home, all you can do is lay in bed and say, "oh my f*%#ing head." And someone has to take care of you all day and you can barely stand up to even go to the bathroom and forget about being able to keep anything down, including water. On second thought...lets just get some coffee sometime. See you soon at any rate. Best of days to you.

           Flight!   Today, my good friend Jennifer Mifflin is flying from Orlando to Boston.  She is coming to visit me and my other good friend Monica Marie Moore, for the weekend.  Monica does not have to fly, she can drive since she lives in Connecticut.  I don't know how Jenn feels about flying (I'll have to ask her when I see her in 8 hours!!!!!!!) but I love it.   Here's some interesting flying anecdotes: When I flew to Boston for the very first time I had a connection in Chicago.  Of course, Chicago was under the influence of a blizzard and my flight almost didn't make it off the ground.  But it did, and there were only 4 people on the flight (everyone else was moved to other flights earlier).  The flight attendant let me sit in first class and gave me all the first class amenities like freshly baked cookies, more drink options and really nice blankets.  I had never been on the East Coast before and I remember looking out the window and seeing all these glass circley things on the ground.  Finally I asked the flight attendant- what's that?  She looked at my strangely and said, "I think  its a lake"  I couldn't believe it!  There are SO MANY lakes and ponds and rivers and bodies of water in Massachusetts.  There is definitely not that much water in Ohio or Illinois.  I was fascinated. Another time, when I was flying home from my first trip to LA (to visit my good friend Jennifer Slutz who is not able to make this reunion because she just got a cool new job at Disney) I realized the exhaustive nature of traveling and how a plane is the perfect place to cry.  When one visits Jen she will have the most fun ever, for every single minute of every single day, and by the time she gets to the airport she's just DONE.  But the tiredness (at least for me) seems to be compounded and magnified by the fact that you are traveling at 400 miles an hour.  Its like you are also tired for the plane, which probably didn't even get to go to the beach while it was in LA.  I remember sitting in my little seat (they didn't let me sit in first class this time) and finding that I was sad that my adventure was over, that I couldn't wait to get home and that I probably wouldn't see Jen for at least six months.  These realizations along with the tiredness started the crying.  And everytime since then I have been at least a little teary eyed on my flights home..... once it was because this damn teenager wouldn't turn off JayZ's "me and my girlfriend" for the 4 hours of the flight... but still.   And so, I wish Jenn a most exciting plane ride!  Good luck getting moved up to first class!

           I live in Boston, and yet.........   I have lived in Boston for 2 1/2 years and there are still "Boston" things that I haven't done.  For example:   1) I haven't been out on the ocean.  AT ALL.  AT ALL AT ALL.  I want to go on the ocean.  I would like to go on a whale watch, or go sailing or kayak out to the little islands.  I just haven't.  The closest I have been to the ocean is on a Duck Tour on the Charles.  In fact, I drove the duck.  Here's a picture of me driving the duck.  Please, all of you who love me, ignore the crazy red hair!!  Everyone knows it was a mistake :)  urlLink Amanda driving.jpg  2) Relatedly, I have never beeon on the Swan boats.  My Mom came out to visit recently and we were going to go on them, but we were tired and it was more important that she see Filenes Basement than the Public Garden. 3) I have never been to the Cape.  This one shocks most people.  This Summer there were two TRA's on the Cape but because I came onto the job last, I had to do Lowell and Springfield instead. :(  Somehow it doesn't seem fair.  I have high hopes to get to the Cape next Summer. 4) I have never been properly Leaf Peepin'.  I am looking out my office window now and I can see leaves, don't doubt it.  But I have never been on one of those trips to the White Mountains to stay in a cabin and drive around saying things like "Wow, look how red that tree is!" and "Goodness, the leaves are all off that tree!"  I say those things around here so I don't feel too denied, but it would be nice to say I've been "Leaf Peepin'" and finally, 5) I've never been in the Hancock building.   I have been in the Pru, but never the Hancock.  I've been to the Hancock in Chicago but not Boston.  I wonder if that's really an anomaly though.  In fact, if  you've  been in the Hancock building in Boston, please tell in the comments field below.  Inquiring minds (mine) want to know.  A quick non-sequitur: My college roommates are coming to visit tomorrow!!  Monica and Miffie are taking Boston by storm and we are going to do seriously fun things.  Make sure you check this website next week as I will have lots to say!!!

           Favorite things!  Here are five of my favorite things (in no particular order): 1) Google image search:  I discovered this wealth of existential fun when I began this website.  What you do is go to images.google.com and put in a word. ANY WORD.  And then up pops millions of images with similar file names.  I know this sounds basic and boring and your opinion of me just shot down from "interesting" to "less interesting."  But I dare you to try it and not smile at least once.  For example.  When I put in the word "work" you get everything from the obligatory Dilbert cartoons, to clip art images to logos, to pictures of dogs of working breeds.  There's even a picture of an octopus riding a bike.  Its good stuff.  The best thing is when you get an artists website and see some artwork that a real live person in Utah has done- and its moving! (my "headache" graphic is one of those). Try it, you'll like it. 2) Omelets, casseroles, soups and other one dish meals.  I don't know what's better than to have some conglomeration of your favorite foods ready for consumption with preparation requiring one pot or pan.  Burritos fall into this category, as do salads and stews.  I love them all. I like to sit down across from my food and not worry if they touch, because they were all cooked together.  I really, really like one dish meals.  Once, my Grandma gave me a one dish cookbook, and before I lost it, I used it a lot! 3) Taking adventures.  An adventure can be something as small as going to the grocery store if you are in the right mood.  For example, I like to pick a recipe out of a cook book, write down the ingredients and then go to the grocery store and find things like "Cruminane" in the spice aisle.  Or a common variation on this game is that Amanda writes down the ingredients and leaves the list at home accidentally, thereby forcing herself to try to remember that there are spices in the dish, let alone the name of something like Cruminane.  Other exciting adventures include finding small festivals in small towns to visit, going to the free exhibits at the MFA, or going to a new T stop and seeing what there is to see (This can be a somewhat dangerous adventure when taken at night).  I suggest that everyone try to have an adventure today. 4)  Menthol throat spray.  OH MAN.  I love this stuff! It's great when you have a sore throat of course, but its even better when you don't.  I love how your throat begins to tingle and when you breathe its like an avalanche down your esophagus. Oh, and drink a glass of water right after and the tingle will go all the way down to your stomach.   I also enjoy menthol cough drops, but its not as fun as the spray.   5)  Friends.  Old and New.  Here's a representative sample: Miffie Jen S Sara Noemi Char Ann Daniel Daniel Lisa Bruce Genie Monnie  The Shim Sungers!!! Jen O My Grandpa  Baby Ohs My favorite Webmaster- JJJ Ryan Holman Eddie Dana Un Mee Park Stefani Theresa My Grandma My cousin Jessie Pilar Shirley Margaret AND SO MANY MORE.... Without friends I wouldn't have anyone to go to the movies with, no one to eat dinner with, no one to cry on,  no one to dance with and no one to laugh with.  Hooray for you guys!

           Under the Influence of Shim Sung  Last weekend I attended Shim Sung, a workshop offered by my yoga center that is designed to help you find your "true self."  This is all the world will tell you before you go and do Shim Sung, and out of respect that is all I will tell you too.  I will, however, tell you how I feel now, because that does not give away any of the divine secrets of Shim Sung.   During the two day workshop my emotions went on a roller coaster.  I felt so high, so low, so energized and so tired.  Today, I am sore, tired, drawn to naps of waking sleep and a little bit in despair.  The waking sleep comes from having an open, awake mind cognizant of midterms and forthcoming work day challenges, and an exhausted body.  The despair comes from just the opposite.  My body woke up this morning tired, but READY.  "Do we get to do Shim Sung again today?" it asked me.  I had to tell it no, that we had to learn how to use FrameMaker instead.  At first it didn't believe me, as soon as I was warm it started sweating and asked again "Do we get to Shim Sung again today?"  Again, I told it no, it was just hot on the T.   My body was awake, it wanted to do Shim Sung!  My mind, however felt the strain.  It's my mind, afterall, that has to figure out how to live Shim Sung in the real world.  And it's stumped.  It's tired (what with all the crying), it's got all this new stuff to think about, and it's stumped.  The combination of the puppy that took over my body (ooh, ooh, ooh!  Is it time???) and the confusion and loneliness that my mind feels in the face of this challenge leads a little bit to despair.  I liken it to the last day of camp, when you have to say goodbye to the people who made it possible to survive in this new place, and made you a little bit cooler in the process.   The smart people at Dahn have thought of this as well, however.  The last thing that was said to me was, "Get to the first class you can.  You can't do this alone."  And so, once I post this, off I go to class.  The "real world" will take over tomorrow when I take a midterm and go back to work.  Today, however, I am happily existing under the rosy, if complicated, influence of Shim Sung.

           ITS THE WEEKEND!!  Hello WORLD!  Its the weekend I get to leave work early!  Its only because I promised myself to write everyday that I am still here at MASSPAR.  Life is good when you get to leave early! This weekend I am going on a yoga retreat.  This seems to confuse my non-yoga friends and elate my yoga friends.  The yoga friends who have done this retreat before fall all over themselves to say nothing about it.  They make cryptic comments like "I can't tell you about it, you'll see why" but then they launch into long descriptive paragraphs using words like opening, life changing, wonderful, etc.  My non-yoga friends look at my and ask "Are they gonna ask you to be quiet for hours and stretch all day" because they know how unlikely it is that I would enjoy that.  I am not that good at being quiet and sitting still.   Nonetheless I am excited about it.  I don't have any other plans for this weekend, and I am hoping to really rest and get some good "me time" in.  This, honestly, usually results in   me  getting bored and asking myself if we can call our friends and go do something.  Here's hoping a yoga retreat will make me more able to hang out with myself.   I am however reading a GREAT book (The time travelers wife- I can hardly leave the house its so good) and so maybe that will be enough entertainment for me and me.  Later Gators, see you next week!!

          EARLY MORNING DANCE PARTY!!   Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, at the Brookline Dahn Yoga center, 6 souls converge.  Music is played, bodies move, and those lucky souls forget that its 7AM and they would rather be in bed.  We are an unlikely crowd- a hugarian beauty who used to be a dancer, an extremely tall man from Israel, a graphic designer from the South End, a painter with more energy than a puppy, an enthusiastic yoga instructor, and me.  Despite our differences, we are drawn together and energy flows, drawing us close and helping us understand. Dance is a magical thing for me.  For one thing, I am officially VERY bad at it.  When I did musical theater in high school and college, I had to be given private lessons to conquer the box step.  I was cut out of a ballroom dance scene in the Secret Garden, I was not even allowed to be in a Bob Fosse musical- even in a non-dancing part.  However, I got rhythm!  I can go to a dance club and bring down the house.  Its when my body is let loose that I feel most myself.  Through dance I get to express myself without censure.  I find that my physical body sort of takes over and my brain shuts down.  Suddenly I am just me, not me with the witty comments and the emotional barriers, just me.  And I like it! I think that the others from Early Morning Dance Party like it too.  And can I toot my own horn?  I guess I can since its my website!  I started it!  I was doing this terrible posture that we are forced to do in class far too often (sleeping tiger) and I was doing anything to make myself forget that my knees, ankles and arms were in excruciating pain.  Suddenly, out of the heavens, a beacon of light shone down and a voice said "Amanda, make them dance!" The idea, I like to say, came from the Dahn God.  So I pleaded and prodded and rallied support and suddenly Early Morning Dance Party was a reality!  And its a reality that I love, and I truly appreciate.

          Migraines  Depending on  my mood, I can say that I have had a headache since this morning, for a week, or for the last 10 years.  All of these would be true statements.  My headaches have been a monitor, a menace and a blessing.   Whenever anything happens, like I get nervous, irritated, upset, angry, tired, or tense, I get a headache.  Its the emotional monitor.  Sometimes, I would get a headache and  then  realize that I was tense.   Recently, my headaches have gotten a lot worse.  Last March, I had the worst headache of my life (I had to have my then boyfriend leave work and bring me food) and unfortunately it wasn't an anomaly.  I have had about three of them since then.  Finally, last month, I went to the Neurologist and he has put me on daily medication and a strict diet regimen.  Its terrible, and great.  I haven't had many headaches and the ones I do get (like the one I have right now) aren't that bad.  The worst thing is that my ADDICTION to coffee is denied to me.  I went into Dunkin the other day for the first time since I had to give it up and wanted to cry, it smelled so good.  I am waiting to hear from my neurologist if I am allowed to have decaf....   Finally, I must give props where props are due- if it weren't for my headaches, I would probably run myself into the ground on a regular basis.  Its only when I have a headache that I go home and go to bed early.  Its when I have a headache that I say "no" to my friends when they ask me to do things.  Now, all I need to do is figure out how to take care of myself without the headaches, because there are times when I really want to do something and can't because I have a headache.

          The magic birthday cake!    BIRTHDAYS!!!  I love birthdays!  This weekend two of my very good friends had birthdays.  I attended two birthday parties and helped to plan one of them.  They were both fantastic and I believe that both people felt loved and valued.  And that's what birthday's are about!  Every day we should try to remember how serendipitous it is that we have arrived at these crossroads and found good friends here.  I try to be cognizant of the fact that friends are not bound to us by anything but their will, and I am grateful that my friends have chosen to care about me.  All friends, every day.  However, on somebody's birthday its time to focus on how lucky you are to have that person in particular in your life.  Its a celebration of the fact that this person exists and a celebration that you know them.  For that day, I try to put myself out there and be a cheerleader, a poet, and a planner.  I say nice things, I call and sing on voicemails, I buy presents and I think about them.  I was lucky enough to be allowed to help plan one of the birthday parties and that was super fun!  Her husband and I hung banners, made food, and conspired to keep her out of the house.  He and I bonded over our shared fondness for her.   I think birthday's are magic, and I am delighted to report that I am having one in the very near future!  I try to use my own birthday to outright celebrate myself.  Hooray for me!  I'm glad I'm me!  I don't think that we (or at least I know that I don't) celebrate ourselves enough.  I suggest that we use our birthday to NOT look at our abs suspiciously (are you getting larger?), NOT admonish naps, NOT worry about money and NOT wonder whether our neighbors think we are too loud.  At least, this is what I am going to do on Nov 5th, and you are welcome to come do it with me!

          A-choo!  Yesterday I was getting a cold, and today I have it.  Urrrrgggghhhlleee. It sucks!  I am stuffy headed, my throat hurts, I am sneezing and working through Kleenex like its my job.  I don't like it.   But, in the midst of my cold, the strangest thing happened!  (Those of you who have read my post about baseball will understand just how weird this is.)  I left work early yesterday because I was feeling crappy and needed to sleep.  I stopped at the video store and got "Down with Love" and "40 days and 40 nights."  Two appropriately cheesy chick flicks to get a girl through a troubled night of sneezing and congestion.  I get home, crawl into my purple Sheep Pajamas (They are flannel and are covered with sheep that say "Sheep tight."), snuggle deep into the blankety recesses of my bed, turn on "Down with Love" and immediately fall asleep.  At approximately 8:18 I wake up.  I don't think "Hmm, I should put on 40 days and 40 nights" or "I wonder if Store 24 would look at my flannel PJ's funny if I ran over to get some NyQuill (but I thought that later), and I didn't think "Man am I hungry!"  I thought, brace yourself "I wonder if the Red Sox game is on...." And then, I, Amanda Holman, walked over to my television set, and found the game.  I subsequently watch 6 innings of baseball.  After the 6th inning, when it looked like they could make it without me, I went to bed and waited for the screaming fans when the game is over and won.   No screaming fans at 11.  No screaming fans at 1.  In fact, there were no screaming fans at all.  These no screaming fans made me so concerned that my poor, destitute body fell into the most absurd dream sequence.  I would have a dream where someone famous would come and explain to me why there were no screaming fans when the Red Sox were in the World Series.  Over and over these people (Pedro Martinez was one of them... he's cute!) came to me and explained to me "No, the Red Sox did win, but the police were out making sure they weren't screaming"  "Everyone's in New York"  Etc.  For those of you who don't know, the Red Sox did not win.  Frankly, I am amazed that I cared!  I am amazed that the first thing I did in the car this morning was try to figure out whether they had won.  I am amazed that I had a conversation with my boss about the Red Sox and could contribute somewhat intelligently.  I really think it must be the cold.  I still don't care about baseball! The fever is making me do it!

          Flowering  The human flower has a long life.  I remember in my youth when I assumed, "Eventually I will figure it out, and I will be perfect!  Not only that, but everyone will know it!!!"  And then I would feel both better and worse.  Better because I believed that someday I wouldn't be "like this" anymore, and worse because I like me, and that was mean.  Terror would strike my heart at the thought that I wouldn't someday be perfect.  You don't get anywhere if you aren't perfect!  My flower at that point was bound so tightly there was very little hope of making it into a vase!  Only now, years later, do I begin to understand that perfect is not possible.  I don't pretend to fully realize it, nor do I assert that I am fine with it- rather, I am relieved to begin to see its truth.  I relax a little inside, the constant argument in my head begins to cease somewhat and I begin to forgive others who aren't perfect either.  My flower begins to unfold. I have a friend who always yells at me, ceaselessly, "Mothers do the best they can!"  She will listen to me explain my mother, my relationship with her, our history, and her terrible boyfriend.  She will listen to the detail, she will see the color rise on my face, and she will nod sympathetically.  In the end, however, she will say loudly, so the people at the next table can hear "Mother's do the best they can!!"  She's a mother, they have to stick together.   But its true.  My mother, as a matter of fact, has climbed on a soapbox a few times about how EVERYONE is doing the best they can.  I'm not sure I would go that far (there are an awful lot of times when I don't do the best I can) but I realize, at least, that people are trying.  And there's value in trying, even if you can't succeed.  And that helps my flower unfold a little bit too, because if there's value in other people trying (regardless of success) then there must be value in mine, right?   As my life continues, I will be more accepting of my little flower and let her feel safe enough to open.  I pledge this to myself.....  not because I want to be perfect but because I want to be happy.  Turns out that happiness and striving madly for perfection have a perfect negative correlation.

           The Coveted  This life we live is crazy.  Everyday we are faced with choices, some small (what to eat for breakfast) and some really, really large (like where to move after graduate school).  What they neglect to tell us in school is that once the choice is made, you cannot go back, ever.  I can't go back to this morning and choose to eat oatmeal instead of a trail mix bar, even if it will make me feel better, even if that extra 10 minutes it takes to eat in my house instead of my car would have made my commute faster because I would have missed the traffic from an accident.  The outcomes from our choices never give us the option to go back and change things.  The universe soldier on, never missing a beat.  Never. Sometimes, on rainy/windy days, my choices come back to visit me.  I wonder, what would it have been like to move to Chicago? What if I had never come back from Paris? What if I had chosen the desk with the window view?  What if I had bought a new car?  What if I had never joined the fraternity that made me miserable for 3 years?  What if.......... Normally, I am the first person to get on a soapbox and bark about the fruitlessness of regrets, but on days like today "what if" doesn't feel as dangerous.  It feels whimsical, dreamy, and it helps me see myself more clearly. Here are a few of the things I covet, the choices I sometimes wish I had made.  The big and the small: - When I was in college I had the opportunity to do a Summer in London program.  I had the whole tripped paid for by student loans, the very first student loans I would have taken out (this was the summer before Junior year).  All I had to come up with was airfare and some spending money.  I could have worked while I was there, etc.   For some reason, that I can only chalk up to temporary low self esteem or worthiness issues, I just decided I couldn't do it.  Instead I hung out on campus and had the most miserable summer of my life.  Man oh man.  I think about what that could have done for me!  I want so badly to understand other people, especially people who did not have the same experiences as me.  It might have been great.  'Course my Reaves (my Mothers family) training kicks in right about now "Well, you don't know what it would have been like, what if you were there, miserable, and surrounded by people from Phi Beta Chi (the misery causing fraternity mentioned before)!"  - When I was in high school there was a girl who was the twin sister of someone I was friends with.  She was a pretty nice girl but for some reason she just annoyed the hell out of me.  I have this button deep inside me: if someone annoys me I want them out of my sight.  I can be abrasive and abrupt and hurtful.  She was one of those people. I would do stupid high school things like not invite her to something and invite her sister and then talk about it in front of her.  Ah, so mean.  I wish that I were someone who was able to be gracious to everyone, all the time.  I can't imagine what a difference that would make in my life. - When my job moved from one office to the other (this was on my second day of work) we got a lot more space and had a choice of where to put our desks.  I chose a place in a nook, because generally, I like nooks.  However!  Little did I know that the window view from where my co-worker put her desk would be so much nicer!  I have a view of a parking lot and half a tree.  She has a view of a lot of trees, the road and the shopping center across the street.  Sometimes, when she's out, I will eat my lunch at her desk and stare out her window.  Other times, when she's in, I watch her staring out the window and covet her view jealously.   - Finally, I wish I had taken one of the many, many, many impulses I have to live abroad.  To just up and go.  Like in the FABULOUS new movie "Under the Tuscan Sun."  I know that it would be hard and not a barrel of existential monkeys, but oh the things you'd learn!  Sometimes I think I get too caught up in what's expected of me and then don't grab at adventure like I would like.  But I am working on it, and I hope that this desire is put to rest through experience.   That's enough about regrets and being covetous, its not generally in my nature and my preachy side is starting to bang against my head saying "Amanda Jane, you know better than this!"  And I do.............  But MAN- can you imagine spending your early 20's in Australia!?

          This is a Boston.com branded image.    Online Dating  The story always begins as follows: "My friend Lucy met her boyfriend through Boston.com personals and convinced me to try it out!  So, here I am!"  And that's the truth.  But here's the other truth: I had been hearing a lot about the online dating scene and it kept sounding  more and more reputable.  So, when my friend Lucy came to town to help her boyfriend (there personal ad one!) move to be with her in New York, I pumped her for information.  So she didn't so much as convince me, as provide me with the information for me to convince myself.   Its not that difficult to see why people post personal ads:  dating sucks.  And you know what sucks the most?  Never really knowing if the person you are flirting with at the bar/grocery store/bus stop would EVER have the nerve to ask you out.  And I know for a fact that  I  do NOT have that nerve.  With a personal ad everyone's intent is right out there.  You don't post on a personals website if you don't want to eventually go out on a date.  This provides exactly the right amount of bolster for the guy to ask you out! Here's another great thing about personal ads: for as long as you want it to be, the contact is anonymous.  Boston.com, at least (this is the only one I have ever used), provides you with a message center.  Its a little e-mail inbox with no address, no identifying information and no forwarding address.  The message is filtered through Boston.com and sent to an anonymous name, which means that no man will show up at my door with a chainsaw. The best thing about the personal ad is that you can date on your own time.  Its like those ads for online shopping, where they boast about how you can shop in your underoos.  Well, with personal ads a great deal of the most awkward contact can take place in your underoos!  There is no makeup, ironing, or tall shoes involved in the initial stages of online dating.   So, if you find yourself tired of "missed connections" at the bus stop, drunk men at bars, and lack the nerve to talk to Mr. Khakis and button down on the T, then I suggest you try it.  Its really not creepy and only one guy asked me if I was interested in meeting him  and  his wife.    In case you don't have a Lucy, here is the run down on the basics of online dating at Boston.com: - Go to www.boston.com/personals and sign up.   - You will be asked to create a profile name and answer a series of questions.  There are quite a few lame questions, such as "______ is sexy; _________ is sexier".  Its difficult to come up with answers that are grammatically correct.  I suggest you create your profile when you are feeling chatty and are in a good mood.  You can always tell when someone has created their profile when they should have been drinking coffee.  (note:  If you don't answer a question it doesn't show up on the profile at all- its better to not answer the question than to comment inanely about how inane said question is.)  - When creating your profile you will be forced to examine your views on pictures.  Some people post terrible pictures, some people post nice pictures, some people post no picture at all.  I chose to post a self portrait, though I do have an actual picture for people I intend to meet.  Here is the self portrait for your viewing pleasure:  urlLink self portrait.bmp  - Once you have created your profile you can browse through the other people's ads.  This is great because you can be as judgmental as you want and no one gets hurt! - That said, If you see someone you think is HOT, or seems funny, then you can click on his profile and send him a message.  Here's the catch (but its small).  You have two options: pay $25, get 25 credits and spend one of those on this hot man (each initial message is one credit) or you can send him a collect call for free.  NO ONE answers collect calls.  Ever.  I suggest paying the money.  (I still have 13 credits, a month and a half later).  Although the first message is one credit, all further messages to the same lucky bloke are free, which seems fair. - Once you have made contact with a guy, like and trust him at least a little, then you can give him your real e-mail address.  This begins the underoos stage.  After 4-6 e-mails, he says (or you, if you are daring) "Lets get a beer or a coffee" and you're off!!  If you are like Lucy, you will meet your match on your first time out of the gate.  If you are like me, you will meet some nice people, talk with them, meet up and enjoy it very much.  I have not yet met my dating match, though I have hope for the future. In the meantime, I am practicing on Boston.com.

       Its raining, its pouring, the old man is snoring, and I want to join him.  I can't mentally get out of bed today.  While my body strives down sodden paths, soldiers through puddles, and conquers flooded cross walks, my mind langorously turns amid pillows; tenses briefly only to feel blissful relaxation.  At traffic lights I dream of pillows, yearn for fluffy blankets and feel a deep desire for the melted mind, on the edge of sleep.   I arrive at my house half-way there.  I pause here briefly to report that I am indeed going to take a nap.

          I don't like baseball.  I don't understand it, therefore I don't like to watch it, therefore I don't find it interesting to talk about/hear about.  HOWEVER, as some of you may know, the Boston Red Sox are involved in a series of games against the Yankees (who, I am told, Suck).  The victor will get to play in another series of games, probably against the Chicago Cubs.  That series is referred to in the sporting world as the World Series (=world because there is a team in Canada).  It has been brought to my attention that if I don't care about this series of competitions, I am a traitor and will be required to move immediately. Now, what's a girl to do? Well, I have devised a plan that I hope will get me through these troubled times.  I offer them to my corner of the world as possible solutions for this dilemma. 1)  Allow the men (and women) the right to be obsessed.  I have seen the futility of attempting conversation before (and GOD FORBID, during) a game.  It it psychologically impossible for a Red Sox fan to focus on anything else during the "critical window."  2 hours before, 2 hours after and during the game.  The truth is: Go find something else to do, you're not gone succeed with that crowd. 2)  Learn the following phrases:        - Cowboy Up        - Yankees Suck        - Go Sox        - and, if currently unfamiliar:  Home Run, World Series and Baseline hit.   Note:  You do not have to know what these phrases mean.  For example, I do not know what a baseline hit is.  3)  When forced to have a conversation, use these newly learned phrases to sound somewhat knowledgeable.  A few sample comments:  "The Red Sox need to Cowboy up!"  or "I hope they beat the Yankees, they suck!" or, "The Yankees have hit a few serious baseline hits!" or simply, "Go Sox!"  Note:  These comments will fool NO ONE.  These are merely some phrases that make you seem like you give a flying hoot about this series of competitions.  It should ensure that you do not have to flee town. 4) Finally, make jokes.  Mock your own ignorance.   Example:   "You better go or you'll miss kickoff!" "Pedro sure can handle a bat!" "I hope there's a good halftime show!" etc. and finally, 5) Be patient.  There's about a week left in this series. WHEN the Sox win it, there will be about another week  for the WORLD SERIES.  Take heart- baseball will be over in less than a month.  In the meantime, Cowboy Up.

        First Post:  This one is a test- I want to see what happens when my words become public personas.  What do you they look like?  How do they get along with other people's words?  Will they have high profile relationships with celebrity words?  I hope to make this forum a comfortable place for my words.  I am going to call it "Girl Power for the Educated Woman"  I think this has the potential to be a book title someday and I like it.  Anyone who might be reading this can have the following expectations of Uberbliss/Amanda:                  - Vingettes about life: Dating, friendship, dancing and working                  - At least passing reference to NickToons                  - Wisdom. That's right wisdom. Keep an eye on it, I think its gonna be good. Amanda

           Together, Apart: In Andover New Hampshire   This weekend I attended another yoga retreat.  This one took place in Andover, New Hampshire at the Owls Lodge.  This retreat was run by the Dahn Center's Young at Heart Club, interestingly named UDF.  For those of you who went to college with me, you know why this is interesting.  While they are named the United Dahn Frontier, I cannot get over the United Dairy Farmers Peanut Butter and Chip Ice Cream.  Mmmmmmmmmmm.  But I digress.  Because there are no secrets imposed on the contents of Fall Camp like there are on Shim Sung, I will quickly give you a synopsis of what took place and then launch into my existential ponderings on life.    The theme of the weekend was "Where Is The Fun?"  We had some discussion on the way that fun works in life and how there are different levels of fun that have varying and diverse impacts on our life.  For example, some things are fun in the moment (buying a new car and eating some cherry pie) while other things are fun and can change your acceptance of yourself or aid in the attainment of human rights (Shim Sung or lobbying for gay marriage*).  The weekend then revolved around having fun. During the course of the weekend we climbed trees, had a talent show, fed each other, danced and took a hike up the mountain (blindfolded!!).  All in all I would say the weekend was appropriately fun. :) Since I have been thinking about being together with people and separating myself from others to form independence, I was struck by how this dynamic plays itself out in a group setting where there are enough people to be easily together or apart.  And I spent some time watching myself oscilate between feeling drawn towards others and retreating into myself.  There were a lot of people there (I believe the count was 26), from three centers and 2 Dahn clubs.  Therefore there were people who I knew on many points of the intimacy continuum.  People from my center I was very close to, and time spent with them was easy and relaxed and entirely enjoyable.  People who I had met before, I became more familliar with and felt more comfortable with, and then there were people I didn't know at all.  Two of these people were in my team (GO TEAM HARMONY!) and over the course of the weekend I feel like I actually made friends.  Not acquaintances, but friends.  How is that possible? When a group of people, seeminly in the same situation as I come together, what influences the state in which they leave?  What has to take place for them to be friends, what would occur to make them merely sight recognizable?  And why is it that at other times in my life I meet people and don't even remember them later?  This is my theory about how something like A UDF camp makes friends, while other situations make acquaintances.  In a UDF camp we look in each others eyes.  Sometimes we are forced and other times its the natural course of the conversation.  Because we are talking honestly and about often important things its natural to look into the eyes of your conversation partner.  Even the scaredest person will look in the eyes of another when he or she senses that this person needs the eye cotnact to feel safe.   Another important aspect is physical contact.  At a UDF camp (or any retreat probably) you tend to hug.  Hug, hug, hug. When you hug someone and you don't feel the battle within you that you are supposed to pull away first, so as not to appera over eager, you can really feel connected with someone.  And since this is yoga and all the stereotypes point to hugging, one doesn't generally feel too worried about being an overeager hugger.  Also, during one nights exerceises we made a chain of people to see if we could all match up our breathing.  The nature of this chain was that people necesarily had their arms around you- and it felt nice.   Finally, the UDF camp focused on making new connections.  We chose partners we didn't know, we had teams of people we didn't know well and it was encouraged that for each event we talk to the people we didn't know and see what they were about.  You know how at some places its considered very nearly a cardinal sin to put your feet on the table?  The one person who does it, inadvertently, gets a lot of surprised looks, frowns and unspoken condemnation?  At Dahn yoga one is not allowed to prejudge.  You are required to go up and talk to someone before you decide that he or she might be too old/young/good looking/interesting/ or zen to want to know you.  Its very exciting to realize that all kinds of people want to know you.  And that makes you more open to wanting to really know them. This brings me to the end of my theory.   This was a good experience of feeling a togetherness with a group of people.  It was very nice to dance and lay around and get massages from people I didn't really know before.  I can't help wanting to sometimes be alone and block others from my mind, and I was pleased to find that when I returned from my 5-15 minute hiatus, I was still cared for.        P.S. I had ice cream for lunch!

           Changes to Uberbliss/Amanda  I have decided to make a small change, one that most of you who causally read my little website wont even notice.  I am going to focus each week on an idea and see if I can mine my thoughts more deeply and more specifically.  Next week I will continue using the graphic/idea of  Together, Apart  (See below one post).   I am hoping that this will help me with my writing.  I would like to truly come to understand what I think about things.  By watching what I write I can see what moves me to write a lot and what doesn't really interest me to write about at all.  For example, one of my favorite things is God and yet it is very surprising to a lot of my friends to find out that I am at all religious.  People who have known me for years will say "you never told me that!" and I will be surprised.  Similarly, I don't tend to write about it much either.   Perhaps because its private, or because I am so certain, or because I don't want to hear other people's dissenting opinion.  There's no telling. Another example is Nick Toons, another life favorite of mine.  I don't mention them, though I watch them every day.  They exist and they don't necessarily impact the depth of my thoughts (BIG SURPRISE).  Anyway, the moral of my story is that I want to really watch myself and see what I think about, what is easy to write about, what is hard.  And then, subsequently, I can figure out which of the hard topics I need to push myself on (perhaps God) and which of the hard topics are hard just because there is not much to say (Nick Toons).   So, those of you venture here often will see a small,  though significant change.

           Together, Apart  I live in a country where independence is a top priority.  We urge each other to "not let him/her hold you back" and advise "you have to look out for yourself!"  We listen to Christina Aquillera tell us "you can hold us down" and the Dixie Chicks warbling on about Wide Open Spaces.  We want out, we want  up, we want to be on top where no one can reach us.  We seek sucess without the help of others; happiness wihtout the need for companionship. But today I wonder- why?  There is the answer we all know from deep within, where fear has carved a place for itself in our hearts.  To love, to give, to be part of a whole is to risk great pain.  Pain that could, and for many of us has, drive us into the ground.  Pain that could take years to get over and pain that just doesn't seem worth it.  We fear interdependence. But think of the songs that make you CRY every time, or at least the first fifteen times  you heard it.  "When you say nothing at all" by Allison Krauss.  "Candle on the Water," Pete's Dragon.  "All because two people fell in love," some country singer. These are the songs that fill your heart with hope and make you think "Wow, maybe someday I can mean that much, I can be that important.  Maybe someday I will be part of the whole."   And yet, we strive for independence.  We turn others away.  We move away from each other and we get divorced.  I am caught, and I venture to say that my country is caught, in a tug of war.  I want, so badly to matter.  I want to be loved.  I want the sight of me to cause others to smile.  Yet, I want to be free and to be my own person.  You can have it both ways, but I'm not sure how.   In my life I have had many a great person love me.  My family contains nine of the greatest people.  Stefani and Mark.  Jen S and Jenn O.  So, so many people.   And through these interactions and relationships I have become more able to love the world, myself and others.  What have I gotten from turning away the help of others?   There are no answers to these questions that I can think of. They are just the ponderings of November 20th, 2003.

          Babies   Well, its official. I am old, and I am left in the dust.  I very recently found out that a friend of mine, a miss Marni Moore (now Marni Fried, for three years) is pregnant.  This makes her friend number 2, (Following a miss Jenn Bertram, now Jenn Ohs for a year and half) to be pregnant.  That means, for those of you who are unaware, that they are heading down the road towards parenthood.  After roughly nine months of peanut butter and pickles they wil enter labor and exit parents.  PARENTS. I meanwhile, still eat peanut butter out of a jar with a spoon, watch Nick Toons FOR MY OWN SAKE and sleep until 11 regularly. What happened here?   It seems so far away that I might get married and have children.  They both bought houses, have husbands, have yards and probably have joint checking accounts.  I can't imagine buying a  house.  I think about buying a condo in the city.  I can't imagine having a joint checking account and having to explain or GOD FORBID ask for that shopping spree at Barnes and Noble.  And since I haven't had a relationship that lasted over 1 year I don't think I am very likely to have a husband any time soon. I don't know what to think about this whole turn of events.  I mean, if I don't get hitched soon then I wont be of birthing no babies before I am 30 and that wasn't in the plan.  And yet, if some guy came up to me tomorrow and was like "Lets get married and have children" I would think he was crazy!  That is also not in the plan.   Also, just to make myself feel worse, 3 of my unmarried college roommates are on the verge of engagement- within a year I would guess that 2 of them are engaged and if Scott ever gets to it, he and Monica will be MARRIED.  But Scott and Monica have been married inthe eyes of society for the last 5 out of the 12 years they've been together.   What will happen to me when all my friends are married and I am living single?  Oh, I can't think about it anymore.  I am going to go eat ice cream.    Also, most importantly-  CONGRATULATIONS MARNI AND JENN.

           Look Kids, Big Ben   Parliament, Big Ben.  Parliament.  What the hell is this thing? Remember when they couldn't get out of the rotary?  And then got lost in London and spoke Jive on the plane?  Oh, shucks good times.  But did you also notice how incredibly sunny it was in London? Notice how in this picture it is also sunny in London.  In fact, very recently I had a movie weekend where I watched 4 British movies set in London and in each of these movies it was sunny most of the time.  Its not sunny in London, as I understand it.  In fact, when I was there last January (which is the rainiest time of the year, outside of March) it rained every single day.  And I thought, well, its the rainy time.  Then I saw a postcard that hard four pictures of a little blond girl in a "slicker".  Under each picture it said "Summer, In London," "Spring, In London," "Winter, In London," and "Autumn, in London."  So, its not sunny in London.  Then, when I was looking through google image search I saw again hordes of pictures of Big Ben (my favorite London attraction, outside of Hugh Grant) in the sun.  I think they painted their busses bright red to ward off season affective disorder, I think I should have bought a Union Jack umbrella was there (or brally, as they are called) and I think that its amazing that anyone in London has bad skin, what with all that rampant moisture. That's what I think for today.  Adieu.

           THE YAHTZEE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP   This weekend, unbeknownst to many, the International Federation of Yahtzee Lovers hosted the World Yahtzee Championship, right here in Boston!  The tournament featured the top 5 Yahtzee players in the world.  As luck would have it, these top 5 players represetned only three countries!  The United States was represented by a regional Midwest Champion (Amanda Holman), a regional East Coast Champion (Kathryn Phillips).  The country of Hungary was represented by a Buda champion (Balazs Felcsuti) and a Pest Champion (Noemi Razso).  The country of Canada was represented by Russell (Russell does not have a last name, much like Madonna or Pink).  The winner of the competion took home the coveted blue pencil.   The competiion involved one round of general play Yahtzee and one round of double row Yahtzee.  The cumulative score was used to determine a winner.  Play was spirited, competitive and, at times, ruthless.  Our hearts go out to the jailed donkey who suffered immense emotional duress during the competiion.  Play lasted for three hours and ended with an American Victory.  Sparsely beating the Hungarian champion from Buda, the Midwest Champion (AMANDA HOLMAN) was crowned World Yahtzee Champion at 12:00 AM, November 16th.  Congratulations to all players!  To be invited is an honor few attain.

           Letters  There is nothing better, in this age of e-mail and text messaging to go to ones mailbox and find a letter.  Not a bill, or an advertisement or a packet of coupons, but a letter.  Perhaps a letter from one's Grandmother in Ohio, or better, ones Grandfather in Ohio!  Or a Halloween card from one's Mom, or a birthday card from an Aunt.  Or, the best of all, is an overseas letter!  I had never received one of these until my friend Sara went into the Peace Corps and wrote me a letter.  It was full to the brim with news and pictures.  Written in her own handwriting, I was Sara sick.  I wanted her to come home, but not before I got a couple of more letters. I sent some post cards home when I was overseas last year.  I wonder if my family and friends felt similarly.  Reason enough to go back and find out, I say! Nonetheless, a letter in a mailbox is worth three in an e-mail inbox and 5 text messages.  In fact, I am going to go home and write letters to my family and friends, and hoefully they will return the favor.   (Its the weekend and I am going home!  See you on Monday!)

           THE WIDE WORLD   The world we live in, when you get right down to it is as ellusive as one's lifetime.  I will explain.  When, at 25, you think about your lifetime it seems impossible to plan it all.  It seems like it might never end, or else it will end tomorrow in a fiery explosion.  Its rare that we 25 year olds sit and ponder the actual end of our life.  Heart attacks that weaken the immune system that lead to bouts of pneumonia that eventually kill us.  Maybe its better that we not think about it.  :) Regardless, I believe that life goes fast and that its not that much time and that really, we better get to it if we are going to live the life that want to live.   Much like the world.  I love globes, I think they are beautiful and philosophical instruments of peace.  When I look at a globe and see that Australia (though tiny) is considered a continet and that Ohio, the state  is  actually sort of heart shaped, and that peru is really, really long, it hits me strongly that this world is full of people.  People like me in oddly shaped land masses that differ only on their weather patterns and social history.  I do not claim that these differences can be ignored, or that they are trivial in the minds of people.  But it does make me see how similar we all are, despite the differences that we get hung up on.  It makes me want to meet these people and ask them questions.  It makes me frustrated that I can't speak most of their languages.  It makes me yearn to get out of the spot I am in and at least try to understand.  Which brings me to the comment about elusivity.   When we think about the world and we haven't seen much of it, its easy to say "Its too big, there's no way."  Much like planning for an entire life.  But, like life, if we don't get out there and try we could miss it!  And the world is large, but it is also small.  It no longer takes three and a half months on an ocean liner to get to Europe.  It a 6 hour plane ride for 400.00.  And once you've seen one place, I bet you will want to see more.  And then piece by piece you can begin to capture our collective truth.  You can begin to understand.  And if you start now, and you "get on it" then you have a good chance of capturing that truth before your heart attacks begin (I venture to say that your heart will benefit from getting off your fat ass) and your immune system goes and all you have left is waiting for pneumonia.  Just ask the older people in your family (or I'll lend you one of mine)- What you have is a life, what you dont' have is time.  Don't forget to vote on the Uberbliss contest below!

           IT's AN UBERBLISS CONTEST!   Hello, dear readers!  Today we are having the first ever uberbliss.com/amanda contest!  Here's how you play:   First, read through the three stories below.  Two of these stories are true, and one of these stories is false.  You will vote on which one you think is false.  To vote, click at the bottom of the posting, on the word "Comment?."  In this popup box you should enter your name and your e-mail address.  In the actual comments field place the number of your pick for untrue story.  Those of you who guess correctly will receive a fun prize in your e-mail inbox within a couple of days.    Ready?  Here goes!  1) When I was 5 years old Sesame Street came to Houston, Texas to film a pilot for Sesame Street Mexico (called Plaza Sesame).  They were looking for kids to be in this pilot episode and my mother took me and my 6 year old brother to the tryouts.  While my brother was chosen and has gone down in Sesame Street fame, I was not.  At five years old I suffered severe dissapointment.  I hope to get over it soon.  2) When I was a junior in high school I joined the band.  I have no musical talent and can't read music.  I played the cymbals and joined solely to go to Disney World (a band trip planned at the end of the year).  Once I had been in the band for a couple of  months I was asked to lead the (as conductor)band in a rousing Sousa number during a band competition.  I did so and the band was given an award!  3)  When I had my wisdom teeth out in college I had an allergic reaction to the general anesthetic.  During the procedure I came in and out of consciousness and have visions of being kicked in the teeth by a large horse.  Following the procedure I had a bad reaction to the codeine leading to an emergency visit to the dentist to find out that the dentist had stiched my mouth together incorrectly!  A truly miserable experience.   You have three stories, which of them is not true?  The way to think about these is that if it happened, it all happened. If it didn't happen, none of it happened.  There's nothing tricky because i didn't put any tricks in.  Good luck!

           Friday Night  Because I was so bored yesterday I missed the opportunity to tell you about a very fun night.  On Friday night a caravan of lost people stumbled their way into Ipswich to find a hidden theater called the Ipswich moving company.  Every single car got lost.  One person who took the train got lost.  He missed the stop and ended up in Rowley.  In fact, only one person, the other person on the train, made it without incident.  She did however, rely on the kindness of a knowledgeable stranger to aid her in her quest.  Through dogged determination we ended up at the theater, roughly on time and enjoyed the most interesting modern dance show, ever!  A friend of ours JOSHUA MCCAREY was the star of the show (according to  me)!  He danced 3 out of 5  pieces, one of which was a solo.  And not just any solo, a solo that involved hanging from the ceiling by ropes while moving gracefully to the music of Johnny Cash.  Other dances included one that attempted to show how a person can be exposed in society and still be supported and one that explored being in your backyard with your invisible friends.  The last dance was a very beautiful aerial duet in which our hero (Joshua) read sonnets of Shakespeare and swung from ropes.   Following these incredible performance the whole lot of us caravanned (with more success this time) to a place called the Salt Box and enjoyed delicious food and drink.  I had a drink called a fish bowl that reminded me very much of my college days at the Fieldhouse (the bar) where my friends and I drank a concoction out of an actual fishbowl using extremely long straws and became very drunk.  This, however came in a very respectable pint glass with fish painted on it.  During this extremely fun dinner I got more presents (I know, ENOUGH ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY!) including super fun slippers, a gift certificate for a massage and a plethora of caring ad insightful cards.  It was a fantastic way to end my birthday week.   Hooray!

           Bored   My job is boring.  I don't have deadlines, I don't have co-workers, I don't have interesting projects. At least I don't have them now.  I had them (all of them) at different times since I've worked here, but right now I don't have them.  It turns out that I hate to be bored.  I get more headaches when I'm bored.  I take obsessive naps when I'm bored.  I stare blankly into space when I'm bored. This being bored has prompted many a soul search.  Once I was so bored I studied heavily for the LSAT.  Once I got so bored that I took a slew of personality/job related quizzes (What color is your parachute, do what you are, don't waste your talent, etc).   What will happen this time as I get boreder and boreder?   Stay tuned.

           Breaking Out  Wouldn't it be great if you could take a 15 minute break on a sunny, hot beach?  Here' s the scenario:  You are sitting at your desk in the middle of the afternoon- you had pasta for lunch so your eyes are drooping and you're feeling fat.  You want to get up and walk around outside, but its 20 degrees out there or even the 50 degrees it is today.  You feel trapped and irritated, tired and fat.  Then you remember!  You open your top desk drawer and push the red button.  Suddenly you find yourelf on a beach, in Maui, at SUNSET and its 80 degrees.  You are wearing an incredibly flattering sundress and sandals.  There is a beach chair and a margarita and you have fifteen minutes to deconstruct, get relaxed and recharge.  There would have to be some kind of rule that you could only do it once a day or we all know that we would never come back.  Or, how about this?  Same scenario, you are at your desk and tired, fat, irritated because the red button's not working so you push the blue one...... for kicks.  Suddenly you have 15 minutes to spend wandering the back streets of Paris.  Its not as warm, but just as fun!  You turn a corner and see Notre Dame!  Or you think you are deep within the small streets of Paris when suddenly you come across a huge house with an enormous courtyard and an art exhibit open to the public inside.  Or, finally, back at the desk, feeling like you feel, both buttons dont work so you go to the closet and step inside.  Suddenly you are transported to HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZZARDRY and you get to sit in on the care of magical creatures class.  That day, Hagrid is teaching about unicorns and you get to pet it.  Just as you are about to put a spell on Draco Malfoy for being a jerk to poor, misunderstood Hermione you are whisked back to your office.  I think that these would really boost office morale and revolutionize modern physics.  Staples is having an invention contest,  where you give your ideas that will make office work a more reasonable endeavor.  What do you think?  Could I win?

          WRITER'S BLOCK   I have writer's block today.  I am told by the experts (Steven King) that writers block can only be cured with crappy writing.  Keep writing, crap or otherwise. So, today I am going to write crap.  I have written probably 3 beginnings already and I keep getting to the point where I can't think of what else to say, or else I realize that my argument is faulty or I realize that I am falling on convention and I delete the paragraph.   Here's the thing about writing and other creative endeavors, and Amanda Holman.  One of my most charming qualities is that I don't do things that I am not good at... which keeps me from trying new things because I think I might not be good at them (Why else am I still in school?) and I do do things that I am good at.  Writing and other artistic endeavors fall into an elusive and dangerous middle category.  I think that I should be good at them and I think that I could be really good at them if I would just work at it.  And I want to be really good at it, but I hate to fail.  So I am drawn to these activities that intermittently make me feel really good and powerful and then depleted and unable to continue.   Someteimes, I stare blankly at a piece of paper and then blink.  Then I will write something and scratch it out.  And I feel like "Why am I doing this?  Its ridculous, I have other things to do!"  Othertimes I will get on a roll and write something that people comment on and say "Wow that's good!" and I feel great!  Mostly, though I stumble around in mediocrity making obvious comparisons and hoping for enough inspiration to think of some other mediocre comment to make tomorrow.  Luckily for me, I can usually couch my mediocrity in interesting words and jokery and people will enjoy it at least a little.  That tactic made it possible for me to complete my college degree and to some degree my graduate degree. This blog is teetering dangerously close to self-deprecation and comments indicating low self esteem!  I am cutting it off! No more drinks for this blog.  You don't have to go home but you can't stay here. See you tomorow!!

          branded image, please do not sue me    TERRIFYINGLY TRUE TALES  Please, everyone, take a seat.  Something terrifying has happened.  I, Amanda Holman, got back a midterm exam today with a shockingly low grade on it.  SHOCKING!  Lower than a C.  LOWER THAN A C.  You are thinking, "Man that sucks, but terrifying? Not really.  She better not be in charge of organizing a haunted house anytime soon."  However, I haven't told you the terrifying part yet. I   Don't    Care.    AAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Its true.  I don't care.  I didn't cry.  I didn't have a panic attack.  I didn't yell at the teacher.  (I have done all of these in the past for a B). Those of you who knew me in college know that this is true.  In fact, they can probably tell you more about it than I can, what with the resulting fatigue that follows a panic attack or a crying bout or the detention that comes from full on yelling at a teacher.  (that's an interesting story, actually.  I think she enjoyed it.....)  Here's what I can  make of this anomalous behavior.   1) its still possible to get a B of some sort in the class, and I have close to 100% on the homework.   2) I have realized that my self worth is not defined by school...... so long as I can get a B in the class and have 100% on the homework (that was a joke). 3) I have realized that my teacher is a bit of a bad teacher and wrote a terribly confusing test, so its at least a little bit his fault. 4) I didn't study, so I was prepared for mediocrity. 5) I have honestly concluded that this masters degree, though interesting and educational is a means to an end.  My career as a life long student is ending soon.... well, its going to go on a nice long sabbatical, anyway.  I want to work in children's television and to that I just have to do it. 8) Nick Toons don't care what I got in Marketing research....... so long as I'm not their research director.

          3A Takes Boston by Storm Blue Man Never the Same   This weekend, as many of you may know- two of my college roommates came to visit.  I picked friend 1 (Miffie) up at the airport at 10PM on Thursday evening and friend 2 (Monnie) drove into town the  next morning.  My two other college roommates were not able to come (Jen and Sara) but they were there in Spirit.  It is one of my long term goals for this here website to have digital pictures available for you to see what I do and how I do it, but for today you will have to use your imagination.  On Friday morning Miffie and I went to procure pancakes at the local deli.  I had some gorgeous french toast topped with strawberries and bananas.  Miff had french toast with strawberries and I believe she enjoyed it.  Following this foray into culinary delight, Miff and I walked through Coolidge Corner to the party shop to browse n' buy Halloween costumes.  I bought a hot pink and black feather boa and some horns.  Miff bought an enormous, two foot high beehive wig.  It was fantastic. We returned to my apartment and welcome Monnie to Boston.  She arrived at approx. noon. That afternoon we battled traffic to Salem, MA and walked through the madness that prevails in Salem during the last 2 weeks in October (Haunted Happenings).  I bought a magic wand from the Salem Witches Education Association.  So far no luck making my laundry do itself.  Will keep you informed.  The 3A girls then battled back through traffic to Boston, climbed into our Halloween costumes (makeup, clothes, boots, beehives) and trooped off to the Birch Street Bistro in Roslindale to eat great food and super wine with one of my favorite waiters, Joshua McCarey.  He was dressed as the Cowardly lion, but the way he handled plates was anything but cowardly!  He was not our waiter so we were able to watch him without bias.  While at the Bistro we also saw Char Ann who was there visiting her son (also one of my favorite waiters) with her husband and friend.  Then Lisa who showed up to see her boyfriend who is also Char Ann's son.  Confusing?  Maybe.  Stay with me. We polished off 2 bottles of wine,I ate duck for the first time (I tried not to have visions of donald or daisy or Hewey) and then had desert.  Very good food at the Bistro.  I suggest you go there and eat.  After we ate, we packed into the car and headed downtown to hang out at Lansdowe Street.  We wanted to go to Jillians but there was a wait.  So we went to Jake Ivories instead.  Some guy bought us beer because we looked bored so we danced to look less bored.  Shortly thereafter we went home.   Saturday morning we rose and scooted off to   Sorellas for breakfast. I had a delicious omelet and Monnie and Miffie both had pancakes.  Following our late breakfast/lunch we drove to the Tstop and went to walk down Newbury street.  We walked down Newbury street until I had to run away an d go to a yoga appointment. They met me after my appointment and we down to the North End to eat dinner and then go see the blue men.  Dinner was a bit frustrating, as there was no where to eat in the North End without a 2 hour wait.  So we had pizza at Panino XP and then headed off to the show.  I wont tell you anything about Blue Man.  EXCEPT to say that I gave him the candy bar. OH YES I DID. On Sunday we woke up and ate donuts while watching Identity (SO WEIRD). At about 1 we had a birthday cake and presents party since all three of us had birthdays.  Then, we took Miffie to the airport and Monica and I lapsed into longwinded conversation that lasted until about 8 when she was forced to leave.   All in all a super fun visit and I am glad for it! Thank you Monica and Miffie for coming to visit me!!

           After Christmas Festivities   On Christmas day my family all got together for lunch and dinner and presents.  My brother got me a fabulous camera and I got some money from other members of the family.  It was a very nice day and I was very glad to spend time with the whole gang together.  On Christmas day I came to Sandusky with my brother!  He has had to work, but I have spent the last day with his fiance' and we made jewelry.  She is much, much better at it than I am. I make very obvious patters with the beads and they look,  in the end, big and cluncky or just obvious.  Hers are beautiful.  She is very artisitic in general, in fact she made all of her Christmas presents, and some of the presents were shink wrapped, which I was very impressed with.   But, after we made jewelry all day (While we were making jewelry we watched Pride and Predjudice!!!) we went to eat dinner at TGI Fridays and then came back and watched XMen2.  It was a pretty good movie, I'll admit.  Today we are going to the Mall to see if there is anything for me to wear to New Years Eve in NYC!  I hope I can find a nice shiny blue shirt because some of the jewelry I made was with black and blue stones.   I hope you are all having fabulous after Christmas activities!

          Merry CHRISTMAS!!  I am sitting at my Grandparents house on Christmas Eve and we are having pizza and apple salad for dinner.  I made the apple salad and my Grandma made the pizza- well I think Mama Rosa made the pizza but my Grandma put them in the oven.  I got here last night at midnight- 2 hours past when I should have gotten in.  I was "redirected" through Cleveland adding 2 hours onto my trip.  For my trouble I got a free flight anywhere in the continental US! So, irritating but it could have been worse.   I am thinking about going to Mass with my Aunt Theresa.  And tomorrow my brother and his FIANCE are coming.  Then we are having lunch and dinner and presents and Christmas cheer!  Hooray! All's well in Lima Oh!

          Back In Action!  I'm back!  After a week's Hiatus, I am back on uberbliss.  Its been a hectic week of end of semester work.  Alls well that ends well, and I am glad to say the semester ended pretty well.  Hooray! The next 2 weeks should be pretty awesome- I am going home to visit my family from the 23 to the 28 and then I get New Years Day and that Friday off so I have another super long weekend around New Years!  If Lucy will really have me, I am going to NYC for the New Year!  I am very excited!  I made a pact with myself that I would enjoy the Holidays as much as finals and my financial situation would let me.  So I am pumped about going to New York and Home.   Holidays, for college students and gradute students the world over, are always cast in the shadow of final papers and projects.  Finally you get your work done and BOOM its the week before Christmas and you have to scramble to buy and wrap presents and before you know it, its New Years.  I knew that this is what its like, but this year I tried to spend more time actually enjoying the Holidays.  I was only moderately successful, but its a step in the right direction.  Once I am done with school, think of all the fun I will have! Well, I have to get things wrapped up in the office so that I can leave without conscience for a whole week! I will update this as regularly as I can from home and Ohio!

           Inner Joy and Purpose   Taking a break from importing PowerPoint slides at work, I am pondering the connection between inner joy and purpose.  It seems to me that it is nearly impossible to be very joyful when you have no purpose.  And almost as impossible to be purposeful with no joy.  You always hear about people who are "doing what they love" and they "never get tired" and they "could work/play all night."  You also hear about people who full of spunk and spirit, make others feel good, and are fun to be around.  Don't these seen to be the same people?   When I use the word purpose, I don't mean necessarily that these people are on a great career path or that they are off to joining the Peace Corps and save the world. I mean, merely, that they have a solid sense of who they are and what they are doing "here."   According to DahnTrine, one has to have a purpose or she is wasting  her energy.  Apparently, energy likes purpose.  It will flow towards an identified purpose and you will feel healthier.  Since the mind and the body are inexplicably linked, the energy flow will also make your body feel better.  This probably has something to do with this phenomenon as well. Realistically, finding one's PURPOSE is like finding a needle lying around in a drug detox ward (They aren't allowed).  So, the question remains, how can you find today's purpose so that you can find today's joy?  How to shrug off the chronically revisiting feeling that you are living waiting to die?  That feeling that creeps in when feel like today you are doing what you did yesterday which you will do tomorrow and who cares?  How do you infuse this day with purpose and thus the joy of accomplishment?   Today I feel very joyful and I feel like things I do are purposeful.  I am not smiling overmuch, I am not laughing wildly, but I feel joy.  I also feel like the world is worthwhile and that I can accomplish things.  Somehow, I have found today's purpose.  I hope I can harvest this feeling and spread it more to the few days when I feel gray and bored and generally overwraught.   Today's thoughts.

           School?  What School?   There are two weeks left to school and I have a final exam to prepare for, a final project to prepare and final paper to not only write, but to do the research for.  What do I do?  I go out to eat and take naps and watch the Cosby Show.   Ah, procrastination.   However, its exciting to think that I will be done with my degree and for all I know SCHOOL FOREVER in 6 months. What could the world offer me, post school?  I am gonna find out!  But not right now because I have to get enough work done that I don't feel bad finishing up a project for school here at work.

        Working from Home:   Since my boss is away at Disney WOrld, I am working from home today.  I have to learn FrameMaker for a project and so I am home with the laptop.  Its hard to focus.  I have done dishes, fell asleep, took a walk and have still gotten in some time on the computer.  I still have three of four hours to get in for an honest day, so I have to go and do that!  Its very likely that my posts will be unpredictable for the next 2 weeks while I write papers and work on final projects.

           Working While the Boss is Away   As nice as it is to have the boss gone to Disney World, its hard to be the only person in the office!! I want to talk to someone and there's no one here!  And the person I used to write e-mails to next door at the other office is gone, moved to Illinois!  Its lonely at Mass Par!  And being lonely is second only to being bored for making me sleepy!  What happens when you combine bored and lonely?  You get me with droopy eyes and large yawns.  Too sleepy for stringing together sentences- hope to have more to say tomorrow! Amanda

           Thanksgiving Vacation   The Uberbliss Hiatus   Thanksgiving had an unexpected effect on this webiste.  I thought that my friend, who I went to visit would have internet access and I would be able to update daily and even write something fairly lengthy at the end of the week.  Alas, I did not.  Instead I laid around on the couch, petted the dog and watched countless episodes of the Simpson season 3 on DVD.  All in all it was quite nice!    Last week I was thinking a lot about the human need for connection and the human desire for independence.  There's no time like Thanksgiving to bring clarity to these kinds of ideas.  This is my attempt at clarity.  When I began thinking about independence I found myself trying to justify why independence seems to be the opposite of connection.  Independence after all is being able to stand in the world on your own two feet.  The absence of a crutch, especially a financial crutch, is implicit in my definition of independence.  Why, then should connection be considered the opposite of independence.  I cannot see anywhere in the definition of independence where connection stands in opposition.  Except, tellingly, in the absence of a crutch.  Perhaps those of us striving madly for independemce, somewhere deep inside, consider having connections with other people to be a crutch.  And what necessarily follows is that one must eliminate all crutches since the goal is to stand only on one's own two feet.   Think of a person standing on a frozen, barren hillside.  The wind blows and the person sways dangerously, but does not fall.  That person has only him or herself to credit for not falling.  Despite the cold, the person believes they are doing something worthwhile.  Imagine now that this same person is standing on a hillside with another person.  The wind blows and they grab each other.  Neither falls and they find how much warmer it is when they stand together.  Who, though is responsible for the fact that they are still standing?  And more importantly, who cares, since finally they are warm?   This is the way it is.  In trying to stand on our own to feet, facing the wind alone,mining the depths of our inner strength, we can turn away the warmth that comes from being near another person, who might, while standing next to us, help us to remain standing.   And, I believe we do this with the best intentions.  Its often that we try to stand alone because we don't want to bother others.  For example, my common thoughts are "I don't want to bother others with this wind, its not their responsibility." or "No one wants to bear this wind, its too cold." Another concern is that the people you let into your life might be a little crazy and you think, "If someone else bears my wind, I might have to bear there's and what if I can't handle it?"   These are all honest concerns that translate into (I HOPE) a lack of understanding about the human condition and ill placed protection.  If other people are like me, then they want to know people for who they are.  I want to stand in their wind and hear real emotion in their voices and see real laughter in their smiles.  I don't want to see the person they can dress up in shiny shoes and parade around.  Shiny shoes girl takes care of the details, makes sure everyone's having a good time and engages other people when she can sense they are feeling down.  I have that person, and she's nice and I like her but she only gives and she is not open to receiving.  Therefore, the only people who are attracted to her for a long period of time are the ones who suck the life out of you, one shiny shoe at a time.   This leads us to the issue of ill placed protection.  This paradigm is somewhat circular, in that when you don't open up to people, yet want desperately to be open to others, you end up being open to primarily life suckers.  Then, you are even less open to others seeing who you are (since your experience with people in the world is that they aren't really able to handle anything) and shiny shoes girl takes over a little more of your public persona.  You also begin to have thoughts like " I can't do this anymore, people are crazy! I can't take on any one elses craziness!" and so you protect against all people. This is, as I said, ill placed protection.  Somehow you gotta break the cycle and reach out to people who are, seemingly, sane.  You really can tell the sane ones from the crazy ones as long as you try.  Having sane friends is the way to protect yourself against people who suck the life out of you.  This is getting off the subject, but I think it helps me to understand how a person can focus so much on standing upright, and so much less on being warm. All of this insight has come to me over a really long time.  A lot of this, to a lot of people, could seem like common sense.  But to me they were blockades to my happiness.  I let these fears and my attraction to crazy people to keep me isolated from really great people.  The upside is that I know that I can stand on some pretty windy hillsides alone and be alright.  But I am at the point now that I want to be warm.  Almost more than I want to be any stronger.   So perhaps this is the way it works.  As a person becomes stronger , the more capable she is to be alone. From this standpoint, she knows that she can be alone and it wont be bad, in fact it can sometimes be really gratifying!  This is when she needs to change directions and learn how to connect.  Offering some strenght in return for some warmth.  Little by little some balance could emerge and true happiness could be found.  This is my hope, anyway, as I stand on my hillside cautiously beckoning people up. In summary, I think that the human being knows when her path towards a goal needs to be altered.  When I reached the point that I was as strong and alone and cold as I would every be able to credit myself more I started moving towards a goal of connection.  This has brought up some feelings of dissonance.  Through thinking and working it out, I have come to realize that I have to change my definition of connection from a crutch, to a source of warmth.  We would dismiss thoughts such as "I should do myself to live without the sun!" as ludicours!  And so I will try to dismiss such thoughts as "I should try to live without others" as equally ludicrous.  The fact that people can also prop you up in their efforts to stand tall is just an added, amazing benefit. Enough for today.  Back to FrameMaker.

          My Friends   Yesterday, my friend Monica and I were talking about friendship.  Monica and I operate under the same set of friendship rules.  The number one rule is that friendship is not something you take lightly.  It's something you have to work at sometimes, and its a life commitment.  I, like Monica, choose my friends very carefully.  I am often very hesitant to make friends, and once I do make friends, its very rare that I lose touch with those people.   My best friends: Sara, Jen, and Monica from college; Jen from graduate school- these are the people that I know, no matter what, I can depend on them.  I have other friends- some of whom may enter this league of extraordinarly gentlewomen- and I value them too.  You can take a look at the long list of people I consider good friends from the blog on friendship from October 28th.  Every single one of these people and I have had some sort of fall out (well maybe not Jen Oh's, but we probably will) and have grown from it.  Talking about why we were upset, once internal boiler died down, and realizing more about each other and ourselves in the process- that's a big part of what friendship is, to me.   I am so grateful for my friends- there are times when I wonder how on earth I got along before Monica or Jen or Jen or Sara.  Their familliar senses of humor, their diverse wisdom on life and their willingness to let me sleep on their couch whenever, under whatever circumstances.  They are family to me.   Its hard when you make friends that you think could be life friends, and then something happens.  I had a friend I made in graduate school in Illinois, who I thought had the potential to be my best friend ever.  When she decided that she couldn't be friends with me anymore, I think it broke my heart.  I felt betrayed and abused and to be honest, shocked!  I have had extremely good luck with friends, I've never really been betrayed.  It took me a while to get over it, and made me wiser about life.  Even this traumatic experience made me realize how lucky I am to  have people in my life who are always there for me-  even though they are in California, Connecticut, Africa and Pennsylvania.  They all called me and told me that anyone who would give up being friends with me was crazy, sent me cards, sent me a chicken (long story, maybe for tommorrow!).  I love my friends, all of them, old and new.  But I am especially grateful for the ones who have shown that through thick and thin, screaming matches and long distances, they are rock solid.

          What I Don't Understand   Could clearly fill a book, but here's one that has stumped me for ages.  If I say to someone "I am going to call you tonight at 8:00" and I forget, I am all apologies.  That's my word.  If I say, "I am taking Grandpa's present over tonight," I do it!  When I say, "Let me see what I can do," I see what I can do.  And when I don't, because I am NOT PERFECT, I apologize.  I realize that other people depend on me. I realize that people make plans based on what I tell them.  I realize that when I cancel or pull a no-show, I am screwing up other people's days/nights.  And no, maybe its not significant.  And maybe most of the time they don't care, but sometimes it is, and sometimes they do.  I can't imagine caring so little for other people's plans and lives and being so self involved that my slightest inclination to not do something takes precedent over the disapointment of others. Now, I realize that every single one of us has to change plans sometimes.  But I know people who do this shit all the time.  My mother breaks her plans with my grandparen't nine times out of the ten time's I hear that she's made them.  When I was home for Christmas, I saw her one time.  ONCE.  On Christmas day.  The other two plans we had she cancelled- one to see her boyfriend, who is so despised that he isn't welcome to family gatherings, and once to go to a party.  A PARTY.  I'm home for 5 days, and she goes to a party.  Bullshit. And I know other people who are likely change plans but have realized their tendency and at least have learned not to make plans.  These are the people who will say things like, "I'm not sure, let me see what's going on that day" etc.  I respect that, truly.  Even these people, though, need to recognize that when they make concrete plans, they can't just up and not keep them because they don't feel like it.  Recognizing and admitting a problem does not make that failing OK.  I just feel like so many people are so wrapped up in their own drama that they can't see how their life affects other people.  We are not isolated creatures.  We are people, part of a culture, that is individualistic enough already.  When people depend on us, which for some people (like me) is very difficult to do, we have to recognize that our lives are not only our own.  Part of being a good person is being dependable.   The following is a disclaimer- those of you who have ever cancelled plans with me, do not think I am sitting over here sticking pins in a doll that looks suspicously like you.  I understand life is complicated and my needs/wants etc. are not the center of the world.  This is more about people who make a habit of cancelling and being flaky and being generally self involved.

        DREAMS   Lately, I have begun dreaming again. For awhile I had stopped dreaming, or at least I wasn't remembering my dreams.  Then, I had a series of dreams about my friends, in bizarre situations, and suddenly I'm dreaming again.  I have had dreams about being friends with Britney Spears, my current friends, owning a dog, going to Sundance... its crazy.  I think that it comes from sleeping too much, because I will often wake up at exactly 8 hours after I went to sleep and then go back to sleep.  That's when I dream.  I am not complaining- it keeps things interesting.  But its odd.  It kind of makes me want to buy one of those dreams interpreted books, and learn all about my psyche... then again, ignorance is bliss.

           Tax Returns....   Today I finally got my other tax return (for the first time in my tax filing history, I only have 2 tax returns to file!!!) and I filed my taxes.  LIFE IS GOOD!  Its the first significant contribution to the Amanda Abroad fund and boy is it significant!  I couldn't believe the magnitude of my refund!  Hooray!  I am so excited! Speaking of money, I am thinking about getting a 2nd job, maybe at a club for one night a week.  Just so that I can manage to save a little more money and stop being completely broke once a  month.  And I don't want to get into the habit of borrowing from my Europe money, because I will need every drop of it once I get there, I'm sure.   All's well on this sleepy Saturday.  I am reading magazines and looking at pictures, and mocking people who are on the street in the 11 degree weather. HA HA!

          The Worst Relationship   Once upon a time I had a boyfriend, who started out normal-ish and turned out to a lunatic.  His lunacy was so subtle and manipulative that it was undetectable until I was sucked into the web.  He was the kind of guy that used passive agressive warfare with innocence.  He acted like the wrong answer to his passive agressive question woulld set him so far over the edge that he could break.  Eventually I was so on edge, and so tense that I would burst into tears in church, on the T, and at work, just so that I could keep it together when we were together.  This made me realize that I  needed to end the craziness.  The breakup was messy and took two tries, one of which involved me sneaking into his house and taking my things so as not to have another riotous breakup scene.  Needless to say, that didn't go over well, and I was bombarded with voicemails and e-mails and craziness.  It died down eventually, but I was/am scarred.  I haven't had a real, emotionally fulfilling relationship since.  But that's not the point. Here's the point.  He and I got together on New Years and for Valentines day, he made me a CD with love songs on it.  The very first song on this Valentine's, celebrate our new love CD had the following lyrics:  Don't fall in love with me yet  We only recently met  True I'm in love with you but  you might decide I'm a nut  Give me a week or two to  go absolutely cuckoo  then, when you see your error,  then, you can flee in terror  like everybody else does  I only tell you this cause  I'm easy to get rid of  but not if you fall in love  Know now that I'm on the make  and if you make a mistake  my heart will certainly break  I'll have to jump in a lake  and all my friends will blame you  There's no telling what they'll do  It's only fair to tell you  I'm absolutely cuckoo  NOW- who misses this kind of sign?  It was the first song on the CD.  THE FIRST SONG.    I liked the music, and I usually skipped through the first song because it was disturbing.... and yet.  The problem was that as terrible as I felt, It was also the most I have ever felt for someone.  It makes me wonder if I am destined to be loved by and love the crazy people.  If so, then I think I prefer to keep things as they are- me- alone.

           Joshua in Spain   My friend Joshua has landed in Spain and has already made a little life for himself.  He has an apartment (with a couch!) and has started working with a theater company and taking language classes.  I am so happy for him, and he gives me hope!  The picture above is the church in Santiago de Compastela, which many a pilgrim has set as his or her destination.  He says its breathtaking!  He recently did a video where he played a penis. I think that sounds grand. :)   I too am planning to do about three weeks of language school once I get to Spain, and I amuse myself for hours with wondering where I will go for language school and how much I might pay and how long I might stay, and then where I  might go afterwards.  I have visions of August in Ireland and September in Italy.  That really leaves July on the 4 month plan for travelling through France, Hungary, UK, etc.  It feels like such a long time, and yet so short!  What an adventure!  I seem to have overcome the feelings of being overwhelmed and have moved into being really excited and open to whatever comes.  Fabulous!

           GIRLS NIGHT!  This weekend was really fun!  On Friday night a group of girls (Monica, Katy, Cara, Kristin, Christine, Amanda, and I) went to eat at Fajitas and Ritas and then saw Along Came Polly.  I know that the movie got mixed reviews (I loved it, how you could you not love Ben Stiller?) and some of the others thought it was gross, but I think that everyone  had fun at the girls night!  It was nice to just get togethe with women, none of whom knew each other, and hang out.  It was a fun night of getting to know each other and drinking Margaritas!   After the movie Katy gave us a ride home, and Monica stayed with me on Friday night.  Saturday, she and I hung out until about 4:30 doing lunch, going grocery shopping, and what not, and it was really nice to see her.  She and I decided that we would get together every other Month until I leave for Europe, which will be great, because its so easy to just not take advantage of the people who are near in geography to  you.  I wish more of my college friends were closer to me! Saturday night I wanted to go out but I just couldn't bring myself to... Instead I stayed in, took a bath, laid around and watched "till there was you" Not a great movie, truth be told.   Sunday I went to the gym and then to a football party and the Patriots won!  I was surprisingly excited. Then I met up with Katy for Thai food (Still nothing to compare to my La Joya thai food in NYC) and then she hung out for a little bit and watched some of Seabisquit, which I finished watching after she left.  Also not a great movie, but better than Till there was you.   On Monday I sort of felt out of sorts.   I was hit with a wave of loneliness that was partly related to the weather, and partly some melancholy about being alone (Aka boyfriendless) and I got exactly the cure I needed- dinner with Katy and Char Ann (BOOKCLUB!) who I told that I was feeling lonely.  As tears welled up in my eyes, I began immediately to feel less lonely.  I guess part of the loneliness was having no one to tell that I was lonely.  Once I said it, I felt a lot better.  Then, after bookclub I went to Bruces and watched 3 episodes of SEX AND THE CITY, which was fabulous.  Bruce is always a good place to turn for good clean fun.  We watched the first two season episodes On Demand and then watched this week's episode on HBO for real.  SO GOOOOOD.  Miranda is married!   Overall, a very good weekend, but I am glad to be at work!  Today I got my review and it was good!  I also got a raise and a new title!  My new titile is "Project Coordinator" and my boss told me that should Europe not work out I get to stay for as long as I want.  Assuming I don't commit any felonies.  Which seemed fair.  Europe will work out, but it was nice to hear.   Well, I got to get to work, but I'm glad to be back on Uberbliss- who will chronicle my fascinating life if I don't?

           The weeks end   Holy moly- what a week.  Its been a good one- back to life; back to reality.  Today I have had some unexplainable happiness.  I got the bulk of my work done and have been listening to CDs, writing e-mails, doing the minor small things that I need to do so I only have to work Sunday (not Sat and Sun), and I have been light hearted all day.  Hooray! Tonight I am going to watch Sex and The City episodes that my friend who has HBO taped for me!  Hooray!  I am watching it with "the girls-" no boys allowed! Last night I had dinner at Char Ann's house- it was fabulous and fat free!  We had fried chicken, mashed potatos with heavy cream and butter galore and some carrots.  She had all the food done at the exact same time.  I tell you, that takes cullinary genius!  Today for lunch I had oatmeal- that does not take cullinary genius, but it was too damn cold (2 DEGREES!) to go next door and heat up my soup.  We have one of those hot water/cold water coolers that people are supposed to stand around and tell jokes at (except I would have to stand and laugh at my own jokes, since I don't have any coworkers, only a boss) that will work for oatmeal. Can you tell I'm hungry? Looking forward to a fun weekend- hope you are too!

        Europe   It occurred to me yesterday that I had not made an official announcement on my website about my big plans.  This is a grievous error, and only partly an oversight.  I am often so nervous about what will happen once I am there that I didn't want to commit or tell the "world" until I was completely sure.  All of my friends know anyway, but it seems more official to make a proclamation.  But, I realize that I cannot pass up this opportunity and so I proclaim:  At the end o May, once I graduate with my masters degree, I am going to move to Europe for 6 months.  I will be in Spain for three, brushing up on my Spanish, and then travelling around for three months.  It is no coincidence that Joshua is in Spain now, since he is my inspiration and my beacon.    We are under strict deadline at work right now, so that's all I can afford to say right now, but I promise to wax poetic about it later!

           Contemplation  I watched Kissing Jessica Stein last night, a movie for interesting contemplation.  I also have a cough and a headache (I think unrelated) and am busy at work.  According to my Dr. Seus calendar "If you want to catch beasts you don't see every day. You have to go to places quite out of the way."  Since I am planning to go to Europe this May, I am taken with the quote, and under the duress of cough syrup and advil, my imagination runs away.  How then, am I still ahead of schedule at work? Boy am I tired, and if it weren't cold outside, then I would go get a cup of tea.  This is why I need to live where its warm.  Contemplation with no direction.  That's all I have today.

          New Year Resolutions: -  I am giving up sweets until Easter. -  I am going to have a cardio workout 4 times/week (indluding early morning dance party). -  I am going to really enjoy the 6 months left to my time in Boston.  All resolutions are good until May, when things will change so much that I might need to revise these.  :)

           New York New Years  Back in Boston, back on uberbliss, back to work.  The holidays are over!  I spent the most recent installment of holiday-ness in New York City visiting my friend Lucy who has recently moved there (September).  We did not go to Times Square, which was both good and bad.  Good because it would have been cold and crazy.  Bad, because by now it would be over and I would have been able to say I've done it.  Instead, we went to the Mercury Lounge for a show with a band called Luna that was very fun.  After the show we got in a cab to try to get to Times Square to see what was left of the festivities down there, but realized halfway there that nobody wanted to go there, all we really wanted to do was go home and sleep.  So, we went back to Brooklyn and went to bed.  The next day Lucy made a fabulous brunch and had some friends over, which was very fun. We played Taboo and ate lots of food.  When the last of the friends left we took naps and then went to see a movie.   When we got to the movie house we found out that it was sold out so we got tickets to the 10:00 and went to have dinner.  We ate dinner at the worlds best Thai restaurant- La Joya in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.  I had the very best spicy noodles I have ever had.  It was so incredibly good- I can't get over it! Then we went and saw Big Fish, which by the way, is fabulous.  The movie got over around midnight and we went to bed right after.  This brings us to Friday when 2 friends of mine from Boston (Katy and Paul) came down and we went dancing in Manhattan!  This was my first time going dancing in New York and it was fun, but I think there were more tourists there than New Yorkers, which suited me, the tourist, fine.  A guy got my phone number and that was fun, but I hope he doesn't call.  He lives with his mother and was grossed out by the fact that I was sweaty.  Right.  Who gets sweaty dancing like a maniac for four hours?  EVERYONE.  Anyway, it was fun that he got my number. :)  By this time I was ab-so-lutely exhausted.  I didn't sleep very well that night because I was sharing a bed with someone which I am not used to doing and woke up on Saturday even more tired.  So, my friends and I went out to breakfast and then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge (Nice views, and not too cold since it was 50 degrees) and that was nice, but it only made me tireder.  This is the day I had to make it home on the Commuter Rail/Car trip to Boston and my exhaustion was extreme.  Once we got back to Lucy's I had to lie down for 30 min  to recharge enough to pack my stuff and feel up to walking to the Subway.  So I did and then got lost on the Subway, which was enough to almost make me cry.  Then I made it to Grand Central in time to make my train and made it to New Haven where Monica came to collect me.  Monica and I went to get something to eat and then I had to drive home to Boston in a RAINSTORM!  Needless to say I got home at about 10 and went immediately to bed.  Following this night of sleep (Approx. 12 hours) I went to brunch with Joshua- my last time to see him before he leaves to Spain on Tuesday :( and then I went home and slept until about 6, when I went to Char Ann's for dinner.  Whew.  Now, as I said I am back to work and back to life.  My happy web page will be updated daily again and all is well.  One more post today- the public proclamation of my New Years Resolutions, and then back to work!

          Weekend and Work   Its been a full week and I haven't blogged- I am working at a hotel without e-mail access and I haven''t really hit on the idea of typing the blogs while I am there and then sending them when I get home. Oh hey, I can type the blogs while I am there and send them when I get home!  A solution.   Last week, this week and next week I am working on site- which means I get up at 5AM to be to work at 6:30/7:00.  This is very hard on me as I am not a morning person and even now- at 9:10 PM I am 10 minutes past my bedtime.  Its hard to go to bed at 9.  I am bored all day and that doesn't suit me too well either.  But I got a spanish language course and I am looking forward to brushing up the Spanish I have so that I ccan practice my Spanish by watching telemundo and eavesdropping on the old guys at Dunkin Donuts.  This weekend I had a friend in from College.  He and I hadn't seen or really talked since about 7 years ago, and it was nice to talk and get to know each other again and debunk old myths.  This was an especially important and enlightening part, since there were some pretty powerful myths in place.  I will speak more on this in a more specific blog tomorrow.  Its now quarter past 9, so my sleep time is slipping away.  I will do my best to blog again tomorrow, and until then, Au revoir.

          Bedtime Magic with David Allen Boucheat    I can’t stand to fly.  I’m not that naïve.  I’m just out to find the better part of me.     Is there any more powerful word than I or me?  Who else but humans can explain themselves as individuals?  Who else can see, and mourn, and feel proud of way he or she is?  What a difference it makes to be able to say “It’s not easy to be me.”  Think of this!  This requires and understanding oneself, a context within which to compare, and an internalization of the agreed upon meaning of easy, AS WELL AS a filter that allows you to make this statement despite the societal to “stand up,” “be a man,” “take responsibility”!    I think most of us would agree that it’s hard to be Superman.  But what about you and I?  Is it easy to be us?  Can we get to the point that easy is an uncontextualized adjective and we can all say that it’s not easy to be me?  Or are we doomed to compare ourselves and fret until we have achieved a hard enough time to say that OBJECTIVELY, its no easy to be me?   Because when you think about it, it’s the “me” that it’s not easy to be.  Knowing ourselves as unique while having the ability to take the role of other is what makes being a cognizant, thinking human being hard.  So, really it’s never easy to be “me.”     I still want you in my life, just to help me dry the tears that I’ve cried.  And I’m sure gonna give you a try.  If you want I’ll try to love again but I know……..   The first cut called me yesterday.  He is coming to Boston for a meditation retreat.  He broke the hell out my heart, and until I met Michael Huppe who refractured it while making me feel badly about myself, he was the worst thing that ever happened to me.  This is the one you’ve all heard about, who dated my roommate?  Yes, that one. He is coming, he is staying with me.  What to think? Monica and I had a long conversation where I cursed out all the parties involved including the first cut, the roommate and my arch enemy, Felicia.  Felicia was the one who not only told the roommate that I slept with the first cut (which I hadn’t, I hadn’t slept with anyone!!) but also the person who told this ridiculous story to my to-be boyfriend’s friends, prompting them to tell my to-be boyfriend that I was a slut, and beware!  Oh, college.  What a mess. Anyway, the first cut.  I wonder how much of an effect he had had on the subsequent boyfriends.  The way things ended, I don’t believe he ever cared about me, he was (and is, if the roommates accounts are true) a man of convenience.  And I am nothing if not inconvenient.  I was always going through some kind of drama, while becoming me. And since my life is dedicated to become me in all my glory, I continue to go through drama.  Every other boyfriend found it charming- until he didn’t.  And when he didn’t I just went ahead and said goodbye.  But the first cut.  Man oh maneshevitz (as my friend Alisa says), I would have sat around being inconvenient to him forever.  At that time I was so amazed that someone like him would even look at someone like me* that I couldn’t bring myself to realize how bad his need for convenience was for me.  Luckily, I wasn’t the person who sat around for 5 years waiting for him to be a decent human being, the roommate was.   I don’t know why he would want to come and see me, I can only hope that he had something worthwhile to say for himself.  He sounded nervous on the phone….. I will keep you updated. *This was really when I realized the power of presentation.  When you present like “someone like that” then everyone will want you to see them.  It has nothing to do with what you look like or how you dress.  It really has everything to do with the confidence you present.  So now I present with confidence.. You should try it, it makes everything easier!   Oh, thinking about all our younger years.  There was only you and me. We were young and wild and free.   Loving is all that I need Is isn’t too hard to see we’re in heaven Once in your life you find someone…. Our love will light the way  No wonder we are all so unsatisfied.  How on Earth are we supposed to find someone who is all that we need??? Its not possible for one person to be all that we need!  No wonder there are so many songs about lying on the floor crying your eyes out, or the Christina Aquillera version (much more kind of ) “You’ve made that much stronger, made me work a little bit harder, made me that much wiser, thanks for making me a fighter.”  Who wants to be a fighter?  No one!!  We want to find that someone who fulfills all our needs, loving is all we need!  We want a love that will light the way.  What we get is love that makes the light do funny patterns through the cracks.   You know what I want?  Seriously?  Someone who makes me laugh.  Someone who thinks that my needs matter.   Someone who wants to run away with me.  Someone who will love me… and someone who can make me realize it. Someone who will ask for help when he needs it.  Someone who makes me laugh.  God, to laugh is divine.  I don’t want my hopes to fade away…. I want to realize what it means to say “why don’t you stay…” and mean it.   And honestly, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if I can’t have THAT, I don’t want anything else.   What others mean to me   Is it me or are we all going around creating sentences with the languages that we have learned but when analyzed by a trained psychologist, almost all the statements can be broken down into “love me!”  Maybe its too much bedtime magic.  We say “Can you help me find a job?” but really its just “love me?”  Or “Do you think that I am more Carrie or Miranda?”  Its really “Do you think I’m lovable or neurotic?”  Which breaks down into “love me?”  Or we say “I’m not a flake” and it translates into “Don’t see me!  Love me!” I am going to bed now, but I want to venture these 2 thoughts: 1) Bedtime magic is a fabulous thing to listen to with a glass of wine in hand and a lot on your mind.  Nothing helps you see culture like the music we listen to when we are feeling emotional. 2)  People are beautiful.  Intrinsically, objectively, and complexly.  But you cannot appreciate the intrinsic, objective and complex beauty of another until you can look inside and the see the same things there.  Good times.  Goodnight..

           Chillin'  Its the weekend!  This week has been insane.  Our events begin next week and all the little detailey things that were put off during the content development stage became high priority.  So I had Monica, my friend from Connecticut come and help out at the office on Wednesday/Thursday and we got it all done.  In fact, we got it done by Thursday afternoon and I got to take today off!!!   Last night I had a party for my friend Katy's birthday.  We made her dinner (Mexican Rajas) and an ice cream cake (which was a lot easier than I thought it would be) and had her and a 3 other friends over.  We drank wine and told stories and had a grand ol' time.  So, today Monica and I woke up late (9:30- man, we are wildpeople), then went to meet Char Ann for breakfast in Newton Center and then I took Monica back to Connecticut.  Now, after driving back to Boston, I am home, wine in hand, just chillin.  Ahhhh.   I didn't have time to blog this week but I wrote a lot of blogs in my head so I am going to give you a quick synopsis of the cranial activity that you missed because I was to busy to actualize  it on the web.  1)  East meets (mid) west :  Now that I have lived on the East Coast, I think about how different parts of our country are from one another.  For example, I am an easily pleased person (in some respects... ok, this respect).  I like movies, going out to eat, music.  And yet, these three things are wildly different between the Midwest and the East Coast!  In the midwest going out to eat will ALWAYS involve meat.  You will go to Chilli's, TGIFridays, Applebees.  Anyone who has eaten at these establishments know that these are all the same restaurant.  Before I moved to Boston I didn't know that ethnic food meant more than Chineese, Mexican and Italian.  Seriously!  My love for Thai, Indian, Vietnameese or Vegetarian sushi came after a lot of cautious experimentation.  I had a lot of conversations like "Is thai more like Chineese or Mexican?" and getting blank or incredulous looks back.  Finally, the Thai enthusiasts learned of my abiding love for peanut butter and had their weapon.  I am now a big fan.  Movies: in Ohio one can see either blockbusters or blockbusters.  I'm not even sure the likes of Bend it like Beckham or Life is Beautiful made it to the theaters out there.  And I love seeind independent movies!  I really like cheesy romantic blockbusters too, but I like the options.  And finally, music.  I swear to GOD, in Ohio there are three radio stations in every town.  One that plays Oldies from the 60s and 70s (in my town Oldies 103.3), one that plays the top 15 hits over and over and over again (92Zoo) and one that plays Country (Froggy 93).  That's it.  No alternative.  No irish music mondays.  No NPR, nothin.  I realize now that I  am spoiled for the midwest, I expect more of my entertainment triad.  2)   Treadmills  I got my fitness evaluation back this week.  I have "Much higher than average" flexibility and cardio health, 'average" strength (only 25 pushups- man had they seen me before EMDP!) but, and here's the kicker- MUCH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE BODY FAT.  So the report gives me a number than no lady discloses, and I thought that this was my BMI.  So then I go to a BMI chart and discover that I am considered obese.  So of course, I freak ALL THE WAY OUT.  Then I go back to the report and re-read it and its Body Composition.  Which is totally different.  But suffice it to say, that was one black Tuesday.  It was enough to keep me from the gym almost all week, though I did go on Wednesday night and did 35 minutes on the treadmill at an 11% incline.  It was good and I think I am back on the wagon.  3 ) You're not a schmuch, you're a putz  Sex and the City is going off the air.  Sadness.  Serious sadness.  Thank you to Bruce Spero for lending me his keys so that I can go to his HBO equipped abode to view the finale.    That's all the blogs that I can think of off the top of my wine influeced head.  If I can think of more I will come back on and update you.  :)

          Notebooks   Today, I went to Staples to buy post-it notes and turn in a print job for work. While I was there, as is my custom, I browsed through the notebooks and pens to see if there is anything that I need (want).   Here's the thing about me.  I love notebooks.  I like plain Mead notebooks, and if theres something really special about a notebook then I am very excited.  I like the idea that all those blank pages belong to you (assuming you buy them).  Its exciting to think about all the things that could be written in them.  Sometimes its only lists of things that need to be payed, but sometimes its deep thought and revelation.   I feel similarly about pens.  A pen that writes well is a god-send.  I hate to write with pens that skip or have weak ink.  I love a .05, black, roller pen that has a soft grippy thing and bold ink.  There's something about pens and paper that makes me feel boundless, eager and creative.  Like how a ball must feel as it teeters on the edge of a cliff, all of its potential energy surging through it.  One small tap and all of that potential can be realized.  I feel that way about notebooks and pens.

        Glum  I just talked to my grandparents and they aren't able to come to my graduation.  I am glum about it.  I hope that maybe my brother or Dad will be able to come.  If not, I will be fine- my Mom is definitly coming,which is good.  I didn't think I cared until I found out that they couldn't come.  Ah, well. :)

           My Dishes are Rejecting Me!  I bought a set of dishes (pictured above) when I moved into my apartment, approximately 9-10 months ago.  I hadn't broken a dish- not one- in that whole time.  That is, until recently.  In the last week, I have broken a bowl and a small plate.  Two out of 16, that's a high percentage!  I haven't been doing anything different, I haven't been eating off them more, eating off them in different places of eating sharp objects off of them.  I don't understand.  Its almost as if they are trying to destroy themselves so as not to keep me from going to Spain.  I wish the dish god would tell them not to worry, that I will go.  But I want them intact for when I get back!  Go, dish god, tell them!  In other news, I got my ticket in the mail today. They are paper tickets, which makes me very nervous- what if I lose them?  Where should I put them?  But, how exciting is that???    Also, yesterday when I was leaving work- it was light out!  The sun is coming back!!  Hooray! And finally, after today the modules I have been working on at work- the never ending proofing ordeal, will be DONE. They go to the printer for the final proof copy tomorrow!!!  Huzzah!  Note:  I would like to congratulate Ms. Jennifer Slutz, of Disney records, for having the number one selling kids albumn in the nation!  Jennifer is not the artist, but the marketer.  And one of my best friends.  CONGRATULATIONS JEN!

           Sleepy  Yesterday I was tired but I went to the gym anyway. Today I am tired, but I thinkI am going to go home and watch a movie, rather than go to the gym.  A girl can only be a hero once in a while.  Also, two days of being tired like this means that I probably need to take it easy.  Things have been sort of hectic at work and will continue to be so this week.  So there.  I am NOT going to the gym.    How cute is this cat?  Too tired to walk around the food to flop.  Cute cute cute.

           Roaming   I have a book at home called USA On The Road.  I love this book.  I also love maps, travel books, books about people uprooting their lives and people I meet who have done this.  When I get tired of the weather, or irritated at my acquaintances I go to Barnes and Noble and look at travel books.  I love the idea that there are people who are living everywhere on this planet in such differing conditions.  In this country alone, at this very moment, there are incredibly diverse lifes going on.  Lets consider what life would be like across the nation (based on a mixture of conjecture, experience and stereotypes):   1) New York City, New York  New York Ciy!  Where the lights are bright and the rents are high!  In a city where the necessities of life are always bought, one does not have to expend energy to create a life. One just has to expend energy finding the money to buy a life.  The focus of life in New York City is to make money and spend it.  To be "hip" in New York City, one must have enough money to buy designer clothes, eat out for every meal and go for drinks with one's friends.  You must also work out, because looking good is a big part of being "hip."  If you choose to not be hip, there is a place for you here too.  You can spend your money on books and 5 dollar coffee and shop at the many thrift shops.  But if you are poor and unhip then this is going to be a difficult city to live in.  Its one thing to be unhip, its another to live with 4 people in a studio and eat ramen off a hot plate.  So, if you are poor and unhip, move.     2) Four Corners, Arizona  According to USA On the Road, Four Corner Arizona is a place where, left to your own devices, one can be calm.  Calm in the desert.  This is where an American with significantly less money than our friends in NYC (Or anywhere in the Atlantic Northeast, for that matter) can buy a house, work at a job in the air conditioning and feel close to nature.  People who like to hike, who have very good senses of directions (Gerry, anyone?) and who really like the color red) will be happy.  Zen even. Maybe they even commune with mother nature.  Now, this is just a guess, but I bet these people work from 9-5.  It takes them 15 minutes AT THE MOST to get to work and its a traffic jam when there are 5 or 6 cars at a light.  I bet they have smoky bars and movie theaters and enjoy bourbon and smoke marijuana at their homes.  If I lived in Four Corners, AZ I would take up rock gardening and complain about water rationing.  Sounds like a slow, easy life.  But for me, probably close to boring since I don't really like to hike, can get turned around pretty easily and like trees and flowers A LOT.   3) Billings, Montana **Note: I literally had to go to google to find a city/town name in Montana.**  As the note indicates, I am by no means an expert on Montana.  But I did read the Horse Whisperer and my Mom's best friend's son worked at a dude ranch in Wyoming.  So, I think that living in Montana has to involve a lot of solitude.  Since the population of the entire state of Montana is roughly 917,000 (which is only slightly more than the population of San Francisco, CA).  There are 6.2 people per 2000 square miles.  I think that life in Montana involves a lot of sitting on porch swings, working the ranch, worrying about droughts and cooking.  You are probably real attached to your kin.   And why not, they are the 6.2 people you know, and the 6.2 people who will come to your rescue if you get caught in a stampede.  These are the people who work your ranch, make your food, take care of the children and probably mean a whole lot to you.  I would guess that people don't leave their loved ones when they live in Montana-  which is why the population change between census taking is .8%.  This place is all solitude and family- and probably WalMarts.  I bet there's one movie theater in every "town."  And I bet its never played a movie that wasn't a blockbuster.  Except maybe Life is Beautiful.   4) Minster, Ohio  Oh, man do I know about this one.   Minster.  Population 2,740.  Everyone is Catholic and everyone is white, and everyone is happy about it.  They eat friend chicken and they eat fish.  They have a movie store and bowling alley and one, really nice, trailer park.  Average home cost is about 100,000 and WOW, they are nice houses.  The schools are good, the basketball teams are good, and the kids are.... good.  Life in Minster, OH involves eating ice cream in the summer, working 5 minutes from home (What?  a 15 minute drive? What, do I have all day?) coming home for lunch and respecting your elders.  The alcoholics are known and looked at funny.  The kid with the purple hair will "come to no good."  People mean well.  Children grown up and go to Ohio colleges and hope to come back and live in their home town.  Its a "good place to raise a family."  Chances are you have a few acres of land if you just have a house, and lots of acres of land if you have a farm.  Like our friends in Montana you worry about drought, but you probably run your farm for the likes of Tyson.  Life is good and simple and hair raising if its not for you.  My mother loves it, she feels like she finally belongs.  I am glad for these people, but keep me out of there!   5) San Diego, California  All my life I thought that San Diego was smallish town.  Then when I was looking for a city that had a population about that of Montana, I realized- San Diego has 1.2 million people!! That's twice the size of Boston, MA!  I'll be.  So, for such a large metrropolis it has quite a mellow reputation.  City making in San Diego entails tearing down old things and building new things.  Out with the old!  Even if the old is all of 5-10 years old.  San Diego is beautiful and warm, and not LA.  Which suits the residents just fine.  Living in San Diego is like living in Disney World.  Things are beautiful and new and taken care of.   I suppose they have to commute about half an hour, spend the weekends at the beach, have fairly nice cars and failry steep rent.  You can learn to surf, smoke pot and get up to no good.  Its a mellow place, but not like Arizona.  Its not ZEN.  Because it is still California- its still hip.  Its like a channel summer suit- well put together, chic and colorful.  I think that despite it seeming disregard for history and the politics of affordable housing, I would like San Diego.     6) Little Rock, Arkansas  Welcome to the white trash capital of America.  Ask anyone who has lived there, visited there or flown over.  The crime is terrible, hatred is rampant and views are narrow.  Life involves making no money, being too hot to try to change that, and learning to shoot squirrels.  People who don't want to be there buy have to be, turn to self mutilation or Victorian novels.  Alcohol is the drug of choice for the old folks, anything they can get their hands on is the drug of choice for the high school crowd.  Gangs form and hate each other.  There are some wealthy people, but they keep to themselves and don't involve themselves in the plight of the city.  Think Detroit, wihtout the sense to know it ought to be better.  Living in America, though seemingly diverse, would look like about as diverse as the Olson twins to someone who lives in Asia, for example or Africa.  However I am not Asian or African and I am amazed and interested in knowing how people are getting along in a country as geographically, temperately and socially diverse at this one.  United we stand and all that....  I have to get back to work... but your thoughts are very welcome.  Especially if you can describe somewhere like Boise Idaho, or Denver Colorado- places I don't understand, but want to!

          Today I saw the weirdest thing- a Hummer with Dominos advertising on it.  Clearly the person driving the hummer owned a dominos or 50, and was using his car to advertise- but come on!  A HUMMER with Dominos advertising. What is this word coming to?  He was also driving slowly, so he obviously cannot be trusted.  Its the weekend, and I was up at 8:30 this morning.  I watched a movie (Confidence) and now I am at work getting the other two things I need to get done for Monday.  Then I am going to Barnes and Noble, then to the gym, then home to do some homework.  Currently I have no plans to watch the SuperBowl, but if something comes up I just might watch it.  Probably will not watch it by myself, instead I will watch another movie.  Well, off to stage 2- B&N.

          Shocking News in AmandaLand   Guess what?  I know you are dying to know- I am an INTJ.  All my life I thought I was an ENTJ!  This means that I am a mastermind instead of an executive.  Very interesting.  For those of you who want more information (its all about ME ME ME), check out this very interesting link: http://fuzzy.snakeden.org/intj/ or this more general link: http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/tt/t-articl/mb-simpl.htm  There is a LOT of information on Myers Briggs typology on the web, and its fun to read people describe your type.  Fun Fun.  Whose working hard? Ummm, me?

          Sleepy   Its weird- but on rainy gray days, I cannot seem to move faster than a snail. I feel like a nap, but I am at work.  My boss is cranky today, so I don't think he'd find it funny if I stretched out on the floor and stayed there untill 5.   I think I am going to go to Starbucks and get a half caf, nonfat, sugar free, vanilla late.  Everytime I order my new "signature drink" from Starbucks I think of that scene in You've Got Mail, where Tom Hanks is going on about how Starbucks was designed to give people with no decision making power whatsoever an absolutely defining sense of self.  Aparently I am a sugar free vanilla late.  I just discovered the sugar free possibility of Starbucks.  I suggest you try the sugar free vanilla syrup, its better than the other!    Back at the office, Starbucks in hand.  The warmth is already making me feel better, but the half-caf hasn't hit me yet... but I bet it will.  Since I gave up coffee way back in the day for the migraines, I can have a diet coke and feel like i am flying high.  Ah, remember the days of 4 cups a day?  Ah, migraines. So, here's a question- why do people think its OK to ask me if I have enough money to go to Europe?  I mean, if its my Mom that's OK, but just like friends?  I mean, that's like asking someone, so do you have enough money to pay your rent?  Or do you make enough money to buy all those groceries?  Its a decision I have made, I probably have the money!  And if I don't do you think that you are going to be the one to make me change my mind?  The worst is when they ask "HOW are you going to afford this?"  Like I am just going to whip out my spreadhseet and say, "well, with this money and this money and this smoney, and by then I'll have this, etc" ITS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS.  That really gets me, and I'm not sure why.  See, ther are some people who I know are just asking cause they care, and that doesn't bother me.  Like if Monica or Char Ann asked me, I would know that they were asking so they could help or out on concern- like my Mom.  But others just seem to want to know so they can more ifnormation to judge, or be jealous, or find out if someone else made this happen for me, like then they could feel sorry for themselves.  I know that things bother me that wouldn't bother others but there you are. I can only be me! My posting on this site has been very sporatic lately, but I really need to get back into it.  I think that since my paper was due and work was crazy I just didn't want to have organize another idea or thought.  And nobody on here wants to read my hyper organized thoughts about how children learn to read or the proper way to format c module.  :)  Hey, this is Monica's first week at her new job- good luck Monica! And, this is a big week for Tall Jen- Good luck in your review! I suppose I ought to sign off so that I can use this half-caf high (it hit!) to get some productive work done.

        Closer and Closer  Today I got my backpack!!!!  Its very cute, and very big.... and I like it.  The guy listened to my list of clothes that I was going to bring and then heard me say that I wanted to get more clothes while I was there... and he said, yeah, you'll need this one.  And I was like- Oh my God! And he was like "Yeah!" and I was like "Are you sure?" And he was like "Yeah." So I was like "OK!" and he was like, and I was like. It wsa quite fun. I also got camera bag to hold the super fabulous camera my brother got me, that has room for other things in it- like the exciting binoculars that takes pictures.   I wont be able to really use it as a camera in Europe, because its digital, but it was 40.00 and VERY on sale.  I also got a blow up travel pillow, a money belt, a clothes line and some clippy things to hold thing on the outside of the bag.  Very exciting!  Shopping! And spending even more money.  I will have to go back to the get the locks, the were out of them.  AND I got it all at Eastern Mountain Sports, the direct competitor to Bob Smith's wilderness house- which is the store of Brian Shaunessey, the world's WORST landlord ever.  Huzzah!

          Just a day Just an ordinary day Just tryin' to get by Just a boy Just an ordinary boy But he was lookin' to the sky And as he asked me if I'd come along I started to realize- That everyday he finds Just what he's lookin' for Like a shooting star he shines He said  Take my hand Live while you can Don't you feel the dreams are right in the palm of your hand And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words Although they did not feel, no For I felt what I had not felt before You'd swear those words could heal And as I looked up into those eyes His vision borrows mine And to know he's no stranger For I feel I've held him for all of time And he said  Take my hand Live while you can Don't you feel the dreams are right in the palm of your hand, In the palm of your hand In the palm of your hand Please come with me See what I see Touch the stars for time will not flee Time will not flee Can you see? - Vanessa Carlton   What are your dreams?  What were your dreams?  Do you remember how the dreams you had when you young made you feel?  Do you remember your chest filling with excitement, so much that you felt you would burst, that you could fly?  What has happened to those dreams?  Was that just potential energy, like a ball perched precariously on a cliff?  And what would have happened if you just tapped the ball?  Would it have fallen, and what would have become of you then?   When I go to the symphony orchestra I feel the energy pulsing through the room, and part of that is the wave of the music coming over me, and part of it is the incredible dedication and bravery it takes to follow your dream, and to sit in a seat that encompasses that dream.  Why why why would you settle for no glitter?  Why would you settle for no passion?  Why?   Fear.  The incredible power of fear, the incredible power of memory.  The incredible feeling of “I cannot go through that again.”  Knee deep in fear, you see no way out, indeed don’t seek a way out.  You call it “reason.”  You call it “security.”  But both reason and security presuppose that you will be around long enough to enjoy them, and that if you do live long enough that they will fulfill you.  When someone questions you, you get angry and explain to them with unshakable reason, that you have responsibilities, that you cannot just “up and” do what you dream, become who you dream to be. In actuality you are saying “I cannot be that person, it would be too hard, too scary, and to fail, would mean the death of a dream.     I have to write a stupid paper to fulfill one of my goals, but it’s my dreams that keep me awake, fearful-l not of failing, but of not finding the courage to try.  And so I approach the cliff, slowly carefully, and with every intention of falling off the cliff, with that ball in the palm of my hand.  Wish me luck.

          Overwhelmed   I have GOT to stop looking at internet sites about Europe- I am making myself crazy. Between trying to figure out where to stay, where to go, whether to get a Eurail ticket I can't seem to get anywhere!  I need to take Noemi's advice and just wait until I get there and decide once I have been to language school and know how much money I have, etc.   In other news, I got an extension of my "thesis-" its now due on Monday.  I can't seem to work on it.... don't want to work on it.  So I work on it a little bit every day and despite my best efforts I am about halfway done.  I am going to finish it this weekend, certainly, because its due.  So, I am mid tail-chase.  I suppose I shoudl work, though there's not much to do around here right now.

          Seeking Advice  Once I am done with language school, I plan to get  Eurail pass with 3 or 4 countries on it and travel around for between 1 and 2 mos.  The question is- WHICH COUNTRIES?  Here's the game- you have to choose 3 or 4 countries that border each other.  If they have a checkmark on the graph they border by train, if there's a boat, they "border" with a ferry.  I am interested in your opinion of which countries I should choose and WHY.  Specifically, what would you do there if you could spend 2 mos in these countries.  Help me!  I am drowning in choices! :) Amanda

          Extremely Detailed Update   Hello world!  Here is the update on the exciting travel plans of Ms. Holman.  This last week has been a big one for making the "plan" a reality.  Here are my plans so far!   May 28th:  On Virgin Atlantic, flight number 10 at 11:10 PM, I will embark on a 6 hour and 40 minute flight to London's Heathrow Airport.  Due to the 5 hour time change I will arrive in Hathrow Saturday morning at 10:50 AM.  For those of you who are interested, I will be in seat 350- which should be a window if my wishes were tended to.  Due to the "red eye" nature of the flight I plan to sleep ridiculous amounts on the days preceding the flight so that I arrive in London ready for action!   ____________________________________________ For more information on Virgin Atlantic flights: http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/flying_with_us.view.do ____________________________________________   May 29th, May 30th:  As mentioned, I will arrive in London Heathrow at 10:50AM.  I am staying in the Millenium Lodge, a hostel very near Notting Hill.  On Saturday I am planning to dump my backpack and jet lag and launch into travelling full force.  I really want to make it to the outdoor market on Notting Hill and then get something to eat and go see a show.  Then, I am sure, that I will crash like a car flying off a 200 ft cliff.  Sunday I plan to go to London Bridge, get real British tea somewhere British and then maybe see another show- they have half price tickets in Leicester Square that I will do my best to utilize.  London theater is said to rival, or even best Broadway and last time I was in London I didn't go see a "show."  I saw "Shakespeare's works in 90 minutes" by the Reduced Shakespeare Company and that was great, and a comedy show I enjoyed, but this time I really want to see a "SHOW!" and so I shall.  :) _______________________________________________________ For more information on the Millennium Lodge: http://www.hostellondon.com/hosteldetails.php?HostelNumber=4483  For more information on TKTS in Leicester Square and Theater in London, general http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/tkts _______________________________________________________   May 31st through June 2nd:   On May 31st, upon arrival at Waterloo Station, at 10:34 AM, I will board the Eurostar Chunnel train and zoom across the English Channel at an extraordinary speed towards the snooty town of Pareeee.  I will arrive at the Paris Nord Station at 2:17 PM.  During my three day stay in Paris I will stay at the Centre International de Paris, a hostel within 2 minutes of the Louvre.  A friend of mine, also conveniently named Amanda, suggested this hostel to me, and since there are hardly any hostels in Paris, and I was planning to spend like 60 bucks a night in a hotel, I was delighted for the suggestion.  Instead of 60 a night, its 20, and so- I can eat!  Huzzah!!  I have every intention of visiting the Louvre, something I didn't have the time to do when I was in Paris last year, and something I really want to do now that I have read the Da Vinci Code.  I want to learn more about Leonard da Vinci before I go too- he's fascinating!  The other plan for my time in Paris is to be in Paris IN SPRINGTIME!!! How exciting is that?  I will most certainly make it to the Champs Elyses and probably to the Public Gardens.  I would like to go one of the daily masses at Notre Dame, which I did last time and enjoyed immensley, despite it being in French.   ______________________________________________ For more information on the Eurostar Chunnell train http://www.eurostar.com/dctm/jsp/subhome/subhome.jsp?page=about  For more information on the Centre International De Paris http://www.bvjhotel.com/   go to the top right corner and click BJV Louvre  For More information on the Louvre: http://www.louvre.fr/louvrea.htm _______________________________________________   June 3rd through June 5th:  On June 3rd, I will travel to the Paris Orly airport and board an EasyJet flight to Barcelona, Spain at 10:50 AM (Flight 4781).  The flight will land in Barcelona at 12:30.  The flight was all of 50 dollars- how awesome is EasyJet??????  The train would have cost more and  taken 3 times longer!  Amazing.  Currently I have no plans for Barcelona because I don't know anything about it.  Its the next project.  I will find a fun hostel and fun sights.  I would LOVE any suggestions from those of you who have been there!!  _____________________________ For more information on EasyJet: www.easyjet.com _____________________________   June 6th through June 27th:  TENERIFE HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!  On Sunday, June 6th, I will get myself to the Barcelona airport by 8:45AM to board SpanAir flight 781, bound for the Canary Island of Tenerife!!!  That's right, I am going to language school on the Island of Tenerife.  Yes, an Island.  Paradise.  Monica says it reminds her of Hawaii.  That pleases me.  Take a look at the language school link below and gawk at the pictures of Tenerife.  I am doing three weeks of language school through DonQuijote language school.  I am staying in a "student flat" and will have 4 hours of instruction a day.  The rest of the time I intend to spend lying on the beach, reading cheesy romance novels, and dancing the night away in the famous Spanish clubs.  Oh, lordy, I can't wait.   __________________________________ For more information on SpanAir http://www.spanair.com/en/  For more information on DonQuijote in Tenerife http://www.donquijote.org/english/tenerife.asp  For more information about the Island of Tenerife: http://www.tenerife.net/ ____________________________________   June 27th and BEYOND!  Once language school is over I will take the other half of my SpanAir flight back to Barcelona and attempt to amuse myself for a month or so.  I don't really know what will become of me.  I have vague ideas of going to Hungary, Italy, the south of France, Portugal, etc.  I have prety definite ideas of going to Ireland for the month of August.  My flight home is at the end of September and I can change that date for 25.00. Its all very exciting for me to have so much to plan, and so much still in the air.  I like the juxtaposition of what I am considering my "vacation" part (the part before June 27) and the "adventure" part (the rest of the time).  I am enjoying myself immensely.    Those of you who know me well, know that this planning is the most fun ever!!  My Grandma says that the anticipation is half the fun, and damn it if my Grandma's not right!  Other projects in the works are: 1) obtaining travel gear- what's the right backpack, what security equipment do I need? What kind of clothes should I bring, etc. 2) What to do in Barcelona 3) Investigating travel insurance- what kind of coverage do I need?  What needs to be registered?  What company should I go through?

       How I love caffeine- no wonder I was addicted to the point of migraine on coffee..... I am sitting here drinking a diet vanilla coke and as the caffeine builds up in my system, I'm dancing in my seat, singing a little tune, planning how i am going to do laundry and dishes and pay bills when I get home.  Little realizing, I suppose, that my the time I get home my caffeine high will be gone.  Oh well, better to make promises when the feeling of productivity is high, cause then you have to keep them, even when they mean being crabby.  But anyway, I hate that stupid red bull cartoon, but I will agree "(cafeine).. gives you wings!" I am at work for 2 glorious hours, then back to Cambridge to oversee an academy.  Thank god for this incredibly predictable and cheesy romance novel one of the RP's gave me.  Nora Robert's Born in Ireland Trilogy.  I read the first of the three books yesterday, and will continue with book two this afternoon.  I see those looks- I AM WORKING ON MY THESIS.  I am!  Stop chastising me!  OK, fine I'll work on it this afternoon.  Jerk. Ah, the voice of my mother that lives in my head.  Thank God for her.

        Uncertainty   A guy who I once thought I was interested in, but who sort of dropped me unceremoniously just wrote me an e-mail showing interest again.  I am not interested in someone who would drop me unceremoniously.  I am less interested in someone who thinks he can waltz back in the limelight without apologizing for the unceremonious dropping.  Just a casual "So is 5 weeks a good response time?" to an e-mail I had sent him saying, "Are we still on for this weekend?"   I am feeling tired today.  The tired that comes from deep inside, where I feel weepy and uncertain.... the painting above is called uncertain landscape.  That's how my interior feels.  And on a night when I know that sleep will bring me peace, I am for the first time in ages, feeling insomia.  Its 11, and I have to get up early.   This is the last week of the travelling, and as much as i have enjoyed them, I look forward to being back in the office.  I need to get  up at 7:45 instead of 5:45.  Those two hours earlier are making my life feel very stilted. I finished a book today (by Nora Roberts) set in Ireland about finding your true love, that could account for my crankiness too.  I want to feel that feeling again- not necessarily true love- that would be most inconvenient, but excitement, the suge of emotion and the fervor of anticipation.  Just something to think about, someone to think about.  Someone who calls me and asks about my life and who talks of missing me.  Que sera sera.

           The “I’m Late!” Olympics    Welcome to the “I’m Late!” Olympics!  There are five challenging events that, taken together, represent the battery of skills necessary in appearing calm, cool and collected upon arrival at the event which the contestant is supposed to manage. The first event is one of the most stressful and can set the tone for the entire Olympic games: Waking Up!  The night before, we have set the alarms for the contestants on low volume, to ensure that they will wake up much later than necessary.  The task involves taking a shower, brushing teeth, washing face, and procuring breakfast, all in 15 minutes!  The contestants are scored on their ability to squeeze as many adjunct tasks as possible, including shaving legs, actually eating in the home, and turning off lights.  All contestants must be in the car within 15 minutes of points will be taken off.  The second event, Getting There is one that takes multi-tasking to a whole new level.  While driving at least 75 miles an hour (Points for driving over 90) on major highways and at least 45 on city streets, our contestants are required to eat breakfast, put on their makeup, find their locations, and remain calm.  Extra points are rewarded for effectively using red lights for intense makeup sessions, setting up the cell phone hands free operations, or tracking down directions to the location. The third event, Handling the Inevitable is an exercise in staying in one’s “center.”  While driving, it is inevitable that someone will drive 60 in the fast lane, an accident will stop traffic, or you will miss a turn and end up on a divided highway with no way to turn around for 5 miles.  The assumption in these situations is that you can’t do anything to change them.  They are inevitables.  Therefore, points are given to contestants for staying calm, singing along to the radio and dahn jon tapping.  Points are taken off for screaming, banging on the steering wheel, and becoming so tense as to develop a headache.  Contestants are disqualified for crying in this crucial event. The fourth event, Set Up, requires contestants to arrive on location, unload their cars of 3 boxes onto a rolling cart and find someone in the hotel to carry the 3-6 heavy boxes from the car to the registration area.  All of this heaving lifting and transport must happen within 5 minutes of arriving.  Points are given for smiling at volunteers, trainers and early participants, and impressing the need for speed upon the hotel without appearing panicked.  Points are taken away for running, sweating, and eliciting the response from trainers of “are you OK?  Do you need anything?”  Contestants are disqualified for yelling at any parties involved and crying.   The final and most critical task is getting the event started on time.  Once the registration area is set up, and all boxes of materials are in place, the task becomes getting all registrants checked in and directed to the breakfast and their tables on time.  This is a pass/fail event.  If the event starts on time, the contestant is allowed to content for a medal.  If the event does not start on time, the score will be taken, but the contestant is knocked out of running for a medal- because here at the “I’m Late!” Olympics, we can only reward those who are calm, cool, and on time.

          Driving Massachusetts aka Amanda on the Road   3 days in Andover Massachusetts and 2 days in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.  A total of 7 hours in the car to and from these locales and about 5 cold cut sandwhiches.  The lifting of at least 10 50 lb boxes.  2 crossword puzzles, three books, 15 hours staring out the window and 6 hours of work on my thesis.  This is my week.  And tomorrow it winds up.  I cannot wait.  I refuse to get in the car this weekend, I practically refuse to get out of bed.  Though I will have to both of those things because I need to go to the library to work on my thesis and figure out how to do an observation for my class.  The paper is due next week on the observation and I don't know how to do them, let alone actually done an observation. Wish me luck.  And while you're at it, throw in some good cheer for my thesis.  More coherent messages this weekend, God willing. Goodnight, Moon.

           Catch Up  So, I am actually doing it!  I am typing my blog at the hotel and since I am stopping at the office on my way home I am going to send it this evening.  Forethought!  And it only took me a week to figure it out.  The events are going well. They are very easy compared with last summer.  I pretty much get here at 6:45-7:00 AM and put out the registration materials, and help get the room set up, register them, and then sit outside the room until about11:30 when I go make sure the food for lunch is delivered and correct.  Then I eat lunch and sit until 3:30 when the academy is over and the participants leave.  I am trying to use this time to write my thesis but I find myself reading books and staring out the window more than reading the articles and working on my paper.  I am however feeling motivated today so once I am done I am going to make the Word outline and begin filling it in.   On the workout topic- I went for a walk with my neighbor last night.  We walked for a little over an hour and I enjoyed it- it was a nice night to be out walking. I really like my neighborhood. It’s very safe I think, and having someone to walk with makes it even safer.  We walked all the way down into Brookline and then up Comm Ave to our house.  I am not sure it necessarily counts as a hard core workout, but it was the best I could do.  I find that I am very tired after getting up so early and sitting around doing nothing all day.  It’s off my regular schedule and the very early mornings are getting to me.  I am looking forward to being in Cambridge next week because I can drive there in less than 20 minutes, a nice change.   This weekend was very interesting.  Some of you may remember from the endless blog from LAST weekend that my first boyfriend in college came to visit me this weekend, somewhat out of the blue and that his visit was looked forward to with some suspicion.  Well, he came and we had some very good conversations.  He didn’t try to dodge anything and we had some very enlightening exchanges of information.  He also didn’t put on a smoke and mirrors show in defense of himself or his actions, indeed he was, by all indicators, sincere.  I hope that it was an agreeable turn of event for him and it most certainly was for me.  Mostly, for me, it was a chance to get rid of a lot of dead weight.  I had this angry little man inside of me, composed of upset and confusion and mistrust who hasn’t gotten angrier but has been cranky since college.  When we talked through the details of the situation that surrounded our inevitable break up and his subsequent relationship (not the details of his relationship, the details of how that came to be, as it was messy and unfortunate) with my roommate at the time, I was able to let it go.  I can now say that I understand, that I wasn’t completely wrong, but that I certainly not right in my estimation of the situation.  And now, I can breathe more easily.  That anger and confusion is calmed.  And I am all for calming the angry man inside.  So, right now he’s drinking tea and considering Thai Chi.  The angry man inside, not the ex-boyfriend.  Though, who knows, maybe he is too. In fact, I too am considering Thai Chi.   The Brookline Thai Chi center is starting 7 week courses this week and I think it might be something I would like to do, depending on how much it costs.  I have always liked the moving meditations we did in yoga and this might be similar.  I will certainly keep you updated!!!

          First of all, the picture above doesn't have anything to do with this blog per say, but I thought it was way, way too cute to be cut out merely because it didn't go.  So, on with the blog!     Friendship with a Volatile Person  One time Monica said to me, while I bemoaning my inability to hide my emotions ever, ever, ever, "But Amanda Jane, that's what we love about you!  Your brutal honesty!"  Now, how you can love anything brutal (even the beast from Beauty and the Beast just looked brutal) is beyond me.  But if you take out brutal you come to the double edged sword of being friends with me.  I am not just honest.  I am emotional.  I am insistant.  I am irritable.  I am abrupt.  I am high maintenance.  And I am, sometimes, volatile.  On the other edge of the sword is the fact that I  am  honest, I am supportive, I am dependable, I am excitable, and I am willing to work at friendship. It comes to pass this year that I have been friends with my college friends for 8 years.  Those who survived can tell you that the volatility comes out when the emotion-o-meter is registering high scores as well, or when I haven't eaten.  They know to take me immediately to food when I say I am hungry, not to ignore when I am upset, and to step between me and the person who is irritating me for everyone's sake. They also know that it takes the slightest of apologies for me to forgive , but the longest of talks for me to "forget".  They also know that if I have my head out of the clouds long enough to realize that I've hurt them, that I will apologize for half an hour and probably cry, and that if I don't apologize its because I have my head in the clouds.  Its not for the weak at heart, friendship with me.   I think of this because of the resolution of a long standing feud with a friend.  Now, after a really long time of not being friends, I have to somehow fix the things I have said in anger and hurt feelings to others who knew him.  I somehow have to make the world see that he's not so bad, that I was just hurt.  And I shake my head at myself.  One friend I talked to today was like "I knew that!" when I told him that I overreacted and the feuding friend wasn't bad at all.   Though I will never be able to be a calm, cool observer, I hope that I have learned that telling the truth is much better than a version of the truth hyped up by hurt feelings and a desire to win empathy. Not that I would take it well if you point this out to me when I am telling my story.  :) I canna help who I be, but only hope tis worth it t'ya to be friends with me.

        Wrapping Things Up   Thinngs are winding down.  I am working on the last of my projects here at work and next week is my last event.  I turned in the final copy of my thesis on Monday at class and now I only have a small paper to write for my final exam and a 10 page paper to turn in for my independent study.  All of this must be completed for the May 14th, end of semester deadline.  I got a bit of a "stay" in one area of winding down- Monica was going to come this weekend and we were going to break down my "stuff" and get rid of what's going and pack up what's staying, but we have decided to put it off for a weekend.  So, I have one more week to revel in my belongings. It would appear that I have allergies.  I haven't even had them before but my eyedoctor and many a lay person has said its probably the case.  I do have itchy eyes, and a headache behind my eyes and I've been sneezing some and having a touch of a runny nose.  I don't want to give in and believe I have allergies though, because I have never had allergies before! But I probably will if it means that I can feel better. :) Feeling tired, and done for today.

        Life and Death From one who doesn't know   A friend of mine is suffering the loss of a friend.  A high school friend who continued to be his friend until last Sunday, 8 years later.  She was 26 when she was found dead, face down in a puddle, in her pajamas.  There is nothing to say and so much to think about.  It could have been me, it could have been him, it could have been any one of my cherished friends.   No one I love has ever died, with the exception of my Grandfather's sister who was very old and it was certainly her time.  I have no idea what it would feel like to die, no idea what it would mean to live with such an emptiness.   What does death mean?  How can we know, why is it our business?  When someone dies- someone who, with little alteration, could have stepped into my life, my mind forces me to consider the possibility of my death and the death of the people who make my life worth living.  I could not handle it, and please, please don't make me prove myself false.   Mandy Alexander was a nice girl, I've met her.  God, please take care of her family and friends while they attempt to deal with this irreplacable loss.

          SHE'S COMING HOME!   My friend Sara has been in the Peace Corps for the last 2 1/2 years and in 2 weeks, she's coming home!  I talked to her on the phone today (a very funny experience with the guards at the Peace Corps compound in Cotonou- involving a lot of "Hallo?"  A bunch of french and then "Hold on," over and over while they tried to transfer the call to a phone that wasn't working)  and she is doing her paperwork, writing up her resume and planning her trip home!  She is planning to go to Ghana for about a week to shop and lay in the sand on the beaches and then fly from Ghanna to London, to Cincinatti, OH! Very exciting!   In the middle of May (19-25) I am going home to visit my family and I will see her then!  Hooray!!

         I am trying to write a blog but the DayQuill I have taken is making my head spin a little.  Can't really complete sentences, or concentrate on work or find "witty" commentary to amuse myself with....  so I'll talk about mundaneity and hope for the best.   Can you really call yourself witty?   Rather, did I just really call myself or my commentary witty?  I did, but is it possible for one to determine that one is witty?  Isn't witty quite a bit like attractive?  Its an adjective that cannot hold up outside of the opinion of the one who said it.  No one is objectively attractive, or objectively witty, its entirely wound up in the opinion of the person who produced the judgement.  So, let me refrain and say ".... or concentrate on work or comentate in a way amusing to myself." So, back to mundaneity.  Today is Tuesday.  I am going to get my hair cut so that its a little shorter and a little less prone to sticking straigh up in the air.... or a little more prone depending on whether I want it to or not... Tomorrow is Wednesday, I have a date with the previously described boy, and I dare say it will be fun.  The day after that is Thursday (in the usual way) and I am going to meet my fabulous friend Alisa for dinner and then go to the first movie of the Bon Voyage movie festival (my friends and I are having a movie a week for 4 weeks, the first is about travelling in Europe in general[before sunrise], the second is about London [Love Actually], the third about Paris [Amelie] and the fourth about Barcelona [Can't remember]) .  Following Thursday is Friday when I am going to see 13 going on 30 with Katy and Amanda and Noemi and thenI am going to Connecticut for the weekend.  So there, mundaneity in its finest.  Now I must run off and get my hair cut!

          Museums   Paris, France is all about museums.  I have never, ever heard of so many museums in one place.  And most of them are art museums.  Some of them are grand museums focusing on a specific type of art- the modern art at the Pompidou, Art Nouveau and Impressionism at the Musee d'Orsay, the tne historical art and objects d'art of the GRAND LOUVRE.  London has a lot of museums as well, but the objects within are often more historical in nature than artistic.  I am not a huge fan of museums.  I like to go to ones that have fun themes, but I don't like traditional art museum very much and I am not a history buff, unless that history involves intrigue.  My biggest problem with art museums is that its often full of portraits of kings, pictures of Jesus surrounded by adoring fans, or boats.  I understand that in the world of art these have a lot of historical significance and within these traditional subjects are often subtly political statements (Is that a woman seated next to Jesus at the Last Supper?) or crazy new ways of using paint to make the boat really come out at you!  But I don't know these thigns!  So all I see is a portrait of an ugly king sitting pompously on a pillow.  How was I supposed to know that this symbolizes his return to power, with a new emphasis on the proletariat?  I must now bore you with the list of museums/cultural forays I have planned to visit and a quick comment on why:  London  Tate Modern: Modern art: I don't know much abuot art, truthfuly.  I really need to channel someone like Monica to make viewing art an educational experience.  I do like things that are interesting and the pictures of the museums collection included a phone done up in tiger strips and a sculpture of a man lying flat on his back with a tiger on top of him (the India exhibit).   Museum of Natural History: I really like museums of science and natural history.  They always have interesting exhibits about physics, the weather, evolution, dinosaurs, extinct animals, etc.  I feel like I learn little tidbits about the world, and not just angstful opinions about the world (which is how I feel at art museums sometimes). Jack the Ripper Tour (Not a museum but a historical walk ending at a pub): I am very excited about this walking tour!  Aparently the WORLD'S EXPERT on Jack the Ripper takes you through the dark sketchy alleys where he left the bodies and shows you photographs of the bodies as they were found by the police and then ends up at the Ten Bells, the pub where he scouted out his victims!  I am also going to the New Globe theater, which has a museum, but I am going to see a production of Much Ado About Nothing.     Paris  Now Paris was hard.  There are so many art museums and in order to not get stuck staring desolately at our friend the newly re-empowered king, I had to do a great deal of research to determine where I could go.   The Pompidou Centre: For ten euros you can get a day pass and wander the museum, coming and going at your leisure.  It has a place known for great views of Paris (which will have to suffice, as the Eiffel tower charges 10, 50 to go to the top!!!), a temporary exhibit of Joan Miro's work (and artist that I like) and the Paris museum of modern art.  It also has exhibits on cinema and a new media center, whatever that means.  Salvador Dali Museum: Because I like Dali, and I hear they have sculptural representations of his greatest works. Museum of arts and crafts: I thought at first that it must be a museum full of quilts and decoupage.  It is, however a museum that pays tribute to humankinds ingenuity!  Hopefully this will be set in the context of "Well, people use to have pick cotton seeds out by hand (HERE, TRY IT?  Hurts dont it?) and then how one man (Eli) thought, "man, if we could just get a machine to do this, I could go have some lemonade" and so the cotton gin was born! I'll let you know. Musee Zadkine: A Russian Sculptor who worked within the cubist, expressionist and the abstractionist movements.  Aparently his work is really dark and "tormented looking." The Catacombs: Aparently, skulls and bones line the walls. Ugh! Jardin Tuilleries: Some might call it a museum of nature.   Musee Louvre: I am going after six on Monday evening to see the works covered in the DaVinci code.  There are a  lot of good things at the Louvre, but its a tad to "traditional" for the short amount of time I have to allocate.  But i am going on Monday so that if I love it to pieces I can go again before I leave.

          Dating   I went on a date last night... the guy from the bar last Friday, actually called on Monday (will wonders never cease?) and we went out to Chineese and blues last night.  We went to Central Square to Mary Chungs and then to the Cantab lounge for a blues jame (i.e. moderately talented people from the audience singing the songs of extraordinarly talented blues icons).  During the course of the evening I was informed that I was smart and that I was well represented by my fortune cookie (physically beautiful).  It was nice..... the nicest part?   Not really feeling anything other than interest and attraction.  That is, I don't feel awkward or panicked or like I am losing out on anyting by the fact that I am fleeing the country in a tad more than a month.  (Oh Lord, the month part will go from "a little more than" to "exactly" in 2 weeks.) In other news, I took an IQ test today (I was sort of surprised into it- it was a pop up and it looked interesting and the next thing I know I am knee deep in logic puzzles and analogies).  According to Tickle.com, I am an Insightful Linguist. "You are gifted with the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind."  Is  this  guy trying to date me?  So, of course once you are on one of those sites you HAVE to do other tests, and I found out that I am an Observer, and my religious views most closely match with the openminded Unitairan Universalists.  Fun stuff! Finally, I bought my travel insurance today.  I am now fully capable of cancelling my trip if something happens to me and able to buy "incidentals' if I am delayed in travel, or my luggage is dealyed en- route.  Huzzah! And so goes Thursday.....

          Paris   For trip planning purposes I am planning one 2-3 day city a week for three weeks.  Let me clarify: I am going to three cities in my first week overseas- London, Paris and Barcelona.  Last week I planned London.  This week I am planning Paris.  Next week, Barcelona.  I am doing one a week so that I can really investigate each city, but also because I could go crazy trying to figure out three at at time  And I started with London because I wasn't excited about it at all. I figured that I would learn about London and grow excited about it.  And that happened!  What also happened, which is the subject of this blog, is that I became extremely blocked about Paris. As I became more excited about London, I became more blocked about Paris.  Now, part of this has to do with my experience in Paris last year.  When I was there last year I spent all of my time wandering around from cafe to cafe ordering coffee and trying to get the waiter to speak to me in French.  I was on a crusade to convince people of the totally untrue fact that I could speak French.  Now, I can't have unlimited coffee, I can't spend unlimited amounts of money on said coffee and yet, when I think about Paris all I want to do is be there.  As soon I get to thinking about "OK, what am I going to do? Let's research, let's plan!" I go all dreamy and imagine myself walking down narrow, twisty streets admiring flowers and staring blankly as the Seine roars by.  I am getting a little dreamy right now!  Paris Springtime, wandering the Champs Elyses wearing a sundress..... OK.  So- you see how I am not getting anything done! The other part of the blockage is the edge of panic ("Oh my God what am I doing?") which increases in equal intervals with my excitement and singlemindedness (You will have noticed that I write about little else).  It was fine to think about London, that was just 2 days, they speak English, I am familiar with the city, etc.  However!  The train to Paris takes me away from the place I started, puts me in a country where I speak 2 phrases (Parlez Lentement, sil vous plait [speak slowly, please- a totally useless phrase because they could say one syllable per minute and I still wouldn't speak enough French to understand them], and Parlez vous l'anglais? [Do you speak English- which earns me a great number of haughty looks and, finally, some comprehension]) and drops right into the country with which the US has the most cultural animosity.  Essentially, going to Paris will whip me out of my comfort zone and place me squarely into where I want to be- hyper-learning mode.  (What am I doing!?  How exciting!- I am staring to feel schizophrenic)   So, imagine how every single time I think of Paris, I become dreamy (Sundresses, springtime), panicked (What the hell am I doing?) and excited (I can't wait!) you can see how my brain is saying no to all this.  Thus, resulting in a big ol' Paris block.  However, I seek to destroy the block by sheer force of will.  I have been forcing myself to read the Paris section of my travel books with the air of a disinterested traveler, and I am going to go to the travel book store and have a couple hour session of reading up on Paris in particular.  But now, I really need to get back to my daydreaming.... What?  I'm at work?

          EASTER!   Easter was a very nice holiday for me.  I thought it was going to be a long and boring weekend, but instead it was fun and relaxing!  On Friday night my neighbor and I decided that we would "play makeup" my makeup book,  Making Faces , by Kevin Aucoin.  After we fancied ourselves up we got dressed up and then went to a bar in our neighborhood.  While there a boy started talking to me, and we sort of hit it off, though its hard to tell how much is hitting it off and how much is Cider Jack and dark lighting :)  He took my number and he is supposed to call me this evening...we'll see.  Interestingly, he dated a girl who I not only went to college with but was in my fraternity.  Weird.  Anyway, due to the late nature of Friday night, I went to bed at about 4AM and then woke up by 10, as my Mom called to tell me about her fun night ahead.  She got confirmed in the Catholic church this weekend and was very excited about it.  I haven't heard how it went so I am assuming it went well!  I decided to run some errands on Saturday so I did some shopping and then went to my friend Char Ann's house to go to church.  We did and then I went home and immediately to sleep!   On Sunday I met up with friends to have my end-of-lent pancakes, which were fabulous and, I believe, well-earned.  We went to Sorellos, we being my upstairs neighbor Gordon, my next door neighbors Amanda and Josh and my friend Noemi and her husband Balazs.  I had Bella favorite pancakes which are bananas,mango strawberry and whipped cream!  Mmmm Mmmm. After a nap of luxurious proportions I  went to Char Ann's house again, this time for Easter dinner, which was really fun because her whole family was there.  It was fun to see a family in action on Easter, even though it wasn't my own!  I can't believe how much I ate!  I ate and ate and ate.  Especially the strawberry shortcake- man was that good!  She made it with real shortcake, none of that sponge cake crap!  Finally I rolled myself out to the car and drove home.  I rounded out my Easter watching a cheesy movie, CAMP, about a musical theater camp.  It was terribly contrived and badly acted, but entertaining nonetheless.  Its hard to worry too much about the terrible acting when there's singing and dancing going on.  A nice way to end the weekend! Back to work today and feeling slow.  I have a sore throat, that better go away cause I am not in the mood!  But its sort of slowing me down today. However, the time has come for me to speed up again, as I have to go to class now!  Happy Easter to all!

          Time   I have always been fascinated by time.  I like the idea that somewhere in the world its 3AM at my 1PM.  Could there be any two times less likely to co-occur?  The 24 time zones and the unlikely events that occur because of them are very interesting to me.  For example- about 45 minutes from my house was the line between Eastern Time and Central Time.  Because we were so close to this line we got an Indiana station that showed 90210 an hour earlier, which put it right BEFORE my bedtime, rather than just after.  This changed the world for me!  My mother's well laid plans of having me in bed before "bad" things came on TV were foiled.... by time zones!   Right after college I moved to Central time.  Man, what a change!  I am not a late night girl.  My friends will tell you, when its time for bed, I am out.  Well, by living in Central time, I could talk to people who were up to "normal" hours (like 11PM or Midnight) who previously didn't get chatty until after I went to sleep!  It was very convenient! My friend Jen, who lives in California) and I rarely talk.  This is the reverse effect of time zones.  She works late and by the time she's leaving for home (say 7:30 her time), I am already close to bed.  And by the time she gets home, has something to eat and feels like talking on the phone, I am a gonner for sure!  This is odd, because she's one my  favorite people to talk to, I've been talking to her now for 7 years,but the time zones just make it next to impossible.  (So we make plans to talk on a Saturday afternoon).   Finally, as I plan my big adventure, I have to admit that talking on the phone is going to very difficult.  Where I'll be in Europe is 6 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, which puts most of my family and friends at a confusing time.  I can call them between 3 and 10 in Europe, which is when most of them will be in work, and between Midnight and 4, when they are home from work, and I am (as previously mentioned) out cold.  Luckily, this wont affect calling my Grandparents, because they are always at home.  And, as with Jen, I will call on weekends, between work hours.  So, I know it will get worked out, but it will, nonetheless, be strange.

          Captain Log:  Stardate- Firday, April 2nd, 2004. Time- 4 minutes to departure. Location- Desk, Lincoln, MA: outer region of Milky Way  I am feeling the effects of the coffee that I have consumed.  The ships medic has informed me of its side effects and still I turn to it!  Damn my weakness!  But these hours- alone- amid depthless stars- moving soundlessly, relentlessly info infinity..... how do I do this without the uplifting effects of caffeine?! Today I got word from Earth that the ships supervisor would be out, and during the course of this day, I had but one skirmish with aliens.  The rest of my day was spent planning my trip to Tenerife, the planet of beaches.  I need to brush up on my Tenerifish, as they do not speak the language of my planet.  It is very difficult, as my vocal cords were not designed for such sounds.  I feel confident that I will overcome this difficulty.  I must, the future of my planet depends upon it!   The next two days are a planned connection outage with Earth.  We will, of course, cease all official duties until we are online again.   I hope the next couple of days pass without incident, but should an incident occur, be sure that I will relay it to you faithfully.   The ships alarms are wailing!  The outage with Earth will take place shortly!  But before I go, I must tell you....................

          Rainy Day Realizations   I have always been drawn to songs and poems about leaving where you are, and going home (Examples:  Leaving, by the Indigo Girls, "Will the fire still burn on my return? Keep the path lit on the only road I know- Honey, all I know to do is go." or Ireland, by Garth Brooks, "Ireland, I am coming home!").  There is something terrifyingly exhilarating about leaving a life behind that I've come to know , and something soul-nourishing about retunring to the very first place I called  home.  Its the in-between that I have the most trouble with.  How do I, for example, take leave of a place full of people that isn't "home" and will soon be "a plaec I used to live?"  It makes a certain basic sense to me when people don't leave their hometown- If you never leave, you never have to spread your love farther than your immediate geographical region.  But, I turned my back on that possibility long ago.  When I moved to Boston, even, I had to leave Lima, Dayton, and Illinois.  At that, as now, my friends were scattered through the United States and Africa.  So, I picked one and moved here.  Now my time here is over.   I have a tendency of realizing that I am going to be leaving a place and then distancing myself from that.  I am really trying (though I think unsucessfully) not to do that here.  Its hard because so much has changed in this calendar year.  I stopped doing yoga and so stopped having a constant source of socialization, and I've been working on my thesis and getting things ready to go for my trip, I've been visiting more with Monica who lives in Connecticut and I've woked sort of crazy hours.  And its been really freakin cold!  Last year (before Christmas) I was doing early morning dance party, did a lot of fun things with people from yoga and work was more normal.  I did a lot more with my friends.  I also had just sort of stumbled across the idea of doing this crazy thing in Europe.  I really want to be more social before I go.  It would be terrible to withdraw from the fun I've had here just to make it easier to go. Because there's no way its going to be easy.  The other day Monica and I were talking about her last trip to Boston before my trip- this is the time when we are going to clear my apartment of everything except the clothes for the month of May and my bed.  WEIRD.  But anyway, during that conversation I about had a heart attack "That isn't going to be the last time I see you is it??" and she said "NO NO!  I'm taking you to the airport remember?"  Relief.  And that's just one person.  Imagine when I have that same experience with everyone who lives in Boston! Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of charging into uncharted territory (those of you from Europe are rolling your eyes).  I long for that emptiness that comes from knowing that you are not known or felt in a place, and the excitement that comes from filling that place.  But its hard to empty that place knowing that you could stay, and be full.  And harder still to remain full until the second before you leave, and feel the botton drop out as you get on the plane.

       I'm in Paris!!!  This morning I woke up and repacked my bag and then strapped all 100 pounds of it on my shoulders and off I went.  I took the Eurail from London to Paris and got in at 2:15PM, local time.  Being in Paris puts me 6 hours ahead of the East Coasters.  And as I sit here, tired from a long day, its only 2PM for them!  That's amazing to me.  I love time zones, I find them interesting.   Today after I got into Paris (Gare du Nord) I took the Metro to where my stop was supposed to be, but of course, the stop was closed, shut until June 11.  Grr.  So I got off at Pasteur and walked.... and walked and walked.  My feet hurt so badly!  But I finally found my hotel with the help of a few very confused Parisiennes.  They weren't confused before they met me, mind you, only after a few minutes of my hand waving and attempting to use the few french words I know (Tres Bien, Au Revoir, Je Suis American, Parlez vous l'anglaid and similar) to say "I can't find my hotel, the aloha hostel, can you help me?" finally someone waved in the general direction and said a few rapid fire words in french and off I went.  Sure enough, just down the street was Rue Barrome and the Aloha Hostel!   After dropping my enormous bag and falling asleep almost upon sitting down on the bed I went back to the Metro and went downtown.  I saw the Eifel Tower (which by the way you can see from the street outside the hostel), Musee Louvre, and Hotel DeVille.  As I was walking down the street a guy came up and said Excusemoi?  Je Suis Franais?  I said, Non, Americaen" and he asid something in French and I said, in English, "That's about the end of my french" and he and I walked on together, with him pointing out things and telling me what they were in French.  I did have to use my ring as a safeguard at one point (he followed with, Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry") and we walked on.  It was really nice to have someone to talk to in French, while I learned a few more phrases.  Such as "my feet hurt from all this walking" and "I have a cold" and "I don't like pidgeons." Good times!  Then I used one of my new phrases, "My feet hurt from all this walking and I need to go back to my hotel" and he directed me to my metro stop.  So now, I am back at the lovely Aloha Hostel and am about to get something to drink and then off to my room for sleep or at least getting off my sleep.  I will probably read my book. More tomorrow!  P.S. Much to extreme dismay, I missed my Jack the Ripper Walking tour last night!!! I was eating Indian and the guy took 15 minutes to get my check back and then I couldn't find the Tube and on and on until it was 9 minutes before it was going to leave and I was in the wrong part of town.  I was very upset.  But, I recovered by taking a bus marked Kings Cross and found myself at the home of Platform 9 3/4.  GET THIS- there are only 8 platforms.  :-O I KNOW!

       This morning I woke up at 8:00 from a dream.  In the dream I had missed the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace because I slept in.  In order to prevent the dream becoming a reality I got out of bed at once!  I found out last night that the shower at the hostel is literally like standing outside naked in cold, drizzly weather, so I didn't partake of one of those, thus cutting my prep time more than in half.  I was down to breakfast by 8:15.  Breakfast was a piece of toast with butter and jelly and some tea... but I'm not gonna complain- it was free!  I made it out of the hostel by 9am (After three tries- first I didn't have my Tpass, then my key, then I realized I had left my bag at breakfast), and took to London! I got off at Charing Cross and believe it or not, found myself smack dab in the middle of a sunny day in London.  I went to take a picture in trafalger square of the sunny day on the water fountains and was sad to discover that my camera is broken.  I have no idea when this could have happened, as I was dilligent and had it with me all the time.  The lens is stuck and I have to send it to the states and get a replacement camera.  And I spent £6 on a battery before realizing it wasn't the battery and then had to spend anoher £10 on a one time use camera. But I didn't let it get me down- much.   With single use camera in hand, I went to Buckingham Palace and watched men in red coats and black hats march and yell and swing their arms to the beat of the 15 piece marching band.  They played Yesterday by the beatles.  It was fun to listen to people realize what it was.  People in accents from around the globe hummed to themselves and then proclaimed 'Oh lovely, Yesterday' or 'The beatles!' or they might sing to themself 'I long for yesterday!'  It was very fun. Then I walked down to Parliament and Big Ben (Look kids!) and got a sandwich from a vendor that I ate in the sunny expanse of trafalgar square.  It was bacon, which tastes sort of different here....or maybe it was the tomato (Toe-mah-toe), something tasted a little different.  And my bacon sandwich came with cucumbers.  Very interesting.    After eating my sandwich and reading some of the  The Other Boelyn Girl  (Very good, I reccomend) I decided I would walk to the Southbank and look around.  So I crossed the river at Embankment and wandered towards the Tate Modern.  I still haven't quite shaken the jet lag/tiredness so I stopped a couple of different times and sat down.  I made it to the Tate modern but was too tired to really look around.  I am very commited to my Jack the Ripper Walking Tour, so I am trying to conserve what energy I have left for that.  I have it planned that I will go get food, then drink a coffee right before the tour, then hoof it to the hostel and go to bed.  Tomorrow I go to Paris and I need a lot of energy for Paris.  At least in London I can eavesdrop on strangers- in Paris I will have to ask them to repeat things and look things up in my dictioanry.  Which is a very inefficient way to eavesdrop, by the way.    Speaking of eavesdropping- I was on the Tube the other day and this little girl (she was maybe 8) was on the train and when it moved out of the station she sort of jumped and said 'Goodness, that gave me a fright!'   CUTE!  Its like a whole country of grandmas.   The time has come for Indian food.  I think I have sat long enough to walk to Leicester Square where Indian food can be found.  I am like a cell phone, charging up enough for one call, then dying, charging, calling.  :) More later! (I know where the I-Cafes are in London but not in Paris,I hope I find one!!!)

       I'm in London, believe it or not.  I got on the plane last night and didn't sleep more than 4 or 5 spurts of ten minutes each.  First this baby was crying, then they served dinner, then I watched  Freaky Friday  then they served breakfast, then I was like, fuck it! I'm up!  And watched an episode of Ab Fab and an episode of Friends.  Then TOUCH DOWN, and the games begin.    IT TOOK ME 2 HOURS TO GET OUT OF HEATHROW .  First I had to queue up for the passport control, then queue up for Customs, then I walked for 5 miles with my 100LB backpack to the tube, then queued up for the Tube ticket, was in the wrong line, queued up again for the tube ticket, got it, and made the 26 stop trek (Picadilly to Bakerloo) to Kensal Green and the Millennium Lodge Hostel.  I met a nice man on the T who was willing to heft my bag back onto my shoulders and I didn't fall over.  Good times!  By the time I got to the Lodge, I was exhausted, and now I am quickly blogging (50P for 30 min) and then I am going to TRY to go do something.  But I am so tired!  I might just go get some dinner and then sleep- tomorrow is a busy day! Its on my list to go and see the Shakespeare show, I feel that that shceme in particular has little chance of success.  I might make it downtown.  Course, I might just make it to my bed, with my journal, my cheese buiscuits and my peanuts (Dinner).  I love it so far, truly, how exciting.  More excitement tomorrow.....  NOTE: This a foreign keyboard and things are all moved around.. sorry for any typos!!

       This morning I woke up excited.  Today I am leaving Boston to go to Connecticut and tomorrow I will fly.  The end of an era.  As the day progressed, I felt an erie sense of ease.  I packed up the remainder of my apartment with little distress.  The bags are packed and all that remains is for Scott to come and collect me.  I feel ready.     I had my going away party last night and had a wonderful time.  I got a beautiful charm bracelet from 2 of my great friends and book from another, and a sleep sack from yet anohter.  Cards galeore and many hugs.  It was a wonderful goodbye, and a fitting one.  No one said "I don't want you to go!" because they all want me to go.  They want me to go have a great time, savor every minute, and of course- blog all about it!  And I shall.   To Amanda: Thank you for being my neighbor and friend. To Char Ann: Thank you for being my confidant and advisor To Noemi: Thank you for opening the door to me To Katy: Thank you for allowing me to know you To Daniel: Thank you for believing in me To Paul, Ruseell, Arthur, Jeff, Daniel, Eun Mi Park, Dana, Lisa, Joshua, Gordon, Pilar, Shirley, Margaret, Bruce, Eddie and Alisa: Thank you for being the people who made this city a home  To Boston: Thank you for being the first home I made for myself.  I will never be the same.

       It is May 26th, 2004.  I am sitting at my friend Noemi's, writing e-mail, and waiting for her safe return so that we can journey to the Whitehorse Tavern for my going away party.  Another set of mass goodbyes.  What will become of me?   I love my life, every party of it and I hate to leave it.  At the same time I am incredibly excited about going to Europe.  Therefore my day has been spent oscillating between feeling downtrodden, rising up to excitement, falling back down again.  I have gone to the post office, yelled at the post office guy (he really didn't deserve it- he just suggested quite kindly that I use the other stamp on the other package).  Went to the bank- yelled at the bank guy (No Euros or Pounds on hand).  Went to Brooks to drop off film- you guessed it- yelled at the photo lady (the machine was broken).  I should have stayed in bed.  On the other hand I talked to Joshua, and screamed like a lady with delight at seeing him.  We screamed like ladies with delight about me being Barcelona on Thursday.   The other thing I did today was take care of the last vestiges of a US connection.  There was a boy who I was interested in who wasn't totally clear about whether he was interested in me and I made the decision to stop thinking about him.  I realized that i was using it as a desperate way to prove I matter in the states and it wasn't worth it.  It felt good and sad all at the same time.  So- Look out European Men, Amanda is on the prowl.  Especially if you have a castle and a royal lineage. I can't believe it.  I cannot believe it.  I absolutely cannot believe it.  I will be in London in three days.  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! The roller coaster continues..... Update on Going Away party tomorrow!! YAY!

       Tomorrow I go to Connecticut, the last frontier in the USA, before I launch into foreign waters.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  I must believe it.  So strange to think that everything I know, understand, and believe will come under question and perhaps change.  I am excited and I can't wait for the fun to begin! Tonight is the Going away party!  7PM at the Whitehorse Tavern on Brighton Ave in Allston.  Come and celebrate the end of a fabulous era in my life!

       The Bon Voyage Waxing Paty was a rousing, if painful success!  Many a man would have wanted access to the confines of the Waxing Party and his admittance was one that was short lived and missed the main event.  It is safe to say that the BVFF girls are ready for summer, even a summer including bikinis. A big thank you must go to Noemi, the chief root ripper, and Amanda C., hostess with the mostess.

       I am writing from my Grandparents computer in Lima, OH!  Here's the synopsis of my trip to OH.  On Tuesday when I got in my Mom and I hung out and played Yahtzee.  Damn if she didn't get 4 Yahtzee's in ONE GAME.  INSANITY.  She beat me, needless to say.  Interestingly, in the game when she got the 4 yahtzees, I got 4 blanks (It was a two row game, for those of you who know what that means).  Then on Wednesday my Mom and I went up and visited my Grandma at the hospital with my Grandpa.  She's doing OK.  Not great, and she's clearly frustrated with being in the hospital.  Thursday night I hung out with my Grandpa and he read and I finished my book- the Queens Fool.  Friday I went to visit my Grandma with Grandpa again and then took to the road to Columbus.  Hung out with Dave on Friday night (we went to a Japaneese steak house where he felt the need to get a "pen" from his car that if he ate seafood I was required to jam into his leg) and that was a lot of fun.  Saturday I went to see my friend Sara who is home from the Peace Corps and we went to Victorias secret and took a nap.  Saturday night we travelled to Lima and helped get ready for the party which took place on Sunday.  The party was a lot of fun and involved every person I've known in my whole life, or there-abouts.  It was great to see everyone and was hailed as a big success.  It was also a truly sad moment because my Grandma couldn't come.   Today I am hanging out with my Dad, e-mailing and preparing for my return to Boston flight tomorrow.  I had a great time, but I cannot believe how quickly time flies when you are seeing old friends and saying goodbye.

       Today marks the 100th post to Uberbliss.com/Amanda.  After a quick update on my goings on, I would like to take this time to remember some blogs from the past.  They meant somethingg to me at the time, and I like to remember.  Quick update: As yesterday was my last day of work, today I am busy preparing for life in Europe.  Today I am trying to condense my CDs into ten CDs for the road.  I am already a little tired of doing it- its hard work picking and choosing.  But necessary work as I do not have enough space to take all my CDs.  Noemi is kindly allowing my intrusion into her space to burn CDs as I don't have a computer. I finally did the mountainous laundry and am now capable of actually packing for OH, if not Europe.  I leave for OH tomorrow and find my time slipping most tenaciously away.  I grow, if possible, even more excited and not a little nervous.  Now- on to the retrospective!   My very first blog of any import!      I don't like baseball.  I don't understand it, therefore I don't like to watch it, therefore I don't find it interesting to talk about/hear about.  HOWEVER, as some of you may know, the Boston Red Sox are involved in a series of games against the Yankees (who, I am told, Suck).  The victor will get to play in another series of games, probably against the Chicago Cubs.  That series is referred to in the sporting world as the World Series (=world because there is a team in Canada).  It has been brought to my attention that if I don't care about this series of competitions, I am a traitor and will be required to move immediately. Now, what's a girl to do? Well, I have devised a plan that I hope will get me through these troubled times.  I offer them to my corner of the world as possible solutions for this dilemma. 1)  Allow the men (and women) the right to be obsessed.  I have seen the futility of attempting conversation before (and GOD FORBID, during) a game.  It it psychologically impossible for a Red Sox fan to focus on anything else during the "critical window."  2 hours before, 2 hours after and during the game.  The truth is: Go find something else to do, you're not gone succeed with that crowd. 2)  Learn the following phrases:        - Cowboy Up        - Yankees Suck        - Go Sox        - and, if currently unfamiliar:  Home Run, World Series and Baseline hit.   Note:  You do not have to know what these phrases mean.  For example, I do not know what a baseline hit is.  3)  When forced to have a conversation, use these newly learned phrases to sound somewhat knowledgeable.  A few sample comments:  "The Red Sox need to Cowboy up!"  or "I hope they beat the Yankees, they suck!" or, "The Yankees have hit a few serious baseline hits!" or simply, "Go Sox!"  Note:  These comments will fool NO ONE.  These are merely some phrases that make you seem like you give a flying hoot about this series of competitions.  It should ensure that you do not have to flee town. 4) Finally, make jokes.  Mock your own ignorance.   Example:   "You better go or you'll miss kickoff!" "Pedro sure can handle a bat!" "I hope there's a good halftime show!" etc. and finally, 5) Be patient.  There's about a week left in this series. WHEN the Sox win it, there will be about another week  for the WORLD SERIES.  Take heart- baseball will be over in less than a month.  In the meantime, Cowboy Up.     Birthdays      The magic birthday cake!    BIRTHDAYS!!!  I love birthdays!  This weekend two of my very good friends had birthdays.  I attended two birthday parties and helped to plan one of them.  They were both fantastic and I believe that both people felt loved and valued.  And that's what birthday's are about!  Every day we should try to remember how serendipitous it is that we have arrived at these crossroads and found good friends here.  I try to be cognizant of the fact that friends are not bound to us by anything but their will, and I am grateful that my friends have chosen to care about me.  All friends, every day.  However, on somebody's birthday its time to focus on how lucky you are to have that person in particular in your life.  Its a celebration of the fact that this person exists and a celebration that you know them.  For that day, I try to put myself out there and be a cheerleader, a poet, and a planner.  I say nice things, I call and sing on voicemails, I buy presents and I think about them.  I was lucky enough to be allowed to help plan one of the birthday parties and that was super fun!  Her husband and I hung banners, made food, and conspired to keep her out of the house.  He and I bonded over our shared fondness for her.   I think birthday's are magic, and I am delighted to report that I am having one in the very near future!  I try to use my own birthday to outright celebrate myself.  Hooray for me!  I'm glad I'm me!  I don't think that we (or at least I know that I don't) celebrate ourselves enough.  I suggest that we use our birthday to NOT look at our abs suspiciously (are you getting larger?), NOT admonish naps, NOT worry about money and NOT wonder whether our neighbors think we are too loud.  At least, this is what I am going to do on Nov 5th, and you are welcome to come do it with me!   World News      THE WIDE WORLD   The world we live in, when you get right down to it is as ellusive as one's lifetime.  I will explain.  When, at 25, you think about your lifetime it seems impossible to plan it all.  It seems like it might never end, or else it will end tomorrow in a fiery explosion.  Its rare that we 25 year olds sit and ponder the actual end of our life.  Heart attacks that weaken the immune system that lead to bouts of pneumonia that eventually kill us.  Maybe its better that we not think about it.  :) Regardless, I believe that life goes fast and that its not that much time and that really, we better get to it if we are going to live the life that want to live.   Much like the world.  I love globes, I think they are beautiful and philosophical instruments of peace.  When I look at a globe and see that Australia (though tiny) is considered a continet and that Ohio, the state  is  actually sort of heart shaped, and that peru is really, really long, it hits me strongly that this world is full of people.  People like me in oddly shaped land masses that differ only on their weather patterns and social history.  I do not claim that these differences can be ignored, or that they are trivial in the minds of people.  But it does make me see how similar we all are, despite the differences that we get hung up on.  It makes me want to meet these people and ask them questions.  It makes me frustrated that I can't speak most of their languages.  It makes me yearn to get out of the spot I am in and at least try to understand.  Which brings me to the comment about elusivity.   When we think about the world and we haven't seen much of it, its easy to say "Its too big, there's no way."  Much like planning for an entire life.  But, like life, if we don't get out there and try we could miss it!  And the world is large, but it is also small.  It no longer takes three and a half months on an ocean liner to get to Europe.  It a 6 hour plane ride for 400.00.  And once you've seen one place, I bet you will want to see more.  And then piece by piece you can begin to capture our collective truth.  You can begin to understand.  And if you start now, and you "get on it" then you have a good chance of capturing that truth before your heart attacks begin (I venture to say that your heart will benefit from getting off your fat ass) and your immune system goes and all you have left is waiting for pneumonia.  Just ask the older people in your family (or I'll lend you one of mine)- What you have is a life, what you dont' have is time.   and finally, proof that  even I  can be wrong   Anyway, the first cut.  I wonder how much of an effect he had had on the subsequent boyfriends.  The way things ended, I don’t believe he ever cared about me, he was (and is, if the roommates accounts are true) a man of convenience.  And I am nothing if not inconvenient.  I was always going through some kind of drama, while becoming me. And since my life is dedicated to become me in all my glory, I continue to go through drama.  Every other boyfriend found it charming- until he didn’t.  And when he didn’t I just went ahead and said goodbye.  But the first cut.  Man oh maneshevitz (as my friend Alisa says), I would have sat around being inconvenient to him forever.  At that time I was so amazed that someone like him would even look at someone like me* that I couldn’t bring myself to realize how bad his need for convenience was for me.  Luckily, I wasn’t the person who sat around for 5 years waiting for him to be a decent human being, the roommate was.   I don’t know why he would want to come and see me, I can only hope that he had something worthwhile to say for himself.

       This weekend I was informed that I had fallen short on my reporting duties.  Indeed, it is true.  Many an important event has occurred and missed mention on this illustrious website.  Where can my faithful readers go for hard hitting news if not Uberbliss?  So, without further ado.....   Yahtzee!  The Yahtzee world champions met again in Boston, MA on May 2nd to seek the world title.  This time the countries of Italy, Ireland, the USA, Hungary and the first ever European Union  uber Champion sent representatives.  In shocking performances, both the Hungarian and USA representatives (forerunners in the first world championships) had terrible games and lost to the newest of world champions, the representative from Ireland!  Congratulations to Joshua on winning the coveted blue pencil! In a most unusual move, the jailed donkey was seen lending support to the champion from the United States!  It is now believed that his support was not genuine, rather he was acting as a spy for the Hungarian champion.   Bon Voyage Film Festival!   The Bon Voyage Film Fesival culminated last week with L'Auberge Esagnole, a comedic portrayal of life in an international apartment in Barcelona.  Nominally "starring" Audrey Toutou and a cast of other international youngins, the movie is well worth a viewing.  It is a french movie, set in Spain with English subtitles.  :)  The evening festivities included chocolate covered strawberries and remarkably good pink lemonade. Future events of the association include the Bon Voyage Cluedo and Karoake Festival (May 18), Bon Voyage Waxing party (May 25), and the Bon Voyage GEDDOUTTAHEAH (Boston for "Going Away") party (May 26).  All are welcome.     Last Day at Work  Alas, alack, the day has come.  Amanda Holman, esteemed purveyor of this site, ends her tenure at the Massachusetts Partnership for Achievement in Reading today.  The ramifications of the this day are far reaching.  1) Amanda will not have access to a computer with guaranteed regularity, making blogs less regular and perhaps less image oriented. This saddens noboddy more than Amanda herself.   2) Amanda will no longer have health insurance.  She will be relying on voodoo magic and good luck.  So, those of you who have curses on her, please lift them until she can nestle safely within the forcefield of western medicine once more. 3) Amanda will no longer have a car, relying insteadr on the public transportation systems of Western Europe. 4) Amanda will no longer have a home.  She can be found in hostels dotting the european landscape for a week, then in a language school, followed by an apartment in Santiago de Compostela.  All contact information will be posted to this website.   5) Amanda will no longer have the joy of working with the staff of Lexia, the PAR trainers, the DOE, or Jeff Dieffenbach, the most particular boss for whom I've ever had the pleasure of working.   In Sickness and in Health  For those of you who are inclined to do so, please send a happy thought/prayer/meditative moment of clarity into the cosmos towards God, the gods, or the universe for my Grandmother.  She has been in and out of the hospital for the past two weeks.  There's talk of her being better, but I am deeply concerned.  She is tied with my Mother, Brother, and Grandfather for most important and influential person in my life.  Pain for her translates directly into pain for me.  To lose her would be to lose so much of myself that it is safe to assume my life could never be the same (note: there is currently no evidence that any losing will occur soon).  Please join me in wishing, praying, pleading- nay begging for her safe return to health.

       Good things are happening at Blogger.com, the blogging site I use to publish this website.  They have new templates and new features for those templates.  I have spent the majority of today getting this one the way I like it.   Please note the following.     Below "where'd she go" there is a clickable list of old blogs. When you click on this you get the blog plus all the comments.  Very cool for a blog like the one where I ask you to tell me about your hometowns.    The titles of the blogs are now regular title- they're even orange (!), whereas they used to be just bolded.    I can use bullets now!    I can also use a "block quote" like in the newpapers! A rousing chorus of   WOW!   erupts from the crowd!   fun stuff- and if you want to blog like I blog you should contact jeff@jeffjudge.com and pay him 60.00 for the year to use space on  uberbliss, and have access to his invaluable help! I am off to begin my weekend! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!! (picture kermit the frog dancing) Amanda

       I am sitting outside in the sun, on my late lunch break.  Because of our wireless network I can sit outside and blog!  It's fabulous!  I can't believe it's already Friday on my last full week of work.  This week  has been really good, at work and after work.  It was the kind of week I have aspired to since I moved to Boston.  Every night I had something to do with a good friend, except for one night when I watched TV and had "alone" time.  It was perfect- 2 nights of one-on-one time, one night of group time, one night of me time.    I am a lucky, lucky girl.  I have a family who supports me in my adventurous schemes, friends to spend time with, music on the radio, and sushine on my arms.  What more could a girl ask for?

       As almost anyone who reads this blog already knows, last night I finished my final final exam.  I am now completely done with school.  And I think I aced it- yipee!   I have been in school, excepting a year and a half, for 22 years- straight.  I don't really know what it will be like to not go to class, not have something I should be doing, not have an academic goal towards which to strive.  But, honestly, I think I'll figure it out!  More than one person has written to me to say "Oh, Amanda, never say never!" They all seem to think I might have to listen to a boring lecture from a boss, or attend a seminar to learn about a computer program or HEAVEN FORBID, want to go back to school. OH MY GOSH- I just realized.  Picture me laughing my office- I am going back to school to sit through lectures, write papers, etc in 2 months!  Language school in Tenerife!  I totally didn't realize!  How funny.  I guess that's proof that I like school so much that I will likely be in some form of it forever.  I would like to get an MBA at Simmons, would like to go to Cooking school, learn how to scuba dive (that requires lessons) and take "appreciation courses" like "Understanding watercolor" or "French films" or "The cultural underpinnings of Harry potter."   Nonetheless, I must maintain, even in light of recent evidence, that this is the end of an era!  I'm gonna take a deep breath, relax, lie on the beach and celebrate- I am done with graduate school!

       To prove that I am capable of thinking about something other than my forthcoming trip to the Continent, here are some musings from the last week.  I tried to keep note so that none of my valuable thoughts would vanish forever.  A losing battle, but a noble one.   Agressively erradicating passivity  When one (I) stops and takes note of one's (my) conversational tactics, one might be surprised to note that one engages in one of one's own pet peeves with alarming regularity.  (All english teachers please take note of the awkwardness of your favorite pronoun- one.  I shall now revert to the comfort of first person.)  Here emerges my confession: Depsite my irritation and downright philosophical opposition to passive agressive behavior, I have noted my own self behaving passive agressively in conversation recently. Here are some examples: 1) In conversation with a friend, I set up a theroretical situation that bothers me and had in mind something he had done in the past.  I assumed that the desciption of the theoretical would call to his mind the actual and he would either bring it up (the point) or not.  This places the responsibility of clearing the air completely with him and such, the awkwarness of the introduction of such a topic.  I did apologize for what could have looked like a trap and tried to avert it, but that does not clear me of the attempt in the first place. 2) My friend who was in town this weekend was talking when I was trying to listen to a radio commercial and I said sharply "OK Monica I need to hear this" and then of course, felt really bad.  The passive agression comes from the rest of the day when I felt like I had to make it up to her, but felt awkward apologizing so late in the game.  (NOTE: I totally did not have to hear the commercial, but I had divided my hearing in two parts and was frustrated that I couldn't follow both)   So, in each of these situations one might ask "Why didn't you just say "This thing you did a long time ago made me upset and makes me question our relationship now" and "I'm sorry I snapped at you over a Jordan's Furniture Ad" instead of covertly attempting to bring about the subject and hoping they'll get the point. You see, I really try to be honest and forthrright, despite the fact that this gets me in more trouble than the passive agressiveness ever has.  For example, when I didn't want to watch a movie recently and I said so, I got in trouble for missing the point.  But at least it was honest trouble! Passive agressiveness (PA) breeds passive agressiveness. When one person in talking in PA code then the other person, who never misses the point, starts retaliating in PA code and before you know it the two of you are fighting like cats over the who didn't screw the milk cap on tightly enough.   I think that my point (which I arrived at during this blog) is that the source of my PA behavior is fear that the person will trod on my feelings and so I hide behind the protection of PA code.  I must seek to be an even better, more forthright communicator and realize that the quality people (the ones I want to keep around) will be less offended by the truth than by misdirected communication efforts. Oh, and Monica, I am sorry that I snapped at you. :)   Epistemological Forays  Words, words words.  For a long time I was too proud to ask people what words meant.  I would just use my context clues and try to figure it out while nodding intelligently.  Sometimes I would fail miserably and the person would either scoff, and sweep away (picture Snape) or say "You have no idea what I am talking about do you?" The offshoot of such a character flaw is that I have developed a true love for trying to figure out words.  I think about what it could have meant and why it could mean that, while taking into account my almost entirely self taught understanding of latin roots and foreign languages (I say almost entirely self taught because in some of GRE Prep we learned some stuff about prefixes and afixes, etc).  Here are some examples:  Wine.  I was thinking about why cider isn't called apple wine, since its essentially fermented wine. Then I thought that wine is probably an adaptation f vino, which probably came from vine-o (or the Italian equivalent) and apples grow on trees.  So perhaps we could call it tree-o, or arbol-o (I only the spanish word for tree, not the Italian one) and then make it into an English equivalent like Arbole.  But cider is O.K. too.    The bones and muscles of the human body  OK, so this one is also related to the last one, in that it refers to the kinds of things I am thinking about as I am walking around by myself.  I have absolutely NO IDEA what happens inside this contraption that gives my soul somewhere to live.  My understanding of biology is something akin to "the hip bones connected to the leg bone, the leg bones connected to the ankle bone."  Seriously.  But that doesn't stop me from trying to figure it out, as I roam around utilizing my body.  So, here's what I think is interesting.  You know how little kids have that game where they have gears and pulleys and they can make a contraction designed to get a ball to roll down a system and into a hole?  Well, I sort of think of the human body that way.  I want to know things like EXACTLY HOW do the muslces a bones combine to make my toes stay spread out and WHY is it harder to keep my toes spread out than my fingers.  And why is exercise good for the legs but bad for the hands?  (I.e. stronger legs and carpal tunnel syndrome) Also, WHY does one isolated part, like an inch square of my leg, or something the size of a qurter on my tow itch like crazy sometimes?  and WHY does a feather going down the arm bring about goosebumps?  Oh, and why do smells register in my memory more accurately than sounds or sights?  And WHY OH WHY do I have such word recall problems?  Just questions, and I amuse myself by coming up with answers based only on my fancy and very rudimentary knowledge.  I have similar questions in the field of physics (with slightly more knowledge), in fact I just recently had one answered about rockets.  Turns out that if I wanted to I really could send a teddy bear into space and have it orbit around the earth.  And I know how.... sort of.   Perpetual Personification  I love to personify my things.  My friends are quite used to me proclaiming, for example, that "my hair brush stated that it would take no more!  It was retiring and I was to get a new one or face the consequences!"  They will, as sane people do, take this to mean that I threw my hairbrush away because it was getting old.  But in my mind I am delighted with the idea of a talking hairbrush!  And in my mind, I actually have the experience.  My most recent brush with delightful personification was my garage sale this weekend.  I sold all kinds of things I liked- my fancy chair with ottoman, my dressers, my table and chairs, and a few of my stuffed animals.  I amused myself for a good 15 minutes thinking of the new adventures my possessions would have in their new homes.  It made me feel better about letting them go, as they were embarking on fun and excitement as well.  This has been a lifelong trait- as my brother will tell you.  He used it to his advantage a number of times.  Many were the tears shed over Lazzy Bear proclaiming to my brother than he didn't want to live with me anymore, but would rather live with Ryan.   Jerk.  :)    I have probably wasted enough of PAR time on this blog!  I hope you foudn it just as interesting as I did.  :)  Relationships

       Saturday, Monica and I went through all of my stuff and got it ready for a garage sale that took place on Sunday (A success!  I made $140.00). There is now tumbleweed rolling across the landcape of Apt. 105.  Today I signed off on my final payroll adjustment and will be paid in full when checks come out this Friday.    Tonight I have my final final exam of all time.  I am becoming, in equal parts, excited and nervous.  To add another final to this blog, please take note of the following: On May 26, 2004, at 7PM at the Whitehorse Tavern (Brighton Ave, Allston Village) I am having a going away party.  Come, eat, drink, be merry with me on my last night in Boston.

        Cape Cod   Its Monday, the day of preparation for Title One, my very last event for Massachusetts Partnership for Achievement in Reading!  As of tomorrow afternoon I will be in the Cape until Friday afternoon. 3 nights in a hotel eating room service and watching HBO.  I am, truthfully, excited about it.  I am going to watch the Friends Finale on a large TV too, excitement (I have a 13" at home)! I will be staying at the Ramada, which isn't the nicest hotel but its the hotel that our events are taking plaec and so that's convenient.  I wont really have e-mail between now and then so if anyone wants to talk to me you will have to call my cell phone.  Also, the lack of internet means no blogging either.

       Yesterday I went to see Joshua in his movement final performance.  It was very intense and very moving, I though.  He is of the best in class, I think.  He moves with such strengh, its incredible.  Those of you who saw him in Ipswitch know what I mean.  Amazing.  He´s pretty overwhelmed, I think, and he has two more final exams this week- one Thursday and one Friday.  I am going to both of them!   As we walked home from the final/performance we decided to pass by the Catedral and look at it at night... unbeknownst to us someone else had decided to stop by- LUCIANO PAVARATI!!!  We couldn´t get close enough to see him but we heard him.  He was singing in the plaza in front of the Catedral.  AMAZING.  Its all part of the Xacebo festival this month.  I hear Janet Jackson stopped by last week some time to party with the pilgrims as well.  Good times!! Today I walked aroun town and did a little shopping.  I bought some fabulous postcards and 2 shirts.  I got one that says ¨brazil¨ and celbrates the futbol (Soccer) team. an another one that has a little bit longer sleeves- its  bit cold here- that i really like a lot.  I got them both at a place called BuenAventura!  Good adventure..... fiting, yeah? Tonight I am going to a movie by myself and I am going to eat popcorn!  Yay!

       Yesterday, after getting merrily lost walking around Santiago de Compostela I returned to la Casa de Joshua and met his roommate.  He was a little surprised to see me, a stranger, in his house but he recovered admirably and was even kind enough to explain to me the reason and heritage of languages in Spain (there are something like 8 languages in this country).  He drew maps and everything!  Good fun.  Joshua came home and we had lunch an then his roomate (Sergio) offered to take me with him to Sanxexo, a coastal town with a beach!  I agreed an then went off with Joshua´s other friend, Lesley, the girl who´s apartment I am renting.  She is moving home to the states on Friday (She is also giving me an English client of hers!).  So we went to see her apartment and meet her roommate (soon to be my roommate), who is very nice and named Oscar!  Then Sergio called from downstairs and I went down to meet him and we had a grand time walking around the coastal town, eating ice cream and looking at boats.  Sergio and I share a similar love of ice cream, tourist activiies, and men.   After we wandered around a little we went back to Santiago.  Lesley was having a going away party so Joshua and I went there for a little while and then, declaring this enough activity for one day, I went to bed.   This morning I have had breakfast and now I am going to go look at this intriguing building set down a lane.  Could be a monastary.  We´ll see!

       I am here!  I am not sure there could be two places more distinctive than Tenerife and Santiago.  Here in Santiago I am wearing jeans and I have a sweater with me, there are nuns running around in full habits and the cafes have protected tables within concrete walls.  There´s a libreria (bookstore) on every corner filled with books on spirituality and the ¨walk¨ (the pilgrimage from everywere to Santiago).  Its quite cloudy and a bit windy.  In Tenerife, in sharp contrast, I wore tank tops and shorts and never wore my tennis shoes except to climb the Teide. All the cafes were outdoor and the walls were thin and the floors were marble.  There were two librerias and they were filled with postcards and translated Daniel Steele novels.    At first glance, I like Santiago.  I have wandered down into town and around.  I have been into 3 or 4 bookstores, one of my favorite pastimes and I have scouted out the tourism office and a place to rent bikes and cars.  I have located the post office and found (obviously) an internet cafe.  I think I will enjoy it a great deal!  Everyone has been friendly and my Spanish is good enough to  almost  understand directions when they are given to me.  :)

       Friday I had my last class at the Don Quijote school for Extranjeros.  I really learned a lot, but I am still nervous about going to Santiago, where fewer people will know English and more people will be Spanish.  Nervous and excited.  As soon as I can master the tensese I ¨know¨ I will feel better.  Also, I have some problems with some very common words that I am going to sort out.  But anyway, I am all learned.  I have a certigicate to prove it.... 60 hours of language instruction! After class Anneleise and I met with Annika and her friend from Holland, Marleise, as well as Shannon and Marcio for dinner at the ¨best Canarian restaurant in town¨ according to Sylvia, our professora.  It was different... I had Ranchero (a chicken-noodle style soup), pollo in mojo, papas canarias and some flan.  The flan was not very good and when we went to meet the others from the school I had some absolutely fabulous banana flambe... honestly the best desert in Tenerife.  Its the restaurant next to Azucar, the Cuban dance club, if you are ever in Tenerife and want to go.  I passed my little black book around and collected e'mail addresses and phone numbers from people, hugged everyone goodbye and went home. Early Saturday morning Anneleise, Annika, Marleise, Michael and I rented a car and off we went to the Teide.  Wow.  The mountain is every single color a rock could be... white, red, grey, black, brown.  Beautiful.  And its so high that the air is thin and you have to move very slowly so as not to get dizzy.  You are above the clouds and on clear day, which we had, you can see Gran Canaria.  And on an even clearer day you can see the coast of Africa!  We didn´t see that.  I took a lot of pictures of Michael and Anneleise and I (Annike and Marleisee went on ahead while we sat catching our breath at the top) and will try to scan some in so you can see it.  We were up there until about 5PM and then took the cable car back down to the road.  We drove down to the town and dropped the others off and then Annneleise and I walked back up to the house.  She packed and I took a nap (I had only gotten 4 hours of sleep the night before, but was surprisingly alert and happy all day... but as soon as I saw the couch I was done!) and then we went to dinner at THE BEST RESTAURANT IN Pto. De Cruz.-  Ricón Argentina.  It was our second time eating there and it was the best Sangria, the best meat, the best potatos.... so good.  Then we walked around and gazed at the neighborhood I have called home for 3 weeks in preparation for an inevitable goodbye. Back at the house Anneleise and I said goodbye and went to bed.  When I woke up this morning, she was gone.  I packed my stuff, cleaned the apt, and now i am down at the town scouting and taking pictures of that which I took for granted.  I fly at 5:45 today for Santiago de Compostela... and I am excited.  It was the perfect amount of time for Tenerife and Don Quijote.  Joshua has found me an apt and an ¨client¨ for English lessons.  A little money to slow the flow of money out of my account.  I talked to him last night and he said that right below the window to his apartment they had set up a stage and he can literally spit on the singer... but he doesn´t.  Instead he and his roommates are performing back up dance moves and singing along.  Hooray! Sounds like my kind of town!

       Wednesday was the dia de San Juan.  For the preceding 2 weeks I had heard about this festival and how fun it would be.  I was a little skeptical because I´m not that into big frat party style festivals (Mardi Gras, etc) but I went and I am so glad that I did.  It was absoltely amasing.  Even if I had had a miserable time in Tenerife the three weeks would  have been worth it for this festival.   We arrived at the Playa Jardin, the largest beach in Pto De La Cruz at about 9PM.  There were probably 2000 or more people there.  The entire beach was jam packed with people on towels and many people had made little fires in the sand.  Some of them were fires with wood or paper, and others were indents in the sand where the people had placed candles.  Some people had put flowers all over the inside of the fire hole as welll.  Beautifull.  We put our towels down right in from of this structure that looked like a spider made of scafolding.   Inside the scafold spider, on a stage, there was a guy wearing wings reading a newspaper.  He contined to read the newspaper until the sun went completely down and then he jumped up and started shouting ¨Es Ahora! Es Ahora!¨and yelled for everyone to come into the center of the spider.  Anneliese and I jumped up and went into the center of the spider while the music started and he began to explain that we were in for a great show if we could get the angels to fall from heaven.  So he led us in an exercise to call the angels from heaven.  And lo and behold, they CAME!  They fell down from the sky and landed on the upper arms of the scaffold spider and flew around inside it for awhile.  Then, once they had all fallen they began to put on the most amazing show.  It was a very moving acrobatics show.  Lots of flying around, sometimes on swings.  One part of the show was a romantic dance between two angels, one with red hair, one with blue hair.  They danced and flew around together and apart and it was beautiful.  Then there was a guy who about gave me a heart attack, because he was swinging on a loose rope and fell forward and caught himself by his feet!  He kept doing it and I was a nervous wreck the whole tiem.  Then, at the end there were two mortals hanging out with the angels, one was a clown and the other a futbol player.  They each were killed and became angels.  They seemed happy about it.  :) After the show was over a band started playing traditional Spanish muscic and a couple of us went to looka round.  We walked amid the people and their fires and ended up, serendipitously in exactly the right place at exactly the right time.  We had stopped to survey the beach right where is stars to slope down to the water and suddenly the fireworks went off right in frong of us!!!!  BEAUTIFUL fireworks.  The, as if on cue, once the fireworks were over the whole beach got up and headed towards the water.  So I ran back and put on suit (no one else would coem with me) and went for a swim at midnight!  I was cleansed of my sins for another year and had a fabulous time in the water.  The waves were strong and it was like being in the center of the world, with no control over your movement.  I loved it.  Then I returned to the shore and the music had changed to a Brazillian band and so we all danced in the sand!  The music was fabulous and Marcio, a brazillain taught us all how to dance.  I, as usual, couldn´t figure it out!  We danced for about an hour and then went back to our spot in the sand and THEN there were more fireworks!!!!  Also very amazing and magical.  After the second fireworkd people started to leave.  We hung out and talked and walked around and looked at fires until about 3AM when we headed home.   It was amazing.  It was beautiful.  It was inspiring.  I know that you cannot know what I mean, because you weren´t there... but I kept thinking how every single person should be a part of this magic.

       Holy Moly is it ever hot in Tenerife.  Today I think its probably 85 degrees, and not a cloud in the sky.  Usually its maybe 78 and its surprising what a difference these few degrees difference makes.  Of course both of these are based on my uninformed understanding of celcius to farenheit conversions.   Tonight there is a huge party on the playa Jardin, the largest beach in Pto De Cruz, to celebrate the longest day, or the equinox or whatever it is today.  It involves throwing flowers and money into the water for a good summer.  I shall be throwing some money in and hoping for things to stay as good as they have been so far.

       So yesterday was an interesting day.  I got to school at 9AM, per usual, and found out that my class had been switched to the afternoon! So, I sat around sulking about that for a few hours.  I didn´t think that I would like class in the afternoon, and I didn´t want to find out!  So there!  While sulking, I watched a movie called Esposadas, which is a play on words, because it means both marriage and being locked up.  It was 30 minutes long and was nominated for an Oscar.  It was a very good story about a woman who controls all the money in her marriage because she works and he does not.  At first its just a little money, she words at the grocery store, but then she wins the lottery and still she wont give him any money to do anything with.  She keeps all the key for the deposit box around her neck, and later the combination for the wall safe.  So, of course, he tries to kill her and gets locked up.  All the time he wanted to go to Brazil, which was fun for the guy in my class Marcio, who is from Brazil.   By the way, he says that its true that Brazil will not return you to your country if you have committed a crime.  FYI. So the movie pulled me out of my sulkiness a little bit and then I went shopping and bought face wash, a book, a pencil and some moisturizer.  Shopping therapy fully intact, I returned to school for class at 2.  Class was really good.  I have two new professoras and they are both very fun.  I espcially liked my second professora-whose name, I belive, is Celia.  The two names are Sylvia and Celia, so you can imagine how I get them confused!  Class was very fun, and not at all as bad as I expected it to be.   After class a group of us went to dinner and since Marcio was with us (he speaks only Brazillian and Spanish) we all spoke Spanish.  It was very, very fun, and helpful.  I think I needed to have to rely on Spanish to develop an ear.  Afterwards I went home and talked with my roommate about some gossip at the school and then went to bed.   This morning I woke up later, put my clothes away that I had washed and then went to the pool.  I sat by the pool and tanned my legs and did some homework, then came to school and checked e-mail, ate a sandwich and I have class in 10 minutes.  RIGHT THIS SECOND I am going to go downstairs to the supermercado and get a chocolate candy bar and a Coca Light.  They cancel each other out you know.

       This weekend has been much, much fun!  On Friday, my roommate Petra had her last night in Tenerife and we had a little fiesta to celebrate.  It also turns out that Thursday was her birthday, but she didn´t say a thing!!  Suddenly there was cake and singing and all kinds of fun, but only because someone found out and spilled the beans.  Great fun.  But anyway, on Friday we went to a beach side bench and drank drinks out of melons and coconuts.  Then we tried to go Karaoke (as drunk people are prone to do) but it was closed!  ¡Que Lastima!  So went to Azucar and hung out until Petra and decided that the lameness of Azucar could hold us no longer and off we went to Carpe Diem.  Much more laid back and fun, though Scubaman was there.  Yes, the evil doer of bad  scuba deeds.  We ignored each other and I had the last two fatal drinks to make me officially drunk.  We were going to go dancing at 1AM, but it turns out that all the people of Tenerife had gone to a festival in Oratava so we did not, as no one was there.   The following morning Petra packed up her belongings and flew to Germany.  Our other roommate and I (Anneleise from Suiza) went with a gaggle of Germans and a Dutch girl on a tour of North Tenerife.  How beautiful!!!!  We drove up through beach towns and then the highlight was a drive through lava mountains covered with trees, towering over the sea.  I took pictures and if I ever figure out where and how to scan pictures and post them I shall do so.  We rented two cars and had a grand ol´ time.  The only problem that arose is that the German people, all of whom speak perfect English, talked in German to each other, effectively elimintaing the possibility that I or Annika, the Dutch girl could contribute.  They contined to do so even after I said something, Annika said something, AND Anneleise said something (even though Anneleise is German Swiss, and could understand them.)  Incredibly rude, I think, and I wont be going on any more trips with all of them together again.  In our car, luckily there was Annika, Anneleise, and Me, so we didn´t have to deal with it for anytime other than lunch and dinner.  So once we snaked our way through the mountain we ended up at a beach with sand imported from the Sahara!!!  Exciting and beautiful.  The water was also very warm and I enjoyed it very much.  Finally, we drove down through Santa Cruz de Tenerife and then into La Laguna where we had dinner and a walk through town.  La Laguna is lovely.  We retunred to Pto De la Cruz and then went our separate ways.  Annelise and I went home, then returned our rental car and then got dressed and went dancing.  We were both so tired that we only made it for an hour and half and then home to bed.  Ahh, bed.   Today I went to the grocery store, did laundry and I am not en route to the Piscina!!  Hooray for sun and umbrellas.  This is my last week in Tenerife and I have the double goals of tanning my legs (the only part of me that absolutely insists on blinding the world with its blazing whiteness) and speaking Spanish in the correct tense, instead of rushing through it and speaking always in the present tense, which is what I do now. I am also going to watch more TV so that my ears get better acustomed.  One last week...... I will miss Tenerife.

       Every day I get up at 8AM, get ready, have some breakfast, maybe drink some tea and then head down the mountain to school. My walk is very steep in places and part of it is a series of stairs that cut down at an angle to sea level.  The street down which I walk is flanked on both sides by flowering, sweet smelling trees an shrubs and the sun is either shining brightly or hiding behind fluffy white clouds.  It never hides for very long, though.   School starts at 9AM and I have two sessions of 2 hours each.  My first lesson is with Lucy.  Lucy is young and fun and is from Tenerife.  She speaks very quickly and uses her hands to make her point.  She is always enthusiastic and willing to explain thigns to us many, many times.  I have learned, though investigation, that she has a serious boyfriend who lives in Suiza and is studying French.  My second lesson is with Sergio, also young and fun but calmer than Lucy.  They provide a good balance.  Sergio is very cute and makes good faces when he is trying to explain emotions.  He has the pacience of a saint and when he is making a point, it is always sound and often insightful.   Our classes involve a combination of speaking, reading, writing and doing worksheets.  We work on verb tenses a lot and recently worked on feelings, compliments, resumes and cover letters, and we had a whole lesson on John Gray´s book ¨Men are from mars, Women are from Venus.¨  It requires a certain amount of perserverence to stay intent on figuring out what you hear for four hours and by break and lunch (break is between classes and lunch is after) I am ready for something else.  For a few days, as you know, I was busy doing scuba stuff, and then that feel apart and now i am back to creating things for myself to do.  I am usually content to go to the beach or shopping or something simple like that.  One day we went to a small town further away and looked at a tree. Tonight there are some people who are giong to a festival in another town, but they are all German and I feel a little left out when they are all togther.  There are many, many Germans at dQ.  This weekend I am going to the Teide and maybe to take a bus around the island to look at it.  Could be an adventure to take by myself. Anyway, after I go to the beach or putter around I often go home (15 minutes uphill!!!!) and take a shower and then head back down for dinner or fun.  I have also had 2 dinner parties since I´ve been here, one last week and one last night.  Very basic food- once it was spaghetti and once I had pizza.  Last night someone had stopped at the german bakery and gotten a plethora of delicious deserts.  SO GOOD.  Then, if we are down in town I usually head back by midnight and go to bed.  On the weekend maybe later, though last weekend i was very tird and didn´t do much in the late night time frame.   I love Tenerife and think it is very, very beautful. Some say its very ¨spring break¨ish but I haven´t found it to be anything but totally laid back and comfortable.  Most of the people are really nice and my only irritant is the lady who wants to braid my hair and what i create for myself!

       Today the scuba instructor came to me and gave me a bill for 100 Euros as a prorated bill for the scuba lessons.  Its listed as a try dive and registration.  I am going to talk to his boss and ask him what he thinks..... what a pain.   I am not feeling particularly well today..... I thought that I had a package in the mail and then the secretary said that I misunderstood, that she had wanted help with her English.... hand gestures in 2 languages not lining up.  The disapointment stayed with me.  Then when the scuba diver came in, it made me feel a little worse.  I talked to a friend who is also a scuba instructor, but who doesn´t teach here.... he said it was a good idea to talk to Raffa, just so he knows what happened.  If I have to pay then I will, but I feel like I should get to at least explain.  Ugh.

       Yesterday I waited for my SCUBA instructor for 2 hours.  He never came.  Then, last night when I went with some people from the school to eat and then to a bar we ran into him.  He said ¨Oh, where were you?¨  He tried to act like I should have known where he was.  But his eyes were shifty and he knew... Oh, he knew.  I have asked him every time, where will he meet, and he says ¨At the school, I´m there every day.¨  So, I decided that I didn´t want to deal with someone who stood me up AND tried to shirk it so I went to him today and told him, ¨Hey, I waited for you yesterday and you never came.  I don´t want any stress.  Its no big deal, here´s your stuff back.¨ He said somethign along the lines of ¨Your loss¨ and I said ¨I´m not worried about it.¨ and that was the end of it.   So, today I went and laid on the beach for 2 1/2 hours.  I wore sunblock of SPF 20, so I think avoided getting too much sun and burning.  It´s very necessary that I not burn since i am in the equatorial sun every day for hours at a time.  The worst thing ever is to go out in the sun when you´re already sunbrunt.  Its like frying eggs on a too hot skillet.  It quickly leads to crispy eggs and a roaring fire alarm.   I think the sun has fried my brain, so I am going to go home, take a shower, check to be sure that I indeed have not burnt, and get ready for dinner!

       Right now I should be debajo de agua but my scuba instructor never showed up!!!!  What´s that about?  I think I will not learn to do scuba with him.  I don´t think he can be trusted.  I will have to think of something else to with my time.  I might buy a mask and snorkel, though and go snorkeling soemtime.  That was really fun. Will keep you updated.  But right now I have to think about what I am going to do with the rest of my day!!!

       In my blog yesterday I mentioned Tomas the tortoise.  During my trip to Loro Parque Tomas and I became good friends.  He is a very large tortoise, something like 3 square feet and weighing quite a lot, though he refrained from providing his exact weight.  Aparently its a very personal issue for tortoises.  And, no wonder!  Poor Tom is lving all alone ,with no female companions, due to his girth!  And the worst part is, he told me that there are female tortoises in Loro Pargue but they are too young.  He says that when he is near them his passion overtakes him and he can´t control his need to be ¨with them¨ and if he tried to do that with these young lady tortoises he would crush them!  He assures me that his solitary confinement is not terminal- once the ladies get to a mature age they will be allowed to come and live with hime (he will have a harem!) but for now he is very lonely.  If ever you are in Tenerife, you should do your best to visit Tomas.  Tell him Amanda from America sent you- he´ll know who you mean.

       Ahh, Sunday.  The day of rest, phone calls, and that last minute homework.  Didn´t I say I was done with homework?  Well, it turns out that Don Quijote is a school and so they give it.  Deberes, its called.  My well laid plans, foiled again!  But its OK, because I am really enjoying learning to speak Spanish.  Its hard and frustrating and very rewarding.  Now that I am trying to learn to really, correctly speak another language I am absolutely impressed with people like Noemi and Balazs who live in the US and have an accent, but an amazing grasp of the language.   The other day I was trying to explain why a future world wouldn´t work on an incentive system (do a good job get a chanel suit) and I found that it almost wasn´t worth it.  ME, deciding that making a point was not worth the effort!  But I don´t have words like ¨economics¨ and ¨middle class¨ and ¨quality of life¨ at my disposal.  So I said ¨Tu idea esta muy interesante pero no esta perfecto.¨  ¨Your idea is very interesting but it is not perfect.¨  Brilliant observation, no?  Also, I didn´t have a dictionary and I tried all week to get to a libreria (book store) but when we are done with class its siesta, and once siesta is over I´m doing something else!!!  The siesta is very difficult to remember.  Every day for the last week I would say to someone ¨Oh, I think I will get that dictionary.  I have an hour before Scuba (or tango, or pronunciation, or the beach or whatever I had planned for the afternoon)¨  And every day when someone would say, ¨No, now is siesta¨ I would be surprised.  Every single time.  So, lets see. What have I been up to?  On Friday I had my first scuba lesson.  It was interesting, but somewhat daunting. Right when I got into the water my weight belt was on my back and it was impossible to stay straight in the water.  So we struggled with that for a while with my instructor making the very insightful comment ¨You need to stand up¨over and over again, until finally he realized that the weights would be beter on my front.  Once they were there I had more control, and that helped a lot.  Going underwater was very fun, and I was able to do one of the skills (taking the regulator out of my mouth and putting it back in).  However.  The other skill is where you let water into your mask and blow it out with air from your nose.  I let air in and then  you are supposed to look towards the surface and blow from your nose while letting the mask up a little.  Aparently I didn´t blow soon enough and my mask was filled with water and I freaked out a little.  My instructor hauled me to the surface and I told him I was done for today.  We had been at this or like 3 hours, setting up equipment, trying to get the weights in line, etc.  So, he said, very hopefully that we would be able to get through the other 6 six skills on Monday and do open water 1 on Monday as well.  I need to talk to him about how I don´t want to rush through this.  I am no extreme sports enthusiast and I need time to assimilate and understand what´s happening.  Its a cool feeling to be underwater, though. So, after my scuba lesson I went home and then Petra and I went to eat and then to meet friends for a late night drink on the beach.  We drank rum drinks out of melons!  Then home to bed.  On Saturday we went to Loro Parque (Parrot Park) and saw a dolphin show, a sea lion show, alligators, monkeys, a giant tortoise, Tom, and a Loro show.  Its a beautiful park/zoo and I will tell more about it later (only 8 min left on computer).  Then we went to see El dia de manana (the day after tomorrow, is the title in the states, I think) in Spanish and though I understood what was happening, I´n not entirely sure HOW it all happened.  When the president is in the room with the security council and talking about what to do... I was more or less lost.  Again, not having words like cold front, or security council, or whatever.  Nonetheless, it was fun to see a movie in Spanish. Then home and to bed and now its Sunday!!!

       Last night I decided to stay home and not go to a bar called Carpe Diem.  Does this sound counter-intuitive?  Sometimes I wonder what on earth people who say ¨You can sleep when you are dead¨ are going on about, and sometimes I wish I were like them.  So often, when I stay home instead of ¨seizing the day¨in the traditional way, I feel much more fulfilled than when I go out.  Not just from sleep, but from having time to think and time to feel what´s going on.  It´s hard, because there are a finite number hours in each day and there´s a fine line between experiencing too much to feel any of it, and thinking your way out of experiences.

       Class is done for today and at the end of each day we have a cultural class.  Today we learned the basic steps of tango.  I am such a bad dancer.  I need much better muscle memory and then I can combine it with my decent sense of rhythm and that would be better.  As it stands now, I get very confused.  I was the worst in the class.  ¡Que lastima! Today we are going to see an old and large tree.  I don´t know the details, but I am told that it is very large and very old, and that was enough for me to say OK.  Also, its free-  which makes it even better!   For scuba today I am supposed to read my manual and learn the first 200 pages.  Oy Vey!  But I have to do it so that I can go into the water tomoerrow!  Tomorrow is my first confined dive as well as the first time that I will breathe underwater.  I am really looking forward to it- hopefully I will be a better diver than dancer! Tomorrow is friday and my first week at Don Quijote will be done!  I can´t believe it- I don´t want time to go so quickly.  Two more weeks to become proficient and I am starting to think that this will not be enough.  Perhaps I will take lessons in Santiago de Compostela when I am there if they are not too expensive.  Anyway, I don´t have plans for the weekend yet, but I am certain that it will be much fun, especially since we don´t have to get up for class this morning.

       Today I decided to take scuba diving lessons and be extra careful with my money to compensate for this expense.  I am very, very excited about it.  My dive instructor´s name is (I think) Steve and we watched about 2 hours of introductory video today.  Tomorrow I am supposed to go through the manual and do the questions and then on Friday we get into the water.  We do three confined water dives and three open water dives.  It looked quite beautiful on the video and once I get through this course I can dive up to 18 meters anywhere in the world!!!  Very exciting! Class today was good, I am getting a better ear for spanish.  At least for understanding the spanish spoken by my teachers.  I still have trouble when I am not thinking to understand spanish when spoken unexpectedly.  But it gets better every day and since this is only the third day of 15, I have high hopes!  There is one girl in my class who, today, laughed at me because I say ¨¨si¨a lot instead of ¨Vale¨, which is ¨OK¨.  We almost had words, but luckily the other students were very defensive for me and I felt better.  She wasn´t trying to be condescending, she just thought it was funny.  I try to say Vale but when I am just trying to indicate that I understand I say ¨si, si¨ which probably is funny.  But she´s from Germany, so what does she know?     I also learned today that most of Europe doesn´t like france.  This was very interesting to me because in America (I almost said my country, but most everyone who reads this is from my country!) I think that most people assume that what we hear about France represents Europe.  Like that because the French are reputed to ¨Not like¨ America, most of Europe probably does not either.  Aparently, France is considered to be quite snobby.  This is according to a Spaniard, so maybe there is a rivalry between Spain and France in particular.  Interesting, nonetheless. Well, I woke up quite tired today and I have quite a lot of homework to do, so I am going to wrap things up on blogger, do some e'mail and then head to the mountain.

       I learned today in class that to speak profanities is to decir tacos!  How fun is that?  When I asked about it, the professor said ¨Its like fuck¨which was also very fun, because he said it like Fuuuhhc¨   Class today was much better than yesterday.  Yesterady I was completely overwhelmed and feeling like I was never going to survive.  Today, class was fun and I knew more what to expect and I enjoyed it much more.  It helped that we also covered something I was more familliar with and so I was more able to participate.   Last night, after blogging, I went to the beach and laid there for about an hour with my roommate, Petra, and a girl from Holland, Aneka.  Then the three of us went to meet another girl from Holland Ghirana and we went to eat.  We went to a pizza place and I had an artichoke ham and pineapple pizza and instead of sauce on the pizza there were like three pools of meat pasta sauce on the pizza.  Very different, but good.  Then I had desert (coffee flavored ice cream with malt balls on them) and mint tea and then the guy gave us shots of some kind of cognac which I gave to Petra, because it tasted like cough syrup.  OH! and I got trapped in the bathroom!  I was in the bathroom and shut the door, which stuck so I pulled it closed sort of hard.  Well, it wouldn´t open. So I tried the lock and the door and realized that the latch wasn´t moving when you moved the handle.  I finally got it open, but it scared me! Tonight I am having dinner with the same three girls and possibly a guy named Peter from Austria that Petra and I are cooking at our apartment.  We are making pasta and sauce with garlic bread and salad.  Then we are playing games!  Yahtzee of course!  I broght it with me from the states and this will be an international championship with champions from Germany, Holland, the US and possibly Austria.  I wish the champions of Budapest, the EU and the other US champions could come to play as well!

       Amanda asked me a couple of times what I have been eating.  I fear that my response will be boring, since my taste in food is a little boring.  Luckily I can also tell you what others have been eating and hopefully spice it up!   In London:  On my first night in London I had cheese crackers and tea.  I was too tired to eat anything more substantial as that required leaving the hostel.  But the next day I ate at the hostel for breakfast- a sad piece of bread with butter and some tea.  Then for lunch I had a sandwich from a street vendor (ham and cheese- you´ll notice a trend)  For dinner I had a proper dinner at an Indian restaurant where I had chicken masala (I wish I had you there to tell me what else to get- I am in an indian rut) and nann.  It was OK, but its better down the street at Dharma India.  :)     In Paris  On the train to Paris I had a cheese and ham sandwich and a tea.  Then, once in Paris I went to a Japonaise restaurant and had some not very good food.  Some overly sweet salad and what looked like sweet and sour chicken but was actually savory pork.  The next day in Paris I don´t remember having lunch.  I think I must have because I was starving when I left the Musee dÓrsay.  Hmmm.I hate when I can´t remember something. So I must have had something to eat because I did not have dinner that day because I was too tired to leave the hostel.  BUT the following day I had pizza from a stand and then for dinner I had Soup lógnion, a desert which had a very mile vanilla yogurt poured over pastry with apples in teh middle.  VERY GOOD.   In Barcelona  Once I got to Barcelona I went to this restaurant across the street from my hostel called Tasca y vin, and had a very salty asparagus omelet and bowl of fruit.  Not very good, truthfully.  Then I had a small ham and cheese sandwhich at the beach bar after my bike tour, and then after the pub crawl I had a pita at these pita shops they have ALL OVER Barcelona.  I had a pork pita with sauce and pickles, etc.  Very good.  Then the next day I I had a ham and cheese sandwich at the beach bar again and then for dinner I had pasta carbonara and bread and coffee and some olives.  So good.  AND RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP.  My pasta was 4 euros!!  I took lucy there the next day as well!  For lunch the next day though I had an apple and some cahsews.   Man, I really havent eaten anything great or authentic.  I think there were like 5 ham and cheese sandiwches in there.  Lets see¡ but others had Paella (rice with seafood on top) and other spanish dishes.  One person got Gazpacho.  and we had desert.  I had flan and someone else had a chocolate mouse that had so much alcohol in it that I was practually falling down drunk after one taste!  We also had Cava de casa, the specialty wine of Catalan  and sangria.  Mmm Mmmm. So, there you have it!  My food inventory!

       Hola mis amigos! I have made it safely out of Barcelona and I am in Tenerife!  I got here yestrday and waht a story that is! But first, Barcelona was very nice, though not as good as Paris or Tenerife.  I spent time on the beach and looking at Gaudi architecture.  I enjoyed it but I did not love it.  Most people, though, seem to love it, so don´t cancel your trip there on my account.  I felt like it was very touristy and I wasn´t in the mood to hang out with americans.  Anyway, I left Bacelona early yesterday morning to begin the epic journey to Tenerife.  I realized on Saturday as I was preparing my bag for the trip to Tenerife that I had not talked to the school and had no idea where I was supposed to go.  So I dug out my school stuff and looked for information.  It said to call a number and someone would come and get me from the bus station.  I tried the number at the Barcelona airport a few times and got a message saying that the mobile phone is not available now and I should call again later.  So I got on the plane and decided I would call once I was there.  Well, I called in the Tenerife airport, no answer.  I decided I would call from the bus station, so i went and got on the bus to Puerta de la Cruz. Once at the bus station I called again.  No answer.  I decided I was too hungry to work this out right now and so I had some hot dogs with onions and then called again.  No answer.  I was getting a little panicked and of course the thoughts of ¨This school doesn´t exist, I´m stranded, what´s going on, etc¨all go through my mind.  After eating my hot dog I decide that I have to figure out what´s going on and I take a cab to where the school is.  As I am approaching the school this guy on the street says that I can leave my bag with him and figure out my situation.  When I tell him that No, I will keep my bag, he proceeds to mock me.  Öh you want the exercise!  Ha ha!  You want the exercise.¨he stars to make movements like someone who is lifting weights and laughing at me.  Needless to say this didn´t improve my mood. So anyway,  The school is here (THANK GOD) but locked up tight.  Finally the mocking man tells me to go to Hotel Valle and they will tell me what to do.  So I go to the hotel and they have a key, but not for me.  So the front desk guy calls teh school and aparently calls at the right time because the mobile phone is on.  The lady says ¨Oh, tell her I will come and get her¨ and so I go to wait outside.  Turns out that she only has the phone on from 1 to 10 PM.  Good to know. So, she takes me to my flat and its very nice.  I am actually surpised at how nice it is!  I have my own room and my own bathroom and its very nice.  Also, Tenerife is absolutely beautiful.  Its very tropical and there are flowers everywhere and  beaches and palm trees.  I like it a lot though I haven´t seen much of it except on my bus ride down.  I didn´t do much exploring yesterday as I was a little frazzled by the epic arrival.   My language classes started today and its hard.  Its so over my head and I am thinking about going down a level.  They tell me to wait and see what´s happening, and so I shall try again tomorrow.  In the meantime I am exhausted and think I will go back and take a nap so that I can look around some this evening.  And if anyone knows where I can get some peanut butter in Tenerife, please let me know.  My jelly is lonely.

       It´s Friday morning and I am in Barcelona!!!  I got in yesterday from Paris on Easy Jet.  The flight was easy and I was informed at Orly airport that my president was in town.  Then I was watched very carefully for my reaction.  I said ¨Cést bon¨ and left it at that.   Once I got into Barcelona I was immediately reminded of LA.  Its beautiful pine trees and mountains in the distance and very wide boulevards.  It´s beautiful in a very laid back, calm kind of way.  After taking the bus to town, and then a cab to my hostel I dropped my bag and this girl from the hostel asked me if I wanted to go on a bike tour with her.  I agreed and off we went.  The bike tour was really fun.  We rode all around the town and the tour guide was a trip.  He was very good looking, I thought, and funny in not really trying way.  The other people on the tour were fun as well and at the end these 2 Thai guys and an american girl and me and the girl I came with decided to get together later, then when we were deciding what to do the tour guy suggested a pub crawl, so we agreed.  It was fun, though much, much too close to UDghettoing for comfort.  I had fun, but I don´t necessarily want to hang out with a bunch of american and australians on the prowl.  I want to do something with real barcelonians tonight.  But before that happens, I am going to the beach at 3!  The sun doesn´t set until 10 so people start at the beach at like 3 once its a little less hot.  I´m very much looking forward to me, a beach towel, my book and lying around.  My feet are looking forward to that as well!!  YAY!

       Since last I wrote I have a fabulous time.  After blogging I went to the counter and asked the guy if he could put in 4 weddings and a funeral.  He agreed and I sat down to watch it.  Now despite my self-proclaimed expertise on cheesy girl movies, I haven't ever seen it.  Well, I was laughing so hard at one point (when Hugh Grant is in the closet while his friends are getting it on) that the front desk guy (alvaro) came over and watched it with me.  Then, while the movie was still on, his friend (nicolas) came to visit him and sat down to watch it too.  After the movie was over Nicolas pulled out a bottle of wine and asked me if I wanted some.  I said yes, and we began to talk.  We talked for 4 hours.  Alvaro, Nicolas and I talked about politics, France, America, France and America, and how we should all just get along.  Finally, at 1AM I had to go to bed and Nicolas had to go home.  I think it was about time for Alvaro to close up for the night as well.  I enjoyed our conversation very much. Then this mornng, I woke up late and went down to the kitchen to beg a baguette from the breakfast guy.  He gave me one but wouldn't get out the butter and jelly.  Beggars can't be choosers, so I thanked him sweetly and took my bread upstairs to get ready.  It took me until 11:30 to leave the hostel.  Once I did, though I was set.  I went down to St. Germain des Pres where I was suppoed to meet my French Revolution Walking tour at 2:30.  I WAS NOT going to risk missing it like I missed Jack the Ripper.  Since I didn't have dinner last night, except for the wine and the baguette didn't do much to satiate me, I was starving. So I went to a counter and got a tea and a slice of piza (cheese and tomato).  I wrote a letter to Ms. Jennifer Slutz to include in a package of post cards I sent her (It was going to cost me 1 euro per card to send them from here so I chose my faithful friend to send them from the states.  Not everybody gets one yet, but quite a few people.  Don't despair, though, if you aren't in the first batch, I am saving some people for Barcelona cards.) and then sat and waited for my tour to begin.  I was fearful that the guide wasn't going to come due to my luck with JtheR but I was merely paranoid, he was right on time.  His name was Brad and he hails from California.  He didn't have much presence but he told soem dry jokes that I appreciated and so all was well.  The tour itself was interesting.  I didn't know anything about the French Revolution and now I know a little.  The "tour" though was better suited for a lecture than tour, though.  We saw some pubs that they had meetings in, a monastary that they meetings in, and some houses where people lived or died.  One guy got killed ina  bathtub by a woman with a kitchen knife from the other side.  He was in the bathtub because he had a skin disorder and took all his meetings there.  Interestingly, at the time there were 300,000 people in paris and only 50 bathtubs.  Anyway, the tour was interesting but we didn't "see" much.  We ended the tour over by Notre Dame where Napoleon crowned himself and Josephine Emporer and Empresss.  OH, and the tour guy said that there was a woman who is credited with predicting the entire revolution in detail, years before anyone could have guessed.  Cool. So, the tour ended and I took what was most certainly the LONG way back.  It took me forever, and I knew the entire time that I was in the neighborhood, but I was too pigheaded to take out the map.  I eventually got there, went to stationary store and bought a cool red envelope to send Jen her letter.  I went to the Movie theater and bought a ticket for the 7PM Harry Potter and then went to La Poste to send my package.  One of the postcards wouldn't fit in the red envolope so I sent that one from France as well.  Then I ate the apple I had bought earlier from the fruit stand (Like in Amelie!) and waited for my movie to start.  By the time I had finished my apple and took notice, the line for people with tickets to HP was around the corner.  So, I hurried over to it and waited for maybe 20 minutes.  The line moved quickly and before I knew it I was inside and seated for Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban, version originale!  While we waited for the movie to start I chatted with the nice french girls next to me.   OH!  One of them was seen outside the theater!  She was crossing the street and almost got hit by a car.  She screamed and ran after the car and hit it with her purse!  The guy got out of his car and came to talk to her, and he got the international symbol for "talk to the hand, cause this aint hearin it!" and he went back to his car shamefaced.  It was cool.  I mean, it was scary when she almost got hit, but good for her for hitting the car.  I can never do things like that.  Anyway, she sat next to me and offered me M&Ms and I gave her some of my toblerone.  The movie was great.  I honestly think that it is the best, by far, of the three movies by far.  I think I like the new director better.  It was also, curiously, the least true to the book.  But it made it interesting.   After the movie I was hungry again and decided to go and actually eat in a cafe!  I had un cafe Creme (which I ordered regular but got GRAN, curses!) soup l'ognion and then had desert.  The waiter was cool to me at first, he could tell I was american and didn't speak french, but I kept trying to speak French, and he eventually complimented me "Tres bien Francias!!" I laughed delightedly and was so, so excited.  I was excited enough to give him a big tip.  he said "Merci Beaucoup an I said "Pas de Probleme" which eh didn't undestand, so i said "you're welcome" and he said "Au revoir" and shook my hand.  I practically skipped out of the restaurant!   I love it here.  I love being new and curious and how even speaking and ordering coffee is an adventure.  So much to know, so much to discover, its like being little and being introduced to something wonderful- like peanut butter!  The possibility for new friends, and a whole new kind of friendship.  The triumph of communicating your simple desires to someone who you could not have known, could not have connected with otherwise.  Paris c'est tres, tres magnifigue.  And its only the beginning.

       I saw a few very stange things today.   1) Catedral De Notre Dame is set up like a common souvenier shop!  2 Euros to light a candle, 3 Euros for a Notre Dame pin, collection tins all around and propaganda about supporting the living history of Notre Dame on tables throughout the church.  Its beautiful, but it would be more beautiful if it were a CHURCH.  It freaked me out a little.  Notre Dame is only a small step away from the Buddy Jesus of Dogma. 2) I saw a red-headed (feathered) pidgeon today.  I thought, "Oh, he's pretty!" and I traditionally hate pidgeons.  This just might be my kind of town. 3) Contrary to the Bourne Identity, there is no outdoor viewing area to check whether the bad guy "came alone" at the Samaritaine Dept Store.  I asked the lady at the 9th floor souvenier stand about it and she said they closed it a year ago.  Too bad, I was excited about it!  There is a bar/cafe up there that you can pay 3Euros and get a coffe and enjoy the view.  I am considering doing that tomorrow.  Today it rained all day long so i didn't think it was worth it. 4) One of the strangest things I have experienced so far is that whiney children are annoying in any language. You would think that someone saying "Mom, I wanna..." would be less irritating if you didn't speak their language.  Not so.  5) French people love to tell you that they are going, have gone, or hope to go to America.  This surprised me.  Many people want to talk about New York, and I now can say "C'est ville tres gran" (its a very large city) in response to "Je'tem New York" (I like New York) and one guy told me all about how is going to Key West for 15 days and did I think he'd like it.  I told him to get a henna tattoo.  :) All in all, I had a really nice day today.  I went to the Musee d'Orsay (Impressionisme), walked to Notre Dame, then to Samaritain and, then to the Louvre metro (which looked open today, despite every tour books claim to the tuesday closure.... curious) to Champs Elyses and walked around there.  Finally, my feet were like GET ME OFF THIS STREET! and so I came back to the hostel.  Now I am checking e-mail and thinking about taking a little nap and maybe going out once its dark to see the city at night.  Last night I went to see the Eifel Tower lit up- its sparkles every hour on the hour and I got to see that... which was way cool!   I am hoping that tomorrow will be warmer and not raining so I can do my French revolution walking tour and the Centre Pompidou!

       Hola! Its hotter than Dante´s deepest circle of hell here in Granada.  I saw a thermometer and it´s 36ºC (96.8ºF) with blazing sun..... its the sun that does you in.  When I am standing completely still in the shade, its not unbearable.  :) Joshua and I left Santiago de Compostela at 9:45AM yesterday and drove to Madrid.  While walking to the car rental place, which by the way is ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE, I gave up the idea of the duffel bag.  Its just too heavy.  So I decided right then, and made Joshua promise not to let me change my mind, to take the red suitcase on wheels.  So, after that epic decision was made we piled all our belongings into a diesel Citreon and went merrily on our way to Salamanca.  We had a great ride to Salamanca, singing songs and trying to discern what Sarah McLaughlin was saying in one of her new songs... we listened to it about 15 times.  We made it to Salamanca, right on time, at 3:30 to meet Ludwing´s sister who had agreed to take us on a tour.  We ate Kebobs and then walked all around Salmanca....which, by the way, is also hotter than boiling water.  Salamanca is quite a lot like Santiago and so while it was beautiful I wasn´t overcome.  After a hot walk from about 4:30 to 7:30 we piled back into the car to drive to Madrid.  We had your basic two-people-never-been-to-massive-city-and-need-to-find-hostel-in-suburbs trouble finding the hostel... we had to call the hostel a few times for directions and arrived quite late.  Joshua, I think, was done like a popped turkey by the time we go there.  I felt bad, because I only drove a little bit of the way because he is infinitly better at driving a standard then I am.  Anyway, we made it, got our requisite 4 hours of sleep and we up this AM at 5 to head to the airport.  I dropped Joshua off at the enormous BAirways line and headed into Madrid to find the Renfe station.  And you know what?  The red bag is really not that bad.  When I have to I can pick it up and lug it up stairs.... and hey, who doesn´t need to work on her arm muscles?  Anyway, I made it to the station, waited in 15 lines, activated my Eurail pass and hopped on the train.  The train ride was about 6 hours and the most eventful part was when the old lady in front of me and I  had silent and furious negotations about how low the window shade should be.  She won.... I can´t argue with the elderly, I think my Grandparents would be too disapointed.  I was sort of tired, but I couldn´t fall asleep for awhile.  I finally took a nourishing nap once we entered Andalusia, which is STUNNING.  It was a fun experience because I kept waking up and peering out the window (with the shade UP, thank you very much, she  finally  left) and being delighted and thinking ¨beautiful¨ before I slipped back into sleep.  And so,  Joshua is about 2 hours from Boston, right now...... and I am in Granada.  So far, Granada looks really, really nice.  Hot, but nice.  Can you tell I´m hot?  OK, so I am going to take my hot (in more ways then one, if you know what I mean.. heh heh.... hm) self out into the cruel Moorish world.  My big plans are to go to the tourist office (officina de Tourismo), then come back and stake out my plans for the next two days... three including today..... do you count today when you are saying how many days of something are left?  I am always unsure about that..... whatever- I leave on Tuesday on a HotelTren from Granada to Barcelona.  Will write tomorrow, for sure because my hotty-hot-hot self is going to the Alhambra and I intend to be AMAZED. Hasta Luego!

       So last night Joshua and I had a bit of an adventure!&nbsp; We went to Pontevedra and met Marian, our clown professor, who was in a Festival de Clown in a nearby Pueblo.&nbsp; We did in fact meet her and attend her performance without incident.&nbsp; The performance was really fun- they did a clown adaptation of Cinderella, with references to the prince of Spain.&nbsp; Then we had a quick dinner and went to Marian´s house where we were all set to stay.&nbsp; She made up the beds and we were just about asleep when Joshua started wheezing!&nbsp; She has a cat, see, and he´s allergic, but he didn´t think that he would have a reaction.. but he did, he had a really bad one.&nbsp; He couldn´t breath and so we work up Marian and had a big pow wow about what should be done.&nbsp; Joshua kept saying that he would sleep outside, but the cat lived outside on the terrace and then they were all set to get a sleeping bag but remembered that the cat could have been in the sleeping bag... Meanwhile Joshua is pretending to be fine while his lungs are getting 25% of its normal air capacity (he tells me later).&nbsp; Marian is offering to take us back to Santiago de Compostela by car, which I am saying is for the best, and meanwhile Joshua is still trying to be a hero ¨No, I´m fine, fine, fine¨ and finally he´s like.... ¨OK, yeah, I really need my inhaler.¨&nbsp; So, Marian and her boyfriend and Joshua and I pile into the car at 3AM and head to Santiago de Compostela.&nbsp; Joshua felt terrible, Marian felt bad because she wanted him to feel better, because she didn´t care, she just wanted him to breathe normally again, and her boyfriend and I just shut up and let them figure it out.&nbsp; But it all worked out in the end and this morning we packed and cleaned Joshua´s room and now I am going home to pack and clean my room and then tonight we are meeting at 9:30 for a little going away dinner and then a free concert... one of the last vestiges of the Festival of Sant Iago!!!&nbsp; AND TOMORROW- off to Granada via Salamanca and Madrid!!

       So Monday I come home to find not one, but two packages waiting for me!!!&nbsp; Monica´s package included PEANUT BUTTER, a travel journal and a cheese-riffic girl book.&nbsp; I promised myself that I wasn´t going to raed the cheesey girl book until I was on the train to Granada....... but then, see, it had all these inserts that are from a fictional cosmo style magazine so I was looking through those... no harm in that, right?&nbsp; Well, then I read a line and&nbsp;it was intriguing, and I didn´t want to read out of order so I just sort-of started the book... and before I knew it, much to my chagrin, I am halfway through it.&nbsp; It´s quite good..... It´s called ¨How to meet cute boys¨ Lord have mercy.&nbsp; How well do my friends know me?&nbsp;  THEN, Jen´s package included&nbsp;a 3A Mix that has already offered me hours of entertainment.&nbsp; In fact, I am listening to it right now!&nbsp; I brought it to the computer lab because Jen sent an email with what each song means.&nbsp; Just a teaser......... it starts with the MUPPET SHOW THEME SONG:&nbsp; The most sensational, inpirational, celebrational, muppetational.... SHOW!&nbsp; It only gets better.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can´tell you anymore for fear a 3A girl will read this prior to getting her CD.&nbsp; The surprises abound.&nbsp; Let me just say, though, for the RECORD, my name is not Mandy.&nbsp; But thinking of Mark  is  always&nbsp;a good thing, so I forgive Jen for this one transgression.&nbsp; Me gusta mucho la CD&nbsp;. The packges came just in time, because I am getting things ready to roll outta town.&nbsp; And I was just about to run out and get a new travel journal since my old one is so worn out that the cover fell off.&nbsp; Hee hee.&nbsp; So, now I have new one and can send the other one home with Joshua!&nbsp; Speaking of the suitcase/duffel bag dilemna..... SO, the world UNANIMOUSLY support the duffel bag.&nbsp; So, today I am going to go home and try really, really hard to cut out all the crap I don´t need and go with the duffel bag.&nbsp; Even my Aunt Theresa agrees, and I pegged her for a rolling suitcase kind of girl.&nbsp;  Tonight Joshua and I are going to a small beautiful town called Pontevedra to see a clown festival that our clown teacher is in.&nbsp; She is letting us stay at her house, which will be fun, and then tomorrow I have to finish packing and then Joshua, his new beau,&nbsp; his roommate who I like a lot, hopefully his roommate who I love, and I are going out to eat traditional Gallego food.&nbsp; I´m hoping for a night without cow womb (A traditional delicacy).&nbsp; Please God, spare me from cooked cow womb.&nbsp;  Last night I got my hair cut in&nbsp; cross between an American and European style.&nbsp; He wanted to really Euro it out, but I was able to temper it some.&nbsp; I really like it!! I think I will send Lisa, my hairdresser extraordinaire in Boston,&nbsp;a picture so she can see me with European hair.&nbsp; Maybe I look like a European soccer Mom, there´s no telling since I don´t know how they look.&nbsp; Maybe like me?&nbsp; Of course they would call themselves a Futbol Madre.&nbsp; I also bought a fabuous suit from my new favorite store, ZARA, yesterday for roughtly 100 Euros.&nbsp; It is in the suitcase bound for Boston... so Char Ann, or Lisa who ever ends up with it, will you please hang it up and admire my good taste?&nbsp; If Sesame Street doesn´t want me when I´m wearing this suit with EuroFutbolMadre hair, they are crazy!&nbsp; Right? Golly.&nbsp; I guess I better go pack!&nbsp; OH!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; GUESS WHAT?&nbsp; Monica wrote me an email today indicating that she MIGHT COME VISIT IN AUGUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I will be in Paris when she MIGHT come.&nbsp; HOW INCREDIBLY FUN would it be to be in Paris with Monica!?!?!??!&nbsp; SO FUN.&nbsp; I have to keep chanting MIGHT MIGHT MIGHT in my head.&nbsp; I am hoping she will read this and feel pressure to get a ticket and come!&nbsp; Do you feel pressure Monnie?&nbsp; Do ya? Huh, huh?&nbsp;  I´m off to pack!! I will try to write something tomorrow before I leave but if not then I will write from GRANADA!!&nbsp; Maybe I wil have already basked in the beauty of the Alhambra before I write again!&nbsp; I am buying my ticket for Sunday today (You can buy them at bank branches!)!&nbsp; Hooray!

       So, the last week has been a little crazy.&nbsp; I have been bored, had a cold, and was&nbsp;ready to leave Santiago.&nbsp; I wanted to let a little of that crankiness&nbsp;blow over before I blogged.&nbsp; Events of interest over the last 5 days are:&nbsp;  I went to see Joshua´s clown final on Friday.&nbsp; He was a fabulous/scary she-rah style superhero in a flaming red wig.&nbsp; Good stuff!&nbsp;  Joshua and I went to the beach again at Castrol de Baroña.&nbsp; So beautiful.&nbsp; Its the same beach we went to before with the 4th century Celtic remains.&nbsp; We actually camped there on Saturday night.&nbsp; On Sunday I was sunsick, but the rest was good! I have made quite a lot of hostel reservations for Granada, Barcelona, Prague and Paris.&nbsp; I am going to stop making reservations now, though because I want to wait and see where exactly I want to go!&nbsp;  That´s it!&nbsp; Not much doing, here in Santiago since I felt sick a lot and took lots of naps.&nbsp; I am really looking forward to this week and then on with the travelling. I´m especially excited about being in Prague, seeing the Boston Girls,&nbsp;seeing Petra,&nbsp;seeing&nbsp;Anneliese and&nbsp; I am treating myself to 3 more days in Paris, which is&nbsp;my favorite place in the world so far!&nbsp; Also, by a stroke of exciting luck Anneliese is joining me for a week in Ireland which will be a whirlwind of Celtic fun if I have anything to say about it!

       So last night I went to see Sara Baras dance flamenco.&nbsp; I had seen people dance flamenco in movies, but it didn´t really prepare me for the intensity of seeing it in person.&nbsp; It´s an interesting cross between tap dancing and salsa dancing.&nbsp; I would be watching her dance in that haze one gets when watching tap dancing... where the only thought you have is ¨No one´s feet should move that quickly¨, and then suddenly she´d be whirling her dress around and her hands would swirl in invitation and I´d jerk awake and realize how much more is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was like a dream..... which is the name of the show- Sueños.&nbsp; There was a guy who danced with her sometimes who had this impossibly long, straight beautiful hair.&nbsp; Man, did he know how to use it!&nbsp; He would whip around and his hair would follow and then stop as abruptly as he did. That´s the other thing about flamenco... if you aren´t paying attention it could look like nothing is going on, because there is a frenzy of action and then STOP and all you see is a hand in the air lazily spinning.&nbsp; To stop that quickly and be able to look relaxed as though you are inviting someone in for lemonade on a hot, muggy August day in Georgia..... is&nbsp;amazing.  Today I walked up to the convent that one can see from the Pretty bar (Momou).&nbsp; I wandered around and saw lots of pilgrims with their tell- tale backpacks and sleeping mats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I came here enroute to the&nbsp;art museum.&nbsp; Its the&nbsp;same&nbsp;one I went to before&nbsp;but&nbsp;we didn´t get to finish it and there is a painting I want to see again. I am also interested in seeing the leaf room again.&nbsp; Tonight I think I am going to the&nbsp;Negro Espiritual Concierto: con las Fisk Jubilee Singers!&nbsp; For Free! &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Hola.&nbsp; So, the weekend came and went and now its Tuesday.&nbsp; This week is the festival of Santiago (Saint James) and the city is alive with touristas.&nbsp; I got a schedule of events and am excited to report that there are a lot of free musical/dance concerts.&nbsp; I intend to attend them.&nbsp; For example, this evening I am going to the Bonaval park to see a gospel choir!&nbsp;  Sadly, we did not make it to the beach this weekend.&nbsp; Joshua has a cold (AGRIPPA!) and now I do too.... we didn´t go on Saturday because Joshua was feeling badly and then Sunday it was cloudy.&nbsp; Instead we went to Pontevedra, a town about an hour away.&nbsp; We walked around and had a bit of an adventure as we got lost on our way back from town to the bus station..... and we missed the last bus back!!!!&nbsp; So we took a train instead, but it was harrowing as we weren´t sure that a train would run and thought perhaps we would be stuck in Pontevedra!!!&nbsp; That would have sucked. Today I went to the Catedral de Santiago... que BONITA.&nbsp; It´s quite nice and very large.&nbsp; I am hoping to be able to sit down for mass sometime this week, and maybe go to confession.&nbsp; They have the walls lined with confession stalls and priests inside to give it.&nbsp; One priest was srtaight up asleep in his stall.... I almost woke him up, but figured, it´s the festival, he´s probably tired. I spent&nbsp;3 hours or more yesterday in the computer lab working on my trip and feel good about how its turning out.&nbsp; I am going to (by the end) visit 21 cities in 8 countries!&nbsp; Fun! Now I am&nbsp;off to meet Joshua at 2:30 for lunch!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Today was the last day of my clown course!&nbsp; Que Lastima..... but, I enjoyed it so much that I really have to enjoy every part of it..... even the ending.&nbsp; I have a certificate that I will frame and hang on my wall.&nbsp; Today we had an exercise involving mimicking other people in the class.... the person who imitated me indicated that I fidget a lot in my seat&nbsp;and speak with my hands and roll my eyes all the time.&nbsp; Who knew! This weekend, Joshua and I are going to beach for real!&nbsp; If you remember we were going to go last weekend but in the end it was too rainy.&nbsp; We had a very nice week, weather-wise&nbsp;and I have high hopes that the weekend will be the same! Hurrah!&nbsp;  Tonight we are going to eat chineese food and then&nbsp;to the pretty bar again.&nbsp; I am looking forward to it! Plans are coming together for the last 2 months of travel, with some problems arrising&nbsp;inevitably from the planning process of the Boston Takes Europe 2004.&nbsp; This is what happens when 4 people are trying to do&nbsp;plan a 10 day trip, each with different objectives.&nbsp; I am hoping that it will&nbsp;get sorted out soon. This is everything going on in my life right now..... I am not&nbsp;feeling philosophic right now, though suffice it&nbsp;to say that I have been practically drowning in my own thoughts the last 2 days.&nbsp; Last night I&nbsp;was up until&nbsp;2AM trying to follow a softer&nbsp;side of me&nbsp;through the&nbsp;songs I love.&nbsp;&nbsp;Words like bitter, grace, undertow, ravage, and rage have&nbsp;resonated with me for so long; &nbsp;its interesting to feel words like hold, heal, calling, &nbsp;home, and solid resonate almost as&nbsp;much. Happy weekending, Girl Powerers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Yesterday I felt like a release, an understanding of how I want to live and today, things were really nice..... I am trying to live it, not to think it, if you know what I mean.  I am feeling today like if I let go and live, then the rest will come.  Today´s analogy involves walking down a city street..... a really busy city street full of pedestrians having their own thought and their own feeling and their own preoccupations.  One possibility is to stop every time someone is in your way and think your way through it and another way is to keep walking, assuming that with an open mind the way through the pedestrians will open for you.  Keeping your eyes open and being willing to go where the path leads.  You will come to your destination unscathed and with a minimum of frustration.   This goes hand in hand with my clown course.... a clown is a person who is completely available and believes himself completely capable.  When a clown speaks in another language, he speaks with complete certainty, he juggles with complete confidence, he performs like a confident child at the Easter Pageant... even if he doesn´t know the language, can´t juggle and forgot his lines.  And think........ remember when you were learning to type.... its so hard when you are trying to think about where the keys are.... but when you stop and JUST TYPE, its easy, it works out, the kinks work out, the typing becomes fast and sure....  at least, that´s how I learned to type.   There is something about naturalness....... I am not sure exactly what it is, or how it goes, but its there.... I can feel it.  Perhaps its divinity, perhaps its energy, perhaps its just falling into step with the rhythms of the earth.  I don´t know, but I´ll keep thinking about it.

       Joshua, my good friend here in Santiago, came to Santiago de Compostela without a friend, having never been here, and in so doing, found direction.  I am not talking about the ¨This is fun, I should travel more often.¨  NO.  I am talking about the realization of a preferred artform, the drive to be an artist, and the means through which to work on his artform.  I am not kidding! The all-powerful ¨they¨ say that in order to find something completely new, it´s neccesary to rid yourself of what´s old.... and its up to you how new you want to be at a given time.  The more you hold onto, the less that can come to you.  If one wants to, he or she can be new everyday... and perhaps, insodoing, touch truth.  But, that´s more philosophical than I want to be today.  I want to take it all a step lower and talk about me: my life, my newness, my awarenes, my ability to ground myself  in myself .   I have been having an experience... ever since I decided to take this trip (though I had a taste of it before); it´s a sense of ¨meant to be.¨  The things that are happening are happening without a lot of finagling.  It feels like this.... I am siting in front of a peg board that I have decided to fill and I notice a hole, shaped like a star.  No sooner than when I notice it, does a peg shaped like a star appear.  The only trouble I have is when I sit around thinking... ¨Oh my God, what am I going to do if a rainbow shaped hole shows up... how will I handle it?¨ Because if and when a rainbow shaped hole shows up, sure enough, there´s a rainbow shaped peg.  Without fail.... I am telling you, it´s weird. It feels like I could live like this, if only I were able to  follow  this feeling.  I really want to.  I really want to be able to follow this feeling. In Shim sung we realized that if you give 100% of what you have then you will receive 100% and be full.  Breath... right now... breath all the air out of your body and then breath in... do you see how much fuller you feel, now that you have rid yourself of what was already there?  Its the same volume of air, but its all new.  Maybe....just maybe, life can be the same.

       Bienvenidos a Girl Power!  I have news!   Joshua and I are taking a clown course, in SPANISH!  Of course, this is nothing new for Joshua since he takes courses in Spanish all the time (in fact, this course is at his school) but for me its terribly interesting!  I miss a lot, but I am can get by, which is fun.  Today was our second day and we got our red noses today.  We used them in class, along with funny hats and wigs.  It was incredibly fun... I sang The Ants go Marching One by One, hurrah, hurrah! while sitting on my balloon, which wouldn´t pop.  Tee hee! In other news, the past weekend was very, very fun... though too rainy on Saturday to go to the beach (we are going this weekend instead).  Joshua and I had lots of fun.  On Saturday night we went to eat Chineese food and then went to a club that played fun music and then to the most beautiful bar in Santiago.... it had an enormous terrace that opened out onto the landscape overlooking a monastary.  Then on Sunday we went hiking up into a nearby mountain... we were there for about 5 hours I got some sun, despite not going to the beach!  We had pizza for dinner and then Joshua went home and I went to bed!  Then, of course the clown course began and here we are- back where we started!

       Hola de Galicia, terra de lluvia. It´s raining again in Galicia... I fear for our beach plans!  We checked El Tiempo on Yahoo for Santiago de Compostela and it indicates rain again for tomorrow.  ¡Que Lastima! Joshua (who is right beside me at another computer- he says hi!) says that we can decide tomorrow if we want to go and camp and if not then we can go on Sunday, when Yahoo indicates that we will have sun.  I was looking forward to camping on the beach, but lluvia and camping do not mix very well. Last night we watched Monster, with Charlize Theron as a serial killer.  It was a great performance, but not a great movie.  Disturbing for sure, but not as good as the world told me is would be.   I had another meeting with the orthodontist last night and we talked about prefixes and suffixes.  It rained all day long.   There were more chocolate cookies consumed last night during Monster.... and the newest invention is to dip them in hot chocolate.  So good... so, so good. All is well in Galicia, but due to the rain not much ¨doing¨ has occurred.  I think that we are going back to see the rest of the art museum today and then who knows.  Joshua has a date tonight (with the fun, cute interior designer) and I haven´t decided how I will entertain myself yet.  Perhaps I will write letters or go see a movie (though, honestly, I have seen them all) or maybe I will read a book in a restaurant (Owen!), though Spain is not so agreeable for this as is USA.... I get funny looks.   Anyway, regardless of the actual activity I will be entertained and another night will pass enjoyably.  Enjoy your weekend, and I will return to blogworld on Monday!

       It´s raining in Galicia today.  There are times when the sun shines and times when the rain comes down so hard that it is difficult to see through it.  People struggle into, and out of sweaters, sweatshirts and light coats, as the rain comes and goes.   Last night I went to see Shrek 2 for the third time, the second time in Spanish. I went with Joshua and his new beau, Sergio.  Sergio is cute and nice and Joshua seems to like him, which is what matters.  They are going out again tomorrow night, to an alternative theater thing.  He (Sergio) is an interior designer.   Today, Joshua and I met and had lunch and went to a modern art museum in his neighborhood.  There was a room filled with leaves- literally the walls were made of leaf hoding wire baskets and it smelled heavely.  In this same room, there was a photograph of a tree, hung upside down.  I am now on the lookout for a tree that I can take a picture of, to hang upside down.  We didn´t make it through the whole thing because Joshua had a lesson soon and we hadn´t eaten yet.  We are going to go again, soon. As is my custom on rainy days, I am now headed to my home to crawl into the bed, open the window and gaze listlessly into the gray expanse of sky visible from the confines of my blanket and pillow, until my consciousness fades and I am asleep.

       Hola de España!  The last couple of days I have been a little loopy.  I mean that I have been a little bit discontent, a little uncertain, a little ungrounded.  The weather has been responding appropriately; alternatly cold, rainy, sunny, warm.  I have been spending time in the bed and eating ice cream and chocolate sandwich cookies.... mmm.  I could go for a chocolate sandwhich cookie right now.   Currently I am in the computer cafe that I like, with the nice front desk lady- Eva.  They play 80s music (Los Ochentas, as they are called here) and currently I am regalled with a song involving a series of ¨Don´t let me  go! No, no no no no.¨ I can´t think of the title and I am  too lazy to get up and ask Eva if she knows.  I am not too lazy, however to sing out loud to the music as though I am alone.  I am drinking a soda called KAS, which is an almost unsweetened lemonaid.  Its a bit jarring, you open it expecting Sprite, and you get a very tart carbonated lemmon drink.  Its really good, though, and it has grown on me.   Yesterday I had my first official English lesson with the Orthodontist. We discussed the difference between significant and important.  It´s hard to explain things like that! Today Joshua and I went shopping and bought stuff for our salad lunch and some chocolate sandwich cookies to replace the ones we ravaged yesterday.  They were his roommate´s and we ate the  whole bag.  This happened when Sergio (Joshua´s roommate, the owner of the cookies) and I were playing Yoshi´s World video games.  We kicked butt while we ate cookies.   I am currently reading a book called ¨A Prayer for Owen Meany.¨  Owen is my new favorite fictional person.  Anyone who has not already, should run immediately to Barnes and Noble (what are you still doing here?) and buy it.  It´s by our good friend John  Irving (Cider House Rules) and so well written you forget its a book and not a conversation with new friends.  Stephen King likes it too, he told me so- on the cover of the book.  In other news, I recently purchased a Eurail pass and planned the  Month of August .  I am visitng with the girls from Boston from August 5-12 and we are going to Prague and visiting Budapest and Vienna... though this still needs to be sorted out entirely.  I am hoping that Noemi will be able to visit with me a little in  Barcelona in that first week in August.  I miss her!  (to Noemi: I miss you!)  After the reunion entitled BOSTON TAKES EUROPE, 2004 I am travelling to Heidelberg to visit my good friend Petra!  Following this is my trip to Zurich to visit Anneleise.  Then comes the currently undetermined itinerary of the ¨small town France tour.¨  As I have told you all, I plan to spend a good part of September in Ireland and then a quick flight to London and then life in the US will consume me once again.  Start praying now for me, that the consuming life involves Sesame Street (Aka Barrio Sesame, Plaza Sesame). This weekend Joshua and I are camping on the beaches of Spain.  Its really beautiful there and the camping is free.  We are going to take food with us... and of course chocolate sandwich cookies.

       Freedom is a funny, binding thing.  As you all know, perhaps better than I, this past weekend the Fourth of July was celebrated in the US.  A few people here wanted to know what it was, and I attempted to describe it.  They asked if it was the biggest party of the year, and I said no, that was New Years.  ¨Not Thanksgiving?¨ they asked.  No, I said, that´s about families.   Freedom in the US is about roaming, its about the right to be critical,  the right to be unclear, the right to be rich, the right to be powerful and the right to be American.  Proud to be an American.  Proud and insistent that I will be these things that being an American is.  Proud to roam and be rich and powerful and unclear and critical.  Let me say that I am the person that patriotism is designed for.  I cry when I hear Proud to be an American and I love the idea of my country.  I know that there is much to criticize, but this is not a defining characteristic of the US, its a defining characteristic of civilation as we know it.   But American freedom has a powerfully persuasive sense of urgency to it.  The ¨american dream¨ is to rise above whatever is placed above us and to become in our own right powerful, rich, and knowledgeably critical.  The rich and powerful part is the carrot at the end of the stick, the award for being properly american, which we are all, of course, proud to be.  The hyper-focus on being a proud, upright, american contributes to the resulting lack of clarity.  With eyes on THE prize we forget to stop long enough to decide if that is exactly the prize we want.  Do we want to be rich and powerful at the loss of health and well being?  Do we want to be knowledgeably critical at the loss of our ability to conenct to the pain of others? The American spirit is a powerful thing.  If we were able to focus that intense desire to pursue something on more than one goal, I believe we could be a country worhty of even greater pride.  I love my country and I hope that the freedom we celebrate will one day be the freedom to decide what kind of American we want to be.  Do you want to be the American who pursues capital?  Do you want to be the kind of American who pursues human rights?  Do you want to be the kind of American who pursues pleasure?  Do we want to be the kind of American who pursues understanding of the relative worth of all opinions?  With options only can America be the kind of country it seeks to be.

       Today I moved into the apartment I will be in for July.  I am living in the apartment of a friend of Joshua´s who is returning to the States.  She not only handed on her apartment but also her phone!  So, now I have a phone number that works in Spain!  It´s listed on the right hand of this page.  Call me! The last couple of days have been pretty low key.  Yesterday I went to Joshua´s second of three finals and enjoyed his performance.  Afterwards, Lesley and some of her friends went out to dinner for her going away party.  It was nice and after a couple of drinks my Spanish improved immensely!  I am going to suggest this as a possible tactic for the Don Quijote school of language education.  Joshua joined us when he was done with school and we were out until about 3:30 AM.  This morning we got up late and then drug my enormous bag to Lesley´s apt.  Then four of us went to eat Chineese food and then Lesley left for the airport and I sort of unpacked. Now I am checking e'mail and blogging for a bit before I go to Joshua´s third and final exam!  Then we are going to go out with people from his school, though I don´t know how long i will last.  Tomorrow we are going to the beach, which should be fun!

       Yesterday, I didn´t make it to the science museum, but I did make it to the caves that people live in.  I didn´t get to go in, though, which is too bad.  We walked up the mountain and looked at the Abbey and were back down in half an hour... this after 3 hours of missing busses (to the science museum), trying to take the wrong bus (to the caves) and waiting for a very particular bus for way too long (the actual bus to the cave).  After all that effort we were so hungry that we got food and then wandered the Arab District some more.  I bought a scarf for €2 and then went home to pack and get ready for the night train to Barcelona..... At least, that´s what I thought I was getting ready for!  When we got to the train station (by we I mean the 4 Canadian girls and me, who happened to be on the same train) we were informed that the train was not coming, it was broken down somewhere between Barcelona and Grenada, aparently en route to Grenada.  So, they said, you are going to take a bus to Barcelona!  NOW:  I had payed for a SLEEPER... a bed, with linnen, and privacy, leg room and access to both of my bags.  But alas!  I couldn´t wait until today to take the train because I leave for Hungary early tomorrow morning and so I quickly repacked my bags and climbed aboard.  Suffice it to say I didn´t sleep very well (actually, at all) and I am cranky.  But the good news is, I got almost my entire ticket price back AND they didn´t mark a day off on my Eurail Pass!   To add insult to injury its a cloudy, crappy day in Barcelona!  I can´t even go collapse on the beach!!  So I spent too much money on lunch, bought a book and I am going to go lay on my hostel bed.... which is in a room sharing with a gaggle of 19 year old boys from Holland who are here celebrating graduating from high school and who informed me that they plan to be the last back to the hostel and the last ones up in the AM for their 9 day stay.  I am pleased to report that we will be sharing a room for one night only, and indeed I have to be up and out by 7AM tomorrow limiting the exposure. Tomorrow AM I leave for Budapest on a Air Berlin flight through Duseldorf.  I am really, really looking forward to seeing Noemi and Katy and Amanda while exploring Budapest.  Its going to be fun to be with people I already know!  Hooray!

       I am having a fabulous time in Granada!  Yesterday I went to the Catedral and to the Chapel.  The Catedral was built by the Catholic Monarchs (Isabel!) on the spot of the most important mosque as a sign of dominance and chock full of beautiful alterpieces in a myriad of styles.  All but a few of them were gorgeous enough to the be the main alter piece in any self respecting church.  The Catedral was huge and white and outstanding... breathtaking.  I liked it a lot.  We did an audiotour and I was the audiotourguide, as I was in the Alhambra.  Good times.  Then we went to the chapel, connected to the Catedral and built as a mosoleum for the Catholic Monarchs.  Isabel is laid to rest there with her husband (Ferdy) and two of her friends, Juanita the Mad, and Felipe the Fair.  That was about all that was good in the Chapel, which abounded in yet more pictures of jesus on the cross.  Word on the street is that it was designed to commemorate how hard it is to be a martyr.... like Ferdy and Isabel.  Not really worth the €3, but whatevs. THEN, we came back to the hostel and mobilized to go up into the Arab quarter.  We went to the Mirador de San Nicolas to watch the sun set, reflecting on the Alhmabra.  It was beautiful.  Then the Australian girl and I went into the Arab zone and walked around for a while.  We stopped at this Arab te´ infusion house.... so beautiful and different and fun.  The place with ornate with the geometricly intricate ornaments that are found all over the Alhambra and lit with candles.  We had tea that came in beautiful small tea pots and served in small glass tumblers.  The tea was so good, the ambience was so magical... I Loved It.  It was my favorite experience so far.  We spent a good amount of time there and then wandered down through what was once (and has been recreated for tourists) the silk market.  I am on the lookout for a beautiful scarf in a bright beautiful color to take as as souvenier.  Today we are going to the science museum and then up into the area of town where people live in caves!

       Holy Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ is it hot today. Its 40º C today... which is ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR DEGREES FARENHEIT. Its hotter outside my body than inside my body, which is simmering away at 98.6. But this is not the point of my story, merely the setting. Yesterday, after blogging, I went to the Tourism office and scoped out the goods. The best thing about Granada, for me, is the constant mention of Isabel the Catolica. All my life, I have been hearing about the Great and Glorious ¨Ferdinand and Isabela¨ who financed the upstart notions of Christopher Columbus, notable in the equal billing that Isabela gets whenever the efforts of this unbeatable team of monarchs are mentioned. This drew me to her... then there is the fact that Elizabeth I, who is very fascinating as well, is linked to them- since Henry VIIs first wife was the youngest daughter of Isabel and Ferdinand and it was she (Catherine of Aragon) who was divorced in order to facillitate the marriage of the King to Anne Boelyn, Elizabeth´s mother. Whew, what a run-on sentence. Anyway, it´s all very interesting... and so it was F&I who finally sucessfully beat off the Moors in Granada and reclaimed the area for Spain. So, there are millions of statues and stories about the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella and I am disposed to be interested in them all. SO... I thought about going to the Catedral, which F&amp;I built on the spot of the most important mosque and where they are burried, in a final act of sovereignty, but it was closed and I was tired. Instead, I returned to the hostal and met some people. I met Lena (from Alemania) and Bartek (from Poland) and talked to them and made plans to go to the Alhambra together the next day. Then we went and had free tapas (Free if you buy a drink!) and then I went to bed relatively early due to the 4 hours of sleep I got the night before. I woke up this morning at 8AM and we three went to the Alhambra... que bonita! I love the Moorish architecture, especially the reflecting pools and the geometric artwork. We bought one of those audio tours and so I am now well educated on the nature and history of the Alhmabra. We saw the palaces, the gardens, the ¨Generalife¨ (the palace that was used as a home for the Nadriz dynasty kings, away from courtly demands), and the miliary base. My favorite story is that of the Sultana and her Cypress tree in Generalife. In the location of the old baths (now formal gardens) grows an enormous cypress tree under which the Sulatana met her knight. They had romantic meetings under the Cypress tree until the Sultan found out and, of cours, beheaded them both. Meanwhile, the tree is STILL THERE, from the 13th century, though dead. It only died a few years ago... I think that´s AMAZING. Finally, after making a last ditch effort to be thorough and visiting the Military base we headed in search of shade and sangria. Finding both we refreshed ourselves, I bought postcards and then we walked back to the hostal and I took a siesta. Now we are gearing up for another round of Sangria and tapas... its dinner and a drink for €1,5. Can´t beat it! Tomorrow I am going to go to the Catedral and then on a hotel tren to Barcelona!
