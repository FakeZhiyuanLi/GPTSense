      I life in Jakarta, one of the worlds capital cities with the lousiest public transportation. Luckily, like so many other Jakartans, I'm one of the daily user. If you happen to use one of the luxurious PATAS AC route than it will not feel so lousy. In one of those, the passenger are often clean if not, well groom. They are ussualy young executive with neatly iron shirt's, bagy pants and handphones, or the sleazy yet clean students, or the occasionally mothers with their children going to one of the cities mall. Except for the  customary street singer selling their voices accompanied by their guitar or rice-filled-plastic bottle-instrument the ride should be quite enjoyable. It is a different story if you ride in the bang-up orange metromini's or the old rigidi rack green Maya Sari Bakti's. If u'r lucky to find a seat u'll find the seats are so close together that u'r knees  completely pressed on the back of the other seats in front of you.  Inside these buses or oversize-tin-can-filled with people, u can smell the sweet  odor of burnt oil, lubricants and the drivers continuously cigarette smoke all for Rp1.200,-. A good bargain aye? Once in a while u'll get lucky and find fascinating people riding along. You'll find street peddler carrying their huge plastic bags of colourfull childrens toys and u'll imagine not only how much it cost but how much profit each items give. U'll find girls with extremely overdone make up wearing overtight shirt that u just can't wait for it to burst. Worst off all finding you're self afraid of getting pick pocketed while the others around you think you're the pick pocket-er. Should you be one of the daily or just an occasional miss fortune user of these low price public transportation, keep an eye on your wallet, cellphone, bags and other belongings and enjoy the many other sight, smell, sound you are about to experiance.

      I can't remember the first step I took, nor the first sight I seen, even the first girl I had crush on. Instead I  remember my first love, my first and last motorcycle, my first public writing and soon I will remember this as my first e-publication. The first publication I remembered was about why I wanted to write. Back then it was only to practice and maybe someday it will be much use to my self or others. Between then and now my writing has been mocked at, laugh at, liked, loved even copied. I remember the smiles I seen after people read my writing.  I remembered the curses or verbal abuse on the same piece of paper. I guest, I should expect more of it in the times to come. This is just another way connecting to others in a more global sort of way. Not every connection is a good one, I expect good and bad with the same anxiety. So this me saying hello to all you readers. Enjoy, I hope more smiles than verbal insult to come from my writing. Should my writing generate verbal abuse than,  abuse your heart out  I can take it.
