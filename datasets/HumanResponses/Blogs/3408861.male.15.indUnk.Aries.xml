      Another day is going by I'm thinking about you all the time But you're out there And I'm here waiting  And I wrote this letter in my head Cuz so many things were left unsaid But now you're gone And I can't think straight  This could be the one last chance  To make you understand  I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Cuz somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything  Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me? Cuz I know I won't forget you  Together we broke all the rules Dreaming of dropping out of school And leave this place  To never come back  So now maybe after all these years If you miss me have no fear I'll be here I'll be waiting  This could be the one last chance to make you understand And I just can't let you leave me once again  I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Cuz somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything  Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me? Cuz I know I won't forget you  I close my eyes  And all I see is you I close my eyes I try to sleep I can't forget you Nanana (....) And I'd do anything for you Nanana (....)  I'd do anything Just to hold you in my arms To try to make you laugh Cuz somehow I can't put you in the past I'd do anything  Just to fall asleep with you Will you remember me? Cuz I know I won't forget you  I'd do anything To fall asleep with you I'd do anything There's nothing I won't do I'd do anything To fall asleep with you I'd do anything Cuz I know  I won't forget you

      I woke up it was 7  I waited till 11  Just to figure out that no one would call  I think i got a lot of friends but I don't hear from them  What's another night all alone?  When your spending everyday on your own  And here it goes   I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair  Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is  Having more fun than me  Tonight...  And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed  Staring at these 4 walls again  I'll try to think about the last time, I had a good time  Everyone's got somewhere to go  And they're gonna leave me here on my own and here it goes  I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair  Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is  Having more fun than me  What the hell is wrong with me?  Don't fit in with anybody  How did this happen to me?  Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep  And every night is the worst night ever   I'm just a kid   I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair  Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is  Nobody wants to be alone in the world.   I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid, I know that its not fair  Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is  Nobody wants to be alone in the world Nobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is Having more fun than me tonight  I'm all alone tonight  Nobody cares tonight  Cause I'm just a kid tonight
