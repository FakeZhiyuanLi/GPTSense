      1. iv never moved........ever. well i mean iv moved because im not sessile but iv had the same address my whole life  2. my parents painted my room green, i hated it but now i like it  3. on the 11th of february in 1987 the world was graced with my presence  4. and has had to since put up with me  5. im short due to lack of tall genes within my family  6. i want to learn how to surf  7. but have failed to go into the ocean past my shins (and when i did it was november...in vancouver. so one cant really blame me)  8. i actually enjoy living in vernon, most of the time.  9. i have a scar on my knee that was susposed to go away when i was thirteen, it didnt  10. i dont really have a favorite number but for many reasons im drawn to the numbers 17 and 2.  11. my closets orginized by colour and medium  12. iv always wanted an older brother  13. iv punctured my ears 6 times, the first two happened when i was 3 months, however as of today I only have 3 percings  14. I dont want a tattoo  15. I get really grumpy and moody  16. my favorite movie is bring it on  17. i love the OC  18. and I liked adam brody way before that show aired  19. ditto for rooney  20. and I have the demo and "marshmallow letters" sticker to prove it  21. I dislike it when people think their better then other people  22. Iv never really gone through a longish period of time where I didn't on some level want to be somebody's girlfriend, until now  23. im afraid of heights if I know I have to jump down  24. I get sunburnt really easy  25. Iv never had a pet of my own  26. if my legs were in porpution to my upper body id be taller then I am  27. I was dropped on my head as a child  28. and still manage to never let my GPA slip below a 3.0  29. I went to camp for 5 summers in a row  30. all and 5 years I went with amanda (for most of those years laura was present)  31. i havent been to a zoo since i was ten and dont plan on ever going back  32. Iv never been out of canada, and iv only been out of BC to go to calgary  33. I plan on going to mexico, california, trinidad and tobago, thailand, the bermuda triangle, london, italy and switerzland. ..........and the north pole -so I can then walk around it and claim to have walked around the world  34. I love being on stage and having a spotlight on me  35. yet never have really truly wanted to be a famous actress or in a band  36. except ofcourse in grade 5 and 6 when I wanted to become a spice girl  37. the first time I ever slept in a tent was in kristines backyard in grade six  38. Iv probaly been "almost-best-friends" with every girl who went to kidston at some point in time  39. I don't have normal body tempture because I climated my body to the tempture at school and I havent been able to switch back since  40. I live in my parents basement  41. they give me $5 a week......thats basically the only source of income I have  42. I like buying shirts  43. and brushing my teeth  44. aside from charlotte dimond iv never been to a "real" concert (I have however been to shows and festivals)  45. I keep everything quite organized  46. and aside from my bed being unmade and the occasional article of clothing or waterbottle my room is clean  47. I have my own bathroom and have trained everyone else to use the upstairs one  48. I also basically have my own TV room  49. in which iv claimed a large chair as my own  50. I still use my baby blanket....only I don't sleep with it  51. I do however sleep with an incredibly large teddy bear that was davids but then wound up in my sisters closet  52. one of my favorite memories is watching TGIF with david on the hid-a-bed when we were kids  53. another is when I picked "snowballs" from my grandma's flowering tree and brought them home and danced with them in my raingear as it rained  54. I enjoy rain, and adore thunderstorms at night  55. I get excited about blue moons  56. I wear contacts  57. and LOVE sunglasses  58. ever since grade eight iv been subscribed to  seventeen   57. My real names elizabeth  58. when I was nine my mother gave birth to a girl and named her Mary Jane Burroughs, she didn't find out that mary jane was code for pot until after, I still find it amusing that I was nine and knew that.  59. I like walking at night when its dark  60. Iv ridden on a harley davison  61. Im going to OUC  62. and living in california  63. theres this spot between the trees that I go to in the summer  64. I love meeting new people but im to shy to approach them  65. this whole year iv felt my age  66. I like it when things change  67. I dislike having to wear a bra sometimes  68. one of the best things about summer is when I can look for shooting stars  69. I'm quite content with my life, even though I am lacking a life  70. I like finding new bands  71. i want to have kids, but I dont really want to have a husband as much  72. although I do want to have a wedding  73. if I dont have a previous commitment I spend the day in sweats and dont do my hair or makeup  74. I can be quite picky about things  75. shopping makes me feel better  76. I dont like to use cell phones because they cause brain tumors  77. this is also a reason why I'm not around chuck often  78. I havent eaten fast food in over a year, and that was only a one time thing because there was no other source of food for quite awhile, so in the past 3 years iv eaten fast food like 2-3 times. this bothers kylie  79. SHE bothers me  80. Im slightly alergic to smoke, and mosquitoe repellent  81. sadly mosquitoes tend to like me  82. I was named after my grandma and my nana  83. when i was eight I decided that on my first day of highschool I would change my name to Betty  84. I read archie comics too much back then  85. I like the way my hair smells after I've been in a pool  86. I have hair  87. its brown  88. this summer I'm going to write a book  89. and in september when we go back I dont want to be the same person I was this year  90. my favorite perfume is truth by ck 92. I have a "my little pony" named butterscoch, he sits on my cd player 93. which is a beast, but iv had it since i was nine and i love it 94. I actualy enjoy not having plans that run into the late night on saturday night because ellen, the nanny and snl are on 95. But i get cabin fever VERY easly 96. I went through a phase where&nbsp;I named appliences, I was sixteen 97. theres something about the 80s that makes me happy 98.&nbsp; when theres no school I watch the view 99. the song 99 red ballons (the original version) reminds me of my cousin and how we release red balloon on her birthday 100. people ask me what im going to do with my life, I dont have an answer. I have no problem with that
