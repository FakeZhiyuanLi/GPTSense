      "Jesus Said, 'Your attitude must be like my own, for I, the Messiah, did not come to be served, but to serve and to give my life." Matthew 20:27-28  Point to Ponder: Service is not optional.  God's plan and fourth purpose for our life is service to others When we serve others, we serve God. God created us to make a unique contribution with our life. We each have a role, a purpose, a function to fulfill. I'm still not sure what mine is. I do mentor work, but I know I can do more. We are accountable for what we do with our lives. We are to serve and to give. Anytime we use our God-given abilities to help others, we are fulfilling our calling. Why serve? Because study without service leads to spiritual stagnation. Ok, so I do mentoring work,and I give to charities, but what is my calling? I'm still searching. I have read chapter 30 and it talks about our abilities, our talents, but I think I've been caught up in the word "talents" and focused on that word in the wrong way. a talent doesn't have to be being a great vocalist or a great artist, or a great businessman, or a great musician, or a great social worker.. a talent is something you are good at and enjoy. I'll talk about it more in the next chapter, perhaps tomorrow night. But the food for thought I have for today in discovering talents, is it can be something as simple as someone who enjoys delivering Meals on Wheels, or transporting people to the doctor who have no other way to get there, or shopping for food for a shut-in, or cooking a meal or baking for a bake sale to raise money for a cause.. the amount of things that are talents is enormous!!!!!!! so what are mine? I'll be focusing on that in the next week or so.. see what I come up with. God bless... LeAnn

       "If it seems slow,do not despair, for these things will surely come to pass. Just be patient! They will not be overdue a single day!" Habakkuk 2:3 LB  Point to Ponder: There are no shortcuts to maturity.  This chapter was good for me, for I am, by nature, an impatient person when it comes to my own growth. It doesn't matter what that growth pertains to, I always feel I am too slow, but I must remember that I grow at a pace that is right for me and I cannot rush it. Things that are rushed are not ripened to their full potential, yes? God wants us to grow strong and we worry about are we growing fast enough. I have these worries. I feel like I take 2 steps forward and 1 step back. My journey is a journey of a lifetime and this is what I must remember! I let petty everyday things bog me down and depress me. My focus is on the wrong thing. I am a slow learner. It takes time to shed our old self, our old habits. I need to replace my old habit of self-absorption with the new habit of serving God, serving others, and fellowship. I feel like my mentoring is one way I serve God, but I need to do more. I need to find what my talents are and use them for His glory, since they are given to me by Him. Hopefully I can discover those talents as I am reading.. learning a way to recognize them and learn to see that a "talent" doesn't have to be something extravagant like being a great artist or great orator. There are thousands of talents out there that some people don't see as a talent. I'll get more into that in another chapter. But basically, what I am saying is 1.) I need to change my old ways by putting on new ways of living. I'm not goign to suddenly change, no matter how much I wish I could. I won't magically turn into the perfect Christian (but no one is perfect) 2.) I have to grow into it to be strong. 3.) It is hard, but rewarding work and we glorify God by becoming what HE planned for us.  It takes PRACTICE. I must not get discouraged with myself and I must be patient with myself AND with God. His timetable is rarely the same as ours, and it is His timetable that determines our growth.

      Point to Ponder: There is always a way out.  "God is faithful. He will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can't stand up against it. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it." 1 Corinthians 10:13b (NLT)  "...nowhere in the Bible are we told to 'resist temptation'. We are told to 'resist the devil', but that is very different.." Wow.. this was something that blew my mind away.. I'd always felt I was so wrong to be tempted, to have feelings of being tempted to do things that werent' right, but it was a relief to me to know that it's just a part of being human. The part of being Christ-like is resisting that temptation. I know there have been times in my life that I wondered "what's the point?" because I felt I had already committed a sin by even thinking it in the first place. (See how some churches screw with our heads and make us feel so impossibly dirty that we just give in to what tempts us in the first place? I know I did.) Warren tells us that trying to resist a thought does not work. It merely intensifies it... drives it deeper into our memory. "You don't fight a temptation by fighting the feeling of it.".. you ".. change the channel of your mind and get interested in another idea." I totally agree that the battle for sin is won or lost in your mind. I can see that is true in my life. I already knew, when I was contemplating doing something wrong, that I was going to do it before I did it. "Whatever gets your attention will GET YOU." yep... let's see.. I tried to count the times this has happened to me but it wasn't possible. What gets our attention arouses our emotions and our emotions activate our behavior and we act on our feelings. (Yep.. true of me, too.) Warren is right, too, that we need to confide in a godly friend when we have these feelings. This has worked for me. Nick is that person for me. I have confessed to him so many times feelings I've had and he has listened to me and talked to me, without judgement, and helped me to see what was really going on and that has given me strength to fight the urge to give in to a temptation. Of course, sometimes I've given in first and talked to him about it later and he helped me to see where I have gone wrong. I know I'd have given in to a lot more if I hadn't had him to talk things out with. I can't will myself out of temptation, but have to give it to God and sharing with others these feelings with someone who will hold us accountable, pray for us, love us unconditionally, encourage us, that is what gives us strength because we can't do it alone. And it is egotistical to think we can. We cannot argue with the devil because he is so much better at it that we are, and we can't logic with him because that doesn't work either, but we can use the truth of God because that is what he is afraid of. Warren states this is why we need to memorize scripture, but I have not been good at that.. i have so much to work on. I know I will never be beyond temptation, and I know, now that it isn't wrong to be tempted.. it is only wrong to give into it.

      Point to Ponder: Every temptation is an opportunity to do good.  "God blesses the people who patiently endure testing. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. " James 1:12 (NLT)  something to throw out there: have you ever been in a situation that you knew deep down was not right, but you justified it to the point that you had yourself believe that God wanted you to do this thing? This chapter was especially interesting for me and a learning experience. I know that most of my life my temptations have been based on my own insecurities. Temptation starts in our mind not in circumstances.. and we give in to whatever has our attention. We even deceive ourselves into thinking that a particular sin really isn't so bad.. or wondering if it is really wrong. Basically.. it is our way of justifying doing what we know deep down is wrong but we want it so bad that we logic it out.. at least this has been my standard M.O. ... I have spent the last few months trying to figure out a lot about myself and it is very confusing. I know the things in my life I have justified, told myself that God wanted me to have these things, do these things, and they have been absurd if I looked at it objectively, but we can't be objective when our emotions are in control. it just isn't possible. And when you have two people who feed off the other's emotion, well it's damn near impossible to be objective. I've been in that situation where I made something i knew was wrong right in my head. I had an intense love for someone that I acted on and I knew it was wrong.. I cannot believe, though, that it was wrong for me to love this person. That love was pure and real. But the circumstances should have told me that I couldn't act on it.... but I wanted this so badly, and so did he, that we convinced ourselves that it was "meant to be". He was my soulmate, my best friend, the person I trusted with my life. I'd never been so comfortable, so willing to be vulnerable to the point I didn't feel vulnerable with with him at all. We could finish the other's sentences, read each other's mind, feel what the other felt even miles away. It was intoxicating, exciting, deeply intense, and we just felt that God must be bringing us to each other. I ignored every subtle sign I was given that this was wrong. We parted ways several times, only to come back together again months later.. unable to stay away. I did not want to be helped.. I didn't see I needed help. eventually I became so miserable because of circumstances and dropped to my knees to ask God to show me a not so subtle sign that I was on the right road, and if not, show me a new road. And He did! it was hard, though. I still loved this person, still had the temptation, but God gave me a new road and the strength to walk it. I'll always love this person, and I will never believe loving this person was wrong, but I do, now, agree that it was wrong for us to act on it. that is why this chapter was so important to me. It helped me realize that it isn't wrong to be tempted, it is only wrong to give in to it. We are all tempted and we have no control over WHAT we are tempted with, but we do have control, and strength through God, to not give in to what we are tempted by. It is a hard conclusion to come to. It isn't easy doing the right thing.. sometimes it is excruciating. and sometimes we fall and give in, but it isn't fatal (which I will get into in the next chapter) But now I believe I am where I am supposed to be. and I also believe that this road I traveled before, a paradox filled with wonder and misery, brought me to where I am now, to a place where I am ready to listen to God, to do what He wants of me, to become the person He wants me to become.
