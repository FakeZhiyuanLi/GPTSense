						    She sounds very Motown. Actually, it sounds very similar to the beginning of "You make me feel like a natural Woman." I had to listen to Aretha Franklin's song, to get the connection. But I still dig it.    "If I Ain't Got You" A. Keys    Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things  Define what's within I've been there before But that life's a bore So full of the superficial   Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you   Some people search for a fountain Promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them   And in a world on a silver platter And wondering what it means No one to share, no one who truly cares for me   Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you   Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you   If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby

						   And I mean the astrological sign. People born under the sign Cancer, around this time of month actually, tend to be my favourite people to associate with. Humorous, intelligent, emotional and sensitive. I can dig it.   One of my best friends, Ryan, who just recently came back into town, i see him about four months out of the year. He's a Cancer. His birthday is at the end of June, and I could honestly say, he's probably the only man I connect with on almost every single level except sexually.     Dave, He's a cancer too,a close friend, our conversations usually consisting soley of teasing and banter.   Josee, an old co worker of mine, who I would deliberately take my coffee break with at the end of her shift, and I swear, that I would have tears running down my face by the end of my break from laughing so hard. Unfortunately for me, Josee moved to Fort McMurray, and I haven't seen her in about six months. Devin, well, I adore that man. For my own reasons, which He cant see, or chooses not to see, or maybe even does see. I don't know anymore. Regardless of what goes on between us, I've never stopped. I don't think I ever will.  Lately I've been listening to Alicia Keys, "Diary of Alicia Keys" album. It's quite good, and for the frame of mind I've been in lately I'm not sure if it is helping or making things worse. She sings about love. Like most singers do, but almost all of her songs are about it. A few of her songs are quite similar to the first album she put out, being "Songs in A Minor" which was very good as well.  Somehow Alicia, put a spin on it this time,  maybe because her first album was designed to be more acceptable to every group, but this time it makes her sound more, well... Black I guess, for lack of a better term. There's some funk tossed in there, like the song "Heart burn" which amusingly enough in my head the first few times I heard it, I couldn't shake the notion of it being a commercial for Pepto Bismol. (Tastes so good, makes my stomach ache? LOL!)  Other than that, it's totally funkedelic, and quite enjoyable. *shrugs* The porno style bowmp chicka bowmp bowmp, guitar in it is another reason to dig it. Another song on it titled, "When you really Love Someone" that is reminiscent of "A Womans Worth" from her first album. Similar, but obviously not identical. All in all, it seems like a good album, but it's one that I bought on impulse, listened to it for the first time, kinda went, "Naaaah..." And put it on the shelf for a few months. I decided to give it a second try. It grows on you. Sorta like those warts the doctor said needed to be burned off.

						   The penguins I mean. These birds take a licking and keep right on ticking.   I'm talking about the Yeti Games that I was introduced to about six months ago. They're fun little games where I actually felt bad for beating the shit out of these penguins with my Yeti ice baseball bat, and seeing how far I could wail on these motherfuckers. Yet somehow, it was addictive. For a while. Now it seems there has been a spin off on the original game, you can twirl them around like the hammer in PE class and launch them up a ice covered gorge (Yes, I know. How erotic...) Or, (magically enough!) Penguins and Yeti are transported to Africa, where you play golf using a Flamingo. (A Flamingo?)... Whatever. And smash the poor buggers into the ground, or trees, or Elephants and Giraffes for that matter.   Anyways, it's as good a thing to play to kill time as any other, and the games are easy enough to play once you get the hang of them. Check it out at  http://www.yetisports.org And go smash the shit out of some penguins.   That's what those stupid birds get for not being able to fly.  "Nothing like an Abominable Snowman to leave the men scared, and the women longing for furry Yeti goodness." ~Travis

						   Now, when i was younger, and still do actually, I read quite a few fantasy novels. It's one of my favourite type of books to read.   Tonight I went and attended a medieval society dance lesson. What a riot. I'm planning on going again, and again, AND again, until I get the steps down pat.   Also, while I was there, Mel, the girl that introduced me to this group of people. Told me that they are looking for female archers. As far as I can recall, I was a damned good archer in PE class in highschool. Lets just say that my curiousity is definitely peaked.   AND   The society will be holding a "war" in mid September. I'm stoked. I'm planning on attending a few archery practises, and seeing how well I can pull it off. If I'm skilled enough, you bet your solid gold arse that I'm going to get as much practise in there as possible till September, and attending that war to compete. (And hopefully win.) I've always had a soft spot for the archers, bards, and the elves in those novels of mine. All I can picture is me in my dark brown suede pants, a pair of knee high black boots, a white scoop neck blouse and a corset laced up so damned tight, that it makes my tits look great. Not to mention a bow, and a quiver full of arrows.   So yeah, I'm a nerd. Deal with it. Just don't stand in front of me, when I've got that bow pulled tight.

						   It's been a week or so since my last post, I've been a busy girl.   I had one of my best friends over on Saturday night, Crystal is a girl I met in Math class about eight years ago in grade ten or so, and we've been through so much shit in our relationship, (As in getting into it. Oh lord have we done stupid stuff. LOL.) and having been separated for a few years because of separate romantic relationships, etc, but the best part is that when we hook up again, we slide back into our regular routine. Like nothing ever happened, and to me, that means that she is a true friend.  Crystal and I, Had a great conversation Saturday afternoon, about men and relationships. Men don't seem to realize that apart from all the romantic shit that they THINK we want, all we want are the simple things. The things that make us feel appreciated. Like a phone call at night to say goodnight if you don't happen to live together. Just a phone call. But most men, at least in both her and my scenario's, don't do that. Actually in most of my friends relationships, they don't do that. I'm in a rather difficult position right now relationship wise, where the ONLY person I want to be with the most is too far away for it to be feasible, and also, too busy to give me a response to anything I send him, being text messages, or emails, phone calls or online messages. And it's heartbreaking.  It's not to say I don't understand. Actually, I completely understand. I can't really imagine myself content with anyone else. I probably shouldn't even be writing this in here, but the moment I saw his picture in Hot or not of all places, I was captivated. And its this stupid feeling of a girl in love, the vulnerability that I absolutely despise, that is part of the reason why I'm so frustrated. The anguished longing where I tell myself that I don't fucking care if he responds, but damnit. I do. Over the last month, He's been working SO much that I get maybe five minutes a week to communicate with him for actual conversation, and a couple sentences tossed in here or there on Yahoo or MSN messenger. It's not really my fault or his. I can't lay blame anywhere, and I've been trying to keep myself so busy lately to distract myself from his absence.  I've got people interested in me here. But honestly, my heart isn't in it. And it makes me feel horrible. They are decent guys, I don't know exactly how they feel about me, and tossing them into the mix, or making them second choice when I know who I want to be with is really fucking with my head. And also completely unfair to them. The burning sense of loneliness, when I know I could have someone here, is fucking with my head too. I'm terribly confused. Matters of the heart are the most complicated of all, because love really does fuck with your judgment. It's also the strongest, most amazing emotion of all. I don't like finding solace in the arms of others. I don't like being deceptive that way.   At this point in time, I'm so flippin confused, that I don't know what to do. I'm caught on the edge of despair, and clinging to hope. I don't know if I should give up entirely, although it would hurt both himself and I immensely, but I'm torn.

						   Well, back to work today and other than the teasing about me trying to become some hot fresh buns...(Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear the comments already.) It was fairly uneventful. Almost pleasant. Almost.  I've found myself listening to Evanescence a lot, having borrowed it from a friend a few weeks ago and have had it in my Discman quite frequently since then. The music seems to put me in a melancholy mood, not surprising since Amy Lee, with her phenomenal vocals, has dark lyrics. She sorta reminds me of some psychotic pixie, or elfin type of gal, facially anyways. And actually, in her latest music vid, she puts on a few different persona's selling products called "Lies". She's actually quite pretty, in a freaky sort of way. I can't quite mimic her voice perfectly, but CAN hit the notes she does, so I put my own spin on it. I find myself belting it out along with her in my Apartment, or on the bus or street for that matter. The combination of her Operatic vocals and the distorted metal of the guitar, seem to appeal to me. Pretty damned good for a band that used to be hardcore Christian.  The Roomie has gone house sitting for two weeks for a friend that's gone to England, to watch her cat. The moving date for her and I is approaching quickly. It's only one floor up and down the other end of the building, so it shouldn't be a difficult move, by any means. I'm getting excited about decorating the new pad up, and she quite handily tossed me a home decorating mag that she got in the mail from Home Depot or somesuch place... I think I'll take a gander at it sometime in the next few days, and see what this brain of mine can conjure up.  I found my new favourite perfume. Hypnotic Poison by Christian Dior. Fuck, dude, this stuff rocks! It's got a very unique fragrance. It's pricy though. I'm sure I attracted the saleslady's attention at the Bay in my "Erotic" hoodie and jeans and runners, more for the fact that she thought I was going to rip it off, than be interested in buying it. I didn't however. (Buy it or rip it off.) Maybe another day, when I've got a hundred bucks to burn. A little too much to stink pretty.  Annnnyways, it's off to Karaoke tonight, Mizz Liz is hosting, and its always fun to play kamikaze Karaoke when she's spinning the discs. Last time it was "I'm a slave 4 u" by Brittany Spears. Good Lord. I swore I wouldn't sing that after the first time I sang it. It's fun to sing along with in the car. That's about it. *smirk* See Y'all on the flip side.

						   It was an hour and a half wait before I could even see the doctor and the worst choice in footwear to walk around the mall I've ever chosen, being my supah high 3.5" heeled club boots. BUT, It's all good Kids. Like I thought, other than being sausage like and not to pretty at the moment, (Although the swelling HAS gone down lots) and I'm all broken bone free. Hooray!

						   At the best of times, I'm never graceful. Actually, I'm quite clumsy, with moments of brilliance that make people think I'm graceful.  The reason I'm saying this is because on Saturday, I tried to remove my left index and middle finger at work. Fun stuff. Without getting too technical, because you really do have to understand the machinery that I was working on, I basically got those fingers squished between a very strong compression plate on the top, and a moving belt that had cup shaped holes in it, which was underneath my hands, and my fingers were IN, that had a large, sharp, "screw" shaped object, because Kaiser buns have that swirl on the top of them right? That was probably a millimeter from my fingertips... How it missed my fingers, I haven't the slightest. But I'm friggin lucky. Combine that with about 40 to 60 pounds of hydraulic pressure, from the compression plate, and it scared the hell out of me.  So my doctor at the clinic isn't letting me work until my x-rays come back, and in the meanwhile, It looks like I've got sausages attached to my hand. I don't think anything is seriously wrong with them other than being swollen and a little bruised. I can bend them, but they do feel really odd. And sometimes in the evening, I get a shooting pain in my knuckles. But I can type and I'm pretty sure I can do the shit I need to do at work, I'm not all that confident that THAT much exercise will be beneficial to my fingers just yet but I'm willing to try.  I accidentally left my phone on silent this morning, and when I woke up, I had a message from a rather stern sounding woman from the Workers Compensation Board on there. I think they will accept my claim. I've heard of bakers doing the same darned thing that have 20 years of experience. I would cross my fingers. But that might hurt.  On another note. Yesterday, I was the WebMistress yet again designing pages for my "friends" website. She's a professional domme, (Yes, for all you kids out there that don't know what I'm talking about that's S&M and Domination and submission.) Now. I am by no means a professional at website design. But I'm damned proud of myself. I worked HARD at this website and it's getting recognition. By professional domme lists. I did everything on this site, including photography and subsequent editing on photoshop, colour scheme, creative writing and editing, and refining the logo, that my mom did the basis of. This website has been added to THREE professional Domme/Domina lists. And its nice to know that I can impress professionals. It makes me feel like my hard work, and trust me I worked on this thing for hours upon hours... Is going to go somewhere.   I've done Advertising dressed up in a Naughty nurse costume for this website at fetish events, true, it was basically an excuse to go drool over some PVC Clad hotties, and dance all dirty-like, but mostly Solo to the awesome tunes, drink and glow from head to foot in blacklights... But I did do some mingling with the attendee's, and left big ol stacks of business cards at the bar and the entrance/exit. Whilst my partner-in-crime, shmoozed to her hearts content and learned some interesting things from other pro domme's in the lower mainland. So if you are curious, go check it out.  urlLink www.mdivona.com    Alright  kids. I gotta go put my contacts in. It's hard to type four inches from the screen.

						   And so begins the start of my blogging. Fabulous! This is something I've been contemplating for quite a while now, it was suggested by a few friends, that know me, that find me entertaining and amusing enough in chats and in real life, that know that I can write quite well. They think that my opinions are valid, but thats niether here nor there... lol. thats up to you kids. I LOVE getting comments. So by all means. Feel free. I enjoy entertaining people, so it's up to me to differentiate what I decide to disclose on this. It's going to be a great learning process.  I'm looking forward to it...and to top it all off, I'm doing it naked. (Well sorta...)  Giddyup. It's 30 degrees Celcius here in the shade, (The hottest it's been in ages) and I don't friggin' well care if I'm clad in bra and khaki's. Nor, the fact that my blinds are open. Hell, I want a breeze. My socially inept neighbors across the alley can get their voyeuristic kicks off all they want...

						   I heard a song by  Tim McGraw  on the Radio today. I'm not a huge fan of Country music, but this one struck a chord in me. Its called  "Live Like You Were Dyin'."   Maybe it's something we all should do. The lyrics can be found  urlLink here.    I'll have an in depth post coming up about a fabulous mixed Blues and Jazz CD that Luc made up for me soon.

						   I've been getting tattoos since I was 20 years old or so. Despite the warnings that they are permanent, and the comments, "What about when your 80 years old and your skin is saggy, blah, blah, blah..."     Honestly, by the time I'm 80 years old, I'll be fat, in a Muu-muu, and no one will care if I have tattoos etched permanently on my skin, because they won't SEE them. Either that, Or dead, according to  urlLink my results  on  urlLink www.deathclock.com.      My choice in Tattoos, being mythical lizard-like creatures, (3 dragons, and a rainbow gecko) are for my own enjoyment. They hold special meaning to me, because of the development of my character over the past few years, and the things I have done while in the process of living life and growing up.     I must confess, I got my first tattoo to piss off my first boyfriend. He was controlling, abusive and "Didn't like tattoos." I chose to stand up for myself and get one anyways. I had wanted one since I was about 12 years old.     As far as I know, I'm the ONLY person in my family with tattoos. Other than my cousin Andrew, who, when he saw me get my first shoulder blade inked up, was inspired to then get his done after seeing the process. I chose all of mine, when I walked into the parlours where I got them done, on the day I got them done.     I have only pre-planned ONE tattoo. and that is my final one, which is going to be situated either low on the centre of my neck, or high between my shoulder blades. It's the Japanese symbol for "Hope." (Kibou) It took me a long time to find this symbol, and it was the only caricature I saw fitting, other than "Love," and perhaps "Music."     For me, hope, is sometimes all I have to hold on to. It can be something crushing and misleading, and also inspiring. For someone like myself who is ruled mostly by emotions, even when I am at my worst place mentally, when the world weighs heavily upon me, hope is something that helps me through it. I usually try to see things with a light at the tunnel even though it's exceedingly difficult at times.     Life is not pleasant right now. I feel lost, in my heart. I am so FUCKED financially right now It's not even funny, and I'm feeling lost in my life in general. You'll have to pardon the lack of enthusiam in my posts, or the somewhat down tone that it portrays. I'm working on it.

						   It's nice to get free stuff.     I won four CD's at  The Roxy  last night, and quite contrary to the belief that they are the shittiest prizes you can win on the  "Molson Waaaaaallll of Prizes!"   (But, only because it's not the MONEY)    It's actually some pretty damned good music.       "Best of the British"     (Virgin records compilation sampler, Various artists, 2002, Annual release.)      This compilation, contains everything from  The Who, "Babe 'O Riley,"   Rod Stewart, "Maggie May"  (one of my favourite songs of all time.) Classic 80's kitsch band  Madness  with  "Our House," Squeeze , singing  "Tempted"  which was used recently in a jeans commercial, (There's nothing like a song about infidelity to make me want a pair of jeans. *Smirks*)  Joe Cocker  singing a very soulful, blues/jazz live version of  "She came in Through the Bathroom Window."  (I love a unique voice. It's scratchy, and growly and utterly hot. Too bad this song was big in 1969.)  Tricky, "Black Steel"  (Trip-Hop from the frontwoman formerly  known from her stuff in  Massive Attack )  Supertramp, "Bloody Well Right"  to  Stereo MC, "Connected."  (I  LOVE  that song.)         Best of the British, "No Sunshine, Loads of Music."     (Virgin records Compilation sampler, Various Artists, 2003, Annual release.)      This compilation contains various songs, including  Culture Club, "Church of the Poisoned Mind," David Bowie, "Heroes"  a very inspirational pre punk era song by the  Buzzcocks,   entitled   "Ever Fallen in Love?"    Duran Duran, "Girls on Film" Talk Talk, "It's My Life."  (Recently covered by  No Doubt ) And a  FANTASTIC   acoustic  version of  Dirty Vegas, "Days Go By"  made popular by a recent car commercial, but slower and by doing so, shows fabulous versatility of the band.     Both are thoroughly enjoyable. And apparently, you can't purchase these in the Virgin records stores. They are  "promotional use only"  so only a select few people have them. Nice. (Of course, everyone that wins on that damned "Wall of Prizes" usually ends up winning one of these things. I just happened to win 4 of them. Oooh, lucky number 24.)      More updates on the other two CD's once I listen to them.      As an aside, apparently  urlLink The Roxy  is kaiboshing the Karaoke they've held there for five and a half years. Drag. The last bout of contestants to enter in "Vancouver Idol" is this coming up Monday. I'm not sure if I am going to go yet or not.

						   Alright. Here goes.      I've come to the conclusion, even hung over, and exhausted from sleep deprivation and my first day back at work after ten days, that I can't stop thinking. My mind is always working, and half the time, it's thinking of ways to write a new entry  for this effing blog.  I woke up a part of my mind that had been dormant for a long time, and now it seems that the beast is quite restless.      I wanted to write about what I feel about "Online Relationships," but didn't want it to be some sort of bible-thumping rant.     Basically, I was involved in a six month relationship with someone I had never met. That situation ended abruptly, very recently.     You have to understand that for me, finding a man to associate with sexually, is not a problem. As a matter of fact, sometimes I feel that its entirely TOO easy to find someone to fuck around with.     What I had a problem with, was finding someone that I clicked with emotionally, and mentally. Someone that I felt I had a connection with other than physically. And an online relationship, is exactly that. (For me, anyways.) It's a way to find out about someone, to communicate, based soley on words expressed on a computer screen.     And it's horribly easy to be trapped in one.      So easy that its the third relationship I've had online. (And for the record, I've never really told many people this.) Call me naive. Call me foolish or stupid. But for me, that sense of emotional/mental bonding, was so incredibly alluring, that I found it hard to resist.     I met Devin on Hot or Not, as I've mentioned in a previous post, while I was dating someone else exclusively. He was a good friend. He was someone to banter with and tease lightheartedly. We had a lot in common. I was friends with him for about six months. We chatted online regularly, and on the phone occasionally, just as friends. Until my relationship with Erik, who I was devoted to, fell through.     Devin was there. He heard my misery, because the breakup with Erik was pretty unexpected, and the stories I had told him about Erik's and my relationship, after the split, I tried to keep fairly unbiased. He listened to me. He listened to me through my anger, and my pain and my regret. He lent me a sympathetic ear, and a calming perspective. He did what a friend was supposed to do. Even though he lives in Texas.     I had always been attracted to him, and after a while of being single, I found myself attracted to Him even more, based on that stability. Based on that caring, and all of the things we had in common. Based on his phenomenal personality, his intelligence and wit. And I fell for him. Even though I KNEW that he lived so far away, even though I KNEW that it probably didn't have a snowballs chance in hell of making it work out. And I said, to Hell with it, and tossed my inhibitions to the wind. "Love like you've never been hurt." they say. The communication with him never ceased, He sent me a Christmas present. I called him just to wish him a Merry Christmas and tell him I loved him, on Christmas Day. It was so difficult, being far away from each other, but it was  so damned good  at the same time. And it was unbelievably sweet. I loved him, probably more than I cared to admit. And I thought he felt the same.     His phone/net apparently was cut off in early January, of 2004, And I didn't receive a response from him for a little over 2 weeks to anything I sent him. I remained incommunicado with him for almost four months. I thought about him almost every day. On a whim, I had been looking at his blog and decided to see that if I provoked him with a response to one of his posts, if he would talk to me again. It worked. He had thought that my hurt questioning, wondering if he was alright, wondering if He had met someone and was too afraid to tell me, and finally just the words, "I give up." had blown his chances with me... No. I gave him another chance.     I don't think I should have.      He got a new job. He was working approximately 18 hours a day. Or so he says. I don't know what to believe anymore. I really don't. I tried my best to be supportive. But it was getting harder on me, to be alone, and I was dating around when he had stopped talking the first time. I paused on that momentarily, for about a month, and then continued to date other people. Hiding my status as "Long Distance Girlfriend" for the first while because I didn't want to feel stupid, and because most men, when they hear that phrase, they hear "Desperate for Loving. Will do anything."     And after feeling guilty for not being completely honest, I didn't bother to hide it at all, and made sure that it was one of the first things I said, to avoid leading them on. Because after all, I did have a sexual appetite, as well as a need for companionship that was not being fulfilled. I just clarified immediately that I was not looking for "A relationship." Because my heart belonged to Devin.     The loneliness got harder and harder to bear, I missed him. (How on earth you miss someone you have never met, is very difficult to explain.) I had discussed with him coming up here for a vacation of his own, and it was most likely going to occur to the best of my knowledge, when I went for MY holiday that I just recently had. However, unforeseen circumstances changed that, and I booked my holiday a week earlier than I had planned with him, because I had waited so long between them, and his trip was to be postponed until possibly September when I could schedule my next vacation.     I became somewhat demanding of his time, not that he had much to spare. And I can see from his perspective how that could have either irritated or freaked him out. Or both. But with me, if a relationship is not progressive, or if I am becoming unhappy with something regarding it (ie, our separation for such a length of time) I am most definitely going to speak my mind. I told him countless times, when he was at his wits end with everything around him, if he needed to confide in someone, to call me. If he needed someone to cry to on the phone, I would be there to be best of my ability. I tried my hardest to be what he needed, I tried my hardest to show that I was proud of him, and told him so on a regular basis, for all that he was struggling through and what he was achieving. But know that I failed in a lot of aspects. I can't lay the blame wholly upon myself, though.     I made the mistake of phoning him, after Crystal's barbeque, when I had had too much alcohol to drink and was feeling vulnerable, and alone, and leaving a rather emotional message on his Voicemail. But what else was I supposed to do? I had told him that I would be there for him, if not as a physical presence, than as a supportive, consoling, vocal presence. Was that supposed to be a one way street? I don't think so. That's not the way relationships, (even long distance ones) work.     Two days later, communication stopped. At least from HIM.      He stopped responding to my messages online, to my text messages, to my messages on his voicemail... He was online, and he wouldn't respond to me. That, I think was the most hurtful thing of all. You can block someone on MSN from seeing you online, and he didn't even bother to have the decency to do that. He just ignored me. I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't know what to think.     Is he married, and his spouse found out? Is he disgusted with me? Is he tired of having to keep up with my somewhat demanding attitude for attention? I have no reasons from him. He won't even acknowledge me. All I know, is that I'm in a world of hurt, and I have no answers for all the questions running through my brain.    And that I'm through chasing him. As curious/frustrated as I am about what is going on, I'm not desperate, and I have my pride.    He's off my lists on Yahoo/MSN, and I don't plan on contacting him again anytime soon. Elizabeth says I'm being entirely too nice to even THINK of contacting him with the intention of salvaging a friendship. Maybe, just maybe, I will a few months down the road, to see if he strapped on some balls and can perhaps act like a grown up. I won't slam him any further, however him leading me on most certainly makes me think he deserves a fuck of a lot more than the modest amount I have.    What bothers me the most is that I honestly thought he was a decent person. It really makes me reconsider the way I look at people, and the level of trust that I give them.

						   I've been listening to:   "This is Not a Test"   (Missy Elliot, Elektra Entertainment, 2003)       For those of you that don't know, I'm a huge fan of Hip Hop in general as long as the content is progressive, stimulating and intelligent.   Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliot.  She's the ultimate BBW. (Big Beautiful Woman.) Rich, Gorgeous, and very,  very  talented. She also has shitloads of confidence and fantastically dirty lyrics. She's not afraid to say whatever the hell strikes her at the moment. Her stuff is very reminiscent of 'Old School rap.' Maybe its why I dig her so much.  Her partner in creative crime,  Timbaland , has wicked mixing abilities and beat creation skills. Not to mention one of the hottest voices EVER.  Check out the song  "Let It Bump"  where he does his own verse. I almost creamed my jeans the first time I heard his voice on it's own.   There is also the currently released songs on this album, being  "Pass That Dutch"  "Wake Up" (feat Jay-Z)  and  "I'm Really Hot"   She features several different artists on this album doing guest spots, including:  Mary J. Blige,    Jay Z,  Elephant Man, Fabolous, R. Kelly  (I hate  R. Kelly . LOL)  Monica, Beenie Man, Nelly,  and  The Clark Sisters.   These are the ultimate anthems for any club going bigger woman like me. Anything to psyche me up before I see the teensy trollops in their cummerbunds (A.K.A. miniskirts) or Paris Hilton wannabe skirts, and midriff bearing tops, the songs that makes me feel GOOD about my body before I head on out the door, although Missy has several that get me psyched. It helps along with a few bottles of false confidence, otherwise known as Smirnoff Ice.  But the one that works best for the club is called  "Pump It Up."  The lyrics can be found  urlLink here .   (As an aside, this lyrics web site, is by far, the most accurate for a Hip Hop songs I've ever seen online. Well done. )

						   There's nothing like seeing a prick get fucked over.  It's the human&nbsp;mentality that when people see people in higher power (or a supposed higher power)&nbsp;struggle, or somehow face difficulties in something,&nbsp;they feel a little bit (or a lot, depending.) of joy inside.   I know. Savage kicks.  But&nbsp;I never said&nbsp;I was nice.   Its like working for someone, who is a   total Asshole . &nbsp;&nbsp;Who's harassed and tortured people at work merely because he is a supervisor and has the authority, for years, and then find out he's been diagnosed with   rectal cancer.     Its actually a proper usage of the word irony.&nbsp;  And though&nbsp;I find sympathy in his situation,&nbsp;I&nbsp;still think it's damned funny.&nbsp;

						   Remind me never to write at&nbsp;5 AM again. Jesus. It's not like it did a lick of good anyways.  A new CD review is in order, to balance out the scales... Or some shit. Or maybe just because&nbsp;I feel like it.  Okay, okay, it's not technically new. It's from a few years ago. BUT, it might be new to you. So here goes.   Goldmember Soundtrack (Various Artists, 2002)   &nbsp; It's mostly remakes of funk and 60's tunes done by modern artists, and some new ones tossed into the lot.

						   I'm watching&nbsp;the sun rise from the&nbsp;balcony, over the mountains, and it's beautiful.  But it doesn't move me like it used to.  I can't sleep.  I was tired earlier in the morning, but honestly, the thought of crawling into my bed, alone,  AGAIN , isn't that terribly intreguing. Life was a lot simpler when&nbsp;I wasn't alone.   Or was it?  I can't tell anymore.&nbsp;When I wasn't wondering what the fuck was going on in my love life when&nbsp;it was&nbsp;simple.   Or was it ever simple?  When I'm dating around, feeling heartless. Feeling like&nbsp;I'm leading people on. Even though I'm&nbsp;completely honest.&nbsp;And I'm so torn inside.   I feel like a bad person.   I feel bad for having emotions.   I've been smoking too much, my chest hurts. &nbsp;And thinking too much, because my head hurts too.  I feel bad for freaking him out. And I'm sorry I did, or even if&nbsp;I did. I'm sorry if a drunken&nbsp;phone call at midnight my time, made him feel pressured, or&nbsp;whatever the fuck else it did. &nbsp;But I don't know if that's the reason why&nbsp;either.  I miss Him.  More than I let show.&nbsp;  I miss his voice. I miss the conversations we used to have. I miss laughing at his jokes, or him laughing at mine. I miss him waking me up at 12:45 AM when I'm up at 5 AM and it   doesn't fucking matter   because it's&nbsp;  him   on his way home with a phone call.&nbsp; And he has my heart.  I would always pick up the phone  if&nbsp;I&nbsp;was able to,&nbsp;for him.  Fuck...  I was angry on my way home this morning. Angry, and miserable inside.&nbsp;When you can't stop the tears when your on public transit at 1 AM kind of miserable.&nbsp; Angry, miserable and questioning everything&nbsp;I was feeling.&nbsp; And I didn't care. Let them see me cry. Let them think&nbsp;I was drunk, or nuts, or a combination of both, if it suits them. I still don't care. I wasn't any of those things anyways.  The sun is up.  It's another stunning morning. &nbsp;  I'm going to go to sleep.   Or&nbsp;try at least.

						   Okay, to understand that title you would have to see the newest stand up routine done by  Margaret Cho , entitled  "Notorious C.H.O." &nbsp;   By FAR the funniest damned stand up I've EVER seen, absolutely racy in content, she comments on everything from homosexuality, to&nbsp;her period&nbsp;(And how straight men would sound if they had theirs) to&nbsp;her routine on "Pussy."&nbsp;I laughed so hard, my head hurt. (Not to mention my ribs, and&nbsp;I think my cheeks took a serious workout.)  Thank you Ryan, for introducing me to the depths of Margaret's depravity. She's one fucking funny Korean woman. Her impressions of her mother, are hysterical. I would borrow the DVD from him, but I think he watches the thing&nbsp;religiously. Highly recommended by myself, and Ryan as well. I actually think its going to be the next DVD&nbsp;I purchase.   Just a short entry for tonight. It's been a long day.

						   Here are&nbsp;the lyrics to the most recent  Avril Lavigne  song playing on the radio,&nbsp;  urlLink  "My Happy Ending"       I dig the words. The tune is&nbsp;pretty good&nbsp;as well.   She's the new  Alanis Morrisette , In my humble opinion.&nbsp; How a sixteen year old girl learns the intricacies of adult relationships, well, that's up to the people that write her lyrics for her, or at least help her by handing her the Grown-up Coles Notes version of romance, or lack thereof.   I actually stumbled upon her stuff&nbsp;before she became&nbsp;big,&nbsp;one day when&nbsp;I was in the MSN chat rooms before you had to pay for them. (Whatever they sucked anyways, no big loss.) Her band members were pimping&nbsp;her music, in particular the tune  "Complicated" &nbsp;in the Canada chats.   I thought her&nbsp;tunes was alright when&nbsp;I checked out her website a few years ago, but&nbsp;I still don't like her rendition of  "Knocking on Heaven's door."    Hey, whatever works right?&nbsp; I guess it worked just fine.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;I swear if&nbsp;I see another teeny bopper trying to be "original,"&nbsp;walking around wearing a blue and red striped tie with a wife beater on, I'm going to scream. All of the sudden, everyone was&nbsp;being "different,"&nbsp;Punk rock was hip, and my ex-boyfriend Erik's clothes were trendy again. Kudo's to sticking to your fashionista guns,  urlLink Erik . No one pulls off red and blue plaid multi-zippered bell bottoms like you do and can actually make it look hot.   To each their&nbsp;own.   *As an aside.&nbsp;I haven't listened to Z95.3 in ages, but put it on because my discman ran out of juice.&nbsp;The station&nbsp;hasn't improved much. I remember why&nbsp;I switched my alarm clock to Rock 101.1. I think I've heard the same artists three times&nbsp;in the&nbsp;past two hours.&nbsp; Or maybe they all just sound the same now. (Oh Gawd.&nbsp;I'm starting to&nbsp;sound like my Dad.)*

						   I'm in this fucked up exceedingly goofy sorta spaced out mood right now. It's somewhat melencholy. &nbsp; I've had the laziest day in ages. It's my vacation,&nbsp;I feel exceedingly bummy. And as&nbsp;I was trying to explain to Liz on MSN, guilty for it. Stupid&nbsp;I know. both of us agree. Actually Tory agrees too. That makes three. (Momma, and Me, and Baby make three...)&nbsp; Maybe its because I've gone so long having so much to do at once, that I'm completely unused to doing nothing. Gawd.  &nbsp; My music lately still seems to be Love Inc. Mmmmm throbbing techno beats. &nbsp; I've been thinking about what&nbsp;I want relationship wise in the past few days. I want one person. He's too busy for me at the moment, so I've been dating around. They only seem to want sex. I dont want a relationship with anyone else.&nbsp;And quite frankly, sex&nbsp;with someone you dont care about isn't nearly as satisfying as sex with someone you do&nbsp;care about.&nbsp;It's actually quite depressing. The human obsession with sex is highly amusing, and understandable. People are sexual creatures, and I'm a highly sexual person too. But its not the end all and be all of civilization.  &nbsp; M'eh. &nbsp; Truth be told, I'm highly uninterested in dating students. Or even men my age be it slightly older or younger. I'm not interested in dating people in unstable careers. people that&nbsp;can't hold a job longer than four months,&nbsp;Or even have careers that lead no where. I'm not interested in dating men that play videogames incessantly, or get savage kicks out of violence,&nbsp;or immaturity. (However, It's alright once in a while for the immaturity.) I once had a BF that told me that&nbsp;I was incredibly mature, for my age.&nbsp;I'm much older in my head,&nbsp;than the number it proclaims on my Birth Certificate. &nbsp; Well, you deal with 4 years of abuse in your first relationship,&nbsp; have a fairly horrific incident of sexual abuse happen to you from someone you trusted implicitly when your thirteen, and you tend to mature a lot faster. Not to mention that I didnt have siblings, and grew up around adults. &nbsp; &nbsp; Call me shallow if you will, or picky, or a&nbsp;bitch. I&nbsp;know what&nbsp;I want,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;want instability. I may not like my job that much, even though things are turning around, (And they are offering apprenticeships now)&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I've been there for four years. Thats a lot more than most people can say. &nbsp; On the same note, I'm sure I've excluded myself from people based on my personality,&nbsp;I can be negative sometimes, I can be whiny about my situation. I'm just sick of the SHIT that goes around.  &nbsp; To be quite blunt, I'm more than my pussy.  &nbsp; All&nbsp;I want, is someone to love and to love me&nbsp;for me, and for me to&nbsp;never doubt it.  To have a sense of maturity and purpose that propels them forward in life.  To have intelligence that makes them joyful to be around, to banter with.&nbsp;I might be greedy with my requirements in a relationship, but honestly, all&nbsp;I want in a relationship is affection and quality time. I'm quite happy living in a&nbsp;shitty apartment on the harsh side of town,&nbsp;with someone&nbsp;I mutually adore, than in a mansion with&nbsp; someone&nbsp;I can tolerate.&nbsp; I want someone I can spoil with love, that would do the same to me, all the while respecting self, identity and personal space. &nbsp; This is&nbsp;are the qualities&nbsp;I see and the&nbsp;reason why I'm waiting for Devin. He might not see it, He probably wouldnt agree with me either.&nbsp;But&nbsp;I can.&nbsp;I've never really publicly proclaimed it before this. But all the people that know me know the reasons why I care about him. It's something that leaves me grinding my teeth in frustration. I can't be there to support him when he is in need, and he's not here when&nbsp;I need a shoulder to cry on. Some might call it stupid, but the people I care about, and that care about me in return, don't. (At least not to my face, and if they did,&nbsp;I couldn't&nbsp;begrudge them. I wonder sometimes, myself. But&nbsp;I stick to my guns.)&nbsp;That's how you can test the true value of a friend. When they stick by a friend that might have made a mistake.  &nbsp; You can't help falling in love. It just happens. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

						   Apparently there is a severe heat wave that should be hitting Vancouver come Thursday. Brutally hot in the Interior (upwards of mid to high forties Celsius) and getting up there in the Lower Mainland itself. (Up to the lower thirties Celsius.) &nbsp; Yikes.  &nbsp; That, combined with electrical storms in the heavily wooded interior of BC,&nbsp;My spidey senses are tingling, telling me&nbsp;there will probably be a repeat performance of last summer's fire storms&nbsp;up north. No fun.  &nbsp;  Time to turn on the A/C kids.&nbsp;Not to mention crossing your fingers.&nbsp;

						   In the process of moving, I acquired a new queen sized bed, and sent my old double to the curbside.     This new bed, is dangerously addictive. (Thank-You SO much Tiana!)     It's soft, and HUGE, much bigger than im used to, and I think I'm in peril of sleeping there all damned day. All I need now is a cuddly bedmate, to waste away those hours of daylight.     I'm a nocturnal gal by nature, and what better choice for a career at this moment in time than working in a bakery where I get up at 5 AM. I'm notoriously grumbly until about 7 AM, which truthfully, makes me feel bad for the mixer when I walk into the shop in the morning and when he cheerfully greets me with "Gooood morning! How are you doing today Linds?" and I respond with the typical "Tired." Or even more eloquent, "Mmmmphhh."     Somehow, my male Co-workers, have accepted the fact that I don't talk, at least not for the first hour of my shift, and the same usually goes for at home, I'm quiet for the first few hours of waking up, usually choosing to write in here,  and after a while of my brain chilling out in first gear, I kick it up to second. The unfortunate souls that hope to have an actual conversation with me on Yahoo or MSN when I first wake up, well, You're going to get the one word replies too... Sorry about that.     I don't usually drink coffee to wake up, for some strange reason. To be honest, we don't even have a coffee maker in our apartment. None of my apartments ever have. I was used to having my Mornings staggered all over the place for school at first, and then shiftwork after that. I mean, some of my shifts at work started at 4 AM, which was brutal. Toss in a few 6 AM starts and a 9 AM start, and your body clock is all over the place. Thankfully, I've learned to sleep at any time of day, for any length of time.  And I still can.     On a side note, Liz and I managed to have the whole Apartment's worth of stuff moved up here on Friday afternoon and Saturday during the day. A special shout out for Steve, and Sean who did the heavy lifting, (Yes, you manly men you.) To my Dad, who helped me get my bed on Thursday, to Pete Marsz from work who scored us a gorgeous living room table for only ten bucks, Crystal for giving me the much anticipated bookshelf, Liz's folks for scoring us the free chairs for the balcony, living room, and dining area, and McCluckers who managed to harass me the whole time He was there on Saturday, when we were finishing up,  joking how every piece of plastic on the floor was a condom wrapper, and all of my books, were pornographic.  (And FYI, not all of them are. Just some. :P) Hey man, at least my favourite position isn't horizontal on the floor. (It's horizontal on the bed.)      The house warming party still hasn't been decided yet, but all who are invited will get a shout out, when we've decided to hold the thing.     Cheers! I'm gonna go load up my new bookshelf, and stay away from that bed until tonight.

						   Sadly as of yet, I haven't had any time to myself.   The first three days so far have been moving, albeit with a brief hiatus to spend some time at Crystal's place for a Barbeque. I hadn't seen some of these people in years. Literally. Some of them were very good friends during highschool, some of them were Crystal's exes, and they're acquaintances.   Both Crystal and myself have a good track record for maintaining a friendship with ex bf's after we've split up.   It was phenomenal to see these people again. I hadn't seen Duffy since I graduated high school six years ago. (minus a few passing drive by's) He didn't know how to word it properly, He was worried that he would offend me. I mean how do you tell someone that has lost 120 pounds since the last time you saw them, that they aren't huge anymore? Simple.   You just tell them.   Trust me, you'll get the biggest smile on their face. I know I grinned from ear to ear, when he told me I looked absolutely amazing.   I really want some time ALONE. I am a private person, unless I'm around my partner, and I require my own space on a regular basis. It feels like my whole Vacation so far has been tugged and tossed around, really to no one's fault, but I honestly, just wanted to write, and read, and swim, go tanning, and stuff like that, where I don't have to think, just be there and relax.   Truthfully, I wanted someone in particular up here, for his vacation, to pamper the hell out of him, but a car accident prevented him from coming up here. So I decided to make due with reading, swimming, dance and archery. It's not nearly as satisfying. I'll figure it out somehow... Maybe He can come up here for my next vacation in September. Who knows. It would be nice.   Monday, was going to be Karaoke at the Roxy, by special request to Mizz Liz from me. I haven't been there in a month and a half or so. I was looking forward to it, but apparently it was cancelled for this week. (As an aside, anyone that has heard me do Karaoke, suggestions are always welcome for my song entries.)   Anyways. Enough whining.   I need to eat some food.   Ciao kids.

						   I've been listening to a few CD's slapped into my discman tucked into my shorts while packing, moving and otherwise feeling like one of the most disorganized people on the planet. Our apartment is in total chaos, and split between two locations.   Lets put it this way. Breakfast today, consisted of a Bounty chocolate bar.    1.  Much Dance 90's     (2 disc set)     (MuchMusic Compilation,  Various Artists,   2003, Sony Music)    Okay, okay, have I dated myself enough? Yes, yes I have. It's all the dance music hits from when I was in early highschool, but it fucking rocks. I mean,  "Ice Ice Baby"   by  Vanilla Ice?!  (I can actually rap the whole damned thing. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I just know I can.) Or  "Mr. Vain?!"  Or  "Hip Hop Hooray"  by  Naughty by Nature?!  I have to love a song with the line, "She's as hot as a baker, 'cuz we're Naughty by Nature." Seriously! Awesome.   I mean, how dorky am I, when my cell phone ringer right now is  "Bust A Move"  by  Young MC . (That, or  "Safety Dance"  by  Men without Hats , or  "Hey-Ya"  by  Outkast .)    2.  Pulp Fiction Soundtrack    (Various Artists)    Old movie. Older music. Classic Motown, Funk. Gorgeous. As much personality as Quentin Tarantino puts into his character dialogue, I usually skip past the talking parts. This is the CD I first heard  "Son of A Preacher"  by  Dusty Springfield  on, about 10 years ago, that I do at Karaoke, which has earned me the title of "Mizz Motown." (That, and  "Respect"  by  Aretha Franklin. )    3.  Great Big Sea, "Up"    (Warner Music, 1995)      Good ol' Newfie tunes. Classic Canadiana. And it reminds me of my Grandpa. Fun to belt along with, Fun to bounce around the apartment to, and even more fun to drink to at the  Blarney Stone.     4.  Be What You Are.    (Various Artists)    A Christmas present from Devin. Some great tunes. Check out  urlLink his Blog ,  he's got a listing of what's on there in the " urlLink Be What You Are " link. Or, just click that one right there cuz' I had to do some searching to find it.    5.  Madonna, Greatest hits, Volume 2.    (Maverick Recording Company, 2001)   Mostly Madge's new stuff, but the GOOD new stuff. I'm a big Madonna fan, I blame my mother for that. Even if I can't sing  "Like a Virgin"  at Karaoke with a straight face. (Touched for the very first time! *Hah!* First time?! Oh, like a vir-er-er-er-gin....)     It has my all time Fave madonna song,  "Music."  It usually makes me ride the barstool at the club one hand gripping the seat between my thighs like a pommel, and one circling over my head with an imaginary lasso in slow motion. Yeah. It's a hot song.    6.  Massive 2002    (Various Artists)    A collection of dance/trance/hip-hop/pop on one cd that I borrowed from Crystal D. Has everything on it from  "Sandstorm" by Darude , to a remake of  "Ordinary World" by Duran Duran  but sung by a woman, some dance versions of Salsa tunes, and the song  "The Summer."  (I don't know who does that one, but I LOVE it.) This was the CD that we popped into her CD player in her Ford Escort Z2X, and zipped about Vancouver in two summers in a row. It Rawks.   Good songs to move by.   You can dance, you can dance. Everybody take off your pants... (And yeah, I know the lyrics arent actually that. It's just way funnier that way.)

						   On the bus on the way down Kingsway, I happen to notice a Japanese Karaoke Bar sign. (Only the word Karaoke was in English.) Sitting on top of the sign were two crows cawing at each other... Fitting?   Anyways, It made me laugh.

						     What was...      1. Your First Grade teachers name?    Mrs. Yamamoto. A wee little stocky Japanese lady, that was completely obsessive over the Vancouver Canucks (ah that Canadian obsession with hockey...) She blew up a balloon every day and if it was your birthday on that day, you got to pop it.&nbsp;  (I honestly don't remember what happened when it wasn't someones birthday.)    2. Your Favourite Saturday morning cartoon?    It was usually The Bugs Bunny Show. When I was living with my parents, I still watched it with my Mom and Dad. Granted it's on a 36 inch flatscreen now, but the laughter is still the same. I can watch the really old ones over and over again.    3. The name of your Very First Best Friend?    That's simple. Elizabeth. I've known her since I was five years old. We split ways in grade nine, hooked up again about a year or so ago, and now we're room mates.   Apparently,&nbsp;I was married at the age of three by my father, to the next door neighbor's son. I can't even remember his name at the moment. It'll come to me.  (It's Michael. It only took me six days to remember it, but&nbsp;I did...)    There was also Aiden Varga. I think he was the first boy I ever fell in love with. He moved up north to Shushwap. I miss him. I miss a lot of my friends that moved away. I never really forget them.   My other "Best Friends" (If we're going chronologically) are Ryan (who used to be my nemesis) Crystal, who I met in math class in grade 10, and Crystal D. Who I met in Social studies&nbsp;11 (I believe.)   Because I'm an only child, these people are my&nbsp;brother and sisters. They're as close to family as you can get. I would do anything for them. They know it.    4. My favourite breakfast cereal?    Honeycomb. Honeycomb?&nbsp;I Love Honeycomb!&nbsp;    5. My favourite thing to do after school?    Well. I was never really involved in anything regarding after school activities as a child, I was&nbsp;very reticent, quiet, and shy. I was the fat girl with glasses, and other than Aiden and Elizabeth, I didn't really have many friends in Elementary school.   I read a lot of books. Repeatedly. From all genre's, but I usually preferred Science Fiction and Fantasy.   After I was old enough to be independent, I threw myself into choir and theatre. four days a week, my school days started at 7 AM, and finished at 7:30 PM. My passions are the arts.

						   And I SHOULD be sedated. Whoo. One more day of work, just one more stinkin' shift, and I'm off work for TEN glorious days. What the hell am I going to do with ten days of leisure?   Well...  My first day of holidays, I was supposed to go to a First-Aid class, but now work isn't sure if I was even accepted to go. If that's the case, that sucks royally, because I've been screwed twice then for the same thing that has been offered through work. AND I was really looking forward to giving that dummy mouth to mouth. Darn. In the evening, it's a Union meeting. Has work related stuff  ENDED YET  ?   Apparently so.  Tomorrow, after my last shift before vacation, and Thursday during the day, are moving days. However, Liz and I have been shuffling some stuff over to the new apartment starting last night, and tonight is the bathroom, and kitchen shite. The rest should follow relatively easily. Well, except for the furniture and beds etc. Those are going to be a pain in the ass. Friday, is making sure we got all of our shit together, and unpacking the joint. (For me, anyways.) And I plan on attending Liz's Karaoke at the Duff, and actually being able to stay there 'til  closing. Wow.    Saturday, I've been invited to a Barbeque at my girlfriend Crystal's place, it should be fun, I get to see some people I haven't seen in years, that I went to highschool, and were fairly well acquainted with and there will be burgers, and the booze shall flow freely. I'm anticipating it with some regard. Giddyup!   LOL, apparently my elementary school/High school crush is going to be there as far as Crystal knows. He's also her ex-boyfriend. That should be interesting to say the least.  My Holiday should include copious amounts of sleeping in and perhaps some imbibing of alcohol and straining of vocal chords at Karaoke. not to mention, swimming, reading, at least one medieval dance class, and I  STILL  haven't attended the archery lessons @ BCIT.   Fuck, what a slacker.  Annnnyways. More juicy deets to come at a later time. I need a nap.

						   I've picked up to two CD's lately,   The first one is  Maroon 5 , the album is titled:  "Songs about Jane."   The lead singer has a sort of nasal/whiny voice, thats actually quite sexy (But can't compete with the ex lead singer from Sound Garden and current frontman of Audioslave, a Mr. Chris Cornell, A.K.A. Vocal Sex God.)  but awesome awesome sensual lyrics, the one  titled "Secret" is my particular favourite on this album. The lyrics can be found  urlLink here .  And the second one, is the new  Dido  album,  "Life for Rent."  A particularly poignant song for me right now is one titled "Have a Little Time" The lyrics can be found  urlLink here .  Happy Listening. I dig em lots.

						   Today I was up at 5 AM to be at work at 6, I spent the morning frying doughnuts. It's not my favourite job to say the least. It actually started off pretty shitty, and I thought it was going to continue that way. Not to mention that I had the theme song from "SpongeBob Squarepants" running incessantly through my head.  *He lives in a pineapple under The Sea... (SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS!) Aarrrgh! Get it out!  Get it out! *  And I don't even watch television, Fer fucks sake.  Oh Linds. You are   SO   wrong. This is NOT going to be a bad day.  My boss, was in an unusual mood. He was  nice . It almost made me wonder if I was going to get written up for some misdemeanor that I wasn't aware I had committed.  He had to cut some hours, and I had agreed to go home early. After four hours. He was joking around, and teasing me, which I STILL don't quite know how to deal with, but lightly bantered back with him, trying to not offend him. He was fairly jovial until about 9 AM, When my Assistant Manager asked him where the cake decorator was. (Apparently, when you have the option of going store to store to do the jobs that cover other people while they are on vacation and have days off, you also have the option to not show up.) A bit of a panic ensued, and I thought  "Oh here we go... This is how it's supposed to be in here."  Nope.  He comes up to me and asks me how well I can decorate. (He's dangled this particular carrot in front of my nose before, teasing me with the idea of decorating and then saying "No, sorry. We can't let you do that right now.") I told him, again, that I had had lots of training in my old store, with basic techniques, He took that to heart. I spent the rest of my shift prepping (or base icing) cakes, and doing some decorating next to the Bakery Assistant Manager, and ended up staying my full shift. I even got the boss coming up to me, patting me on the shoulder and saying "Good job, kiddo." (Gee, thanks Gramps.) at the end of my shift. I almost fainted from receiving actual praise from him, I didn't, however, but managed to nearly split my head in two with my grin.  On a whim I decided to go swimming after work, finally breaking in that 11 free swims pass that I got from my First Boyfriend's Mom, four years ago for my 20th birthday. I had forgotten how tiring it was, and also, how awesome, and relaxing it is to immerse yourself completely in water. My muscles have that lovely dull, warm, achy feeling you get from working them. Considering I did about 35 laps in one of the swim lanes, played around in the water, and relaxed my lower back in the whirlpool. All in an hour and twenty minutes or so. It's definitely rekindled my love affair with the twelve feet deep end in a pool of chlorinated water. I'm planning on going at least three or four times on my vacation.  So, back from Bonsor, and I stop by my Apartment Managers suite, to talk to her about the new apartment that Elizabeth and I are moving into on the 15th. She takes me upstairs, I hand her the cheque, she hands me the keys, we chat for a bit, and then she leaves. And I look around at this  HUGE, SPACIOUS, CORNER SUITE, TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT.  With new Linoleum, fairly new carpets, SCREENS on the sliding doors, (not to mention a sliding door that doesn't sound like your slaughtering a dozen alleycats when you open the damned thing) I think I almost had an orgasm. It sure beats the hell out of a cramped one bedroom that Elizabeth and I have been sharing for six months or so.   Design ideas are racing through my head. I'm walking from room to room, and my head is spinning. The view is  PHENOMENAL!  I can see the mountains, We're on the Third floor, away from the ghetto apartment building across the alley, that was our previous view, Away from the giant, divebombing moths, and, ANNNNNND! I have a dimmer switch for my bedroom light. Yeeeah.

						   Recently, I did a scan of my Yahoo Messenger list. Sorting out my contacts of people I talk to regularily, and people that I haven't talked to in ages.   As a regular chat junkie on Yahoo chats, I get people adding me all the time, for various reasons: to either: Jerk off to my Webcam whilst I am unknowing of whats going on, adding me with hopes of getting a date or laid by me, they see my profile on the Yahoo Members Directory and click to add me because I have one thing in common in my hobbies or interests, or they Like my picture, or a combination of all the above, OR the rare few that actually find my conversations with them amusing.   Out of the One Hundred and Fifty contacts I have on my list, I sorted them out into two categories, "Close friends," which contains 28 people, and all the rest got stuck into a category called "friends."   It was getting to the point that when I logged onto Yahoo messenger, I was SWAMPED with about 20 IM's from people not even ten seconds after logging on. Half of them I had already put on ignore, either because they were graphically sexual, rude, or abrasive, that or they didn't even have basic english skills. I'm a patient person, but if I can't understand you, and your asking for my first name ten seconds into the conversation, or to see my tits,(or a multitude of other various body parts) I'm sorry but you're put on ignore. Immediately. No dice. I don't play that way. However, seeing as Yahoo Messenger ignore lists only hold 100 people, I'm pretty much shit outta luck when I've clicked them and my list is full.  I've gone and changed my Yahoo ID, and E-mail accounts a few times during the past eight years I've been on chats, because some people tend to associate me with negative things. or expect things of me that im not willing to accomodate. (As in Nudity on cam, or Head games, or whatever else strikes they're fancy.)Some people are pretty fucked up. Lord Jeebus bless Yahoo for making the newest version of Yahoo Messenger, where you can change "Stealth settings."  My MSN list is approaching 65 people, and a few of these people are on block as well.   So this is a shout out, to all the people that actually SEE me online, you're in the "IN" crowd. You are the people I enjoy talking to. You're the decent, intelligent, witty crew I love to chat with. Thank-you. Thank-you for not being pigs. Thank-you for not expecting things of me that some people would take for granted. And if I do happen to get lonely another Valentines Day night by myself, and drink another half a mini mickey of Fireball in twenty minutes and get trashed alone, (Not that it happens often.) Maybe you WILL get to see my tits.   Maybe. But dont count on it. *Smirks*

						   A synopsis of Today:  7 AM: I wake up. Apparently my body clock doesn't let me sleep past this time anymore. I'm lucky if I get to sleep in till past 9 AM. I mess around the apartment, killing time, check my email and respond to any of my business stuff, chat on Yahoo for a while, and then get my butt in gear, hop in the tub, get all squeaky clean. I do my makeup and plan on getting a hair cut, because it's getting rather Mullet like and takes half my available product to do what I want it to do. And damnit, that's not cool. If I was a man, I would definitely be a Metrosexual.  10 AM: Head out the door, and make a pit stop at my Mailbox, and Huzzah! my GST cheque. Nice, nice. Back upstairs to drop off the rest of the mail, and then down the stairs to head off to MetroTown. That place should be called MetroHell. I can't believe the thing is packed at Ten thirty in the morning, on a Thursday. Don't people work or something? (Just a tidbit of information, its the Second largest Mall in Canada, dwarfed only by West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton.   Of all the crazy places!  )  11:30 AM: by this time, I've bought myself a purse, wallet and shoes. Gawd. I'm a shopping whore. someone give me an IV drip, or the Shopping patch. But, please, make sure it matches my new shoes and purse.  I'm starving, so it's off to the food court. Which has moved. But apparently I can watch a video of the subsequent destruction of the former food court. Not too terribly fascinating. There are no half naked construction workers in there. Actually, there are no people in there at all. Thusly no point in me watching the T.V.   And anyways, I'm hungry.   I go on this wild food court hunt, following signs on the floor, almost walking into people, trying to figure out where the fuck they've put this thing. On the way, I book an appointment at the hair salon, with a rather brusque hairstylist. I fear for my magnificent Glamazon locks, but book the appointment anyways. I'm not about to pay 50 bucks at the other place to get a friggin haircut. I eat, I go back, after phoning Ryan with a harrassing phone call to "Get the fuck out of bed." of which he responded with grunts and groans attempting to be words. I tell him I'm going to bother him when I'm done getting my hair chopped.  12:15 PM: Okay, here we go. Cut it off. Every mullet-like inch. She doesn't listen to a word I've said to her, but it still looks good. Thanks Colleen. Try working on customer relations. Ryan calls it my Butch-Dyke cut. Gosh. I'm happy now. Who's You're Daddy? (Uhm....You are Linds?) Ryan is speaking legibly now. He's on his way to Lougheed, and I'm on the Skytrain, headed to ANOTHER mall.  1 PM: Meet Ryan. Drink coffee. get told I look "Faaaaaaabulous." Trade insults with him and finish each others sentences for about 20 minutes. Buy bathroom stuff, and mosey on around the mall. We drop all my shit off at home, and GO BACK to Metrotown. Frig. By now, I hate the mall.   2:30 PM: We hit the bank, and then go through the Crystal Mall. Basically it's Chinatown in concentrated form. Ryan prices out some stuff for his computer that all sounds greek to me. I just stand there and look pretty. We trade insults some more and finish some more of each other's sentences. We go eat some food and I watch Ry ogle guys, occasionally commenting on my own sightings.   5 pm: Ryan and I split ways, I head home and die exhausted on my shiny new computer/deck chair. It doesn't break. Hallejulah. Praise Jeebus.  8 pm: Start doing laundry, and on the way back up to my apartment from the basement, not even five minutes after I've used the elevator, I find out that some poor lady is trapped in it between floors one and two. Jeeeeeeesus. NO thank you. I hate elevators. Techs are on the way. Poor thing.  I bet she'll take the stairs from now on though.

						   I Spent my evening and a large portion of my first day off this week sleeping. And I'm not joking... I slept for 18 hours. From 3pm in the afternoon on Monday, to 10:30am this morning. It's a completely disgusting waste of time, that I could have been out doing something during. Can't I just sleep when I'm dead or something? Honestly... I guess I needed it. I think I've come down with that annoying little cold buzzing about the city that makes you really tired and gives you the sniffles. Either that or I have mono. Which isn't really possible, considering the amount of action I've been getting lately. I think it's definitely the first option.   I missed dance class, which is slightly disappointing, and had three friends call to have me pick up the phone groggy and sounding like a six year old on the phone. Apparently I sound cute and sweet when people wake me up. (Crystal says she actually feels BAD for waking me up when I sound like that.) Too bad I'm not always cute and sweet. The thing my close friends don't realize, is that I have no problem picking up the phone at any time of day or night if they need to talk. I have call display, and if it's a number I don't recognize, they can leave me a message. Other than that, I pick up the phone. It's not like I turn the damned thing off anyways.  Perhaps the reason I've been so tired, is because I've been working production at work for the last month and it's probably the most physically exhausting work I've ever done. It's immensely satisfying, but we're so short-handed in the bakeries lately, that it's a two bakers, or a baker and a "Bakers Helper"(that's my position, BTW. Basically I do all the shit they do, and all the shit they think they are too good to do, for half the wages.) doing the entire production for the next day. In most jobs you get "downtime." in otherwords five or ten minutes of standing or sitting around in between tasks. I don't. I'm moving from six am to one pm, with two fifteen minute breaks. It's okay tho. Like I said. It's satisfying work.  AND , my boss is starting to see that I do have the skills at work, now that he gives me the chance to show him. And quite frankly, it's the most satisfying part of the whole thing. But to be honest, it was very difficult on my body for the first week and half. I think I did break down crying at one point because I felt so exhausted. I recall telling my Manager, on a day that he was ragging on me particularly viciously, that "I couldn't take it anymore, and the first chance I got to get out of there I was taking." He told me I was too smart to stick around in that job anyways. Which is sort of a back-handed compliment from him,(You would have to know him. I swear the first six months I was working with him, he was trying to get rid of me. Whatever, I don't think he realizes quite how stubborn I am. I'm a VERY typical Taurus female.) I got over that feeling of uselessness quickly enough.  I spent the afternoon reading the third book in a trilogy that I've already read before. (Kushiel's Chosen, by Jacqueline Carey.) and happily chilling out on the couch. The television has been on a grand total of once while Lizzie-B has been house sitting, and that was only to see my buddy Murray (the Murr-man aka.  Pookie ) on CBC news for some funky thing they were somehow using to relate to the election last week about karaoke and the similarities with voting. (However the fuck that works.) I tend to chat online as my relaxation after work or do a blog entry, and Lizzie tends to watch the T.V. Whatever rings your bell, eh?  I've been listening to Love Inc. On my way to work, Its older Montreal based techno/dance music, as my co-worker Erica described it "Oh! That's Old School." Fuck. It's only from 8 years ago. Jeez, did that ever make me feel old. My favourite track is #9, which as far as I know, since I lost the cover ages ago is called "C'est Fantastique." It's the same chick that sings the rest of the tracks on the CD with DJ Chris Sheppard, but she's speaking in French in parts of it. Some moans and giggles in it that sound quite orgasmic, and the lyrics loosely translated are about how: "She's listening to the music, the music makes her body tremble, it's fantastic." Not terribly heavy content wise, but timeless beats. (y'know how some tunes are VERY dated? Not this stuff.) All in all, I wouldn't have it in my discman, if I didn't dig it.

						   Today, as I finished posting my latest entry, I was in a rush to get out of my apartment. A girlfriend was waiting outside to hang out and chat with me at the Laundromat whilst she washed her unmentionables. (I also ran into my cousin and his girlfriend there, and a girl I used to go to elementary school with. I haven't seen her since grade seven or so. She looks pretty much the same, but I don't anymore. I look better. *winks*)  Y'know how you get off of a chair? You sorta push yourself up with your hands on the arm rests? Yeah... Well, my comp chair is one of those funky collapsible lawn chairs with a beer holder on the side. I push myself up, and boom. I'm on my arse. Whee, fun. Like I said before, I've got moments of brilliance that over shadow the klutzy-ness that is me. I think I inherited that particular gene from my Mother. Ah well. I love the woman regardless. She's a great person.  Gawd.  The "bolt" (It's actually a feeble little chintzy aluminum pin) holding the corner of the seat to the arm rest, snaps in half. Not terribly surprising since I lounge and sprawl all over the fucking thing. It's one of my favourite chairs. Needless to say, it was brought back to the store I got it at about an hour later, and exchanged. Lets see how long this one lasts. (And if it does break again, no biggie. I can always exchange it again.)  I swear I'm going to die young, from tripping off of something accidentally. Or, breaking my neck tripping on a flat, low pile wall to wall carpet in the hallway. Laugh all you want. I've actually done it. Much to my friend Crystal's amusement. I still get teased by her.  Maybe I should have gone to school in the little yellow bus, and eaten my food with a fork with a cork on the tines. Bugger.

						   Yeah...   So I was updating my profile here, and I was thinking what the Hell, Might as well play around with the random question feature that they ask you on this. WHO the fuck thinks up these questions? Some of them I have to say... Are REALLY messed up. They're very creative. But strange. Some of them are the require the most simple answers imaginable. For instance, If your tongue became a magnet, what would you use for cutlery? Well duh... Plastic cutlery. And if you took the little yellow bus to school, all your forks would have corks stuck on the prongs anyways. (And no, I don't know this from personal experience.)A lot of the questions seem geared towards tongues, and cutlery. I think someone has a food fetish. Or just an oral fetish. (OH! BTW, apparently people that chew gum all the time have an Oral fixation... You learn something new everyday.)  Now, I've been meaning to add a picture or dozen on here... Including one on my profile. But for some reason, that I can't fathom, when I try to log in on Hello, it says the page you have selected cannot be displayed. Maybe it's something to do with my firewall. I can get to the part where I send a pic to the bloggerbot, and it tells me to log-in, and once I type all that junk in, it won't let me. It gives me that dreaded error message. It's   UBER   frustrating. If anyone has any answers for me, do tell.   July 1st was Canada Day. I'm not terribly patriotic. I never have been. I'm a piss poor Canadian anyways, I don't even like hockey. I spent the morning working, and the afternoon with one of my best buddies Ryan, scoping out the festivities at Canada Place, and TRYING to find some bloody fire works displays, but no such luck. They stopped holding the fireworks downtown. personally, I think that's a really dumb idea.   My friend Devin celebrated his Birthday on the 3rd, down in Texas. And I'm assuming he's still nursing one fuck of a hangover.  Or, at least I'm hoping he is. Dev has been working way too hard, and totally deserved a good booze binge with his buddies. I just wish I was there, to join in on the mischief... C'est la Vie. I called early Saturday morning, on my coffee break to sing him Happy Birthday in style on his voicemail. I hope He enjoyed it. You should check out his latest work if you appreciate baseball.  urlLink www.dallasbaseballhome.com  its fairly regional, but very well done. Congrats Dev. And Happy Birthday.  My Cuz is leaving for Australia on the 8th,(The lucky bitch) for six months or more, and my family held a going away party for her yesterday as well. I  ate so much food, I could have died, It actually HURT after eating it. Damn my family members are good cooks. I'm no exception. I can cook up a gourmet meal in half an hour, but since I worked a full shift beforehand, I didn't have to contribute. I've got   lots   of leftovers packed in my fridge now. And enough of Auntie Pat's pasta salad to kill someone. Low-carb my ass...  Roomie is still house sitting, and I actually miss her quite a bit, but I'm appreciating my time alone too. and I've been quiet a lil' Miss over here, just chillin, chattin online, reading, sleeping (but not nearly enough) and working my buns off. I've sort of been avoiding going out, to help with my finances, and also to take a break. My Vacation from work is coming up starting on the 15th. I swear, the nicest thing I have ever seen on the work schedule next to my name, is the word   "HOLIDAYS."   Giddyup!  It's been a while since I've had time off. Around my Birthday in early May of last year to be exact. (Well, I had a vacation in early November too, but it wasn't relaxing. I think I came back worse off then when I left. I got dumped the day my vacation started, so I was pretty down the whole time. Thank god for Liz and her consolation.) I think I've earned it.  I realized that I just passed my Fourth anniversary with Safeway on Tuesday, when I was on the phone with Ryan Wednesday evening. He asked me if I still worked for the "Big Red S." Yup, I sure do. I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. It certainly shows I'm not afraid of job commitment. (Maybe I should commit myself for staying there that fucking long. It's a total Fun Factory in there, I tell ya...) I've basically earned the equivalent to an apprenticeship, IF Safeway and the BC Government still had the apprenticeship programmes running. Fuckers. I know for a fact that I would be making about seven dollars more an hour if they were. And because of this epiphany, and the raw spots from the ball and chain around my ankle from working at this particular job, I'm planning on a career change REALLY soon. Perhaps taking Massage therapy at a Theraputic College or something like that. All I know is that I need to get out of this rut. Kneading dough and kneading flesh aren't all that different. And I've never lacked in my massage skills.  Anyways. I'm off. I won't let the door hit my arse on the way out.

						   I've come to the realization a while ago that I needed to get out of Vancouver.  Just for a week or so. Thank Gad for my friend Norm up at 100 mile house. His generosity extended itself above and beyond the call of friendship, to invite me up there for a week. I'm taking him up on the offer. He told me he wants me to relax. I certainly need to get away from all the busy-ness in town, and sit somewhere near the water and read a book or six.  I've taken a "Medical Stress Leave" from work, compensated by Medical Employment Insurance. The drama happening at work (which I'm sorry to say, I haven't posted in here, lets just say it was shitloads...) as well as the emotional wrecking ball which is my relationship status and finances, had finally taken its toll. The doctor actually classified it as "Situational Depression." Where a few months ago I felt "Soul weary" now I feel utterly lost.  Lost in myself, and lost to myself.  I found myself sobbing Wednesday night without anything to stop it. (not crying. I mean serious, heart-wrenching sobbing. I'm sure Tom, my next door neighbor, thought I was dying or something... It wasn't pretty.) I've only ever broken this way one time before, when I was seventeen, working in a factory, and a girl on the line I was controlling the speed on, seemed to have some sort of emotional meltdown. I blamed myself for it at the time, because of the speed I was moving the equipment. Thankfully, I had my Father there to console me.  I called Norm, deciding to try to distract myself. And because he always makes me feel good inside. He did a good job. He got me laughing, and relaxed, and definitely proved his merit as a friend. Not that he had to... But I'm eternally grateful. He might not have known exactly what was going on, and thought of it as a regular, run of the mill phone call, but truthfully, he was the person I thought of when I knew that everyone else would ask too many questions, and he would just chat me up and make me smile and blush. A very worthy conversation in my humble opinion.  Thank-you Norm.  The doctor prescribed me some anti-depressant pills, and also wrote me off of work for a month. They'll get rid of the majority of the depression I've been feeling, and they'll also kill my sex drive.  Quite frankly, maybe that's something I need as well.  One month away from all the bullshit. One month to gather my thoughts, and find myself a little more as a person, and the last two weeks of it are going to be creating an updated resume and finding myself a new choice of occupation. Honestly, I don't get paid enough to deal with the garbage that floats around my work.  I'm not a weak person, but everyone is weak sometimes. Lately everything has been eating away at the foundations underneath me (Not in a good way.) and has left me tottering on the brink. Between sanity and insanity, or maybe just leaving me with the feeling of a complete lack of control with my situation. Being a control freak, that is pushing me past my limits. I'm trying to take Dave's advice and just "Let it go." but it's  so  damned hard.  My memory is shoddy lately, My hands are shaking... Most of the time just a small tremble. However, that is what is scaring me the most. It's never affected me physically like this. Ever. I can't get a full solid night's sleep anymore, I get overwhelmed with anxiety, and I'm taking my frustration out on people that don't deserve it.  My apologies. Seriously. I don't like who I am right now either.  I miss being the person that looked approachable, instead of this woman with a gruff hard exterior, the bravado and bluster hiding this wounded inner being. The last time I felt "happy" was at Spain's fireworks display with Ryan, where I teased the firemen walking about before the show started, sang the "Hari Krishna" tune (you would have to hear it to understand what I'm talking about...) that he and I made up and always jokingly sing when they parade through like so many diapered, salmon-pink clad clowns, and the sight of those huge, shimmering, golden explosions in the sky were so beautiful that I actually had tears in my eyes. Granted, that was only a week and a half ago, but I think someone should be happy more than once in three months.  I really have a hard time having my instability so damned visible to everyone else. So visible that my Boss sees it, and chooses to exploit it.    On another note .  My condolences go out to Devin. We've been through some seriously rough times, but he recently lost a dear family member. As angry as I am over him treating me unfairly, and not giving me closure, he deserves some sympathy over this.  He could even get angry with me, for doing this, but you know what? To hell with it. I'm not doing this to disrespect Darla. I'm doing this to show my respects for someone that led a long life and that obviously meant something to someone that I care about. I would do it for anyone I know. I've been angry with him for weeks, and I have respect for him even if he can't show me the respect that I deserve. I still love him in my own way. I miss him terribly as a friend. If that makes me a fool, or a masochist. Whatever. I don't care anymore. I never really forget the people I loved.  I'm sorry for your loss Devin. I've been in your shoes regarding my grandfather. I still miss him, and it pains me to know that I have a hard time remembering his face and voice now.

						   Well, hey now!  I guess my passion for writing, is paying off. Literally. I was commissioned to do a profile on a website for a Canadian professional comedian who is located in the Vancouver area. Not too shabby. I just wish that when I met him today to get the gist of what he wanted, that I wasn't so damned quiet. I'm always so nervous and shy when I meet someone for the first time. I'll post the link up here when my writing is up and available on his website. I hope he likes what I've done. And hey! I get paid for it!  Sweet.  I'm still sick, but the  SMOKING HOT  doctor at the clinic (Damn, too bad he was married. He's over six feet tall, brunette European. Lucky wife. He was even flirting with me.) prescribed me some antibiotics, and they should be kicking in anytime now. So until then, it's Advil and LOTS of sleep and liquids.  I want to go play doctor and naughty nurse. I even have the outfit, damnit.  As for the weather.  SMOKING HOT  yet again. It's almost unbearable. I usually never complain about heat, being accustomed to working around ovens, but this, is unreal. Elizabeth had the balls to ask me if it was "Hot enough for ya?" Whilst I was roasting in the apartment, after my meeting this afternoon. Yeah. It's hot alright. :P Fat people are making their own gravy, it's that damned hot.  I was teased for getting home so quickly, to which I responded that my pasty-white, French Canadian skin would crisp quite nicely if I stayed out in this sunshine too long.  Hmm. Crispy skin AND gravy? Hell. I'm  Kentucky Fried Chicken   with a side dish.   I picked up a couple of CD's and a DVD on the way to the Doctors, I purchased,  Aretha Franklin   "Best Of Aretha Franklin, The 60's"  (It's  FABULOUS!!!!  )    And also the best of  Big Sugar  entitled  "Hit and Run."  a kickass Canadian band from Ontario as far as I could find.  Reviews on these CD's coming up in the next little while after I've dealt with this writing commission.   The movie I picked up is  "School of Rock"  with  Jack Black . It's a highly enjoyable movie. At least in my perspective. I think the part that I like the most, is the way he teaches the kids the History of Rock 'n Roll.(He teaches them more than just Rock and Roll, however. At least according to the blackboards he's pointing at.) The kids seem to enjoy themselves thoroughly with him. The DVD extras apparently have the lessons available uninterrupted. It's very neat. I plan on sitting down and "edumacating" myself fairly soon.

						   Just looked at my profile for blogger.com, and happened to notice that I've written about 16,577 words in two months. More with this post.  Holy Moses.  That's a lot of typing. Maybe I'm in the wrong field of work.

						   Yeah. It's Strep throat/Tonsillitis. Yippee-fucking-doo-dah.   Cripes.   I get it every year. No matter how many times I beg the Doc to rip the fuckers out, He says I have to get it eight times in a year to get them removed.  Eight times in one year?  I don't think he realizes how much of an inconvenience it is to have Strep, or how expensive it is to get antibiotics. I've developed an allergy to penicillin, so I have to get the secondary substitute for it.(Erythromyacin.) It costs twice as much. And there's also the fact that it bloody  hurts  and leaves you exhausted. Not to mention the time off of work. I left work after an hour today, got home, and died in my bed for a good seven hours.  A Co-worker this morning told me that she had heard that Strep Throat can lead to depression. Now since I've been feeling under the weather emotionally and mentally, I thought maybe the reason that I was more susceptible to getting it, was that I had been feeling depressed lately. Streptococcus is a common virus, highly contagious, and usually hidden in the virus for the common cold. Since quite a few people around me at work, have been suffering from the annoying summer cold floating about, I decided to  urlLink look it up  online. (Scroll up a bit on the link provided to read the beginning of the article from MSN.com.)  I wish I hadn't.  (I always say that, damnit.)   Not only is Strep linked to depression, but also Terets/Tourettes syndrome. So, If I start randomly cursing at inopportune times, and saying ridiculous things,  (Not like I don't say ridiculous things already, but something a little more out of the ordinary I would think...)   Let me know, OK?  Murray was saying he thought I might have Mono, which is associated with streptococcus as well,  (Now, THAT would suck.)  since I was  very  tired for a long, long time a few months ago and it still hits me every now and then. However, I've been sleeping more, so that should help. Y'know, I do recall joking about having it, in a previous post of mine. That could be possible, but I doubt it.  I am  not  a hypochondriac, at least I dont think so, and most of the time would ignore a mild illness, brushing it off as an inconvenience, but I've been feeling under the weather an alarming amount in the past six months. I just hope that Elizabeth doesn't get it. Or anyone else I associate with for that matter.  Anyways. It's off to the Doc's tomorrow, since I slept the majority of today away. I know the boss is going to demand a doctors note, even though I was obviously ill, sweating and feverish and sounding like someone had stuffed a trumpet mute down my throat. Advil is  STILL  a good friend of mine.  Shit, fuck, piss!!!

						   Sick.  Not happy.  Throat, head, body hurts.  Sleep is my friend.  So is Advil. Mmmm drugs.  Losing eloquence.   M'eh.  I'll write more later. Prolly in a few days.

						     Luc  read my blog entry for the blues/jazz CD I made from his music stash, and decided to toss in a few interesting facts about the musicians and songs that were included.   Any of my notes are in  Italics.        “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere”  was written by  Doc Pomus  and I think was originally done with  Dr John.                              B.B. King  has 15 kids, to 15 women.  (Holy shit! It should be Busy Boy King, NOT Blues Boy King.)  As far as I know he was never married. Though I’m not 100% sure on that as it’s been years since I’ve read his book and my memory sucks.  (I disagree with this last statement. Memory is all relative.  I can remember things from when I was three years old and not remember what the hell I had for dinner last night. So there. :P)                               “The Sky is Crying”  done by many blues musicians written by  Elmore James  who influenced as many blues musicians as any. Also one of my favourite early blues musicians.  Stevie's  version is still one of my favourites.  (I concur.)                               “Life Without You”  was one of the songs  Stevie Ray Vaughn  did to prove he was more then just a guitar player. If you liked this one I highly recommend checking out  “Life By The Drop”  if you haven’t already.                              “Peel Me A Grape”  I agree definitely boil me a crab. Come on, why would she ask for a cab? It just wouldn't be right when considering the other lyrics. She would want a limo, a cab wouldn't be good enough.  (Good. I'm glad I'm not going deaf.)                                “They Can’t Take That Away From Me”  It’s a  Gershwin  tune. If you haven’t heard the version by  Ella (Fitzgerald)   and  Louis   (Armstrong)  with  Oscar Peterson  on piano I highly recommend it. Along with any other  Gershwin  tune or anything else  Stach  and  Ella  ever did.  (I actually knew this was a  Gershwin  tune, being that my favourite jazz song         of  all time        , that I'm found belting around the apartment, or work, or on the street for that matter... is  "Summertime"  also a  Gershwin  tune.)                               Dr John.  His Autobiography is one of the weirdest books I’ve ever read. If half of it’s true he’s hands down had the most interesting life I’ve ever heard of. If you ever get the chance to read it, it’s called  “Under a Hoodoo Moon”  I’d lend it to ya but I don’t have it, been trying to find it for years but every time I find it they want at least $50 for it and I can get it from the library for free. Also worth checking out is  “Litanie Des Saints,”   “How Come My Dog Don’t Bark,”  and  “Walk on Guilded Splinters.”                  A veritable Cliff Claven of information regarding tunes. It's always nice to have a different perspective, and random notes of interest.              Danka.

						   Okay, long time no post of any real significance, or amusement value. Apologies tendered all around. I'm a bad, bad, busy girl. *smirks*   Linds' Blues Compilation (Various Artists)   I promised a review of the new Blues/Jazz CD of stuff that I picked, and Luc burned up for me.    Oh My God in Heaven...     This CD, is  orgasmically  good. I tried to stay away from more modern sounding blues, and stick to the gritty, raw emotion filled vocals, grumbly bassed, rock style blues. I think I should have left the  Diana Krall  out, and maybe the very first  Tracy Chapman  track, because they don't really go with the flow of the music, but I wanted the songs anyways.  This is the track listing, and lyrics if I could find all of them:   1. Tracy Chapman --   urlLink "Fast Car"   Quite possibly the saddest, most bittersweet love song ever written that I've heard. With the young dream of leaving everything you know behind to make a fresh start and something better out of life, and finding out you were wrong.   2. Tracy Chapman --   urlLink "Give Me One Reason"   God, I love this song. Modern or no,  the bass line is  sooo  sexy. Recognizable in an instant. I do this song at Karaoke quite frequently.   3. John Lee Hooker --  urlLink "1 Bourbon, 1 Scotch, 1 Beer"   Unbelievably gorgeous song of heartbreak, and the character Johnny, His baby's gone away, he want one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer to get the her off of his mind.   4. Ella Fitzgerald --   urlLink "Mack the Knife"  By far the most original version of  "Mack the Knife"  I've ever heard.  She forgets the lyrics and brilliantly ad libs at least half the song.   5. Ella Fitzgerald --   urlLink "Black Coffee"  This is one of my all time favourite Ella songs. I acquired a compilation 4 disc set of her stuff as a gift, with 60 songs total, and this song, much to my dismay, was not on any of the CD's. So I got it for this mix. Gorgeous.   6. Etta James --   urlLink "At Last"  This is the song that I want to have my first dance to with my husband when I get married. The lyrics are simple and unadorned and very, very sweet.   7.   urlLink B. B. King  -- "There Must be a Better World, Somewhere"  No lyrics for this song unfortunately, at least none that I could find. However, I did find a  GREAT  Biography of  B.B. King . The man is phenomenally accomplished. This is a great tune about how the world can seem to be against you when all you're trying to do is make it through to the next day.   8.   urlLink B. B. King  -- "Why I Sing the Blues"  Basically,  this  song, is a history of Blacks and the struggles that they've gone through. Everything from slavery,the trials and troubles of love, poverty, prison, to the black power movement in the 60's and the treatment they receive.  (However, this version, seems to be completely different from any other lyrics that I've found online that are the same title as this song, all the ones I've found are pretty much just about marriage.)     This song is almost ten minutes long, and a live recording as far as I can tell.    9.  urlLink B. B. King  -- "How Blue Can You Get"  A story about a woman that B.B. may have married,  but probably didn't. Who was  "Evil when you're with me, and jealous when we're apart."  seems that she was quite the nasty lady. This is a live version and the crowd goes just  NUTS  in the background in portions of the song when he wails out the lyrics.   10. Billie Holiday -- urlLink  "Good Morning Heartache"   Billie has a voice that expresses emotion so beautifully, that it's no wonder she's famous. "Good Morning Heartache, sit down." If you can't beat 'em, might as well join 'em.   11. Peggy Lee --   urlLink "Fever"  Not necessarily "Blues" but still, a good song. Everyone I know loves it.  "Chicks were meant to give you Fever, be it Fahrenheit or centigrade."  Damned rights.   12. Stevie Ray Vaughn -- urlLink  "The Sky is Crying"  Oh My God . Everything about this song is amazing. Guitar, vocals, lyrics. Probably one of the few of my absolute favourites of all times. If they had this at karaoke, I guarantee you, that I would sing it every single time.   13. Stevie Ray Vaughn --  urlLink  "I'm Leaving You"  Good Lord this woman is nasty. I think I would want to send her "Swimmin' with the Fishies" too.   14. Stevie Ray Vaughn --   urlLink "Life Without You"  Very bitter sweet love song about love lost, and meeting up with them again afterwards. I originally thought this song wasn't quite what I was looking for in the mix, but it makes up for the stuff about the nasty women in all the other songs. I can empathize with the sentiments in this song.   15. Diana Krall --   urlLink "Peel Me a Grape"  Now, I swear in this song, she says "Boil me a crab," and not "Call me a cab." However it could just be my ears, but I don't think so. It's not like she slurs her words. *shrugs* Very sensual, sexy song, but I think it's too modern a style of Jazz to put on this mix. Oh well.   16. Diana Krall --   urlLink "They Can't Take That Away From Me"  This song is simply about remembering the things that enamoured you to you're lover. Very well played piano. Nice slow walking bass line. I did this song in Jazz Choir in highschool.   17.  urlLink Dr. John  -- "Since I fell for You"  I couldn't find the lyrics for this song either unfortunately. I included a biography of him. He's got a very unique voice. This song is about being in love with someone that has stopped loving you, and how it's too bad that you're still in love with them when "you love me and now you snub me."  That's it. Awesome mix.  Thank-you,  Luc , for letting me browse your collection of Blues/jazz.
