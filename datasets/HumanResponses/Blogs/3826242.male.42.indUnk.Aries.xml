      Starts off disciplined. I will lay particular favourites for say £10. Soon up £20. Then lay short-priced favourite that drifts in the market. Should I back it back for a free bet. Decide not to. After all I am disciplined. Favourite wins. I am down £19. Next race decide to try to get this back plus £10. Lay short-priced favourite that drifts. Should I back back for free bet and no risk? No I decide. Favourite wins. I am now down around £80. Decide to lay the next short-priced favourite. It drifts. Should I back it back for free bet and no risk? No. The same pattern can't happen three times in a row can it? It does. Am now down £138. Draw down £200 from credit card. I am going to get this cash back. Lay next short-priced favourite. It shortens further- dramatically further. Everyone wants to get on this horse. I resign myself to losing another £258 as this now is my libility if I want to win back my previous losses with £15 extra. It loses!! Up a paltry £12 after credit costs taken into account.

      The nature of reality often comes into mind. The greatest mystery being why is there anything rather than nothing? I've come to the conclusion that God dissolved himself aeons ago into the fabric of the cosmos so that He could experience true liberation. After all if you control everything how can you be free? The universe now progresses along its evolutionary path according to certain basic physical laws. We experience them. We are the echoes or pieces of the original divine conciousness. Besides having cosmic thought s I am walking the Ulster Way- a 600 mile or so path around the north of Ireland. I will post the odd picture of my  travels

      Just returned from a trip to the West with The Beloved and her daughter. Called in with the Daughter's father in Barna Co. Galway. He took her for the day so myself and Liz did a little touring around Oughterard and the lovely Lough Corrib. Ended up camping in a remote spot by the lake that night near Glann.&nbsp; Just the sound of fighting terns from a little islet offshore. In the morning a swim in the soft lake water - alright it took me about ten minutes to immerse myself! My expressions were somewhat gargoyle -like. but once I was in it was bliss. Next day we set off&nbsp; for Kerry to try for the second time to get to Skellig Michael.  urlLink http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=757 &nbsp;Skellig is a rocky island off the coast which was inhabited by monks from around 400 AD. It has no springs and very little greenery. The perfect place for a monk to escape the pressures of 6th Century life. It's bloody hard to get to. the conditions have to be just right before the boatmen will venture out. Last Friday was not the day. We arrived as low fog shrouded the islands and surrounding hills creating bizarre mysterious cloudshapes - the 'teasing mists of Skelligs' - perhaps I'll write a song! Next day we headed north to visit friends on the island of Inisbofin. Neither myself or Liz had been on the island before. The sun was splitting the trees as we headed off from Cleggan (perfect weather to land on Skellig!). Cars have to be left behind. The islanders have managed to bring a few battered wrecks onto the island where there's no road tax. On the island we feasted on the most beautiful leg of lamb - bought from a butchers in Clifden - beside the Celtic Shop. A local fisherman left a few mackerel which we fried in butter and smeared with harissa and soy sauce. Delicious!!!! Next day we lounged on the East Side beach - I roasted my balding pate. It's now a kind of pinky purply colour. Long drive back to Belfast where we learned that one of Liz's erswhile mates had died of liver failure at the age of 38. North Belfast is a place of tragedy. Liz went to another funeral today of a woman in her early 40s - the mother of 7 kids who committed suicide last week. One of her sons had killed himself last year.

      2nd July 2004 What does a gambling Buddhist put in a post? Can there be such a thing as a gambling Buddhist. Am I a Buddhist? I attend a sangha here in rainy Belfast on Tuesdays and sometimes Sundays. At the zendo we sit in silence for 30 minutes then walk in silence for ten minutes then meditate again for 45 minutes. On Fridays usually I gamble and lose quite a lot of money. Today I didn't lose. I actually made £14. Last week I lost £345. As a Buddhist I see my gambling as 'grasping'. - chasing after an illusion that cannot ever bring real happiness. What it does bring is momentary gratification. Like any addiction it gives the illusion of power for a few moments before inevitably reality sinks in. Throughout the lifetime of this blog I'll try to give an insight into the mind of a gambler albeit one who wishes he could lead an 'alternative' life.

      Continued along the Ulster Way yesterday - a 600 odd mile traipse around the north of Ireland. A fine evening found us up Shanes Hill Road at Ballyboley Forest. Through a bunch of spruce trees and over a stile or two to a vantage point overlooking Larne. The last time we were up here we could see as far as Scotland to the north-east, the Mournes to the south with a hint of the Isle of man on the horizon and to the west Slemish and the Sperrins and of course Lough Neagh our inland sea. This evening though we had haze - whether pollution or innoccuous heat haze or a mixture of both I don't know. Every month here seems to have a dominant colour. In May the yellow gorse or whin dominates. This month its the purple of the heather and the thistle. The darker bell heather mixes in with the lighter type of heather ( I can't remember the technical term!) I picked blueberries. I never realised they were so common here. My memories of blueberries focus round Norwegian forests where on rare visits as children we coloured our hands and faces purple with the juice. We walked over to the cairned top of Agnews Hill and decided to stop there as the sun was declining rapidly. Walking back we watched as the sun set directly over  urlLink Slemish - St Patrick's Hill. White moths fluttered around us as we made our way back to the car. Black slugs began their dusk feeding. Today I completed the stetch of the walk with Tess, my sisters dog. I drove up the lonely and desolate Starbog Road past the quarry where a couple of years ago a local man was pulled into the crushing machine and killed. Tess had to be lifted over the stiles but frolicked madly in the soft mossy grass. We saw frogs. The weather was misty but warm- no spectacular sunsets this evening!
