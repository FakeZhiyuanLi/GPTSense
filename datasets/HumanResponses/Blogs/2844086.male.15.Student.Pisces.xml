      Lately I've been asking God to take me to another level in my worship. And He's doing just that. I have begun to really just seek true intimacy with the Lord.  I've also just asked Him to move me out of my comfort zone. And yes He has completely. In 2 weeks I have a music recital in which I must play the piano and sing. I can do the piano part, but I'm a little nervous about singing. I have never sang in front of anyone before. So yeah I'll be completely freaking out on the day of the recital. But that's where my faith comes in. I'm singing "How Deep the Father's Love for Us", and it's lyrics are so meaningful and powerful. I really think God is putting me to the test with this recital, because there are some big hurtals that I have to jump over. But if I put my faith in Him, then He'll just pick me up and carry me over them.  After the recital is over I have to sing in front of my church. OK time to faint. :) But I have to learn to do it, because I'm a Worship Leader in the making. Father give me strength.   How Deep the Father's Love for Us  Stuart Townend  How deep the Father's love for us, How vast beyond all measure. That He should give His only son, And make a wretch His treasure.  How great the pain of searing loss, The Father turns His face away. As wounds which mar the Chosen One, Bring many sons to glory.  Behold the Man upon the cross, My sin upon His shoulders Ashamed I hear my mocking voice, Call out among the scoffers.  It was my sin that held Him there Until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life I know that it is finished.  I will not boast in anything No gifts, no power, no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ, His death and resurrection.  Why should I gain from His reward? I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart, His wounds have paid my ransom.

      Ok first maybe you need to know a little about me before I begin posting. I'm 15-years-old, and I have 2 days of 9th grade left (that's counting today)! OH whew I'm excited!  Anyway God has already given me my calling, and that is to be worship leader. Now if you knew me personally you would probably be as sceptical as I was when I first received my calling. I'm not shy, but I'm not that outgoing ... and well let's just say that I don't fit the profile of someone being in front of the church every Sunday and Wednesday leading a choir. But God told me to do it so I will be obedient to Him.  So right now I'm learning all I can about singing and music period. I've been playing piano for about 4 years, so I know a good bit about music. In fact I might be teaching some beginning lessons this summer. I also have a recital in 3 weeks that I'm really nervous about. So I'm sure that if your going to be reading my blog frequently then you'll be hearing a lot about it.  Anyway I guess I've pretty much covered all there is about me. I have another blog where I just write about my day and stuff.  urlLink God's Work  is what I call it. You can check it out if you want.  So that's pretty much it. I'll be posting later about something exciting.

      Just simple news. God has heard my prayers of teaching me to worship Him, because He is doing just that. Even as I write this I'm trying to get back to life, which is hard after what I just experienced. I am so in awe of God right now. I just realize that I am nothing. I don't even deserve to worship the Lamb upon the throne.  Yesterday while I was listening to Dr. David Jeremiah's "Escape the Coming Night" series, I was just drawn to the song, "We All Bow Down". And I listened to it, and now I'm hooked. This song just reminds me of when all the elders in the book of Revelation fall down and worship the one who sits on the throne.   We All Bow Down  Lenny LeBlanc  Princes and paupers, Sons and Daughters Kneel at the throne of grace Losers and winners, saints and sinners One day will see His face  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God  Summer and Winter, the mountains and rivers Whisper the Savior's name Awesome and Holy, a friend to the lonely Forever His love will rain  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God  He is the Light of the world And Lord of the Cross  And we all bow down Kings will surrender their crowns And worship Jesus He is the love, unfailing love He is the love of God

      Today for some reason I just feel God's calling on my heart more than ever to be in His ministry. I don't know why its today, but this week I have been reading  Youth Walk Magazine  devotional called the Body. And it's all about using your spiritual gifts. And you know that's exactly what I think God is trying to show me what to do right now.  For so long I have just been terrified to sing in front of anyone, and God is just telling me that I will overcome that fear if I lay it down. And I have to sing in front of the Church this Sunday and that's majorly important to me. Recital was important, but this is a bigger step. I'm going to be ministering to someone. THAT'S A BIG DEAL!! But it's what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life.  I'm embracing what God has called me to do. And I will eagerly work to be the best that I can be.  Sunday night I will not perform to the crowds, I will worship my amazing God. May I lead others with me.

      Wow! Ok here follows some events of yesterday, June 3, 2004.  The day of the recital. I was completely flipping out. It crept upon me silently. I did not know my piano piece! Yeah, I know! That's what I said too. So I went up to the church to practice on a piano that was actually in tune! HA! Not a very pretty site, I must comment. Or would it be sound? Ok so yeah. By now I'm really scared, because like 20 minutes ago I played it great at home. But not now!  So here it is, the day of the recital, and I can't remember any of my piece, (I promise I had it memorized, except like 2 measures) it doesn't sound good with or without the music. So I did one of the few things I could do ... panic. I practiced like 5 more times, and it seemed as if each time I got worse. My hands got very stiff because they were cold. I get cold when I get nervous, and I WAS NERVOUS!  Now as you probably read in the last post, I had to sing as well. I've never done that. I had to sing before I got to play.  Anyway, the recital started, and all the beginners made mistakes so that kind of made me feel good. :) I know that's terrible, but I can't help it! Anyway when we got to the singers my nerves had yet to flare up, which was a good sign. On the list I was the LAST singer! AHH! Let me tell ya.  Ok now I must say that all the singers did very well! I was very pleased with what I heard. So Sis. Amy gets up and calls my name. And I have to play all this out like blink by blink because this is great. I could tell that the people who knew me and had not heard me sing yet didn't really think that I would do so well. Yes I could tell (ok maybe I was hallucinating!). So I walked up there with confidence (I'll explain where that came from at the end of this). I adjusted the mic and took a breath. Ms. Rhonda was in the sound booth, and I smiled and nodded to go ahead. She smiled back, and started the track. I was breathing heavy now, and yes, I was nervous. But when I took that breath and hit that first note, my fear left, and everything was ok. It was like  yeah this is what I'm supposed to be doing . And I worshiped the Lord with that song and really felt that I lead someone else in worship. I hope I did.  And after I finished there was like a sense of shock in the room. I was shocked. I think that is the best I have ever sang that song. I'm serious. And  I have never received so many compliments in my whole entire life!  I wish whoever reads this could have been there.   Anyway, after that I had to play my piano piece. Now Jesseka, my friend, me, and Andrew, my other friend, all had one big piece, we just had different sections of it. It was not very good! I mean it was terrible. But we still held our heads high and played it the best we could.  Then Ms. Rhonda came to the front of the Church to hand out awards. She called me up there to help her. So we've handed out about 3 awards, and then she looked at me and said "OK Chad you're gonna have to give this next award to yourself". I was like what?! And she gave me the Oustanding Voice award! That meant so much to me!  Everyone was telling me how awesome I sounded and how they were just in shock! It was truely overwhelming and very humbling. Then Ms. Debbie gave me a card and the last thing she said was "I'll be looking for you at the Dove Awards!" That made me cry.  But here is what happened. See I was really dying before all of it started, and I stopped and said, I will not let my fear keep me from doing God's Will. So I prayed, "Lord, I lay my fear at the foot of the cross. I ask that you would take this burden off of me." And I just let go and worshiped God when I sang, and I praised Him while I played. No I didn't do the best, but I did MY best and that's all that matters to me. I know the LORD was beside me all night smiling in favor.  I'm so blessed and I guess in some way I see why God has called me into the Music Ministry. And I see what He's doing about getting me there!  Oh yeah someone has already asked me to sing at their church! I'm so amazed right now, and all I can do is just praise my Father!    Now the new challenge is to find something else I can sing!

       Worship is now becoming natural to me. It's beginning to be easier just to surrender to God and worship Him. I'm so hungry for God now, that I just can't help myself. I believe it's because I'm giving control to the Holy Spirit.    &nbsp;  Sunday night I was baptised in the Holy Ghost again. It was awesome. That's just powerful worship to me. And it's the transfer of power. I feel confident and bold in my faith more than ever. Being filled with the Spirit is the best thing that you could ask for.    &nbsp;  Now I'm focusing on prayer, which is a main ingredient in worship. I'm learning how to be more disciplined in prayer. I have a notebook that I've been writing down things to pray for in. It's been a great tool for me, because of my short term memory. I feel like I'm really drawing closer to the heart of God as well.    &nbsp;  Juanita Bynum has completely revolutionized my life as well. The other night I heard her preaching on the threashing floor. It's when you get down on your face before God. She also made a guarantee, that when you get on the threashing floor you will hear from God in 48 hours or less. And it's true (see post below).    &nbsp;  Sometimes I can't even pray for praising God. And it's truly a place where I think moving worship takes place. In Revelation, numerous times did the elders fall on their faces and worship.    &nbsp;  Anyway that's how it's been going lately. God's plan is unfolding. What's awesome is I'm in it!

      Oh my goodness. I was so scared tonight. Ok my music minister, Sister Amy, walked up to me today @ 4 o'clock and said, "you're singing tonight, right?"  I easily answered "Uhh no!", but I thought she was playing. The thing is ... she wasn't. And she said, "Well you're on the special singer's list for tonight." That completely blew me away. I had no clue that I had to sing tonight! So I did what I always do. Flip out!  But it turned out good, because the Lord heard my cries. And You wanna know what the really funny thing is? Last night I was praying, and I asked God to use me in whatever way He chose. I didn't specify when, and I guess He took advantage of that! :) I just wasn't expecting Him to use me in the next 20 hours!  But anyway I really hope that I lead someone in worship tonight. And I hope that I really touched someone. I sang, "Wonderful, Merciful, Savior", originally recorded by Selah. And I hope that I just really blessed someone's life tonight. May the Lord have received glory tonight! 'Cause He's gonna get it anyway.

      I don't know why, but lately God is just pressing into my soul, songwriting, songwriting, songwriting. And I keep saying, Lord, give me something to write, and I will write!  God gave me a song about a year and a half ago. I named it "Most High", and I have it finished. Well I'm a little iffy about one part. It's my first complete worship song, though. I think that God has plans for it, because He keeps bringing it up when I pray about songwriting. But the thing is there is no music. Yes, I know ... How can you have a song without music? Well there is music, but it's in a place where its going to be hard to reach... My head!  But it will come. Lord, please let it come!! I'm completely in need of it. Maybe it's already there though, and I just won't let it flow. What if it's me? Could I really be holding back God's potential for me?

      Wow! Man oh Man. Let me tell you that I have had the best time at church all week! It has just been amazing. God has just revealed Himself more than ever. I am just so amazed. I can't even explain what happened this week.  I now have an even deeper love for my Savior than ever before. And I really believe that my church has gone deeper in the Spirit. And I believe that we're on the verge of really seeing God's glory! I really wish that all the churches all across this nation could experience what we experienced this week.  I bless the Lord for all that He has done and all that He is going to do.  And I thank everyone for reading this Blog I know you don't have to but yet you do.

      Hey Everyone! Sorry I haven't posted anything in a while, but my church is in revival all week so i haven't had the time. It's great too. I mean let me tell you tell you.  Woe is I! It's already been out a day and I have yet to see it! Most will know that I am talking about "The Passion". Oh but I have heard many people talk about how wonderful it is. I so can't wait. I just know that it's going to be awesome.  Anyway I'm really sick! And I'm tired. But don't think that is going to stop me from going to revival. 'Cause it's not! I'm telling you though I really believe that God is going to manifest Himself. I really and truly believe that I am going to see Him tomorrow. And I'm telling you that even if I don't, I have already experienced Him more than I ever have.

      Hey everyone.  It's been a while since I've posted. But to give you a quick overview of what's going on: NOTHING!  :)  I'm teaching Sunday School this coming Sunday!!! I'm so excited. But that excitedness is kind of being  weighed down, because I'm just really depressed about my school. I feel like there is no one who believes in Jesus. They just run Him down to the ground, so to speak, by the way they live.  What do I mean by that? Well lets take the biggest thing in High School for example. SEX. They have sex and then they come to school and boast about it. Like they've done something special. Basically they're justifying what they are doing. And I want to go up to them and shake them and ask them "What's wrong with you? Don't you know that you're hurting yourself?"  And there's so much fighting going on, and it's driving me crazy! Sometimes I wish that some people could expirence hell for about 30 seconds. That may sound bad, but I know that would light their fire.    I just have this heavy burden on my soul. It's hurting too. I feel like I can't do anything to help anyone. I just need to pray about it and pray for some people.  If you're reading this will you please send me an e-mail?! Please I need to hear from somebody!  CHAD

      Happy Valentines Day Everyone!!!  Man oh man. I'm so tired. I had to go to early piano lessons today. I found out that the Minister of Music at my church wants me to join the choir!! I'm so excited! Jesus just keeps opening doors for me to get me to where He wants me to be.  I should tell you since I haven't put it in yet, but God has placed a calling on my life to be a Minister of Music. So you know I'm doing everything I can to learn about music and just learning how to be a faithful servant.  Anyway I started working on a song that I haven't worked on in a while. If I ever get it finished and get it copyrighted I'll post the lyrics. But you know since it's not legally mine, if I posted it and someone decided it to make it their's then you know they could get away with it. So for now you'll just have to wait.  I do have 25% songwriter credit on one song though. It's called "True Love Waits". Very cool song.  But anyway I just wanted to write something since I didn't write yesterday.  Someone send me an e-mail! My Inbox is kind of empty!

      Ok well lets see if I have any time to actually get this written. I have a major economics project that is due tomorrow.  But today, LOST PENNY DAY, was pretty much a success. I mean I think that I did get through to most people. Yet the people who needed it really didn't get the message. And some of my friends kind of made a joke out of the verse, and I got mad and scolded them for doing such to GOD'S WORD.  I didn't get to go to youth group last night and I really wish that I had. But you know I really dislike my youth group. I mean some people come to associate and others come to hear from GOD, but the people who are there for the wrong reasons kind of mess it up for others. And you know my friend (who goes to the church that I pulled out from) told me that her youth group is really on fire now. And I really want, you know, to expirience the Fire again and be in fellowship with other on fire Christians but I really want to stay with my youth group that i'm with now.  I don't know what to do other than pray for the people that come. And I know that God will hear my prayers, but I just hope that something happens soon.  Ok so I'll post later. I gotta run!!

      Man oh man I'm so tired. But you know I'm kinda getting into all of this Blogging stuff. It's really kind of cool once you start doing it. I really just hope that there is someone out there who is reading. In my next few sentences you'll understand why.  Tomorrow me and 2 of my friends are gonna do this kind of witnessing thing. So I need prayer. See tomorrow is Lost Penny Day and so what we are doing is: I took some pennies and hot-glued some safety pens on them so we can wear them. And I took the scripture Luke 15:8-10 and made some flyers. Now what we're supposed to do is when people ask, "why are you wearing a penny?", give them the flyer. But what is probably going to end up happening is we're just gonna hand them out to people saying "Happy Lost Penny Day".  And Lord willing hopefully we'll just be able to "plant some seeds" in people's lives. So if you would please pray that God will just allow us to minister to people and that we'll have the strength and guts to follow through with it.  Oh yeah and for all you nice people who read this, Thank you so much for taking the time to do so.  GOD ROCKS! HE ROCKS MY FACE OFF!

      Oh my goodness last night was so awesome. Karen Wheaton and Chosen came to my home town!! Oh my goodness I can't even explain to you the presence of God last night. But it was such an awesome expirience.  I got baptised in the Holy Ghost for the first time in my life and it was just amazing. I mean God just became so incredibly close. I'm talking crazy I know to some of you people but I just can't explain it.  God I just lift you up and I praise you for everything. Be the center of my life Lord and just shine through me!

      I know that I just posted and all but I can do whatever I want. (KIDDING!) :)  Anyway I keep having Deja Vu and it's driving me crazy. My friend is now convinced that I'm a prophet! It's so funny. I do believe, though, that we can all prophesy. And God has actually spoken to me before. But I don't think this Deja Vu is all about prophecy.  You know I reread my last post and it really didn't make sense! :) But I'm not gonna change it. Anyway I'm still really bored. My friend is giving a crash course in Mainstream music because i don't listen to it. But i'm about to give her a crash course in CCM and Worship Music. So I guess I'll just sign off for real this time.  :) SMILE! GOD LOVES YA!

      I feel really bad. Not the sickness-cold kinda bad but bad. I really need something to do. I should practice my piano and I will just not right now. And I so don't want to go to school tomorrow. I'm just sick of it.  I don't feel God today. Why I don't know. I didn't go to church, but that's never hendered His presence from me. I'm sure he's here though. Sometimes we just can't feel God even when He's right there. But I long to feel him.  A good song is "In the Secret" by Sonic Flood. I'll post some of the lyrics.   I want to know you/ I want to hear your voice/I want to know you more/ I want to touch you/ I want to see your face/ I want to know you more   So anyway I guess I'll stop here.

      I've never Blogged before so I guess i have to give a little info about me. My name is Chad and I'm 14 (almost 15!!). I'm a freshman in highschool right now and I hate it. I'm sure that if your reading my blogs then you'll definately hear about my expirences there. And I'll guess I'll leave it at that. But anyway if your reading this and really want someone to talk to then you can e-mail me @ Godsdude4life@hotmail.com  Well today I am so bored and it is not even funny. I'm really just trying to finish this song I started writing. My music teacher (who is published song writer) told me to think about a few things that I put in it. It's kind of depressing, but I love it. She told be something about making it where the "hearer" could be part of the song not just hear what I have to say. Well I think that people should hear what I have to say. But she knows best I would think. :)  Anyway for now I'll leave it at this.

      Well I haven't written in a while so I guess I need to start off with where I've been. In Tennessee. YES that's right I've been in Tennessee from March 11-14! And it was great! I went to WinterFest 2004.  Let me tell ya. It rocked out! 20,000 screaming people were there and we had some church!! I mean it was awesome. I feel spiritually energized.  Oh yeah and March 13 was my birthday!! That's right I'm officially 15 writing this!! OH YEAH! I'm supposed to go and get my learners sometime this week. But who knows ya know, I'm so busy.  But anyway I stayed out of school yesterday, and I missed school Friday, so I have homework to be doing.

      Hey everyone.  Wow! I know I kinda start every post out with wow or man oh man or something, but Wow!  I saw the best movie last night! Yes you are correct.  The Passion of the Christ !! Oh my goodness. If you haven't seen this movie! GO AND SEE IT. I'm telling you that this is awesome. It's so powerful and moving that I can hardly stand it (in a good way, that is). I can't write anything about the movie because there are simply no words to describe what you see. I like what Billy Graham said, "Mel Gibson has accompished in 2 hours, what I have tried to accomplish in 40 years."  All I can say is, it was beautiful. I'm not saying that this is everything now, but it really gets you thinking. It's like they had a video camera back then.  But I'm telling you. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You're just crazy if you don't.

I'm telling everone that it's my favorite movie and I haven't even seen it yet.  So right now i'm just reading an excerpt from  Glorious Appearing . It's very interesting. But I'm kinda lost you know cause I'm still on book 2!! :) But I think I can figure it out.  So anyway I guess tomorrow I'll post my feelings on the movie.

      Hey everyone!  I'm sorry that it's been a while, but school and after school activities are taking up a lot of my time. Anyway I don't guess anything new has happened since WinterFest except I got my drivers linces like 3 days after that post!  I'm kinda scared to drive though. Too many crazy people out there, and I hate having someone in the car with me.  Oh wait I just remembered something. We went to Teen Talent and the Band (singers included) won contemporary praise category! So in August I'm headed to San Antonio!! OH YEAH! The drama team didn't win anything which makes me really mad 'cause we worked hard. But it'll be ok.  Anyway i gotta run to Church for practice and then Church! Maybe I'll actually be able to start posting soon!  oh yeah I've also published some stuff at  urlLink poetry.com . Just go there and type in my name.

      I am so tired right now! Today we had Yearbook day at school. It was pretty fun. I wish I had taken the test to get on the staff. But I'll take it next year. So no big.  Anyway I've really got to get practicing for my piano recital because I don't have my piece memorized, and I can hardly get through it. But it's so hard to practice because my piano is out of tune. I think I might throw up.  But it's ok. Because I get out of school on the 18! School really gets out on the 21st but I don't have to take finals so I get the last three days off! OH YEAH!  I'm feeling kinda down lately. I just don't feel very good. Everything at school is kind of falling apart, and I don't want it too. It was perfect (yeah right) ok it was going ok until about a week ago. I don't know what happened but it's like the whole place is just going balistic. I think it's because we're all on the verge of getting out but we're still in. :) does that make any sense?  Anyway I might have a job this summer! OK now don't laugh, but me, Andrew Sapp, and Jesseka are going to build web pages for people! Of course all the money goes to the music fund at church. But we get a little bit! OH YEAH! I don't know how long that will last though, cause even though i can write some HTML, I'm not the best person to be building professional sites. But hey I'll do my best.  Anyway I gotta go. The piano calls me.

      Lately everything is going so crazy. I don't know what God has planned to come out of everything that is going on, but I trust Him. I mean Rana is just like so not cool anymore. And the drama team is like falling apart.  I'm almost to the point where I wish I had never gotten involved. I know I shouldn't feel like that, but I do. I mean ... I don't know.    Lord, if you are testing me, then just help me to stay strong. Because I feel broken. I'm like just confused.

      I'm so sick of people telling me that I can't be what God told me I'm going to be. I almost wish I could prove myself. But then I take that back, because I don't have to prove myself to anyone. I just wish that someone would accept my calling. Well Ms. Rhonda believes in me. I think that Mama has finally accepted it.  Still there are people like Grandmama, Jesseka, and just about the rest of the world that try to bring me down. Bryan Davis posted a message on the Youth Group guest book. It was very helpful. Messages of encouragement are so precious in a time like this.  Lord, my prayer is that You would just hold me up when people's words tear me down.  AMEN!

      Man it was so fun today! We had a car wash to try and raise money for the Teen Talent trip. It was so fun! I just love hanging out with my friends. We were like harassing people. Ok well not really, but it was quite funny!! I wouldn't mind doing it again sometime. Not anytime soon, but sometime!  Anway I know its been a while since i last posted. I'm sorry! So I guess i have to catch you up. Ok well nothing happened. :) But I was forced to take drivers ed! yeah i know that's what I said too! (that's my new saying.) Oh yeah and the music recital was June 3rd! to read about that click  urlLink here . And that's about all thats been going on. Oh yeah and sang at church June 13! Whew, big step for me. Anyway, I'm wiped out from the car wash so perhaps I will update another day.

       Life lately has been pretty awesome. God has really just been teaching me a lot, changing me, and molding me. He's been doing that to a lot of people. Worship is becoming natural to me, which is awesome.     &nbsp;   Now prayer is becoming a major focus in my life. I know prayer is a powerful thing. Hopefully I won't take that lightly. I'm trying to discipline myself in prayer. It's so hard though. I mean I can pray it's just so hard to find time. I guess when i go back to school I'll have to make time.     &nbsp;   Speaking of school, I have yet to get those two books read. I'll be reading at the last minute. I'm hoping to be done before I go to San Antonio, because I know I won't get them read out there. So I have 2 weeks.     &nbsp;   Oh yeah before I forget, the band has a new name! We're now called, Sea of Glass! How cool is that? It's based on Revelation 15. It's really cool. I, personally, like it. I think everyone in the band does too. I'm beginning to grow on them too. I mean I kind of have to since the drama team is completely falling apart. But hopefully everything will pull together. I'll be praying about it.     &nbsp;   Church was really awesome tonight. I thought it went well. I'm really expecting God to do something great. I just have a feeling that lives are gonna be changed. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit just begin to take control of the services.     &nbsp;   Bro. Ryan is getting us geared up in evangelism. I'm really gonna try to reach someone this upcoming school year. Liana is really the only person  I  know that is unsaved. I mean I know that there are plenty of other people, but she's the one I know. If I ever see Holly, I'm gonna try to get her to start going to church. It's kind of scary, but then again, it shouldn't be. The worst thing that could possibly happen is, their response be "No".     &nbsp;   Anyway I have to do some more blog updating in my other blogs. So yeah... :)

      I'm sorry if you're reading this. I've been out of town all day, so once again I didn't get to ... what? Practice. :) But I did make it to my voice lesson today.  And I also heard about the Teen Talent National judges. AHH! I'm guessing that if you've been to the Piano Miestro site, you kind of have a clue about what Teen Talen is.  But it's late and it's still bad weather so I have to go before I get disconnected.

      Ok well I'm sorta in a rush today. So here's my practice:   Scales  - Terrible! I'm serious. All of my scales were really bad today. Even C Major, which I stumbled all over. I'm seriously embarrassed to write this.  Cadences  - OK. I think that these were OK. Don't ask me about first inversion. Terrible! On both C and G.  Hanon  - I had to practice all of them just because 7 is so hard, and I don't really feel that I'm getting anything out of practicing it hands separate.  Technic  - I didn't even practice it. I did practice my inversions, but I didn't practice "Snowmobiling".  Piano  - I didn't have this in time today, but I think I'll have it once I get to practice it again right.   Spinning Song   - I didn't practice this either. I know, I know. I should have, but I didn't.  Ok, want my excuse? :) I didn't have time to really practice today. That's truly why I didn't pummel everything. I'm a serious practicer. I do really practice, just not this week. But don't worry next week shall be different.

      Well today has definately not been a good day. It's been really bad weather here. I've been in fear that a pine tree was going to fall on my house! And I've been sick all day.  So I've had absolutely no practice today, which will probably show tomorrow when I go to practice. But I just couldn't. Well I could have :), but I didn't.  So check back tomorrow.

      I've had a little more practice today that usual. I'm actually really proud of myself. I practiced an hour today! I know some people practice a lot more than that, but I'm really happy with an hour. I'd like to get up to about an hour and a half a day.  So anyway, here's my log:  Scales  - Sounded really nice today! I'm very pleased, though I stumbled on A Major a little just because I wanted to play A minor first I guess! :)  Cadences  - I really didn't want to play Cadences today, but I did. And you know they go by really fast once you start playing them. All were very good.  Hanon  - I HATE Hanon #7!!! It's like way hard. I mean I knew the guy was crazy, but he was just insane!!  Technic  - "Snowmobiling" is still in progress, yet it still needs lots of work. And I'm still practicing my inversions which make it easier. But broken chord inversions are just hard!  Piano  - I'm played "Reveille" perfectly today!! I mean I got all the turns and everything was on time! OHH! That makes me smile!   Spinning Song   - Ok I know I should have, but I did. I put my hands together. Hey don't worry it wasn't really practice, because it all fell apart. :) But I did practice it like I should. I hate practicing the left hand though, it's so redundant, and I lose my place ... and it's frustrating!  I've been thinking again. Since I am a voice student, maybe I should post that practice too. Which there's nothing really to that, but I could still do it. I'll think about it.

      Monday's are when I have my piano lesson, so I usually don't practice on Mondays (except my scales!). But I didn't have a lesson today so I got some practice today. I also had to teach a student's lesson today! I'm a student teacher in the making, I guess you could say. I think it was a pretty good session.  So here's my practice:  Scales  - All were very well. I think I'm trying to play them to fast though, so this week I'm going to play them slowly. Have you tried that lately? Sometimes I find it funny that it's harder to play them slower, because when you play them faster you don't really think about the notes that you play, you just go!  Cadences  - Really strong today! I'm happy with how they are coming. 1st inversion with G Major was good actually.  Hanon  - I tried putting #7 hands together. AHHH! Very Hard! This one might take me a while!  Technic  - First off I've been wondering lately, "Why did James Bastien spell it technic when its technique?" Anyway, "Snowmobiling" is very slow, but it's together. And yes, I practiced my inversions.  Piano  - I almost have Reveille! I just keep messing up going from the A minor to the E Major. SO CLOSE!  "Spinning Song"  - I cannot wait until I get to put hands together on this song. Sometimes the counting throws me, but I really think that I have it!  But today I really missed the Master's Class! (That's a theory class for all of you who don't know.) :) But I can wait until next week.

      Ok well today I didn't have time to practice really. Well I did have a little time, but I'm just so tired because we (Unity Performing Arts and Unity Youth Band) had a car wash. But I did practice all of my scales. Because here's the motto:   The scale is  EVERYTHING . If I can play scales, then I can play anything in any key. Because the scale is everything.   So I did at least practice them. So here's a practice tip. If you have like just 5 minutes to practice, then don't just skip practicing. You can use that 5 minutes to at least practice your scales.  Even though I don't have a clue to who these guys are, they have  really good quotes.   "Do you ask me how good a player you may become? The tell me how much you practice the scales."  -Carl Czerny   "Scales should never be dry. If you are not interested in them, work with them until you do become interested in them."  -Artur Rubinstein  So I guess that's all the advice I can give you today! :) That's on the house by the way, but I will start charging extra!  :) I KID, I KID!  Go Practice!

      Well my practice went really good today. I was very pleased. When I went to the church today for my voice lessons, I also had to take a piano lesson because Ms. Rhonda has jury duty next week.  I kinda sorta learned how to sight sing today! Ok well I'm learning i should say. It was a fun voice class today. Instead of playing for the voice class today I was part of it. Then we used my private voice time to do my makeup lesson.  So ok here's my practice log for the day:  Scales  - all were really good today. Even A flat, but I did have a little trouble w/ D flat on the way down, but I think it's just beacuse I'm not used to doing 4 octaves.  Cadences  - All were really easy. 1st inversion for G Major is still a little ruff though. I know where the F# is in it now, but the fingering is killing me.  Technic  - "Snowmobiling" is still hands separate but I'm going to put them together tomorrow. I love INVERSIONS! Yeah as much as I love spiders! :)  Piano  - "Reveille" is still coming along. I actually almost have it down pat.  "Spinning Song"  - I love this song! It's gonna be hard to put hands together, but it's still fun. If you're learning inversions and their importance, then you should definately learn this song. Albert Ellmenreich composed it.  After I finished practicing I realized that I didn't practice Hanon. I assure you it wasn't on purpose. But don't worry we covered it in my lesson! :)  Have a great day! Go Practice!

      Here's today's practice:   Scales  -  All were good except A flat. It always gives me trouble. All flats were kinda bad though, because I'm still working them up to 4 octaves.  Hanon  - 1-4 @ mm. 120, personally I think 4 still needs a little work. 5 @ mm 112, it was ok, gave my fingers a workout. 6 is really bad on the way down! 7 is hands separate and way too hard! :)  Cadences  - All are becoming easier! C & G in first inversion are coming along. C is really good, but G is h-a-r-d, because the F# keeps throwing me.  Technic (book)  - Ah inversions, how I loathe thee. But yet I still practice them. Ms. Rhonda says that they'll become easier. Obviously not today! My left hand is weak though.  Piano (book)  - Reveille is coming along better, now that I'm hitting the "turn" notes. Thanks for pointing that out Ms. Rhonda. Moving the evil inversions are still slowing me down though.  Spinning Song (performance piece)  - I'm really enjoying this piece. I just have to get used to counting it (1 e & a). I think I can do it though.

      Hey everyone! My name is Chad (heh, hence the name of the blog), and I'm a piano/voice student. My music teacher, Rhonda Trull, asked me to begin posting my practice online. I had already been keeping a practice journal, but since it ties in with her site,  urlLink here , she asked me to put online.  So anyway, I guess I can share a little light on who I am. I'm 15 years old and I go to Wayne County High School. To read more about that click  urlLink here . I've been taking piano lessons for 5 years in August, and I've been taking voice lessons for almost a year.  I'll be recording: my practice, problems I'm having with songs, how songs make me feel, etc. Now there is one rule for me, and i'll share it with y'all.  NO PERSONAL STUFF  in this journal. Of course if the song makes me feel someway about what's going on in my life at the moment, I might let  that  slide. I learn from the Bastien Piano books series. I'll post a list of the books I have if anyone wants them (that's only about 6 or 7!). And I should post practice everyday, except Sundays. Rarely do I practice on Sundays.  So i hope that you find my blog slightly helpful in your musical journey!  :) HAVE A GREAT DAY! AND PRACTICE!  Oh yeah and if you want to drop me a line, my e-mail is Godsdude4life@hotmail.com

       Ok so I haven't posted in a while, and I'm going to be very honest why. Well it all started when my computer got stolen!... just kidding! The real reason is because I haven't practice but twice in the last 2 weeks. I know it's terrible, but I've really been busy. I need to find time though. I really don't have time enough to do all that I need to do in a day!!    &nbsp;  Anyway today I finally practiced! It felt really good too. So here it is:    Scales  - All were shocking-ly well. I mean I didn't falter on any of them. I was happy. :)    Cadenses  - It was really scary, but all of these were really good, too!    Hanon  - Really gave me a work out.   You miss a lot when you don't practice!      Technic  - Now I did have a little trouble on my inversions the first time, mainly because I looked. Yeah I know Ms. Rhonda. Anyway after that I played them very well. "Snowmobiling" was ok. it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible, I just need to work it back up.    Piano  - Ok here is the very rich part of my practice! On "Reville", I faltered not once! I KNOW!!! AHH! I was happy. I played it perfect. I didn't have to look at my left hand, when I moved it. Whew that just makes me happy.    &nbsp;  And that's all I practiced. Now I have to work on Master's Class homework, which is to write music to the story Ms. Rhonda gave us. I really have a hard time at this stuff.    &nbsp;  So hopefully I'm back to inspiring you to practice! Hey don't roll your eyes! :) Just kidding.

      Hey everyone!  Finally I get to post. Sorry that I haven't posted in a few days. I guess the server has been down or something because I haven't been able to log in. Anyway I'm not going to post all of that practice that I didn't get to post because it wasn't good practice. I mean I practiced, but everyday I continually got worse. So I don't think you would have been encouraged to practice!  But anyway. Today I'm really lost. See Ms. Rhonda told me not to practice this week because of what kept happening. So all this week I'm not going to be posting any practice because I won't be practicing! But I might post something so keep checking!
